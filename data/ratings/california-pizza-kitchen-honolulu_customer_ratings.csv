1104,Aga G.,"Ewa Beach, United States",107,2,,4.0,2012-01-03,"CPK is on of my favorite restaurants. They have a variety of pizzas and pasta. I always order the BBQ Original Pizza, its delicious because its sweet but not too sweet. the lettuce wraps as an appetizer is also one of my favorites because it's unique. The service there was pretty good the waiter always checked on us. Overall the place was Great!!

I love to try the new items, but ultimately I  stick with what I always get, the bbq chicken chop salad and the tortilla soup. If you LOVE tortilla soup, you HAVE to try CPK's. There is a freshness to it and the little tortilla strips add a nice crunch. The soup is thick and delightful. I want to eat it just writing about it.  The only thing that is bothersome is the WAIT! Wow. This can sometimes take forever. Understandable. Heard it was one of the most busy CPK's in the world.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu?start=420,3.8,3.59,3.608,3.728,3.674

When I feel like splurging on lunch but don't have an appetite for any of the other restaurants at the mall, I always choose you. I'm so gracious for your excellent quality control and pleasant service. Hubby and I dined in for lunch today since we haven't been here in so long. I ordered your cranberry, chicken, walnut focaccia sandwich with artichoke and broccoli soup and hubby had your cobb salad (our go-to salad) with vinaigrette dressing. This was my first time ordering this sandwich and it was good! The only thing I didn't like about my meal was that the soup was a little bland. I would've rated you 5 stars, but unfortunately I came here with taste buds ready for your dijon chicken sandwich (I've only had this once last year and I was craving it). However, to my dismay, it was no longer on the menu and in a panic, I had to quickly decide on another sandwich. Why do good things have to go? Why?? WHY!?! :( Despite my disappointment, I will continue to come back here (but only for lunch or take out - dinner wait is ridiculous).",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu?start=260,3.8,3.59,3.608,3.728,3.674

I didn't think people would want to come here on new years. I used to love CPK, but I was pretty disappointed the last time I came. Food: We ordered the tomato basil pizza and the spinach artichoke dip to share. I was disappointed that we ordered so little. I was planning on ordering a bunch of appetizers, but since they keep changing the menu all of the things I was going to order were gone! The spinach artichoke dip was $10.79 and in my opinion I think they should give less (shocking coming from me) and charge less. There was a lot of dip left over after we were done with our chips AND extra pita bread. The dip is still very tasty. The pizza however, was not how I remembered. The crust was fluffy and soft. I remember their crust being thin and crispy. It wasn't really worth what we paid for. It tasted like cheesy bread with tomatos on top. Our bill came out to about $30 (tip and one drink included) which was a bit pricy for what we ordered. Service: This restaurant is always busy, so the service isn't the fastest or the greatest. Our waitress was very friendly and did the best job she could.  Overall: This location is pretty cool because of the nice view, but you can't see it unless you're sitting on one of the few tables outside.

201,Kim M.,"Honolulu, HI",2771,835,1320.0,4.0,2012-01-26,"The bf and I like CPK, but don't dine here as often as we'd like. The biggest issue we have with CPK is the wait; and this one is ALWAYS busy. The food, service, and experience are all very consistent with the time before. The food comes out quick and hot, water is refilled, and everyone is rather pleasant and nice. The lucky times we did not incur ridiculous wait-times and we got a seat, we were in and out. I swear, the service at this place is quick and on point. Love it. Another thing I really appreciate is their picky-eater-friendly variety! Pizza, pasta, salad, Mac n Cheese, red velvet, and a whole lot more. Relatively recently CPK has revamped their menu and has also added the ""Small Cravings Menu,"" featuring smaller picking-size portions. The bf and I love this added option bc it gives us a chance to try new things without over ordering. And most of the items we've tried so far were good!  Lately we've been into sharing the full-sized BBQ chicken salad with avocado for our entrée. Sounds boring, but we always kick it up with Cholula!! Seriously, you'll never want another CPK salad once you've tried this BBQ one with Cholula. ;) Trust! Also, since we are sharing the salad, we have more room for appetizer and picking options. ;) The Tortilla Spring Rolls (appetizer) are pretty tasty. Two rolls for $9; three rolls for $11. And there are 3 different styles to choose from:  1- Mediterranean: a mix of Mediterranean-influenced flavors and ingredients including Portobello mushrooms, eggplant, sun-dried tomatoes, Fontina, Mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses, served with a sun-dried tomato marinara.  2- Baja Chicken: stuffed with Monterey Jack and Cheddar cheeses, corn, black beans, chilies, red onions, cilantro, and served with homemade guacamole. (Ask for the ranchito sauce too!) 3- Thai Chicken: with bean sprouts, scallions, carrots, cilantro and Mozzarella, and a Thai peanut sauce.  *Out of the 3, the Baja is my fave. :) Of course, their famous Spinach Artichoke Dip (appetizer) is a no brainer... Sometimes we ask for pita and bread instead of chips. :) The Spicy Chicken Tinga Quesadilla is delicious. Perfect for two to share as a mini appetizer. (Off the Small Cravings Menu) There's a lot going on in this mini quesadilla, so I feel like we are getting our $$-worth. It's got bell peppers, lime chicken, a couple cheeses, a dash of chipotle sauce, black beans, cilantro, and more. Served with their addicting homemade ranchito sauce :) Yummy.  The only thing I tried that I wasn't too fond of was the Crispy Mac 'N' Cheese, which is also off the Small Cravings Menu. I love Mac n Cheese, but I am sadly not a fan of this ""Crispy"" one. They are like mini Mac n Cheese patties, breaded, and deep fried.. Sounds great, but I can't put my finger on why I didn't love 'em. It was a little dry, but I think it was that I didn't like the seasoning in the breading.. IDK. Either way, I wouldn't order it again. (Totally unlike their regular Mac n Cheese bc their regular one--off the kid's menu--is fantastic!) Anyway, I'm a fan of CPK, especially this one in particular.

I'm always a little saddened when personal favorites go away (Miso Shrimp Salad... whyyyyyy???) but I can count on something new and exciting to fill its spot.  CPK always has friendly staff, either because all staff are just trained to love me or the more realistic explanation is that the staff are really, really awesome. This isn't fine dining, this is CPK and what you get is good quality food, good prices, great service and a great time all around.  This is what restaurant dining should be, especially with a place as busy as CPK it is a pleasant surprise to always be treated like you're welcome there.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu?start=320,3.92,3.64,3.616,4.0200000000000005,3.7520000000000002

I think this may be my favorite place to eat....I never leave regretting my decision and you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  My favorite thing about CPK is their consistency...whether you eat it at Ala Moana or Kahala, Hawaii or California, it's ALWAYS good.  How is that possible?  I don't know, but it is. Service is usually pretty good unless you unfortunately are being served by a server who is PMSing and having a bad day but hey, that's rare and even in that case the food still makes up for it. I think the most awesome thing about CPK is their adventure guarantee.  You know how everyone ALWAYS orders the same thing because trying something new could possible result in an order you don't enjoy and then you leave bummed that you spent money on food you didn't enjoy and you're still hungry.  Well fret not because at CPK, they encourage you to order something you've never tried and if you get it and decide that it sucks...send it back and replace it for something you know you'll love!  Don't be a douche though and eat everything and then say you don't like it...that's bad karma and you'll probably get diarrhea for taking advantage of such a wonderful idea.

As most would know, pumpkin flavors or pumpkin related foods are most popular during the fall period of every year...i.e.: pumpkin latte, pumpkin pie, and of course pumpkin cheesecake.  Although cheesecake itself is traditionally sweet, I truly enjoyed my portion of the pumpkin cheesecake today because I felt it was a not too sweet overall.  At times, if a dessert or cheesecake is overly sweet I tend not to finish it entirely (this has happened at the Cheesecake Factory).  The pumpkin cheesecake is a decent portion/size that you can choose to share or keep all to yourself and is accompanied by a generous portion of whip cream as well.  The pumpkin flavor is blended well with a hint of spice, and when combined with the whip cream makes for a wonderful end to a meal.

Sure CPK didn't think I was that awesome, but hopefully since then, I've proven them wrong on some level.

I like sharing a full salad and pizza with my boyfriend, and we usually leave with a full belly. They still offer free bread but you have to make sure to ask for it.

I ordered your cranberry, chicken, walnut focaccia sandwich with artichoke and broccoli soup and hubby had your cobb salad (our go-to salad) with vinaigrette dressing.

Service is usually pretty good unless you unfortunately are being served by a server who is PMSing and having a bad day but hey, that's rare and even in that case the food still makes up for it. I think the most awesome thing about CPK is their adventure guarantee.  You know how everyone ALWAYS orders the same thing because trying something new could possible result in an order you don't enjoy and then you leave bummed that you spent money on food you didn't enjoy and you're still hungry.  Well fret not because at CPK, they encourage you to order something you've never tried and if you get it and decide that it sucks...send it back and replace it for something you know you'll love!  Don't be a douche though and eat everything and then say you don't like it...that's bad karma and you'll probably get diarrhea for taking advantage of such a wonderful idea.

This was when I was in the 12th grade, a Senior in high school and thought to myself ""How can anything else taste better than this?!"" I remember trying to get a job as a hostess, having a group interview and not getting called back. Sure CPK didn't think I was that awesome, but hopefully since then, I've proven them wrong on some level.  As my world view has evolved since the 12th grade, but CPK still remains a solid choice when hitting the mall. It's a place everyone in the family feels comfortable and you can get a damn good salad that eats like a meal. I like sharing a full salad and pizza with my boyfriend, and we usually leave with a full belly. They still offer free bread but you have to make sure to ask for it. This particular location is very busy so during peak hours you can expect to wait a good 30-60 minutes for a table depending on the size of your party. If you've only got two in your party, see if you can grab a seat at the bar as there's less of a wait. If you're ordering take-out you'll still have quite a wait ahead of you so plan wisely and call well before you plan to pick-up.

When you're in Alamoana and you want to treat yourself to something special... go to CPK. The wait can be long in lunch and dinner rush hour (12pm and 6:30pm-8:30pm) but they have some great dishes you can try. First off, it's Alamoana. Parking shouldn't even be an issue unless it's the holiday shopping season. Prices are reasonable. I've never seen an item menu exceed $18 (and it's pretty damn good). You can get some pretty filling stuff for under $9.. such as the infamous Spinach Artichoke Dip. Delicious and calorie filling by the way :0  I love their pasta dishes. Lemon caper picatta chicken, fetticuine alfredo... mmm. As for their salads? How can you not love the Thai Crunch? I'm just drooling thinking about it. The desserts are lovely! The Butter Cake with a whipped cream topping blends into one heavenly experience. Their pizzas can be a hit or miss on my experience but I usually go with the popular BBQ chicken. It's a little small but it's something you can try. Once you step in, the decor just uplifts you.

As most would know, pumpkin flavors or pumpkin related foods are most popular during the fall period of every year...i.e.: pumpkin latte, pumpkin pie, and of course pumpkin cheesecake.  Although cheesecake itself is traditionally sweet, I truly enjoyed my portion of the pumpkin cheesecake today because I felt it was a not too sweet overall.  At times, if a dessert or cheesecake is overly sweet I tend not to finish it entirely (this has happened at the Cheesecake Factory).  The pumpkin cheesecake is a decent portion/size that you can choose to share or keep all to yourself and is accompanied by a generous portion of whip cream as well.  The pumpkin flavor is blended well with a hint of spice, and when combined with the whip cream makes for a wonderful end to a meal.

This stems from my college days where eating pizza is an almost every day occurrence. It doesn't taste horrible to me, but I lack the ""eagerness"" to eat pizza. Thankfully, CPK carries food other than pizza and that's a good thing. Their food is pretty good and prices aren't very high. I've tried their pizza before and although I dislike pizza,  I have to admit, it is delicious. Their BBQ chicken pizza is awesome with cilantro, but alas, it is just pizza, albeit good pizza. The pastas and salads are what I love about them. My favorite has got to be their Chinese chicken salad. Other commendable dishes include their Caesar, original BBQ chicken chopped salad, and asparagus spinach spaghettini.  Service has always been good here.

But today, I was so unhappy with the restaurant that I almost wanted to complain to the manager, which is something I NEVER do.  I was about to rage (it runs in my Korean genes), but I knew that there was no coming back from rage...So my boyfriend calmed me down but I was unhappy throughout my meal and didn't get to enjoy my food at all. Basically, CPK has a new ""wait list"" feature where you can call ahead to be placed on the wait list.  I called at 7:20 and told them I would be there in 15 minutes.  They said they could have me seated around 7:50, which I said was fine.  I get to the counter to check in and she tells me that I'm not on the list...only to find my name scribbled on a piece of scratch paper on the side, NOWHERE near the wait list.  So she apologizes and says she will have us seated immediately and as soon as the next table opens up.  I thank her and go outside to sit.  8:10...and no news.  I go inside and ask when we will be seated and she asks me for my buzzer and when she realizes it didn't buzz, she looks at me like I'm crazy.  So then I explained that they FORGOT to put me on the wait list in the first place, and when they start getting flustered I realize that they totally forgot to put me back on the wait list when I checked in and they messed up the first time.  Then they get SUPER accommodating and have us seated within 5 minutes.  Customers shouldn't have to ""complain"" multiple times to fix the mistakes of the employees.  I'm not one to complain frequently or be rude to people who serve my food.  I understand that mistakes happen and I was cool about it.  When you mess up twice within a 30 minute period, that's not okay.  Do your damn job.  And if you're advertising a new ""wait list"" feature, make sure everyone's on the same page and doing it correctly. I've never had an issue with CPK's food or service before.  I usually love the friendly staff and their food is awesome.  But service is a make it or break it deal for me.  I was very unsatisfied.  If any of you ever decide to utilize their call ahead wait list feature, make sure you verify with them that they're actually going to write your name down.  Because apparently it's not obvious that should be done in the first place?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu?start=220,3.36,3.71,3.744,2.6640000000000006,3.5700000000000003

1043,Michael W.,"Honolulu, United States",104,57,30.0,3.0,2013-06-12,"Christmas shopping at Hawaii's largest and most popular shopping center can be tiring sometimes. So, we decided to have a sit down table service lunch and relax a bit. California Pizza Kitchen was agreed to and was shown to a table not to my liking. I spoke up and it wasn't a problem to be shown another table with a view of the ocean. A plus for good service. Our server, named Love, almost immediately showed up with the menus and asked if we would like anything to drink. A short while later, Love returned with our Iced Tea drinks. After perusing the menu, we decided on the Moroccan Spiced Salad and a Sicilian Thin Crust Pizza. The pizza crust was both crispy and chewy. Just the way we love it! The amount of sauce was just right to give it taste and not make the pie soggy. The toppings were both tasty and sufficient enough to get some in nearly every bite. 4 stars for the pizza! And now for the salad. The Romaine was fresh and crisp, the avocado was ripened perfectly but the beets seemed like it was out of a can. The peanuts were not roasted enough and the dates were an extremely rare topping on the Moroccan Spiced Salad. The amount of dressing tossed with the salad was adequate. However, having been to Morocco, we didn't detect a hint of any Moroccan spices. In fact, the dressing was very bland and was just there to moisten the Romaine Lettuce. A lot of black pepper, Parmesan Cheese and chili flakes finally made the salad palatable. 2 stars for the salad. The ambience was fine and Love provided excellent service. She kept our iced tea glasses filled and our table clean without being obtrusive. 4 stars for ambience and 5 stars for Love's service! I would return again and recommend this establishment to others. But, stay away from the Moroccan Spiced Salad!

My Mom and I waited and waited to place our usual orders of Thai Crunch Salads and some refreshing pink lemonade and iced tea on the side.  We waited for our drinks and bread to arrive and nothing came.  Then finally our salads came and I had noticed that everyone around us had bread at their table, so I asked for bread as well.  In the midst of all the chaos, I observed our waiter drip water multiple times on my daughter's carrier and almost trip on her twice with dirty plates.  I kept apologizing and tucking her further under our table.  I never fidgeted with her once, so she remained in the same spot the whole time.  I only moved her multiple times after he kept running into her.  No other waiter was doing that and he was the very person who told me to put her there.  =( After that experience I haven't been back.  Sadly this was one of my favorite spots to have lunch with my friends while shopping at the Mall.  I always tolerated their consistent wait of fifteen minutes to an hour for a seat, but not anymore.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu?start=220,3.68,3.5,3.724,3.0760000000000005,3.5720000000000005

But today, I was so unhappy with the restaurant that I almost wanted to complain to the manager, which is something I NEVER do.  I was about to rage (it runs in my Korean genes), but I knew that there was no coming back from rage...So my boyfriend calmed me down but I was unhappy throughout my meal and didn't get to enjoy my food at all. Basically, CPK has a new ""wait list"" feature where you can call ahead to be placed on the wait list.  I called at 7:20 and told them I would be there in 15 minutes.  They said they could have me seated around 7:50, which I said was fine.  I get to the counter to check in and she tells me that I'm not on the list...only to find my name scribbled on a piece of scratch paper on the side, NOWHERE near the wait list.  So she apologizes and says she will have us seated immediately and as soon as the next table opens up.  I thank her and go outside to sit.  8:10...and no news.  I go inside and ask when we will be seated and she asks me for my buzzer and when she realizes it didn't buzz, she looks at me like I'm crazy.  So then I explained that they FORGOT to put me on the wait list in the first place, and when they start getting flustered I realize that they totally forgot to put me back on the wait list when I checked in and they messed up the first time.  Then they get SUPER accommodating and have us seated within 5 minutes.  Customers shouldn't have to ""complain"" multiple times to fix the mistakes of the employees.  I'm not one to complain frequently or be rude to people who serve my food.  I understand that mistakes happen and I was cool about it.  When you mess up twice within a 30 minute period, that's not okay.  Do your damn job.  And if you're advertising a new ""wait list"" feature, make sure everyone's on the same page and doing it correctly. I've never had an issue with CPK's food or service before.  I usually love the friendly staff and their food is awesome.  But service is a make it or break it deal for me.  I was very unsatisfied.  If any of you ever decide to utilize their call ahead wait list feature, make sure you verify with them that they're actually going to write your name down.  Because apparently it's not obvious that should be done in the first place?",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu?start=220,3.6,3.47,3.72,3.24,3.5220000000000002

I showed up to my 7:00 reservations at 6:50 only for them to tell me to wait another 60-90 minutes. What is the point in taking reservations if you are not going to have the tables ready in time? Very disorganized. We also asked them to wipe the benches outside because they're wet from the rain and all they do is hand us four napkins to wipe it ourselves. Pretty bad service so far.

This stems from my college days where eating pizza is an almost every day occurrence. It doesn't taste horrible to me, but I lack the ""eagerness"" to eat pizza. Thankfully, CPK carries food other than pizza and that's a good thing. Their food is pretty good and prices aren't very high. I've tried their pizza before and although I dislike pizza,  I have to admit, it is delicious. Their BBQ chicken pizza is awesome with cilantro, but alas, it is just pizza, albeit good pizza. The pastas and salads are what I love about them. My favorite has got to be their Chinese chicken salad. Other commendable dishes include their Caesar, original BBQ chicken chopped salad, and asparagus spinach spaghettini.  Service has always been good here.

334,Michael W.,"Honolulu, HI",104,57,30.0,3.0,2013-12-06,"Christmas shopping at Hawaii's largest and most popular shopping center can be tiring sometimes. So, we decided to have a sit down table service lunch and relax a bit. California Pizza Kitchen was agreed to and was shown to a table not to my liking. I spoke up and it wasn't a problem to be shown another table with a view of the ocean. A plus for good service. Our server, named Love, almost immediately showed up with the menus and asked if we would like anything to drink. A short while later, Love returned with our Iced Tea drinks. After perusing the menu, we decided on the Moroccan Spiced Salad and a Sicilian Thin Crust Pizza. The pizza crust was both crispy and chewy. Just the way we love it! The amount of sauce was just right to give it taste and not make the pie soggy. The toppings were both tasty and sufficient enough to get some in nearly every bite. 4 stars for the pizza! And now for the salad. The Romaine was fresh and crisp, the avocado was ripened perfectly but the beets seemed like it was out of a can. The peanuts were not roasted enough and the dates were an extremely rare topping on the Moroccan Spiced Salad. The amount of dressing tossed with the salad was adequate. However, having been to Morocco, we didn't detect a hint of any Moroccan spices. In fact, the dressing was very bland and was just there to moisten the Romaine Lettuce. A lot of black pepper, Parmesan Cheese and chili flakes finally made the salad palatable. 2 stars for the salad. The ambience was fine and Love provided excellent service. She kept our iced tea glasses filled and our table clean without being obtrusive. 4 stars for ambience and 5 stars for Love's service! I would return again and recommend this establishment to others. But, stay away from the Moroccan Spiced Salad!

My good friend and I got there around 6:20pm last night and was told that it'll be a 10 min wait.  By 7:05pm we were buzzed and lead to our table.  Boy, that was a long ""10 mins"".   We ordered half a plate of the peach salad (gluten free) and it was pretty tasty.  I ordered the mushroom, pepperoni and sausage gluten free pizza and my friend ordered the Thai pizza.  There's only 4 pizzas that are certified gluten free however they can make the other pizzas gluten free but there may be some cross contamination of gluten in the items.  So if you are seriously gluten free, then that is something to consider.   The server was knowledgeable in this area and was concerned when I wanted to add broccoli on my pizza.  I appreciated that he knew what he was talking about and didn't want me to get sick.  I told him that I wasn't going to explode if there was some cross contamination bcs I'm not seriously allergic, I'll just have issues later when I get home. The pizza came out great, I really enjoyed their gluten free crust, the sausage was tasty and there was just the right amount of sauce and cheese.  I was a super happy camper! I am super stoked that CPK has gluten free pizza (I haven't had pizza in MONTHS since going paleo this year and although this isn't paleo, it's alright since I can tolerate a certain amount of dairy and I'm ok with rice flour).  They do not have any gluten free desserts but hopefully they will in the future. So here's some tidbits of CPK, they have this rewards program for ""dough"", every $100 you spend, they give you $5 back and they throw in some free stuff occasionally.  You can sign up on their website but you have to download the app and then let your server know you want to collect your dough rewards when you are at the table. Also, you can buy gift certs from Costco for 20% off - score!  I need to go stock up since I can have their pizza again :) This location is convenient since I live in town and can get some shopping done however it gets quite busy for dinner and the wait can get a little long at times.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu?start=220,3.68,3.61,3.596,3.408,3.6380000000000003

But my boyfriend got a CPK gift card for Christmas, and so here we are. Their pizzas and flatbreads really are delicious. I especially liked the Spicy Chicken Chipotle. But it is a bit of money for thin-crust pizza. I got their Mushroom Sausage, which was a bit of a mistake. While delicious, I felt like it was a waste getting a type of pizza I could get anywhere else for cheaper. The Spicy Chicken Chipotle, on the other hand, is pretty unique and worth getting.

264,Jay P.,"McCully - Moiliili, HI",151,142,3.0,4.0,2014-01-09,"I usually try to avoid CPK because I'm not really a *huge* fan of the food here, but since I just came back from South Korea and only ate Korean food for an entire year, I thought a change in flavor would do me some good. My friends and I were also looking for happy hour specials at other places but we just missed most of them and decided to just eat and drink here. We called ahead of time to ask how long the wait was for a group of four and were told that it would take about half an hour. We placed our names on the waiting list and headed towards the Ala Moana location. All four of us arrived, parked, and walked over to CPK in less than ten minutes and were seated about five minutes after we arrived. Once we sat down and were given our menus, our friendly server asked us if we wanted to start off with anything to drink and if we had any special requests at the time. All four of us ordered a glass of Blue Moon and asked for their complimentary bread (+additional servings). In less than five minutes, our server came back with our drinks and with enough bread for two rounds per person. We all ordered appetizers and our own dinner dishes after our server came back with more complimentary bread. We all shared the Spinach Artichoke Dip and I ordered myself a plate of Pesto Cream Penne with chicken. The Spinach Artichoke Dip is really nothing special; I felt like I could buy the same flavor at Don Quijote or some other supermarket. The Pesto Cream Penne was alright, but I could have sworn that I only counted four pieces of chicken. I paid $3.00 for four pieces of chicken. The portions for everything we ordered were either standard or on the larger side. I even had to ask for a take-out container for the pasta that I left over (which was about half the plate because I ate way too much starch here, whoops). My opinion remains the same about CPK -- I just can't find what some people find so amazing about the food here. I gave this location four stars because our server was friendly and energetic, came back constantly to check up on us, engaged in conversation with us from time to time, and gave us advice about what we should and shouldn't order.

CPK frequently advertises their call-ahead function, where you can call about an hour before your party wants to eat and be added to the waiting list. It is a consolation since they do not take reservations. After hearing about it for some time, I decided to try it. My relatives were in town so we had a large party of 9. Crazy on a Friday night. I called ahead at 6:30pm and said we wanted to come in around 7:30. The hostess seemed confused at the thought of a call ahead and transferred me to her manager, who also had a slight attitude problem. Anywho, an hour to get together a table, no sweat right? Welllllll we waited until after 8:00pm. We kept checking on the table and they said the people at ""our table"" were taking a while to leave. I don't know how restaurants work, so I was understanding but increasingly hangry. I didn't appreciate that they kept making excuses, and the hostesses seemed irritated that they had to accommodate such a large party. The manager eventually offered us drinks, but it was a little too late. When we were finally seated, all of us were a little irked. However, the manager started us off with complimentary appetizers. Honestly for a restaurant that is so busy that they don't need to take reservations, I did not expect such hospitality from the manager. He also came back during dinner to make sure we were doing okay. Our server was very charismatic and accommodating as well. She didn't make a fuss at all when we asked to split the check three ways. Overall, I left appreciative of the management who took accountability for the mishap and did whatever possible to remedy the situation. I wouldn't rely on call ahead in the future though.

476,McKenna H.,"Honolulu, HI",0,1,,2.0,2014-02-10,"CPK has always been a favorite destination of mine and my friends.  I went around 4'o'clock and there was no wait.  I ordered the same thing I get almost every time I come here, the California Club Sandwich w/ chicken on the herb-cheese bread.  Upon receiving my order, I noticed that there were hair-like fibers on top of my sandwich.   This same scenario happened to me about two or three weeks ago at this exact location.  At the time, I told my waiter (I think his name was Chase) and he apologized about it and called his manager over.  I'm not sure what her name was, but she was very nice.  She saw that there were these hairs on the bread and took the meal off our check and even gave us a dessert for free.   Today when I had told my waitress, she said that she would talk about it with her manager and even the cooks in the back.  She came back to tell us that they use a towel to hold the hot bread while cutting it.  I was a little grossed out about this (Who knows how many times they have washed that towel, or even if people's sweaty hands have touched the towel that touches my bread).  She offered to get us another meal (Not on the house), but I refused politely because I was very hungry so I didn't eat the portion of the sandwich that had the hair on it.  She told me that she would get her manager to come over, but after 5-10 minutes, he wasn't coming so I had to remind her to get her manager.  When he came by the table, I had recognized him from the last time I was there (The first scenario about two/three weeks ago).  In that previous scenario, I remember him only because he was being rude to my friend and I when I nicely asked him what he had just served to the table next to us and what was in the dish.   So when he had showed up at our table this time, he asked me where the hair-like fiber was and I showed him.  When my friend told him ""That is basically like eating parts of a towel"", he said ""No, it isn't basically eating parts of a towel."" He then proceeded to tell us that he could ""barely see it"" (Regardless if he could barely see it, it was still there which still made it gross!) The whole time speaking to us, he was being rude once again.  He offered to get us another meal (Again, not for free) but we refused.  My friend and I were both very irritated.   After leaving our table, we got looks from the other workers as my friend and I were talking about the situation.  Even our waitress and her shadow seemed very awkward talking to us after everything had happened.  We saw the manager speaking to the head cook (I'm assuming?) right near us which I thought was rude, 1) To be speaking about the matter right by our table.  I didn't get his name (which I should have) but he had short black hair and a beard/mustache.   One reason why I assumed he was being rude was because we are teenagers.  Just because we're teenagers doesn't mean people can treat us like that.  We're customers regardless, and I'm sure that the manager wouldn't speak rudely to other, older customers.   After this incident happening twice, I am never coming to this CPK location again.  The towel thing disgusted me but so did the service of the manager and the other waiters/waitresses.  I have eaten the California Club Sandwich probably twenty or thirty times before, and now that I think about it, there were probably pieces of towels on those sandwiches too.  I hope the manager and the other waiters and waitresses see this so they know what not to do.  If I ever do come to this CPK again and it happens once more, I will be very disappointed and will have to speak with the other managers about who they promote and who they hire.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu?start=540,3.84,3.69,3.64,3.0800000000000005,3.75

There are however days in which I am hit with a particular craving for something new and exciting. On a recent trip to Oahu, I experienced this craving while shopping at the Ala Moana mall. After some time spent wandering and contemplating, I decided on the popular and well-known California Pizza Kitchen.  While I had eaten their frozen pizzas from the local supermarket before, I was intrigued with the idea of trying their freshly made ones. Upon entering the restaurant, my eyes swept the room while I gauged the surrounding moods. Although quite crowded and with every table occupied, the atmosphere was light and happy, with families laughing and enjoying their food. The large glass windows further fostered the lighthearted ambience of the restaurant, since they let in all the natural light while also providing a great view of the ocean.  As for the numerous amounts of diners, this was to be expected of a prominent restaurant located in one of Honolulu's main hubs. Surprisingly however, the wait time was much shorter than they had originally stated. In retrospect, this was most likely due to the quality service. One of the friendliest waiters I had ever met brought out every order in a timely fashion, and he always made sure to check up on us when he passed by. Patrons also got the sense of really being able to trust the cooks, since there was no division of the kitchen from the dining area, and they made the pizzas in a fantastic brick oven right in front of you.  Moving on to the food, the most concise yet all-encompassing way to describe it was delectable! I am known to be quite the picky eater, especially when it comes to salad. However I had absolutely no complaints about their Caesar salad. In fact, it was probably the best restaurant salad I had ever been served! The presentation of the soup and pizza was quite impressive, and the complimentary rosemary bread and olive oil dipping sauce was an added bonus! Pizza happens to be one of my favorite foods, and just thinking back on that meal makes my mouth water.  I would highly recommend dining at the California Pizza Kitchen to families, or to groups of friends on an outing. Not only are the food and service of excellent quality, but also the pricing is unexpectedly reasonable for the generous portions that we had been served. Convenience-wise, I would not suggest making a special trip to go to the particular California Pizza Kitchen that I had dined at, if you are just planning on going out for a meal. I say this with good intentions, seeing as you would have to first find parking at the mall, then maneuver through the crowded walkways until you could find an escalator to take you to the next floor, and repeating this until you get to the fourth floor where the restaurants are located.

First of all, when I checked in on Yelp, I noticed that if you sign up for their rewards program, you get a free ""small plate"". LOVE free stuff! Seriously sign up for the ""pizza dough"" rewards card!  The server promptly came to our table and was SO helpful in telling us how to download the apps on our phones to redeem the rewards (my friend also got a free dessert on her card!) and that he would split our checks since normally only one card can be used. Awesome! For the small plate, we got the Crispy Mac N Cheese (reg $4.95 but we got it for free) - YUM. It came with 3 balls of fried, breaded, mac n cheese. Not oily at all, perfectly crisp with a melty inside. Spinach Artichoke Dip ($10.95) - um, dah, you need to get this. Who doesn't order this when coming to CPK? Warm, melted cheese, spinach, artichoke... yeah. I ordered the Mushroom Pepperoni Sausage Pizza (minus the sausage cause I'm not a fan of tubed meat $16-something?? because i added TRUFFLE OIL which was an additional $1.50) - besides what toppings is obviously on this pizza, it had fresh basil mmm. holy hannah, I LOVE truffle oil and so glad they offer it as an add-on for only $1.50. Other pizza places I've gone to charge up to $3 for this. yikes. Their pizza was surprisingly delish! I used to hate (really, hate) their pizzas before but I feel like they've really improved and I totally would come back!! Our server was so helpful and attentive.  The only downside is it gets bananas-busy! Gross - I don't really like the feeling of being rushed out of a restaurant or waiting 30+minutes for a table unless the place is to-die-for.

I told her that we were a party of 6 with 1 wheelchair patron and a child (that didn't need any high chair or booster). She noted that they were slow and that our party will be taken care of, but would note that we were on our way. We arrive, and the host checks us in and says she had the table set up already for us.

SERVER EXPERIENCE: Our server was a young lady who was polite. Proper server etiquette is to accommodate the children first as they are they hardest customers to please. When she dropped off all the adult drinks she did mention, ""I will be right back with that chocolate milk, I will make it from scratch."" Which I believe that was nice to mention, but still ....  We were still waiting for the rest of our party to arrive, and when they did we kind of sat there for what felt like 15 minutes before the waiter returned.

The male who delivered our drinks was the one who took over service. The original girl passed by us and then changed into her regular clothes and then just said thank you and left. Proper etiquette would be to introduce the server that will be taking over so that there is no confusion.  My cousin actually ordered a lemon drop, but didn't realize that ordering it blended wouldn't be the best option. As the server, you should know your menu inside and out including the drink menu. The objective is to up-sale and keep the patron satisfied with minimal returns. Had she asked my cousin what is her taste preference was she could have either suggested a different drink or mentioned that ordering it blended would not provide her with optimal taste.

231,Chelsey C.,"Honolulu, HI",159,212,177.0,3.0,2014-08-02,"This review was going to be another 1-star, but CPK management and an awesome server saved the day! CPK frequently advertises their call-ahead function, where you can call about an hour before your party wants to eat and be added to the waiting list. It is a consolation since they do not take reservations. After hearing about it for some time, I decided to try it. My relatives were in town so we had a large party of 9. Crazy on a Friday night. I called ahead at 6:30pm and said we wanted to come in around 7:30. The hostess seemed confused at the thought of a call ahead and transferred me to her manager, who also had a slight attitude problem. Anywho, an hour to get together a table, no sweat right? Welllllll we waited until after 8:00pm. We kept checking on the table and they said the people at ""our table"" were taking a while to leave. I don't know how restaurants work, so I was understanding but increasingly hangry. I didn't appreciate that they kept making excuses, and the hostesses seemed irritated that they had to accommodate such a large party. The manager eventually offered us drinks, but it was a little too late. When we were finally seated, all of us were a little irked. However, the manager started us off with complimentary appetizers. Honestly for a restaurant that is so busy that they don't need to take reservations, I did not expect such hospitality from the manager. He also came back during dinner to make sure we were doing okay. Our server was very charismatic and accommodating as well. She didn't make a fuss at all when we asked to split the check three ways. Overall, I left appreciative of the management who took accountability for the mishap and did whatever possible to remedy the situation. I wouldn't rely on call ahead in the future though. Just expect a wait and enjoy some shopping.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu?start=260,3.6,3.73,3.584,3.692,3.6780000000000004

The manager came and he handled it very well.  He apologized and it was done very well.  I recognize him as someone from the industry for a long time and he was very professional and courteous.  I give him 5 stars for how he handled it.  We were finally seated about 15 minutes later and were given comp appetizers from the manager.  That was nice but the table was cramped and pushed up against the window so very uncomfortable for the people with their backs to the window. The food was 4 stars and the service was 5 stars - I forgot her name but she was excellent.  But all in all the evening was pretty much ruined because we could not go shopping and it took us 3.5 hours to have dinner of which only one hour was actually sitting down and eating.

Now this time, when we told our waitress she said she would talk to her manager and the kitchen staff. She came back from speaking with someone in the kitchen, to tell us that they use towels to hold the bread when they cut it (Gross, what if their kitchen staff uses their sweaty hands to cut the bread?! Their sweat would seep through these towels and contaminate our meal.) the manager didn't approach us until we asked our server where he was.

My friends and I were also looking for happy hour specials at other places but we just missed most of them and decided to just eat and drink here. We called ahead of time to ask how long the wait was for a group of four and were told that it would take about half an hour. We placed our names on the waiting list and headed towards the Ala Moana location. All four of us arrived, parked, and walked over to CPK in less than ten minutes and were seated about five minutes after we arrived. Once we sat down and were given our menus, our friendly server asked us if we wanted to start off with anything to drink and if we had any special requests at the time. All four of us ordered a glass of Blue Moon and asked for their complimentary bread (+additional servings). In less than five minutes, our server came back with our drinks and with enough bread for two rounds per person. We all ordered appetizers and our own dinner dishes after our server came back with more complimentary bread. We all shared the Spinach Artichoke Dip and I ordered myself a plate of Pesto Cream Penne with chicken. The Spinach Artichoke Dip is really nothing special; I felt like I could buy the same flavor at Don Quijote or some other supermarket. The Pesto Cream Penne was alright, but I could have sworn that I only counted four pieces of chicken. I paid $3.00 for four pieces of chicken. The portions for everything we ordered were either standard or on the larger side. I even had to ask for a take-out container for the pasta that I left over (which was about half the plate because I ate way too much starch here, whoops). My opinion remains the same about CPK -- I just can't find what some people find so amazing about the food here. I gave this location four stars because our server was friendly and energetic, came back constantly to check up on us, engaged in conversation with us from time to time, and gave us advice about what we should and shouldn't order.

You often have numerous issues, food takes too long, can't split the check, etc etc etc. Believe me, I've stopped eating at certain establishments because of how they handled our group.  That didn't happen here at CPK! We were warmly greeted by several staff upon our arrival. I was told they don't take reservations but we could call in our orders before arriving. 18 of us came in at lunch, were promptly seated near a window and given drink menus by our server, Kona. He was an awesome server who seemed to really enjoy what he was doing, always making sure drinks were filled and orders were put in quickly. Needed more sauce? No problem. More bread? It's coming right out. Want a refill on your drink? He already had it in hand. Kona restored my faith in CPK as a place to eat at...and I'm sad to know his last day was today. Hopefully the staff can keep up the good work and service that he showed today.  As soon as our drinks were brought out, the food was being placed in front of us. The servers all seemed to help each other out and there wasn't very long of a wait for everyone to get their dishes. I ordered the half sized portion of roasted veggie salad. I originally wanted it with chicken but couldn't justify paying $4 extra bringing my half portion salad to cost $15. Overall, the salad was tasty and quite filling for a half portion.  The only reason I can't give CPK 5 stars was the prices seem a little high for me and the wait for our bill was a bit long.

1165,McKenna H.,"Honolulu, United States",0,1,,2.0,2014-10-02,"CPK has always been a favorite destination of mine and my friends.  I went around 4'o'clock and there was no wait.  I ordered the same thing I get almost every time I come here, the California Club Sandwich w/ chicken on the herb-cheese bread.  Upon receiving my order, I noticed that there were hair-like fibers on top of my sandwich.   This same scenario happened to me about two or three weeks ago at this exact location.  At the time, I told my waiter (I think his name was Chase) and he apologized about it and called his manager over.  I'm not sure what her name was, but she was very nice.  She saw that there were these hairs on the bread and took the meal off our check and even gave us a dessert for free.   Today when I had told my waitress, she said that she would talk about it with her manager and even the cooks in the back.  She came back to tell us that they use a towel to hold the hot bread while cutting it.  I was a little grossed out about this (Who knows how many times they have washed that towel, or even if people's sweaty hands have touched the towel that touches my bread).  She offered to get us another meal (Not on the house), but I refused politely because I was very hungry so I didn't eat the portion of the sandwich that had the hair on it.  She told me that she would get her manager to come over, but after 5-10 minutes, he wasn't coming so I had to remind her to get her manager.  When he came by the table, I had recognized him from the last time I was there (The first scenario about two/three weeks ago).  In that previous scenario, I remember him only because he was being rude to my friend and I when I nicely asked him what he had just served to the table next to us and what was in the dish.   So when he had showed up at our table this time, he asked me where the hair-like fiber was and I showed him.  When my friend told him ""That is basically like eating parts of a towel"", he said ""No, it isn't basically eating parts of a towel."" He then proceeded to tell us that he could ""barely see it"" (Regardless if he could barely see it, it was still there which still made it gross!) The whole time speaking to us, he was being rude once again.  He offered to get us another meal (Again, not for free) but we refused.  My friend and I were both very irritated.   After leaving our table, we got looks from the other workers as my friend and I were talking about the situation.  Even our waitress and her shadow seemed very awkward talking to us after everything had happened.  We saw the manager speaking to the head cook (I'm assuming?) right near us which I thought was rude, 1) To be speaking about the matter right by our table.  I didn't get his name (which I should have) but he had short black hair and a beard/mustache.   One reason why I assumed he was being rude was because we are teenagers.  Just because we're teenagers doesn't mean people can treat us like that.  We're customers regardless, and I'm sure that the manager wouldn't speak rudely to other, older customers.   After this incident happening twice, I am never coming to this CPK location again.  The towel thing disgusted me but so did the service of the manager and the other waiters/waitresses.  I have eaten the California Club Sandwich probably twenty or thirty times before, and now that I think about it, there were probably pieces of towels on those sandwiches too.  I hope the manager and the other waiters and waitresses see this so they know what not to do.  If I ever do come to this CPK again and it happens once more, I will be very disappointed and will have to speak with the other managers about who they promote and who they hire.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu?start=540,4.2,3.83,3.656,2.8880000000000003,3.978

The manager came and he handled it very well.  He apologized and it was done very well.  I recognize him as someone from the industry for a long time and he was very professional and courteous.  I give him 5 stars for how he handled it.  We were finally seated about 15 minutes later and were given comp appetizers from the manager.  That was nice but the table was cramped and pushed up against the window so very uncomfortable for the people with their backs to the window. The food was 4 stars and the service was 5 stars - I forgot her name but she was excellent.  But all in all the evening was pretty much ruined because we could not go shopping and it took us 3.5 hours to have dinner of which only one hour was actually sitting down and eating.

You often have numerous issues, food takes too long, can't split the check, etc etc etc. Believe me, I've stopped eating at certain establishments because of how they handled our group.  That didn't happen here at CPK! We were warmly greeted by several staff upon our arrival. I was told they don't take reservations but we could call in our orders before arriving. 18 of us came in at lunch, were promptly seated near a window and given drink menus by our server, Kona. He was an awesome server who seemed to really enjoy what he was doing, always making sure drinks were filled and orders were put in quickly. Needed more sauce? No problem. More bread? It's coming right out. Want a refill on your drink? He already had it in hand. Kona restored my faith in CPK as a place to eat at...and I'm sad to know his last day was today. Hopefully the staff can keep up the good work and service that he showed today.  As soon as our drinks were brought out, the food was being placed in front of us. The servers all seemed to help each other out and there wasn't very long of a wait for everyone to get their dishes. I ordered the half sized portion of roasted veggie salad. I originally wanted it with chicken but couldn't justify paying $4 extra bringing my half portion salad to cost $15. Overall, the salad was tasty and quite filling for a half portion.  The only reason I can't give CPK 5 stars was the prices seem a little high for me and the wait for our bill was a bit long. I think they forgot about me for a while as I was the last one to receive my bill only after we pointed out that I didn't receive it.  Overall, I wouldn't mind coming here again and hope that they can maintain their level of service as it was very impressive :)",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu?start=120,4.36,3.81,3.664,3.184,4.03

Lunch time is usually not bad because it's not really busy, but dinner time is horrible! You can't make any reservations as well, so you're pretty much lucky, or stuck with waiting. If you're stuck, I recommend (if you are of age) to just kill some time at Mai Tais next door.  Over the years there has been many changes with CPKs menu. One major change (which I dislike very much) is the what they do with their Wild Mushroom pizza!!! I spoke with multiple servers on different occasions if I could have the pizza cooked how it ""used to be"". Sometimes the servers are useless and say they can't because they are either lazy, or the kitchen is lazy. On one occasion I spoke with the main manager and he explained that they are going on a ""healthier"" route with some of the pizzas, so the mushrooms on the Wild Mushroom pizza is not sautéed anymore and are raw and fresh along with the other vegetables.

First of all, when I checked in on Yelp, I noticed that if you sign up for their rewards program, you get a free ""small plate"". LOVE free stuff! Seriously sign up for the ""pizza dough"" rewards card!  The server promptly came to our table and was SO helpful in telling us how to download the apps on our phones to redeem the rewards (my friend also got a free dessert on her card!) and that he would split our checks since normally only one card can be used. Awesome! For the small plate, we got the Crispy Mac N Cheese (reg $4.95 but we got it for free) - YUM. It came with 3 balls of fried, breaded, mac n cheese. Not oily at all, perfectly crisp with a melty inside. Spinach Artichoke Dip ($10.95) - um, dah, you need to get this. Who doesn't order this when coming to CPK? Warm, melted cheese, spinach, artichoke... yeah. I ordered the Mushroom Pepperoni Sausage Pizza (minus the sausage cause I'm not a fan of tubed meat $16-something?? because i added TRUFFLE OIL which was an additional $1.50) - besides what toppings is obviously on this pizza, it had fresh basil mmm. holy hannah, I LOVE truffle oil and so glad they offer it as an add-on for only $1.50.

We come to this location quite often, and even some of the staff recognizes us. Today, when my friend and I came for lunch, we both ordered the California Club Sandwich with the herb/cheese bread. Upon receiving our order, my friend noticed that there were fiber-like hairs on top of her sandwich.  This happened to her last time as well. When that happened, our waiter told his manager and she came by our table, and was being very nice and offered to take it off our check and even gave us a free dessert.  Now this time, when we told our waitress she said she would talk to her manager and the kitchen staff. She came back from speaking with someone in the kitchen, to tell us that they use towels to hold the bread when they cut it (Gross, what if their kitchen staff uses their sweaty hands to cut the bread?! Their sweat would seep through these towels and contaminate our meal.) the manager didn't approach us until we asked our server where he was. This time, a male manager came by, and was being rude, telling us we ""weren't technically eating towel"" and how he could barely even see it (it was still there and it was still gross regardless if he could ""see it"" or not).

As we all know, CPK doesn't take reservations so it was definitely a risky dinner choice for such a large group. However, we gambled and we won so woohoo! So how did we do it? The secret is that you can call one hour ahead and get put on the wait list. The person who answered the phone was super surprised when he heard how many were in the party but quickly recovered and said he would see us soon. So I showed up a 10 minutes before 5pm, checked in with the front staff, and waited for the rest of the group to show up. A long table was all set up and waiting for us so that was awesome. A true test of how well-run a restaurant is, is how well they handle large groups, and I have to say CPK handled us like a pro! We got our drinks in no time at all and I swear our food arrived less than 15 minutes after we had all ordered. Considering how much we all ordered, I was quite impressed. Our drinks were frequently refilled and our waiter was never without a smile. Major props to our waiter, Maikai and the rest of the staff!!! Our group split into small groups to make it easier to order. My small group ordered the shaved mushroom and spinach flatbread, original BBQ chicken chopped salad, wild mushroom pizza on honey wheat dough, and the Sicilian (already on thin crust). Everything was so tasty and it was enough for five of us. My favorite was the Sicilian--this pizza burst with flavor and was so darn delicious. We substituted chicken for salami at no extra cost. I would totally get this again next time I dine at CPK. If you are not a Pizza Dough Rewards member yet, you should sign up!

111,Elliot O.,"Honolulu, HI",106,44,77.0,5.0,2015-02-06,"My friends think CPK is my favorite restaurant because I eat here often, but I don't play favorites. And I don't think I eat here that often! To me, CPK is just a last resort because I like their food and I know I won't be disappointed.  I know some people give less stars because they don't like waiting to be seated but I don't think that should be a huge factor (unless your food takes long). Yes, there is almost ALWAYS a wait at any CPK but it's actually not that long of a wait. I would say the wait is about 10~20 minutes average.  When I go to CPK I usually go for the pizzas because 'California PIZZA Kitchen'. I've tried several of their pastas and it's just alright to me. Their pastas are pretty dry. I like my pastas saucey (if that's even a word).  If you want to start with appetizers, you must must must order the Avocado Club Egg Rolls. There are 3 rolls cut in halves so 6 pieces! The rolls are filled with avocado, chicken, tomato, cheese and bacon. They serve it with ranch and ranchito (tastes like chipotle) sauce. I prefer the ranchito over ranch. And I think everyone knows the classic Spinach Artichoke Dip.  For pizzas, I usually order 'The Works' which is basically a supreme pizza. But since you can get that pretty much anywhere else, I would recommend ordering something that's exclusive at CPK. During my last visit here, I ordered the 'White Pizza' with bacon. Just a heads up, this pizza does not have sauce. Instead, it has mozzarella, ricotta, parmesan, pecorino romano, spinach and roasted garlic. I miss their Roasted Garlic Chicken Pizza so this is a good alternative to it.  Despite being busy, the service is prompt and attentive. You should also download the CPK Dough Rewards App on your phone. Every $100 you spend, you get $5 off your next visit! I recently used my $5 and I get another $5 off my next visit!

Our server, Kirtus, was friendly, energetic and efficient.  I must congratulate him on having such a great memory as he effortlessly took our beverage and food orders without writing it down and delivering our food correctly. I also have to give credit to the kitchen and pantry for pacing the preparation of our meal. We ordered our usual California Cobb Salad, a hand-tossed White Pizza (mozzarella, pecorino, ricotta, Parmesan, Romano with sautéed garlic and spinach) with crisp bacon, iced teas and their featured strawberry shortcake.  Everything was served at peak temperature and the generous flavorful portions were consistent with the other CPK restaurants.   Our bill would have been closer to $50 for the two of us but with the Pizza Dough reward and promotion applied, we paid somewhere around $30.  We received top-notch service, delicious food and a gorgeous view while dining at this location.  I'm glad that I am a Pizza Dough member...why aren't you?",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu?start=80,3.56,3.68,3.712,3.8240000000000003,3.6320000000000006

So far, on our vaca this week, CPK has had the best service and didn't screw anything up. We all shared spinach dip, avocado bacon egg rolls (YUM!) and chicken ginger wontons (best out of the 3 appetizers). The frozen mango lemonade was tasty (but pricey at $4.19!) and I got a strawberry drink thingie. My friend got iced tea with free refills. For entrees we got thai pizza, thai salad (full with avocado) and full Caesar salad. Oh, their bread with the pesto Olive oil thingie is to die for. I think it comes with the meal, as we kept asking for refills and they didn't say there was a charge. Dessert was the chocolate cake and velvet cake (chocolate was better). All that was $110 for 3 people. Not an inexpensive meal, but for the amount of food we got, and it was prepared well, we were satisfied. Service was great at this CPK. Tip: ask for the bread and olive oil thingie to go if you have leftovers. We did and we had lunch at our hotel the next day.

As we all know, CPK doesn't take reservations so it was definitely a risky dinner choice for such a large group. However, we gambled and we won so woohoo! So how did we do it? The secret is that you can call one hour ahead and get put on the wait list. The person who answered the phone was super surprised when he heard how many were in the party but quickly recovered and said he would see us soon. So I showed up a 10 minutes before 5pm, checked in with the front staff, and waited for the rest of the group to show up. A long table was all set up and waiting for us so that was awesome. A true test of how well-run a restaurant is, is how well they handle large groups, and I have to say CPK handled us like a pro! We got our drinks in no time at all and I swear our food arrived less than 15 minutes after we had all ordered. Considering how much we all ordered, I was quite impressed. Our drinks were frequently refilled and our waiter was never without a smile. Major props to our waiter, Maikai and the rest of the staff!!! Our group split into small groups to make it easier to order. My small group ordered the shaved mushroom and spinach flatbread, original BBQ chicken chopped salad, wild mushroom pizza on honey wheat dough, and the Sicilian (already on thin crust). Everything was so tasty and it was enough for five of us. My favorite was the Sicilian--this pizza burst with flavor and was so darn delicious. We substituted chicken for salami at no extra cost. I would totally get this again next time I dine at CPK. If you are not a Pizza Dough Rewards member yet, you should sign up!

780,Elliot O.,"Honolulu, United States",106,44,77.0,5.0,2015-06-02,"My friends think CPK is my favorite restaurant because I eat here often, but I don't play favorites. And I don't think I eat here that often! To me, CPK is just a last resort because I like their food and I know I won't be disappointed.  I know some people give less stars because they don't like waiting to be seated but I don't think that should be a huge factor (unless your food takes long). Yes, there is almost ALWAYS a wait at any CPK but it's actually not that long of a wait. I would say the wait is about 10~20 minutes average.  When I go to CPK I usually go for the pizzas because 'California PIZZA Kitchen'. I've tried several of their pastas and it's just alright to me. Their pastas are pretty dry. I like my pastas saucey (if that's even a word).  If you want to start with appetizers, you must must must order the Avocado Club Egg Rolls. There are 3 rolls cut in halves so 6 pieces! The rolls are filled with avocado, chicken, tomato, cheese and bacon. They serve it with ranch and ranchito (tastes like chipotle) sauce. I prefer the ranchito over ranch. And I think everyone knows the classic Spinach Artichoke Dip.  For pizzas, I usually order 'The Works' which is basically a supreme pizza. But since you can get that pretty much anywhere else, I would recommend ordering something that's exclusive at CPK. During my last visit here, I ordered the 'White Pizza' with bacon. Just a heads up, this pizza does not have sauce. Instead, it has mozzarella, ricotta, parmesan, pecorino romano, spinach and roasted garlic. I miss their Roasted Garlic Chicken Pizza so this is a good alternative to it.  Despite being busy, the service is prompt and attentive. You should also download the CPK Dough Rewards App on your phone. Every $100 you spend, you get $5 off your next visit! I recently used my $5 and I get another $5 off my next visit!

I always get a hello. I always get a good bye AND have a nice day. And I always leave happy.  I live in Waikiki so it's the same distance to the one down the strip or inside the mall but either way I just want that pizza! I ordered the pepperoni, sausage, and mushroom and added the olives. It was just the right amount of everything. My friend had the California Club pizza but he's a bit more of picky eater than I am so he picked off most of the arugula and the avocado. I don't really think he ordered the right thing for himself so he didn't finish it. Our waitress was so friendly. She emitted friendly particles. My expectations of servers are always low and she was like the epitome of how all servers should be. Am I being dramatic? If I were it would only be because she was so awesome. Her name is Sarah, btw.  Last time I was there, we got to sit by the kitchen and see all pizzas come out. It's cool to look at especially with all the pizza boxes right next to it neatly aligned. I wish they delivered. I really do. I wouldn't order delivery from anywhere else if they delivered. My fridge would only be CPK pizza. My husband would be so mad!

I have never had a problem with regardless of which grouping of our family is there for a meal. Most of the time, the servers will take my kids orders first so they can get their food faster. That's excellent customer service, IMHO. The food is not anything stellar, but it is dependable. You want pizza? You can get a decent pizza with a variety of topping combinations. I used to live in NJ when I was growing up. My family bought pizza from a little old Sicilian man who had his shop down the street. I've been to Rome where the pizza crust is made so thin you can eat a whole pie on your own without thinking much about it. CPK pizza is pretty good for being a chain restaurant. I love the salads though. They are my whole reason for eating here. Italian Chopped. Roasted Veggie. California Cobb. Chinese Chicken. They are so good! I'd get one every day if I could. There are two things about this location that bother me. First, if you come at a peak time you might as well walk right on past. We came for lunch once and the wait for a table was 45 minutes. Nope. Second, it's loud. I guess it's just the acoustics of the restaurant itself.

This was the first CPK I ever ate at and in recent years, I have not been paying it enough visits.  This Ala Moana branch is BUSY.  It is CROWDED.  Account for waiting time!  The hosts are friendly, though, but unfortunately, reservations are not accepted.  As others have mentioned, waits can be anywhere from 20-60 minutes.   I came here for one of my birthday dinners this week (as it's the big 3-0, I decided to bring my parents out for something different, aka non-Asian).  The wait was only about 10 minutes since I made my boyfellow go early and put down his name. This time, we only ordered (between the 4 of us): wild mushroom pizza (5/5), california veggie pizza (3.5/5), chicken Caesar salad (4.5/5), and the two in a bowl soup (4/5).  My parents don't drink room temperature or cold water so I asked for hot water and the server nicely accommodated them. Other things over the years: Spinach dip (5/5) Yummy in the tummy... Margherita thin crust pizza (4/5) Chinese Chicken salad (5/5) YUM!!!!

Not saying that it's downright the best pizza EVER, but with it's popularity and variety over the years, it's something everyone has tried by now. FIrst off, the wait. You KNOW there's going to be a wait everytime you go to CPK. It's not because this place is small or the service is slow, it's because its just that popular. But rememebr popularity isn't everything in a place. Being conveniently located on the 4th floor of Ala Moana, means there's a lot to do to kill time while waiting. And just FYI, we went to Longs on the OPPOSITE side of the mall and was able to get paged when it was our time to be seated. Atmosphere wise, there's always going to be a lot of people and this central location. There was maybe 2 tables with babies crying, 3 with little kids, and at least 2 happy birthdays (that the kids on the other table all sang along too as well). It is possible to set this place up for a date, but it won't seem like any special and seems the ambiance is more for a casual audience. The service is accommodating, and there hardly is a moment when my glass is empty. The food though, I would say is a hit or miss. Now i've been here a lot of times and not jus tmany of their different pizza's but also their side specials, chips, etc. Some I can say is just alright, meaning ok i'll put it in my stomach now because i'm hungry. While the other dishes are yes this brings out the flavor in the pizza im looking for. Dessert has changed over the years and I got chocolate soufflé cake ala mode, but open placing the plate on the table, the ice cream was already melted! The taste of it was still grand enough for my mouth to be satisfied and remember that it was treated well that night.

353,Mike N.,"Honolulu, HI",247,3,18.0,4.0,2015-06-28,"If you know Pizza, you know CPK. Not saying that it's downright the best pizza EVER, but with it's popularity and variety over the years, it's something everyone has tried by now. FIrst off, the wait. You KNOW there's going to be a wait everytime you go to CPK. It's not because this place is small or the service is slow, it's because its just that popular. But rememebr popularity isn't everything in a place. Being conveniently located on the 4th floor of Ala Moana, means there's a lot to do to kill time while waiting. And just FYI, we went to Longs on the OPPOSITE side of the mall and was able to get paged when it was our time to be seated. Atmosphere wise, there's always going to be a lot of people and this central location. There was maybe 2 tables with babies crying, 3 with little kids, and at least 2 happy birthdays (that the kids on the other table all sang along too as well). It is possible to set this place up for a date, but it won't seem like any special and seems the ambiance is more for a casual audience. The service is accommodating, and there hardly is a moment when my glass is empty. The food though, I would say is a hit or miss. Now i've been here a lot of times and not jus tmany of their different pizza's but also their side specials, chips, etc. Some I can say is just alright, meaning ok i'll put it in my stomach now because i'm hungry. While the other dishes are yes this brings out the flavor in the pizza im looking for. Dessert has changed over the years and I got chocolate soufflé cake ala mode, but open placing the plate on the table, the ice cream was already melted! The taste of it was still grand enough for my mouth to be satisfied and remember that it was treated well that night.

We were handed a pager with flashy lights and we sat on one of the benches outside.  Thank goodness for modern technology! While we waited, we spent a lot of time on our phones. I got to catch up on my email and social media, but that's another story. After about 50 minutes our pager went off and we went inside. Once we got seated, the service was fast and excellent. We ordered our drinks and a short time later the waitress, Brooke, came back and tried to take our order. Some of us weren't there because my nephew needed some fresh air. The waitress was totally fine with coming back later.  The waitress came back to our table as soon as my nephew and our friend came back! I was impressed that she was ""on it"" and we did not have to search or wait for her. Our orders were taken and delivered to the kitchen. The food took some time to prepare, but it was understandable because the restaurant was completely full. There were many orders in front of ours.   Our food arrived and I was happy with the food that I received. I just had to order a pizza since this place is called California Pizza Kitchen. They got to have awesome pizza right? I ordered a Meat Cravers thin crust pizza. It features Italian sausage, pepperoni, applewood smoked ham, spicy Capicola ham, and salami. It was delicious!  I only ate half of my pizza because I'm on a diet. The waitress quickly boxed up the remainder of my pizza, delivered the check, and we were out of there quickly. She also stayed on top of our drink refills. I can easily see why this place is so popular!

I used to live in NJ when I was growing up. My family bought pizza from a little old Sicilian man who had his shop down the street. I've been to Rome where the pizza crust is made so thin you can eat a whole pie on your own without thinking much about it. CPK pizza is pretty good for being a chain restaurant. I love the salads though. They are my whole reason for eating here. Italian Chopped. Roasted Veggie. California Cobb. Chinese Chicken. They are so good! I'd get one every day if I could. There are two things about this location that bother me. First, if you come at a peak time you might as well walk right on past. We came for lunch once and the wait for a table was 45 minutes. Nope. Second, it's loud. I guess it's just the acoustics of the restaurant itself.

Food items are pretty consistent every time and I never ran out of iced tea. I feel as though the wait staff has been getting better and better.  It seems as though they have gotten friendlier over the years and more attentive.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu?start=120,4.0,3.95,3.828,3.024,3.97

A step above the rest, beyond the realm of delivery pizzas. I enjoy the atmosphere in the Ala Moana location. It's always busy, especially on weekends. They also have quite the variety of pizza to choose from. Some are well known and loved by all, others are unique and original. I been here a few times before. It's a great place for a date or if you're with a group of friends. I would have given CPK 5 stars but the service can be hit and miss in my opinion. In the most recent time that I have been here, our first server seemed tired and annoyed, devoid of energy. Granted we did arrive 30 minutes before closing but we couldn't help it. She passed us on to another waitress for whatever reason and she continued to help other tables. Our next waitress was great, she was lively, smiled a lot and brought us everything we needed. We could feel her energy. I could tell she cared. I would definitely go here again in the future. This is a great restaurant with a great atmosphere, and quality food.

753,Jennifer L.,"Honolulu, United States",163,164,51.0,4.0,2015-09-06,"Let me give you a quick run down of how I grew up.  I grew up eating Chinese food.  At home, at the restaurants, at relatives' homes.  That's all I knew.  And I was not happy about it.  My idea of pizza was Pizza Hut, Papajohn's, Dominos, and Sbarros for a long time.  My parents did not care to take me out to any other cuisine other than Chinese food or fast food.   Sometime in late high school, a friend suggested we eat here to celebrate a birthday.  I fell in love with California Pizza Kitchen.  It is one of the earliest restaurants that opened my eyes to what ""dining out"" truly meant (compared to my childhood, you can see what I mean).  For years and years, I only ordered pizza from here because I LOVED it.  CPK was a treat.  I did not go here for just any reason.  Even after I discovered multitudes of delicious eateries in Hawaii and outside of the islands, I still love CPK.  Even as I slowly grew out of my tendency to eat at chain restaurants and hit up more hole in the walls, I still like it here as a stable option whenever eating with a group. This was the first CPK I ever ate at and in recent years, I have not been paying it enough visits.  This Ala Moana branch is BUSY.  It is CROWDED.  Account for waiting time!  The hosts are friendly, though, but unfortunately, reservations are not accepted.  As others have mentioned, waits can be anywhere from 20-60 minutes.   I came here for one of my birthday dinners this week (as it's the big 3-0, I decided to bring my parents out for something different, aka non-Asian).  The wait was only about 10 minutes since I made my boyfellow go early and put down his name. This time, we only ordered (between the 4 of us): wild mushroom pizza (5/5), california veggie pizza (3.5/5), chicken Caesar salad (4.5/5), and the two in a bowl soup (4/5).  My parents don't drink room temperature or cold water so I asked for hot water and the server nicely accommodated them. Other things over the years: Spinach dip (5/5) Yummy in the tummy... Margherita thin crust pizza (4/5) Chinese Chicken salad (5/5) YUM!!!! Thai crunch salad (4.5/5) Lovely combo of flavors Lettuce wraps (4/5) I would eat this each time if I could Fettucine alfredo pasta (3.5/5) It's decent Sesame Chicken dumplings (5/5) A little pricey but this is excellent",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu?start=140,3.96,3.97,3.828,3.248,3.966

We ordered our drinks and a short time later the waitress, Brooke, came back and tried to take our order. Some of us weren't there because my nephew needed some fresh air. The waitress was totally fine with coming back later.  The waitress came back to our table as soon as my nephew and our friend came back! I was impressed that she was ""on it"" and we did not have to search or wait for her. Our orders were taken and delivered to the kitchen. The food took some time to prepare, but it was understandable because the restaurant was completely full. There were many orders in front of ours.   Our food arrived and I was happy with the food that I received. I just had to order a pizza since this place is called California Pizza Kitchen. They got to have awesome pizza right? I ordered a Meat Cravers thin crust pizza. It features Italian sausage, pepperoni, applewood smoked ham, spicy Capicola ham, and salami. It was delicious!  I only ate half of my pizza because I'm on a diet. The waitress quickly boxed up the remainder of my pizza, delivered the check, and we were out of there quickly.

SERVICE: the service is always top of the line, the servers are always on top of things! i really love how they give house bread, and if you get it with the balsamic vinegar its the best!! LOCATION: the ala moana location is one of the most busiest i must say! but i do love the speedy service once your in there, the wait for the food is never to long! but there is tons of parking all around the shopping center PRICE: This is my favorite part! the prices are so good its reasonable for the quality of the food and service! this is my family go to place for all birthday and anniversary dinners! average cost of a plate is around $15 which is very affordable! OVERALL: overall this place has to be my go to place to have dinner or even lunch with family and friends! i love the vibes i get here its not to uptight, instead its a relaxing place to sit down and talk stories with your friends and family, its a good place to just sit back and enjoy some good food for a low price! i would recommend this restaurant to anyone because of the huge selection of food they have there! i also love how they have the pizza dough rewards cards which is a rewards program that gives you a dollar back for every $5 spent i believe! but they also do free appetizers when you join, and monthly they offer different things for members exclusive",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu?start=200,3.56,3.79,3.824,3.188,3.6980000000000004

A step above the rest, beyond the realm of delivery pizzas. I enjoy the atmosphere in the Ala Moana location. It's always busy, especially on weekends. They also have quite the variety of pizza to choose from. Some are well known and loved by all, others are unique and original. I been here a few times before. It's a great place for a date or if you're with a group of friends. I would have given CPK 5 stars but the service can be hit and miss in my opinion. In the most recent time that I have been here, our first server seemed tired and annoyed, devoid of energy. Granted we did arrive 30 minutes before closing but we couldn't help it. She passed us on to another waitress for whatever reason and she continued to help other tables. Our next waitress was great, she was lively, smiled a lot and brought us everything we needed. We could feel her energy. I could tell she cared. I would definitely go here again in the future. This is a great restaurant with a great atmosphere, and quality food.

We had pre paid so there was no monies that needed to change hands. When we got there there were 2 staff people and a manager trying to correct a mixed up bill at the register. Several minutes passed and they were unable to resolve the problem. We saw our pizzas get delivered to the shelf behind the register and tried to get one of the staff to give them to us but were told it needed to go thru the register. 15 more minutes passed during which the line kept getting longer. They finally figured out the person's bill, and then moved on to us. We showed them our credit card and they handed us our now very cold pizzas without using the register at all! Could have done that immediately and we would have gotten warm pizzas! While we were waiting a ToGo employee showed up and was given his order without needing the register.

We all shared spinach dip, avocado bacon egg rolls (YUM!) and chicken ginger wontons (best out of the 3 appetizers). The frozen mango lemonade was tasty (but pricey at $4.19!) and I got a strawberry drink thingie. My friend got iced tea with free refills. For entrees we got thai pizza, thai salad (full with avocado) and full Caesar salad. Oh, their bread with the pesto Olive oil thingie is to die for. I think it comes with the meal, as we kept asking for refills and they didn't say there was a charge. Dessert was the chocolate cake and velvet cake (chocolate was better). All that was $110 for 3 people. Not an inexpensive meal, but for the amount of food we got, and it was prepared well, we were satisfied. Service was great at this CPK.

Spaghetti was hot but the portion has gotten a lot smaller. Thin crust pizza wasn't crunchy but was chewy and hard to cut. Server refilled waters but never refilled my kids drinks.

This place is definitely my go-to when I can't decide on where to meet my girlfriends for a quick bite after work or for lunch during the weekends.  They've got appetizers, salads, tacos, pastas, pizzas, and alcohol, among some other notable items. Their food is consistent and full of flavor.  I especially enjoy their Chicken Tequila Fettuccine an Kung Pao Spaghetti.  Their popular BBQ Chicken Pizza is good too for the rare days I am craving pizza from CPK.  As for their salads, I enjoy the Chinese Chicken Salad and the Original BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad.   All of their appetizers are good, too.  Be adventurous and try something new each time you come here.  I'm sure you won't be let down.   Service is usually consistent - I have no complaints, nor do I have anything extraordinary to report.  The Ala Moana location gets really packed during the evenings and the weekends, so I do suggest you come early.  Wait times can be 45 minutes - 1 hour.  Luckily there's usually live music nearby for you to enjoy while you wait. They don't take reservations.  And there's bar seating if you don't mind it. I'm definitely a fan.  Check it out.  I think you will like it too.

565,Don N.,"Pearl City, HI",115,194,435.0,4.0,2016-01-25,"Stopped in on a busy Saturday evening at the Ala Moana location as we had to sample some of their new menu items. CPK has always been known for great California Style pizza, but as they've always experimented with new pizza flavors, they've been really stepping out beyond the pizza and pasta world. Food: The three of use all ordered new menu items..Poke Chop Salad, Seared Ahi, and Grilled Rib Eye. The Poke Chop salad was excellent, nice cubes of fresh ahi served over a bed of mixed greens. Seared Ahi was also a winner, slices of ahi grilled to perfection on outside leaving the interior perfectly rare, served over a bed of roasted farro and bak choy.. a little spicy which added a nice touch. And steak..oh yeah you can now order a nice 12 oz grilled rib eye steak. I ordered my steak medium rare, while the steak was not overly thick they still managed to cook it perfectly. I'm going to have a hard time in the future ordering anything besides the rib eye!  The only downside was the steak was topped with a generous dollop of compound butter, unfortunately they didn't put it on quick enough so it never melted as intended, instead it sort of sat there in a solid clump, I eventually just moved it to the side. The steak may have been off the grill for a few minutes before they applied the butter, small thing but noticeable. Oh..and the bread..the bread...oh my the bread. They changed the bread a little while ago..instead of the soft french bread slices they used to serve (albeit not big on the flavor or texture profile), someone on the CPK team decided to change it up and go with a crusty, crunchy, chewy, sourdough like baguette. Whoever decided this..give that person a raise! I could probably just eat the bread with a nice glass (or two or three) of wine and call it a day. Service: Busy as always, all CPK locations on the island seem like they can double their floor space and still be busy. The wait can back up during prime dining hours so be prepared or go during off hours. Even busy, the servers are attentive and manager at this location jumps in to lend a hand. We were seated, he recognized the server was still busy managing another table so he quickly jumped in to take our drink order, get us water, etc.  Atmosphere: Bustling, crowded, people laughing and having fun, everyone enjoying their meal seems to be the norm. Even with the wait, you will rarely see an unhappy customer who at CPK.  Tip..if you can snag a seat at the bar..especially during peak times you can skip the wait, chat with the bartender, and watch the pizza chefs work their magic. Value: Can get a little pricey..I think my rib eye came in at about $27 but that's actually a fair price compared to other places that do not match the quality. Our bill is usually a bit on the higher side but that's probably due to the consumption of some of their fine adult beverages.  The draft beer here is actually quite reasonable..the cocktail prices can get you though as no prices are listed on their cocktail menu.  Overall: We enjoy CPK probably a couple times per month..We appreciate the consistent quality of the both the menu items and service as well as their periodic new offerings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu?start=100,3.84,3.67,3.772,3.408,3.738

She gave us the sensor and said ""15min."" Alright. 15min later we were seated greeted and got some drinks. My fiancé wanted to try a new beer, so he went back and forth with waiter, and decided on a beer. When they brought us our drink bread came as well. 2pieces. So when our appetizer came I asked the lady (a woman with long hair and curls, I think she was the manager) if we could please have another round of bread with our artichoke dip. She rudely scoffed at us, rolled her eyes and sped off the tell our waiter to get us bread. When our food finally came I was beyond dissatisfied, the scampi was bland and had 2 noodles and about 50 pieces of zucchini. I barely touched it and was quite obvious I didn't like it. My fiancé also disliked his beer. The waiter then made a comment ""didn't like the beer."" But yet nothing was done about it. Our bill came out to $70, payed, tipped and left. I mean we're a very young couple so I understand the stereotype. I work in the restaurant industry, so I gave them the benefit of the doubt that it was lunch. But this was truly disappointing.

I pay more than $15 on a plate of pasta and you can't even give me at least a breast of chicken?? It wasn't even half a breast of chicken on my plate. Better to go next door to macaroni grill.

120,Michelle D.,"Honolulu, HI",351,11,,3.0,2016-07-09,"CPK is one of my favorite places to eat. I've been to most of the locations on the island, and this is one of my favorites because of the location and the convenience. This location in particular earns itself three-stars from me, and it's quite difficult for me to rate it less than five stars because I love this restaurant chain so much. SERVICE: This is the reason for my three-star rating. Hit or miss; ""hit"" most of the time, ""miss"" some of the time. I've gotten a few servers that were less-than-enthusiastic. Maybe it was a bad night; however, I'm not very pleased with the way they handle the Pizza Dough Rewards. TWO out of THREE times my family and I have dined at this location, they did not grant us the pizza dough credit (and mind you, it was a lot of missed dining credit). Being the Chinese gal that I am, I was disappointed because that means I wouldn't get my discount :( Even after I told the server(s) (they were two different servers on the two different occasions) about my Pizza Dough Rewards membership, and even after I wrote down my membership number on the receipt for them to see, I still did not get my points. I've never had any trouble with the other CPK locations, so either management at Ala Moana has to do something about their servers acknowledging the Pizza Dough Rewards, or CPK should implement a new system to have their customers get credit more easily. My favorites to eat here are the Thai Crunch Salad (no chicken, replace it with avocado!) and the Tomato Basil Spaghettini (not on the menu anymore, but I still love to order this). Recently, my dad also ordered the shrimp scampi, but we were disappointed because they barely gave him any noodles, and there was not much else on the plate (and it's one of the more expensive menu items!). Other than that, I'm almost always pleased with my experience at CPK. Maybe just go to the Kahala Mall location, and avoid Ala Moana.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu?start=180,3.16,3.59,3.716,3.1480000000000006,3.418

789,Michelle D.,"Honolulu, United States",351,11,,3.0,2016-09-07,"CPK is one of my favorite places to eat. I've been to most of the locations on the island, and this is one of my favorites because of the location and the convenience. This location in particular earns itself three-stars from me, and it's quite difficult for me to rate it less than five stars because I love this restaurant chain so much. SERVICE: This is the reason for my three-star rating. Hit or miss; ""hit"" most of the time, ""miss"" some of the time. I've gotten a few servers that were less-than-enthusiastic. Maybe it was a bad night; however, I'm not very pleased with the way they handle the Pizza Dough Rewards. TWO out of THREE times my family and I have dined at this location, they did not grant us the pizza dough credit (and mind you, it was a lot of missed dining credit). Being the Chinese gal that I am, I was disappointed because that means I wouldn't get my discount :( Even after I told the server(s) (they were two different servers on the two different occasions) about my Pizza Dough Rewards membership, and even after I wrote down my membership number on the receipt for them to see, I still did not get my points. I've never had any trouble with the other CPK locations, so either management at Ala Moana has to do something about their servers acknowledging the Pizza Dough Rewards, or CPK should implement a new system to have their customers get credit more easily. My favorites to eat here are the Thai Crunch Salad (no chicken, replace it with avocado!) and the Tomato Basil Spaghettini (not on the menu anymore, but I still love to order this). Recently, my dad also ordered the shrimp scampi, but we were disappointed because they barely gave him any noodles, and there was not much else on the plate (and it's one of the more expensive menu items!). Other than that, I'm almost always pleased with my experience at CPK.

My fiancé wanted to try a new beer, so he went back and forth with waiter, and decided on a beer. When they brought us our drink bread came as well. 2pieces. So when our appetizer came I asked the lady (a woman with long hair and curls, I think she was the manager) if we could please have another round of bread with our artichoke dip. She rudely scoffed at us, rolled her eyes and sped off the tell our waiter to get us bread. When our food finally came I was beyond dissatisfied, the scampi was bland and had 2 noodles and about 50 pieces of zucchini. I barely touched it and was quite obvious I didn't like it. My fiancé also disliked his beer. The waiter then made a comment ""didn't like the beer."" But yet nothing was done about it. Our bill came out to $70, payed, tipped and left. I mean we're a very young couple so I understand the stereotype. I work in the restaurant industry, so I gave them the benefit of the doubt that it was lunch. But this was truly disappointing.

We appreciated the high ceilings at this location, and how they made the space more inviting. Our waiter, James, was so friendly and worked well under pressure.

I've been to cpk many times before, and have had really good wait staff almost every time, but James was above and beyond awesome! ~Spinach artichoke dip was finished in less than 2 minutes, great appetizer :) ~The Pesto Cream Pene w/ mushrooms was delicious, I like that I was able to substitute the original accompanying vegetable (sun-dried tomatos), for something more to my taste. ~Poke Salad was okay if you are looking for raw, non-seasoned ahi, and salad with a light and tasty dressing, but my friend was looking for something a little more flavorful fish-wise. ~Thin Crust Pizza was awesome! I've notice that the thicker crust has less of the topping, and thin crust can get a little crispier (which is favorable amongst my friends)  ~Garlic Fettuccine Alfredo w/chicken was devoured in 5 minutes max, my friend really really liked it.  ~Kid's Curly Mac n Cheese w/edamame was great as usual :) there always seems to be a stray spaghetti noodle in it, but I feel as if it isn't complete without it. ~Butter Cake was so nice and warm, next time i'd request the scoop of ice cream be on a separate plate because, although it made nice decor, made the Cake colder, when the warmth really enhanced the flavor.

I've notice that the thicker crust has less of the topping, and thin crust can get a little crispier (which is favorable amongst my friends)  ~Garlic Fettuccine Alfredo w/chicken was devoured in 5 minutes max, my friend really really liked it.  ~Kid's Curly Mac n Cheese w/edamame was great as usual :) there always seems to be a stray spaghetti noodle in it, but I feel as if it isn't complete without it. ~Butter Cake was so nice and warm, next time i'd request the scoop of ice cream be on a separate plate because, although it made nice decor, made the Cake colder, when the warmth really enhanced the flavor. A good dessert to share! ~Chocolate Soufflé was god sent. ~Salted Caramel Pudding was better than expected! Had such good combination of textures and flavors. James knew quite a bit about the menu and was an amazing waiter, if you have him, strike up a conversation! He is very cool, I kinda wished that he would just sit at the table with us :) OVERALL, we had a great time in a welcoming environment with amazing staff and delicious food!

634,Donna L.,"Honolulu, United States",123,88,34.0,2.0,2017-02-11,"It's a real bummer I have to give CPK such a low rating, as it was one of my favorite go-to chain restaurants, but my most recent dinner here was quite unsatisfactory to say the least. Decided to go grab dinner here the evening of Halloween and was sorely disappointed... - When we first checked in, they said the wait was about 30-45 mins... no biggie, i always expect to wait whenever coming here, so we grab the buzzer thing and waited at Mai Tai's. Half an hour goes by, still no vibration from the buzzer or anything. We look over at the restaurant and there were tables available and no crowd, so we went to go check w/ the host, and they were like, oh we buzzed you and tried calling you. But my friend who had the buzzer the whole time said it never went off nor did she get a phone call. Ok, whatever... already off to a great start! Bleh, so we proceed to get seated... - Our server was nice and our dinner experience seemed promising at first, but alas that was not the case. *sigh* As our dinner progressed, he maybe checked on us once? Took him a while to finally come around to us again towards the end of our meal, at which point we just asked for the check and boxes. He then takes his sweet time to get all that. Apparently closing out all his tables and counting up his tips for the end of the night was more of a priority than tending to his remaining guests. Meh, definitely had better service in the past.  - Onward to the food! My friend's pizza came out barely even warm, like it's been sitting out for a while (I guess the pizza was ready before the rest of our entrees, so they just left it out). My friend takes one bite and was like nope, not happening -- cheese was all hard, and on top of that, they forgot the extra mushrooms my friend had asked for. We told the manager, and she brought the pie back to the kitchen. A few moments later, she brings the same pie back out (slice where my friend took a bite out of was still there!). It's like they just popped it into a microwave/toaster oven for a quick reheat. Then one of us made the mistake of ordering their ribeye (even though we all knew better than to order steak at a California PIZZA Kitchen!); requested medium to medium-well for doneness, and it came out medium-rare to medium, yummy meat to fat/gristle bits ratio was off, but the parts that I did eat were ok -- definitely not the best piece of beef (as expected), but it certainly wasn't the worst. I think the only saving grace was the ever consistent spinach artichoke dip! You know it's bad when that's the only good thing about the meal!!  All in all, it's like the B Team was on duty that night, because it was just all bad. Sadly, I've been noticing a steady decline in food quality and service over the last year or so. Not only that, but they've increased their prices! So basically you're telling me, I'm paying more to receive crappier food and service... hmmm somehow the two don't add up. I am boycotting this place for a while and suggest y'all do the same, at least until they step their game back up!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu?start=20,3.68,3.7,3.66,3.4320000000000004,3.6920000000000006

We looked over the menu a little more and decided on a lettuce wrap appetizer with chicken only. The waiter came back within 5 minutes and took our orders. U ordered the Wild Caught Seared Ahi on baby bok choy something called stir-fry roasted farro and shiitake mushroom. There was some type of demi glaze sauce which was really tasty! The dish was Topped with ginger which I should asked for without since I am to too keen on the taste of ginger. The seared ahi was cooked to perfection! Seared on the outside and raw on the inside, very tender. Tender and tasty morsels of ahi was pleasure to my mouth! The bok choy was cooked to perfection as well and the mushrooms and farro was great with the dish. The farro added more sustenance to the dish and made it very filling. I was highly pleased with my dish! As for my Agave Mojito, it was also very yummy. Wish the glass was much taller for $9.95. The seared ahi dish was pretty pricey at $24.99.

Because we had so much time just sitting and waiting, when the waiter finally came around we ordered right away hoping that our food would come fast.

We ordered a spinach artichoke dip, a flatbread, and a Chinese chicken salad. All which tasted great per usual.

The Bolognese on the other hand was made decently. The pasta almost felt on the cusp of Al dente, any less and it would need to boil further. Nothing special but also nothing to complain too much about. Maybe I'd have been more of a fan of the pizzas. The star of the show here for me was definitely the desserts. The butter cake and salted caramel pudding that we tried really were well made. The cake was just the right size and sweetness with a healthy scoop of vanilla right on top and a side of whip cream. The pudding was creamy but light and also textured with the cookie crumbs right under it all. The caramel taste was light and not as strong as your favorite grocery store candy bar.

Service was great, but food not great. The pizza is JUST ok. The salad  consisted of limp lettuce, and a Caesar's salad dressing that was more oil than the creamy part of the dressing I'm used to at other restaurants.  It's going to take me a lot of effort to go back to CPK. For pizza I'd highly recommend Harbor Pub. Not the nicest place to eat, but the pizza is 1000% better than CPK.  Did I mention the noise level is super loud too?

304,Lisa M.,"Honolulu, HI",22,18,3.0,1.0,2017-07-23,"We tried to eat at this location yesterday at 2:35pm. They were able to seat us immediately. At the time of seating I noticed that the floor surrounding our table was covered in large chip crumbs and crust pieces. I figured no big deal as it was the weekend and they were packed. The first gross out moment was when the server brought our water, he started spitting while talking and it landed all over my arms and the table in front of him. We ordered appetizers and food as my family was very hungry. When they brought the bread out and the plates, we noticed that all of the plates were dirty with crusted on food and sauce spots. We asked to see the manager. We were told he was probably in the back office, but would come out. After several minutes he arrived and apologized and said that he would make sure it was fixed. While we were waiting again I noticed that my daughter had not touched any of the bread, appetizer chips, or even her water. When I asked her about it she said she was afraid to drink it because the water looked like it had food in it. After examining the water glass more closely I found food (yellow and red colored specks) caked onto both the outside and the inside of the water glass. At this time, the same spitting server returned with a new stack of plates. The top plate was still dirty. At that point we got up and left. The spitting server protested that we should just wait because all of our orders were already put in. We were told them we were too grossed out to eat anything after seeing their lack of cleanliness. We went down the walkway to Macaroni Grill and had a suprisingly delicious and clean experience. I just returned to the island after having been away for the last two years, so it's not like I didn't know what to expect from this restaurant. I used to be a frequent weekend customer back when the lady who was the manager walked around and was always involved in checking on the customers. This current gentleman manager's complete lack of follow through and clear lip service was the fastest way to loose my business permanently. He should have been the one to bring the clean plates, and he should have been the one holding the entire kitchen, dish washing, serving, and busing staff accountable for cleanliness. I am surprised that this restaurant passed their health inspection. They most definitely do not deserve and 'A' and I would not recommend that anyone eat here.

I'm not a fan of vegetables being cut using a spiralizer such as the carrots in this bowl. It makes it hard to eat and makes you think you're getting a lot of food but you're not.

Started off with an Agave Mojito and a cup of water. We looked over the menu a little more and decided on a lettuce wrap appetizer with chicken only. The waiter came back within 5 minutes and took our orders. U ordered the Wild Caught Seared Ahi on baby bok choy something called stir-fry roasted farro and shiitake mushroom. There was some type of demi glaze sauce which was really tasty! The dish was Topped with ginger which I should asked for without since I am to too keen on the taste of ginger. The seared ahi was cooked to perfection! Seared on the outside and raw on the inside, very tender. Tender and tasty morsels of ahi was pleasure to my mouth! The bok choy was cooked to perfection as well and the mushrooms and farro was great with the dish. The farro added more sustenance to the dish and made it very filling. I was highly pleased with my dish! As for my Agave Mojito, it was also very yummy. Wish the glass was much taller for $9.95. The seared ahi dish was pretty pricey at $24.99.

Decided to go grab dinner here the evening of Halloween and was sorely disappointed... - When we first checked in, they said the wait was about 30-45 mins... no biggie, i always expect to wait whenever coming here, so we grab the buzzer thing and waited at Mai Tai's. Half an hour goes by, still no vibration from the buzzer or anything. We look over at the restaurant and there were tables available and no crowd, so we went to go check w/ the host, and they were like, oh we buzzed you and tried calling you. But my friend who had the buzzer the whole time said it never went off nor did she get a phone call. Ok, whatever... already off to a great start! Bleh, so we proceed to get seated... - Our server was nice and our dinner experience seemed promising at first, but alas that was not the case. *sigh* As our dinner progressed, he maybe checked on us once? Took him a while to finally come around to us again towards the end of our meal, at which point we just asked for the check and boxes. He then takes his sweet time to get all that. Apparently closing out all his tables and counting up his tips for the end of the night was more of a priority than tending to his remaining guests. Meh, definitely had better service in the past.  - Onward to the food! My friend's pizza came out barely even warm, like it's been sitting out for a while (I guess the pizza was ready before the rest of our entrees, so they just left it out). My friend takes one bite and was like nope, not happening -- cheese was all hard, and on top of that, they forgot the extra mushrooms my friend had asked for. We told the manager, and she brought the pie back to the kitchen. A few moments later, she brings the same pie back out (slice where my friend took a bite out of was still there!). It's like they just popped it into a microwave/toaster oven for a quick reheat. Then one of us made the mistake of ordering their ribeye (even though we all knew better than to order steak at a California PIZZA Kitchen!); requested medium to medium-well for doneness, and it came out medium-rare to medium, yummy meat to fat/gristle bits ratio was off, but the parts that I did eat were ok -- definitely not the best piece of beef (as expected), but it certainly wasn't the worst. I think the only saving grace was the ever consistent spinach artichoke dip! You know it's bad when that's the only good thing about the meal!!  All in all, it's like the B Team was on duty that night, because it was just all bad. Sadly, I've been noticing a steady decline in food quality and service over the last year or so. Not only that, but they've increased their prices! So basically you're telling me, I'm paying more to receive crappier food and service... hmmm somehow the two don't add up.

The mac and cheese tasted okay but it was a little gummy and rather cool, which makes me wonder if it is freshly made or frozen, or if it just cooled on the line before getting to our table. The Bolognese on the other hand was made decently. The pasta almost felt on the cusp of Al dente, any less and it would need to boil further. Nothing special but also nothing to complain too much about. Maybe I'd have been more of a fan of the pizzas. The star of the show here for me was definitely the desserts. The butter cake and salted caramel pudding that we tried really were well made. The cake was just the right size and sweetness with a healthy scoop of vanilla right on top and a side of whip cream. The pudding was creamy but light and also textured with the cookie crumbs right under it all. The caramel taste was light and not as strong as your favorite grocery store candy bar. Price was okay but if you're looking for pasta, I'd go elsewhere. Next time, I'd go for the soups or pizza.

Definitely make a reservation because this restaurant seems to be busy all the time. Luckily we did and we got seated within 5mins from the actual time. We ordered the bbq chicken pizza, bbq chicken salad, pepperoni pizza, artichoke spinach dip, red velvet cake, and the brazed short rib with mac-n-cheese. The artichoke spinach dip was the best from what my wife and I remembered, but it didn't taste the same and the dip was warmish cold. The bbq chicken and salad were delicious as usual. The brazed short rib with mac-n-cheese was amaaaazing. It had a nice spiciness to it, but it was very flavorful with the right amount of heat. The pepperoni pizza tasted mediocre. We've always loved their red velvet cake with ice cream and vanilla bean sauce, aaaand we still do. Damn it was diabetes good. Overall, it was a reminder on why we don't come here often, and that's because it's expensive. My wife's salad was $25, the red velvet was like $6, my short ribs was $23, my sons mediocre pepperoni was like $16, and my other sons bbq chicken was about $16. If you eat here, it will break your wallet. We had a $50 gift card and we still ended up having to pay an additional $50. Our waiter, Pak was pretty fast and friendly. He was the one that recommended the delicious brazed short ribs.

22,Porsche S.,"Honolulu, HI",15,187,1712.0,3.0,2017-12-30,"We had a really large party when visiting CPK. I called ahead and they said that if I gave them an hour notice prior to coming in they would be able to set up our table and we would only have a short wait. I called ahead and by the time we got there we only had to wait about 10 minutes. I wasn't too happy with the table arrangement that they had for us because half our group was separate, but we couldn't ask for much on a Saturday night. The service was pretty horrible. The server was missing half the time and it took forever for our food to come out. They even forgot one of our kids meals. Usually they bring out the kids food first, but instead the kids were starving and they had to wait for our food to come out before they were able to get their food too. CPK food is always good, so there's no complaints there, but the service was just really poor. With such a large party they should have been able to accommodate us with multiple servers or something. Hopefully next time our service is better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-honolulu,3.64,3.39,3.612,,3.49

We ordered spinach and artichoke dip, the garlic noodles with mushrooms, and the shrimp scampi pizza (seasonal special right now). I am really enjoying the shrimp scampi Pizza this season.
