8,Charlotte P.,"Sulligent, AL",1,5,,5.0,2012-02-16,"This was our first visit to CPK.  We had a really great and attentive waiter, Jason, who made it a fun first experience. He had a great sense of humor and was able to do a really great job of helping us make good menu choices we would enjoy. Jason even brought a piece of salami for us to try before choosing to order a pizza including it as a topping. The restaurant was extremely clean and attractive with contemporary decor.  The restrooms were very clean as well.  The food was excellent, and the pizzas we ordered had a very fresh taste and had many unique and and unusual options. There were great choices for any taste preferences, and many options besides pizza.  You could also choose salads, pasta, or even tacos.  We liked our choices of the BBQ Chicken Pizza and their Meat Lovers pizza.  We even shared a dessert of the brownie sundae, which was good, even though a little pricey at $6.00. We split it between the three of us though, since it was pretty big. I'd say this is a great location to try this pizza chain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover?start=20,,,,,
3,Luke M.,"Birmingham, AL",6,27,,4.0,2012-07-01,"My kids love this place. Pizza is good.  I especially like the California Club pizza.  Have also gotten pasta which was good, not great.  For some reason place can get a little loud, not sure if it is layout or normal clientele.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover?start=20,,,,,
27,Sarah D.,"Calera, AL",33,59,,3.0,2012-07-23,"My family and I went there recently. Our waitress paid little attention to us. She took a long time to even greet us, serve our drinks-which were never refilled, and serve our pizza.  I complained later and got some nice coupons, so my mom, husband, and I went back and got an old classmate of mine to serve us. She was great! I honestly believe that she was good to us because she cares about her job, but it was nice that I also knew her! The food is good. I like their pasta a lot, but there needs to be more of it. But, overall, it's good food. I would just lower the prices some. So, thanks for caring, CPK. Your response and good bartender that served us the second time is what saved you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover,,,,,
28,Tim K.,"McCalla, AL",13,25,,5.0,2012-11-12,"I have been looking for a good pizza place since I moved to Birmingham. By luck I found California Pizza Kitchen, I have heard of them before but never tried their pies. They were doing free meals for Veterans and thought I would partake. Very good pizza, the combination of the crust sauce cheese and toppings worked really good together.  And I have to give a shout out to the company. They gave free meals to Veterans all day Sunday and Monday for Veterans Day, Not only that they gave each Veteran who came in a coupon for a free meal at any later date, this company gets the very rarely seen, a bobo two thumbs up for service and taste. Meals are generally between 10 to 15 dollars, worth every cent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover,,,,,
16,Ee Vonn Y.,"Oakland, CA",1167,1709,3217.0,2.0,2013-08-05,"Great service, environment, yet very mediocre pizza. The thin crust wasn't good. It was burnt and I had trouble biting into it. It was burnt beyond chewing. Get the original since it's small and sufficient enough for an adult while the crust being soft and fluffy for you to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover,,,,,
1,Jim M.,"Milwaukee, WI",4,173,9.0,2.0,2013-10-04,"Horrible... ordered pizzas to go and waited at bar for 45 mins. We received drinks when ordering, but after that, no one came by and we were at the bar!!   Watching the staff, they were very confused and seemed to be running around without a leader.  The pizzas finally came, but had obviously been sitting around as they were quite cold. They made new ones in about 7 mins. Hence the reason for 2 stars instead of 1. Quality of the pizzas was mediocre at best.  I would not recommend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover?start=20,,,,,
29,Mia B.,"Champaign, IL",44,72,186.0,3.0,2014-02-17,"It was ok, I love saucy pizza and I specifically asked for extra sauce and the pizza came out dry as a door knob.  I had to ask for more sauce on the side and ending up dipping my slices into the sauce which made the pizza better.  I would eat here again, but I'm still searching for my pizza place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover,,,,,
0,Delores W.,"Barboursville, WV",0,9,5.0,5.0,2014-03-04,"Been here twice while we are in Birmingham. Great food.   Megan,  the manager and Ashley,  our server were fantastic.  Will be back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover?start=20,,,,,
4,Scott H.,"West Chester Township, OH",0,8,,1.0,2014-07-22,"Been here twice.  Good food but service is well below average.  Now I understand why. Tonight I observed someone in a management function walking around the back counter, pouring his owns drinks, and eating dinner at the bar. All while dressed inappropriately for a manager.  Fish stink at the head.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover?start=20,,,,,
19,Courtney O.,"Birmingham, AL",113,40,21.0,5.0,2014-11-11,"This is the most awesome pizza place in Birmingham, AL hands down.  I absolutely love this place! What makes it even better is that they have a great staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover,,,,,
22,Britney M.,"Mobile, AL",47,20,2.0,1.0,2014-12-28,Holy terrible service. we had the most awful waiter no personality. No service whatsoever. We were brought hot tea (with anticipation of it being cold) he laughed about it. We asked for ice we never got. He was so rude when he was to take our order. No more CPKfor us #serveraustinsucks #sticktoSLICE,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover,,,,,
24,Alyssa H.,"Vance, AL",47,1,,1.0,2015-06-01,"This pizza is certainly not for me. The crust was extremely thin on the deep dish, and it was burnt, which of course burnt the cheese. There was no sauce and hardly any toppings to speak of. The waitress was very sweet, though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover,,,,,
18,Philip D.,"Birmingham, AL",0,11,3.0,2.0,2015-08-17,"We live close by and have dined here numerous times. On a recent visit, the food was good but the restaurant needs to be updated and cleaned. There is a certain odor when you walk in. I'm not sure if it's the carpet or what but it's a sour smell that is not pleasant. Also, don't look up. The ceiling is filthy. There is dust and dirt all around the air vents that is not noticeable because the ceiling is black. But you can see it during the day time. It's on the higher walls as well. I hope they take notice of this and make changes. It's hard to eat in a dirty/smelly place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover,,,,,
12,Mike M.,"New Iberia, LA",0,3,,2.0,2015-10-17,"CPK is one of my favorite restaurants - but - this location is consistently a let down. The food often is flavorless or stale (chips) or brought at the wrong time (if appetizers are ordered at the same time as the main meal). The pepper grinders never work, the sweet tea may or may not be sweet on any given day. I can't see a restaurant can get this many things wrong on a perpetual basis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover,,,,,
25,Donna S.,"Hoover, AL",0,2,,2.0,2015-10-23,"I use to love CPK.  However, I don't really think that CPK is a good value now.   Very little chicken on our salads for the price.  You can find much better meals for this price around Hoover.  Also the table was sticky from previous guests.  We will not be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover,,,,,
20,Cat A.,"Birmingham, AL",0,99,10.0,2.0,2015-12-12,"I love CPK's frozen pizzas you get at the stores. However, the dishes in their restaurants aren't quite as good. I probably wouldn't mind the food as much if it wasn't so overpriced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover,,,,,
21,Stacy T.,"Prattville, AL",53,2,,5.0,2016-01-15,"This isn't just a excellent pizza place they also have amazing other dishes like Mahi Mahi fish tacos, salads and my favorite chicken piccata.

23,Pam H.,"Birmingham, AL",0,2,5.0,1.0,2016-03-09,Where do I start? Party of 7 arrived @11 we waited 45 minutes for food and  it came out cold. I sent the Bianco Flatbread back and it never arrived. Horrible!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover,,,,,
14,Melody H.,"Birmingham, AL",21,131,9.0,2.0,2016-03-26,"Not sure what happened at this location, but the last couple of times we've gone service has been slow, but even worse, the pizzas have been cooked poorly.  The one that I got most recently was a thin crust and the edges were almost charcoal, there was also some black powder on the bottom, like the oven was dirty or something.  The regular crust pizzas have been overcooked as well, but not quite as bad.  Think they need to adjust their ovens or pay more attention to the cook on their pizzas - and don't serve them burned.  Not sure I'll be back to this one.  Never had a pizza cooked badly at the Summit location, so I'll stick with that one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006
15,Hannah M.,"Birmingham, AL",294,72,30.0,4.0,2016-04-30,"Experience consisted of really great food but less than average service. We sat outside, which was lovely, and had appetizers first then ordered a salad. The buffalo chicken salad is amazing. I ate every bit of it! The service was mediocre. As we all know, this can make or break a restaurant experience. I'll go back for the salad but hope for better service next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover,3.08,3.08,3.08,,3.0800000000000005
13,Cassie W.,"Savannah, GA",8,25,24.0,1.0,2016-06-11,"This location is the worst. Slow and way too over priced. I will NEVER go back to another CPK in my lifetime. This was the straw that broke the camels back. I pay an extra $2 for 3 tiny pieces of chicken on my pizza. My husband pays $1.50 to make his pizza thin, which is less crust. THEN, when I ask for extra ranch, it's going to be .50 extra. I don't appreciate being nickel and dimed to death. I was anticipating my to-go boxes to cost. I hope CPK goes bankrupt.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005
10,Greg R.,"Birmingham, AL",40,212,,3.0,2016-06-22,When did CPK stop being a pizza restaurant?  Hardly any of the menu is about pizza anymore.   Service was average to good.    The pizza was served hot and pretty good.   I read some the bad reviews and luckily my experience was better.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96
11,Rupen  P.,"Hoover, AL",127,3,,1.0,2016-07-09,I believe corporate needs to start paying more attention to this location.  It used to be good over the years... But now it sucks...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84
17,Lisa S.,"Pelham, AL",0,10,1.0,2.0,2016-07-09,"Cpk is usually really good, but my food came out half cold & half hot. The noodles were half cooked. The shrimp wasn't all the way peeled (I had a jambalaya pasta dish). They were veryyyyy slow & it wasn't lunch or dinner time. The waitress asked if we wanted more drinks & we thought that meant free refills so we got charged for more drinks without knowing we'd be charged. The booth was dirty.  I was not happy to spend $72.33 on an awful experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-hoover,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
