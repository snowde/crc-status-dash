31,Nikita P.,"San Diego, CA",247,43,3.0,2.0,2012-01-15,"This location is a lot more worse than the one in the River Oaks Shopping Center. The pizza is not as crispy and the food, in all, just does not taste as good/fresh as the one at the other location in Houston. Also, the service at this location is not good. I've had bad waiters/waitresses that forgot to bring my entire order. There is also a wait at this location compared to the other. I always go to the other location because of all these issues and because they are only 5 minutes away from each other. Unfortunately, however, the food quality has tremendously gone down and service is poor now and that has affected my rating.

They're very accommodating to those with food allergies, and I always enjoy a good meal when I come here. The servers are very attentive and pay special care to their customers. Their menu denotes which items are gluten-free with a GF symbol and unlike most restaurants, the options are actually great and not just limited to boring salads. Even the salads here are a work of art though, so don't shy away from them!  The roasted vegetable salad with Dijon balsamic vinaigrette and the original BBQ chicken chopped salads are superb, and two my top favorites. The white corn guacamole + chips small plate features the best guacamole I've ever had... and as a Latina, that's saying a lot. It is complex with a unique sweetness from the corn.

The staff is always so great about doing a half and half pizza and 86ing one ingredient while adding another. The thin, crispy pizza crust is great while still standing up to heaping ingredients. I hate tomatoes, but I love pizza, and this is truly THE pizza place for anti-tomato persons, like myself.  It's a little on the pricey side, but the ingredients are fresh and the combinations are original so I don't mind the price tag.  The flavored lemonades WITH FREE REFILLS are another draw of CPK. I'll start with a Kiwi Lemonade, then enjoy a Mango Lemonade, and finish my meal with a Strawberry Lemonade.

30,Anthony B.,"Houston, TX",59,148,,3.0,2013-02-02,"I, Mason, the culinary dachshund announce that I am very disappointed in Anthony in his several visits to California Pizza Kitchen.  What does the name say? PIZZA. What does Anthony order? SALAD. Does it say California Salad Kitchen? NOOO! Ok, I like the occasional cold juicy lettuce heart piece, but why go to CPK and graze on arugula and garbanzo beans when you can get BACON on a pizza!! Or BBQ Chicken. Or Salmon. Or  Pepperoni. But NOOO, Anthony gets a salad *rolls eyes*. Ok, on to the review. I actually had some snacks of salad leftover Anthony brought home. They do make nice salads, some of the nicest around, with fresh ingredients, nice toppings, and will accommodate any adjustments to the offering.  Anthony does follow my instructions on bacon - when available, order it, whether a salad, a burger, cheesecake or used to stir a bloody Mary. But I digress. Nice dressings. Crisp.  He actually had a pizza a couple times. Chicken Chipotle adobo sauce, fire-roasted poblanos and Monterrey Jack with corn, beans and salsa. Now, Doxies are German and we prefer some nice knock wurst, but damn that chicken was tasty. Not only did I get a .5 nanoseconds' worth of a slice but I got to lick the plate. The BBQ chicken was delicious, thin crust so my lithe, lean figure isn't compromised.  With all this goodness, he went back and got SALAD again.  I'm not allowed in the CPK due to those archaic laws not allowing dogs in restaurants. OK, so I lick the occasional ankle but Anthony had me tutored at the vets and I don't hump ankles.  But I digress again. Anthony says the people are nice, the place is clean, service is attentive although it's a crap shoot who shows up to take your order, deliver food and the bill.  They are willing to box up leftovers for me, it isn't called a doggie bag for a damn cat, right?  Well, folks, I have to close out this review as dinner time is approaching. Should I look malnourished, or exceptionally cute?  Ahh, the difficult decisions a doxie faces in life.

Was disappointed to see they got rid of so many of the menu items I had loved from them in the past. The Japanese eggplant, the said goat cheese and pepper, pear, and many other pizzas are off the menu. Actually, even with their name containing pizza in the title there didn't seem to have as many pizzas to choose from as they once did.  However, they did have a smaller apps menu, which had two salads on it which would make a good personal starter. I opted for the asparagus one, and it was tasty. The other was a wedge salad. The pea soup my beau order was good enough for me to probably order it next time myself.  The mushroom pizza while good wont be my favorite either. I will have to try another next time or ask if I can make a pizza from the ingredients they have listed.

My biggest problem was that the overall impression I got from all the CPK staff - from the manager on down - was that this seemed kind of like business as usual w/them - no big deal.  This CPK needs to learn about service.  No one here has a clue they are in the service business, and also their food is overpriced IMHO.

Post-dinner rush, the dining room was full but there wasn't a wait - we were immediately seated in a cozy booth by the windows.  Our server immediately stopped by with waters and we decided to partake in the white sangria as reward for a successful shopping excursion  Our sangria arrived moments later - a nice fruity blend, not too sweet and filled with large slices of pineapple.   Next came the seasonal white corn & black bean guacamole served with yellow and blue corn tortilla chips: delicious! The sweet white corn was a welcome addition to the usual guacamole. We followed our tasty starter with the spicy chipotle chicken pizza on honey wheat crust: in all it was a very spanish-themed night.  The pizza sauce was perfectly spicy and tangy, with a slightly BBQ-esque consistency, and the corn & black bean salsa atop the perfectly baked crust was fabulous. I have one hands-down requirement for pizza: the crust absolutely MUST be cooked all the way. Thankfully, no dough-y crust to be found here.  And don't let me forget - the dipping sauce was a frothy, cilantro ranch perfect for the tangy crust. Service was top-notch as well, never overbearing but always present and helpful at exactly the right time.

Here's what we got and a short review of each item: -spicy chicken quesadillas small plate: when they say small, they aren't joking. It was like 4 pieces total. However, they were delicious! They came with a really yummy dipping sauce too. I saw online that if you sign up for some point card you get a small plate free, so this ended up being free for us. Otherwise I probably wouldn't want to pay $7 for 4 small pieces.  -tortilla soup bowl: so yummy and great portion! Would probably get this again.  -chipotle chicken pizza: fantastic! Everyone in my family loved this. It came with a sauce that you drizzle on top which was really tasty too (we ended up asking for more). Would definitely recommend this.  -jerk chicken pizza: ew. That's really the most appropriate way to describe this dish. It was way too sweet for my taste and I couldn't eat more than a few bites. No one in my family liked it.

We have currently only been twice, but the servers are great. Happy people and super personable. The reason I gave it a 4 star review is honestly because of the overall cleanliness of the place. At a recent visit when I unwrapped my silverware, I wasn't sure if they were water marks or they were just dirty. But either way, if it doesn't look clean and I have to wonder if it is, that makes me a little nervous. Also the bathroom. I hate using the bathroom in public places anyway because of the fact that I have Lupus; I am more prone to getting sick from germs because of my low immune system. The toilets weren't very clean, neither were the floors, and overall I just felt like I needed to shower after I used the bathroom. It didn't help that it was oddly dark for a restroom and the door opens almost right in front of a stall.  I know how hard it must be to keep public bathrooms clean throughout the day, but I think what needs to be considered is, ""Hmmm, would I want to use this bathroom?

I came here for a late dinner last night around 9pm with a friend. The place was decked out in Halloween decor which was fun. We were sat immediately but at a tiny window table which was a little silly considering almost the entire restaurant was empty.  Our server took about 5 minutes just to greet us and take our drink orders. I asked for a gluten-free menu and was handed a 3x5 flash card size menu with FOUR kinds of pizzas to choose from---sad. I ended up ordering the pepperoni and my friend ordered the barbecue chicken both on gluten-free crust.  It took about 10 minutes for us to get our food. The gluten-free pizza crust was somewhat chewy and lacked flavor, but the toppings made the pizza worthwhile. The cheese was hot and had great flavor. I really liked how my pizza had two kinds of pepperoni. My friend's toppings were great too, but her crust was also chewy. Overall, the experience here was a positive one, but there was a lot that could have made it better.

They have always had a great staff (most I knew by name and they knew my usual order), great food, a great facility, and it was just a treat to go.  No longer. Tonight seemed to be a sign of lack of good leadership (or any at all).   We walked in along with another couple and there was no hostess to seat us. Several waiters (some just chatting at the registers) and what I think may have been either the bar tender or manager (only think because he had a landyard around his neck) just looked our way and didn't move.  When the hostess (Ch...) finally arrived she had no idea who got there first and made no apologies. She was rude and put off when we chose to sit at our table not at the chair she had pulled out for us.  The waitress (who was really nice by the way) accidentally spilled a glass of water on the floor. It sat on the floor until it totally soaked into the carpet AND ALL THE ICE MELTED. When we left no one had yet addressed it. The waiters all walked over it, the bus staff walked over it, and who probably was the manager walked over it (it was in the main walkway of the dinning room).  If that wasn't enough we watch the person we think is the manager handle food with only one glove on but using BOTH hands.  People were having to raise their hands at their table to get their waitstaff's attention. And then it wasn't even their waiter or maybe it was because it was never the same person twice helping them.  The restrooms also are in a state of disrepair. You would think at least the hardware to lock a door would work (even the fix to the broken one was broken).   Usually my reviews give people the benefit of the doubt but this just wasn't right.

I called back a second time and successfully placed my order. 13 minutes later I arrived at the restaurant and called to notify them. 13 minutes after THAT I called back to inquire about the delay. After all, I had placed an order 26 minutes before for a SALAD with no hot items. I was told it was coming right out. 3 minutes later I called back and out popped a server with a check but no food. It took over 30 minutes before the salad arrived in my lap from the time I placed my order. The server was friendly, but I asked to speak to the manager. He was NOT so friendly. In fact, he served up attitude right from the start. Trying to approach the situation in a laid-back manner, I said ""Dude, we have a problem."" Before I can get in another word, he said, ""First of all, DO NOT call me dude. My name is ----."" I was seriously appalled. This is a MANAGER! Here I am trying to be light-hearted and relay to him the situation and he confronts me with nothing but attitude and sheer rudeness. Now I'm beyond pissed. He said that he wished I would have called sooner so we could address the problem. Um, I called your restaurant a total of 5 times before I could get a salad. I called 3 times to get a human face-to-face. My patience had been completely exhausted. We carry out an exchange that isn't worth my time detailing and I leave calling corporate to file a complaint.

Why would I go to California Pizza Kitchen and order steak, seafood, or pasta when I can get a high quality gourmet pizza? Not only is just a small section devoted to the pizza, but they have taken away a couple of my favorites. They don't even have friggin kalamata olives anymore! The pizza that they do have is better than Pizza Hut or dominos, but for the price we paid for our pizza I expect something a little more high end and ""different"". Meaning make me a pizza that I can't get anywhere else.

Served with housemade ranchito sauce and herb ranch.)  The pink sauce which is their housemade ranchito sauce is addictive.  I always ask for extra because I dip everything in it.  In fact, my waiter even suggested trying this sauce on my pizza and it was awesome.  The pizza is a thin crust with generous crispy edge and the whole thing is packed with flavor.  I don't always eat the crust when it comes to pizza, but here I do.  This is one my favorite pizza places.  More reviews on that later.  Hmmm, maybe I need to create a list for all of my favorite pizza places.  Any who, I digress, now to the bartenders.  You know, they always do a good job.  Why do I like them so much?  Some people phone it in but not here.  They want to make sure that you are enjoying your beverage.  They are quick to remake a drink without hesitation if you request it.  (And for the record, I've only done that once.)  The point is that they care about the customer and every drink they make.  Can't say the same about some other places.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-2,2.8,3.19,3.19,2.804,3.034

The hostess told us our server would be right with us, got us both waters and went back to the hostess stand to sit down and look at her cell phone. We sat and waited, waited, and waited. 15 minutes and 6 servers walking by us later and we still had not been acknowledged. This was not a busy night as it was a Wednesday around 8. So being hungry and not greeted we got up, left and grabbed some dinner just a block away. Now here is the kicker, a we drove by after eating we still saw our two glasses of water sitting at the table we would have been eating at.

112,Iris T.,"Houston, TX",132,233,291.0,4.0,2018-01-12,"Family from out of the country were here and it was their last weekend with us. Due to our dietary restrictions (vegetarian, nothing in the allium family), we've been limited to our kitchen and a few Asian eateries so I was very interesting in expanding. Oh, one in our party is a strict vegan on top of the no allium rule. We chose this place.  I had gone to a few locations before, but it was years ago. I didn't remember much other than pizza. Because of that, we started from square one.  It was around 6:40 pm on a Friday. Most of the party arrived and the ones who got there first requested for a table to be set up - 8 adults, 2 babies. We were seated within 5 minutes.  Our waitress - never caught her name, but I was on the tail end of the flu so my hearing was still off - came by almost immediately to take our drinks when we were still getting settled but we were ready the second time. Water, no ice.  The rest of our party joined us around this time. We needed her back because we couldn't just freely order anything with a green leaf (for vegetarian friendly) and expect to get it. We needed pointers. Unfortunately, that was when more customers came rolling in and her section got full. It took a while but questions were asked and answered with her going back and forth and we eventually got: Bread and Olive Oil - this is complimentary and delicious. The waitress assured us the herbed oil was onion/garlic free but when it reached our table, there was a strong smell. Even with my partially blocked passages, I detected something off. Sadly requested for just the oil  and more bread and she came back with everything saying she double checked and there isn't any allium but she did as asked. Most of the party have abstained from items in the allium family for decades. It sometimes doesn't need much other than to be stored close to smell like it. It makes other things off putting. The oil used is a good extra virgin. On a challenge at the end, my sister and I shot down the remaining oil and there was that peppery burn of oleocanthal. Crispy Mac N Cheese - this is a small plate and we got two. It's purely Mac and cheese that's breaded and deep fried. There are 4 pieces to an order and are delicious. Then again we got one each so maybe that's why? Vegan California Veggie - this was for the vegan in our group. Ordered without the normal marinara and subbed in the neopolitan sauce (crushed/diced tomatoes) and took out the onions and cheese. It had a bit of everything! Other than cheese.  California Veggie - same as above but with cheese. Colorful, the flavors worked well despite the amount of ingredients on it. If I had to pick a well-balanced pizza, this would be the winner.  Wild Mushroom - took out the original base and subbed in olive oil. I love fungi and this was good and simple.  Three Cheeses & Tomato - I actually don't recall anything that needed to change with this. I call this the amped up margherita. A classic but with multidimensional cheese. A winner! Belgian Chocolate Soufflé Cake - got one to share. It sounded too good! I wouldn't call it a souffle but it is lighter than your typical cake and less intense or sweet but it was beautiful. The nibs were key. General notes: - Food was excellent across the board. Mixed feelings about that herbed oil but thought the pure olive oil was perfect. The dough is chewy. I adore chewy pizza dough with a crisp edge and patchy lightly burnt bits. - Service was good. She was as helpful as could be but it got somewhat slow as soon as all her tables were full. We were there for almost two hours.  - California Pizza Kitchen May be confused on what consists of vegetarian cuisine. The crispy Mac and cheese lacked a green leaf on the menu. Upon further questioning, it contains egg. Vegetarians can eat egg, but no meat products (seafood and insects included) or products directly derived from meat like gelatin. It's vegans who abstain from eggs and dairy along with anything from animals, whether directly or not. Honey, for instance, is not vegan.  - Setting was clean. We didn't have our own plates from the beginning but that was rectified right before we got our entrees.  - For 8 adults and a snacking 23 month old (the other infant had her bottle), we ordered 2 of the small bites, 5 pizzas, and 1 dessert. We also had two rounds of bread and oil to start off with. We finished every last bit. It amounted to around $14 per adult, including tip. I'd say it was money well spent!  The best part: the visiting family enjoyed it!  Thanks for letting us leave with our bellies full and smiles applied! It's not often the case if allium isn't allowed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-2,2.84,3.07,3.07,,2.9779999999999998
