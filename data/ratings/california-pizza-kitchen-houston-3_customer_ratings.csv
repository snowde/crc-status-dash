133,Peter C.,"Chicago, United States",29,132,3.0,3.0,2012-01-31,"I love me some good pizza.  I came here with my wife before seeing a movie at the nearby last-of-its-kind-in-houston theater. I hadn't been to a CPK in a long time, and I remembered the pizza as being quite delicious. I ordered a bit of wine since I had a few hours before driving home, and was pleasantly surprised -- only $5 for a very generous pour.  The pizza was good, though a bit cheesier than I generally like. The server was awesome -- he had the kitchen slightly burn the pizza, as I requested. Then we got the bill -- it turns out the $5 price tag ""by the glass"" was for a mini pour, and I had gotten a different, normal pour, which was closer to $10. It was my mistake, for not reading carefully, but I felt a bit deceived. ""By the glass"" means by the glass, right? So by all means this is not a scathing review. So-so pizza and the little trick they played on me got the 3 star review.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-3?start=40,3.24,3.24,3.24,3.308,3.2400000000000007

My salad was too citrusy for my taste and I couldn't finish it. We shared a Spinach and Artichoke Dip as an appetizer but we both agreed that the one my sister makes tastes better. I would not recommend it. It tastes like it comes out of a jar and it probably does. You can definitely get a better salad that costs less elsewhere.

CPK is one of those places where neither I would choose nor complain about.  Pizzas: Pear & Gorgonzola (2/5): Pears, sweet caramelized onions, hazelnuts, blue cheese, topped with chilled field greens in Gorgonzola ranch. I wanted to try something foreign on my pizza. I immediately chose this when I saw ""pear"". It was a different story once I took a few bites. Pear was bland.. I thought it would bring a sweet contrast against the distinct flavors of blue cheese and hazelnut. Chunks of blue cheese over powered the pizza with some bites. My friend and I didn't enjoy this as much.  Original BBQ Chicken (4/5): BBQ sauce, smoked Gouda, red onions, and cilantro. CPK is highly known for its famous Chicken BBQ. The pizza is perfectly tangy and sweet with a kick. Chicken is bland and overcooked sometimes. Order this if you are afraid to go outside your zone. Spicy Chipotle Chicken (4/5): Chipotle adobo sauce, shaved poblano, Monterey Jack with house made corn, black beans, salsa, cilantro, and lime cream. The cream is superb... I always ask for additional! If I would describe this, then I would say it is the pizza you would get if Chipotle restaurants decided to expand their menu. By the way, poblanos are not spicy at all.  California Club (5/5): Smoked bacon, roasted chicken, mozzarella, avocado, arugula, basil, romaine with lemon pepper mayonnaise. Hands down the best one I have tried at CPK. Fresh. Light. Delicious. It is like a chicken salad pizza! The lemon pepper mayonnaise goes perfectly well with other ingredients. Just make sure you order one when you do try this place!  Wild Mushroom (3/5): Shaved cremini, shiitake, portobello, white mushrooms with slivered scallions, black pepper, Pecorino Romano and mozzarella. Nothing really appealed to me... Felt like something was missing. My friend loves mushrooms, so I tried a slice of it. Great for vegetarians.  I prefer this location than the one in Memorial City, too many kids. It is more of an adult place here. There are days when the waiter fills my water before it reaches rock bottom. Service is average with plenty of seating available. I believe the longest wait time I had was about 10 minutes.  CPK serves other food items, which has significantly expanded since my first CPK dining. I don't know if I would try the other items such as salads and soups.

1,Michelle U.,"Houston, TX",719,67,149.0,2.0,2017-04-19,"My first time coming to California Pizza Kitchen (CPK) in about 4-5 years and I was a bit surprised that they are more of an actual restaurant serving a variety of foods, rather than specializing in pizza like they used to. For a restaurant that is specifically a pizza kitchen, their pizza seems to come secondary on their menu.  Food: - They do serve complimentary French bread.  - Fried mac & cheese: not worth it 3/5 it was kind of bland and only comes with 4 small pieces.  - BBQ Chicken Pizza: what I came to CPK for. 3/5 Definitely not as flavorful as it was years ago and gave me an upset stomach shortly after eating it.  Overall, would not come back here. For a restaurant that is a pizza kitchen, it's disappointing that the pizza is just mediocre.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-3,3.24,3.4,3.4,,3.3360000000000007

97,Kris K.,"Houston, United States",0,1,,4.0,2017-04-24,"Pizza is fantastic for a chain.  Only issue that ordering delivery through Yelp is arrives cold. We have now ordered twice to test the system.  I thought the first time may have been a poor experience with delivery.   Pizzas are worthy of ordering but only if they arrive hot. The delivery service does not have any type of hot bag. Therefore, they arrive in a brown CA pizza kitchen bag cold.   Great pizza- but pick it up yourself.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-3,3.16,3.38,3.38,,3.2920000000000007

They just aren't what they were the pizza is so mediocre, no real flavor and expensive. If you want great Pizza try Solario or Luna. I think it's time to wrap it up CPK let a better restaurant have the space!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-3,3.04,3.33,3.33,,3.214

90,Naya C.,"Houston, United States",38,11,3.0,2.0,2017-07-03,Please don't come here for the gluten-free pizza if you're allergic. My $7 gluten-free frozen pizza from Kroger (SmartFlour) is soooooo much better. The crust on CPK's $17 pizza kept getting tougher after every bite until finally I couldn't eat it anymore because it was like rubberized cardboard. My jaw hurts from trying. The BBQ chicken toppings were almost decent..  but I could probably make something better out of canned chicken and ketchup at home.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston-3,2.88,3.34,3.34,,3.156
