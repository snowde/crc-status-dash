65,Chikting c.,"Houston, TX",34,78,3.0,4.0,2012-02-19,"i think CPK worths more than 3 stars but adding the food and service.  we came here on a friday night bc Cheese cake factory was packed, and this place is right next to it. after waiting for 5 minutes, we got seated. I tried the italian soda, which is flavored soda with cream. I changed to another tea after having a zip of that soda. Food is decent, i recommend the vegetarian pizza with japanese eggplant. the baby broccoli gives a great texture for the entire pizza. My bf got the meat cravers thing, and he said it wasn't bad.  service was great.

93,Helen C.,"Mesquite, TX",64,61,41.0,3.0,2012-04-25,"This place was very popular with my coworkers, so I ordered from here a lot. I found the staff to be very pleasant to deal with, and enjoyed the perks of getting free meals due to my large orders. However, I found the food to only be so-so which is a shame since I really liked their frozen pizzas over the last few years. Anyway, here is my thoughts on all of the food I've tried over the past few months: Carnitas and habenero pizza: Only OK overall, but the sauce/salsa that comes with it on the side is REALLY good. Spinach and broccoli soup: tastes like it came from a can - Campbell's to be exact.  Pesto Chicken thin crust pizza: Just OK. chicken tequila fettucine - it was pretty bland. The ""jalapeno cream sauce"" tasted like just a white sauce. The peppers in it tasted fresh and good, but didn't save it.  Japanese eggplant pizza - My husband liked this well enough, especially the mushrooms, but I didn't like it overall chicken club sandwich: It was decent, but would have been much more enjoyable had the bread been warm. But that might just be because I ordered it to-go. Hawaiian pizza on thin crust.: The toppings on this were good. I only wish their thin crust was crispy rather than soft. I'd gotten used to their thin crust being crispy from the frozen pizzas. Update: Moroccan chicken salad - this salad is amazing!! I absolutely love it and have ordered it twice now, and will order again. A few more entrees like this and I'll have to give the place an additional star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston?start=60,3.2440000000000007,3.2440000000000007,3.2440000000000007,3.2440000000000007,3.2440000000000007

Their curbside take-out is super convenient. The mall parking can be crowded and takeout orders would not be the same without this service. I've had a few salads here and they have been wonderful. They are full of interesting ingredients and extremely flavorful.

So based on my multiple instances here (people's birthday dinners, lunches with friends, etc.) I've been coming here for quite a few years. I'm not here often, but my multiple visits seem to have added up. The pizza is always delicious. The crust could use a hand or two, but the actual toppings and cheese and stuff makes it really delicious. I love the chipotle chicken pizza, chicken bbq, buffalo chicken, and a few more I can't remember. The good thing about this place is that it ends up being really cheap when you share. Went to a friend's birthday dinner, we ordered 3 or 4 pizzas and fed six people with under $45. Not bad at ALL. So yeah, great place, the service is fine, never noticed it being bad or good. It's just average.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston?start=60,3.3440000000000003,3.3440000000000003,3.3440000000000003,3.3440000000000003,3.3440000000000003
8,Esteban Luis F.,"Houston, TX",10,49,7.0,3.0,2012-07-14,"At California Pizza Kitchen, I ordered for my wife and I their Five Cheese Pizza w/ Fresh Tomatoes and Thai Crunch Salad.  Photos attached. The Five Cheese Pizza with Fresh Tomatoes is worth 5 stars. Bling.  It was delicious from first to last bite.  Its taste is 10x the value for which it is priced.  If it were a company, it would be grossly undervalued and potentially capable of shaking up the Dow Jones Index of blue chip companies. The Thai Crunch Salad is an interesting although colorful but sad salad.  It  resembled Ramen Noodles in a foam cup that was then easily plopped on a plate.  All that remained was adding boiled water. Ramen Noodles can be found at a local grocery store for about $1 for 4 cups of noodles.  The Thai Salad tasted fair at best.  However, it is over priced.   Service earns a mix review:  Our host at CPK appeared lost and distracted while at work.  Our waitress was polite and courteous.  Yet, she is unfamiliar about menu items, nor is she confident to make menu recommendations. Food was delivered timely.  Follow up service to refill tea and water orders was frequent.  A dessert menu and options was offered. Turning CPK around to pick up the remaining 2 stars (out of 5 stars) requires subtle changes and minimal upgrades: 1. Service from wait staff ranges from poor to elementary.  Train to create a uniform level of service that is on path to proficient.  Sales will bolster and tips will run with rises in sales. 2. Upgrade from paper napkins to cloth napkins.  It would compliment the alcohol and wine purchases patrons make to compliment their meal. 3. Reinvent the Thai Crunchy Salad. I wish CPK best in luck and skill to earn the remaining stars.   - Esteban",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston?start=40,3.2440000000000007,3.2440000000000007,3.2440000000000007,3.2440000000000007,3.2440000000000007

91,Kat N.,"Sugar Land, TX",206,12,9.0,4.0,2012-08-14,"The service has improved :) I have frequent this CPK many times and I generally order the same thing at both Houston locations. This location is a bit oddly shaped for lack of better words. It wasn't busy either :T Galleria is better than Memorial Nonetheless, this place killed my pizza craving. When I entered the restaurant, I caught an employee (possibly hostess) off guard. I believe she was ready to leave for the day but she stopped to grab menus, and sat me in a nearby booth. I give her mad props for keeping it professional and taking care of guests first.  Although I was waiting for my friend's arrival, my server EMMA promptly greeting me and took my drink order. I had wanted to surprise my friend with a birthday sundae and she was really sweet to keep it a surprise. After my friend's arrival and placement of the order, Emma offered a complimentary basket of sourdough bread and butter. I feel that she went above and beyond because from my understanding, it's only brought out upon request. We didn't have much a problem with refills either. Emma even waited for my friend to turn his head at the end of the meal so that she could run out with the surprise. That's just AWESOME!  The food itself is pretty consistent. I love my California Club on a thin crust. :) Overall a delightful experience. Not a lot of negatives... I know I didn't write any but they're not perfect just yet... There's room for improvement but with this kind of service at the mall... I might start skipping passed that food court :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston?start=60,3.04,3.04,3.04,3.44,3.0400000000000005

No excuse for the standalone locations though.  It's a Pepsi place, so not off to a great start. They've added some cool little appetizers, which is cool, and some of them are fairly decent. I like the hummus and they have a couple eggroll things - I can't remember the flavors, but one is delish, and one is weird. The pizzas are good enough and the salads can be really good (I like the Chicken Cobb), but they are huge. I went with just my kid and it might have been smarter to split something instead of letting him order off the kids' menu. They have a .99 sundae on the kids' menu, and that made my kiddo pleased as anything.

I also noticed that the manager on duty was attentive to every table. He was always asking if everyone was enjoying their meal. The food is always good here, but not extravagant (why it's not 5 stars). I enjoyed the chicken tequila fettucine (I think that's what it is)... it had a hint of a lime-y creamy Alfredo sauce... sort of like a delicious curry tossed in with noodles. YUMMY. I also enjoyed the avocado egg rolls. I love avocado so I knew that I couldn't go wrong with that. It similar to BJ's.  The BBQ chicken pizza is also a must!

The works gets you a supreme that has all the toppings but doesn't taste as great as a properly cooked meat pie.

The atmosphere is very inviting and it has a great location if you want to do a little shopping in the memorial area, particularly the mall. Recently went with a group of four and we all left with a similar feeling of ""Ehh"". Overall the food was unimpressive. We started with the ""guacamole"" which was actually a chunky salsa of roasted corn, black beans, tomatoes and a few pieces of avacoda in it. Not really a guacamole, but good flavors. Our opinion of it was basically ""Well, thats pretentious!"" It wasn't bad, just not as described. The pizzas that we ordered (Original BBQ and Margherita Pizza) were both just OK. The BBQ chicken had a very flavorful sauce, but the chicken was bland and the crust soggy in the middle. The Margherita pizza was good, with big chunks of mozarella and sliced fresh basil on top. The crust on this one was cooked more consistently.

Neither of us had particularly eaten at CPK more than once, and decided to give it another go. The wait staff was nice enough and the food is a little too bland for me. One thing that definitely turned me away for good, was the fact that toward the end of our lunch a huge dusty roach was crawling along the booth! Of course, I scurried away, because they're terrifying. We notified the staff, to which a server proceeded to grab a plate (for what, I don't know) and some napkins. The manager caught wind of the situation and merely told us that since the booth was located along the windows and carry-out door, roaches are prone to coming in and offered nothing more about the situation.

34,Zain R.,"Houston, TX",222,318,912.0,4.0,2015-10-24,"This was a tough review to write that's why I followed my history professor's advice of letting cooler heads prevail. After letting the food and the experience digest, I decided to go with the four star rating rather than a three. I had friends waiting for me waiting inside when I got there. The hostess seemed to be a little preoccupied with putting her fingers through her hair and looking more playful rather than attentive but I dashed right in waving at my friends without letting her have the chance to acknowledge me so maybe I should not be so critical of her.  After I seated myself, the server quickly approached me and asked me for my drink. She was on fleek. When one of us asked for the potato soup and they were out of it, she was quick to recommend the squash soup. It was everything I needed right there and then. *side note: I have not been to CPK since 2010 because I discovered that they stopped serving their Mango Chicken Tandoori Pizza in 2009. It was my absolutely favorite thing ever! I really hope that they bring it back!!! I came to this location back in 2010 after a breakup with my bff and I had bad memories associated with it but after the service I received this trip, I am a changed man* Minus one star for the really tasteless oil thing served with the bread. Call me an EVOO snob but that oil mixture served  with my bread lacked flavor like a fake Chanel at the Met Gala. We ordered the Sicilian and the Roasted Artichoke + Spinach with added chicken pizzas. I really like my vegetables and if anyone who knows me knows that I loved making my own pizza (dough made from scratch) but both pizzas were just oh so incredible. I don't eat pork products - mostly because they make my stomach hurt - but I not only broke my religious dietary code that night but I also decided to not follow my self inflicted dietary code and I am so glad I did. The Sicilian is one mean pizza and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to give meat pizzas a try. The dessert was just the right amount of rich. Although I couldn't stomach more than three spoonfuls, my bf and his brother loved every bite of it. All in all, coming to CPK after a nearly five year hiatus has made me a happy customer and I will definitely frequent it more often.  P.S.

Many years have passed, and the food and service have changed into something completely opposite of my childhood pizza wonderland.  My bf and I have eaten here twice in the past year or so. The first time wasn't half bad! We both enjoyed the Sicilian flatbread pizza and the chicken tequila pasta. The second time (aka today), however, was just terrible.  Our server's name was Luisa and she was just terribly awkward. She would ask us questions and when we would reply INSTANTLY, she would stare into our souls for about 3 seconds before replying back...Weird. Anyway, we decided upon the Hawaiian pizza and the chicken alfredo, (can't remember the exact name) both of which were unappetizing. The Hawaiian pizza was really greasy and did not have fresh pinapples on it. The least they could have given me for a 6 piece, $15 pizza... The pasta had a very little amount of chicken and tasted sort of off. Can't really explain it, maybe it was just me. All in all, we weren't satisfied with the food we ordered.  Luisa took forever to give us the check and forever to pick it up afterwards. Really annoying considering that there was barely anyone in the restaurant and we just wanted to get out of there.

38,Nothing But The Trut H.,"Houston, TX",99,196,186.0,1.0,2016-12-08,"This review is strictly for my last visit which was Veteran's Day 2016. I ordered from the VD menu ... Hawaiian pizza. I also got the chocolate moose dessert. Even though I didn't pay for the pizza, I was extremely disappointed with its quality. I wish I took a picture of it. Extreme thin crust, a few pieces of small pineapples here and there, and all the ham were just plain (no applewood ones)!!!! I wouldn't be paying $13.99 for a crappy pizza like that. I couldn't really believe how CPK went down on the quality like that. Smh. The dessert was okay. It was around $6. It was super duper sweet plus overpriced. If I was dining alone, I wouldn't care about getting that. Since I felt so bad about this, I had a talk with one of the managers on 11/23/16. He promised to mail me some free coupons, and it had been over 2 weeks now! I don't think it takes a long time to receive them. He probably just wanted to lie about it in order to brush me off. Heh ... okay if that's how he wanted me gone ... I will be gone for good. No second chance to try them out. CPK asked for it, not me. Anyway, I had zero interest to deal with liars. I will just go back to Kroger to get their frozen pizzas. No worries. They are cheaper and taste 200% better than CPKs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48

Taste - 2/5  - Our order consisted of a bowl of potato soup and ""The Works"" pizza.  The soup was not white or cream colored as expected.  But almost the ""golden"" color.  Totally not what was expected.  The pizza was loaded with toppings just just lacked flavor.  I asked for a Cherry Coke and sent it back for a regular because it had a funny taste. Quality - 2/5 Although the portions were large, I felt the meal was overpriced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52

32,Chirag S.,"West University, Houston, TX",1,6,,2.0,2017-04-22,"The food we ordered was okay, but the ambience and service left something to be desired.  First of all, the music was far too loud, especially for families with small children.  There were at least 5 other tables with young children; the music level felt like we were at a club.  We had to yell to communicate at our table.  I spoke to the manager; he stated that the volume is ""a set level at a set time.""  My suggestion: change that level.  We dined at around 8p on a Saturday.  This wasn't an issue in the past. Secondly, we ordered Merlot and received Pinot Grigio.  We ordered kids spaghetti and got kids fusilli.  The waitress then suggested that we should have ordered ""spaghettini.""  I've never heard of confusion around the term spaghetti.  They did ultimately fix the food/drink errors and take the erroneous items off of the final balance by having them show as comped, but their suggested tip (the calculated values at the bottom of the receipt) included those erroneous items. I used to love this place but don't think I'll be back any time soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-houston,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52

28,Amy O.,"New York, NY",13,54,5.0,3.0,2017-06-09,"I know this place has the word pizza in the title but to me its all about their salads! Location: Not great at all, its in memorial city mall and so if you're just wanting to go here then parking is awful. If you're in the mall walking around thats a great opportunity to grab some food. Food: Their pizzas are fine. Their salads are GREAT! Their thai salad is what dreams are made of. I try to get it every time i'm in town, however sometimes the thought of driving over there and finding parking is enough to deter me. The times I have eaten inside, the service is fine. Typical chain in the sense of the servers don't seem to care too much either way about what they are doing.

26,Andy C.,"Houston, TX",1,8,8.0,1.0,2017-06-19,"It was not event 50% full on Sunday night.  The service was slow as it took them almost 30 min to prepare: 1) a salad dish; 2) a pasta dish ; 3) a pizza and 4) medium rare ribeye.  It took them another 15 min to get a kid's BBQ pizza and 2 ice cream sundae.  You guessed it right: the ice cream were melted. There was no team work with the entire wait staff and the managers.  We waived to the staff at the counter for service, one staff got attention of another staff, who tried to get a a manager's attention.  And no one came until 5 min later came our waitress.

The manager that took our drink order brought out a ""surprise"" for us when he found out it was our first ever visit here - a sample of the White Corn Guacamole and Chips. It was delicious and such a nice gesture! The pizza we got was the Mushroom Pepperoni Sausage - also super delicious! The pizza comes with 6 slices as the menu says, although they are usually meant for one person since the crust is a lot thinner than you would expect. We shared our pizza and the Crispy Mac & Cheese appetizer, which turned out to be just enough food for the two of us. The staff was very helpful, with someone always stopping by to check on drink refills - even if they weren't our server.

44,Tier W.,"Pearland, TX",7,42,12.0,1.0,2017-07-13,"What a horrible experience during lunch today (Keep in mind the restaurant was not busy or full housed), first my co-worker asked if a specific drink could exclude lime because she has a citrus allergy. The waitress said no, then said she would be back to provide us some complimentary bread. We waited almost 15 mins, then the manager comes over & says we can adjust the drink by this time it's too late so we ask the manager where the bread was, he said let me go check on that & we will be right back. He never returns, another 15 mins later our food comes out (no complimentary bread). The pizza was luke warm as its was sitting out for awhile.  At this point, I didn't want to ask them to remake because I'm in a rush & have to get back to work. I tell our waitress to rush our check as we were eating because we have to go. It's almost 20 mins later & their was some issue w/them splitting the check between 2 people. Finally, they get the bill sorted out & we pay then leave. I'm now walking with my co-worker & we both started feeling sick.

Like idk how the owners have people who are inconsistent with their job responsibilities still on pay role. I'm always waiting up to 45mins at curb side for my order and I only order the salmon pieces from here. The customer service sucks and they're ALWAYS TRYING to over charge me.

40,Steven P.,"Plano, TX",0,9,1.0,1.0,2017-10-11,"Unfortunately, this is one of my wife's favorite places to eat and it's the only location reasonably close to my house. As a result, they will most likely continue to get my business and disappoint. I've ordered with them multiple times, I've eaten inside a few times as well and either way, it's awful service. There's usually one single person running around doing everything while everyone else sits around, literally. I saw the hostesses sitting down behind the podium where the guests sit when they wait. Terrible. Every time I order, I either have to go in to get it or wait 10-15 minutes at curbside until they decide to bring out my cold food. I call in to order and sit on hold so long I hang up and call back in. The other thing that is frustrating is that if you actually make your own effort to get someone to help you, most of the employees will be rude and catch an attitude with you. If you are a patient person and LOVE this place, keep coming back. If you are going on a date or business dinner/lunch, don't go here.

We got offered another meal by the manager who   us within seconds  but we actually didn't care much about it since we were almost done we our dinner, we finished the pizza anyway.
