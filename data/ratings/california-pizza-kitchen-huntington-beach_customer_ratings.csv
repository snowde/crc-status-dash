The white pizza was delicious, and I was sad to see it gone when I finished. The pear and gorgonzola is also a personal favorite, but I decided to mix it up this time.  The staff was all very friendly and prompt. Service overall was great. They also had this little computer monitor at each table, where you could keep track of your bill and play trivia games.  Plenty of TVs and seating, with a quality drink list.

Even though my work is practically 20 ft from Bella Terra, I refuse to eat at the restaurants since they're all bland, overpriced chain establishments. However, we didn't want to drive anywhere so I figured a quick lunch at CPK would be sufficient. When we sat down at our booth, we both noticed that there are mini ""kiosks"" where you can scroll thru the menu, read news online and also pay for your bill. Pretty neat. For my meal, I ordered the Pepperoni pizza with wheat crust (boring, I know but I wanted to keep it simple). I've had this before at the Irvine location and it sucked but I was pleasantly surprised that this time around, the pizza tasted fresh and the dough had a good, chewy texture with a hint of sweetness. It was good but definitely not great given that it exceed my low expectations.  Overall, I would not come back here again due to the high prices ($12 for that Pepperoni pizza!) and mediocre food but at least CPK redeemed itself from my last dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-beach?start=120,3.76,3.76,3.76,3.1160000000000005,3.76

Makes it so damn annoying to walk through.   I haven't been here in a while but I hear they have little screens at the tables that you can use to order and pay now? I'll go check it out one of these days.  Service here is pretty much the same as in any other chain pizza-pasta restaurant.   They servers are nice and they'll come check on you from time to time. Nothing exceptional.  I always order the roasted garlic chicken pizza, and sometimes, the garlic cream fettuccine. Both are about $10, if I remember correctly. I like how they make the pizzas here. The crust is thin, but still thick enough so that it's not crunchy and charred. The fettuccine tastes okay, but it gets boring after a few bites. I had this brownie and ice cream thing once and it was good, but not worth the price.

277,Dean W.,"Irvine, CA",325,449,235.0,2.0,2012-03-18,"I went here Sunday night. Place was packed, so there was a wait for our food to arrive. A rather long wait. The wait was one of the first things my party noticed. Appetizers took about 15-20 minutes to arrive (lettuce chicken wraps) and our pizzas came out 15 minutes after (so 30 minutes from time of order). Another negative is the pizza I *always* get when I go to CPK is the Roasted Chicken Garlic - they ""ran out"" today. How do you run out of a pizza? I thought everything was made from scratch. If that's the case, how can you not make more? It's not like I went on a slow night, it was Sunday night.  I ordered the next best looking type of pizza on there - the Spinach Artichoke and Chicken. When it came out the crust was nearly burnt, it was hard as tack and I barely managed to finish the whole thing.  Our waiter was great, and I know it's not his fault the kitchen failed to produce probably one of their more popular pizzas, nor was it his fault the food turned out crappy.  I doubt I'll come back to this CPK - miss the one that was South Coast Plaza.

It has always been an enjoyable dinner everytime i've been there and thats starting from about 10 years ago..? The last time i went, the fettucine noodles were a bit undercooked and the sauce for the chicken dumplings was a bit too tangy. I must say their complimentary bread there is good though.

For more than one occasion, I've given this place a chance in improving our experiences there. I've never really had a problem waiting for a table. And most of the servers there were real kind and courteous. However, what makes this place less extravagant is the delivery of the food. I'm vegetarian and for a number of times, I would inform the servers specific instructions to be certain that there won't be ANY meat on my plate. Unfortunately, more than 70% of the time... there would always be at least one or two pieces of chicken found in my entree. What makes it worse is that I'd take my girlfriend (who is also vegetarian) here and she too would have the same experience. On one specific occasion, me and my girlfriend had ordered a salad. Surprisingly enough, there was no meat found lurking in our food. However, we found a strand of hair instead. We kindly asked our server to have our salad replaced, which she was more than happy to. A few minutes later, the manager came back and tries to accuse us that we had left the strand of hair in the salad... explaining that none of their cooks has long hair and all always wait hair pieces to hold their hairs up while they cook.

Sat at the bar, just myself and waited for about 5 minutes.  A gentleman wearing a blue dress shirt saw me and without hesitation came over to greet. Got me a water and communicated with another gentleman behind the bar, most likely the bartender.  The bartender then comes over hands me a menu and rudely says do you know what you want to order, as if he had something better to do. I very politely said no I will just need a minute. Spent about a minute or two looking at the menu and made my selection. The bartender walked past me probably about two times. Not once making eye contact. I then realized maybe I should close my menu to signify I am ready so I closed the menu.  The bartender walked again by me twice his head was up and i am pretty sure he saw me. I waited another 5 minutes with my menu closed and looked over to my left where the patio is. The bartender is talking with a female crew member. That just about did it for me. Thank you gentleman in the blue dress shirt for starting me off and telling your crew member to take care of me, it's a shame he didn't follow through with his responsibility.

263,Lori H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,11,,5.0,2014-01-12,"My good friend and I had just come from a movie. Upon arrival, we explained we were cold and would prefer a booth. The hostess made us feel very welcome and sat us in a nice booth, right away and away from the cold.  Roxanne, our server came over right away as well, greeted us warmly and took our beverage order. We explained that we might order an appetizer but since we were unfamiliar with your menu we asked for some bread to tide us over which she brought right away, along with some delicious flavored olive oil! Yum! After tasting it we were intrigued and when Roxanne checked back to see if we were ready to order we got in a really fun conversation with her about it, the type of conversation where you realize you're going to have a lovely meal because your sever loves her job, cares about her customers and is really fun, to boot! She was very  knowledgeable, explained what seasoning they put in the olive oil and that it is made fresh every day! Upon our request, she was even gracious enough to give us the brand of olive oil you use. We told her we still weren't quite ready to order so she said she would check back.  We were having so much fun talking and tasting and enjoying the bread and olive oil! Roxanne came back in a timely manner and again, being very knowledgeable and professional answered all our questions about the menu. She said that she would recommend what we were considering so we placed our order. Roxanne must have noticed that we finished our bread and was sweet enough to bring us more and more olive oil, too!  We ordered the lettuce wraps and we did not have to wait long at all! They were absolutely delish! We loved the ginger-sesame sauce and me, being a spice nut, I asked if CPK had any kind of hot sauce. Roxanne offered two kinds and I went wild over the habanero one! It tasted homemade but I forgot to ask. It was a decent portion but when we ran out of lettuce Roxanne cheerfully brought us more. Gotta get my veggies! LOL! Well, we had an amazing meal! Roxanne could not have been nicer and checked back several times. She took care of all our needs and even brought containers so we could take home our bread and olive oil! What a sweet gesture! Roxanne is top notch and definitely a KEEPER!!! Thanks, Roxanne for making our evening so enjoyable! You ROCK Roxanne! You deserve a raise and to be employee of the month (if you have that? Ha!)! We will be back very soon for more lettuce wraps, bread, olive oil and to try something new as well! CPK is tops in my book now !!!

172,Shawn M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",12,14,2.0,1.0,2014-06-06,"I will spare a depth description of being served raw food, a lack of apologies by anyone in a managerial position. Here is the email I sent to their management and to their corporate offices. messing up what I ordered is one thing, Serving me raw food and management to engaged in conversations with bar patrons is ridiculous and entirely inappropriate. In fairness I will alter this review to show what response they have given to me if I should ever hear back.  To Whom It May Concern: Yesterday June 5th 2014 I ate at your Huntington Beach location 7851 Edinger Ave at around 7 PM. My previous experiences eating at this and other CPK locations has always been good and the quality of food has also been good. However yesterday the management and cooking staff failed miserably and I can assure you I will not be returning to this location ever again. The issue surrounds what I ordered and the way in which is was cooked, or should I say in this case, dangerously undercooked. I ordered the Chicken Picatta, something I tend to order often when I visit CPK. David, our server who was the only pleasant part of this meal was attentive and brought my food to me and the rest of my party in a very timely and professional manner. I began to eat the dish and got pretty well through it before I realized that the chicken I was eating was raw inside. While I understand there can be some occasional miscommunications with the kitchen staff over the timeliness of the orders and the items within an order, this was ridiculous. The other two people in our party of three got their food first, mine came about 4 minutes later. There should be no reason since I was the last one served for my food to not have been fully cooked. This is inexcusable to me and David our server was not to blame. When I brought the issue to his attention he was very quick to remedy it and what appeared to be just a host, came by to let me know the new piece of chicken and pasta was being cooked.  What is annoying about this to me and what I hope you will address to me is why a member of management did not personally come to my table and apologize? I would have understood in spite of concerns I might have for my health given that I have no idea how much raw chicken I had consumed. However no one from the CPK management team did so. Perhaps I can save you some time in wondering what your management was doing, they were standing at the bar for the length of our entire meal 1 hour and 3 minutes talking with two patrons at the bar. The conversations must have been quite important to not leave this post for that long of a time and certainly eclipsed the need to possibly go and personally address a guest who was just served raw poultry. I hope the conversation was worth the damage to your reputation, I am in the service industry and while I know your probably not the least bit concerned with Yelp or other venues where people can appraise their visits and give honest feedback, I feel many more consumers need to know what they can expect if something should go wrong at your restaurant.  I feel it is ridiculous I should come in and spend money somewhere on food, have it be served dangerously raw to me and not even have a member of your management say something as little as ""we are sorry"" to me. This location is in an area where there are several options for eating and considering the amount of time I spend in that area and the fact I live in Huntington I guess I will spend my money elsewhere. I most certainly will not be returning to your location given this ridiculous situation that I was willing to let go if your management had been able to pull themselves away from whatever life changing conversation they were having in order to say sorry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-beach?start=160,4.0,3.69,3.69,3.0120000000000005,3.814

He was prompt, kind, thoughtful, and professional. We had our 2 year old son with us who was starting to fuss a bit since he was hungry, and Kyle brought us some extra bread to tide him over until our food came.

It came out barely warm, loaded with cheese, and not enough artichoke. Not sure why it's a CPK recommended item.. Next came The Works pizza.

My Hun and I tried this location out one night celebrating a promotion. We walked in at about 430 (usually when business is not very busy) and asked the hostess for a table for two. She says Okay give us one minute we will clean one for you. Sure, as I glance around the 20 empty booths in front of me. We waited for about 5 minutes til we were seated. Our server greeter us and didn't tell us his name (lucky for him). We asked him for waters to start and a bowl of soup. He brings that out then asks if we were ready to order. I asked if he can bring us a side of lemons then we will have an answer for him! Somebody else brings the lemons out for us a couple of minutes later. 10 minutes pass no signs of our server. We finished our soup and sat there waiting and waiting. So finally I grab another lady's attention and ask if she can put our orders in for us. She was very sweet and did just that. Our ""server"" then kept walking back and forth from our table but never checked in with us. We wanted to order drinks but weren't able to because he seriously never came back. Someone else drops off our food and still the server did not come by. Even though we were seated right next to literally right next to the p.o.s. System where he was putting in his orders. About two bites left in our food LO AND BEHOLD our server speaks to us!!! We ask him for the check (since we didn't know when we would ever see him again) and guess what....someone else closed it out for us!!! Man I did not want to tip that guy but I wanted to be fair to the people that he will tip out later that did help us. Being in the industry myself, I understand you get caught up at tables and things happen but the guy walked by us about a dozen times. He could have easily stopped for two seconds! Meanwhile, in front of us there was about four cpk employees eating and talking in front of us. People kept stopping by to talk to them and they were kinda loud.

82,Michael E.,"Garden Grove, CA",423,63,35.0,5.0,2015-07-19,"Pizza is something you can literally walk around the corner and find and be pretty satisfied with. What sets this place apart from the rest is their level of service, and friendly staff that makes people repeat customers. It's located inside the Bella Terra area so there's plenty of parking, they remodeled the place pretty recently so everything looks more modern and clean. Expect to be greeted immediately, they're very attentive here and if you don't believe me you'll see for yourself when you visit. Ask to sit in Andrew' section, he'll take care of you.  I feel like the first couple of moments when you meet your server set a precedence on how the rest of the meal goes. Andrew was easy to talk to and made sure we had everything we needed throughout the meal. Service was fast and Andrew was knowledgable on the menu whenever we had any questions. I'm still kind of upset that they got rid of the Sante Fe Pizza, but the spicy chipotle chicken is a pretty good alternative. Good amount of heat, and they don't skimp on the meat. Mushroom sausage is a close second too. Again, the biggest difference between good and GREAT servers are the ability to make a connection with your guests and make them want to come back for more. I'll definitely be revisiting!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-beach?start=80,3.92,3.72,3.72,3.668,3.8000000000000003

We were greeted & seated right away from the employees who were very friendly and kind. The staff were very attentive and helpful with everything. We were served our drinks immediately and then were asked if we were ready to order. We got our drinks which were strawberry & mango and just a plain strawberry lemonade yet the flavor was very bitter and more sour than usual, very sour... After asking if we could get more sugar on the side, they offered to remake our drinks and were super kind about it. We just asked for sugar packs instead just so we wouldn't give them a hard time. After adjusting the drinks with the sugar, the flavor was much sweeter but it just wasn't the same as the usual house strawberry lemonade. As much as we didn't want to give them a hard time, we asked politely if we could just substitute or change our drinks. We ordered mango and strawberry ice teas and the drink was made perfectly this time around. Food wise we had ordered the chicken tequila fettucine, half bbq chicken and half pepperoni whole pizza, and a chicken Cobb salad. The food was great and we had no problems at all. To end the night, our bill was anonymously paid for! We were really in for a treat! So thankful for that kind deed!

I appreciate the other offerings they have, especially the chopped salads. So yummy. Since having moved back to this area recently,  CPK is quickly becoming a favorite again after a many year absence.  I used to work down the block from one in NorCal, and stopped going because the food was kind of bland and the service was hit or miss.  And then there was the hipster crowd.

They are freshly baked and delish! I know one is sourdough and the other is that deep-brown bread with just a hint of something sweet.

Food was cool especially when you hungry. I enjoyed that they wasn't stingy on the cheese.  Negative point is that you paying for personal pizzas at $12-16 a pie. 3 stars only cause of the service 1 star for the food tasting the way it should when fresh. 5th star missing due to the price.  You can go to Blaze or Pie-ol-ogy get any amount of toppings for $8. But go to Blaze lol ever since pieology went franchise they pizza quality went down and taste so weak and blah like cheap dough.  Sorry CPK but I always never liked your prices and only went here due to my friends choosing it. Even in the early 2000s I hated your prices.

I ordered the tortilla spring rolls which really were egg rolls. You get a sampler of any three flavors. There were three flavors to choose from: Mediterranean veggie, Thai chicken, and Baka chicken. I couldn't decide so I got one of each.  My favorite was the Thai chicken. The peanut sauce was very good, tasted like it could come from a Thai restaurant. My second would be the Baja but just because I like guacamole. My least liked would be the Mediterranean just because the cheese over powered all the veggies. It was also served with marinara sauce which is odd to me since I felt I should have been served with hummus or other sauce. It ended up tasting like a mozzarella cheese roll.  The reduced stars would mainly be from the service. It seems like waitress has forgotten about us.

My aunt ordered us the Thai Crunch salad and avocado eggrolls for appetizers. The Thai Crunch salad was very Americanized (to be expected, frankly) so it wasn't that great. I did like the avocado eggrolls, unexpectedly. It had good flavor and textures, and I would order it again if I ever decide to come back to CPK. For pizzas, we ordered their seasonally inspired sunny-side up egg and potato pizza with bacon, The Works, and the garlic chicken. My favorite of the three was the garlic chicken. The Works was subpar and the egg pizza was slightly disappointing. I feel as if the toppings on the egg pizza could have been more evenly distributed. If you have a choice though, get your pizzas with thin crust! It is so much better than their regular crust. Finally, for dessert, we had the red velvet cake and the chocolate souffle cake. I liked both but they weren't extraordinary. Overall, you can count on CPK to not have offensive food. However, if you're going to spend $20ish per person, I think you're better off going to Korean BBQ or a smaller restaurant in Costa Mesa. The food scene in this part of OC is pretty good that going to CPK should be a last resort kind of deal. Like I said, CPK is solid but not worth it frankly.

No crowds to interfere with our early dinner.   We were seated right away and Jonathan came over to explain the menu and take our drink orders.  He then gave us time to decide.  My lovely wife ordered the pot stickers appetizers and they came piping hot with a sweet sour sauce dressing.  She thought the sauce was finger licking outstanding.  She ordered a Hawaiian pizza that came out really artistically good looking.  No complaints there.   I ordered a freshly cut wedge salad with crumbly blue cheese and bacon bits and with tomato squares.  A nice start of vegetables because I knew the pepperoni and sausage and mushroom pizza would be a standalone hearty meal by itself without any greens.  The mushrooms were cut thin and sweet to taste as well as the clumps of mild Italian sausage.  The pepperoni brought some salty spicyness to the pizza.   Iced tea was replenished and Jonathan kindly boxed any leftovers for us to take home.    A good dining experience all around and I would come back in the future.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-beach?start=60,3.8,3.79,3.79,3.7,3.794

First of all, I'm not a big fan of mainstream restaurant chains. CPK, BJ's, etc...they all are not that great in my opinion. Second of all, all the food is way overpriced. Like seriously, I know food ain't cheap these days but the prices on the CPK menus were crazy expensive. Third, it was predominately Caucasian. Asians don't really spend that much money on food actually. Cheap is the way to go.  Since I had a $100 gift card, we tried to spend close to $100 as much as possible. We ended ordering three pizzas, one pasta dish, two half salads, and two drinks. I don't recall the names of the pizza but I posted the pictures on Yelp. My favorite would have to be the thin crusted pizza...it ended up being one of the cheapest dishes actually. The most expensive pizza that we ordered was the $16 one but like it honestly tasted the most basic. you could easily get that from Costco for so much cheaper haha. The salad were pretty basic too. The pasta was good but the portion was not generous at all. Cries. In the end, we pretty much spent $100 flat including tax. Yeah I don't think I will be coming back...but it was a nice fee meal hehe.

I thought ordering a steak was risky, but I thought they would treat a $26.99 steak with respect. Yeah, I was wrong. I asked for medium well. I got medium rare, well done l, and burnt, all in the same steak. Even some of the fingerling potatoes I got were undercooked. I ate around the burnt parts and was thankful for the egg rolls and bread. Our Server was nice and attentive... until they gave her a big party. I blame the Manager for the resulting bad service. A runner could have kept the drinks refilled. My Love finally had to walk to the bar to get a refill. I saw the Manager watch it happen - no apology or assistance was given (bad Manager).

Surprisingly the restaurant was fairly dead when we walked in (as was the rest of Bella Terra, it seemed). Yet from that moment, the boyfriend and I were pleasantly surprised how quick the service was given how none of the staff could have been ""in the zone"" as the restaurant had been pretty empty for the last several hours as confirmed to us by our host who sat us immediately upon us walking through the door. Not a minute after being seated our waiter was very prompt at taking our drink order and getting us some complimentary bread and dip oil. He was very attentive throughout the entire meal with refills, more complimentary bread when he saw we were done with our first round, and later, boxes and the check. It was one of the smoothest restaurant service experiences I've had in recent memory. As for the food, everything was perfect. We started with the Club Avocado Rolls which were perfectly crispy and came with more than enough dipping sauce (don't you hate it when you get a tiny cup of sauce for an entire order?). For our entrees, I decided to try something other than my old standby, the classic BBQ Chicken Pizza, and ordered the Tequila Chicken Fettucine and my BF ordered his usual, the Jambalaya Fettucine. Oh my, I believe it's going to be hard coming back to California Pizza Kitchen to get pizza after I tried the Tequila Chicken Fettucine. The pasta was perfectly al dante and the sauce was magical. Definitely getting this next time. My BF's Jambalaya Fettucine was delicious and spicy like usual and he's glad to say that he's never been disappointed with his usual order, at least at this particular location (we can't say that's been the case at other CPKs we've been to).

An entire pizza is about 1200 calories for majority of them which is high but since it's the weekend it's acceptable to me as long as I'm smart about the rest of the day.  The pizza's are large and very filling.  Donna is always trying to convince me to split a pizza and a salad but eff that...

32,Ileana B.,"Santa Ana, CA",7,7,1.0,1.0,2017-12-03,"My coworker and I have been to this particular CPK at least 4 times in the last 6 months. Every single time they never fail to disappoint us with their lack of customer service skills.  It always takes at least 5 minutes to get seated , while all the servers just stare at you.  Once you finally get seated ( it's lunch I understand it's busy) it took another 7 minutes to get greeted by our server!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-beach,2.84,3.56,3.648,,3.2720000000000002
21,Kent V.,"Huntington Beach, CA",1003,294,698.0,3.0,2017-12-04,"I haven't eaten here in forever and now I remember why. I ordered take out from here last night for 2 people. I got their Hawaiian pizza, fire roasted veggie salad (added chicken) and an order of their split pea and barely soup and potato soup. The man on the phone said that each soup is good for 1 person. Before placing my order I checked their menu on there website via phone and nothing had prices next to it so when the guy said your total is $54 I was a little taken back but figured it would be a delicious meal.  The Hawaiian pizza I received was cold and average at best. When your restaurant has pizza in the name, you figure this would be the highlight of your meal, but nope. Any pizza from a local restaurant would have been better (Valentinos, Porkys, etc.). The salad was delicious, lots of veggies including artichoke hearts, avocado, corn, etc. The grilled chicken had a lot of flavor too but when I saw the price tag at 19.99. I was taken back. This is a pretty casual restaurant, even with the chicken added it shouldn't be more than $16. The soups were good but small portions....good enough for 1 bowl for 1 person and they were both priced at 7.99. Overpriced and not worth it for the small amount and quality.  The overpriced salad was the highlight of the meal lol. The pizza did absolutely nothing for us....little toppings, dry bland crust. You're better off getting pizza and salads at any local pizza joint for 1/2 the price... now I know for next time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-beach,2.76,3.55,3.652,,3.234

26,Jenn H.,"Brea, CA",0,18,2.0,3.0,2017-12-23,Used to love this place and go all the time. Like all the time. Then they got rid of my soup. Farmers market. I am a vegetarian and it was a vegetarian soup. It was amazing. They replaced it with tomato soup. Everyone has tomato soup. How boring and unoriginal. I haven't been back since they got rid of my soup. Thumbs down. But their service is good usually. Depends on time and who you get.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-beach,2.84,3.55,3.652,,3.266
34,Tina Y.,"Fremont, CA",0,2,,5.0,2018-01-02,"Awesome Service! Our family went to the location at Huntington Beach for lunch. We ordered three pizzas, and one of them was a Margherita. We wanted chicken on the Margherita, and our waitress Alejandra was happy to help us customize the pizza. When our orders arrived, we noticed that the Margherita didn't have any chicken on it; however, we didn't mind because the pizzas were good-sized portions. Our waitress Alejandra offered to give us extra chicken on the side, but we said that it was fine. After a few minutes, Laura (possibly the store manager) came to our table and asked us if we really were fine with the pizza, and offered to bake us another pizza for us. Still, we said that we were fine, and didn't need them to bake us another pizza. A couple minutes later, Laura came out with a fresh new pizza, saying that the chef had made us another pizza at no additional cost. She then said that she took the pizza off of our bill because it wasn't perfect the first time. We never asked for anything, much less for another free pizza, yet they went above and beyond to make sure that our visit to their pizza kitchen was absolutely amazing. We got 4 pizzas for the price of 2. The customer service really was fantastic, and we will definitely go back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-beach,2.96,3.56,3.656,,3.3200000000000003
31,Adella F.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,29,2.0,2.0,2018-01-03,"This particular location is always lacking in customer service. Last time I was here, I waited for my waitress for maybe 30 minutes before I finally went to go find someone else to help me, who just so happened to be the manager. Apparently the waitress was feeling ill and for some reason they did not let anyone else know that she had customers waiting. Ok? Now today, my waitress brings bread for the table right next to me, but so happened to forget mine. Do yourself a favor and head to fashion island (I usually never say that,) but that location always has excellent service. Bella Terra needs to get it's act together!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-beach,2.88,3.53,3.648,,3.27
