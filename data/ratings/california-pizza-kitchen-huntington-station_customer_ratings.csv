He loves their cobb salad, which has generous amounts of avocado, and I always try and have something new each time. I have loved every pizza I've tried from them, and am a fan of their ravioli as well. Another perk about this place is all of the fun non-alcoholic drinks, as I am not a big drinker. They have Italian sodas, cherry limeaid, a cranberry juice cocktail, and another delicious fruit juice cocktail!

14,Dominic L.,"Westbury, NY",14,86,271.0,2.0,2012-12-11,Food is ok. But this location had some major set backs. First the waiter comes to take your order without writing the order down.  Need less to say he got one of our order wrong. We kept it since didnt want to wait for another order which will take forever.  So the waiter drops off the food.  But does not come back to check on us.  We absolutely waited forever for him to come back.   During dinner we went to the men's room to do number one.  We notice one of the waiter had just did number one and jetted out so quick Without washing his hands. That is so gross! Totally UNSANITARY.  My kids ordered a sundae and the waiter gave my kids the sundae in a kids cup. I would recommend you to go to another cpk.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-station?start=40,2.568,2.568,2.568,2.568,2.5680000000000005

While the location has a nice appeal , including some smooth jazz playing in the background, the food is lackluster.  I went with a best friend because we were right there and we needed food pronto after passing that window from hungry to ravenous! Service was fine but a bit harried.  We started with panko-breaded mac and cheese bites. Decently crispy, zero seasoning, frozen standard mac & cheese.  Eh!  My entrée was a Chipolte chicken pizza.  It was topped with a black bean salsa.  That was decent.  The scant chicken and the guacamole-type cream that were also on it, not so much.  It was a straight-up frozen crust, no bones about it.  My friend had a salad that she said was pretty good but it was quite skimpy.  All in all, it was okay.  I have no remote desire to return again.  There was also a notation on the menu saying something about bread basket available upon request? What's up with that noise? lol  Put out some welcoming eats and maybe folks want to stay, no? I mean, its okay not to have a basket, but either deliver on it or don't !!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-station?start=60,2.6000000000000005,2.6000000000000005,2.6000000000000005,2.6000000000000005,2.6000000000000005

16,Andrea C.,"Huntington Station, NY",72,45,82.0,2.0,2013-05-15,"While I haven't been here in a while, I have been here many times before and happy with their food and service. Unfortunately I cannot say the same about tonight's experience. It started off on the wrong foot when the waiter Joe suggested a caffeinated tea when my friend specifically asked for decaf.  Our food order was simple - 2 cups of the split pea barley soup, an arugula asparagus salad, roasted veggie salad with shrimp and a side order of pita bread that we requested to come out with the soup. Maybe that was too much to ask for as we had to remind the waiter about the pita bread and then send it back because it wasn't fully cooked.  The middle/inside tasted and actually looked slightly raw.  In fact, it also tasted different - more like pizza dough cut into triangles. We asked for it to be cooked more and while it did come back a bit more browned it still tasted and looked slightly under cooked - like raw dough.  Moving on to what I thought was a simple salad order.  I asked for my salad dressing on the side. And while they did give me salad dressing in a dish on the side, the cook must have slipped and put the salad dressing on before realizing I requested it on the side.  I saw some lettuce leaves with dressing on it but figured they started to put the dressing on then stopped. From first appearance the salad did not look like it had dressing.  However, when I mixed it up there was already dressing on the under layer.  But it didn't end there. When we were done I asked for a container to take home the food that we didn't finish and Joe only brings 1 container for 2 items. Common sense would tell me to bring 2 containers or at least ask how many containers I needed.  Definitely not assume I'd put the 2 items together. Needless to say I was very disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-huntington-station?start=40,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006

Recommended only if you like unsanitary flies buzzing around you and staff that's just going through the motions (translation = maybe go somewhere else). We went for lunch today and were seated in a corner booth. We eventually realized the area had many banana flies, which kept landing on our food (yum, protein? methinksnot.) There was also one large fly that kept landing on us throughout the entire meal. Midway through, we asked very nicely if someone might be able to catch this fly with a wet towel/napkin, which was chilling on the window. Ten minutes later, we get a message through our waitress from the manager: ""The only thing we can do is spray pesticides here while you eat, otherwise...."" Ok, thanks but no thanks, Mr. or Ms. Obnoxious. No apology, no offer to move us to another table. Everything was taking WAY too long, so we just wrapped up and left.

We were just here last night, so I think I can accurately describe this... My husband really likes the Mac and Cheese Bites. It's his thing. It's a $3.50 +\- plate of four bites, and they're pretty tasty. They were hot, with a crispy outside, and a yummy inside. My thing is the avocado club egg rolls. I really like avocado, and I really like avocado, chicken, bacon, tomato, and maybe other delicious food stuff wrapped in a crispy egg roll wrapper and dipped in ranch dressing with a hint of hot sauce.  We tried the artichoke and spinach pizza last night. It was good, we liked it. We also like the California club pizza. We usually have good service, and we did last night though the place was packed.

They have whole wheat and gluten free options, as well as fun and unique menu items, such as chile roleno, tortilla spring rolls, and thai pizza.  Good: I recommend the avocado egg rolls, the lettuce wraps, and the jamaican jerk pizza (or really any pizza for that matter). Drinks are good and you can get a bottle of wine for the table (or yourself). Not-so-good: The crispy mac and cheese wasn't warm OR gooey on the inside. (Whaaaaaattt?)

There must have been 20 pieces.  I don't think 20 pieces of edamame would be good for anyone but this is not a nutrition review or article about the Dark Side of Soy.  I see now on the menu it doesn't mention edamame , they should mention it on the menu.  It tasted ok, the peanuts and dressing were tasty.  My boyfriend enjoyed his turkey sandwich.  Coffee was good.

Chile sauce was nice however.  Probably mostly corn syrup.   The quesedillas were not something that I would order again. I would rather not go on. The spicy mayo accompanying the appetizer was very well balanced, definitely would be great with fries. The kids pizza was brought out almost room temperature.  The bottom appeared as if not baked? It was consumed rapidly by a 7 year old child. Arugula salad was fresh and certainly the best thing we ate. some ribboned parmesan was a nice touch. The Thai chicken pizza, our reason for visiting in the first place, was an extreme letdown. Years back you had thinly julienned veggies on top of the chicken and peanut sauced dough. Now it is basically twice as thick cut on the veggies,   ice cold, on top of a meagerly acessorized dough/crust. The great peanut flavor is there,  just skimped.

64,Ky A.,"Bay Shore, NY",46,50,10.0,2.0,2016-09-19,"Dined here this past Saturday night around 7:30 to get a quick bite and Sat at the bar because my boyfriend wanted to watch the Mets game on their TV. However a football game was on and when the bartender asked the manager if the tv could be changed my boyfriend said the manager rolled his eyes. Never got changed but it's okay because it's not a sports bar. The bartender was very busy but served us right away. Both ordered the sangria flights, which was pretty good. We then started off with a Caesar salad. Since the bartender was busy I asked the to-go worker for black pepper. He looked at me confused and said ""black pepper?"" I'll go check if we have some. He came back and said they had no pepper but they had red crushed pepper if I wanted that. Ummm no, but I know the restaurant has black pepper because it is a basic seasoning and necessity. Thankfully the table behind us was open so we took the pepper that was on it.  I ended up getting the roasted garlic chicken pizza and my other half got the chipotle chicken. Mines was definitely better!  While eating, we also had a lot of entertainment to watch from the employees. They were fighting with each other, making snarky comments and complaining. I've worked in the restaurant industry and if you have an open kitchen DO NOT air your problems out in front of patrons! Very unprofessional, but kind of entertaining. The people next to us was also watching the show and made their stay very short.  However, the worst part is this woman comes in with her kid who is about 5 or 6. They ordered to go but ended up staying and was about to sit at a table when her child started to cry and fuss. So what happened? They ended up sitting at the bar right next to me!! Then 3 young teens around 13-14 sat at the end of the bar! Not accompanied by an adult. I believe in NY if a person is less than 16 yo they need to be accompanied by an adult. It's not like I dislike kids, but come on kids sitting at a bar? Not what I wanted. The manager passed them a few times and didn't say anything, so I guess he didn't see it as a problem. This is putting the bartender at risk! This establishment should not allow kids to sit at a bar, especially when tables are open. Just looks unprofessional, so when we finally left the bar was filled with the 3 young teens, the 5 year old and his mother. Haha a bar filled with kids how about that? I've been to other family restaurants where a kid would sit at the bar with his parents and the manager would politely ask them to sit at a table instead since the child is a minor.

I would like to be warmly greeted but I had to say hello first. Not that I have a problem with that but it seemed he wanted to know why I was there without asking me. I would like to be seated please. He was a kid so I don't place blame on his inexperience in customer service. However, I do expect his managers to teach him how to greet a customer.  Secondly, while the restaurant had a lot of customers there were more than a few open tables, but we were seated at the table with direct sunlight in your eyes. The blinds facing that table were broken. He left immediately before I could address the issue. I simply sat at the next table. While I was waiting 10 mins for someone, anyone to introduce themselves as my server, this host tried to seat two other groups at that table. Clearly the worst seat in the house.  Ten minutes after being seated I was finally introduced to my server. He apologized for the wait of course. Obviously not his fault. While those around us may have been slowly helped before us, they clearly were waiting a while too. Slowly the water came, then the bread, then the chips and guacamole. Finally a bowl of soup came out. But it wasn't until I was too exhausted to wait for my pizza. I asked 40 minutes after waiting for my entree to have it wrapped to go. 10 minutes later and I finally got the check and my pizza.
