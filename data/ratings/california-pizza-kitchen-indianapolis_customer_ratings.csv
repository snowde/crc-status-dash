49,Sunah K.,"Indianapolis, IN",30,163,98.0,3.0,2012-01-12,"yeah it's another chain restaurant in the mall, but it's pretty convenient, decent food, although the service is ht or miss.  i've been twice since they opened--first just a few days after  they opened--it was not very busy for a weekend evening.  we started with the korean beef taco appetizers--i'm biased cuz I'm Korean, but i didn't think they were particularly special, or Korean.  Our main orders somehow got lost amongst the few other restaurant orders, so after waiting for about 1/2 an hour after our apps, they brought us out another order of tacos, which were no better than the first. Their pizzas, of course are good--i almost always get the original bbq chicken, but i've had several of their others.   The next time we went, we were kind of in a hurry. it was definitely busier, with a few couples waiting in front to be seated, but there were at least half a dozen empty tables, all dirty, beng slowly cleared by what seemed to be the only bus person on duty. I'll probably eat there again if i'm at the mall, but it's not worth more than 3 stars",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-indianapolis?start=40,3.0840000000000005,3.0840000000000005,3.0840000000000005,3.0840000000000005,3.0840000000000005

42,Mark B.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,4,5.0,3.0,2012-02-08,"If you get the Crispy Mac n' Cheese, you've already set yourself up for a good experience.  The waiter talked us into ordering the small-portioned albeit delectable appetizer after ordering both the Margherita and White pizzas -- and let's face it, he didn't have to try that hard. The Mac n' Cheese was brought to our table alongside our additional house salads which, too, were surprisingly crisp and refreshing. However, they were only a side note to the bursting flavor of the Crispy Mac n' Cheese.  I consider myself a 'texture' person when it comes to food so I was quite satisfied with the crispness of the outer shell especially when most restaurants with a similar menu item tend to lean toward the soggy side. But that's not all - the mac n' cheese inside the shell was some of the creamiest, richest, and moistest (yes - I hate this word) mac n' cheese I've ever had. The only downside is the portion size which turns out to be only 4 bite-size nuggets. If you're hungry, order two servings (we didn't have any hangups since we ordered two pizzas for our table). It would be nice if CPK increased the portion size to at least 5 bites, but I'm just nitpicking at this point. Now on to the pizza. Again, we ordered the White and the Margherita pizzas and both were good. As far as I'm concerned, I've had better 'white' pizzas from Domino's and Hot Box (The Big Cheese is the same thing in my book), but CPK's was good enough. I probably wouldn't order it again due to the outstanding menu choices which I also deem to be one of this restaurant's strengths, but my focus remained on the Mac n' Cheese (did I already mention that I liked the Mac n' Cheese?) AND the Margherita pizza. In the realm of Margherita pizzas, this was hands down one of the best I've ever had. It's thin-crusted, light and airy with the perfect blend of mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses that penetrate all the way down to the crust. I liken this pizza to a can of Pringles; once I popped (a slice into my mouth), I just couldn't stop (popping more and more slices). I highly recommend this pizza and if you are adamant about smothering your pizza in cheese, you might want to order extra or something else altogether. I'll finish with the atmosphere. As most people are already aware, this used to be Alcatraz - a fancy(ish) Brewhouse located inside/outside of the Circle Centre Mall. In my opinion, it doesn't quite fit into my normal expectation for a 'pizza place.' I felt that it was obvious that it used to be occupied by another restaurant and it definitely didn't have that welcome-to-our-extended-family vibe that most sit-in pizza places have. I sort of felt out of place when ordering JUST pizza as if I should've ordered shrimp cocktail for an appetizer, but once again I'm only nitpicking. Our waiter was superb and I never had to wait for a refill. The bathroom was quite dirty during my visit. I don't know if this had to do with the fact that it was the day after the Super Bowl, but the place was pretty dead so I'm going to chalk this one up to laziness.  Overall, if I'm in the area and have a taste for pizza, I'll probably go back... that's if I'm not drinking and closer to Hot Box down the street.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-indianapolis?start=40,3.1800000000000006,3.1800000000000006,3.1800000000000006,3.1800000000000006,3.1800000000000006
6,Julia C.,"Indianapolis, IN",158,194,263.0,4.0,2012-03-10,"So the secret is to wish for everything you miss from home and presto it's appears. I use to go to CPK a lot with my peeps when I was back home (California) mainly to the bar for a quick drink and appetizer before heading out to the clubs (err, or club, as Monterey does not have very many :P). The one that opened at Circle center is VERY small, but still very much the same as any other CPK I've been too (duh, chain).  We went there on a Thursday  at around 2:30pm and it was pretty much dead in there. Not that many people in the mall either (omg, people actually work? :P), just a few suits and a couple with a baby. Our waiter was very funny and suggested we get the Korean BBQ steak tacos as an appetizer. It was pretty good, but I think my momma could whip up some better bulgogi to throw in there. I wish there was a Kogi BBQ-to-go truck here in Indy. But I digress, the tacos were very good, but it was just a hint of Korean flavors in it. We also ordered Jamaican Jerk chicken & the White pizza. MMMmmmm, bacon! I'm so going to miss you when I got veg. Dillon was worried that the pizzas were small and would not fill him up as he can put away at least 2 large pizzas from Papa Johns--or even 2 16' pizzas from Bazbeaux. But he started to feel full after a few slices. I think it's all the favors in the pizzas or maybe we waited too long before eating that day.  Overall, happy there is a CPK in town. It's a little overpriced, but really flavorful pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-indianapolis,3.248,3.248,3.248,3.248,3.248

We were immediately sat and our order was taken right away....by what seemed to be a really awesome server.  Yet, he took our order and we didn't see him again until we needed boxes and our check.  Someone else brought our food.  We got our salads after our pizza.  No one ever asked how we were doing or how our food was.  We NEVER got a refill on drinks.  In fact, we stopped eating, because we needed refills and couldn't take another bite without one.  We flagged down random servers asking for a refill on our drinks.  Never got one.  Finally, one of my coworkers walked inside to complain and even though she was extremely nice and understanding while she was ""complaining"", the Manager told her, ""I don't know what to tell you.  We are busy.""   Completely unacceptable response.  Period.  It was not that busy.....and if you cannot handle refills on drinks during a semi-busy lunch hour...or even getting a salad out before a meal, can't you at least apologize for it??   I may still go back.  The food was really good.  I just wish the service had been better.  I rarely EVER leave a bad tip (as I worked several years in the service industry), but I couldn't help myself that day.  I felt like we didn't even have a server.

22,Bill J.,"Indianapolis, IN",101,422,57.0,4.0,2012-08-15,"I went to CPK yesterday for a business lunch (client's choice) and was pleasantly surprised.  I had not been to CPK in a long, long time and I think the last time I went it might have been in an airport (?). Hostess greeted us immediately after we walked in, asked if we preferred a table or a booth.  Nice.  I like choices.  I really like a booth for a casual meal; comfort factor is superior. Server was at our table almost immediately for drink orders.  Delivered drinks quickly and took our order efficiently.  I ordered the Pear & Gorgonzola pizza....definitely a different tasting kind of pizza, but different in a good way.  The pizza is served with a mixed greens salad on top of it (placed on top *after* the pizza is baked).  So basically you're getting a side salad and pizza for lunch.   All in all it made for a very light lunch and it was very well prepared.  The server did a nice job of staying in touch with us but not interrupting our business discussion. The restaurant was not at all crowded during lunch hour yesterday....a little surprising given the location, but just an observation. I would definitely go back here and would not feel ""bad"" because it's a chain.  If the food and the service are good, then why not?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-indianapolis?start=20,3.152,3.152,3.152,3.152,3.152

Then an actual old veteran had to wait 8 minutes for a dang coke. The pizza was decent but how dirty the plates and cups were ruined it all. It was not a fun experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-indianapolis?start=20,3.52,3.52,3.52,,3.5200000000000005
37,K S.,"Morrisville, NC",0,6,,2.0,2014-11-18,"Went on a Friday night.  The place was busy, but not overly crowded.  We were seated near the kitchen.  The manager was friendly, but there was way too much horsing around with the wait staff and kitchen staff.  We heard complaints from the wait staff to each other, and the manager was discussing the employee schedule with one of the waiters right beside our table.  This stuff needs to happen in the back, not out with the customers.  The food- overpriced for what it is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-indianapolis?start=20,3.48,3.48,3.48,,3.4800000000000004

There is very seldom a wait of any kind and the food is always delicious. They have a very large menu with a nice variety, many other options besides pizza. The price is very reasonable as well. I enjoy bringing people here who are not very food adventurous. People can almost always find something they like. Plus they have a full bar.

Come to think of it, I'm not sure if they have a thin crust pizza or if I've never thought to ask. If you like big dough, this is a good choice of a place to eat a personal size pie. I really like the grilled veggie salad, adding shrimp, but that makes it pretty spendy. I think this is mostly for the convention crowd, so they have some chains they recognize. I think the locals are probably still heading for Bazbeaux or Pizzology.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-indianapolis,3.4,3.4,3.4,,3.4000000000000004

There was some staff confusion about applying discounts from their rewards program. Bread that was ordered online was left out until I checked the order and requested it again. Finally, when I got to my hotel, I found that the asparagus and arugula salad had been made with peanuts rather than almonds. Not a major issue for me, but I would not recommend this CPK for anyone in a hurry or with food allergy concerns...not a lot of attention to detail here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-indianapolis?start=20,3.44,3.44,3.44,,3.4400000000000004

8,Tina B.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,6,,2.0,2015-07-02,"I was not super impressed with my recent visit to CPK. The hostess was seating us in the bar when the bartender walked by and asked her not to seat him because he was swamped. Pretty awkward considering she sat us in the bar anyway. It didn't exactly scream Customer Service. She also told us to watch out for a drink that had been spilled right next to our table. No wet floor sign, no attempt by anyone throughout our entire meal to clean it up. The other servers were standing in groups by the drink station or at the front, and the manager was even standing at the front looking like he wasn't doing anything. Meanwhile, the poor bartender was taking a full bar while making everyone else's drinks, running food, and bussing his tables. He still did a great job, especially since he was getting no help from anyone. If I were a lower class of person, I would have ""slipped"" in the spilled drink and collected a nice check. Instead I just ate some pizza, tipped the bartender for his hard work, and left.

18,Aaron J.,"Greenwood, IN",0,7,,1.0,2015-07-07,"I've dined at this resturant a number of times, and most experiences have been good.  That said, I have one friend that refuses to eat here because she found a roach in her take-home box when opening it to put pizza in, but that's a different review that she can write if she decides to do so.  My most recent visit this pas weekend, left much to be desired. There was a lot of stuff going on downtown and due to it being a holiday weekend, they were short staffed.  There were 15+ empty tables as they were only seating about 1/2 the resturant.  They should probably seated even less.  We waited 30+ minutes to get a seat.   After being seated, we waited probably 15 minutes before someone greeted us to take drink orders.  At that time, it wasn't even the waitress that took the drink order, it was someone else. We ordered some soft drinks, and a drink from the bar.  Since he was underage, he wasn't able to take the order for the bar, so we had to wait for the waitress.   5 minutes later, the waitress showed up with the first set of drinks, and to take the bar order.  Despite being ready with our food order, she wouldn't take our food order. 20 minutes later, she returns to take our food order.  My drink from the bar had still not been delivered. She went to the bar, picked it up, and brought it over...it was wrong.  She took our food order and took the drink back to be fixed.   Probably another 20 minutes later, the food showed up, but my drink had not...so she went back to the bar to get it.  It looked mostly correct this time, however, it appeared they had just taken the old drink, and dumped it into a new glass, and added what was missing.  There wasn't much ice, and it looked watered down...which it was.  I just wanted to eat at this point so I didn't make a big deal about it.  After tasting it,I found it to be flat, and it tasted as if it was made with club soda instead of tonic.  Again, I just wanted to eat, so I drank it as-is. She did check back and see how the food was and get refills on the soft drinks a few minutes later. At the end of the meal, I requested the check.  They had charged me $17.58 for the drink.  A bit frustrated, I called the waitress back, explained that I had waited a long time for it, and that it wasn't of good quality.  I thought that for the inconvenience, that they should take at least half off that.  She took it to the bar, returned a few minutes later saying that they were unable to reduce the price on alcohol, but they could take something off of the price on the pizza.  I told them that I didn't care what they did, that I was going to leave it in their hands to do what they're allowed to do to make it right.  She returned saying that they had taken $2.86 off, 10% of the food cost. Understanding everthing that had happened, the pittance of a discount that they gave me just wasn't acceptable in my mind.  Poor dining room service, poor customer service...but I can't knock the food...it was decent...hence the 1 star.  Sorry CPK, I won't be back there for a long time...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-indianapolis,3.08,3.08,3.08,,3.0800000000000005

I was incredibly disappointed in how long it took for this place to bring me my drink order. I was very nearly tempted to leave without it as it was taking far too long. A frozen lemonade shouldn't take over half an hour or longer to be delivered to my table after being ordered, especially after every other person at our table had received their drink orders.  The restaurant wasn't terribly busy when we visited. The tables were nice and clean and the venue was reasonably well lit.
