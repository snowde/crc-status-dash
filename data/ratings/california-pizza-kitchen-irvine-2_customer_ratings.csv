As you can read via my previous ""critique,"" they lack a certain finesse when delivering carry-out. Any which way, this time around it was actually delicious.

The Good: The service from our waiter Phillip was excellent, it was excellent to the point that we had to end the lunch early in fear that the tip would have been more than the meals combined.  The Bad: Bought myself the fan-favorite ""Sicilian Pizza"" but overall it was nothing special that would make one come back for seconds. Frankly the pizza tastes like the average Digiorno that came from the freezer and was warmed up in their ""brick pizza oven"" AKA microwave oven.

Last time I went here with a group of friends and we were seated in the outside patio area. First, our waitress didn't come to our table for at least 10 minutes. When she finally came, she took our drink orders and disappeared for another 10 or 15 minutes. Eventually she returned with our drinks and promised to bring us some bread for the table... but the bread didn't come until after we got our entrees (we had to remind her again.) To top it off, the salad she claimed she'd bring out before the entrees never actually came until I asked for it -- I didn't even get to ask our actual waitress because she disappeared, I had to ask whatever random person was there delivering our entrees. To recap: we got our bread and salad after our entrees even though we asked several times for both. What? Almost all my trips here have been similar.

Back in the day CPK was the place to grab dinner before a movie and go on cute little dates with your high school boyfriends. Now that I'm older, I rarely go to CPK.  I think CPK needs a major upgrade if it wants to stay competitive with the other restaurants starting to pop up everywhere. The food tastes alright. Complimentary bread and butter is always nice.

68,Kelsey L.,"Irvine, CA",28,82,30.0,2.0,2012-04-21,"I had been to a California Pizza Kitchen twice several years ago. I saw in a Vegan iPod reference app I use that there were some items that work for a vegan, so I was curious and wanted to give them a try again today.  It's just... bland. Reminded me of a Denny's or restaurant in a cheap hotel. Lots of loud kids, families. My overall impression is that this is the place you settle on when you're at the mall, need to please everyone, and are tired of hearing your kids whine. Not good. The food was, well... ok. I got a vegetarian pizza (w/o cheese) and it was decently tasty. The choice to put big chunks of baby broccoli, one per slice, made it look pretty... but be very awkward to eat. That seems pretty dumb to me. The prices aren't at all great for what you're getting. My husband and I each got a pizza, we drank water, and the bill was a little over $30 after tip. Not at all worth the money. Also, my husband and I felt super awkward every time our waiter came by - he kept trying to make these bad jokes/little comments that seemed like they might have been scripted. It was just... uncomfortable.  My curiosity is sated and I won't be back to this or any other CPK.

The menu was again, altered with essentially the same items with just different crusts; mushroom pizza, mushroom sausage pepperoni pizza...it goes on and on. They have added entrees, appetizers and small plates but it has really gotten away from its signature items, pizza. All of the unique ones you won't find anywhere else are gone. It's just not special anymore or certainly doesn't have a unique appeal. The kids meals are fine overall. We probably would not go back and try something else in the mall.

Cons: - It is COLD in this restaurant if you sit inside.  Probably 65 degrees. - The quinoa/arugala salad is a little bland in both taste and appearance. Ask for some lemon wedges to give it some zing. - They've gotten a little lazy with the free bread/butter.  The bread was essentially lacking in all flavor and texture and had too much loose flour on the outside.

While the food is of course decent, it's not great and is just a little too spendy. It's been a couple years since I've been to a CPK and noticed some good changes they've made since. First, their complimentary bread and olive oil is excellent. The bread is warm, fresh, crackly outside and soft inside.  They also changed their pizza making process so that every pie is hand formed, as opposed to a machine they used before to form the crust. While the effort to move in a direction that's more artisinal is certainly appreciated, their energy could've been better spent having changed their crust recipe altogether to make it more crispy and less chewy, like something you'd find at Pizzeria Mozza.

238,Amar B.,"Las Vegas, NV",62,29,126.0,4.0,2013-07-08,"You might be wondering why I gave CPK 4/5 stars. Sounds crazy right? Well let me explain... this wasn't my first time coming to CPK, I can say I've been here enough to have tried most of their menu. I've been to CPKs in Nevada, Cali, and Arizona and its pretty much the same rodeo everywhere you go. This CPK was no different in delivering the brand promise, I got exactly what I was expecting to get; a marginally better dining experience at a reasonable price.  I came with a party of 8 on a Sunday for lunch, called ahead 15 minutes and our table was ready as we arrive. Once we were seated the server was friendly but not overly inviting, we ordered the spicy chicken quesadillas for our appetizers. They definitely did not disappoint, the quesadillas were bite sized, filled with black beans, roasted peppers, Monterey jack, onions, and chicken, and they were served with a creamy ranchito sauce. The spicy chicken quesadillas are definitely one of their more tasteful appetizer, and my personal favorite. The flavor and quality of ingredients was spot on with many of the other CPKs I've patroned. For my main course I ordered the California Club with Cesar Salad, which is again one of my personal favorite. The sandwich comes with delicious and crunchy bacon bits, avocado, grilled chicken, and tomatoes on herb onion bread. The sandwich is a great healthy alternative with plenty of flavor! Not only was the sandwich great but the Cesar Salad was equally as great. My entire entrée did not disappoint, it had neither disappointed nor exceeded my expectations, and rather it met them right in the middle. As far as presentation, plating, flavor, and ingredient quality are concerned I got exactly what I was expecting to get. One of the great things about this visit was the speed of the kitchen. We received our appetizers roughly 20 minutes after being seated and our main courses followed a couple minutes later; just as we were finishing up our appetizers, to be exact. Although I would have liked a break between the two courses I had no problem with the fast service of the kitchen. Overall, the service wasn't terrible 4/5, atmosphere was 3/5, and food quality was 5/5 (based on brand promise and my expectations), If I'm ever craving CPK again and I happen to be in the area I know I'll get exactly what I want if I come here... I will definitely be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine-2?start=140,3.2,3.02,3.02,2.576,3.0920000000000005

I got the BBQ Pizza.  There are about 6 or so slices and it's definitely enough for one person.  The crust was fairly chewy, the end crusty and a perfect amount of ingredients on the top.  I finished it easily. My only gripe is I wish they had a few more ""gourmet"" pizza options if you know what I mean. Yeah, they have that thai pizza and their thin crust pizzas offer the pear and gorgonzola but I was looking for like a prosciutto pizza or a white pizza without tomato sauce etc.   Again, for a standard pizza place this definitely deserves a solid 3 stars.

110,Irvine K.,"Irvine, CA",73,4,,5.0,2013-07-13,"To get the review up to speed real quick, my GF and I love CPK's food so that is easily a 4 star rating. Good mix of flavors and pricing is always right.  Whats makes this a 5 star is Arash. He was our bartender/waiter while we were at the bar and I could not begin to explain the amount of fun we had with him.  To start our night we found out P.F. Changs was going to be a 50 min wait on a friday night at 8 pm (no surprise really) so we decided to go to CPK for some good drinks and food. We were told there would be a 30 min wait but the bar was full service and had 2 seats open. That was like a guiding light from above tellin us where to sit for the good time we were looking to have.  My GF ordered a Appleberry Sangria (which was delicious simply because of the bar tending skills of Arash) and I was torn what to get so we ended up ordering a couple (which in reality was 2; 4 before we ordered our Hawaiian BBQ Chicken pizza on Honey-wheat dough) appetizers while I made up my mind. i settled on a Mai Tai and once again in Arash's superior bar tending skills, it was easily the best Mai Tai I have ever had (very tough category when you have one from Billy's at the Beach in Newport Beach). During the time of us enjoying our appetizers we were extremely entertained not only by Arash's wonderful personality but by him working the bar and mixing drinks for other customers of the restaurant.  By the time by my GF was halfway done with her drink, I was ready for another. Naturally I gave Arash carte blanche on my next drink with Vodka. After letting me choose which vodka I wanted, he contemplated what to make me. Shortly thereafter a wonderfully pink looking drink was born and in a pint glass in front of me (granted I do not shy away from girly drinks). Not only was it delicious but it was strong (it was a Cosmo for those wondering).  After those drinks and the food we were not only extremely satisfied but Arash pulled out some great bar tricks that left us laughing and amazed.  Arash was easily the contributing factor to us staying there for over 2 hours. Not only entertaining but his serving was top notch.  Not in my 23 years have I encountered a better waiter/waitress at a restaurant where they really make you feel like close friends from start to finish.

197,Clara C.,"Irvine, CA",2019,776,2655.0,4.0,2013-10-24,"CPK has really improved in the last couple years.  I used to think their pizzas were really mediocre and pastas too oily or too heavy. When I came here on a Wednesday night, I didn't think it was too bad!  The hostess/waitress greeted us at the entrance and was very helpful with my question about their ongoing promotion: with any dinner entree, buy a Regal (just across the walkway) ticket for $8 + tax.  They are offering it year-round, and you don't have to redeem it right away.  The service was great.  Ashli came to our table many times to check up on us, even though she was obviously very busy (and she stated she was pretty new).  I was sharing food with my bf, and although I forgot to ask for an extra plate, she offered to bring one.  We had an offer from our mobile app, and she remembered to put it in the check.  I really appreciated that she got our bill right the first time.  (I find it pretty annoying when I am billed incorrectly and they make us wait while they fix it.) I had half of the Cobb Pizza ($13).  I ordered this since it was a CPK favorite, denoted by the palm tree symbol on the menu.  Although everything on the pizza was fantastic, my bf didn't like that he was practically eating a salad on top of the pizza.  The avocado and lettuce toppings are placed pretty much like a salad, so it gets really messy (they add light dressing as well).  It helps if you fold the pizza slice..  Anyway, the taste was great.  In addition to the marinara, you also get a bit of the ranch dressing, and it was not heavy at all. (If you've never dipped pizza into ranch, you gotta try it!!)  The cobb pizza was on the hand-tossed original crust (not the thin crust), which apparently is made with less sugar than before.  I thought the crust was pretty good - chewy, soft in the center, yet crispy/lightly toasted. They have a separate ""small plates"" (aka appetizer) menu that offered smaller portions at lower prices.  You could order flatbreads, salads, and other appetizers.  I think it's great for snacking before or after a movie!  I had the asparagus + arugula salad ($4.95).  It was enough to fill me as a late night snack, but I don't think the portion was large enough to call it a dinner.  The light vinaigrette tasted great - I love arugula, too.  The salad also had sun-dried tomatoes and even fewer pieces of full almonds.  I really enjoyed the small salad.  Just be careful with asparagus because it really does stink your pee.   I also tried the chips & guac ($3.85); there was way too much chips for the amount of guac they provided.  The guac had chunky pieces of avocado and too much corn for my taste.  This appetizer was good, but I wish there was more guac!  Portion size wasn't too bad for 4 bucks. There's also Pieology at the Irvine Spectrum.  The only reason I'd choose CPK over Pieology would be variety - if I wanted some salad, dessert, or pasta.  I'll have to come back to try out their pastas.  I think Pieology pizzas would be comparable to CPK's thin-crust pizzas.  I'd say CPK's is just a tiny bit bigger in diameter, but Pieology is still cheaper for a custom pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine-2?start=100,3.16,2.99,2.99,2.416,3.0580000000000007

Since they've redone their spectrum location, I feel their service has taken a huge toll. Our host seemed like he had a huge ego, who kept butting into our conversation as we were being seated. Our waiter, Kyle, had terrible timing and was too assuming. I ordered wine and it naturally comes in a separate glass so I can pour at my own pace. Apparently I wasn't drinking fast enough because he came by and just poured the other half in so he could clear some dishes off the table. WTF? He also forgot to add avocado to our salad, and when another server came out with it, we simply asked if the salad had avocado or if it was too much to add at that point. She seemed like she was irritated and said pretty loudly in her extremely annoying voice ""For $4 we can add it..."" with a little bit of attitude in her voice. $4? Really chick, you all forgot the avocado, and you can't even be nice about it. What a bitch. Like, seriously I felt like I had just asked her to kiss my feet. All this for avocado that we were willing to pay for anyways, but attitude did not help.  While we were finishing up, Kyle brought the check by and cleared the salad that still had a quarter left on the plate, and I was still eating! I couldn't even say anything because my mouth was full of pizza, and he was so quick to clear it. By the time I could say anything, he had already placed other dirty dishes on top of our salad. So rude, and too assuming-- as in he thought he knew what was best for us.  Anyways, the thing that killed me was that after we paid and were getting ready to leave, Kyle had just taken the drink order of a mature couple next to us. The gentleman said to his wife ""I DO NOT LIKE THIS GUY"", and when she kind of blew it off, he said it again, ""No, I do NOT like this guy."" Haha!  This is only one example of the service here, but I have been here plenty of times since the remodel and have noticed this terrible service every time. Next time, I'm just ordering food togo.

However, the last few visits I've had at this particular location, the service has been on the slower side. Granted, I understand during high peak hours such as your typical lunch hour and dinner rush, it can get pretty crowded and you can expect slower service. But the last few times I've been here it's been off peak hours and the restaurant wasn't very busy. The other night we were seated, but it took about 15 minutes before someone took our drink orders. Typically, you get your drink orders taken within the first 5 minutes of getting seated. But whatever...that's the service I've been getting. Overall, the food can be pretty tasty. It's a chain, so it's a good place to keep in mind if you're in a city unknown to you and all you run into is a CPK. You can be assured, there will be something on the menu that should satisfy your palate. Obviously they have pizza and obviously they have these in California! LOL Here are a few of my favorites: BBQ CHICKEN PIZZA: It has chicken, cheese, cilantro, red onions on a thin crust Pizza. Maybe not your ""traditional"" Italian Pizza...but maybe that's why it's ""California Pizza Kitchen."" We Californians like to give traditional foods a twist and make it look pretty upon presentation. BBQ CHICKEN SALAD:  There's usually more iceberg though which I consider more of a filler than adding any nutritional value, so depending on my mood, I'll have them add spinach. They have lunch portion or full portion. Depending on your appetite, choose one or the other.  CARAMELIZED PEACH SALAD: This is my new favorite. I typically don't like much fruit in my salad, but this is tasty! Warm peach on a bed of greens joined by dried cranberries, red onions, toasted pecans and Gorgonzola cheese!?! It's like your taste buds are all satisfied with the sweetness, the nuts and the tart taste of the Gorgonzola cheese! COMPLIMENTARY BREAD: I don't know when they changed it, but they now have a spiced up dipping oil and a different type of bread they serve complimentary. I'm not too familiar with the different kinds of bread, but what used to be a simple white bread is now more of a ciabatta type. But that's not my point...I'm really excited about the dipping oil. It's got parsely, oregano, thyme, chili flakes and salt. A lot tastier than your average olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  So yeah, that's my review.

I ordered the California Club pizza and split it with one of my friends, since it was a fairly good portion size. It tasted almost like if you got a chicken pizza and then just threw part of a salad on top. Reading the description in the menu, I was under the impression that all of the ingredients would be baked into the pizza; however that wasn't the case as the veggies were fresh and uncooked.

And if that wasn't enough, to add insult to injury, as the party walked up to the podium the hostess asked them if they wanted inside seating or THE PATIO! Really? There was a second hostess that had just came to the podium, so my wife walked up and explained that we were before the last two parties to be seated, but there really wasn't much response. My wife turned and looked at me in disbelief, so I told her that we just needed to leave. So she turned to the hostess and asked that our name be taken off the list. With out a single word even being spoken, she picked up her writing utensil and scratched off our name.  We just turned and walked out.

An associate and I were working on a case and had no time to dine in a restaurant, so we ordered for delivery from CPK's web site.  We had always ordered from them through LABite until a bad experience the other day.  Moving forward, we decided to never use that service again. We noticed CPK delivered and charged $10 for a delivery fee, so we decided to go that route.  We ordered/shared the small plate item Crispy Mac N Cheese, Chicken Lettuce Wrap, and the entree Grilled Chicken Chimichurri. NONE of the food was edible! Every single thing was disgusting! We threw everything away after attempting to take a bite of the food.  The Crispy Mac N Cheese was so hard and dry, it was a struggle to cut it. So disgusting. There was no cheese on it.  How damn hard is it to put the fxxxing cheese on the damn mac? Really!  The Chicken Chimichurri entree was in a tiny appetizer type container. I have ordered that entree many times and never once did it come scrunched-up in an appetizer container. It had always come in an entree container; the way it should be. The sauce was half the amount it should have been.  The container it came in was filled only 1/3 of the way. The chicken was also squashed in the container, didn't look right, and the tiny piece we cutt-off to eat was tough and dry.  The lettuce wrap...FORGET IT! By this time, we had enough of this shit and decided to call it quits, toss the inedible food, contact CPK and demand for a refund.  The delivery woman was very nice and professional, but that doesn't cut it.  The food was flat-out disgusting and ended up being a serious waste of our time!  I was so pissed when I called the manager. Keep in mind, it took an hour to have the food delivered 2 blocks away. It was unacceptable for the food to be so horrible.  I could tell the manager was really pissed and wanted me off the phone right way, but I did not give a shit. I was the customer and you screwed me by serving-up this inedible shit. You don't like hearing it from people like me, then do your damn job and do it right! I refuse to settle for less! I simply want what I pay for; nothing more, nothing less!     He supposedly cancelled the credit card transaction; I won't know until the pending activity is cleared. But, that does not justify or make up for the significant loss on my end, created by their negligence.  Steering clear of this place and I strongly advise others to follow...unless you're one of those people who enjoys torture!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine-2?start=100,3.2,2.92,2.92,2.436,3.0320000000000005

PROS: Great patio, good for groups, fantastic service from Melody, cocktails (Bloody Mary & Strawberry Lime Margarita) were enjoyable for a chain restaurant, the Sicilian pizza was tasty CONS:  Blue cheese dressing was warm (I guess they served it in a dish which had just come out of the dishwasher), patio table was very wobbly, Cobb salad arrived missing very key ingredients, namely the avocado! (That's a HUGE error- a Cobb salad sans avocado and blue cheese crumbles is not worth $15 when it is served on iceberg)  Hostesses weren't overly welcoming- but it is Mother's Day and they are busy, so I'm giving them a pass.

1,Rohlin A.,"Mission Viejo, CA",168,802,3662.0,3.0,2015-07-04,"For Father's Day, I decided to a get a huge helping of ""cheese"" at Medieval Times and this past weekend I ended up asking myself ""Dude, Where's my Cheese?"" California Pizza Kitchen (   ) was a place I used to frequent P.Y. (Pre Yelp) and this past weekend the better half and I continued our current P.Y. renaissance. In 1985, two lawyers started California Pizza Kitchen pooling savings accounts and bank loans along with investments from friends to lease a space in Beverly Hills.  PepsiCo purchase 67 percent of the chain (both attorneys received $17.5 million) and immediately started expanding from 26 restaurants in 1992 to 69 restaurants two years later.  In 1997, Pepsi sold its controlling share to Bruckmann, Rosser, Sherrill & Company, who put Fred Hipp in charge of an aggressive expansion campaign, but the attorneys took majority control in 2003 after discovering Hipp had been inflating earning numbers.  Today, CPK is owned by Golden Gate Capital and in 2015 CPK announced a partnership with Make-A-Wish to aid in providing terminally ill children their ""wishes."" The interior remains the same, but a few years ago, this location renovated the patio area in an attempt to keep up with the patios of other restaurants at The Irvine Spectrum.  One thing that has changed was the wait time.  The last time I was here, there would be no way I would get seated right away on a Saturday night, but this evening we were shown a half booth table straight away. There was an almost immediate problem with the place we were seated, for some reason management felt the need to leave the doors to the patio open which was letting out all the cold air and letting in the warm air.  Apparently a number of children were running in between the patio area and the interior of the restaurant. Rohlinism: Much like your dog, if your child can't behave in a restaurant, he / she should be left at home or at the very least be put on a very short leash! After requesting the AC to be turned up, we were informed by the manager the AC was already blasting, but was able to move us to a booth at the back of the restaurant and you literally feel the temperature drop 10 degrees as we walked into this area. The most interesting change I witnessed was the change in complimentary bread from a hard French roll to a fresh sourdough (   ) with olive oil and seasoning.  The new bread is definitely an improvement from the one I remember.  The menu has changed slightly, but my wife's favorite salad (   ) is still available and she substitutes chicken for turkey.  I ordered a twist on their most popular pizza (   ) with a Strawberry Lemonade (   ) to drink. The food came out relatively fast, but sans much in the way of cheese.  Not much I could about the lack of cheese on my pizza, but Laina requested some more cheese for her salad and was given about a cup's worth.  Other than the lack of cheese, there was plenty of fresh veggies, protein and the dressing was really good too.  I think Laina really enjoyed the salad once she had a sufficient amount of cheese. I always had one gripe about pizzas here, not enough toppings.  Even forgetting the lack of gouda on the pizza, the other toppings weren't exactly falling off the pizza.  I do like the BBQ sauce CPK uses and it works well with the red onions and cilantro.  The taste is pretty much exactly the way I remember it ... with the addition of some acidity from the pineapple. The service was friendly and efficient throughout the meal and even the manager came over to make sure everything was ""ok."" I am not sure how CPK is going to fair in the foreseeable future with all the ""three minute"" pizza places popping up offering unlimited toppings for almost half the price.  We will probably return in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine-2?start=40,3.0,2.91,2.91,2.7640000000000002,2.9460000000000006

I suppose we could have told her to time out the courses, but really a good server would have asked when we ordered it. When the server realized she forgot the drinks she ran them over and just said ""sorry"". In my experience it's nicer when the server says sorry and explains what's going on. Just a ""sorry"" is almost useless. Eventually the manager knew something was wrong, but we just saw him leaning on a wall talking to the servers at the computer most of the time. Would've been nice if he noticed those drinks sitting there for 15 minutes.

We had a party of 5.  We were told the wait would be about 45 mins.  At first I thought the long wait was due to it being dinner time and us having a party of 5.  As I looked around the restaurant there were many available tables both inside and outside the entire time we were waiting. They only have 2 small benches in the waiting area so 1 of us had to stand the entire 45 mins of waiting time.  Once our name was called we were seated promptly (The table was not preoccupied by anyone while we were waiting).   The staff was very attentive, our order was accurate and the food all tasted excellent.    If not for the 45 minute wait at the beginning I would most likely be giving this restaurant a 5 star review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine-2?start=80,2.8,2.93,2.93,2.8920000000000003,2.878

I was at the Irvine Spectrum with my two boys and had forgotten my wallet. Only had Apple Pay. Couldn't find a restaurant that accepted Apple Pay, including CPK. My boys and I walked out of the restaurant to continue the search. About 200 feet away from CPK, the general manager, Brett, tracked us down and offered us lunch on him. He went way out of his way to help us out in a time of need. I have had people go out of there way to help me in the past, but never like this. The server, Debbie, totally went out of her way to serve us and take can of the boys.  Of course, I returned and paid for my meal, but they have earned my business forever. This was an experience neither I nor my boys will remember.  And not because I was biased from the experience but the pepperoni pizza and Caesar Salad were exceptional.

After searching the menu for around 15 minutes my friend and I still couldn't decide what to order because nothing really caught our attention. And for a restaurant with ""Pizza"" in its name, their Pizza section on the menu was extremely small and hard to find. My friend and I each ordered pasta, the Shrimp and Zucchini pasta and then the Kung Pao Spaghetti. I paid $3 for chicken on my pasta, and when it was delivered I found only 3 small slices of chicken on my plate. The zucchini pasta was extremely watery and there were miscellaneous pasta noodles throughout both our dishes (rotini, fettuccini). The Kung Pap pasta was better than the zucchini pasta but still WAY overpriced. Overall, not impressed although the service was great.

189,Valerie D.,"San Gabriel, CA",62,103,108.0,4.0,2016-02-16,"I'm so surprised by the three star rating of this CPK!! This location is at such a prime spot with an outdoor mall as well as the movie theater that's across the restaurant, which is perfect for a date! Parking isn't too bad either as there's a few structures as well as lots surrounding the shopping areas.  Anyways, I came here for Valentine's Day and they had a 2 for $32 offer going on. Of course the items came from a pre-determined menu but there was plenty of options and the offer consisted of 1 app, 2 entrees, and a dessert. It's not too shabby for the price you pay, especially on Valentine's and we didn't have to wait long either! My boyfriend and I ordered: - Artichoke dip: This was the perfect amount of cheesy and hearty goodness. There was plenty of chips for the both of us but sadly not the right amount of dip. If I were to go to CPK again, I would def order this. - Sausage pepperoni mushroom pizza: This was pretty standard, not much to rave about. Thin crust and they were very generous with the toppings! - Garlic Alfredo Parmesan with chicken: Such a basic dish and for some reason, my stomach was telling me to get it. However, this dish was such a miss for me. My boyfriend and I both agreed the pasta was undercooked as it was a bit hard and pasta was sticking together. It was a pretty small portion too. - Key lime pie: I was pretty surprised by the first bite because it was the perfect amount of tart and sweet. For those who haven't tried it, it's like a lime cheesecake. Sadly though, the pie became less appetizing the more we ate it. Moving on from the food, our server was Kendall and she was really sweet. She made sure we had bread + olive oil, checked up on us, and even moved tables for us so we'd have more space.

Irvine Spectrum CPK is conveniently located right next to the 24 hour fitness gym I go, on Monday, Tuesday and thursdays. I used to go to woodranch grille a lot after my gym for dinner/drinks, but when they hiked the wine prices just to show our protest, we decided to come to CPK, but that has been one of the wonderful decision we have ever made interms of eating out! the friends I work out with, we usually come here on thursday night around 7:30 or later. We opt to sit the bar, and the bar here is one of the best designed bar, its spread out through the entire restaurant, so you could never complain you couldn't find a seat at the bar. Its still some what manage to make you feel like you are having a private moment, as its arched. I like sitting at the bar looking at all pizzas they make!  Sam is one of the best bar tender ever, and she works here on thursdays and i have seen her on saturday/friday nights too. She is super nice. Makes our time more fun, always takes the time to explain the menu, deals. So prompt with bringing the bread and olive oil(soo good!) out as soon as we sit down!.  I usually opt for the california red wine flight. CPK doesnt sound like a wine destination, and I am pretty sure its not, but if you scan through their menu, you will find their wine list is pretty reasonable for a chain restaurant. During happy Hour ( after 8:30pm)- you can get a flatbread/wine at 10$. super good deal! I dont care for sweet drinks much, but they do have some good sangria(their new raspberry sangria - opt to get that in a bordeux glass, instead of the small flight glass, and the ginger one with basil -is really good!).  I also like their california club pizza(with double chicken. its almost like eating a club sandwich but as pizza. Soo good! I also like their kung pao spaghetti. If i cant convince my bf to take me to pick up stix , this dish is a good alternate to feed to my chinese food cravings! the best part, if you are going to the movies , always get your ticket at CPK. they still sell the movie tickets for 25$ - two tickets, + 10$ concession standard cash card. its such a good deal. remember the movies cost 13$. so you arent paying anything more, but have extra 10$ for diet soda, and a large popcorn. even costco movie tickets are sold at 2 for 19, so this is a really good deal!

We didn't leave the restaurant and we were sitting right in front of the hostess stand the entire time.

We were there around 11am and we were the first customer when they opened.  We started off with the appetizers and salad. Then came our garlic cream pasta. There was one strand of a man's thick black hair - very visible on our plate of pasta (like a garnish!). We called our server and pointed out the HAIR. She apologized and brought the plate back to the kitchen and get us a new one.  Before we received the replacement pasta, she placed the check on our table with all of the charges inc. the pasta's (""for our convenience"" per the server. We did not ask for it yet as we are not even halfway done. Anyway, not a big deal.. so we continued waiting... Then she came back with ""a newly cooked, fresh pasta"" (according to her). So we ate... ate and ate... then my husband saw another strand of hair similar to what we found on the first one. ANOTHER HAIR!!!! I almost threw up. It was disgusting. We called the server again. She took the plate and talked to the manager. She came back with another check just taking off the charge for the pasta and THAT WAS IT! I mean, I would understand on the first event but come on!

We got seated at 6:05 and waitress finally showed up to get our order at 6:40. That's 35 minutes sitting there to just get our order. So, I asked for the manager twice to speak with him but he didn't even bother to come. His name is Ryan Ross the manager at CPK spectrum location. He is very unprofessional in his job and very disappointing that we asked for him TWICE and didn't bother to come over to see what we want. I understand that sometimes you are busy but you can take one second of your busy time when a customer asks for you. As you know, people have a lot of options of dinning nowadays but customer service comes first in this Industry.

Decided to come here because I had a gift card that was long overdue to be used. Decided to dine at the Irvine Spectrum location on a Saturday night before going to see a movie at the Edwards Cinema next door. We arrived around 7pm, there was only a wait of about 10-15mins for two people. We were seated and orders taken promptly, bread and drinks came out quickly.  We ordered 2 pizzas to share, and had plenty of leftovers. California Club Pizza ($15.39): This is an interesting pizza, feels like a salad on top of a pizza crust. I'll admit, it tasted like there was a lot going on in one pizza slice. Stuff kept falling off of the pizza onto my plate with every bite I took. It tasted good... but a bit confusing? Like a pizza having an identity crisis? Probably won't order this one again. Note to self for next time - finish this pizza and don't take home leftovers, it's hard to reheat because of the mixture of hot/cold toppings. BBQ Chicken Pizza ($14.99): This pizza was delicious and everything I expected it to be. It was savory and sweet and had just the right amount of ingredients on it. Chicken wasn't too dry, right amount of BBQ sauce on the pizza. Would order this pizza again. Overall a good meal, minus one star since overall the menu was on the pricier side.
