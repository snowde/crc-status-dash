23,Nate H.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",26,40,5.0,4.0,2012-01-20,"Came here on a slow Monday night with a group of 9. Had pretty decent dinner. I'll start with the positives. Service was speedy and our food for the entire table was up in about 10 minutes. Good thing, cuz we were hungry. The thai spring rolls were very flavorful although some may think the sauces are a little too salty. Spinach and artichoke dip was warm and cheesy. Tortilla and mushroom soup was good too. And if you are in the mood for dessert, order the tiramisu, best one I've had at a restaraunt. It saved this restaraunt from being 3 stars in my book. Negatives: I ordered the gorgonzola and pear pizza with the wheat crust. Bland bland bland. I was craving the gorgonzola, but didn't really taste it anywhere. I surely could taste the roasted hazelnuts though, which didn't really fly with me. At least the crust was a nice texture. Our waitress didn't seem too happy to be there either. Walked around with a stern look glued to her face. Maybe we just caught her on a bad night. Overall none of the food was too stand out excellent for the evening. Also a suggestion for the restaraunt: invest in some heating elements above the food for when it comes out of the oven. If it sits on a cold counter top in an air conditioned building it's going to get real cold real fast before it hits the table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine?start=60,3.44,3.44,3.44,2.8960000000000004,3.4400000000000004
13,Rain F.,"Reno, NV",247,711,906.0,3.0,2012-02-02,"Came here for dinner since we were in the area and I had a giftcard. It was an early and it was a weekday so they weren't too busy. The host was busy with his thick textbook -- reminded me of West's Business Law. So we got seated and asked for drinks.  I was curious with the Italian sodas so I ordered a Peach one. It came with too much ice (refer to pic) and tasted like 7up/Sprite with peach flavoring. We ordered two pizzas, Habanero and thin crust Sicilian. How is it that their thin crust is more expensive than regular crust? When the pizzas arrived, the thin crust appeared to be larger than the regular. Habanero was nothing to rave about until you add the sauce/salsa that comes with it. Oh so spicy and yet just the right kick the pizza needed. The Sicilian wasn't as exciting. Slices of meat thicker than the crust itself seems like an accurate description. I don't think I'd ever be a fan of thin crust. Service was good. Didn't even have to ask for refills as the server just comes with a new glass. Wondered what she would have done if I refused it. $40 for two pizzas and two drinks?  Sorry CPK, I think I'm sticking to my local pizza place. PS.

61,Deborah A.,"Irvine, CA",62,125,373.0,3.0,2012-02-10,"This CPK is pretty hidden, so its probably why there isn't a lot of people out for dinner in the area, but we shall see, since there are new additions around the plaza. My friends came here for our weekly dinner this week. They ended up getting  the Hawaiian BBQ pizza together, while I got the Caesar salad. I didn't try the pizza, but its pretty good, for a split, considering it takes up a extra large plate. One of my friends was near full, but we all had room for the delicious tiramisu. My salad was over dressed with asiago cheese, but since I love it, it didn't really matter to me. The half size was pretty filling too, so if you're craving salad, I suggest going for the full size. The tiramisu was packed with flavor. None of the rum hand espresso missing. It was in your face, good. Just the right filling and flavor, probably makes it in the top of my tiramisu goodness.  Overall, CPK is a nice place for a quiet dinner and food, who's flavor that pops with the unusual combinations as compared to the typical pizza joints.

Great, only problem all my friends ate the whole dinners before my food even came back and we couldn't find anyone to ask about it. Food finally came and manager came to apologize and offered to comp it, or so I thought but when check came taco's were still on check. I had to ask about removing the charge. On top of my food issue, not one of the 5 other guests at our table got a refill on their drinks.

112,Marisela G.,"Valley Center, CA",84,40,2.0,4.0,2012-08-27,"My friend and I had a quick dinner here before I headed back down to San Diego and this location was a little disappointing compared to the ones at home. It might have been because I was exhausted and ready to get home, but who knows? First of all, it took forever to find parking, which I was surprised to see on a late Sunday night. This place is a lot smaller than the ones I've been in but the seating and decor were the same as all of the other ones. We sat outside because the restaurant was too cold for us.  We had the baked mac and cheese craving, hummus & pita bread, tequila lime fetuccini, and full carmelized peach salad. Baked mac and cheese was delicious, it should be a full sized appetizer than just a craving! It comes with 4 pieces which I guess is enough for a ""craving"" but you'll wish you had more. I wasn't too pleased with the hummus but I'm not that big of a fan of it in the first place. The tequila lime fetuccini is what has me coming back to CPK over and over and over again. It. Is. To. Die. For. so good. Carmelized peach salad was good, the full size is entirely too big for just one person. Good idea to split that between two people. We added bacon to it thinking it would complement the sweetness but it kind of overpowered everything else. I know you can never have too much bacon, but for a salad...it might have been excessive. I also had the red sangria which was a little tarty but good.

I'd come here with my friend thinking that I was going to get the garlic chicken pizza, but I couldn't find it on the menu. I asked the waiter when he came around with our waters, and he told us that they were no longer making it. The good thing is that we found out that day that you can add onions and garlic on your pizza for free! So, feeling less devastated, we decided to go meaty and got the Meat Craver's pizza, and added garlic on top. We also got the Tuscan Hummus, which I quite enjoy. The food was yummy and service was prompt. I did think that the crust was a little too thin for my liking, but it was perfectly baked and just the right amount of crispy, so that's a bonus.

My partner's crust was burnt and the waitress was indifferent until it came to tip time. Never coming here again. ALSO:  For those of you who seem curious, the reason why the frozen store version and the restaurant dish taste exactly the same is because THEY'RE THE SAME. Everything at CPK is re-made and shipped to the store to be heated up. If you don't believe me, try and modify something next time you go.

Well as I've said before in my many other California Pizza Kitchen reviews, my daughter loves their Sedona Tortilla Soup and I love their Thai Crunch Salad, so that is what we both ordered.  We shared a little of each other's dishes and we both walked out very satisfied. We dined here yesterday and had very good service.  They were a little busy, so I was happy that we were still able to be seated at a booth.  Our waiter was very friendly and efficient taking our orders for drinks and offering our family their menus.  My daughter always enjoys being able to color her menu.  Not all restaurants consistently offer her something to keep her busy and help pass the time.  Shortly after we received our drinks, he took our orders since we are regulars and didn't need much time to look over their menu.  He offered us bread from the start, which was great since many times in Hawaii I would have to ask for it. Everyone's food arrived pretty quickly and were presented beautifully.  The food was great as always expected.  They can definitely count on us being back the next time we're in the area!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine,3.28,3.28,3.28,3.188,3.2800000000000002

Both pizzas came out warm.. it wasn't hot enough in my point of view.  The barbeque chicken was okay, nothing really special about it even though that is what they are known for.  I usually get the thin crust, so maybe that was the difference in the pizzas.  The new korean barbeque pizza was just not.. good.  It was a plain pizza topped with cole slaw and some ginger/siracha sauce and I would not recommend getting it.  It was not spicy, flavorless and there was barely any barbeque pork on the pizza itself. Service:  The waitress did not ask to refill our waters once and was pretty slow.  The restaurant was rather empty for a Sunday Lunch afternoon, so I honestly expected the customer service to be better.  We only ordered two pizzas, but she didn't even give us any plates for it.  Service was just really slow and the food was mediocre.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine?start=20,3.28,3.4,3.4,2.7920000000000007,3.3520000000000003

Favorite: 1. Lettuce cup with chicken - the crunchiness from one of the veggies inside is a perfect crunch that goes with the rest of the stuffing inside. Got it without the rice noodles b.c. they taste like styrofoam. Ask for extra lettuce cause they never give you enough.  2. Kao Pao Spagetti - sounds weird? that's cause you haven't tried it it. Chicken and peanuts cooked in spicy oil and tossed with spaghetti... perfect for days when you're craving for both Asian & Italian.  3. Wadrof Chicken Salad - the best salad on the menu. Different greens all toss together with chicken, grapes, blue cheese, and walnut~ yummy!  Get the vinaigrette, that's the best dressing they got!

33,Taryn H.,"LADERA RANCH, CA",0,2,,4.0,2013-10-10,"Located across the globe there are about 256 working restaurants filling the hungry stomachs of all ages. California Pizza Kitchen is a casual setting fit for family dinners to a night out on the town. The sit down restaurant has lots of light with large windows and famous pictures of pizza framed and hung around the booths to create conversation with anyone. If your looking for a quick drink and an appetizer there is an option of the bar that sits across from the kitchen so you could smell the mouthwatering food that is placed on a metal shelf waiting to be served. If not there is also a selection of outside seating, booths, or tables to choose from.   The menu consists of multiple pages categorized into pizza, pasta, salad and much more. With all these options it's almost impossible to choose from but there's nothing better than the soft crust of the tostada pizza. Layers of black beans, fresh romaine lettuce, tomatoes and crisp chips all make up this signature dish. It's a hearty mix of salad and pizza warmed to perfection making sure to fulfill your every craving. If all of that isn't enough there is an option of adding slow roasted chicken with a taint layer of sweet barbeque sauce. All of this served cut into 8 slices to share.  To refresh yourself make sure to order the Shirley temple crusted with soft sugar and topped with a cherry or even two if you're lucky. This drink is just the right thing to clean your palate to get ready for dessert. There are about 8 different desserts to choose from including Tiramisu, Butter Cake and sugary Red Velvet Cake but if you ask any server they recommend the Butter Cake and so would I. This dish is something I could eat every day for breakfast lunch and dinner if it wasn't for the massive amount of calories. The calories are well worth it though! The warm cake is moist and spongy baked to perfection and laced with, what other than butter! Served with a scoop of none other than vanilla ice cream that drips down the hot cake and melts in your mouth. This is something you can't pass up!

The other day we asked for regular crust, but they gave us the thin crust instead.. It wasn't that big of a deal because I like thin crust anyway, but wish they could be more careful next time with inputting the orders.   I think CPK is trying out a new thing where they serve fresh bread when you are seated.  I never had that before at other locations and it was my first time here, so maybe it was just this particular location ?  I'm not too sure.  They serve the free bread with some herb-seasoned olive oil.  It was good, but feels like a little carb overload, considering all that dough on the pizzas..

We were quoted $14.03 (inc. tax) for the pizza + the outrageous sum of $10.00 for delivery.  Not having a car, we agreed to the total cost of $24.03.  Delivery was sooner than expected; plates, napkins and plastic silverware were provided as well as 4 pieces of bread and olive oil for dipping. The delivery guy left, but immediately returned to inform us the total was $14.83 and that the amount we gave him was 80 cents short.  I have in front of me the note I wrote when I placed my phone order, their clerk clearly said $14.03 for the pizza + $10.00 for delivery for a grand total of $24.03 and I repeated this back to her.  I have no idea how the delivery guy came up with a shortage of 80 cents, but we paid. We immediately proceeded to serve the pizza and found it to be completely, totally and disgustingly cold.  Not lukewarm, but cold almost like pizza out of a refrigerator.  This hotel room has a small microwave, but we're not fans of microwaved pizza so we ate it cold.  Unfortunately, we paid cash so we had no recourse but to 'eat' the loss. I called and spoke to Lacy who said she was the manager.  I asked if their pizzas are placed inside insulated transport bags like Domino's uses, she said they use those bags but that perhaps our delivery guy took it out of the bag once he arrived at our lot.  It shouldn't take more than 5 minutes to walk from the hotel lobby to our room, so I can't see how a 5 minute walk could cause a hot pizza to suddenly become cold.  I told her they need to review this policy and that the insulated bag should be used up until the moment of delivery.  I also mentioned the 80 cent discrepancy. The pizza was edible and I'd classify it as good but, who enjoys eating cold pizza?  We're very, very disappointed with this expensive experience, it's our first time ordering delivery from this chain.  I don't know if charging the outrageous sum of $10.00 for delivery of a $12.99 pizza is a California thing or if this is a common occurrence with this chain.  I don't plan on ordering takeout from this chain ever again.  By the way, I called Domino's after-the-fact to ask about the cost of its delivery, it's $2.50.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine,3.24,3.37,3.37,,3.318

First of all when we came in around 3, it was pretty SLOW, there were not that many customers so we thought we would be done eating within an hour. However when we finished our chips, our server at no point came up to us and updated us on how long the pizza was going to take, we were literally sitting there for about 20 minutes waiting. When she finally brought the pizza out to us, she had forgotten to mention that a gluten free pizza takes a little bit longer than usual. She should have told us that when we first ordered considering that we might have somewhere to go afterwards which we did. She didn't even bring us plates, we had to ask her when she came back with the cheese and pepper shakers.  When we were done with the pizza, our server was no where to be found! We asked another guy to bring us the bill and he said he would go look for her. He obviously didn't find her because we were sitting there for another 10-15 minutes just waiting on our bill. What he could've done was just bring us the bill when we asked for it because that's all we wanted. Then we just decided to just go to the front desk and pay. Another guy was ringing us out and was apologizing for what was going on. It was pretty ridiculous how no one offered to check up on us while we were just sitting waiting patiently for our bill which never came.  This is seriously the SLOWEST customer service we have ever came across. We were there for about 2 hours and we didn't even order that big of a meal.  What was even more rude and disrespectful was when we were walking towards our car in the parking lot, we saw our server and the guy who was looking for her outside in the parking lot having a conversation. The first thing the guy asks us was did we pay? ARE YOU SERIOUS OF COURSE WE PAID, WHAT DO WE LOOK LIKE TO YOU NOT PAYING?! YEAH YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKED, WE SHOULDN'T EVEN HAVE PAID TO BE HONEST. That was the first thing he asked us when he saw us, he should have apologized for keeping us waiting when we just simply asked for the bill.

What I also thought was smart, was instead of having one bill for all of us or breaking it into the 2 separate bills for the two tables, the waitress compartmentalized the entire bill to only 8 people's orders per bill and by doing so, it was less hectic at the end of the evening.  Also, once the sun went down and the evening became cooler, the heat lamps were turned on. I don't doubt many of us appreciated it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine,3.24,3.35,3.35,,3.306
0,Jeff L.,"Newport Beach, CA",22,271,2061.0,4.0,2014-04-26,"Caesar Salad had no dressing on it. Ok, it's better than too much but seriously, it was bone dry. Had the Spicy Chicken Tinga Quesadilla from the small plate menu and the toppings were a little sparce but for that price point I couldn't expect too much. The Ranchito sauce was awesome though and after I ran out of the caesear dressing that they brought extra for my salad, I polished off the salad with that.  Staff is fast and very attentive with food and drink requests.  Was dead at 11:25, then about half the place filled out by 11:35.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine,3.28,3.36,3.36,,3.3280000000000003
77,Joe P.,"Irvine, CA",477,28,82.0,1.0,2014-05-02,"No greeting. no service. No compassion. We left... Family of six. I don't recommend this place. The wait-persons do not prioritize the right way. Three parties who were seated after us got their orders in, way before we even were offered beverages. Don't go to this location... Make the drive to the Irvine Spectrum.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine?start=20,3.24,3.33,3.33,,3.294
51,John C.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,10,,2.0,2014-06-12,"First time here and I have to say it was pretty mediocre. The pizza was very greasy and honestly tasted a little ""sloppy"" if you will. I prefer the taste of Dominos personally.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine?start=40,3.2,3.31,3.31,,3.266
7,Milly R.,"Huntington Beach, CA",64,40,7.0,1.0,2014-07-14,"Worst service ever. I have been treated better at a McDonalds in Anaheim.  My server acted like my brothers and friends weren't good enough to be served. Her name is Kristen and she was so condescending and was not friendly at all. It's as if she couldn't give good service to Asians. She was only friendly and smiled at other tables filled with Caucasians.  She also ignored us whenever we'd make eye contact and raise our hands for more water or for more help.  To make it worse, she charged me extra for a free appetizer when she clearly stated she would do it. After, the manager who helped with my refund was patronizing and treated me like a 5 year old.

49,Ev R.,"Gardena, CA",0,1,,5.0,2014-07-16,"The atmosphere is very open and casual. They have a gluten-free menu for those who are gluten sensitive, like me. The gluten-free pizzas are delicious, and I recommend the mango iced tea. The chile relleno is also a delicious choice. At the end, they do you the favor of packaging your leftover food for you, rather than just giving you the boxes for you to fill it yourself, like some restaurants. The prices are excellent and affordable. One dollar sign, as advertised.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-irvine?start=40,3.16,3.29,3.29,,3.238
