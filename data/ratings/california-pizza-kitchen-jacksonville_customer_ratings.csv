I am open to trying it again, as I realize there is at least one crap server at every restaurant...my server was exceptionally incompetent at CPK. I tend to surround myself with a pretty attractive group of ladies. Never did I imagine that this would be to my detriment. On this visit, there were 4 of us dining. I'm going to go out on a limb and say this was our server's first serving job, and he must have been new. If you don't know how to manage a lunch rush, the least you can do is acknowledge your inability to do your job. That way, at least your table knows you know the exist. Apparently this guy had a soft spot in his heart for Italians (much to my dismay, as one of the women dining with us was full-blooded Sicilian). Once he finally showed up to the table, he went out of his way to accommodate ONE person at the table...the saucy Italian. Great. All I wanted was a water. Just a water. Is it too much to ask to refill my water, along with the Italian's, when they're both empty? We're in FLORIDA in the middle of SUMMER. This is not a tall request.  We sat for an excessively long time after being greeted, so when he was walking by, I politely asked if we could place our order and he scoffed and explained to me that he had several tables and he was working as fast as he could. Sorry bro, doesn't work for me. I've been in your shoes an I know how this is supposed to go. Considering he'd visited all his other tables around us TWICE already, I wasn't sympathetic, and decided it was our turn.  Bad move. He literally ignored my drink for the entire meal. The Italian (and no one else) was accommodated prior to her even requesting things. The best part was, after chewing on ice to make the point that I was clearly being neglected, he turned to the saucy Italian and asked her if she'd like a water to go.  I honestly couldn't tell you what I ordered, how it tasted, what the restaurant even looked like. All I saw was red.

Lights were dimmed, staff was polite and welcoming, swanky ultra modern decor that was easy on the eyes...all made for a very delightful visit.

The bread had cheese and herbs baked in, and was very delish when dipped in the olive oil and parmesan. Soon after, my all-time fave, the White Pizza (mozzarrela, ricotta, parmesan, pecorino romano,sauteed spinach, and roasted garlic) was set before me. I love, love, LOVE this pizza. Cheesy crusty goodness, and the touch of garlic fuses everything together. Never a disappointment.  Mom went with the California Veggie Pizza (baby broccoli, eggplant, corn, red onions, mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, mozzarella, and tomato sauce), and requested a whole wheat crust. She said it was very flavorful, but she had hoped that there would be more of an abundance of veggies on her pizza, that they were pretty scattered. Family friend...based on a recommendation from our server...had the mac n cheese. I had a couple bites and thought it was very good and not artificial-tasting. She liked it as well, but wanted a deeper and more prominent cheese flavor.  Service: Spot on from the get-go, thank you, Jordan.

148,Valerian L.,"Jacksonville, United States",3,18,15.0,4.0,2014-05-12,"The last time I went to CPK, I had a less-than-satisfactory experience. The food was either salty or just didn't taste like it was described as. This time, however I had an experience that signified a significant improvement at this location. Don't get me wrong, I actually loved CPK. There was this brilliant location about 15 minutes from my old home in Southern California, where you had a view that would rival those experienced by Marco Polo in Asia. The food there was certainly on par for the price bracket and it's a shame that I haven't been there in seven years. I visited CPK's Jacksonville location about four times since its opening and found it underwhelming. Obviously, since it was CALIFORNIA Pizza Kitchen, and not FLORIDA Pizza Kitchen, you would expect the highest quality establishments to be concentrated around the chain's area of origin. (This is something that most chain businesses should avoid doing yet it seems to be a recurring pattern with some.) Tonight I went to California Pizza Kitchen again, having received a call from my father who invited me to join him and my mother. He just got 100 dollars worth of gift cards for CPK and I thought that my brother, sister and I could join them.        The location itself was chosen when the Saint John's Town Centre was in no shortage of open real estate in prime locations. (CPK is located near the ever-so-popular Turtle Pond, sharing a circle with Starbucks, Teavana and Maggiano's Little Italy. It's hard to get such openings in the main area of the TC unless you're a multi-billion dollar company that can commission an entire new complex for you're store. I'm looking at you,Nordstrom.) As a result of this, CPK usually gets plenty of customers. (At least more than its neighbour: ""The Art of Shaving"" would ever get.) On an occasion, CPK can have 90+ minute waiting lists. We caught the place on a nice, quiet, meaningless Friday, which allowed us to enjoy our meal in the quiet, serene setting. We had Avacado Chicken Rolls as an appetiser. The crunchy wonton-like shell blended with the warm, flavourful filling. Which contained tomatoes, bacon and chicken. It was served with a spicy, creamy sauce and a non-spicy sauce of the same texture. For our entrée, we had three varieties of pizza: Habanero Carnitas, a soft- crusted pizza with a ""habanero element"" that wasn't actually as spicy as a real habanero pepper, but still enjoyable due to its well seasoned pork. Chipotle Chicken, a pizza with a semi-thick crust, which like the Habanero Carnitas, shares Mexican influence. The Chipotle Chicken featured tender grilled chicken, a seasoning that actually made it spicier than the Habanero Carnitas, and a Pico de Gallo topping. The pizza is served with a spicy chipotle sauce on the side that is sure to add a nice kick. Lastly we had the ""Pear+Gorgonzola"" a thin-crusted, crunchy masterpiece. The Pear+Gorgonzola, (which I will call the PG) was not only delicious due to the overall execution of the recipe, but the idea itself. CPK dared to experiment with unlikely ideas, and created one of the best slices of Pizza I have eaten. (It sits right up there some of the stuff that comes out of Libretto's, my all-time-favourite pizzeria.)    The PG is a sweet, yet slightly sour pizza, which is served as a regular pizza with Gorgonzola Cheese, which gives it the strong, Blue Cheese type flavour. The PG also includes some sliced pears, which taste like very delicious pears, and add to the sweetness of the pizza. There are some herbs and stuff, and the whole thing's served below a bed of salad with more Gorgonzola. I suppose what made the PG so spectacular is the flavour contrast, which was a risky move for CPK, yet one most rewarding. The meal overall was the highlight of my day. I think it is safe to say that California Pizza Kitchen, to me has redeemed itself. 4.8/5 stars.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-jacksonville?start=40,3.64,3.64,3.64,2.6719999999999997,3.6400000000000006

This is because of all the chain restaurants around town, I can get in and get out fairly quickly by choosing to sit at the bar rather than a table. Given that our CPK is located in the St. John's Town Center, this is quite the miracle.   Although, I haven't come to CPK and actually sat down on at a table, I know my opinion is fairly limited. It is, however, disappointment-free. I'm very happy that CPK has the option of sitting at the bar. If they didn't, they would probably turn away a ton of customers. The folks, like myself, who want to get in for a quick bite are just as important as the family of five. The other great part about the bar is being able to watch the employees construct meals and to see that huge brick oven.  I had a slight annoyance during my last visit to CPK, but it was nothing to do with the employees. I had to work on Veteran's Day and went to CPK for my lunch. The bar had a few empty seats, but not enough for this party of five (a mother and four teenage girls) that walked straight to the back.

Finally, the waitress in charge of the bar area asked them to leave and profusely apologized to all of us that were sitting. She told us to take our time and eat and not let ourselves be rushed.

8,Valerian L.,"Jacksonville, FL",3,18,15.0,4.0,2014-12-05,"The last time I went to CPK, I had a less-than-satisfactory experience. The food was either salty or just didn't taste like it was described as. This time, however I had an experience that signified a significant improvement at this location. Don't get me wrong, I actually loved CPK. There was this brilliant location about 15 minutes from my old home in Southern California, where you had a view that would rival those experienced by Marco Polo in Asia. The food there was certainly on par for the price bracket and it's a shame that I haven't been there in seven years. I visited CPK's Jacksonville location about four times since its opening and found it underwhelming. Obviously, since it was CALIFORNIA Pizza Kitchen, and not FLORIDA Pizza Kitchen, you would expect the highest quality establishments to be concentrated around the chain's area of origin. (This is something that most chain businesses should avoid doing yet it seems to be a recurring pattern with some.) Tonight I went to California Pizza Kitchen again, having received a call from my father who invited me to join him and my mother. He just got 100 dollars worth of gift cards for CPK and I thought that my brother, sister and I could join them.        The location itself was chosen when the Saint John's Town Centre was in no shortage of open real estate in prime locations. (CPK is located near the ever-so-popular Turtle Pond, sharing a circle with Starbucks, Teavana and Maggiano's Little Italy. It's hard to get such openings in the main area of the TC unless you're a multi-billion dollar company that can commission an entire new complex for you're store. I'm looking at you,Nordstrom.) As a result of this, CPK usually gets plenty of customers. (At least more than its neighbour: ""The Art of Shaving"" would ever get.) On an occasion, CPK can have 90+ minute waiting lists. We caught the place on a nice, quiet, meaningless Friday, which allowed us to enjoy our meal in the quiet, serene setting. We had Avacado Chicken Rolls as an appetiser. The crunchy wonton-like shell blended with the warm, flavourful filling. Which contained tomatoes, bacon and chicken. It was served with a spicy, creamy sauce and a non-spicy sauce of the same texture. For our entrée, we had three varieties of pizza: Habanero Carnitas, a soft- crusted pizza with a ""habanero element"" that wasn't actually as spicy as a real habanero pepper, but still enjoyable due to its well seasoned pork. Chipotle Chicken, a pizza with a semi-thick crust, which like the Habanero Carnitas, shares Mexican influence. The Chipotle Chicken featured tender grilled chicken, a seasoning that actually made it spicier than the Habanero Carnitas, and a Pico de Gallo topping. The pizza is served with a spicy chipotle sauce on the side that is sure to add a nice kick. Lastly we had the ""Pear+Gorgonzola"" a thin-crusted, crunchy masterpiece. The Pear+Gorgonzola, (which I will call the PG) was not only delicious due to the overall execution of the recipe, but the idea itself. CPK dared to experiment with unlikely ideas, and created one of the best slices of Pizza I have eaten. (It sits right up there some of the stuff that comes out of Libretto's, my all-time-favourite pizzeria.)    The PG is a sweet, yet slightly sour pizza, which is served as a regular pizza with Gorgonzola Cheese, which gives it the strong, Blue Cheese type flavour. The PG also includes some sliced pears, which taste like very delicious pears, and add to the sweetness of the pizza. There are some herbs and stuff, and the whole thing's served below a bed of salad with more Gorgonzola. I suppose what made the PG so spectacular is the flavour contrast, which was a risky move for CPK, yet one most rewarding. The meal overall was the highlight of my day. I think it is safe to say that California Pizza Kitchen, to me has redeemed itself. 4.8/5 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-jacksonville?start=40,3.6,3.6,3.6,2.8320000000000003,3.6000000000000005

135,Michael A.,"Jacksonville, United States",143,20,37.0,4.0,2016-02-02,"New year, new you??!!!  I enjoy this place for the two following reasons: 1) The pizza's calories are readily found on all major calorie trackers apps such as My Fitness Pal. This allows me to correctly track my macros each day.  Most pizza places do not have this options and tracking other pizza brands for calories isn't as accurate.   2) The pizza comes in a delicious single serving size. The OG Hawaiian Pizza is only a 1,200 calories compared to Little Caesars 2,500 calories for one pizza of similar size. With pizza that has this much flavor in a restaurant setting, it should be illegal!  I would recommend this place for people who are around the town center and do not want to over do it on the Carbs at ""that Italian restaurant"" there.  They have a wide arrange of food there that are not pizza as well. And, they have low/zero calorie drink options there as well.  While they are amazing, the avocado egg rolls will destroy your diet and weight loss. Avoid at all cost. Still with a single pizza as your cheat meal; you must avoid most of the appetizers at all cost!!!  The service is usually good there. The last time that I went there, I had a waitress named Michie. She was very polite and quick to help us with the menu. Overall, service there is great. It is only a few time in between shifts that things seem to not function as well. The older lady at the door who sits guest down somehow is always in the bathroom when people come in. IDK if she has a medical condition or what... but both times that I have seen her there... the same issues with customers walking in and no one being at the door was present.

I ordered my pizza thin crust and there was an extra charge for that, which I found to be just weird. Not to mention the crust was sooooooo hard that I thought I was going to crack a tooth.  This also was my first experience finding fried Mac & Cheese in Jacksonville. So, I was excited only to be let down by the bland, clumpy cheese balls and odd colored sauce.  I regret not visiting the new trendy [PIEOLOGY] pizza spot which is just steps away @ ST. JOHN'S towncenter.  I'm truly surprised California Pizza Kitchen continues surviving at towncenter.

Name was never called after 30 min so I asked the manager with the attitude where I was on the list. She told me they already called my name 15 minutes ago. And if they actually had they only said it once because every other persons name they yelled multiple times. So when I told the manager that I still wanted to eat. Instead of finding the next seat for us she put me at the end of her now 2 hour long list. I have never in all my years of working in food seen such absurdity. A man in a wheelchair got pushed out of the lobby because it was too busy and he took up too much room. This place and It's manager is horrendous and I hope no veteran ever goes to this place. Thy have no respect for their customers or their military. Most military members have hearing issues and to not try and accommodate them speaks volumes on the level of courtesy and respect they have.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-jacksonville?start=20,3.64,3.15,3.15,,3.346

51,Megan C.,"Ponte Vedra Beach, FL",0,5,12.0,4.0,2017-12-20,"CPK is a great option for grabbing lunch at the St. John's Town Center. Service is not super fast, but not too slow either. If the weather's nice, it's nice to sit outside on their patio and watch the crowds. I like their hand-tossed cheese pizzas, adding ham - you can also get the pizzas on thin crust.

The food taste is still eh, but this time leaving me with acid reflux and many trips to the restroom. In addition, the food would have to taste amazingly good to spend the amount of money they charge for such small portions.
