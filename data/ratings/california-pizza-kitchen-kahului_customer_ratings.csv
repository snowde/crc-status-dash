8,John R.,"Warren, NJ",152,1133,296.0,3.0,2012-09-10,Great for a bite to eat before boarding. The pizza does run through an oven on a belt so if you are looking for a brick oven experience do that before your trip off the island. There are a lot of seats to sit down which is wonderful -- if the only thing to compare it  to was Terminal 6 or 7 at LAX this place would get 9 stars. On the down side service is a bit slow so unless you have time to kill do not try to grab something and run to your plane.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kahului?start=20,2.38,2.38,2.38,2.38,2.38

It's located in a little food court within the airport. Also located here was Burger King, Pinkberry and a bar (name escapes my mind). Initially, I was drawn to Burger King but after seeing the price of a Whopper meal was comparable to a pizza, I decided to go with a semi-healthier option of CPK. Overall, the service was okay and so was my pizza. Nothing to really write about. It's not as good as the restaurant but it is from a fast food setting. The size of the pizza was decent and since we ordered 2 pizzas (one per person) it was more than enough for me. My only gripe was how does a margherita pizza cost more than their other pizzas? I found that strange considering it's the simplest pizza to make. Eh moving on. :)  They also sell pre-made salads and sandwiches but I can't speak for those.  Would I eat here again?

I recently visited Maui and my wife and I went to CPK based on positive previous expriences and I wanted to enjoy a quick decent meal before my flight back to the states.  It was a big, big mistake. I waited in line and I went to place my order as I contacted a young woman behind the counter.  She seemed annoyed and did not even make eye contact with me, let alone say ""hi.""  I ordered two pizzas and two beers.  One beer for me and one for my wife, who was sitting down and looking after our luggage.  The cashier looked at me and said in a robotic/perturbed way, ""You can only order one beer at a time.""  I tried to explain to her that I was ordering food for my wife and I and one of the beers was for her.  I tried to explain to her that my wife was watching our bags, when she interrupted me in mid-sentence.  ""You can only order one beer at a time"", as she explained it to me again like I was a child asking for an extra treat.  I noticed that there were about 8 people behind me and I did not want my wife to wait in line for only one beer, so I offer what I thought was a reasonable solution.  I pointed to my wife, who was sitting down about 10 feet away and I asked if it was ok for her to come up to the counter, show her ID, so she could buy a beer and avoid waiting in line. This simple request was met with a reaction as if I asked her to explain Einstein's Theory of Relativity.  She rolled her eyes and said she would need to ask her ""manager"" for permission.  She yelled over to the area of the adjacent Burger King and asked some man if I could buy two beers. Needless to say, he said no.  This scene was similar to the Meet the Parents movie scene with the female flight attendant at the end of the movie.  ""Step aside sir"", when there was no one there, was replaced with, ""You can only buy one beer at a time.""     My wife and I sipped on the one beer we were given permission to buy and when my food came up, I walked to the counter.  The worker placed the food on the counter and quickly walked away.  No, ""thank you"" or, maybe asking if I wanted a napkin.     The pizzas were bad.  Too much sauce and not enough cheese.  The crust tasted like it had been frozen and it was not fresh.  If someone would have served this to me and told me it was from CPK, I would not have believed them.  It really was that bad. This place is giving CPK a bad name and someone from corporate needs to pay a little unannounced visit as a customer.  At this location, CPK appeared to be merged with a Burger King here and I hope that this not a continuing trend.  CPK needs to do a little research and look up the Green Burrito/Carl's Jr. merger that happened years back.   A really bad experience on all levels.  Wake up CPK!!!  You are better than this worthless abomination.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kahului,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4

The food was poorly made and only vaguely resembled the food I have had at other California Pizza Kitchen locations. We ordered the Hawaiian Pizza, Tortilla Soup, and the Chinese Chicken Salad. The soup was the only item that tasted good. The pizza was under-cooked and the salad was premade. I wish I told the cashier to cancel the salad from our order when she told me to grab a salad from the refrigerated shelf, but she had already rang up my husband's credit card so I selected my salad and hoped for the best.

27,Jenny F.,"Mountain View, CA",367,69,178.0,3.0,2017-08-06,"Had a layover at OGG for forty minutes around 1pm and wanted to grab a quick bite before boarding onto our next flight. The lines were extremely long, there were only three people staying the whole place: one at the register, one adding toppings too pizzas, and another loading them into the oven and boxing them once done. The staff were taking their time walking from one station to another, a little more leisurely than a frazzled traveler would like anyway. We were told that there was a twenty minute wait for pizzas. When our number was called, we had to inhale our meal before dashing to our gate, which at this point had already started boarding our number. Good was great though, but awfully overpriced ($13) for a small personal pizza though. Airport prices I suppose.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kahului,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28
38,Nikki P.,"Las Vegas, NV",47,5,,1.0,2017-08-18,If I could put no star I would!   Love the food (been to many of these) but the employees are not friendly at all. And when coming up to cashier not even greeted.  You have to say....  can I order here?  Bad business but I guess they don't care as we (the travelers) have to eat. I saw the employees he rude to an older gentlemen. And all he wanted to know was how long before his pizza is ready.  Food good. Employees rude and not friendly,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kahului,2.2,2.2,2.2,,2.2
34,WHIT D.,"San Jose, CA",0,13,5.0,1.0,2017-10-03,"Don't even bother if to ask about vegan options or if you have a dairy allergy...simply just asked the guy at the counter if there was any option without cheese or meat and he looked at me like I was an idiot and just said ""no"" and walked away. No explanation, no kind ""I'm sorry but we don't"" ...just plain ""no."" It's very apparent that he hates his job and should probably get a new one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kahului,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08
26,Fran C.,"Honolulu, HI",460,954,11214.0,3.0,2017-10-04,"Are you sure this is a CPK? Okay, okay...........I get it.  All of these restaurants in the Kahului Airport is run by HMS Host, so even though you see the eateries in the airport like - California Pizza Kitchen or Burger King, you may not be actually eating the food with the same standard as you would get, if you had gone to their regular restaurant in a mall.  Does that make sense? I was flying home from Maui when I realized I needed to stop & get something to eat for lunch. A 5:00 pm lunch is pretty late, but better late, then never? No? While hangin' at the airport, I noticed a CPK, so I decided to check out the newly revamped food court in the Kahului airport.  Upon walking into the little food court, it was totally empty..........but that's okay with me, because that means no waiting for me! Upon walking up to the ordering counter, I was greeted right away, and upon looking over the menu I decided to get a Magherita Pizza which consisted of Italian tomatoes with fresh mozzarella, fresh basil, & parmesan. And to wash all of this down, I got an ice tea ($2.99). What can I say about the grub? Basically when you've been up since 5 am, and are eating lunch at 5 pm, anything you eat at this time probably taste pretty good by now! Lol! But in all honesty............I really thought I was eating some kinda Tombstone frozen cheese pizza! Buwahahahahaha! Take a look at the pic I took of my Magherita pizza! Where was the tomatoes, & basil??? Small kine M.I. A. if you can see the pic I took of my pizza!!!  Well, maybe my expectations were kinda high, but this pizza definitely wasn't worth the $13.69 I shelled out for a small personal sized pizza, nor was the $2.99 I paid for the ice tea, but I guess I was paying for the ""convenience"" factor at the airport. There are not too many food options at the Kahului Airport, so if you're hungry...........may I suggest you buy & eat something before you head to the airport, otherwise you maybe stuck with bad, & expensive food!
