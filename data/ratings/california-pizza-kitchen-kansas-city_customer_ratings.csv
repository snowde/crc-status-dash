23,Maria P.,"Kansas City, MO",7,66,,5.0,2012-04-07,"I've been here so many times and I have never had a bad experience. I love it. The pizza is amazing. And you can't just order pepperoni or something so generic. You have to get the Thai Chicken Pizza or something unique, because they are to die for. The service every time has been just as incredible. They reccommend the best things and they are so nice and friendly!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city,,,,,
13,Bloss C.,"Jersey City, NJ",731,1014,2378.0,3.0,2012-05-30,"You been to one CPK, you've been to them all, right?  Well, almost.  This CPK has very good service, friendly waitstaff, and are very accommodating of special dietary request.  Also has affordable wine options.  Dining at the plaza usually involves a rather serious line, so it's nice to finally be seated and have nice waiters.  Food is good in a heavy calorie inducing coma kind of way.  I recommend the Field Greens salad (pears and candied walnuts tossed in homemade Dijon balsamic vinaigrette) with Gorgonzola added.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city,,,,,
20,witty b.,"Mission, KS",0,34,1.0,5.0,2013-01-12,"My new favorite pizza joint.  Only eaten there once but it is the best pizza I've had since I was a kid.  It is gets expensive if you order soft drinks and dessert.  The pizza is about the size of a Tony's frozen pizza so only 6 slices.  It looks like they use a brick oven to cook it in which makes the perfect crust.  We went NewYrs Eve early in the evening and the weather wasn't very good so there wasn't a line.  The service was good.   Three pizzas, 5 soft drinks, 4 desserts came to $80. I will definitely eat their pizza again, but  I will probably do carry out next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city,,,,,
7,Carly N.,"Oklahoma City, OK",228,613,3460.0,5.0,2013-02-18,"I love this plaza CPK location! I've been here many times over the years and have never been disappointed! The restaurant is always clean and classy, the food arrives in a timely manner, and service is splendid.  The California Club is my all time favorite pizza. It contains smoked bacon, mozzarella, chicken, topped with fresh lettuce and avocado on top. It's a healthier meal option and doesn't leave me feeling bloated like pizzas from other chain restaurants. It doesn't matter which pizza you get, they never come out covered in grease. The only dessert I've tried is the tiramisu and I don't like it. It has a bitter taste and just doesn't hit the spot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city,,,,,
11,Paul M.,"Overland Park, KS",262,195,35.0,4.0,2013-06-09,Sure it's a chain.   But it's a good chain.  And they keep it clean.  that counts for a lot. A great deal for the money and always a special treat.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city,,,,,
22,B And B Sho W.,"Independence, MO",0,4,,3.0,2013-09-05,"Went and visited for lunch. Hostess was quick to greet, led us to a clean booth for two.  Ordered the pizza pie,  after the short arrival, the very first slice to pick from, I noticed a piece of plastic attached to the food.  I informed the waitress, mgr came to visit as well. I told them both it wasnt a big deal, and sure that the rest of the pie was edible.  Service overall was suburb and the way the situation was handle was overly professional.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city,,,,,
21,Sharlene T.,"Kansas City, MO",3,9,7.0,1.0,2013-10-05,"Didn't have a good experience here. The only thing good was the crust. Everything else was tasteless; food that tastes like it came out of a machine. Didn't even enjoy the guacamole with chips, something you can't go wrong with. Chips tasted like those you buy in the grocery store, while the guac tasted like just mashed avocado with diced potato and defrosted corn.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city,,,,,
10,Carrie C.,"Kansas City, MO",104,148,52.0,4.0,2013-11-21,"I really like the location of California Pizza Kitchen. I only wish that the Plaza had easier parking along Ward Parkway. Such a pain. But I digress. I came here a couple weeks ago with a friend from work for lunch and ordered the turkey club on focaccia and an order of fried macaroni as a starter. While my company was on the strange side (he's an interesting young man, to say the least), I enjoyed my visit. Our food came out pretty quickly, and our waitress kept our glasses full while we waited. The macaroni bites came out first and were so so good. They were piping hot with a crispy bread crumb crust and drizzled with a little bit of extra cheese - I'll definitely be ordering these again! My sandwich came out soon after we finished the macaroni bites and I dove in. The thing was bigger than I expected, so I only ate half, but the bread was incredible. I absolutely loved the seasoning and texture, which was soft yet slightly crispy on the outside. The dressing that came on it had great flavor and the turkey was well seasoned and wasn't dry, which I'm always afraid of when ordering turkey breast (definitely a dark meat fan, here).  Overall, my experience here was good. For being my first visit to chain like this, I'd definitely be okay with coming back soon, especially to try some of the pizza they're named for and FOR SURE to order some more of those macaroni bites.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city,,,,,
16,Fabiana Z.,"Olathe, KS",35,52,22.0,4.0,2013-12-27,"Consistently tasty fresh pizza. Service is usually pretty good as well. The best thing is that the kiddos love it and always enjoy it! Ordered the BLT and the original chicken barbecue pizza. Bacon was crisp, avocados were fresh and crust was delicious. Miller light was served in an ice cold glass. Dessert was a bit on the pre-produced side but again, the kiddos liked it. Happy kids, Happy mom.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city,,,,,
9,Jennifer S.,"Kansas City, MO",79,104,21.0,2.0,2014-01-03,"Well, the niece said it was the best pizza she had ever had!   I on the other hand was satisfied enough to get full with my cardboard and peppers.  For a chain it's ok.  With the menu over priced and the servers lacking any experience at all... I would rather stay home with the frozen pizza in the oven.  No offense to anyone who enjoys it - but I am a pizza stickler for all things dough and it would have been better to spend the money at a local joint like D'Bronx or Record Bar's Pizza.  Ps- Niece also said the Sprite was the best she ever had too......",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city,,,,,
19,Ronisha M.,"Los Angeles, CA",272,26,24.0,5.0,2014-01-11,"I Love the Pasta and the BBQ Chicken Pizza! I Jus love to Eat and this restaurant definitely made my tastebuds Jump. Its clean and the service is nice. The Food came out right away, and the View of the downtown shopping area made it seem chic. Will be coming back for more pasta",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city,,,,,
6,Cindy R.,"Kansas City, MO",116,361,353.0,3.0,2014-01-24,"Brought my ""Little"" here last week for a little dinner and I was surprised that it was absolutely dead... Actually, it's Restaurant Week in KC and they don't have any specials so it's not THAT surprising. The service was great... the food was just ""sub par"" in my opinion. I ordered off the small plates menu since it was still Happy Hour and ended up with a wedge salad and a flatbread pizza.  I think the pizza was lacking something but I can't think of it at this moment and the salad was kinda blah.  Everything was fresh though. My ""Little"" ordered off the kids menu, pasta with tomato sauce, and seemed to really enjoy it.  I don't know many 12 year old kids who don't like pasta with tomato sauce though.    CPK is good but if I'm going for a more ""adult"" pizza, I'd pick some place else.  Kids love it though! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city,,,,,
5,Alyssa R.,"Kansas City, MO",91,81,97.0,4.0,2014-01-27,This pizza is really good. It's more upscale so you see people dressed nicer than eating at a regular pizza place but I like it.  I've gotten the BBQ Chicken pizza and it is amazing! It was fresh and the crust was perfect. The toppings were good I would just recommend asking for more cheese! The service was good however you are paying more for quality than an actual pizza size. Tastes good but can probably still survive for dessert afterwards.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city,,,,,
14,Wayne F.,"Kansas City, MO",12,8,,4.0,2014-08-16,"Had a hand tossed pepperoni pizza, just a bit greasy, but great tasting. My gf had a spinach and quinoa salad with dried tomatoes and onion. She really liked it. Service was pretty fast and very nice. We'll definitely come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city,,,,,

8,Mark G.,"Roanoke, TX",35,456,2.0,3.0,2014-09-18,Haven't eaten at CPK since I lived in CA.  I've had their frozen pizzas after moving away from CA and enjoyed them for what they were so I figured I'd give the restaurant another try after all these years.  I had the Sicilian pizza.  It was good.  Definitely better than frozen but nothing special really.  Like another reviewer said here it seemed to be lacking something...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kansas-city,3.64,3.64,3.64,,3.6400000000000006
