123,Cat M.,"Waipahu, HI",19,49,4.0,5.0,2016-09-30,"Here we are on the first day that CPK opened in Kapolei. The wait was reasonable - 40 minutes at 5pm.  Once inside we were greeted by everyone that walked by. Nearly all the servers, trainers and managers stopped by our table to see how we were doing.  No sooner had we finished eating than they were there taking our plates, bringing more bread or filling our drinks. The wait staff has been well trained and the food was top notch! I hope that they continue the excellent service.  We did notice that many tables were empty although many people were waiting outside, perhaps the kitchen couldn't handle a full service. With time I'm sure they will run at full capacity.  It's nice to have more and more options for dining here on the Westside. We have waited a long time for this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kapolei?start=200,3.732,3.732,3.732,3.732,3.732

We enjoyed the flight of sangria, the new fried cauliflower with Siracha Buffalo sauce - so hot and good with the blue cheese dressing and celery salad. The halibut was amazing... Even more was the squash beneath the halibut. I'd order a dish of that and eat it alone. The rib eye was topped with blue cheese butter and gave it a creamy rich taste. The lemon juice salad was nice. To finish - the infamous pumpkin cheesecake. Love the new decor. Lots of refurbished pallets and up cycled materials.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kapolei?start=220,3.636,3.636,3.636,3.636,3.636
62,Joanne M.,"Ewa Beach, HI",3,45,291.0,4.0,2016-09-30,How exciting to have CPK in Kapolei! We had to try it out on the first day. The restaurant itself is beautiful! A modern/contemporary ambiance. Still very noise though. The black & white pics of old Hawai'i are perfect. The bar is a separate area with seating all around. We sat right next to the pizza oven area. It was very entertaining watching them work. We will be visiting the CPK a lot since it's close to home. Congratulations Alfred & staff!

38,Jan K.,"Waianae, HI",105,351,2586.0,3.0,2016-10-02,"CPK (Kapolei - Ka Makana Ali'i). (2.67 stars). Let me start by saying I'm not a huge ""chain"" restaurant fan nor am I a huge fan of most Pizzas. OK having gotten that out of my system... We got to CPK which is on the opposite end of the mall. I was already hangry but felt very depressed when I saw (literally) 50 people standing at the entrance!! I walked in to see the hostess and asked how long the wait was for 2... She said it is about an hour!! I looked at my friend and said forget it!! Then the hostess said if we sat at the bar it was first come first serve! I said great! So we grabbed the last 2 seats and proceeded to order. Then our bartender said, ""Just to let you know the wait time for food has been approximately 35-45 minutes!""... I looked at my friend and said well so much for eating here!! We had a salon appointment in about an hour!! So my friend asked if we could just get our ""Free Small Plate"" and the bartender said, ""Sure, but u have to buy $15 minimum purchase!""... Sigh. So we left. We decided to come back to CPK that same night to try it!! This time it wasn't crowded at all!! But we decided we still wanted to sit at the bar since the wait time was still 10 minutes for a booth. Here's what I ordered: -Jamabalaya Fettuccini -Shaved Mushroom + Spinach Flatbread -Sangria Flight Jambalaya Fettuccini - $18.99. (2 stars). First off I have to say my Fettuccini was cooked al dente so I was happy with that! This dish comes with Blackened Chicken (which I asked to be removed... if it's not fried or grilled I do not heart chicken!!)...  Shrimp, Andouille Sausage, Crawfish, Tasso Ham, and a Cajun sauce. I was ecstatic that I didn't have to peel my own mudbugs (aka Crawfish)!! There were about 8 shrimps in my dish which I thought was a lot. The Andouille Sausage was a bit of a downer just because I have had Andouille Sausage straight from Louisiana and it's amazing!! This Sausage just tasted like something bought from Safeway. Not awful but no real seasoning or SPICINESS!!??? Yes, I know, stupid me comparing genuine authentic items to a chain restaurant's version!! GRUNT!! The Cajun sauce did have a kick. But it mostly just tasted like Tabasco and a hint of cayenne pepper?? I wouldn't order this dish again. Shaved Mushroom + Spinach Flatbread - $7.99. (3 stars). I'm not a flatbread person but since my friend chose this as our Free Small Plate... I decided to try a small piece. For $7.99 this is a wicked awesome deal!! This could be a meal in and of itself!! I have gathered from eating with my ""Thin crust Pizza snob buddies"" that flatbreads should be closer to CRISPY?? Well CPK's wasn't terribly CRISPY but a cross between thin crust and hand tossed.  I will say that CPK piled this flatbread with tons of mushrooms which I did like!! I hope they can keep up with their consistency because if I come back with the BF I'm sure he will notice if he gets shorted ingredients!! LOL! Definitely worth ordering this plate especially to share!! Sangria Flight - $9.99. (3 stars). I love ordering drink samplers!! It gives me an idea of what to order next! In this case I was surprised to see a Sangria sampler!! The price point was worth it to me.  The Sangria Flight comes with Beehive, Berry, and Orchard. I started with the Beehive (White Wine, Cointreau, Monin Lavender, Strawberry purée, honey, and lemon.) This drink was wicked light and refreshing. For better or worse I couldn't taste the alcohol in any of these drinks!! Berry (Red Wine, Remy VSOP, Monin Blackberry, Raspberry purée, cranberry juice, and lemonade. Typical Sangria I'm used to. Tasted like drinking juice.  Orchard (White Wine, St. Germain Edelflower, Monin Stone Fruit, Orange & Cranberry juice. I liked this Sangria the best just because it was so different!! This drink taste like peaches!! Light and refreshing! --- All in all, CPK is average food with wicked cool bartenders. Parking is ample and on-site. Right now due to construction the parking lot is a maze but it will get better!! Sit at the bar if you can. I prefer to. Service is quick and friendly. Although hearing all the managers argue with each other was awkward!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kapolei?start=40,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004

Normally I don't go to a restaurant before they've reached atleast a month opened because service can be horrible. But that's not the case for this place. Came in with a family of 6 the wait was about 10 minutes this was on a Thursday night 5pm. Our waitress Jen lo. (I think) was awesome very friendly and not too upbeat . She was very considerate about giving us time to decide what we wanted. I ordered the garlic cream fettuccine with sautéed mushrooms and it was amazing!!! Lots of flavor nothing over powering. Kudos to the chef!!! Not sure how long they'll be giving complimentary artichoke dip for first time customers but that was a plus ! I honestly don't have anything bad to say about this establishment.

Thursday night, 6:22pm. 50 minute wait for first available seating. Seated outdoors at 7:15pm.  Luckily, we were seated outside which seemed a little more quiet than the inside. Comfy chairs with pillow were 5 star for me at that point. DRINKS: Strawberry Mango Cooler- refreshing! yum! I savored it though out the night because it not refillable.  Frozen Strawberry Lemonade- beautiful and the bomb! Also non refillable. But I think it be well worth buying another! Lol! STARTERS:  Spinach Artichoke Dip- good size, you'll need to ask for more chips Tortilla Egg Rolls- i did not expect to like these as I do not like egg rolls at all. we got (2 choices) Thai chicken, YUM! Mediterranean Veggie- THAT WAS AMAZEBALLS!!! If you like mushrooms, you will absolutely Love these egg rolls! I think the torilla wrap made all the difference for me.  ENTRÉES: Adult size Mac & Cheese- This was the biggest disappointment. we got our toddler the adult size so that she could share with her brother.  Well the plate was bigger than she was but the PORTION GIVEN WAS SO INCREDIBLY LITTLE she finished it on her own. We've had this dish before at other CPKS, and this was the smallest portion we've ever gotten. I almost said something, but I didnt. Felt kinda ripped off.  Garlic Creamy Fettuccine with Chicken, Shrimp and Mushrooms- I swapped fettuccine for spaghetti. Excellent Ribeye- served on a cutting board. There was a spice to it I couldn't exactly place, but my son enjoyed it. The only thing was the SALAD NEEDED MORE DRESSING.  Shrimp Scampi Zucchini- this was a surprisingly light dish for a ""scampi.""  Bolognese Pasta- looked really DRY with not much meat.  Cedar Plank Salmon- Charred and OVERDONE  SERVICE: Despite the recent openning, the servers were very attentive and accommodating. Water was refilled, every request granted with a smile, they were all great!  BIRTHDAY TREAT:  Vanilla Caramel Sunday with walnuts and a song! It was lovely So ALL IN ALL it was an okay first visit. Definitely some of the food was amazing, and some were lacking in the biggest way. My biggest gripe is the incredibly SMALL PORTIONS of PASTA entrées on such a big rimmed plate.  My daughter's Mac n Cheese being such a small portion, paying the adult price so she could share with my son... I kinda am mad at myself for not saying anything, but oh well. Next time I know.

It's at the far left side of the mall and is fairly big and very modern. Indoor and outdoor seating is available and a large rectangular bar you can sit at as well. Me and my friend checked in at around 8:45pm and were texted 5 minutes later for our table. It was still a pretty busy night for a Thursday at that late of an hour surprisingly. Our waitress was super sweet and very informative when we asked questions about their new seasonal items. The bar manager even came to talk story with us to see how we were doing. This was a nice added touch that we noticed, at other restaurants the managers do come up to see how we are doing but only to ask the usual questions ""How is everything tonight? Good? Good."" It was nice to see a pleasant face that wanted to really see how we were doing instead of a robot. Each part of our meal from our drinks, to the appetizer, and the meal were all brought out in a timely manner. Our waitress always made sure our drinks were filled and if we wanted more bread. Drinks Very Berry Sangria and Strawberry Lemonade Awesome drinks! Appetizer Artichoke Dip Always amazing, I don't think you can ever go wrong with this dish Entrees The Original BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad Salad was dry, very little dressing. but at least had other flavors in it so it wasn't as bad Garlic Cream Fettucine with Chicken The noodles were a bit undercooked (it was still hard...I don't mean al dente hard, I mean I had to pry it out of my teeth hard) Fire-Grilled Rib Eye Steak (medium) It was very heavily salted but still a good piece of meat -- this is weird of me to say only because if you know me I love my salty foods. But this steak on one side was very heavily salted but the other end was salted just right. I suppose you can't get it perfect every time.

The worker at the door tells me the staff are all new so they're very slow.  Why would CPK bring in inexperienced servers to work in a new restaurant? Isn't that what soft openings are for? Anyway. He asked for my cell phone number so they can text me when my table was ready. I waited for 25 minutes and ended up leaving.

It was a 40 min wait for my party of 10 which was reasonable but the wait turned out longer because to text notification was received. When I followed up with staff at the entrance, they were confused and claimed they had sent a text. I quickly answered and showed that no text was received. When we were shown to our table, I was given a table for 8.  We ordered about 11 items on the menu including 4 pasta dishes, a ribeye steak, a couple of pizzas, the chx Moroccan salad and the bbq chx salad. All but the ribeye steak came out within reasonable time. The chx moroccan salad came out with no chx. chx tequila fettucine pasta was hard.  Half way done with the our meals, i followed up with our server (Kami) and what it appears to be happening was the steak was being sent with another order. Most of my party was done eating and no steak yet. You could see the miscommunication between the kitchen staff and the servers.  A lot of food was coming out, but our steak was being sent to another table. Kami apologized for the wait and said that management from the kitchen will stop to apologize. No management from the kitchen ever came by. I appreciate that the bar manager(Eve or Eva) that evening came out of her way to help Kami remedy our situation.

375,Donna Lyn B.,"O‘ahu, HI",307,266,1433.0,4.0,2016-10-17,"On a Sunday night I asked for a table for two and the hostess tells me it'll be a 1.5 hour to 2 hour wait for a table in their dining room, but there's no wait to eat at the bar.  My husband and I opted to dine at the bar area and it worked out well because the two men behind the bar were attentive and checked up on us, the food came out fast, and we got to watch ""The Simpsons"" show on one of the flat TV screens above our heads.  We ordered our usual favorites like the Avocado Egg Rolls and Thai Crunch Salad.  My husband ordered the Two-in-a-Bowl soups and he said he like the Tortilla Soup better than the pea soup because the pea soup tasted ""too earthy"".  We also split a Garlic Chicken pizza and we shared the Butter Cake.  I wish the pizza had more caramelized onions.  Butter Cake was a great ending to our meal.  Everything had the same taste and presentation like the other CPK restaurants we've dined at.  However, the seating of guests in the dining room with the more than an hour wait time is questionable to me because as we sat at the bar, I saw at least two two-top tables and three four-top tables empty in the dining room and they were not filled right away.  By the end of our meal I saw two four-top tables that were never occupied the whole time we were there.  If we chose to wait, I'm sure we would have been seated earlier within an hour.  I also saw friends who were seated outside with their large party after waiting for 1.5 hours to be seated.  They were not happy because it was taking a long time for their food to make it to their table, they were given a wrong order for a pasta dish, and were still waiting for the right order to get to them.  It seems inconsistent for us at the bar to get our food sooner than my friend's party that was seated way before we were.  I would have been happier to be seated at a table and to see two empty tables the whole time kind of annoys me and makes me wonder if the hostesses at the front really know how to accurately gauge wait times for smaller parties.  It's understandable that larger parties need to wait long, but for two or four people they could have easily been seated within an hour.  Maybe that's just a kink they need to work out since they've only been open for less than a month.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kapolei?start=180,3.32,3.32,3.32,2.8640000000000003,3.3200000000000003
350,Ashley S.,"Honolulu, HI",250,243,44.0,2.0,2016-10-17,"Chose to eat here with some family and friends last night, in celebration of our friend's birthday. We expected that there would be a really long wait determined by the amount of people that were waiting outside as we first pulled into the parking lot. Was told that the wait would be about 80mins and for a party of 7, we thought it was expected. Thankfully they have some seating areas near by, so we sat near the fountain which kept my 5 year old busy. We saw a lot people being seated, as well as people who came after us. Kept having to check in with the hostess to see what was the hold up and finally after waiting for over an hour, we got a table.  Server came and got our drinks and we placed or orders right away cause we knew that it was gonna take awhile due to how long we had to wait for our table, and also with the fact that we understood that the place was pretty new, so the kitchen staff would take long as well. We got our complimentary bread and oil, which we pretty much murdered cause we were all starving. Then our appetizers....then another hour later, we finally got our food. I ordered my son a meat sauce pasta, so I was quite confused to see that they brought out a plate with just plain pasta and placed it in front of him. I waited as they were giving everyone else their food, thinking that maybe the had the sauce separately and I would have to pour it on myself. But nope, that wasn't the case. We notified the server that I ordered a meat sauce pasta, and he said, 'Okay, I'll check up on that'..and mind you the server that took the plate away was not our server. He then came back a minute or two later to tell us that it's a buttered sauce that was ordered and not the meat sauce. We still proceeded to tell him that it was meat sauce that was ordered, so he took it back to the kitchen. The kitchen was nearby, so we could see that he printed out the receipt to show the manager what was ""ordered"" like it was such a hassle to take a ladle to scoop up some sauce and pour it onto the pasta. While they were doing that, another server came to our table with another plate of buttered pasta and pizza (same pizza that my husband ordered and already was eating)...so on top of them giving the wrong type of pasta, there was more miscommunication with the staff cause double orders were made. Still, waiting for my son's food, he was so hungry so I fed him some of my pasta in the meantime. They were still trying to figure out what the hell to do with his pasta, cause they were still talking to the manager...which I cant figure why it was taking so long cause all we were doing was adding on meat sauce to the pasta...there wasnt gonna be a change in the price of his food cause they wouldve all been the same price. So many minutes later, they finally come with his food and he started to chow.  Dont get me wrong, the food was good. My husband's pizza was a little hard, and our friend's salmon was on the dry side. Service was the only thing that brought this place down. Sure, the space is huge, thank goodness, cause their Ala Moana and Pearlridge location is quite small.

Since it was new, we expected it to be a little busy, but we came for lunch and there was plenty of bar seating so we sat right down. The bartenders were nice, but they seemed a little more concerned with cleaning the bar for the night shift than helping customers as we ordered a salad and a sandwich and a guy next to us who had come in about an hour after us and ordered a well done ribeye steak and both of our orders came out at the same time.... I think they lost our ticket because the food took 45 minutes to come out. After 45 minutes of waiting we finally asked where our food was and was told it'd be out soon before she went and finally checked on it. When my friend's salad finally came out it was wrong and she had to wait again for them to fix it. When we did finally get our correct food it was delicious!

93,Anna N.,"Honolulu, HI",40,55,380.0,5.0,2016-10-19,"This may be my favorite CPK location to go to! Because of the service I've had, along with the food I've tried, and the aesthetics of the place inside and out, it made me want to come back for more! This CPK location is located in the new mall in Kapolei/West O'ahu called Ka Makana Ali'i. It is also located right near the new Olino Consolidated Theatre. I felt like there were limited parking spaces for such a big shopping center... Besides that, the wait to get a seat inside CPK wasn't that long! I came around 2pm on a Wednesday and requested for a table for 2. The hostess said the wait would take about 15 minutes for indoor seating (you can choose between outdoor and indoor seating), so she took down my name and phone number on an iPad, and told me I'd receive a text when our table would be ready. I sat and waited inside since there was air condition lol! 5 minutes later, I got the text that my table was ready, so another hostess guided us to our table. I was soooooo excited when she seated my friend and I at a booth table, enough to fit 4-6 people.. Even though I was a party of 2, and saw a couple empty seats for 2 as well. It's like this hostess knew I preferred the booths :') she also proceeded to give us the menus to browse over before our server came to retrieve our orders.  My server went by the name ""Pebbles"", and took our drink orders and appetizers first. I got a Mango Lemonade (~$4), which she happily let me know it's free refills, and I also got the Spinach Artichoke Dip (~$11.50)! She brought out 2 waters, the lemonade, and complimentary bread promptly, and that's when I placed my order on the meal. My friend got the Roasted Garlic Chicken ($19.99) and I got the Garlic Cream pasta with penne instead of the usual fettuccine (~$13.50), and added on chicken (+$3) and sautéed mushrooms (+$1.50). My friend was nuts for ordering all the add-ons for me T_T I would have simply went for only the pasta because honestly, I thought it was a bit too pricy for the portions I received at other locations I've tried at before.  The Spinach Artichoke Dip came out shortly after, and presentation of it was like nothing I've seen at other locations... Or maybe it's been a long time since I've been to CPK hahaha. The bowl of dip is in the middle of a larger bowl with tortilla chips surrounding it! Yummy. My friend and I devoured that thing in less than a few minutes!! The wait for the meals took a little longer, I'd say ~20-30 minutes.  Pebbles was nice enough to let us know it'll be out shortly, and she'll check on the status of it. She came right back with my friend's chicken and a plate of Garlic Cream FETTUCCINE with the add-ons... She said the cooks mistakenly made fettuccine instead of the penne I ordered :'( but that my penne should be coming soon. She was so nice though, that she gave the plate to me for free! I was really hesitant to take it, but who can say no to free food?! I ended up eating the fettuccine instead, and had the penne packed to-go.  While my friend and I were still eating, Pebbles gave us a dessert menu to look over. I got the Red Velvet Cheesecake ($7.99) with Haagen-Daz Vanilla Ice Cream added on for $1.50 more. I love that dessert so much!! Especially the white chocolate swirls, and with the ice cream makes it perfect for a dessert :'d My friend really enjoyed his Roasted Garlic Chicken (pan-sautéed chicken breast in lemon-garlic sauce with potatoes, cauliflowers, and Brussels sprout). It came with 2 small pieces of chicken though.. I didn't think it was worth the price, but he said he liked it and thought it was worth it. So I'll just take his word for it.  My friend also pointed out the songs that were playing in the restaurant, and I loved it! Great songs were being played, in genres I normally wouldn't listen to. Like James Bay soothing music! I also noticed there was bar section with basketball playing on TV. Didn't know CPK had a bar! Throughout the entire dining experience, Pebbles checked up on us each time to see if we liked the complimentary bread, the mango lemonade, the appetizer, our meal, and to let her know if I wanted my dessert packed to-go if I couldn't finish it. She would always refill my friend's water before it went completely empty. She refilled my lemonade twice, and asked me if I wanted one to-go. With such a positive, genuine attitude and consistent service, I decided to tip her 30%! Upon leaving, one of the hostess held the door for us and all the hostesses greeted us farewell with ""have a great day!""

I knew CPK opened a few weeks before but everyone I knew said to wait it out till they got in the groove of things just as any new establishment. Came to front and was greeted by the hostess Dani. She was very informative and told us that the wait would be a hour and half minute wait. I was hesitant at first but I said why not since it would give me and my girlfriend time to look around the mall and told her if anything opened up sooner please let us know. So we walked and after about 40-50 mins came back since it was Sunday and majority of the mall was closing. Snagged a seat right next to the check-in table and Dani was there again, asked if we could see a menu while we waited and after 5 mins she was able to get us seated right away which was perfect! She sat us in the back near the take-out area and told us that our servers name was ""Amber"" and that she'll be assisting us tonight Amber first came and introduced herself was very attentive and took our order for drinks and apps. When she came back she informed us that they had ran out of bread but me and my girlfriend said it was fine since we know it was a busy place. Ordered the friend mac n cheese and it was good and ordered the lettuce wrap. Amber then left and checked up on us frequently and we then decided to share a asian chicken salad. The Mac N cheese and salad came out before the lettuce wrap and amber apologized for that since she inputted the Mac N Cheese and Wraps  before she even inputted the salad. She also tipped us on the CPK app to let us know about discounts and other things which was useful as we waited. The Asian Chicken Salad was so good you gotta try that for sure. The Pizza's were goos just as you would expect a CPK pizza to be. Dessert came along and the Pumpkin cheese cake and the  pound cake w/ice cream just topped the night with great food and service. Out of all the CPK's on island this is my favorite and most definitely will be going back for everything.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kapolei?start=280,3.12,3.12,3.12,2.612,3.1200000000000006
383,Veronica L.,"Ewa Beach, HI",442,228,739.0,2.0,2016-10-25,"DISCLAIMER:  I am basing this review solely on my experience ordering take-out. My parents really wanted to go out to eat at the new CPK but when my step-dad called ahead, he was told it would be an hour and 45-minute to 2-hour wait and they don't take reservations.  Being accustomed to CPK, I said why not order ahead and just go pick it up. Simple enough, right?  Wrong. While attempting to use the website to place our order (which I had done at other CPKs), I was met with an error that that particular restaurant was not accepting online orders and that I should call. Okay, fair enough. They are new enough that I could expect that not everything is up and running. So I proceeded to call the restaurant...here we go. I spent over 10 minutes on hold - I was put there by 3 DIFFERENT people before someone finally got on the line to take my order. Every time someone answered, they put me on hold again and again. I was finally able to place our order and when I asked how long it would take before it was ready, the lady stated 45 minutes because ""the food was coming out slow"" that night. But she assured me that she would call my phone number provided should our food be ready before then. I let her know I lived in Ewa so it would take a few minutes.  Needless to say, I never received a call.  When we got to the restaurant, we still had to wait for our order. To add insult to injury, they had run out of their complimentary bread and made no attempt to offer us something else instead. Service was slow and sub-par. Although not incorporated into my review, rumor has it they work their emloyees like crazy and don't let them have breaks. That's not cool. The food was about the only good thing. But hey, CPK is CPK. Of course I'll eat there again, but only because I like the food.

Forgot utensils & napkins, we had to ask for it later. Waiter took about 10 minutes to come to us as she was chatting with a friend that was there on another table she was serving. Then finally came to take our orders. Then took another 10 minutes to bring our waters, no other drinks just water. Out of 4 of us took about 40 minutes or so for us to get our food.

348,Nichelle M.,"Ewa Beach, HI",57,2,,2.0,2016-10-28,"First thing I noticed as I walked along the window of the restaurant was wow it shouldn't be to long of wait since I saw at least 8 open tables inside the restaurant and another 3-4 in the outdoor seating. Come to find out our friends who got there first and checked in said it would be a 40-50 min wait. We knew there would be a wait and just accepted it. 50 min went by and we still didn't get the text alert so we went to check in with the hostess to see what the status was. There was 4 more people ahead of us (all parties of 2-4). As I did another stroll along the windows I still saw at least 5 tables open in inside with 2-3 that needed to be cleaned up. The automatic answer if you question the open tables was ""we don't want to overload the kitchen"". If you question that response you will quickly get ""would you like to speak to a manager"". So apparently their kitchen can't handle a full house and if you come to this location you will most likely see many open tables and have an hour long wait. After maybe 5-10 min then we were seated. And guess what?! It was at one of the open tables I had seen earlier. The food is still same quality if went to any of the other locations.

Let me tell you how our night went! Pros- They text you when your table is ready! So now you can go shopping at the mall anywhere and just come back quickly when you are ready!       - The tables outside were really nice and with the cool breeze made it a nice night to have dinner outside. Cons- The wait for 3 adults and 2 children at 5 o'clock on a weekend was over an hour         - My friends ordered a margarita- Now I don't know much about using ""top Shelf"" alcohol but this margarita came in a shot glass..... which he drank in a shot....... because it came ina shot glass...with ICE!!!!!!!  So the next drink he asked for it to come with no ice as you are barely getting any drink when it is in a double shot glass with ice.... It came half full.... when we spoke to the manager she stated that the alcohol is strictly measured out and without the ice the drink looks small.... I told the manager they should rename the drink and asked how much each drink was... 12.00!!!! I about fainted..... I can go to Ruby Tuesday and get a real Margarita and upsize the think for like 10.00 I think!!        - To top it off the food took about an hour to get to us...... My soup which I ordered as an appetizer came after my entrée, because they forgot and here's the best part!!! Another manager who knows how many CPK has on hand came over and told us "" See that large table over there.... well sir your steak accidently went to them..... but we are making you a new one and it should be out in about 15 minutes.""  Mind you this was after we had all, already gotten done eating.  Who tells the customer that there steak is being eaten by the guy next to him!

We arrived and there was a line.  We were surprised as we were only 10 minutes past opening time, but alas, we figured it would be busy anyway.  We moved up the line in a reasonable amount of time and they took our name and number, saying they'd text us.  We chose to stand around nearby since we didn't think the 20 minute wait was worth going to walk around.  We'd do that afterwards!   There is an indoor area, bar area, and a patio area.  Some people did choose the patio area, though we did not want to sit outside - it was a hot day and it was lunch time.  The place looks pleasant and I would consider it for dinner. After being seated, we saw that there was a new menu item for rib eye and that made my boyfellow very happy.  He ordered that in a jiffy while I ordered the California Club pizza, which is a departure from my normal staples.  We also got a free small plate (one of the flatbreads) with our Pizza Dough app.  I was happy with the flatbread but it had spinach, so boyfellow doesn't eat it.   Our server was very much ""on it"" with my boyfellow's refills and even my slower-drunk water with no ice.  I always emphasize that I don't want ice and I do judge on whether anyone bothers to refill my water AND/OR refills it with ice water.  Our server was very friendly, polite, and exceedingly attentive.  :)   We also ordered butter cake, of which I devoured of course.  Sadly, this butter cake was not up to par with the other butter cakes I have ordered, but it isn't bad either.  It just wasn't quite as moist - but there are always off days, I suppose.  That will not stop me from ordering it next time!

32,Isa R.,"Honolulu, HI",389,332,833.0,5.0,2016-11-03,"Located in the brand new mall in Kapolei, less than 5 minutes away from my house.  You can bet I'll be here often.  Way too often.  During the day, there's ample parking, and I like that they have reserved stalls near to the takeout entrance so you can quickly run in and out for takeout. This is one of the larger CPK locations that I've ever been to.  Much nicer in design than the Ala Moana and Pearlridge locations.  Keep in mind, that even though there my be empty tables, they purposefully don't seat everyone so that the entire restaurant is at capacity.  This is so the kitchen doesn't get overloaded with people all ordering at the same time.  Hopefully, this is something they will slowly do away with once they get into the swing of things, but we'll see. We arrived at 1:30 PM on a weekday, and we were seated in less than 5 minutes!  We could have been seated quicker as there was more than 1 empty table, but as I said, they like to stagger seat times so that the kitchen doesn't get bombarded.  I had read other yelp reviews of people having 1.5 hour waits, so 5 minutes is NOT a problem for me.  I like that they offer to text you when your table is ready, that way if you are quoted a really long wait time, at least you can walk around the mall instead of being confined near the entrance with those buzzers that only work within X feet of the restaurant entrance. For the appetizers, we had the half Caesar salad, the Hawaii exclusive ahi egg rolls, and the avocado club egg rolls.  I don't think we'll be ordering the Caesar again, but just remember that their salad portions are HUGE.  A half portion is a regular sized salad at any other restaurant.  I really loved the ahi tuna egg rolls.  The avocado club egg rolls are my absolute favorite, but the ahi tuna egg rolls have a different flavor.  Try both if you can!   For my entree, I had the garlic cream fettucine with chicken, shrimp, mushrooms, AND avocado on top.  I've been ordering this for years.  I never try anything else, because it's always so good.  One of my absolute favorite foods to eat.  Another reason why I love dining in at CPK vs. takeout?  The unlimited bread + bottomless strawberry lemonades.   The food at CPK is always consistent, which is part of the reason it's one of my favorite restaurants.  The quality of food here is on par with the other CPKs on island, and the service was really prompt and friendly.  The food came out really quickly, appetizers out in less than 10 minutes, entrees out in less than 10 after the appetizers were finished. I was scared to come here after hearing the wait times, but if you go for a later lunch on a weekday, it's not bad at all.  I'll definitely be back, and back again, and back again after that.  ;) PS: If CPK isn't doing specials on gift cards, Costco sells $100 worth of gift cards for $80.  Even if you're not giving them to a friend, buy them for yourself if you're going to end up coming here a lot!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kapolei?start=40,3.04,3.04,3.04,3.0280000000000005,3.0400000000000005

Finally a CPK on the west side of Oahu!!  I dreamt of days when CPK would open up on the west side of Oahu, and those dreams of driving less than 10 minutes to CPK has finally been answered!  CPK is my go to spot, whenever my friends/family want to go out to dinner and don't know really where to go, CPK would be the best option. It caters to all ages. With a kids menu, to small bites for a snack, huge portions for shareable dishes, and desserts to drool over.  I am seriously in love with this location!! The ambience doesn't feel like the CPK in Pearlridge and in Ala Moana! There's a bit of an industrial look to it, and hints of a ""Hawaii"" theme scattered around the restaurant.  There is outdoor and indoor seating for your preference.  Another thing that sets this location apart is that they send out text messages to you while you wait. So no more of that short distance buzzers that keeps you anticipating while watching people go in and out of the restaurant!  Since this place is still new and closer to those that live on the west side, we anticipated a long wait, so the 1 hour wait didn't surprise me and my friend.

Before I forget, I ordered their tequila pasta thing with mushrooms, and they basically forgot the mushrooms and our server had to bring it on the side, which also came cold.  After several bites into my meal, I noticed hair in my pasta and immediately sent it back to the kitchen, which took another 10 minutes for them to replace.  Oh, and they forgot the mushrooms.. again.  By then, I had lost my appetite and packed the entire meal to go.  The manager offered free butter cake for the hair in my food.  Unfortunately, the cake didn't do a good job of cleansing my palette of the very poor experience I had just received.  The only saving grace of eating here was our server who kept apologizing profusely for all of the dinner mishaps.   Would I eat here again?  Probably not.  Don't get me wrong, I love CPK.  Just not this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kapolei?start=160,2.84,2.84,2.84,2.5320000000000005,2.84

363,Shanelle C.,"Honolulu, HI",3,5,,1.0,2016-11-07,"Terrible. I'm not sure if it's because the mall itself is new which can only mean new employees with less experience in the service industry, but this establishment needs a lot of work service wise.  My friend and I decided to try the new CPK and it was a plus to drive out to this new location to browse the shops and see what this place had to offer. We checked in with a lady at the front and she told us our wait would be at least 60 to 75 minutes. Luckily we weren't very hungry at the time, so we didn't really mind. She took down my name and number and said I would receive a text when our table was ready.  What put me off at first was seeing all the open and clean tables in the outside seating area (visible from the mall/walkway near the shops). If there were so many open tables, why was our wait so long? Well, whatever. My friend and I looked through a few shops then decided to just sit and wait until I got the text. The total amount of time we waited was 90 minutes.  When we were seated, to my surprise, there was about 5-6 empty & clean tables inside! This annoyed me a bit. It took about 10 mins for someone to acknowledge us. By this time, my friend and I had already decided what we wanted to order. Our server finally came over and introduced herself and she took our order. Our waters took another 10 minutes, served by someone who wasn't even our server. Throughout our whole dining experience, we saw our server 3 times. Once to take our order, once for us to ask for (what I thought was complimentary, at least it was at other locations) bread/butter, and at the end of meal for our check. Everything else including receiving our entrees, taking away our plates were from all various people.  I understand that a lot of restaurants don't have one specific server or that you'll have many different servers/food runners, but what really put me off was seeing employees- employees who were on the clock- sit down at what at first looked like customer's tables, eating off their plates, sharing food. I can only assume it was an employee who came in on his time off to eat dinner there and his friends/coworkers were stopping by periodically to sit down, chit chat, and eat. I thought this was extremely unprofessional, but that's just me.  Waiting 90 minutes for the service we got? I'll pass and probably never return to this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kapolei?start=260,2.64,2.64,2.64,2.5320000000000005,2.64

I sat there and waited......and waited....... At 8:35 pm I told A.J. to cash me out for my 2 beers. As he was doing that my food arrived. I was already standing and waiting to pay. I gave a $10.00 tip for 2 beers since A.J. was excellent. I then asked to speak to the manager. Patrick came behind the bar and asked me ""what""... I told him I waited 35 minutes for a chicken dinner and he told me I can take my food ""to-go"". I informed him I am staying next door at the hotel and I eat dinners in restaurants not hotel rooms. Patrick then turned around and walked away. As soon as he thought I wasn't going to be a regular he couldn't care less.

She knew the menu and knew exactly what to recommend (I mentioned my favorite drink that they no longer offer and she recommended an alternative that would be even better! And it was! She also mentioned to my husband that he could get Half of the pizza he normally orders and Half of another pizza he really wanted to try, which worked out perfectly. He loved that idea and has now found another favorite thanks to Alice!) she also payed attention to the little things also like bringing more bread over when we finished or offering more water when finished with our drinks and just the overall attentiveness with bringing what we needed when we needed it!

Anyways, first time in CPK Kapolei and let me tell you, wow this place is huge and spacious. Open floor plan of say. There was the four of us and the wait was 45 mins...... kinda expected that since it's fairly new and it was a Sunday night. My friends and I didn't mind, they said they will text us when our table is ready. So we decided to walk around the new Ka Makana Alii mall and just see what new shops were still opening and of course guessing where the new store for my job was going to be. Within 30 mins we got a text saying our table was ready. Once we got in, two girls we're in the front and they just stared at us.....expecting us to say something first. I'm sorry but if a customer walks in, proper greeting is ""hi welcome what brings you in today"". So there wasn't any greeting at all even though we put our name down 30mins ago. So my other half said kinda loudly, we got a text from you guys saying our table was ready. Girl looked at us again and then said oh let me check and your name was? She said oh ok got it.

Usually I order chicken piccata and I would eat it but I couldn't and had to take it home for the first time.  Another opportunity that the management could do is to train hostess/host properly and respectively and professional.

The review is mostly for the service which was very disappointing.  I know this is not 5 star fine dining but the experience was so awful for us I really don't care to come back.   I have been here 2 times since they open.  First time we came here as a party of 3 for late lunch on a weekday.  Wait time seating was about 30-40 minutes.  Our waitress was nice.  I had really bad heartburn from the drinks and food. Second time we came here as a party of 3 with my toddler on a Friday night.  The wait was about 20 minutes so we decided to dine here.  It's cool they incorporate texting when your table is ready, but maybe it was a mistake because the front desk seem to question if our table was ready.  They gave us a very small table outside which only had 2 chairs.  I told them my daughter did not need a high chair so they brought us another chair.  Our table didn't have utensil.   I figure they will give it later.  We got our lettuce wrap appetizer,  but still didn't get our utensils.  I had to ask for our utensils and it didn't come right away.  We finally got the rest of our food, but it was crowded on our small table.   We were eating and I saw our waitress so I ask for more lettuce.  We waited.  I saw her attending to other tables.  We were pretty much finish with our meal and the waitress did not come back!  I had drank all my water and started to drink my fiancé water.  She still didn't come back.   I talk to the manager about our waitress attentiveness.  The waitress finally came back with wet lettuce and an extra glass of water.   Now I know being a waitress can be stressful and busy.  Maybe she avoided our table because I have a toddler and my daughter was yelling for food or maybe the wait for our food was long.  The waitress seem fake and not sincere after my complaint.  I don't' think she gets customer service.  She needs to be retrained or consider another job!  I can only hope this establishment can improve in customer service.

Unfortunately ALL of them are crazy crowded (especially at peak hours) and the Kapolei one is no different.  There is absolutely no way I'm waiting an hour or two on a weekend night but I was lucky enough to stop by on a weekday during lunch. No crowd, no wait.  The food was as expected but I'm writing this review because we received excellent service. 5 stars - they only get 4 stars overall because of the usual crazy wait times and average food. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive and there was someone else, a manager maybe, who kept coming to check on us and made some good menu recommendations.  It just felt like they really wanted us to have a good time and enjoy our food. I was actually surprised because I've never had service like that at a CPK. The others are not bad... just not this good. Kudos to Kapolei CPK and their staff.

The appetizers came out faster then we both expected and the flat bread was delicious.  Amber made sure we got all the right food, and asked us if we were okay and refilled our drinks promptly.

274,Diana S.,"Kapolei, HI",73,138,1128.0,4.0,2016-12-11,"I met my two classmates for a mini reunion dinner at the recently opened California Pizza Kitchen.  It was a busy Saturday evening and the Ka Makana Ali'i Mall was filled with myriads of people celebrating the holiday season. I put our name in for seating and was informed it would be an estimated 50-minute wait.  They will get your name and phone number and text you when the next available table is open. That was fine with us, because we had a lot of catching up to do.  To our surprise our wait was just 40-minutes. Our waitress gave us our menus.  As we glanced around we all decided that this CPK is the largest on the island.  We enjoyed the appetizer of the bread with oil and balsamic vinegar.  Next, we ordered our dinner.  One of my friends really enjoyed her half-order of Thai Chicken Salad and her Roasted Garlic Chicken with Seasonal vegetables.  She liked the crunch and spiciness of her chicken salad.  She also mentioned that the Chicken was moist.  It was the first time for her to have brussel sprouts and she said it was similar to a mini cabbage.  My other friend ordered the half order of Ceasar Salad and she enjoyed it.  I purchased the Cedar Plank Salmon.  It was flavorful and it was unique that they served it on an actual charred plank on your plate.  I've had better Cedar Plank salmons before though.  In my opinion the serving size was small for the price.  It wasn't as succulent as the one as I had before, that was homemade on a grill. The succotash was delicious, though. All in all, our service was wonderful.  We all asked for separate checks and the waitress was very accommodating.  She even took photos of us on all of our cell phones at the end of our meals. She also was pleasant when we asked for take home boxes and packages for our leftovers. The food was good. My friends said their serving portions were fine and it was tasty.  I wanted a bigger salmon for the price.  Lastly, the ambiance was great for reuniting with my classmates.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kapolei?start=80,3.6,3.31,3.31,2.384,3.426

There were 5 hosts at the host stand and they were playing around so as she tried to take my number down she kept getting it wrong so I told her I'd just sit on the bench next to the host stand since it would only be 10 minutes.  20 minutes went by and a number of parties were sat so I decided to check on my place and she told me that she had attempted to call me but no reply. Although I had been sitting literally 2 feet away from her the entire time.  Another host intervened and was able to have her seat us immediately but upon seating us to our table the same host developed an attitude and felt she needed to let us know how we were at fault for waiting longer. For that, I had addressed her about her unprofessional behavior and lack of customer service at that point.  Our table was right by the bar so our view was of the host stand. So I watched her walk back and gossip to the other hosts about our table. Thus I felt that a manager needed to be notified of the situation. I am a frequent diner at CPK and have always had the best customer service experience when dinning here. So the behavior witnessed tonight was appalling and definitely ruined our experience overall since your first interaction upon entering the restaurant is with the hosts.  The manager was apologetic and I know she was not fault for their actions.

I arrived at 530 to put down our names- in hopes of being sat at 7. The hostesses in the front were very pleasant. They asked for my number so they could text me when a table would be ready and they informed me that they could only place us outside on the patio because we had a large party. Which was totally fine! At 645 I got a text saying that it would be an additional 20 minutes for a table to be ready. We didn't actually get sat til 730.  Because we were waiting long we asked the servers if we could start ordering already. They took our drink orders and appetizers. There were two servers serving our party. Our drinks came out okay, our appetizers took a while. Half of our table didn't get our appetizers or our salads. We ordered a chicken Waldorf salad with extra walnuts. When we finally got our salad, there was no CHICKEN or extra walnuts. So we asked if we could just get it on the side which they did bring out (I'll get back to that in a bit).  Most of the salads and appetizers came out after we received our entrees.  I finally got my pasta and as I was eating it I noticed a long hair entwined in my pasta. I asked to get a new one which they brought out. By the time all the food came out we were pretty frustrated with all that went on in our dining experience. Being that we are all servers ourselves we tried to be understanding. I don't usually like to come on yelp to write bad reviews but too much went on that we had to say something. We asked for boxes and they asked us if we wanted to order dessert. A couple of us decided to eat dessert so we ordered the butter cake with ice cream! YUM! BUTTT, when the butter cake came out it was COLD! The servers came around to give us our checks (we did separate checks) and when we got OURS, we got charged for that chicken ok the Waldorf salad even though it came with it. By that point we were frustrated so we asked to speak to a manager. We told the manager what had happened and she was surprised that we waited til the last minute to say something. We just told her that we really didn't wanna complain cause we know how it is as servers. She did talk to the servers from our table and she was apologetic! So these stars are there just for the manager! She fixed all of our checks.  We love coming to CPK!

Four of us out of six got their food at the same time however I had to wait at least 20 more minutes after that, and the last one of us had to wait even longer,  thus we notified our server that it was taking a long time she said oh sorry. And continued to do whatever it was. Eventually the last one of us got our food mind you was ONLY avocado eggrolls. The manager came out and apologized saying she would take the eggrolls off the bill which she did. However our waitress disappeared pretty much for the rest of the night. She took a long time to clear our plates and give us a dessert menu. Then she took forever to bring the desserts, and also another forever to give us our bill.

The dumplings were pretty good.  They didn't look that appetizing, but they had a good flavor.  My son even enjoyed them. My pasta was amazeballs.  The flavor was on point and the mushrooms were perfectly sautéed.  My husband's kung pao pasta was pretty good.  Tasted just like it sounds.  There was a good kick, but not too much as my son ate some of it no problem. My sons mac and cheese was lame.  Boxed and cheese would have been better.  Not getting that again. We ordered the butter cake because it just sounds amazing.  And it was.  It was very moist.  We didn't get ice cream with it but it probably would have been a foodgasm if we did.  I would say that it tastes just like those Dansk cookies, but better.  The one with the little crystals of sugar on top of it.  Yummy.

We had our water and bar drinks refreshed  - 2 points.  Now its time to talk about the wait.  The manager has been to our table twice as we have dined there three times, so we know she cares.  Tonight the issue was being short wait staff or proper utilization of wait staff.  There were no less than 12 -14 tables open and in the bar, the seats around the bar, more than 70% of those were empty.  When you are told you have to wait 30 minutes and it turns to 50 minutes + and the empties are staring at you, it's clear you have staffing issues.  So, we went to the bar, no seats, (and there were children ""at"" the bar"") so we stood, and ordered alochol drinks $$, and when we notice the booths were not being filled sat with our drinks but were told to stand despite the booths were not being filled.  If you can't fill dining room and outdoor tables, then let the bar booths be for drinks only, no food, as you will sell ($$$) drinks to waiting people.

The bread she choose to serve us was hard and crouton like.  We placed our regular order in with her and requested a fresher bread when it was ready. That came only just before our dinner meal of 20min arrived ( which wasn't too bad for dinner at a new place) we saw our server 3 times until the end of the meal. 1) greeting and drinks/ app  2.) ordered dinner 3) towards the end of our meal to ask us how everything was when we requested the check.   Meanwhile two others were nice and assisted us to change my husbands Diet Coke order from regular coke and kept my refills steady, got us peppers for our pizza, etc...  I was thoroughly annoyed with our current server. At the time we got our dinner she had us and one family trying to cash out. Then it was just us, and  while we were eating our dinner some younger guy probably a busser or host informed us that he was locking the inside door so we had to go out the gate to leave. Which is fine if we were done with our meal but we still need to use the bathroom and it's pretty unprofessional to inform the guests that they can't come in through the restaurant while they are still eating dinner. I believe it to be an uninformed worker, he wasn't rude. Just trying to do his job.  Our dinner was tasty, but not quite up to Pearlridge in food quality. My pizza was cut badly, one piece was so pieces and I had two tiny slices, then one was just enormous. My wife thought her pizza was pretty good just not as good as Pearlridge. We had a 10:30pm movie to catch next door so we asked for the bill. Our server packed one pizza away and left. My wife's pizza remained unboxed and we sat there waiting for a grand total of 15min to receive our check to go! My wife went inside through the server entrance to use the bathroom and the server was first just hanging out by the counter. And another just cruising on her phone. She told me she asked where our server was because we needed a box and our check and that we had s movie to go to. Instead of the other servers just bringing a box and the check, which I know they can do through the type of system they use. They went searching for our server who was no where to be found. Seemed like she forgot about us and was doing her closing duties. This is insane, can't handle one table? Your turn around table rate is so slow, which jacks up the waitlist. Because there is not enough adequately train your staff or hire those with not much service background. When she finally arrived we left as quickly as we can. The tip was as scarce as she was to our table unfortunately... new or not the service we received was terrible. We won't be returning to this location for another year or so until we have faith we can get better service and not have to wait long for every portion of the dinner. The one star is due to terrible service and wait times for every portion of the meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kapolei?start=240,2.68,2.92,2.92,2.724,2.8240000000000003

Apparently they didn't know where it was. We had to wait like 10-15 minutes to even place our food order. By the time we received our food, we'd been seated for at least 40 minutes, and my fettuccine wasn't ready for another 10 minutes. They said the kitchen was backed up.

It was a busy Wednesday night and we waited about 50mins to be seated. No server came to our table to help us or even greet us until 15 minutes later. A server, named Chelsea (I think), was kind enough to help us after she had seen us waiting for so long. She took our drink and food orders but our drinks and bread didn't get to our table until about 15-20 minutes later. I appreciate Chelsea trying to help us because we were waiting for so long but it seemed that she was too busy for us. My sister ordered some special mushroom pasta and a cup of soup on the side. A manager (I think) stopped by our table as we were waiting for our food to notify us that the soup that my sister ordered had just run out. My sister was a little bothered especially because we have been waiting for just about everything this night. A few minutes later the manager came by to tell my sister that even the pasta she had ordered also just ran out. My sister was completely frustrated at this point because she made sure they had it when she put in the order, since the last time she came they were also out. The manager offered to exchange the noodles for the dish to something else and my sister agreed to have the dish with fettuccine noodles. Our food came out and my sisters dish did not come with fettuccine noodles.  Overall we were mostly frustrated with the service we received because we were waiting an unusually long time for literally everything. I appreciate the server trying to help us but she was just too busy. It seems that everything else, like running out of certain dishes, just happened at a bad time and of course there is no one to blame for that. I did feel bad for the server because I understood it was a really busy night and some people of my party were being rude because of the service. But overall I think that this could have ended better with a sincere apology from the manager. Of course they apologized to us, but they did not recognize that we had bad service from the beginning until the end. I wish the manager would have spoken to us more and would have apologized about the horrible service rather than just apologizing for my sisters order. This experience makes me not want to come to this location again. I wish the management would look at the bigger picture and realize that either they need to hire more servers and staff or they need to retrain their staff. I feel that our visit today should have had the full attention of the manager, but it didn't, so I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't even care about these Yelp reviews.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kapolei?start=220,2.48,2.93,2.93,2.8560000000000003,2.75

Anyways, my boyfriend and I (along with 2 relatives) ate dinner here and the service was horrible. Our server was extremely nice, but it didn't make up for her inability to check up on how we were doing because we had a few complaints. Firstly, we waited about 30-45 minutes for 2 appetizers to be served; secondly, our spinach artichoke dip was not served to us because the manager served it to the wrong table (don't worry we got a discount on it); and thirdly, we waited for about an HOUR for 2 of our pasta entrees... Throughout the night, the manager was our server because he was the only person that could see us waving our hands for attention. In addition, there were about 3 servers standing around doing nothing behind the counter and one of our relative witnessed two other servers talking in the bathroom.

No need to fight any traffic and over crowding of people. We waited for about twenty minutes before we were seated, and inside is very spacious.  we ordered Avocado Eggrolls for an appetizer, which came out fairly quickly, never a disappointment those egg rolls YUM. our waitress did mention that it would be a few minutes before any complimentary bread came out as they were still baking, those never came though. It was okay because service was very prompt and we received our Entrees.  I ordered Shrimp Fettuccine, one of the go to's at CPK, i was about Two-thirds through my meal when i noticed a hair in my entree. i know that it is never purposely done, so  i would never get upset about something like that, but i quickly became nauseous as i the thought of me eating almost the whole meal before finding it. I showed to waitress, and she immediately felt remorseful, but don't worry girl, it's no ones fault. She offered to have another one made but I was already full and would feel terribly bad having them make another. A few minutes later i believe we were greeted by the Manager on duty and he also felt bad and offered to comp the meal.   we also ordered a take out dish, for someone who couldn't join us, we ordered the Kung Pao Chicken no peanuts, due to allergies. upon arriving home though with our take put, i realized there was peanuts in the dish. bummer, as we weren't going to chance trying to pick out the peanuts and still consume the meal. Still, mistakes happen we definitely should have checked the dish before leaving the restaurant, so that was a downer.  we still opted to have dessert, after all I absolutely love the butter cake, which was amazing as always.  I love CPK and i love the convenience of the location although it may take me some time to work up an appetite to eat there again.  on the plus side, staff was really attentive and nice, and service was quick, so we still enjoyed ourselves, and we appreciated how professional and caring the staff was towards the mishap. we will surely be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kapolei?start=160,2.32,2.95,2.95,2.9880000000000004,2.6980000000000004

I decided to check out the new location close to my house out here in Kapolei. I heard it has been busy so I decided to go later in the evening on a Sunday night. Fingers were crossed hoping that it would be slow. I was wrong. The wait time that I was quoted was 1.5 hours. The host who quoted me the wait time was very friendly and happy. She took down my name and cell number and mentioned that I would receive a text once my table was ready. It ended up being only a hour wait so I was pleased.  I love the atmosphere of this location. It is dimly lit with plenty of seating options ranging from tables, booths and bar seating. One thing I was a little unimpressed with was the fact that our waitress switched out mid order. We had no idea until we flagged someone down and asked if someone could take our order. It was then disclosed that we had a new waitress and our initial waitress had ""gone home for the night"". Otherwise, the food was great and the new sangria (I want to say it was a strawberry flavor) was to die for. I had 5 total !! woot woot!

Twice since my initial visit the waitstaff have been attentive and orders arrived promptly. Wait times are manageable and a text alerts you when your table is ready; much better than carrying around a giant 80s pager. Roast halibut is good; I had chicken piccata which was good. The drinks are refilled promptly and the servers are all very efficient now.

She offered no incentive for us to return like most managers do (10%off order, a free dessert, etc.). She's lucky we like the food haha.

He stopped by a few more times throughout lunch to check on us, that is what management is supposed to looked like (TAKE NOTES EWA BEACH APPLEBEE'S).

Almost 90% of the time, the service has been horrible. I've never been here when it's super packed or busy, and yet my food is ALMOST ALWAYS cold. I'll ask the servers for straws or balsamic vinegar and they say they'll bring it, but they will forget. Water or beverage glasses are empty, and they won't get refilled unless I flag someone down.  The last time I ordered takeout, I asked for my Cremini mushroom pasta without Parmesan cheese, and they had covered the pasta with it. I had to give it to someone else to eat because I am lactose intolerant. I ordered food for five people and everything except for one of the pizzas were all cold.  Tonight, I tried to call in an order again. My call was first answered by a man named David. He transferred me to Kay, who put me on hold. I called while exiting Target Kapolei and I was still on hold when I got to the hosting area at CPK. I called for a manager and showed him that I was still on hold. He verified my phone and indeed saw that what I had explained was true. I walk over to the takeout ordering station and am helped by the same Kay, who had me on hold for almost 14 minutes. She and three other employees are not helping anyone, but are socializing amongst each other. Once my order is finally placed, she tells me that I will have to wait almost 25 minutes for my food. I tried to avoid this wait time by trying to call into the establishment in the first place. I didn't even receive a decent apology. This place is a complete joke. I think I might just drive down to the Pearlridge location or avoid this place altogether.  SAME DAY UPDATE: I ordered the Garlic Cream Fettucine with Chicken and Shrimp, Wild Mushroom Strozzapreti, Thai Chicken Pizza, Lettuce Wraps with Chicken AND a Spinach Artichoke Dip. They forgot to give me my Spinach Artichoke Dip... I called the restaurant back almost immediately after I came home. Kay answered the phone, apologized when I told her an item was missing and transferred me over to her manager David, who tried to help me sort this out (I guess).

The quality of the food is typical of all CPKs, tasted good and not too overpriced for my wallet.   The quality of service on the other hand was lacking.  They're either understaffed (according to them), or under-trained, or maybe both. Firstly, our table wasn't set with any napkins or flatware.  We didn't receive them until after we ordered and gotten the house bread.  And even then, there were only 2 napkins for 4 people.  Secondly, our server looked like she needed a pick me up.  No smile at all, and gave us a ""look"" when we asked for serving spoons/tongs for the full-sized salad that was to be shared among us diners.  She also seemed to have a bit of an attitude when she herself pointed out that our free birthday dessert wasn't properly deducted from the bill (to begin with it was incorrectly billed for a la mode when we didn't order it as such). Thirdly, the wait time for our food and drink refills was quite long. Lastly, we ordered the red velvet cake for the dessert, but got some other kind of cake a la mode.  Instead of telling the (different) server to take it back, we accepted because we didn't want to wait any longer for them to bring the right cake.

I was very excited to see the new mall and see the new restaurants. I love CPK as I have gone to both Ala Moana and pearl ridges and had great experiences. I couldn't wait to try the new one.          Pros: lots of parking, friendly hosts, text message when table is ready giving us time to walk around and check out the mall, the atmosphere was amazing (beautiful) and the spinach artichoke dip was delicious.   Cons:  I had a waitress who clearly did not want to be there, first off there was something floating in the tea, I ordered wine and was brought a 9oz pitcher and glass to pour myself, which would have been ok if she didn't go to the table next to me and then pour theirs for them. I felt very offended. The water was refilled twice which was awesome but no refill offered on the tea, or even asked. The Balinese pasta that I was looking forward too was over cooked and left a chalking taste in my mouth, and the salmon was raw in the middle so we didn't eat it. No dessert offered, just all around terrible service.   Conclusion:  I love CPK and hate to say this but I really hope that this gets addressed and corrected. The place looks amazing and the food presentation was great. Good drinks and mostly friendly staff. I just feel that if someone doesn't want to be there, do not force them to be as they will take out their attitude on the customer and leave us with a bad experience. Coming from a culinary family who was raised in family owned restaurants, I know that the most important thing is the guests' experience.

51,Nalani C.,"Aiea, HI",285,56,113.0,3.0,2017-02-27,"This pains me to post 3 stars and I'll probably be back to give it another try another day. The parking situation is great. Tons of parking nearby is available. The wait time wasn't bad (given we came around 430). Our waiter was very friendly. The food tasted very delicious.  So you must be wondering, with all of those wonderful tips why just 3 stars? Our food took around 45 minutes to come out. It tasted good, but when you've devoured the dip and bread and still have to wait a while...it takes up a lot of time. Especially when you have children who are hungry. They get restless and the wait seems even longer.  While waiting for our food to come out I spent a lot of time watching the surrounding area.  We were seated out on the patio and there was a lot of empty seats. A lot of empty seats when there was now a lot of parties waiting to be seated. As a customer I know that it's frustrating to have to wait a long time when you see seats empty for a long period of time. Not once did I see our waiter standing around doing nothing. Perhaps management needs to step up and have better training for the employees to get a more efficient system going.  So, what happened after we finally got our food? One of our plates were forgotten. Either not put into the computer, not made by the kitchen, etc. all excuses that shouldn't be made when your patrons already waited 45 minutes for their food. Now we had to wait even longer for that plate of food. By this time 60-70 minutes had passed.

Once seated, my family pretty much ordered the usual stuff we like.  I like the Chinese chicken salad and the Thai Pizza.  I also always get their fresh lemonade (with free refills).  Unfortunately, it was difficult at times to find our waitress to get a refill...  Anyways, the food was solid and what you'd expect.   If you're craving CPK, then this place will deliver, just be wary of the possibly wait depending on what you come, but overall a good CPK experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kapolei?start=60,3.28,3.19,3.19,2.576,3.226

There was a long wait (40 minutes for a table) and we decided to try getting bar seating. After getting seats at the bar, our drink order was taken. We tried to order our dinner quickly but with a busy bar, we did have to wait. After our order was taken, we enjoyed our drinks and after 20 minutes I wondered where our food was? I also observed several patrons that were seated after us get their food, I tried to flag down the bartender. When I finally got her attention, I asked if she could check on our food and was told ""okay."" The bartender then walked to her register and after 10 minutes came back and asked if we wanted another drink. I reminded her again about my previous request to check on our food and it was only after asking for a second time that she went to the kitchen to check on our order. After another 10 minutes, she talks to the manager and then the manager comes to talk to us. Apparently the kitchen ""lost our order""... and they are only now gonna make our food. After multiple requests to check on our food, 30-40 minute wait for our order, our movie about to start in 20 minutes .. they lost our ticket ? Fuming at this point, I let my mister talk to the manager. He gave us a half hearted apology and gift cards to the restaurant. The bartender avoided coming by and to appease us they brought out our salad. A salad, after a 40 minute wait ? No thank you.. my mister told the manager to cancel our order and we were leaving. Luckily, Olino has a great menu and we hurried over to make our movie and grab a bite to eat.  It makes me sad to write this review as I've never had such a horrible experience at CPK and love their food. I tried to be optimistic that their service would improve but I'm going to have to call a spade a spade.

The food comes out.  My son's chicken piccata kids is nothing but something with a watery soup like sauce on grilled chicken.  I explained to the server this isn't piccata style.  The waitress came back and said the cook said if we want piccata style kids, we have to order the adult plate.  I nicely explained we've been frequenting CPK for years and it's NEVER been an issue.  She came back and said ok, they're going to make it.

My husband and I are big tippers if we have good service and I made a joke with him that we may need to stop coming to eat here because we are going to be broke from the tips! I am terrible with names and unfortunately cannot remember the names of our servers, but our most recent waitress was wonderful and didn't make a mistake on our order, even though we ALL requested substitutions and changed what we would like multiple times mid order! If she was annoyed with us at all, she hid it well and received a hefty tip from us. I would also like to add, that on our most recent visit to CPK, the manager (I believe) addressed us 3-4 times asking if we were satisfied and if there was anything we needed. It's always great to see management out on the floor, showing that they care about their customers. My husband's appetizer was dropped on the way to our table and they didn't charge us for it and even gave him extra on his plate when it finally made it to the table.  FOOD: The first time we ate at CPK, we ordered the food the way it comes. They are not skimpy on the toppings and the food was good. On our second trip, we made some substitutions and the food was even better!! Since they are not skimpy with the toppings and the toppings are large, I would suggest that if there is anything you don't really care for, substitute it for something that you do like! It made all the difference! Also, I ordered the wheat whole grain crust and it exceeded my expectations! I will forever order it in place of the hand-tossed crust.

61,Luis F.,"Henderson, NV",2,36,132.0,1.0,2017-04-10,"We were excited to come to eat at a CPK and in Hawaii. But we've come to realize that unfortunately they don't hold the same standards as other CPK's.  Wait to be seated was normal, waiter for about 15-20 min to be seated. Once seated, the waitress told us that a high chair couldn't be placed here and we needed to be moved.  Right when we were being moved the greeter told us that the waitress had a problem, not the restaurant and apologized for moving us on her behalf.   Now, I'm not sure why we're moved at this time, after what he told us, but I felt offended.  So, now we're moved to another section and another waitress which couldn't find us for ten minutes.  Finally, after she found us, we hurried to put our drink and food order before she was lost as sea again. Ten minutes later, one of the managers brought my Caesars Salad , pretty nice and pretty good .   Over an hour later, the manager apologizing twice  (about waiting and being patient for our order)within this time frame and still no food.    It makes you think about what happens with other guest waiting this long, savages! While we're waiting, our drinks are done, no refills and again our disappearing waitress is on with her act.  Getting anxious because my family is thirsty and getting more hungry - while my toddler is going full Hulk now, our waitress arrived and asks if we needed a refilled. We had her working on those refills for about another ten minutes, until we got our food delivered. About, that last time we had that same manager come by and apologized for the tardiness of our order, I had to ask him if there was a Fire  Code or an ordnance that would of made that waitress tells us that this area needed to be clear for an emergency then move us because our high chair was placed there.  Surprisingly, he said nothing to what she said, he said no code or no ordnance that would of prevented us to have a high chair there- then he threw out that maybe she wanted to make sure there wasn't a blockage in the walkway but he knew she was wrong and like a good manager wanted, he said that last line to cover up his screw up.  But I had to say that the meet and greet guy told us that she only had the problem and that we were allowed to sit there with a high chair - it was just her.  I told that manager, he threw her under the bus .  Well our food was not the best and after our experience it was making us feel more sick.  A lot of other customers waited for their food while some food sat on the pick up line for twenty minutes or more and no waitress to deliver the food.  Full check, nothing taken off, after all.

80,Vicky P.,"Honolulu, HI",16,17,95.0,3.0,2017-04-10,"Finally got a chance to go to this new location in the Ka Makana Alii Shopping Center. While waiting for your table, there is complimentary water infused with fruit flavoring which is really refreshing...especially on a hot afternoon.  The decor and dining areas are well designed for comfort and style.  The menu is the same as the other CPK's...so it's basically a different vibe when compared to the other CPK's that I've been to on Oahu.   I had the Zucchini pasta with Shrimp and I think it's my new fave.  The kids had Mac and cheese (again!) and it was a good portion.  I think the best bang for your buck would have to be the pizza because it's made nice a toasty in the oven for a very reasonable price.  I would say the price for the pasta is a little much considering the serving size you get...the plate is huge and the pasta is small in comparison.  Eat with your eyes!  So...if you're like me and you drink a lot of Strawberry Lemonade because you're thirsty after waiting in the afternoon sun, you shouldn't have a problem.  But...if you're hungry, you best get an appetizer help fill you up.  (Artichoke dip with yellow and blue tortilla chips would be a yummy choice.) We went with some friends and had a total of 8 in our party.  Service wasn't the greatest as we had a difficult time finding our waitress.  However, other servers stepped up to help when we asked them to refill drinks, etc.  So...maybe we just got the wrong server that evening.

We got lucky and found a spot within 5 minutes behind CPK. We were told wait would be at least 45 minutes so walked around. Once we finally got seated we ordered an appetizer (crispy ahi tuna egg rolls that was the special they were pushing), a Chimay (beer), Sangria flight, and our food. After 7 minutes the waitress came back to tell us they were out of Chimay so my husband ordered a different beer. My sangria flight came out and all were delicious. About 10 minutes later the manager comes out and tell us they are out of crispy ahi tuna egg rolls and the prep guy is making more but it would take ""a long time,"" and do we want to wait on them. She also asked if we wanted a different appetizer which we declined since it wouldn't be there before our food. 10 minutes later our food came. One pizza crust was black from being over-cooked and the other had very little of the sauce that was supposed to be on it. When our check came it had the appetizer on the bill that we did not receive. The waitress took it off, but should have checked prior to giving us our bill. Being out of beer and your advertised special on a Saturday night is the wrong way to get and keep business, as is an incorrect bill. Waitstaff should check which items are out of stock when they come on shift to avoid telling customers they have items that they don't.

The second time the pasta was much better but to be honest I thought the other CPKs I've visited made the kung pao pasta better.  I loved the spinach and artichoke pizza. Creamy and flavorful and you get nice texture difference with pizza crust. Also you can't go wrong with free bread and olive oil while you hungrily wait for your order. Balsamic vinegar also adds a nice acidic touch which can request.  The beehive sangria was great not to mention pretty too.

Appetizer came out in 5min, crazy fast, but our sangria's never came... 20 min later I ask a random waitress to check on our drinks because one its been awhile and two our waitress is Mia. Once our waitress cones with our drinks we order dinner, 2 pizzas, a salad, and their new power bowl thing. Pizzas came out within half an hour, power bowl came in about an hour into ordering, our two friends who ordered the pizza were done with their dinner by the time our other friend received her bowl. My salad was still being made.... Thai salad with avocado. Idk maybe growing the avocados in the back?! But after an hour and half, and no waitress in site to give a heads up, I stand up and walk to the counter to let them know I dont want my salad anymore.

182,Tom C.,"Ewa Beach, HI",75,40,14.0,2.0,2017-05-02,"So...been here alot since they opened but for some strange reason, I always have some sort of problem...like ordering a chicken salad and not getting any chicken in it (after I brought it to their attention they brought some on a plate), or ordering some soup and it being just lukewarm...anyways, tonite we get this waitress who was pleasant enough but who asked if we wanted dessert even though we were in the middle of dinner and then brought us the check before we were finished eating! Then, to pay our $45.82 bill, I gave her 2 gift cards. One I didn't know how much was on it (which later we found out had $50 on it and a card that had $13.31 left on it. We get the folder back with a card with a $4.18 balance on it which was the $50 card. So we wonder where the other card went with the $13.31 on it. We ask to see our server and she comes back with the missing card with a receipt that said it had no balance on it. We check the back of the card number to make sure it matches the receipt that she gave with the supposed empty card and it was. We point out that the number that was rung up was off a digit on the receipt but she  insisted that it was right and that she could check it again if we wish. We decided to check for ourselves, got on our phone's computer and sure enough, the card still had a balance of $13.31. Waited for her to return but she never came back. So though it may have been an honest mistake, I took a few bucks out of the cash 20 % tip that I had already put in the folder just because she argued and didn't really seemed concerned. I think this place needs to train their staff a little bit better on customer service. She should have brought back the card that she said had no balance on it and because she seemed to be rushing, is probably why she didn't input the right number because I would hate to think she was trying to keep that card in question with the $13.31 balance on it.

Another couple who was waiting outside, prior to us, came in to ask if a table was ready. Only then were they told a table was ready. We received a text that our table was ready after sitting at our table 25 minutes later! Service was very slow at this site; even though there was quite a few empty tables. Though our drinks and order was taken right away, we didn't get our food until approximately 45 minutes later. We ordered salad as our appetizer and the order wasn't made.

68,Lina S.,"Ewa Beach, HI",33,99,199.0,4.0,2017-05-18,"Im so glad that the west side of the island has a CPK location. I disliked the drive into Aiea, just to have an hour long wait outside. Maybe that's my bias against going to Pearlridge in general talking, but man I'm glad I get to dodge that 20-30 minute drive now!  This CPK is at the Ka Makana Ali'i mall at the far end near the Olino Theatre. There's ample parking in front and behind the restaurant. The only thing is that the mall can get pretty congested, so you still may have to walk a ways to get to your destination. At least the parking lot makes sense, though. This CPK is fairly new and looks as such. It's very clean and well kept. The inside is dimly lit in the evenings, and there's tons of seating. Despite that, sometimes the wait times can reach an hour or more around dinner because of the location.  I've become so smitten with their baked potato soup, it has made a regular customer out of me. A bowl of that and two rounds of their house bread will do me in every time. But I can never leave it at that - I HAAAAAVE to have their butter cake. Y'all don't understand how seductive it looks on that menu page. 100% recommend every day.  The only drawback about this location is that you can really feel when their team is understaffed. The last time my boyfriend and I dined here, we waited over an hour for house bread, soup, and appetizers. Very upsetting, but we saw our server hustling so hard to tend to almost half the restaurant. I have mad respect for a team that can pull that off, but come on management! Can we hire more people that can rotate out with those who work their butts off, or at least hire enough to account for those who just call out?

279,Sav G.,"Honolulu, HI",1,15,17.0,3.0,2017-06-02,"Second time eating at this CPK location for dinner and let me tell you, I initially would have rated this establishment a 5 based on my first visit, however, I am unable to do so following this evenings experience (6/1).  The main factor for my previously pending five star review was due in large part to the dishes we've ordered tasting better than our known and loved expectations we've consumed many a times. Everything we've ordered has tasted great.  Now moving on to this evenings experience, please see the following pros and cons:  *THE GOOD* - Whom I believe to be the  Manager on duty tonight, Kawika (please forgive me if the name or title is incorrect) was the perfect model of exemplary customer service.  - Atmosphere and decor. This location contains the best design I've seen in a CPK establishment on Oahu. Brings a nice modern vibe and setting to the West Side. - Both times we've dined here the wait was little to none. Keep in mind though, each time was from 8-9 pm.  - The food! I have to reiterate that the standard, always good CPK dishes were noticeably elevated in comparison to all previous dining experiences at other beloved CPK locations. The individuals preparing everyone's food in plain sight (open kitchen) were quite poised and professional.  -- end section --  **THE BAD: ** - Non-cohesive FOH staff. - FOH  inability to gage customer demeanor and tailor standards of serving to best suit the individual/group. - FOH inability to give a shit. - Have had the same Hostess during both encounters and all I can say in the most polite way is that I will not comment further on this matter. - FOH complete lack of understanding in regards to what their jobs entail. . . e.g. CUSTOMER SERVICE, SERVICE INDUSTRY, TEAM PLAYER, etc. I'm currently still trying to fathom what several of the FOH employees from this evenings shift were thinking, and that's under the assumption they were thinking at all. - The Bartender's working tonight's shift definitely brought the bitters. . lol, pun intended. As a former bartender, I understand  the struggle; and that's the last decent thing I have to say about those two heathens. Without a doubt I know how it is to be annoyed when customers enter the establishment  right when you were almost finished closing up bar , trust me I know! With that being said, my best advice to you is to seek other jobs/career paths because although I understand your desire to close up early and get out of work - I DON'T CARE. Suck it up and be professional or move on! I have never been so offended by the actions of a bartender(s), ever!  This is me attempting to keep this review cordial since you two bartenders exhibited behavior indicating such a heightened sense of  self entitlement, it's pitiful. I would suggest not telling your fellow coworkers inaccurate information and doing so in an advantageous manner so that YOU may not be required to give a flying .... about anyone other than yourself and / or money. Albeit it's highly doubtful ya'll two could make good money at the Korean bars since both of you are less than short of desirable on a personal level.  If it were up to me I would be rid of you both. You two clearly do not have the knack for the service industry and the fact that you are not team players, evidenced by throwing your co-workers under the bus which is abhorrent in an industry which thrives on cohesiveness, these are my comments to you.  This spiel was the exceptionally nice version and as a reminder I have the following comments: 1) Humble yourselves, neither of you are a 10 but you sure act like you's a 20, but your attitude and appearance average out to really be  -64, just saying.... 2) Seek further training - I suggest Mrs. Moats of the day shift. This will assist you in understanding the importance of building rapport, 3) Seek non-customer service related job.  -- end section -- All in all, I would highly praise this establishment if it weren't for ""the bad"" aspects listed above.  However, I will continue to frequent this restaurant due to the attentiveness of the manager working tonight, pleasantry of indirect FOH staff, and overall hopes that the other FOH staff get it to-effin-gether.

Open all afternoon, less teeny than the other restaurants (Luibeno, the healthy Cove, Koa restaurant) near the Food Court area, and more of a true sit-down place, cool and oasis-like with its high ceilings and slightly darkened interior. Good service: Lots of water refills, bread basket refills, and we even got an offer to have our endless iced teas turned into take-out drinks.  Bravo on the training of new staff. We tried: Shishito pepper appetizer:  Husband's mom found this interesting, in its slight bite of bitter-spicy, its brown sauce obviously some kind of olive or grapeseed oil with ground garlic, its texture and soft toothfeel.  MIL thought this a little salty, but I thought it was ok. BBQ chix sando set:  hubs got the smashed pea and barley soup accompaniment, but should have gotten the caesar salad one. Now that they put ALL the caloric info on the menu, you can see what's naughty and problematic, and what's not. :) Arugula and asparagus with shaved parm (? not sure the cheese variety) starter:  VERY fresh peppery greens.  Dressing is neither too oily nor too salty.  Refreshing and delightful. Banh mi quinoa bowl: MIL got this, including the grilled chicken, and LOVED it.  She complains about everything and has an excellent palate, and is trying to eat super healthy.  She liked the pickled veggies despite their unfamiliar sourness.  She's never had real banh mi nor Viet sandwiches, and tends to be hostile to new foods/tastes, so this was a true WIN. Two in a bowl soup:  smashed split pea/barley and summer soup (squash with other veggies?).  This is always just okay, and I don't know why I keep ordering it whenever I go to a CPK.  I think there's a lot of cream which makes it a comfort food.  The new summer soup is kinda blah, but that's how I feel about everything soup-y in this joint.  Still, hit the spot, along with the endless iced teas, bread refills, cool restaurant, etc. Did I say their bread is very sourdough-y and crisp-chewy in the right ways?  Refilled at least once.  NIIIICE, as Borat says.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kapolei?start=180,2.6,2.84,3.008,3.2800000000000002,2.744

I'm honestly so done with coming here.  1st time) Ordered lettuce wraps and a side Caesar salad. Lettuce wraps came out, and about 30 minutes after that we had to flag our waitress down to ask where our salads were (which, you'd think, would come out first). She apologized saying they forgot to make it and would start on it right away. Mind you, this was during a weekday right at opening and the restaurant was not busy whatsoever.  2nd time) Someone in our party had ordered a salad (we were a party of 9) and while everyone else's food was brought out the salad never showed. Again, we had to flag down the waiter and ask about how long the salad would take.  3rd time) there were 3 of us in the party who ordered salads. One of us got it as a meal and the other two were side salads. As all the food was coming out, low and behold what never made it to the table (AGAIN!). We had to flag down the waitress yet again to ask where the salads were. The response? ""We ran out of lettuce and someone else is out buying more right now so it'll be awhile"". What in the actual heck???? 4th time) we went right at opening and when we were ready to order someone in our party wanted to order avocado club egg rolls. The waitress told us that ""it's not available because it's not prepped"". Ok, fine whatever. So we just order our food and I order lettuce wraps and a small plate of Mac n cheese bites. As all the food starts to come out I get my lettuce wraps but the the Mac n cheese never makes it to the table. About 10 minutes into eating my lettuce wraps the waitress comes over to tell me that it's taking awhile because they're prepping the cheese bites. So I say ok that that's fine. Another 10 minutes passes by and she comes by again and says they're frying the bites and it should be ready shortly. ANOTHER 10 minutes go by and she comes back and says ""sorry, we ran out of the Mac n cheese bites, but you can order the avocado egg rolls because those are ready now"". WHAT. THE. F??? I just said forget it.  ANOTHER issue we had with our food this day is a kids cheese pizza. It was so ROCK HARD our poor guest couldn't even eat it! We suspect it was ready before all our meals were and was just placed under the warmer too long to be brought out to our table at the same time as all the adults food. Which should NOT have happened. I don't know why they wouldn't have just brought out the child's food first. We complained to the waitress and she said she would tell a manager to come over and have them talk to us, but alas, no one ever came and she brought the bill with the rock hard pizza still being charged to us.

The restaurant itself is spacious and beautifully decorated; it still has that new feeling. I honestly believe it's gonna be in a hot spot with all the new shopping places still coming up!  Our waiter was very kind, no complaints there.  In terms of food, I ordered a shrimp scampi zucchini (one of their popular items). While it was really tasty, the price of 16.99 for the small portion I got was not worth it. For that price I wish there was more food and more flavors. My mother ordered their lemongrass chicken (available for a limited time), and it tasted delicious. The chicken was doused in teriyaki sauce on a bed of brown rice, mushroom and lemongrass.

And I appreciate that they are open later than the other restaurants in the area on a Friday night. Everything closes about 9/10 while this place is open until 11 pm. I really liked the chicken dumplings! The flavors all came together nicely. The California veggie pizza was good. I liked that they packed on the veggies. And the buffalo cauliflower was spicy and tasty. My husband said ""its cauliflower"". Yes it's not buffalo chicken wings but buffalo cauliflower. But he did enjoy it so it's a good choice. I'm trying to tell you about all the positives because overall there were many good things about our visit.  Our waiter Tiara and her manger that evening were fantastic! But I must tell you the lead up to explain why they were outstanding. My friends and I consisted of a party of 7. We were quoted an hour wait and we decided we would wait. The hostess asked if we would like the patio or inside and I said the first available. So while waiting outside we noticed that the patio cleared up, but they were lagging on getting the tables prepped. I could see four employees gathering around the host table just chatting away while there were so many tables that we could have been sat at. So after waiting patiently for one hour my friend went in to check how our table was doing. And they had decided to close the patio because the waiter/waitress had been there too long. Ok so I get it's an HR problem. But the fact that they closed the patio wasn't really the problem. The current host just made a really impersonal shrug on the shoulder and an uncaring ""there is nothing I can do."" Come on, don't act like that when a woman is hungry. You'll turn it into hangry! We finally got seated and we're comforted by the fact that Tiara was an outstanding waitress and she knew what she was doing. She knows what it means to be in the service industry. We told her about the host and the manager swept in and took care of it right away. I just hope that the host learns because he's the first one the customer comes into contact with. And the steak my friend ordered was underdone (maybe because they were trying to get our order out quickly) but they made sure to fix it and comped our Dumplings. So because of these outstanding individuals I was able to come from a ""I'll never come back here again"" to a ""I'd come back here again"".  So I hope you can give them a chance too.  And it seems that the employees have a good camaraderie, but maybe you shouldn't take your break in the front at the host table where hungry customers are still waiting to eat.  It makes me wonder that maybe you could have been tidying up the bathroom or the dirty floor. So if they can maybe train their employees to be more professional I could easily give them 4 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kapolei?start=40,3.36,3.05,3.028,2.38,3.174

Place is always clean and staff is always courteous. The drink menu is very broad and extensive. Prices are a little high but your eating at a brand new restaurant in a brand new mall in Hawaii, so I guess that's to be expected.  CONS: Due to lack of sit down eating options in the area, this place can be crowded quick and there isn't enough staff at times to handle the rush.

There's a total of 5 on Oahu (Hawaii Kai and Mililani as well) with 2 more opening in the neighbor islands in the future (Kauai and Maui).  But I can honestly say that CPK Kapolei was a hit in my book! This new venue is located across the new Cheesecake Factory at Ka Makana Ali'i (KMA). Parking can be accessed through the mall parking lot - I prefer parking on the movie theater side as those lots are usually available. Be careful parking in lots that have blue dots as those are for workers at KMA. The GOOD: Compared to other CPK's (except Mililani), this CPK has a nice outdoor area - they use this area for Paint Nite. Be wary of the weather though because it can be quite chilly if the wind is blasting in this area. The drinks are tasty too - the bar is spacious and would recommend the Moscow Mule and Honey Bee Sangria!  The BAD (Not Really): I don't have much negative things to say about this place as the wait wasn't bad at all. Probably the only uncomfortable part was the wait as there was a moment when the food took awhile for our large party of 16. But our waiter was patient and accommodated us well (Shoutout to Tito)!  The BEAUTIFUL: The food was SICKNING! The spicy buffalo cauliflower is a must-get!  If you're wanting to save room for your entree, I would recommend the white corn guacamole + chips or the spinach artichoke dip! Our friend got the Thai crunch salad and I'm sad that I didn't get it - it was that good! The fire-grilled ribeye was good - take note that you can replace the arugula salad with Mac salad. I also got the shrimp scampi zucchini, which tasted perfect (good amount of shrimp) and wasn't heavy because of the zucchini noodles (it's mixed in with regular noodles as well). I avoided the pizzas as I wanted to get dessert too - YOU MUST TRY THE BUTTER CAKE!!! It's a mix of butter, whip cream, cheesecake and vanilla ice cream.  I definitely have a different view of CPK after going to this one. The interior is classy and the workers marched the interior - classy as well.

There was only one bartender servicing the bar and then she ended up having to service the outside patio tables and then tables surrounding the bar. When that happened, service got a little slower towards the end, but it was understandable, she still gave great service! I felt bad because she had to cover all that by herself. The manager did stop by for a quick second to check on her. I'm guessing they were short staffed? We ordered the Bianco flatbread (my fave), the shrimp scampi with zucchini noodles and tried the pumpkin cheesecake for dessert. The bianco was good, as always, the shrimp scampi was alright, it just seemed like it was sitting under a heat lamp for a little bit because the cheese congealed on my plate and it just didn't look fresh off the line. Also, our food came after a couple who sat down about 10 minutes after us and ordered after us. The pumpkin cheesecake was definitely rich, but it was delicious and that caramel sauce is delicious!

But tbh when we came here on a Friday Night, it was actually the best idea evarrr! We were originally suppose to go to cheesecake factory here at ka makana but because they just opened and everyone and their mama wanted to eat there, the hour was a 2-3 hour wait. So my sister in law just put our name down at cpk just incase because they wouldn't even give us a buzzer at cheesecake. We cancelled our reservations a cheesecake because cpk was ready to seat us in no time. the wait wasn't that long (hence the fact that we were coming all the way from kalihi, lol) I wish I remembered what our servers name was, because honestly she was the best server I have ever had in my entire life. When she talked to you, she had made sure she made direct eye contact with you, and that she had her full attention on you, nothing else to distract her. She listened and answered all our questions and also put in her advice on what she liked. She kept all our drinks topped off, kept the bread coming, and made sure our orders came out at a steady pace as well.  Their lettuce wraps and avocado rolls (I think that's what its called) appetizer is the freakinggg bommbbbbb ! I literally want to go back to cpk just to eat that. Lol. I had the club pizza had that was so ono I couldn't even finish it all, back then they used to call it the BLT pizza. But now they just add avocado to it, which isn't all that bad either. But the real winner of the night was the dessert! lol I forget what that was called to. Its that butter cake one I think ? That was yummy too.

252,Jackie O.,"Mililani, HI",19,219,524.0,3.0,2017-12-03,"I'm not a big fan of this location. I've been here about 2-3 times. The most recent time, my boyfriend and I sat at the bar since it was first-come-first serve and this particular night the wait was 1 hour since it was a Saturday night and there was a reserved party for 40 on the patio. We waited about 10-15 mins before getting seats at the bar. The bartender Wika was really nice and informative. I usually order fish tacos but I was in the mood for a pasta. I remember before they had a pasta dish with asparagus. I noticed it wasn't on the menu so when I asked our bartender, he mentioned that they could still make it even though it's not on the menu. However, he wasn't finding it in their computer system and didn't know how to ring it up/in. So when a manager came, she told me that they would have to charge me for all the ingredients which would come out to $21-something. Nevermind! That's quite expensive! I would think as a manager, it shouldn't be an issue to charge me for the most comparable pasta dish on the menu and just tell the kitchen guys what dish to make.  Oh well! I ended up getting my favorite pasta dish there, which I don't usually get because it's probably really unhealthy - the garlic cream fettuccini. I haven't eaten this dish for a long time. I'm not sure if all the locations make it the same way, but I remember it being much better! Like I said, maybe it's just the way this location made it. First of all, it was such a small portion. Usually I could take some to-go. Then I noticed the pasta was a little dry and maybe not boiled long enough because the pasta wasn't very swollen. It was still a bit on the harder side and showed color of the yellow when the pasta is uncooked. And the flavor wasn't on point! My boyfriend got the steak dinner. He said it was just okay. He'd much rather have the steak at Cheesecake Factory.  Also, I asked the other bartender/bar back (?) for a little more complimentary bread, and she responded so quickly to say there was none but that she could bring some out when there is more. I felt like she was just being lazy and didn't want to check or walk to get some. How does CPK not have house bread? I've never been told that before. Later she even acknowledged me when she noticed we were done eating, as if to say she would be bringing our check. You would think, she would remember about the bread and say something about that like, ""I have some bread for you or I still don't have any yet but they'll be ready soon. Do you want to wait or do you want your check already."" Maybe they need a little more training on the hospitality side and the cooks too...my pasta wasn't really worth it.

But my favorite is pasta is Chicken piccata and favorite pizza is the roasted spinach and artichoke.  The servers are always friendly and what I love about CPK is the Pizza dough rewards.  There are offers that often compliment the order we put in and often get added savings.  They also help out non-profits with fundraisers which is an added bonus.  Kapolei location has a different vibe and decor than the other location on Oahu.  I love it because it is sleek and modern decor.  There is one thing that CPK shine and that is their signature dessert.  I actually devour it myself it's the BUTTER CAKE with vanilla ice cream.  The cake is comes to you warm with the generous scoop of vanilla ice cream on top of it.  But what makes it so good also is the sugar crystals you experience in every bite full.  I even come back some times just for dessert.  You can't go wrong with CPK because of the various dishes to choose from.  Enjoy and get that Butter Cake!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kapolei,3.32,3.11,3.056,,3.194
244,Judy C.,"Honolulu, HI",497,483,7849.0,5.0,2017-12-05,"Another California Pizza Kitchen at a new mall, Oh yes please, I am a fan! I just love this California Pizza Kitchen location! Yes., we need more CPK locations and happy that CPK is now on the west side. I have been here many times and it is so convenient for my family. After the movies & shopping, what a treat to end with dinner. This fairly new CPK  opened on 9.30.2016. I remember when I dined during their grand opening, the wait was over an hour, so I went shopping and I received a text that our table was ready, such great service. During my recent visit while staying out at Koolina, We didn't have to wait for a table, it must be that I am lucky or because of Cheesecake Factory. Doesn't matter, I was happy that we didn't have to wait. Every visit, it gets better every time.  I love this CPK location, with great and modern decor, love the full bar with multiple big screen TVs. The restaurant is spacious and great seating, indoor and outdoor.  What is your favorite at CPK?  Although everything is so good and I want to order everything on the menu, my favorites are the Thai crunch salad, with avocado for 3.00 more is a must and I always get the full size, BBQ chicken pizza, and recently I am in love with the Jambalaya!! For some reason, the Jambalaya is so much tastier at this location. This is enough for my family. Oh & I must have the bread with my Thai crunch salad and jambalaya. YUMs!!  & for dessert, I LOVE the butter cake! This is a must order, the butter cake with ice cream. Think pound cake but this butter cake is way better, served warm and taste out of the oven fresh!  During this recent visit, Kasey was our server and she was awesome! She provided excellent service, from taking our orders, filling our drinks and checked on us often. Since I had leftovers, she even gave me extra, fresh bread to bring to the hotel.  Overall, this is the best CPK, (my opinion) I can't wait for my next visit to the west side and for CPK again!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kapolei,3.36,3.12,3.056,,3.2160000000000006
27,Taylor A.,"Honolulu, HI",74,79,63.0,1.0,2017-12-06,"I'm basing this review off of the wait, food, and three times I've been here. Mainly this last time.  I came here for my bday last year and everything was great.  Fast forward to now, one year later, HORRIBLE.  We walk in on a Wednesday afternoon. It's not busy at all. No one was in the front so we waited about 10 minutes til someone showed up to help us. She apologized for the wait which was fine. We got seated at a booth.  No one came to help us for a good 15 minutes. When someone came she showed up with just the bread - not fresh by the way. It was COLD and super stale :) we ordered our food - OH but alas, they changed their menu again. They no longer serve the Chinese chicken salad I've been ordering here for years :( What?? Omg. Okay. We just ordered a pizza and my sons Mac & cheese. And just waters.  We also asked for balsamic vinegar, that never came. So we had to ask another server that came out with my sons Mac & cheese for it and she got it for us right away.  I understand as servers we all have bad days and good days but YO this server has NO customer service skills whatsoever. We weren't given utensils for my sons food, so I asked her for a spoon & she said okay. She never came back. She came back again, 10-12 minutes later asking if I wanted to order anything else........I said no? But can I still get a spoon for my sons food? She didn't even say I'm so sorry, nothing, and just said ""sure!"" Like are you serious right now? she came back with the spoon, placed it in the table and didn't say anything.  At this point. It's been almost an hour and we still haven't gotten our pizza yet! We only ordered ONE pizza. I don't understand why this place has gone completely downhill and I'm sad to rate cpk 1 star because I honestly love cpk - well not so much anymore since they took my fave dish off the menu.  Our server came to drop off the check and didn't bother asking if we wanted dessert, which we did. Every time she came to our table to do something she would leave right away without asking if there was anything else we needed. She came back, another 15 minutes later and I said I wanted to order butter cake. She took the check away and came back with the butter cake when it was ready. I asked for a box for my sons food cuz there was obviously a lot left over, she said okay, and didn't come back, AGAIN, for another 10 minutes, to ask if we still wanted the food boxed??? I just said yes...we asked for s box........she took the plate away to box it. Came back dropped it off and didnt come back with our check. We were 15/20 minutes after finishing our butter cake just sitting there waiting for our check. Idk if she forgot or what but we were literally wasting SO MUCH TIME. She only had two other tables btw it was really not busy at all, again. I told my bf to just go up and pay for it already because we had to go, so he did.  As for water refills we never got one. It was strange when she noticed my bfs water empty at the end of our meal and she took the whole glass and brought back a new one. Usually they just refill waters in front of you, or already have a new one ready to replace it before taking the glass away.  We ordered the bbq chicken pizza btw which is something I order regularly at CPK, it was the most dry pizza I ever had :( it definitely needed more bbq sauce. My son enjoyed his Mac & cheese at least from what I could tell, and butter cake was amazing as always.  I hope to come back maybe to write a better review but not so sure since they keep changing the menu and taking away the good stuff lol.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kapolei?start=40,3.24,3.1,3.052,,3.1560000000000006
6,Mika G.,"Kailua, HI",70,51,143.0,5.0,2017-12-08,"We ate here the other night to celebrate my baby turning 2. Got here at about 6:45 and were promptly seated. Our waitress was ok. Not bad but also not incredibly friendly but we found out later that she had been up since 5:30am, has 5 kids at home and was visibly pregnant with her 6th. She was actually friendlier towards the end of her meal. But I am a mom of 3 young kids so I never fault another mom for working hard to support her family and being tired. She is trying her best I know.  We put in our order fairly quick due to the kid and it came out quick enough for my liking. She also brought us a lot of bread which was helpful.  I am on a pretty strict diet and I really appreciate how accommodating CPK is to patrons like me. I sometime get big eye rolls from servers and kitchen staff but CPK is really liberal when it comes to substitutions or special dietary restrictions. I didn't need to make substitutions though. They have a shrimp scampi zucchini dish that is phenomenal. So good that I was too excited to even take a pic.  But it's shrimp scampi with half fettuccini noodles and half zucchini noodle. And they make the zucchini noodle broader to blend well with the fettuccini. And it tasted like they made their scampi sans butter which helped my special diet even better. I felt like I could comfortably dine out and be in control of my diet. The amount of pasta in my dish made me feel like I got a taste of it without depriving myself of it or feeling guilty for eating it.   Thank you CPK!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kapolei?start=20,3.24,3.1,3.064,,3.1560000000000006
243,Angel D.,"Honolulu, HI",253,335,1376.0,2.0,2017-12-12,"First and foremost, I just gotta say CPK is my absolute favorite place to go but this location was a little disappointing. Don't get me wrong, our server was very friendly and attentive so she isn't the reason why I'm leaving a review. I got their Kung Pao Spaghetti, and it the portion was way different from the other locations. I got a mountain of noodles, and not enough sauce so the noodles were very dry. The server topped it with a little cheese on it and it made it a little better. Lettuce wraps were on point, we got the chicken & it was tasty. My friend attempted to order their Chinese Chicken salad and they no longer serve it. Great. So my friend ended up ordering warm veggies, it was OK. The dressing had a sour taste to it. The grilled shrimp was good though. As for drinks, I got the Beehive Sangria. I usually get it whenever I go but this time it was waaay too sweet. My friend got their wine flights, all was pretty good except for the red sangria. It tasted super watered down. Probably won't be returning anytime soon but maybe one day we'll give it another try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-kapolei,3.2,3.11,3.064,,3.146

We waited half an hour for an empty patio that continued to be empty as we ate there. TELL ME WHY THAT IS... I'm just done with CPK. NEVER AGAIN.

I haven't been to California pizza kitchen since the 90s before I moved to California, now that I'm back home it's great that they have more of them closer to my house on the west side. I went to the newest one at the new mall in Kapolei Ka Makana Ali'i. It was great! I wanted a pizza with a white sauce and the only one they had was a shrimp pizza but I am allergic to shrimp, so they made it with chicken instead and tasted great!

251,Anela A.,"Honolulu, HI",104,139,131.0,1.0,2018-01-04,"SUBPAR FOR THE CPK FRANCHISE Typically when you visit a CPK restaurant, food and service is pretty consistent across the board. I'd say that the one thing that I am always impressed with when things do go wrong, is the service and attention from the restaurant manager. They'll typically come to your table and if anything was lacking, they shower you with apologies and gladly offer to rapid-fire up a new dish. At my most recent visit to this location, both the food and service was substandard. Although the restaurant was pretty empty, our server was very slow to tend to us. I ordered a pinot Grigio, and she brought me a glass of red wine. When I told her that this was not a pinot Grigio, she insisted it was and said that their wines are different. Oohhkayy, I thought. ""Well can you just bring me your version of a white?"" It was a good thing I had my wine because we then waited 45 minutes for a salad, a pizza and Mac and cheese (for my kids). Really? It's not a very complex order. When I expressed concern, the manager seemed a little dismissive. But I was willing to overlook because I was hungry and just wanted to eat. The salad was unfortunately drenched with dressing. I am a religious eater of the Thai Crunch salad and know how it should taste, this was not it. When they offered to replace it I declined in fear I'd be there another 45 minutes. She brought me my bill and while I didn't expect a huge discount, I expected a little bit off for the inconvenience and bad experience. But nothing. I flagged down my waitress to ask her about it and she said she would talk to her manager. For 15 minutes I sat there and watched her go about her business, no urgency. I finally had to stand up and went to a man who looked like he was someone important and he quickly took care of me. Just a bad experience.

I was very impressed with the whole transaction. We actually got there around half an hour after the place opened. We were greeted at the front, and the hostess directed us to the other end of the restaurant where I had no idea that there was a separate entrance to the takeout counter! Duly noted.. we were both kinda hungry so we ordered enough, probably for 5 people! But we were planning on sharing, so we got: -California Cobb Salad w/ side of beets -""the works"" pizza(its every single topping you can imagine) -shrimp scampi zucchini -wild mushroom strozzapreti with chicken(the chicken was an extra, you actually don't need to order any meat with this dish!) Did I mention we were feeling hungry? For dessert, we ordered the Butter Cake, sadly without the vanilla ice cream since we were taking it home, and the Salted Caramel Pudding.  .Gosh...it was freakin awesome! I can agree that their takeout portions are actually a good amount, even when you're sharing and you don't mean to. We got full fast, but that didn't stop us from trying some dessert! But pasta and pizza are always good foods to have for leftovers! Danielle, who helped take out order was very polite, and did an amazing job! She reassured me that their gift card machine was taking a little bit longer to process, but told me that our food would be ready in 10-15 minutes. Instead of just waiting around for it, she asked if I wanted her to call me when it was ready, then that way we could look around the mall. How great is that?!
