They have a great drink menu as well :-) The only complaint that I have is that they don't take reservations. I get it, not for a party of 2 but I had a party of 8 on Sunday! They would not grant my request so I unfortunately had to go somewhere else.  I was highly dissapointed in that. I think that they should accomodate bigger parties but oh well, they're loss, I took business somewhere else~!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-king-of-prussia?start=80,2.54,2.54,2.54,2.54,2.54

77,Melissa L.,"Wayne, PA",1,2,,1.0,2012-08-20,"My boyfriend and I stopped in here yesterday..somehow for the first time. I don't feel like we've been missing out on anything.  The service was quite annoying to both of us. No one greeted us for a while, I suppose our server was very busy or M.I.A so another server came to take our drink orders and ended up keeping our table. Here is where the issue began... she upsold us on some sangrias by saying it was 'Sangria Sunday'. Sounds good. We both got the white sangria per her rec and it was by far the best part of the meal. We thought about getting seconds since it was 'Sangria Sunday' and all. So when I asked what the special was on them, our server literally said ""OH there's no special I just think Sangria Sunday sounds cool""  LOL. Well no more alcohol on our bill then, sorry. I NEVER ever complain in restaurants, but I felt the need to say something when the manager ran our food over. I mean we were tricked! I won't complain about slow or even poor service but deceit is a new one, and very strange. The manager's response was just laughter and telling us they were having a Sangria competition. Okay? Why do I care? He also said they were $3.50 each. When we got our check they were $8 each..as I would have expected. So weird. Anyway, their menus at the current moment are totally out of date..no one let us know. Literally the first 4 things that we tried to order were no longer on the menu. The food we finally got (focaccia bread app and the original bbq chicken pizza..figured they were still making that) was really just OK. Certainly not worth going back!  Maybe I'd go back for the delicious Sangria if there is ever a real Sangria Sunday. Management should probably learn some customer service basics and the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-king-of-prussia?start=60,3.36,3.36,3.36,2.308,3.3600000000000003

35,Greg L.,"Collegeville, PA",71,747,928.0,2.0,2012-11-03,"It pains me to rate CPK only 2-stars, because in general, my family loves the food here. We typically eat at a CPK about once a month and I have to say that service at this location has been steadily declining. We were here most recently to celebrate my son's 7th birthday. CPK is one of my son's favorite places and for the past several years, he picks this place for this birthday dinner with the family. We arrived around 5:30 and there was no wait, so we were quickly seated. Our waiter was over pretty quickly and took our drink order. He came back with our drinks and then took our food order, and from there it pretty much went downhill. I asked for bread when we placed our order. After about 10 minutes of it not coming out, I flagged him down and asked again. This time he did finally bring it out. Throughout the whole night, we had to flag him down to get refills (and he wasn't always easy to flag down) and I went through most of my meal with nothing to drink. He never came and checked on us once during our meal! Close to another 10 minutes passed between when we finished eating and when he came over to ask if we wanted desert. I ordered the kids brownie for my son and told him it was his birthday. He then proceeded to walk away and I was like, whoa, we wanted to order some desert as well. While we ordered the rest of our deserts, I mentioned two other times it was my sons birthday for a total of three times. Like a suspected, his desert came out with no candle and even my son asked me where it was. I was so disappointed. I got ahold of another waitress and asked if they still did birthday candles and she said yes. She got ahold of our waiter and a few minutes later he comes out with a candle and tells my son to close his eyes while I put the candle in the brownie and lit it. Obviously, it was after the fact and didn't have the same impact. We never saw a manager walking around or otherwise I would have flagged them down to complain. While the food was good, the service was horrible. UPDATE ON 11/29/2012: After my very disappointing experience, I wrote an email via their website. You would have thought someone would have at least called me to apologize or something, but after a month, I've heard absolutely nothing from them. I guess they don't just care.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-king-of-prussia?start=40,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.6320000000000006,3.2800000000000002
72,Angel I.,"Seattle, WA",199,325,1362.0,2.0,2012-11-24,"It pains me to write a bad review. I'm only giving 2 stars instead of 1 because the manager Jean came through at the end of the meal. Our server Alex was terrible! I'm not picky but she ruined the entire dining experience. Our order was not complicated at all. Alex had a terrible attitude and was rude throughout our visit to CPK. We asked for beverage refills about 4 times and Alex didn't come through until after we talked with the manager. Alex also could have cared less about her job. Each time we asked for a refill, she would act like it was the first time we asked and that it was such a huge request. She also spilled sauce all over the table and did not do anything. In fact, she placed takeaway food right on top of the sauce.  It was when she placed the takeaway boxes right on top of the sauce that Jean the manager came by. Jean quickly wiped away the sauce. Jean offered to make it up to us with a partial discount/desserts. I hope Alex can take a lesson in customer service and so others don't have such a terrible dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-king-of-prussia?start=60,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.7280000000000006,3.2000000000000006
68,Joe C.,"Haverford, PA",85,111,54.0,3.0,2013-01-01,"This place is the restaurant equivalent of a chick flick. Totally geared toward a female audience who sometimes drag the men in their lives with them. But every once in a while I agree to go because the wife likes it and they have a thoughtful kids menu.  My wife had a salad with something crunchy in it. I had a few bites and it was pretty fresh tasting which surprised me. I got a shrimp scampi fettuccine dish that was only 550 calories according to the menu.  Sports bars don't put the calorie count on the menu. Garlic accounted for at least 200 of those calories. It wasn't horrible but I'm Italian and so...it just wasn't good. It was a notch below Olive Garden and there wasn't much of it. At least the OG has the decency to give you volume if not quality.  Lucky for me we also had a pizza coming. But it was some kind of Thai chicken blah blah. So it wasn't actually pizza but it wasn't that bad. My son had a personal cheese pizza which looked and tasted ok. Better than a ball game pizza but not by much.  If you've read this far, you might be wondering how I got to three stars.  The answer is the menu, the service, the convenience, and wines by the glass. The menu is extensive without being unwieldy. So if you're in the mood for salad or some fancy pants pizza, grab your purse and head to the mall. You can return some things at Nordstrom while you're there.   And the kids menu had a lot of options for picky eaters. I've seen a lot of kids menus and this is top notch. Our server Andrew was attentive and friendly and smiley. And it's not a bad family option at the mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-king-of-prussia?start=60,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.9240000000000004,3.1600000000000006

The pizza varieties are interesting and tasty, as are the salad choices. Its a great place to grab a bit when you are on the go. My fiance and I grabbed some lunch here this past weekend while we were in between places where we were registering for wedding gifts. I hadnt been to CPK in a really long time, so when I looked at the menu, I found some surprises. They definitely had a lot of new offering since the last time I was there, and they had a few gluten free and while wheat choices for those trying to eat healthy or those who have allergies, which is always nice to see. We decided on splitting the habanero carnitas whole wheat pizza and the roasted veggie salad. Both were very tasty. Loved the heat from the habanero sauce, and definitely appreciated that it was on the side instead of all over the pizza so it could be added to taste. The carnitas were very tender and flavorful. Loved the whole wheat crust, just wish it had a bit more crunch to it. The salad was really filling and full of tasty options. Artichoke hearts, sun dried tomatoes, asparagus, eggplant, avocado and peppers call came togehter nicely in a light dressing. Loved it. Good service as well.

SECOND MISTAKE when we were paying I used my 2 gift cards she said that there's no fund in the card which is very odd because I never used them so i ask her to check it again when she went back she said she made a mistake THIRD MISTAKE when she check my 2 Gift card she said only one card is working which is not true because I never used them. I didn't argue anymore since it was a long day and i just wanted to go . FOURTH MISTAKE: When we were on our way to our car I realized she didn't give back the card that I used to pay for the remaining balance.

112,Michael R.,"Fort Washington, PA",0,9,,2.0,2014-02-22,"I placed an online order last night for pickup.  I ordered two California club sandwiches and a Caramelized peach salad (with shrimp) to go.  The sandwiches came with a side (cup of soup or side salad).  I got the cup of pea and barley soup and my mom ordered the side salad...mothers know best.  The cashier was super nice and generous with his offerings of complimentary bread.   Fast forward to home where we're about to eat.  One of the two California club sandwiches looks great, while my California club sandwich had about 1/3 of the contents that it should have.  It was as though they used almost all the ingredients for the other sandwich and swept up the scraps to make mine.  Ordering two of the same sandwich at least provided me the confidence in knowing that they can make a beautiful sandwich, they just cannot make two in a row.  The side salad was plentiful enough, but the ""cup"" of soup provided wasn't even enough liquid to submerge the ""bowl"" of the spoon (that means the rounded part...I googled it).  I wanted to dunk my complimentary bread in the soup, but it would have soaked up the entire contents, so the complimentary bread was nothing more than a pointless gesture to raise this review by one star...well played CPK.  The peach salad had no complaints.  So, if you are happy with two thirds of your order being really good, get takeout at CPK.  Unfortunately, my third was the crappy third and I can't help but feel that there is no way they would have such a poorly constructed sandwich or minuscule amount of soup had I ordered in the restaurant.  I was disappointed and since I was at home when I discovered it, there is no sending it back to the kitchen for correction.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-king-of-prussia?start=80,2.88,2.88,2.88,3.1120000000000005,2.88

It was plenty comfortable, but it was on the way to the bathroom so we had the pleasure of people watching as they entered the toilets, then watch several men zip up on the way out, which leads me to question whether they even washed their hands on exiting. This was also the thoroughfare for the bus boys taking away dirty plates as well as one of the main routes for taking food to other patrons. We could see into the kitchen and the floor did not look like it had been cleaned in a week. We watched our plates sit for an age on the counter and when the food got to us it was almost cold to the touch. Pizza that is luke warm and limp is a sad state of affaires. Also as a general tip, when a patron asks for mushrooms, generally it's for the whole pizza not just one slice.

My boyfriend and I ordered apps (chicken dumplings and guacamole and chips) and both were good, especially the dumplings. We both ordered different pastas as our entrees and weren't too impressed with their flavor. We didn't complain to our waitress, Nina. We just told her the dishes were ok when asked and that we didn't need any to go boxes.  Well unbeknownst to us, Nina told one of her managers, Kanisha, that we weren't very happy with our entrees. Kanisha immediately came over with the sweetest disposition and probed us about what we didn't like about the pastas, what could have been different about the way they were prepared and if we wanted them cooked over or a replacement meal. She was super nice and when we declined another entree, she suggested we try a dessert, which we did and it was delicious! (Tip: get the butter cake with ice cream...yum!!!)

But they have just one master pizza maker, and he had to work through assembling quite a few pizzas in the cue ahead of mine. It's a respectable pizza, not great, but better than many you'll find in perfunctory neighborhood pizzerias. Individual pizza was of a reasonable size. Salad was very generously sized.

Appetizers - Baja chicken tortilla rolls. Quantity and size of the rolls has decreased since last time and doesn't at all reflect the amount of money they are charging you. Doesn't make you feel at all worth it. Guacamole is not exciting at all. Dinner (Main Course) - Two salads, Chinese chicken salad and Thai crunch salad. Chinese chicken salad was already soggy when it arrived , not to mention it took like forever to come. Our server looked too drained out but was courteous.  Thai salad was alright. Quantities have definitely decreased and not as tasty.  When we were finished with our salad, nobody wanted to come and get the plates or at least some water for almost 20 minutes. One glass of water was all I got which annoyed more when I saw our server standing at the bar and flirting/ talking with the bar tender. After much deliberation we asked another server to ask our server for the check. Finally after a long wait we were relieved and he got us the check.  Disappointed.  Overall - Our table was rocking which spilled all the water from our glasses on to the table, server was lazy and busy talking to there bar tender for more than 15 mins. Very slow service.

Lesser said about the outer crust, the better. It's definitely a test to see if you are dentally challenged soul.

I'm not sure why we did not have silverware until after our appetizer was served, but she was quick to notice and remedy the situation.  I'm a long-time fan of the food at CPK. It always makes me happy to see many original favorites on the menu, such as the spinach artichoke dip, ""Two in a Bowl"" soup options, BBQ Chicken salad, and of course, all the awesome pizzas. Lots of fun, new choices, too! We started with the Sesame Ginger Dumplings. I think they went a bit overboard on the sesame seeds, but the sauce is amazing -- perfect flavor with a little kick. For our entree, I got the Thai Chicken Pizza on wheat crust and he got the Thai Crunch Salad. Both were loaded with fresh ingredients, and the pizza was the perfect temperature.

40,Trushit O.,"Langhorne, PA",35,106,80.0,5.0,2017-07-16,"We love this place and have been going there for years. The one thing that sticks out is the consistency in the food preparation. The taste hasn't changed in so long. Food - the fusion concept is great. The Thai crunch salad  for appetizer and Chipotle chicken pizza , no chicken is a veggie paradise Service - the service impeccable. For vegetarians, when you request no meat they substitute avocado for chicken. Ambience - ask for a booth. On the counter stalls, you end up with someone next to you with a 6 inch partition on the same table",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-king-of-prussia,3.72,3.61,3.61,,3.6540000000000004
51,Mona M.,"Miami, FL",5,47,22.0,1.0,2017-09-17,I just ordered a cesear salad and most of the lettuce was brown and black. I ordered when they were closing so I guess I got the worst of the day. How can you sell rotten salad?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-king-of-prussia,3.56,3.58,3.58,,3.5720000000000005

43,Jacqueline H.,"Schwenksville, PA",6,92,190.0,4.0,2017-10-18,"Really cool place. I love the artwork in here. We were the first table on a Sunday to come in. Our server was nice and attentive. My partner and I shared the spinach artichoke dip which is amazing. They give a generous portion of dip - so much so that we ran out of chips before we could finish the dip (which isn't a bad problem to have). The server also brought us over some fresh bread and olive oil. My boyfriend got the shrimp scampi and I had the Sicilian pizza. We both really enjoyed our meals. The pizza was great - lots of high quality Italian meats on there. It was pretty spicy so watch out if you're sensitive to that. I love it spicy! The pizza was thin crust and a ""personal"" sized pizza, which actually looked more like a medium sized pizza to me. I managed to get two meals out of it. Unfortunately, we had no room for dessert. I would stop by here again when I'm in the mood for pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-king-of-prussia,3.52,3.62,3.62,,3.5800000000000005

41,J.R. R.,"Emerson, NJ",0,27,32.0,2.0,2017-12-30,Okay..so we usually like CPK for a decent italian dish.  We ate our lunch here today but the Shrimp Zucchini Fettuccini was really SOUR.   My wife had to return the plate after one bite. The Ceasar salad with chicken lacked the salad dressing.   Big disappointment.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-king-of-prussia,3.4,3.62,3.62,,3.5320000000000005
