252,Manuel B.,"San Diego, CA",1,49,4.0,2.0,2012-01-09,Service was good.  Food Was not.   I got fish tacos.  They where dry and bland. My brother got the Thai chicken pizza.  He ate less than half and threw the rest away.  My brother is kind of a cheap skate so if threw it away he must of really been disappointed with it.  My wife got macaroni and cheese in which was also bland.  Were not picky eaters but I probably will not go back. I was disappointing because we used to go to the one in Palm springs and Palm Desert and it was always really good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-la-jolla?start=260,3.2,3.16,3.16,2.6640000000000006,3.1760000000000006
339,Saya G.,"San Diego, CA",40,79,,5.0,2012-01-18,"I have to agree with a previous poster that the only reason CPK does not get a higher rating is because its a chain.  Its a great restaurant for a healthy, quick, fairly inexpensive, tasty meal.  And I have always GREAT service.  Everything is always fresh too. I usually order the bbq chicken salad and the lettuce is always fresh.  I've been to other chain restaurants and ordered salads and they hide the yucky brown leaves underneath! Not at CPK. And youcan pretty much customize any dish, like PF Changs.  Also, another thing I learned at CPK today. No heat lamps! We ordered the chicken tequila fettuccine for a friend who was running late.  She had not arrived yet so we asked the server to put it under the heat lamp.  The server said that they do not have heat lamps but she would be happy to make ANOTHER pasta dish!  I have never heard this before.  Also, the UTC location is always busy at lunch but the service is always great and they are always checking in on you.

It had been a few years since my last visit (food poisoning from a different location) but we had a gift card that needed to be used so we stopped by. The pizza is still as good as I remember it, and their jambalaya was tasty...but both were overpriced for what they were.

187,Frances L.,"South San Francisco, CA",2,33,1.0,2.0,2012-02-26,"I've been a long-time customer of CPK. I had my prom dinner here when I was a teen, it's been a great place for hangouts, family dinners, and even birthday parties. But lately, CPK has been disappointing my family with their to-go service, which we are usually a huge customer of. My mother experienced a ""wrong order"" incident at the Fashion Valley location aka they gave her pastas instead of the pizzas she asked for. My mother wanted a tomato basil pizza and was told later that ""No, we don't have tomato basil pizza so I assumed you meant the pasta. BUT, we do have a margherita pizza."" The server even went as far as to blame my mother for not specifically saying ""margherita pizza."" So, instead of clarifying the order like this server should have, she assumed what my mother wanted instead? And then telling her that they had a margherita pizza and not the tomato basil, which, by the way, has practically the exact same ingredients? My mom was appalled.  So my mother, deciding to give CPK another go (bless her heart), went to their location on Nobel Drive instead, thinking that she would avoid the same trouble she had at their Fashion Valley location. Unfortunately, another ""wrong order"" incident happened again at the to-go station. My mother repeatedly said ""no sausage"" on one of the pizza orders and when she went home, she was incredibly disappointed to discover that there were sausages on the pizza. She said to me, ""I just don't understand. After repeatedly telling them exactly what I wanted, how could this have happened?!"" It's been incredibly disappointing and sadly, my mother no longer wants to come to this establishment due to their repeated inability to get the right order. I don't necessarily blame the individual who took the order, but I have an issue with management. They need to provide proper training about doing a ""read back"" on their orders to confirm that they're putting in the right orders for their customer. It is a simple check that can avoid customer service disasters. It's a common thing they do in hospitals (and at other establishments) that help to avoid critical medical errors. If you simply ""assume"" what a doctor's order meant without clarifying or didn't look over something twice because you simply decided it was just too much effort, you could do irreparable damage. Doing a read-back is a simple fix. If management reads this, please bring this up at your next meeting or institute this simple training when teaching your servers valuable customer service. My mother, a restaurant owner herself, understands mistakes that servers make and she is absolutely forgiving. But the sheer lack of respect for customer service has left her and the rest of our family, reeling.  That being said, if that doesn't change up, I would not use their to-go service. And if you do, clarify the order yourself. Otherwise, you just might end up with pasta instead of the pizza you asked for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-la-jolla?start=240,3.12,3.14,3.14,2.8880000000000003,3.1320000000000006

Spicy yum with roasted corn & black bean salsa for the sweetness, cilantro and lime cream sauce - PESTO CREAM PENNE - I tried this more than twice, it was always dry with not enough Pesto Cream. So this always becomes the LOSER among all other food on the table -GARLIC CREAM FETTUCCINE - If you are between this and the pesto cream penne, this is a Winner.

Dew!  To finish the meal off I almost always order the chocolate souffle desert which I like to call a little slice of heaven.   During the meal every server I have ever had there makes multiple stops by my table to check on things.  I never have to ask for refills.  The last time I was in the manager even stopped by my table to ask how everything was, that almost never happens in other restaurants!  Not to mention the staff are very friendly and will talk with you casually as well.

116,Gary R.,"San Diego, CA",810,680,1770.0,3.0,2012-05-21,"Three of us popped in for dinner on Sunday night around 7pm. To be honest, I had never been to a CPK before, and, until I entered its doors, I had absolutely no idea that it was an actual restaurant.  The restaurant was quite busy at our arrival. We waited approximately 10 minutes for a table. The interior is inviting and comfortable, and the staff have a hospitable customer service orientation that was nice to see, especially given that CPK is a chain. We all decided to begin with the full-sized Caramelized Peach Salad w/ Applewood Bacon (~$11). Composed of spinach, field greens, cranberries, warm peaches, red onions and Gorgonzola, I thought that it was extremely flavorful and made for an ideal starter. One of my dining companions commented that the peaches didn't taste caramelized, but, rather, they tasted as if they were dumped right out of a can. I was unable to detect any canny-like flavors, but I was slightly disappointed that there wasn't more of a caramel taste to the peaches.  I departed from the rest of the pack and decided to have a sandwich from the menu, in lieu of pizza. The California Club ($11.50) seemed to be bellowing out my name and I couldn't resist. What a surprisingly tasty sandwich! Served on herb onion bread, the sandwich consisted of turkey, Applewood bacon, avocado, lettuce and tomato. Executed really well. Impressive sandwich that I would certainly order again. Pizzas made an appearance for the other two hungry tummies at the table: The Works (Italian sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, mozzarella, onions, green peppers and olives), and the Jamaican Jerk ( Jerk chicken, spicy/sweet Caribbean sauce,  bacon, bell peppers and scallions). Each pizza is approximately 10"" in size, providing about 6 small slices. I don't believe there were any leftovers. Each pizza averaged around $13 each. A little expensive, in my opinion, especially given the size.   I did find it unusual that CPK didn't have nutritional data on their menu like other chains typically provide. It's probably a good thing, though. While my two tablemates were engaged in conversation, I Googled the caloric value of The Works and found that each smal slice was 238 calories (1,428 calories for the entire pizza). My dining companion would have died had he known he consumed upwards of 2,000 calories last night (pizza, salad and cocktail combined). Poor baby. So, if you're watching your diet, having pizza at CPK is likely not going to help you in that department.  Our service lagged a bit. I noticed that another couple at a table were struggling to be noticed by the waitress on several occasions. Notwithstanding, our waitress was sweet and patient with us while we decided on what to order. Overall, a little overpriced, but still decent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-la-jolla?start=80,3.2,3.16,3.16,2.8920000000000003,3.1760000000000006

268,Dean D.,"Glendale, AZ",118,100,,3.0,2012-06-07,"Being the foodie fanatic that I am, it's so easy for me to write off American chain restaurants as the scum of culinary culture or as a sacrilege that insults culinary history. In some ways, it does. But in other ways, it also represents the course of history that cuisine in general has taken. After all, in a nation that continually grows more and more industrialized with cities that must house hundreds of thousands of people, these chains become a necessary evil that ensures that everyone can be fed. If everybody in America lived strictly on locally grown ingredients, we'd run out of money and then run out of options for eating. It's a terrible and most inconvenient truth but it's one we must accept for now... Where am I going with this? Ah yes, I was kind of scoffing at the notion of a chain restaurant. But I feel that CPK is a chain that warrants legitimate analysis and investigation. So here's my take on the matter. CPK's menu is actually rather diverse and offers a great variety of different specialty pizzas to try. Their pizzas are very colorful and come served on a rather thin crust and topped with many different combinations of ingredients, some of which work wonderfully well whilst others work wickedly wrong. But I guess what I'm trying to say is that they experience and try things, often offering new limited-time items on their menu every year. And the pizzas themselves can be quite pretty. Simple yet elegant and delicate. Consistently light thin crusts serving as a canvas for a rainbow of toppings. Very ""Nouvellian"" in design, perhaps? And the key word here is ""California."" In no way is CPK's pizza representative of classic Italian cuisine. Instead, it embraces California cuisine very well, which emphasizes fusion, experimentation, and the use of locally grown fresh ingredients (well in this case, that last part doesn't apply). But for the most part, their menu reflects that sort of ""mission statement"" rather well. So here we go. Onto the food. My favorite pizzas here are the bbq chicken and the shrimp scampi. The shrimp scampi pizza in particular has bold garlic flavor, which I always appreciate. And the bbq chicken is a classic favorite of mine that CPK does rather well. It's got a good layer of sauce underlying the cheese that complements the thin pizza dough but there's also a crunch quality in the red onions that top it that gives it that little extra yum factor. Once upon a time, they had a buffalo wings pizza on their menu that was bold enough to have chicken wings, wing sauce, and lettuce on it. But whoever thought lettuce on a pizza was a good idea was a madman. Lettuce has no place on a pizza for it adds nothing but an awkward crisp texture with zero flavor on a pizza slice that should be savory and sweet. But the fact that they tried something so outrageous is what makes CPK stand out from the rest of the generic pizza chains out there. Forgive the rather lengthy review. I tire of writing so I'll wrap this up quickly. CPK has consistent good food albeit somewhat pricy. But it's there for you should you ever crave it. And CPK sometimes does unexpected things that no other pizza chain would dare and it deserves high praise at least for that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-la-jolla?start=180,3.2,3.14,3.14,2.8600000000000003,3.1640000000000006

So here's a review of their food past and present: Linguini with clams in a tomato basil sauce - This was my favorite dish, but they no longer serve it. It's light and savory and I'm a fan of clams too so that works out. Luckily, I had tried to mimic their dish at home and was pretty successful.  Jambalaya Fettuccine - It's good when it comes out, but after eating it for about 15 minutes, the fettuccine got cold and it got quite spicy. A bit too spicy for my taste and I probably won't be ordering it the next time. However, if you're a fan of spicy shrimp, this is the dish for you. Their dish has tons of shrimp.  California Cobb Salad - This is an awesome salad. Bacon, avocado, salad, chicken, boiled chopped eggs, tomatoes, cheese, and beets if you request it. I'm not a fan of salad, but all the other components of the salad made it really delicious to eat.  The Meat Cravers Pizza - NOM NOM NOM. If you're hungry for meat and pizza, get this one. Their Sicilian pizza is also good.  Bread and butter - they changed the bread they serve with their butter. I'm not sure, but I think it was a baguette that was originally sliced up so the bread was a harder texture. Now, their bread is pretty much sliced up sandwich bread so it's softer. They also don't give it to you if you don't request it so be aware.  Service - Their waiters and waitresses are very nice and I don't think I've ever gotten a rude one.  Their prices are fairly reasonable, so overall, I'll be coming back for more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-la-jolla?start=120,3.48,3.2,3.2,2.576,3.3120000000000007

221,Roslyn B.,"San Diego, CA",0,15,,1.0,2013-02-06,"Words cannot describe how utterly horrific it is to make a togo order from this place. They have some train wreck of a call center in Colorado that takes your order, then sends it to your specific location. That is, if you can understand to which location they are referring and if your order will ever make it to the one that you ""called"". The operators call Solana Beach by the name of the shopping center (did anyone know that center even had a name??) and pronounce La Jolla ""luh jawla"". And that's honestly just irritating; the truly bad part is that they ALWAYS MESS UP YOUR ORDER: I ask to substitute shrimp, I end up with chicken still tossed into my salad and a side of hot shrimp. I ask for bread, nope, no bread. When every single person insists dressing comes one the side, the one time I finally stop requesting dressing on the side, my salad comes drenched. The other part of the call center that drives me insane is how many times the call has cut out in the middle of ordering. You then have to call back, hope you remember the person's name, and try to confirm that your order made it to the restaurant and wasn't lost somewhere over the rockies. Then, to top it all off, they try to upsell you some ""delicious slice of key lime pie"" or an ""iced cold beverage' its like no, thanks, if I wanted that I'd order it, please just listen to what I DO want and maybe you'll get it right for once. Either every single person in that call center has had a lobotomy or is enjoying Colorado's newly passed marijuana laws a little too much because I have yet to come across one who is competent. Bottom line: wish I could count how many times I've just gone home to eat frozen deli-mex taquitos from 1998 over having to deal with CPK's togo issues.

I soon felt nauseated by the whole situation & only drank 1/2 that stupid dirty glass of wine.  Then, proceeded to hope for the best & ate my dinner along w/ my family off those probably dirty plates.  I did manage to get the attention of the manager in this issue & he was from what he said completely embarrassed & actually acknowledged that the glasses & carafe were dirty.  He comped one glass of wine.  WTF?  This place is gross, gross, gross.  Don't go there.  Stand up for yourself & your right to clean & friendly service.  I will never return as there are just too many better alternatives & I love good service.  By the way, the 1 star is for the hostess.

Pizza is suppose to considered a cheap, but delicious food option for hungry poor college students so California Pizza Kitchen may be considered expensive to that group. However, comparing to other restaurants targeting the similar demographic groups of young working adults, the pricing is comparable. Not to mention, the thin crust pizza they had was surprisingly good. If they were not going crazy with the fusion toppings, I would almost compare the thin crust to a NY pizza. Although I did enjoy the fusion flavors, a traditional part of me did feel that the pizza did not quite hit the spot, but that is alright because the pizza was still delicious. The chipotle one was very spicy, especially when mixed with the salsa, and would be perfect for those who love spicy food. The turnaround was actually pretty fast considering that they were making pizza. I am use to waiting a while when I order pizza, but they actually came out in about the same time as a regular meal. Overall, the service was good and especially accommodating of us when I asked for more of the olive oil with herbs. They also had butter and balsamic vinegar so extra kudos for that!

Great day for the Moroccan-Spiced Chicken Salad at CPK, with roasted butternut squash, dates, avocado, toasted almonds, red peppers, egg and cranberries, with a champagne vinaigrette. It's refreshing, with interesting spices, just enough to taste but not so spiced that it dominates the salad. 1/2 size is still large.  --The sesame ginger dumplings for $8.39 are light and always fun to share. The soy-ginger chili sauce is nice, a little sweet and gently spiced. I'm glad these aren't deep fried...less fat.  --Trying the thin crust Margherita pizza for $13.29, with tomato, mozzarella, fresh basil, shaved Parmesan, and I added oregano. I should have chosen a more adventurous pizza. This is ok, but the crust isn't as good as a Margherita at an artisan or true Italian ristorante.  --Tricolore salad pizza is no linger on the menu, but the kitchen can still make a similar version.  --Salads are fresher than the ones at Tender Greens in UTC. Next time I'll try the Spicy Chipotle Chicken pizza, as CPK is best at the adventurous pizzas.

Finally CPK has a rewards card that entitles you to one free small plate for your first use. I decided to go with the asparagus and arugula salad, which probably was the best part of my meal.

I'm partial to their chicken tequila fettuccine which is not a lunch special, but so good that I have a hard time resisting.

My husband surprised me by coming to visit me for lunch one day, and we ended up at CPK. I had just had CPK cater a large event a week before, and was interested in trying their food items fresh, instead of after everything had been pawed at by my group, and after it had sat out for a while. The restaurant wasn't packed. There were a fair number of people dining that day, but we were shown to a (slightly grimy) table right away. Our waitress showed up almost immediately, and got our drinks to us quickly. And then, it kind of fell apart. I had asked for a bit more time when she delivered the drinks, as I was still trying to peruse the menu and make a decision. She said it was no problem, but then she disappeared for about ten minutes. When she finally came back, I ordered the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine and my husband ordered the Habanero Carnitas pizza. And then the wait began in earnest. People were milling about the kitchen (we were seated right outside of it), waiting for meals to be plated, garnished, or otherwise made ready to go. There were a lot of people in the serving space, but it seemed like there were only two or three people actually making the food. We ended up waiting over 25 minutes for our meals to be brought out, and our waitress never once stopped by to let us know the progress, or to apologize for the wait. My husband did love his pizza. I mean, he LOVED it. He devoured the entire thing in record time, and kept saying how good the meat was, how perfect the crust was, and how spicy the sauce was. Bollocks for him. My food was meh. It wasn't terrible by any means, but it also didn't blow me away. For that wait - and for the price - I wanted to be knocked on my keister. The pasta was a bit sticky, so it was hard to twirl onto a fork to eat. The chicken was a overcooked, so I didn't eat much of it. And the dish itself was overloaded with bell peppers.  I ate what I could, but there was a fair amount of partially-cooked bell peppers and over-cooked chicken pieces left behind.

At this point I'm not even sure I'm writing a review for California Pizza Kitchen! What is going on? Why am I ordering dumplings? Why the hell is it so dark? Why does it take 45 minutes to get an appetizer of dumplings? I'm guessing the waiter got lost in the darkness. I am starting to sympathize for my server, unless he is Dracula and has no choice. I'm now starting to assume CPK hires vampires. Wtf am I even writing about anymore.

Friend wanted to eat at CPK on weekend for lunch since we were both in the area. There was plenty of parking spaces that later afternoon in this strip mall they share with AMC theater and DSW Shoes.  The nice hostess sat us in the back where there were more booths. It felt a bit muggy in the entire restaurant for some reason. Not sure if it's from the kitchen or perhaps they can increase the a/c to a more comfortable level.  There's complimentary bread that comes with a side of olive oil and vinegar.  Sorry for the yellowish pics but the back had yellow awnings covering the patio and windows. We ordered: SESAME GINGER CHICKEN DUMPLINGS: - don't expect these dumplings to be of ""Convoy street"" quality. BUT, these dumplings weren't bad. The filling was flavorful and well seasoned. We liked the fresh green scallions that topped the dumplings.  CRISPY MAC 'N' CHEESE: - deep fried mac n cheese. Friend ordered this and ate only two before he pushed the plate away. He commented to the waiter that something tasted off about the mac n cheese but waiter said that he personally liked the dish.  THAI CRUNCH salad: - I really liked the use of fresh raw napa cabbage in this salad. It was just perfect. The Thai peanut dressing wasn't too heavy. The strips of chicken were pretty dry and I thought there was a tad too much edamame in the salad. You can also add avo for $2 or so more.  PESTO CREAM PENNE with chicken : - this was a nicely creamy pasta dish but could have used more chunks of chicken. The sun dried tomato was a nice tart contrast to the savory parmasan in this dish. Service was fine. Not sure I'd be back anytime soon but might try out another salad . I noticed on their website that they have lunch specials but we weren't ever given that menu so not sure if that was an option at this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-la-jolla?start=20,3.28,3.09,3.112,2.7,3.166

And although I'm a carb girl, I skipped the pasta and choose the Caesar Salad with chicken.  The full portion was more than enough for two, but I wasn't sharing. This girl was hungry. The chicken was perfectly grilled, a nice crisp to the skin without being dry. A few misses: It took a long time to get our food. Service slowed a bit as the restaurant got busier. We had to flag him down to get refills on our water, drinks, etc. But our group was big and the restaurant had gotten busier. Major plus and what kicked this to a 4-star review: Separate checks.

He was awesome.  Very quick, friendly, and attentive.  You can't ask for more.   They served a warm sour dough bread with olive oil before the pizza.  It had to just come out of the oven.  It was soft with just a slight sour dough taste.  I ordered the mushroom, sausage, pepperoni.  I always order pasta and was in a pizza mood. I'm so glad I did.  It was amazing.  delicious.  The sauce was perfect.  The cheese was light; I couldn't really taste it or see it with all the toppings.  The crust was thin throughout and built up thick on the ends.  It was a great pizza overall. The toppings made it.  The mushrooms were small and sliced extremely thin. The sausage was larger round balls and the pepperoni was larger and sliced extremely thin.  I think it was the perfect combo.  They were all fresh and plenty!   We ordered 1 pizza and it was the perfect size to share.  It was 6 slices that I thought were average slices.   We had a tasteful lunch with great service!

It is a little more than enough for one person but not enough for two hungry people.  I had a really good experience at this location, with a really friendly waitress! She saw that we were starving and eager for the pizza to come out so she brought us out complimentary bread and sauce with it! I am not sure if complimentary bread comes with your dish no matter what, but it was still nice that she was understanding and accommodating! She brought us out a second plate of bread because we scarfed down the first one! Overall, I am not sure why people seem to rate CPK on the lower end. If it is food related, try the chipotle chicken and maybe that will change your opinion of this place!

The soup comes with roasted squash and market vegetables with a touch of cream. For the pizza lovers the BBQ chicken pizza is a must. If you love spicy pizza then you have to try the Thai pizza. If you are coming here with kids you have a great kids menu. I love the new CPK menu that added a lot of new vegetarian items for the vegetarian eaters.  You also have gluten free pizzas. Leave room for deserts as you have some amazing cakes. If you are craving chocolate the Belgian Chocolate souffle cake is a must. Also the red velvet cake was excellent.

Despite having pizza in the name, which implies that that is their specialty, their pizzas have always failed to impress me. Combine that with just finishing up at the movie theater with popcorn and a soda and I was craving something healthier. I chose the Cobb salad with no bacon and subbed the bleu cheese for cheddar. I'm aware that this likely no longer makes it a true Cobb salad but it almost perfectly fit my idea of the perfect salad. I love grilled chicken, tomatoes, and eggs on my salad and the only other ingredient that I would have liked would be black olives, which I probably could have requested but forgot. The salad also is topped with avocado, which was new for me as I only recently discovered that I like avocado. The mushy texture is still a little weird for me on a salad and I could do without it but I understand why some people like it, I guess. The ranch here is a little odd but not as bad as places that serve dressing like Hidden Valley. I'm very particular about my ranch dressing and this one had a strong flavor that I'm thinking has to do with the herbs they use in the housemade dressing.  The kids each ordered their own cheese pizzas, which seemed a bit excessive to me, but they're 11 and 12 year old boys and they easily finished the pizza and downed a kids portion of mac and cheese too. Growing boys, what else can I say! My biggest complaint of the night has nothing to do with the food but with the initial greeting. We were told the wait would be 15 minutes but it ended up being 30 minutes. When there's two hungry boys waiting for food, the extra 15 minute felt like an eternity. Had we known the wait would take that long, we would have moved on to another restaurant. Thankfully, our server ended up being amazing and she helped us to quickly get our food and bring out some bread and olive oil to snack on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-la-jolla?start=20,3.24,3.07,3.088,2.9880000000000004,3.138

19,Ryann N.,"Escondido, CA",0,2,,1.0,2016-11-22,"I don't recommend coming here! There are a few other pizzas places extremely close, and another one opening. Stopped in yesterday, first our appetizer wasnt even hot, seemed to get an old order, the gentleman who brought it to us, literally threw the plate down, it landed right infront of my young daughter, and literally bounced off the spare plate that was sitting in front of her, that was just a small thing. Finally the server comes back about 10 min after eating the appetizer, to take our order, it had been so long I had honestly forgotten we hadn't even ordered lunch yet. Ordered a lunch special with out onions, came with onions, tried to pick them out, due to horror stories of sending food back, they were everywhere, I wasn't even done and the pizza was no longer hot and all over the place, the manager brought the food, and the server did not once in almost 10 min even look at our table, had to grab her attention. She immediately and quite noticeably became rude and irritated because I said that I did not want this and no I do not even want a new one (again horror stories). To the best of my knowledge I wasn't even rude, ive worked in the industry and for all I know she put no onions and the person who made the pizza still put them on. So it's not like I even blamed her, 5 minutes later while finally eating my salad, the manager came with a boxed up new pizza, saying ""he felt bad"" then took not only my salad, but my daughters pasta with out asking if we were done, which we had finally just started, boxed hers up, then came back and acknowledged my friend at least asking her if she finished, then brought us our bill, again with out asking if we were done. Pizza that I would never eat was on there,  but I didn't even dispute, because the way I was treated over simply not wanting something that was NOT what I ordered was ridiculous enough, and I felt due to their behavior already, that the managed and server would cause a scene in front of my child, paid just fine and even regretfully tipped 20%. So if you want pizza I would recommend walking a few feet to the other places near by, because you won't get what you ordered here, even the ""hot"" appetizers were cold, and you will be treated completely horrible over it.

Taking her advice, we ordered two pastas that, in the end, we COULD NOT FINISH-- And my boyfriend and I are pretty big eaters by the way (This is only good for those of you who like huge servings that could feed two people).

167,Jessica D.,"San Diego, CA",6,21,15.0,2.0,2017-06-20,"It's rare for me the leave such a bad review but I am so disappointed in dinner tonight. I have never eaten at a California pizza kitchen, I've only ever had their frozen pizza. I was really excited to go in and try their other food. When you walk in, you're greeted by nice hostesses and the restaurant looks very clean. We got seated at a table for 4 and it took a bit longer than normal for our server to come over and take our drink order. We order drinks and an appetizer. After about 3 minutes a table behind us gets seated and they now have their drinks. We are STILL waiting on our drinks. They FINALLY arrive and we are then waiting again for our app. It comes out probably 15 minutes after we place the order. So now we have finished with our appetizer and our drinks are empty. He still doesn't come over. Another 20 minutes and we finally have our dinner. I had to ask the girl who brought our dinner out to refill our drinks. She doesn't even remove the empty glasses. He comes over AFTER we have been taken care of and tells us to ""holler"" if we need anything. Excuse me? Am I in a barn? So we finish our food and order dessert. Ughhhhhhhh it was terrible just like the food. Strawberrry shortcake..more like strawberry biscuit. Sooooo dry! Margarita pizza tasted like mediocre cheese pizza and my husbands chicken piccata, I've had frozen chicken piccata better than that.  74.00 on crap!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-la-jolla?start=20,3.68,3.26,3.136,,3.4280000000000004

My colleague had the halibut (so thick and juicy) and I had the veggie salad with Salmon (definitely will order again)  But the reason for the review is to ""thank"" CPK for the great service. Ivy was a great waitress and Steve the manager handled a situation we had very well. My boss ordered the ribeye. For some reason it was extremely salty (chef had heavy hand). I also tried it and it was really inedible.  We highlighted to the manager and they apologized profusely and immediately put a new steak on the grill. When the bill came they comped the steak (without us asking).  We take customers out to eat all the time including Qualcomm. I will bring them hear for lunch for sure because I am so pleased with the service.  I don't know why this location only has 3 stars. Their service and food is great. More importantly they know how to handle things if they aren't right.  There will always be issues. It's how you handled them which counts.

When we went there at 7pm, the front desk receptionist just said ""No your appointment is at 730pm , i remember the call , you said 730 not 7pm."" I was lil taken aback since I remember clearly that i made a reservation at 7pm. THese sort of confusions do happen, atleast have the courtesy to say "" Sorry looks like there was a confusion , let me try to find a table earlier than 730"". I have no idea how she can be so confident about remembering my call out of the numerous reservation requests they get each day. I did not want to argue with her. I requested her to find a table earlier than 730 since there were lil kids in the group. She said she can seat us in 10 mins. We just kept waiting and waiting. Went and checked the status at 730 (which she said was my reservation time), again she said 5 more minutes. Her attitude as absolutely horrible. Not the attitude you should have to work in the front desk.  Then it was 745 and by this time at least 6 other similar sized groups including some who just walked in after us had gotten tables. And there were so many tables empty. They just said they don't have enough waiters to serve the tables (note this is Saturday night, their peak business hour ). We requested to talk to the manager, and all this while this lady had the most rude attitude and was getting into our head. The manager was polite, he had the usual customer care tone. He said 10 more minutes. We just walked out and walked into Mendoccino farms near by.  No More CPK La Jolla. Too many bad experience in my last 10 years living in this area. I understand no matter what, these guys get a lot of business because of the location. So they basically do not care about customer service , being courteous etc. off late the quality of food has also gone down terribly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-la-jolla,3.36,3.24,3.136,,3.2880000000000007

I ordered the roasted vegetable salad with shrimp.  It's a large salad and you can easily share it with another person.  I asked for dressing on the side and they forgot that I asked but they rectified it and fixed my order right away.  There were seven pieces of shrimp and it was flavorful.  The roasted vegetables were cooked perfectly.  Overall, it was a really really great salad, but the price point was a little too much.  My co-workers all enjoyed their food and they stated that they would come back as well.  As for me, would I go back?  Only if I need to or want to...which would probably be not any time soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-la-jolla,3.28,3.23,3.136,,3.25

That aside, this was our first time out since. I ordered the petite wedge and crispy mac & cheese. When I got the wedge, I noticed it had egg, I had not seen it on the menu when I ordered, because quite frankly I have ordered wedge salads all over the country for many years, NEVER had I seen it come with egg, I would notice because I hate eggs, I do not use the word hate lightly here, so I sent it back, to get one without egg. Well, our server I guess decided she would teach me a lesson, by waiting until my friend was almost done with her dinner and I with the mac & cheese, ( restaurant was almost empty, btw it was not good and dry) to get the new salad, when I asked about it, she said ""Next time you will tell me no egg when you order it!""  Excuse me!!! My parents are still alive, and they wouldn't speak to me like that. It was an honest mistake, I don't need my server to school me. When I finally did get it, it gave the name ""iceberg lettuce"" a new meaning, the lettuce was so cold, that it actually hurt my teeth to eat, so I didn't, I had her box it up so I could take it home, later I decided to just throw it away.

The first thing we all noticed when walking in was that the restaurant appeared to be closed. Most lights were off, no one was standing at the hostess table and the place looked a little deserted.  Eventually we chose a table in the corner and were brought water and bread. The bread was tasty and came with herbed olive oil. We also requested balsamic vinegar to pair with the oil. They only brought out four pieces but are happy to bring more when you ask. I ordered, as always, the Thai Chicken Pizza. Along with the BBQ Chicken Pizza, it's my favorite thing at CPK. It's a very unique taste, topped with peanut sauce, bean sprouts, green onion and carrots and I always enjoy it. My friends both ordered BBQ Chicken Salads. But one of my friends had a very specific order. She asked for a lot of modifications and the waitress was happy to accommodate (i.e: switching out her cheese and tomatoes for walnuts and cranberries). But by mistake, she forgot to mention that she did not want the ranch dressing that the salad comes with. After receiving her food and noticing it was covered with ranch, she asked the waitress if it would be possible to replace the dressing on the salad, and they kindly brought her a new one.
