My wife and I visit this CPK in laguna hills all the time and we have never had a problem but maybe we have been blinded because the food is so god damn amazing....I would literally go there just to eat there ranch, its the most amazing ranch I have ever had. I normally get the tostada pizza cause its the balls, smother some ranch on it and you got your self a party. Just writing about this pizza is making me want to leave work, go get some bread and ranch to snack on until my delicious pizza is ready. There dough and crust could quite possibly be the best on the planet.

100,Tom C.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,42,1.0,1.0,2013-05-15,"Bad service, bad attitude, profiling, and no restaurant manager on duty.   We eat at CPK all over the country at least once every week sometimes more.  We've been to the CPK at Laguna Hills Mall many times over the past year as it's convenient to work and home.  On this particular night, for whatever reason, we were seated in an isolated area of the restaurant along the window to the left of the front door.  A waiter came and took our beverage order, no name badge and no introduction.  A short while later he came back and just stood silently - not saying a word.  We told him we were ready to order and asked him to take our order.  He said OK - we gave him our selections and again he just walked away without making a sound.  Shortly afterward he delivered our food and never said a word.  We felt this was ""odd"". After finishing our dinner we asked the waiter to send the manager to our table .  He said ""can I ask why"" (he actually spoke!)  We said, ""yes, it's about the service"".  He returned shortly after and said the manager was not in the restaurant right now and we responded by saying we would wait.  A little while later the kitchen manager came to see us.  We explained our experience, he apologized and said the manager was out of the restaurant at an emergency where they had to explain what was in some food that had been delivered.  He comped the bill even though we wanted to pay for our meal.  The waiter chimed in while we were speaking to the kitchen manager and said he wanted to give us some privacy and that's why he didn't speak then started to talk about the TV show ""Shark Tank"" and last weeks episode where the ""Tie Dye Guy"" wouldn't stop talking.  He said he wanted to experiment with us and not speak.  He said we looked like ""Suits"" and he didn't want to converse with us.  Our concern was he had long chats with all the other tables he was handling and during our conversation with the kitchen manager, the waiter mentioned some things my guest and I had been chatting about when no one was around which tells me he was listening from behind the waiter station partition.  The kitchen manager gave us the store manager's card and also took our card.  The kitchen manager said he would have the restaurant manager call us.  It's been almost a week now, and no contact from the CPK  manager or anyone else from CPK.  It is obvious there is some sort of ""profiling"" happening at this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-laguna-hills?start=140,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.308,3.1600000000000006

Yup this is how you mess up a soup and salad. Why didnt they tell us they didnt have our order when we called or come out to tell us they screwed up.

Our hostess seated us immediately, even though the restaurant was bustling with diners.  Though I highly recommend the outdoor patio dining at this location, we took a spacious table indoors to avoid the threat of much needed rain.   CPK is known for the uniquely yummy pizzas (go figure), but check out their expansive menu for other great options:   --small plates, including Bianco Flatbread with whipped truffle cream and Crispy Mac & Cheese (can you say ""Mmmm""?) --Pastas dishes spanning from Tequila Fettuccini to Kung Pao Spaghetti (and the traditional fare, for the less adventurous) --Desserts to make any mouth water: Salted Caramel Pudding and a decadent Red Velvet cake, to name a couple. But I go to CPK for their incredibly scrumptious salads, and this time did not disappoint. I tried the Caramelized Peach Salad, and it was a-ma-zing!  Lovely tender spring greens, adorned with warm, sweet peach slices and tangy vinaigrette.  It was a harmonious fusion of nectar and candied cranberries, along with crunchy pecans and savory gorgonzola cheese. I added on the bacon option, which proved heavenly. My sister ordered their classic ""California Cobb"" with CPK's house made Herb Ranch.  Always hardy, it was made even more vibrant with the addition of fresh beet (which delighted her, since that vege is her FAV.) The place was really hopping, so a tad noisy when we first started, but by the time our entrée's arrived, it was already down to joyful lull of cheerful patrons.  The manager, Karleen, made her way around to check in on her happy patrons, stopping by our table for a pleasant chat, before helping a server with an armload of plates.  The entire staff was upbeat, which set a relaxed atmosphere...the way you always hoped casually dining would be. The entrance to the Laguna Hills CPK is off the parking lot between JCP and Macy's; no access from the inside of the mall.  The convenient location might be one reason this restaurant is doing well, despite some store closings recently.  More likely it's the energetic vibe of this place, along with equally tasty dishes and a super welcoming staff. It's the best CPK around, any way you slice it",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-laguna-hills?start=80,2.92,2.92,2.92,3.2520000000000002,2.92

The food  at this location is completely and totally mehhhh... I always end up with one of their cardboard tasting and looking pies. After I eat here, I ask myself what the hell I was thinking in being willing to come here again. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! none the less,  Now to make things even more fun and exciting. The service is kinda haphazard and they appear to have servers, not waiters. Dont expect to get much ""service""  from the wait staff as they are too busy to bother with you most of the time. Also I suggest that you make sure to check your bill everytime, as on more than one occasion I have had an incorrect bill. It is a serious pain in the butt, but yeah, I am not a fan of this location whatsoever.

Feeling thirsty as we waited for our pizza, we ordered beverages. My drink was ginger ale ($2.69 with complimentary refills), my husband ordered Lemonade. The drinks were just what we needed to hydrate. The pizza didn't take long to arrive; the kitchen is fast. My pizza was the Hawaiian (pineapple, ham and green onion) and it was artistically presented. The chefs do a good job of making the pizza look pretty. The appetizer, food and drink were very good.

21,A J.,"San Clemente, CA",0,53,,4.0,2015-05-10,"It's CPK... what's there to say? Actually, I'm only reviewing the restaurant today, on Mother's Day, because I haven't been in years and I was VERY impressed with the staff. First, a manager presented carnations to the two mothers in our party before we were seated. That was a nice touch. Then, our server, Jordan, was extremely enthusiastic and cheerful, despite working her socks off for the Mother's Day crowd. You could tell the entire staff was feeling the pressure, but none of them seemed to mind. And, finally, Luis... a busser, who was right in the thick of it. At one point, a manager was walking across the dining room with some dishes he had cleared from a table. He unknowingly dropped a napkin on the floor and kept going. Moments later, Luis came around the corner, on his way to clear another table. Luis saw the napkin and immediately picked it up. I like that. I like that Luis took enough pride in the restaurant to pick up the napkin, even though he wasn't the one who dropped it. You may think this is a small thing, but many employees at many different restaurants would walk right past that napkin, either because they wouldn't notice it, or because they would pretend they didn't notice it. Nice job, Luis. Now, the bad. I ordered the Habanero Carnitas pizza. It was delicious, except for the fact that it had tons of onions on it... onions that weren't mentioned on the menu... onions that I would have asked to be held, had the menu listed them in the description. Ugh. Onions.

I experienced this transformation firsthand in the grand opening of the Irvine store in which I sampled so many amazing new menu items and drinks that I am constantly recommending them to friends and family and CPK has a spot on my go to list. But I digress. Since my last review of this particular location I have dined here twice and both times the food, drink and service were topnotch. Last visit I convinced my husband to try the ribeye and he was not disappointed. ""One of the best steaks I've ever eaten,"" he commented. I just smiled, having sampled it already at the opening while I dined on my personal favorite the thai chicken pizza which I am pleased to say this store has lightened up big time on the carrots and it was cooked thoroughly (Thank you!!!!) He is still sore that CPH eliminated the cheesburger pizza but is fast overcoming his grudge. Yesterday I came in with a friend and having raved about the Blood Orange Sangria we both had one then shared my next favorite: the mushroom pizza with truffle oil and a garden salad. She loved the pizza and liked her drink, too. I am always happy to introduce people to new things and being a foodie that is on the top of my list. The pizza was perfectly cooked, the mushrooms just delicious and the added truffle oil of course made it amazing. Our drinks were a little strong but hey who am i to complain? :) They were very good. So I am a fan again and very happy for the changes. My friend, having not been in since the changes, remarked that she was glad this store was given a facelift and is glad to see many other restaurants following suit.

118,Chelsea M.,"Fullerton, CA",628,573,156.0,4.0,2015-11-17,"Brussels + Bacon Flatbread ($8.29) is topped with roasted Brussels sprouts, sweet caramelized onions, Nueske's Applewood smoked bacon, creamy goat cheese, Romano, and cracked black pepper. It hits the flavor spikes with sweet onion, roasted Brussels sprouts, smoky & salty bacon, and creamy goat cheese. A pesto drizzle would add a nice herbaceous component to tie everything together. Rating: 4.3/5 Fire-Grilled Ribeye ($25.99) is a 12 oz. USDA choice ribeye with house made Pinot Noir sea salt, topped with creamy bleu cheese butter, and served with roasted fingerling potatoes and lemon-garlic arugula salad. The ribeye is tender, juicy, and grilled to perfection and cuts like butter. The compound butter brings out the sweetness of the beef while also adding a pungent yet paired flavor. The potatoes are roasted perfectly with a crispy side and a pleasing herbaceous flavor. The arugula salad's bitterness is tempered by the lemon garlic vinaigrette and reminiscent of a fresh spinach. Rating: 4.8/5 Sunny Side Up Bacon + Potato Pizza ($15.99) is topped with shaved fingerling potatoes, Nueske's Applewood smoked bacon, caramelized leeks, parmesan, mozzarella, fresh cracked black pepper, and two sunny-side eggs. Breakfast pizza any time! The crust is crispy yet tender and chewy like a good bread. The yolk makes this pizza even sexier with is bright orange color and sensual flow as it ends up on the pizza, on your fingers, and on your face. Definitely, yolk porn! If this would be shared, opting for two extra sunny side eggs would make everyone happy. The thinly cut potatoes can be a little inconsistent ranging from cooked just right to just hard and dry from the high heat. Cubing the potatoes like O'Brien potatoes might work better. Rating: 4.3/5 Spicy Chipotle Chicken Pizza ($13.49) is topped with chipotle adobo sauce, shaved poblanos, Monterey jack, house made roasted corn & black bean salsa, and lime crema. The fiery colors on this pizza pop when presented - green, yellow, and red with contrasting black beans and golden crust. The Hispanic flavor palette ranges from the smoky chipotle, sweet bell peppers and corn, starchy beans, to a pleasant spicy kick at the end. Less vegetables or more chicken would be preferable to bring out more of the smoky chipotle flavor. Rating: 4.3/5 Hearth-Roasted Halibut ($23.79) is wild caught Alaskan halibut roasted on a cedar plank with grilled asparagus and butternut squash farro & baby kale. The halibut is succulent with the slight smoky cedar flavor and fresh taste of the sea. Butternut squash farro and baby kale taste like a cheesy, nutty risotto with a touch of sweetness from the butternut squash. The thin asparagus adds a sweet greenness to the dish. Rating: 4.5/5 S'mores ($5.50) is kettle cooked Belgian chocolate pudding, dark chocolate chunks, double graham crackers, and toasted marshmallows. The decorative preserves jar makes the s'mores the focal point. The Belgian chocolate pudding acts as your melted chocolate but is cool like a dense mousse. Double graham crackers add a crunchy texture and sweet wheat flavor. Marshmallows are perfectly torched and gooey for a short while. The cold pudding makes the marshmallows solidify too fast. Marshmallow fluff might be better to preserve the texture of the dish. It will achieve the torched exterior yet stay gooey and soft with the pudding.

But then I saw the Roasted Veggie Salad, which I also used to love the hell out of.  I've had better, at other CPK's.  This one, had some weird things in it, like a Bay Leaf I believe, which I was gnawing on and had to dig out of my teeth.  And I added salmon (this is now a $20 salad, full size plus salmon) and the salmon was not good.  It was dry, seemed like maybe it had been fried?  Weird.  Also I remember the veggies being warm on the salad, these were not.  Maybe that is my faulty memory.  But the salmon was possibly from the day before, and was not good.  But I am not one to make a huge fuss at a restaurant unless I think I might get food poisoning. Other than that, everything was great.  Matt was our server, on the patio.  We were alone on the patio, as we had a 3 1/2 year old with LOTS OF ENERGY with  us, also my sister is still breastfeeding the baby, and my grandma's friend is 92, and super spry, but I don't know how well her hearing is for a restaurant atmosphere, at lunch...it can get loud.  So the patio was perfect for us, we were not irritating other diners, we could hear eachother, and my sister could whip out her boob to feed the baby without much concern.   Matt was very nice and attentive and brought us everything we needed, was good with the toddler, etc.  Thank you Matt. All the rest of the food was good, from what I understand.  My sister got the Sedona Tortilla Soup, no complaints.  My mom and nephew both had the split pea soup or whatever. Barley?  Said it was good.  My nephew pretty much ate the bread non stop, not sure how much soup he ingested.  Grandma's friend had her standard Cobb or Club (?) Eggrolls?  We got an extra order of those for the table to start, so I also tasted those, pretty good.   Aside from the salmon being yucky, it was 5 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-laguna-hills?start=20,3.68,3.68,3.68,3.408,3.6800000000000006

I figured I couldn't go wrong with their pizza since it is always so yummy. WRONG. Apparently, I didn't realize the spicy marinara was in the Sicilian pizza I ordered. It was way too hot for me. I also ordered the chicken tequila fettuccine because it was marked as a favorite. I didn't care for it all. Our server, Emily was very perceptive and saw that I wasn't eating much. She asked if she could bring me something else from the menu.  I told her that I felt bad and it wasn't necessary. She insisted. Then her manager, Elaine, came over and apologized that I didn't care for the food and insisted I order something else. Both of these ladies were kind and sincere and I was very impressed with their customer service. I ordered a third item, shrimp scampi zucchini. The sauce was thin, not creamy. It tasted like fresh squeezed lemon sauce. I did not let them know that I was disappointed again but I will not be going back to CPK for dinner again.

Now my hot date knows I'm a gift carder and I'm back on Bumble. Won't be returning or maybe I'll call ahead to see if their gift card system is online, since I still have this CPK gift card in my wallet mocking me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-laguna-hills?start=40,3.32,3.34,3.34,,3.3320000000000003

46,Carlene P.,"Lake Forest, CA",39,238,187.0,5.0,2017-07-08,"The Laguna Hills Mall is under complete renovation, but fear not - CPK is open! I loved the ability to place take-out orders online  -  you're given the choice to pay with a card online or to pay when you arrive.  Nice to have this choice.   The take-out pick-up counter is at the bar or you can request curbside pick-up.  Since the mall is under reconstruction, it's not busy so it's always easy to find good parking. The service was excellent.  The waiter was outgoing, polite, and let me know that it would be just a minute or two longer before my order was ready.  He offered bread with the salad which comes with olive oil for dipping.  I wasn't crazy about this, but if that's your thing, they've got your covered. My husband ordered the Hawaiian pizza and although good, he felt it was too heavy on the ham.  Next time he'll just get a pineapple pizza most likely (hey, don't judge...he's a great guy!) I had a Caesar salad and it was quite good.  Very generous with both the parm and the croutons.  Could maybe have used just a smidge more dressing, but it was still tasty.   The kids pizza is just about the right size for little ones without huge appetites and it comes with either juice, milk or soda.   There is outside patio dining or indoors.  As with most CPK's this location is very modern and clean.  They just need to build the rest of the mall around it and this place will be standing room only.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-laguna-hills,3.48,3.38,3.38,,3.4200000000000004

53,David E.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",38,843,,3.0,2017-07-30,As with other chains of this type they have adjusted their menu in order to better appeal to the masses.  There still isn't much of a health conscious focus here but of course the nutritional information is provided so you can make better choices. ITALIAN CHOPPED SALAD -- I would never notice that the turkey breast was roasted since it is in tiny cubes (still better than slivers or strips of meat given this type of salad); salami; garbanzo beans; tomatoes (I had to veto for health reasons); mozzarella; fresh basil; mustard herb vinaigrette The dressing tastes like it sounds as it's a combo of Italian dressing meats mustard.  It's good but the Italian flavor prevails over the mustard making it much less detectable.  The salami is in thin strips.  There is a pretty ample amount of meat.  The salad is a good portion (large) but at $17.00 feels a bit costly for what it is.   Cubes of fairly soft bread are served with a herb olive oil dipping sauce (not enough in the container). The STAFF are friendly and the dining room is similar to my last memory of it.  My guess is I haven't been inside of one of these in 16 years.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-laguna-hills,3.48,3.38,3.38,,3.4200000000000004
105,Jack D.,"Laguna Beach, CA",107,41,6.0,1.0,2017-08-04,So this time around we decided we would give the old California Pizza Kitchen in other go and order the pasta bolognese with meat sauce. Upon delivering it to the table we realized they had the pasta part going on but the meat sauce was sorely lacking so we requested some meat sauce. Upon receiving the bill we realized we were charged $2 for meat sauce that it should have come with originally. When you're charging $14 for pasta you would think that a customer request for additional meat sauce wouldn't generate an additional charge. Unfortunately this place was once one of my favorites and now they have lost my business over something very trivial.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-laguna-hills?start=20,3.32,3.34,3.34,,3.3320000000000003

Most people got their drinks first, but one person didn't get theirs so they had to ask. They got theirs after we got our appetizers. To drink I got a Coke. To start they just had bread, olive oil and butter that came out for everyone. I liked the olive oil.  After appetizers we all ordered for our entree. I got the roasted garlic chicken thin crust pizza. My Mom got a cob salad with beets and she gave some of that to me. It was good, I liked the ranch. My Mom didn't get beets with her cob salad though. She realized that when we got the bill. My Aunt also gave me some of her asparagus and arugula salad with shrimp. I liked it, especially the shrimp. My pizza turned out alright. It was kinda skimpy on the toppings though. It was like they stopped stopped putting toppings on 1/4th of the pizza near the crust.  We got dessert. My Aunt had ordered it in advance, we didn't know she did until it came out. My Cousin got a free fudge sundae thing with a candle for his birthday. We also had butter cake and a chocolate souffle. They were both pretty good. They were moist and not too sweet. The butter cake was my favorite out of the two.

During our visit I tried to ask another waiter and manager for a water refill. I held my glass up and made eye contact three times. When they were almost to the bar I raised my empty glass in the air above my head, they glanced, but they did not stop.  A minute later my son and I got more water.  So they saw me but did not want to acknowledge us.  We typically don't stop at this location due to the bad service, this seems to be the norm. Now I could understand if they were busy.

42,Deb L.,"Laguna Hills, CA",2,17,,1.0,2017-12-12,"Update: since I posted the below review, I have been searching for a good Chinese chicken salad to replace California Pizza Kitchen's, which has recently been taken off the menu. Good news! I have found a good substitute! Pick Up Stix Chinese restaurant has an excellent one-as good as CPK's, and less expensive. Now I have no reason to patronize CPK again, since that salad was the best thing on the menu. .................... I have been  coming to Ca Pizza Kitchen for years and have ordered the Chinese chicken salad for years. It is so tasty, that even when I stopped eating meat, I replaced the chicken with avocado and continued to order this delicious salad. Today I attempted to place my usual order only to learn this salad has been taken off the menu.  The salad choices are now largely high caloric salads. The newest salad, which apparently replaced the Chinese chicken salad, is an arugula asparagus salad which is a poor substitute. The waiter told  me many people continue to ask for the Chinese chicken salad. I guess i'll have to find another restaurant for my weekly salad obsession.
