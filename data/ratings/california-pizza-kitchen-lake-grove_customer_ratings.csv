I don't feel right about giving a chain restaurant more than three stars, but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with this place, it wasn't that bad.

That was not the best experience and things seemed to have gone South as far as food quality and service. Tonight was a much better experience and CPK earned back some brownie points. It was late, past the normal dinner time rush, the place was pretty empty and we were pressed for time so it was nice to have the food come out rather quickly.  Due to the hour we ate on the light side splitting the classic BBQ chicken chopped salad, Bianco flatbread and Belgian chocolate suffle cake. Everything was really good and wouldn't hesitate to recommend ordering any of the dishes. I've had the BBQ chicken chopped salad many times before but not in a lng time and was reminded of why it's a classic at CPK. First time, but not the last, for both the Bianco flatbread and Belgian chcocolate suffle cake.

My mom and sister ALWAYS get the Jamaican Jerk Pizza. It's pretty tasty. This location is pretty solid. We usually come around for lunch, when it's not crowded.

The portion sizes were perfect and each platter tasted good. The service was prompt and friendly. Sure, it's a chain restaurant and us New Yorkers are a pretentious lot when it comes to pizza so most of the negative reviews here have no gravitas.

I once again ordered a gluten free pie, and told the waitress I had some issues in the past.  When our food was delivered, the manager came over and told me she supervised the production of the pizza and to contact her if I had any issues.  The pizza this time was gluten free, but tasted MUCH different than the last time I was here, leading me to believe they gave me a regular pie last time.  In addition, we had a drink at the bar before our group arrived and their credit card machine went down, so the bartender added it to our food bill. Imagine my surprised when the charge showed up anyway on my bill. I called the store to have it resolved and it eventually was, but still annoying.

This place is literally never ever ever ever full. You can go in on a Friday night at 6, or Saturday at lunch, it doesn't matter. My mom loves CPK, so we find ourselves frequenting this one often mainly because....well there's a wait in other places. Anytime we know we can't wait, and just want some good food, we come here. Their food is always consistently good, and I have actually never really had a bad CPK experience here. Seating is fast (lol), food comes out quick, good servers, etc. What I got a few weeks ago and really really enjoyed: -the dumpling appetizer -the thai crunch salad - if you like salads, this one is one of the best I've had -the salted caramel pudding dessert - OMG. serious. for serious. I literally said OMG when tasting it.  So, if you're in the area, want good CPK food at a good price, and need to get in and get out, come here!

When we got there we quickly seated and had our drink orders taken, which then came out fast. After deciding on what we were ordering we received our appetizer in a very timely fashion (we ordered the ginger chicken dumplings, which were fantastic), and the thin crust pizza we ordered came out relatively fast as well (Jamaican Jerk Chicken pizza). The pizza was very well done, not undercooked, good seasonings. We then split a chocolate souffle which came out faster than the pizza and dumplings.

There seems to never be a wait, compared to the other restaurants around it.  For appetizers we will ALWAYS order the avocado egg rolls, they are delicious and come out quickly. They serve them with what i believe is a ranch dipping sauce and another sauce that has a little spice to it.  Have tried multiple pizzas and all were great. If you're not in a pizza mood, the four cheese raviloi is amazing and is perfectly portioned. At the end of your meal they also give you a coupon you can't open until the next time you are there to find out how much it is for, which pretty much insures we will be eating here again in the near future.

33,Christina P.,"Wading River, NY",76,54,112.0,2.0,2015-05-08,"Haven't had a bad dining experience like this in a while. I used to come here about a year ago and the place would be packed out and there was always a wait on weekends. To my surprise on a Friday evening at dinner time there was no wait. Sat with a couple other people. The waitress didn't understand any general questions we had about the food. I asked about how a certain dish was served and she was wrong about it. Okay now about what we ordered- the Cobb salad had burnt bacon in it that was so black it looked like a thin piece of charcoal. The lettuce wrap appetizer is one of those ""make your own"" things. Doesn't say that on the menu. Now I might not mind if I was at some random pub-- but to be at a nice restaurant I don't like having to make my own anything using my hands. The app comes with huge pieces from a head of lettuce that are way too big to fill, impossible to wrap and roll them and messy to eat, the mixture and sauce to fill them with tasted good at first but after eating it for a little was nauseating. The whole thing was very messy and hard to eat. It came with shrimp that were undercooked tiny pieces of garbage shrimp. The waitress asked if we were still working on our plates as we had our forks in hand, chewing a mouthful of food and stood there waiting for a response. Lol just kind of comical. Bad experience altogether and not going back any time soon.

Even in between that time frame  our waiter came over and asked do you want refills we said yes, and that's when he disappeared. I had gotten the barbecue chicken pizza, which after sitting under a heat lamp for 20 minutes means the red onions are all wilted the pizza was hard to break apart. The waiter could tell I was disappointed and got the manager, so I waited another 20 minutes for them to make me another pizza which I ended up eating one slice due from picking on my boyfriends food who luckily for a cold sandwich....

It was butter with bread. We are waiting for our food when I hear Ken behind the bar talking to a tall waitress about smoking marijuana and blunts.. Like REALLY!!! I mean I'm liberal but these are not conversations for working hours. We've waited now 30 minutes and out pizzas are still not here although line I said.. PLACE IS EMPTY!!

You don't necessarily think of pizza when you think of California but it wasn't too bad. My girlfriend loves this place and suggested it . The ambience is quite nice. We ordered the avocado egg rolls as an appetizer which had tomatoes and chicken in it. It was a little too greasy but the flavor was good. I ordered the roasted garlic chicken pizza which was pretty good. It had caramelized onions, mozzarella, grilled chicken and of course garlic. I was pleased with my meal . In my opinion, the menu was a little overpriced for the pizza. The personal pies which are equivalent to around 2 slices are between 12-16 dollars. They have a variety of slices though.

Came for lunch today since the Cheesecake Factory had a 45 minute wait and we weren't in the mood for Bobby's Burger Palace. Now I realize we should've had BBP instead of CPK. First of all we must've stood waiting for a table for an empty restaurant for at least 3-5 minutes. I mean plenty of employees around just it seemed like no one wanted to seat us. We finally got seated and it took a few more minutes to get greeted by our waiter. We decided we'd get the following: - Avocado Egg Rolls: which we used to love and they were just OK. - Tostada Pizza: which states that it's a crispy thin crust. This was more like a limp thin crust. Sorry this was just blah. It seemed like maybe one of the managers or cooks came around and asked us how our meal was. When we mentioned how the pizza was rather flimsy she asked if we wanted another one and we opted not to. Only to reply back to us with to order it more well done next time. How about no? It states it's a crispy thin crust and therefore it should be crispy without me having to specify that it should be more well done. Our server was nice but didn't bother to ask us how everything was. Maybe he could tell we were aggravated and just didn't add gas to the fire. Sorry CPK... but I don't think we'll ever be back after this. You used to be awesome with the potato salad, the egg rolls, and the spinach dip. Even the key lime pie used to be amazing!!! But now not so much.

The rest of the appetizer choices were also types that you won't find at most other places which can be a good thing or bad thing depending what you're in the mood for. My boyfriend typically tries their pasta dishes each time we go and never fails to be disappointed. I prefer trying out their diff flavors of pizza since they are called California Pizza Kitchen for a reason. I tried the Original BBQ Chicken pizza last time and was not a huge fan. It had good flavor and i love pineapples on my pizza but the BBQ sauce made the dough super mushy. Yesterday I tried the spinach and artichoke thin crust pizza and was much more satisfied. Amazing flavor and the thin crust is crispier which prevented it from any mush.
