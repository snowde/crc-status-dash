I had two ""coupons"" or offers on my account -- one for ten dollars off, and another for a free birthday dessert. When I spoke to the woman on the phone, she assured me that I could use both. Since I had never used any before, I thought this was great, and I deferred to her statement, since she works for the company.  I pulled up to the designated parking area, and I called the number to say I was there. It took what seemed like forever to get someone to come out. When a person did arrive, the coupons were not on the statement. So, the girl went back in to check my account. Forever passed again. A guy came out this time, telling me that I could only use one of the coupons/offers. I said that I was told differently. He said he'd go in and ask his manager. At this point, so much time was being wasted that I just decided to walk in and take care of it at the counter. I didn't want to spend the next hour dealing with this walking back and forth from the car. Once inside, it took another twenty minutes. I was told that I was given the wrong information, and they took off the birthday cake. They printed me a new receipt and removed the dessert from my bag.  Now, I don't ""need"" a birthday cake, but I thought it was in very poor taste to take that off.

13,Akisha B.,"Norwalk, CA",707,302,745.0,2.0,2014-06-12,"I usually don't write a review for chain restaurants, because the same foods is served at each restaurant. So when I do write a review, it has to be because of impeccable service or the opposite. Well my experience was the opposite.  My mother and I are seated, given menus and then order is taken. We knew what we wanted, so we ordered right away. (Lunch menu: 7"" mushroom and spinach pizza and Mediterranean salad for $10.95) Now maybe you have to request for a basket of bread and oil, but we weren't offered any. And the fact that other tables were given bread and oil,  just kind of rubbed me the wrong way. Our food arrives, and we have no napkins. Our waitress never came to check on us. We only seen her when we ordered our food and when it was time to pay for our food. So customer service here was WACK! Don't get me wrong, the waitress was nice when we did see her, but she did a terrible job checking on us. And what really sealed the deal, given spoons 4 times and each time the spoon was dirty. So it's dessert time. I ordered the butter cake with ice cream. 5 stars just for this dessert. The butter cake is oh so good! Ok, now back to the dirty spoons. With our dessert, we are given a spoon. The spoon had dried up cheese, and the other spoon has dried up food particles on the handle. ""Gross! I'm not putting my mouth on those spoons."" So we ask for two more spoons. What do you know, both spoons are dirty. ""Dang, do y'all wash these utensils? "" Apparently not! At this point my ice cream is melting and I'm frustrated with these spoons. So this time, I tell the waitress to just give me some plastic spoons. Whew, finally can dig into my butter cake.

So when I do write a review, it has to be because of impeccable service or the opposite. Well my experience was the opposite.  My mother and I are seated, given menus and then order is taken. We knew what we wanted, so we ordered right away. (Lunch menu: 7"" mushroom and spinach pizza and Mediterranean salad for $10.95) Now maybe you have to request for a basket of bread and oil, but we weren't offered any. And the fact that other tables were given bread and oil,  just kind of rubbed me the wrong way. Our food arrives, and we have no napkins. Our waitress never came to check on us. We only seen her when we ordered our food and when it was time to pay for our food. So customer service here was WACK! Don't get me wrong, the waitress was nice when we did see her, but she did a terrible job checking on us. And what really sealed the deal, given spoons 4 times and each time the spoon was dirty. So it's dessert time. I ordered the butter cake with ice cream. 5 stars just for this dessert. The butter cake is oh so good! Ok, now back to the dirty spoons. With our dessert, we are given a spoon. The spoon had dried up cheese, and the other spoon has dried up food particles on the handle. ""Gross! I'm not putting my mouth on those spoons."" So we ask for two more spoons. What do you know, both spoons are dirty. ""Dang, do y'all wash these utensils? "" Apparently not! At this point my ice cream is melting and I'm frustrated with these spoons. So this time, I tell the waitress to just give me some plastic spoons. Whew, finally can dig into my butter cake. I think I'm going to start bringing my own silverware or plastic ware to restaurants.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lakewood-3?start=40,2.88,2.88,2.88,3.3360000000000003,2.88

The thin crust also allows the flavors to be a bit overpowering so I normally ask for easy sauce. 3 1/2 stars   BBQ CHICKEN SALAD big portion but for the price of $14 I don't thing it's worth it. Just iceberg lettuce chopped into little pieces with  corn, jicama, onions, beans, tomatoes topped with chicken. Ask for BBQ sauce and ranch on the side they tent to smother the salad in dressing. 3 stars  RED VELVET CAKE- probably one of better red velvet cakes I've ever had. It's not too sweet and the cake portion is always moist and perfect. Paired it with ice cream this last time and it was too much going on.

JERK PIZZA it's big enough to share with another person but the crust is thin so the pizza doesn't make you overwhelmingly full. The thin crust also allows the flavors to be a bit overpowering so I normally ask for easy sauce. 3 1/2 stars   BBQ CHICKEN SALAD big portion but for the price of $14 I don't thing it's worth it. Just iceberg lettuce chopped into little pieces with  corn, jicama, onions, beans, tomatoes topped with chicken. Ask for BBQ sauce and ranch on the side they tent to smother the salad in dressing. 3 stars  RED VELVET CAKE- probably one of better red velvet cakes I've ever had. It's not too sweet and the cake portion is always moist and perfect. Paired it with ice cream this last time and it was too much going on. I'll stick with just a slice of red velvet cake by itself. 4 1/2 stars  This location is big and roomy. Staff is average when it comes to service and attentiveness.

Sure, their prices are a bit excessive but the food is actually pretty darn good. I like CPK because they put many different kinds of ingredients on their pizza, hot and/or cold. It's quite innovative - I mean, who puts cold ingredients on a warm pizza and gets away with it? Thank goodness CPK does.  Okay, so everyone talks about the pizza...well, duh...its California PIZZA Kitchen. Now, what is really underrated are the PASTAS. I love pasta...and it's really hard to compare other pastas to CPK because, again, they combine ingredients that is just nothing short of excellent. Of course it's not traditional Italian pasta but I'm basing my review on the taste of the food, not authenticity. I highly recommend their Chicken Tequila Fettuccine. It's great, get it.

My husband was told that the order was still being worked on. At 6:38pm, my husband called me to tell me that he was still waiting on the order so this was now over an hour that our food was still not ready. I called the resturant to speak with the manager because they kept telling my husband they were working on it. I was connected with someone named Eric who said again that order was still being prepared and when I asked why it has taken over an hour for my order, he replied that he doesn't have an answer except that they are busy.

157,Fatima K.,"Harbor City, United States",128,217,615.0,4.0,2016-10-17,I'm so happy that they have a sit down restaurant attached to this mall. I had to stop by the Disney store for my son's Buzz Lightyear costume. They were out of all sizes at the Del Amo mall so I had to make my way all the way down to Lakewood. The mall has a pretty small foodcourt and we were getting ready to leave the mall and head to another restaurant when we spotted a CPK. YAY! #1 BEWARE!!! The mall closes earlier than CPK so if you're parked anywhere other than the CPK entrance you're going to have to walk ALL the way around to your car bc they close all the exits. So move your car to right outside CPK. Also this mall closes early.  This location isn't a huge one but it's cute and the service was good. I prefer my regular location but this was a good experience too.  I like having an option in the mall where I can grab a salad for myself and a pizza for my son without mall hopping all around the food court.  The food was good. They made a darn good salad(BBQ chopped salad) and the butter cake was SO good!!! Honestly I think it's better than Mastro's.

My girlfriend got the NEW Carne Asada Pizza and it was nothing short of spectacular! The green salsa you add with each slice was also delicious! Highly recommend if you love Carne Asada! My mother got traditional BBQ Chicken Pizza that is a CPK original! The flavor was top notch and was made to perfection! My mother absolutely loved it! Always a good item to choose if you are playing it safe, because it's consistently delicious. This location has plenty of mall parking, has a nice clean ambiance to it, and employees that provide excellent service! I'll definitely be back!
