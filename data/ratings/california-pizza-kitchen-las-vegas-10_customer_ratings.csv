85,Sam S.,"Las Vegas, NV",54,34,,2.0,2014-11-19,"Just opened today in downtown summerlin. Went for lunch w a colleague. Food was as expected from a CPK and the set up of the restaurant was really nice. This is the 3rd restaurant in the new shopping area that I've been to on opening day and the staff is always a little over zealous and nervous on the first day but jeez, the staff here today was annoying as hell. First, there were probably as many people in staff as there were eating. Our server interrupted us frequently, and was heavily pushing from the start a dessert we had no interest in for lunch. My food was almost taken out of my hand while I was still eating. I was asked probably 10 times in 10 minutes if I was done or wanted a to go box from about 6 different staffers. Also was additionally asked the same over and over for drink refills after we said no.  I'm excited about the new restaurant but just let people eat and enjoy the food and atmosphere! We were patient and understanding for a while but it got to be too much so we left and walked around for a bit. I'll come back but I hope the servers will be more acclimated and less pressured to sell and serve. It's obviously coming from the management but there's a fine line between being helpful and ruining the experience. I'd suggest going here to check it out but maybe after they've been in business a month or so.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-10?start=120,3.1440000000000006,3.1440000000000006,3.1440000000000006,3.1440000000000006,3.1440000000000006
143,Diana W.,"North Las Vegas, NV",47,2,,5.0,2014-11-20,Food was good Service was amazing  Way better than the Crave opening we went to next door a few weeks ago. We ended up walking out of Crave.

22,Ania K.,"Las Vegas, NV",2515,431,6001.0,3.0,2014-11-20,"Opening night, had no idea until we sat down. With that said I always stay away from these types of things because things are never in order. Overall it wasn't bad but you could definitely feel the tension & nervousness in the air from the entire staff. We had about 5 different employees check in on us :) Things were a little off all night, not so much with the service but with the food. The soups weren't warm enough, bread wasn't delivered, very little sauce on the Thai pizza so we had to ask for more on the side. Little things like that but it's expected on opening night.  I recommend restaurants start offering a little discount or even a complimentary little something like starter or mini dessert for grand openings. If I'm paying full price I expect them to be prepared.  The restaurant itself is beautiful, very cool loft like feel & the seating was very comfortable, great job on the decor!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-10?start=80,3.2440000000000007,3.2440000000000007,3.2440000000000007,3.2440000000000007,3.2440000000000007
154,Emily H.,"Las Vegas, NV",25,66,11.0,3.0,2014-11-25,"Good service for just opening. I wouldn't even have guessed they were new if I wasn't from Vegas. Two things: 1. They did not have sandwiches on the menu I got, I thought that was odd because I always have the one of the chicken sandwiches, & I saw some trays with sandwiches at the end of my meal. Hopefully my sandwich is back next time. 2: The wait to be seated was rather long to be honest. They have an option where they'll send you a text when you're next on the wait list, so you can go shop around if the wait is lengthy. Cool, but they told me it was going to be 15 minutes, but I hung out for about 30 instead. Accurate wait times ARE important! I would've gone to shop a little if I knew I had double the time. Food was good, hot, and the wait wasn't too long on that.

Some staff members I came into contact with while there were very polite and helpful.  I was greeted at the door and then one of the staff escorted me to the take out area near the rear of the restaurant.  I was checked out promptly.  This CPK is 3/4 of a mile from where I live so I was home in no time at all.   The pizza was good.  It's the first time I've had CPK pizza.  I wasn't blown away and I'm not sure if this will be an option I go to often.  There are some good places nearby that do a better pizza for the same price.  The part of dinner that did grab me was the salted caramel pudding.  This was very good and I'd go back simply for that dessert.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-10?start=60,3.2440000000000007,3.2440000000000007,3.2440000000000007,3.2440000000000007,3.2440000000000007

The best part was that she was Hispanic that way my mom could ask questions and I didn't have to translate  my mom loved her too.

It was about 8 of us and the service was pretty good. Didn't have to wait long to place an order not for our food to arrive. Everyone was satisfied with their food selection and the server made sure our glasses remained full. I really loved the decor of the place. It was not like your typical CPK.

Was told 15 min wait and they seated us in 5 min.  Our server was attentive and got the drinks out quick and refilled often.  Our order was spot on and all food was excellent.  Kids meals were well portioned...

We called ahead for a table and still had to wait 15 minutes in the entrance with 100 other people before it was ready. Food was consistent with other CPK locations. It's a chain. It should be. I'm glad they have quality control. Lunch specials are pretty good - half pizza or sandwich and salad or soup for under $11. The salad choices are restricted to three which aren't among their standard salad options so I went with a regular full sized salad which ended up being $14. Huge, and delicious. I tried a bite of the BBQ pulled chicken sandwich and it was excellent. Great location in downtown Summerlin so you can have a meal in a slightly nicer restaurant than a fast food tray type situation in between shops.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-10?start=120,3.248,3.248,3.248,3.248,3.248

My boyfriend and I went here for New Year's Day lunch - it wasn't that busy as I thought it would, thank jeebus. When we first arrived, we asked how long the wait would be but we ended up sitting at the bar anyways. The bartender was very friendly and I got my beer right away.  My boyfriend got some type of soup and it was farely good. They had actually forgotten that they had already brought us one and had brought another one out. When I looked at it, there was a really long piece of hair in it and let the waitress know - her reaction? ""Eww""...I was like uh ok, no apology, she just took it away. Starting from this point, I was very weary and probably spent more time looking through every morsel of food I picked up with my fork than actually enjoying my food. I had gotten the garlic chicken pasta and my boyfriend had gotten some type of garlic pizza - we love garlic, obviously haha but before every bite, we made sure there wasn't any hair on it. It was actualy quite tiring. We had a lot of food left over and ended up taking it home...to throw away.  All in all, I wouldn't return here because that piece of hair made me think that the cooks are not properly putting on hair nets or whatever if at all!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-10?start=100,2.9480000000000004,2.9480000000000004,2.9480000000000004,2.9480000000000004,2.9480000000000004

82,V W.,"Las Vegas, NV",572,602,197.0,1.0,2015-01-09,"CPK leaves much to be desired in their food presentation and portions. I came to this new location with a friend and we ordered 2 salads of the same size, but different types. What was served was very odd to say the least and pretty darn disappointing.  I had asked for my salad to be modified, because I can not eat onions and everything seemed okay until the waitress came back to mention a small issue.  The waitress had said that she could make me an Asian chicken salad, but the cabbage with the onions would not be included, so she suggested that I add more romaine instead. I thought nothing of it and agreed to her suggestion.  What was weird is that this simple modification became a small food nightmare for me. I did not realize that just by subtracting an item that I am allergic to I was going to get a miserly portion. This really should not be the case.  As I had mentioned earlier my friend and I ordered the same size salad and my was literally half her size, yet we paid the same price for it.  The worst part is that I literally got about maybe 2 oz of chicken for my large salad what cost a whopping $14 and this just makes me down right annoyed. Why are you skimping on the ingredients just because I requested for 1 small thing to be removed? So in a nutshell I ended up paying for a few pieces of lousy lettuce and 4 paper thin pieces of chicken and still left hungry. To me this is not my idea of a great dining experience and at this point I'm not really sure I'd ever come back. This experience definitely left me feeling like I got ripped off real good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-10?start=120,2.9480000000000004,2.9480000000000004,2.9480000000000004,2.9480000000000004,2.9480000000000004

171,SR H.,"Las Vegas, NV",11,44,2.0,1.0,2015-04-23,"Alright guys... so I've worked in restaurants so I know how hard being a server can be sometimes. However saying that, I've worked with people who are just not cut out to be in the service industry. It's not for everyone. Every restaurant I've worked in as a server, you're expected to know the cocktails and foods that are offered, at minimum. So when it took our server 15 minutes to actually greet us and take our beverage order I thought ordering a margarita was pretty basic. So another 15 minutes when pink drinks were being dropped off at the table I was slightly confused where I was informed that they were the ""platinum margaritas"" that we had ordered. Weird, I remember ordering a margarita and asking what tequila was used (the server couldn't answer that so I said well was fine) but not a platinum margarita. Upon sending it back I noticed on the menu that the platinum was significantly more expensive (which I wouldn't mind paying for, if that was actually what I wanted in the first place) and it came with my choice of chambord or grand marinier in terms of a cadillac margarita. Hmmmm... so instead of asking which we preferred she automatically put in chambord while upselling us without our permission. Shady. Fast forward to 30 minutes and four trips to the table later. I have successfully had to explain to our server what chambord is, what grand marnier is, and what a cadillac margarita is. (They don't teach these things in training?!) The manager had to stop by the table because after the fifth time when the server couldn't get a request right as simple as extra salt on a margarita for my friend, we have just had it. 45 minutes to get a simple margarita order right is completely unacceptable. I'm sorry to say this, but this has to be hands down the worst restaurant experience I've ever had. And I didn't even try the food because the service was so incompetent.

39,James H.,"Las Vegas, NV",258,110,123.0,1.0,2015-06-26,"I really don't like writing a negative review, but sadly this is the second one in a week.  My wife and I went to CPK for a lunchtime meeting with a small group of other parents from our son's school.  After not eating at a sit-down CPK for several years due to a bad experience, history repeated itself at another of their restaurants 2400 miles away. Right after we were seated, our waitress took our drink orders.  She wasn't unpleasant but seemed a little put out that she had to be there.  Everyone's entitled to a bad day and she was doing her job, so it was hard to be critical at this point.  She brought our drinks then disappeared.  Fifty minutes later, and with mostly empty glasses on the table she returned to take our lunch orders, now making faces as if she'd been forced to be there and deal with customers.  At that point, she'd gone from a server I thought was having a bad day but doing her job (gets the benefit of the doubt), to a server who disappeared for almost an hour, then returned seeming even irritated that she had to do her job.  What was equally stunning was during that 50 minute absence, no other members of the waitstaff seemed to notice we weren't being taken care of.  I know they saw us (eye contact) as we kept looking around for our waitress but it seemed as if they either weren't supposed to back her up.  Or they didn't care. With somewhat limited time left for lunch at that point, my wife and I asked our waitress if our food could be rushed, explaining we both needed to leave 30 minutes later.  She said it wouldn't be a problem, so we ordered.  Thirty minutes went by without seeing our waitress again and my wife got up to leave to make her next appointment.  It was just at that time our food started coming out.  I needed to leave as well but remained to asked the waitress to please box our two meals to go, and to bring me the check.  Once again she seemed annoyed that I asked her to do something, and she even looked surprised that after ordering our food to eat there, I apparently decided I wanted it to go instead.  I reminded her we had told her we needed to leave 30 minutes from the time we ordered (and an hour and a half after we were seated).  I paid and was out the door about 10 minutes later.  I've only walked out of a restaurant without paying one time in my life.  This would have been the second time, but I didn't want CPK to stick my bill with our friends. I like the CPK menu the several times I've eaten their food:  in full-service restaurants, in airports and even their frozen pizzas.  Most of this was before I joined Yelp.  Oddly, several years ago in Baltimore, MD, I had the identical experience at a CPK full-service restaurant there.  The management was unconcerned and unapologetic.  That was the last time I ate at a full-service CPK.  This time, the lunch venue was picked by others in the group and I figured I could get over my previous bad experience--maybe it was just a singular event.  I was stunned to see the identical lack of desire to take care of the customer here in Las Vegas:  two restaurants on opposite sides of the country that provided an almost identical experience.  I know there are a lot of CPK fans out there, but for my wife and I, this visit only confirm my original observation that I don't need to dine at a CPK restaurant again, especially when there are so many other wonderful dining options available.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-10?start=80,3.28,3.28,3.28,3.172,3.2800000000000002

Melissa came from behind the bar to take our drink order. We gave her a drink order with an appetizer order. She promised us fresh bread which we never received all night. After she came back to take our dinner order we never saw her again for the whole night. We had to go to the bar & see Jo Jo to get a refill on my diet coke. The food came out, I had the jambalaya fettuccine which was good & my Sister had a salad with chicken added to it. Again no Melissa to be found to even check on the food & ask for refills. Jo Jo finally came out from behind the bar & got us a refill & asked if we were OK. Again no bread. The manager did stop by to ask how the food was I we said good. He was also having a problem at the bar with another customer who's food came out wrong. Melissa took the order on that 1 too & again Jo Jo had to take the complaint & fix the problem. My Sister notice that by the time his recook came out his lady guest was finished with her food. I'm a server & have been in the business for over 30 years & have never seen a server completely disappear & never come back to the table after taking the order.Jo Jo had to take our dessert order & bring us the check. I would never complain in a restaurant because it's not my style & I'm not looking for anything for free. I've been to CPK many times since 1989 when they first opened at the Mirage.

We ordered drinks and appetizers and once they arrived, the waitress left the food on the table and left. Another waiter walking by asked if we needed plates. He returned five minutes later with plates and silverware. Once our food arrived, my daughter and her friend noticed crickets all over the ground and my husband felt a couple on his feet. He got up and asked if we could be moved inside and they said yes. We ended up having to carry our own plates and had to return a second time to get our drinks. No one (waitress, manager) came up to the table to ask of everything was alright or to attempt to apologize for the inconvenience.  Our waitress seemed to give up on our table. She did not return to check and see if we needed anything or wanted to order anything. Our plates sat on the table for ten minutes and we had to get another waitress's attention and ask her to get someone to clear the table. They removed two glasses and did not return for the rest of the dishes. We waited another 5 minutes and the waitress took our desert order. Before leaving, she took a single plate with her. Another waiter brought out the desert and my husband asked if he could remove the dinner plates and silverware from our table.  The original waitress only returned to give us the bill and said ""thanks"" when we paid and that was it. I am not sure why they were slacking tonight. The service was not at all what we have previously experienced and the cricket overflow was disgusting. They should spray the patio at least once a month.

It. was. disgusting. The infamous bbq chopped salad wasn't chopped--it was sliced--and the bbq dressing was altered/tasted artificial. I have eaten this for almost 30 years, and so the difference was instantly recognizable.  Our server seemed equally confused with the new menu when we asked questions about some of the strange combinations.  We attempted three times to make this work by trying various things (two dine in and one take out), but our favorites are gone; the new menu is a big miss for us.

Love that their main course plates have fish choices of mahi mahi, halibut, and salmon :D Chicken and beef I believe are available too.

No problem; my waiter had the kitchen get me a fresh bowl. He even brought me some lime wedges from the bar to squeeze into it. The flavor wasn't bad, but there was a complete lack of filling.

118,Cassie C.,"Las Vegas, NV",33,7,,2.0,2017-02-10,"I want to start off by saying the food was good. Hence why it is 2 stars instead of one.  So here are the problems. 1. The portions are so ridiculously small. We paid about $20 for a small 6 slice pizza that's maybe a foot in diameter at most. We ordered online and online did not say they were that small. There were no size options so I'm guessing all their pizzas are that size. We ordered the potatoes too and that was enough for only one person. We also ordered the avocado chicken rolls. They were actually good. Still small though.  Overall we spent about $72 for a meal that left us still hungry.  2. The customer service was sub par. We ordered delivery on grub hub. Here's the thing. We ordered extra toppings for the pizzas, and got none of them despite being charged. We called them knowing grub hub is not so great at coordinating with the restaurants and these things happen. Usually we just give the restaurants a call, let them know, and they offer to fix the order and send the proper food. We were willing to wait and everything. Here's where the problem is. Instead of offering to give us the correct order, a credit, anything, they just told us to just call grub hub for a refund for the toppings. They didn't even give us an option. We didn't want a refund, we wanted the correct pizzas. We wanted our food. But they just brushed us off and offered no help themselves. Given no choice that's exactly what we did, and called grub hub who was much nicer and more professional.  We didn't yell, we didn't harass, we even laughed on the phone to ease the tension that goes with making a complaint. But we got no help what so ever.  So basically if you've got a bunch of cash to blow for a little bit of good food. Great. I say don't order over grub hub. And if you get your order wrong. Don't bother calling them. They probably won't help you.  We will not be ordering again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-10?start=40,3.64,3.74,3.74,3.0160000000000005,3.7000000000000006

We love the Szechuan dumplings, and the crispy tenderness of the 'traditional' crust they use in their pizzas.  The only problem with getting it delivered at home is that everything is usually lukewarm to slightly cold, and a lot of it has to be zapped in ""Chef Mike"" before we eat.  I wondered if the food was even better if ordered and eaten at the location we usually get it delivered from, so we decided to try them this past weekend. Wonder no more. The food, served fresh at the restaurant, was ASTONISHING. Not a word one usually uses for a chain restaurant, but everything, from the Mexican Street Corn, (they need to serve extra large bowls of that as an option for an entree), to the luscious and decadent Butter Cake for dessert, (NOT a part of the delivery menu!) is so much better, flavor and temperature-wise.  And the staff couldn't have been more attentive or helpful.

42,Stephanie Z.,"Las Vegas, NV",125,9,9.0,4.0,2017-12-20,"Until my experience tonight this was ""our restaurant"". My two kids and I go on ""dates"" and CPK was always our favorite place! Unfortunately as a person of integrity I can't give them my business anymore. I have always tolerated the few things that irk me because my kids were happy and we had fun. My main concern was always that they are a family friendly chain (kid menu, high chairs, crayons, etc.) but the young staff have little to no idea how to serve a table with toddlers. For one you don't put hot pizza plates directly in front of them and it's helpful to remove all plates when we are finished as a table with toddlers needs as little on it as possible. Before you start thinking I'm an entitled mom looking for special accommodations let me explain. My children are held to a very high standard in restaurants. There is no running, throwing, standing on seats, or disturbing other guests, etc. I even clean up the floor before we leave and never tip under 20%.  Tonight was a very special evening we had planned all month: Santa day!! Plus we were going to stay for the parade at 6:00. The line was long for Santa so we decided to eat first although keeping clothes photo clean was going to be tough. We sat down, ordered our drinks and then I took my kids to the bathroom and to wash our hands. When I returned I had a new server who was taking over for the previous as he was leaving. Ok, no problem that's pretty common. The restaurant was not very busy at this time. (4:30 ish) After the usual to be expected struggles (drink that didn't arrive until I asked for it again when the manager brought out our dinner, no plates being removed, no water refill) I was asked, ""are you planning to order anything else because I'm almost done?"" I told her the kids would probably have their ice cream after dinner but that would be all. She said ""ok I'll bring it right out."" I was ok with this  I guess even though they were still snacking on dinner. She came over with the ice cream and the check and within 2 minutes I handed her my card. She boxed up my pizza and brought the slip back. Because I was juggling two toddlers with ice cream and trying to keep them clean and wiping up spills so the bench wouldn't be sticky for the next guest, I didn't sign it right away. About 3 minutes into eating dessert a different girl came by and said ""are you all set with your check?"" I replied, ""she ran it, yes, but I haven't signed yet."" To which she responded, ""well could you? I want her off my clock."" While this may not seem like a big deal, it most certainly is. I was a waitress for 12 years and I can tell you, you don't rush a guest like this. I never would have even approached a table sitting with an unsigned bill until at least 20 minutes had passed and that would be after continuing to check in. I had the unsigned slip for under 5 minutes! Further, we were still eating and drinking. We are your customers until we leave, NOT until you take my money. Aside from rude, it was unprofessional. ""I want her off my clock.""???? Really CPK you already cut my first server and 30 minutes later you are that desperate to cut another that this is how your staff talks to repeat customers?? I took the signed slip to my waitress and told her that I found this approach very rude and that we would not be coming back. She said nothing, nor did she make any attempt to apologize even as I was still at the restaurant for a few minutes putting my kids coats on and getting my daughter in her stroller. She still got her 20% and I cleaned up our table and stacked the dishes, but we will not be coming back. I work too hard for my money to give it to rude people. So I hope you saved your $1.30 by getting that waitress off ""your clock"" and ruining our date.  I asked the bartender on my way out if he knew the name of the front of the house manager that night and thought it was Dina. She didn't seem to fit my description though so in hindsight I'm wondering if the rude girl I thought was a manager was just a fellow waitress ""helping out"" by moving customers along - I'm not sure which is worse. The 3 stars are for the food (quick and tasty) I would like to add that the manager on site that evening, Dina, contacted me after posting my previous bad review. She was FANTASTIC! I feel completely confident that my concerns were addressed with the appropriate staff members and I am happy to say we'll get to go back for more dates!! I know not all employees are going to behave perfectly. All I can ask is to be heard and I feel confident that I was. Thank you, CPK for hiring a dedicated manager",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-10,3.64,3.68,3.68,,3.6640000000000006

There are lots of dining options at Downtown Summerlin, so we didn't even know that there was one here.  The ambiance is really nice (LOVE it), and I love that the windows really light a lot of light into the restaurant. The bathrooms are in the far back of the restaurant, but the communal sink is just outside of the bathrooms- womens is to the left, while mens is to the right, btw. The unique wall of the bathrooms (front face) are colorful with the color blue being the main focal scheme, and appear to be from recycled skateboards. I kept looking at it, in admiration, as our table was not far. We ordered four pizzas (six slices, I think to a pie)- the club one was my favorite, the shrimp scampi was spicy, but just enough, I like it medium, the original BBQ (that was my fave before trying all these other ones), the works- spicy italian sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, mozzarella, red onions, green peppers, olives, and oregano, two appetizers- chorizo queso fundido & flatbread (one was free, *I became a member online recently*), the salad was really delicious- the original BBQ chopped salad, and there were several drinks for part of our party. I could've gotten a dessert but we didn't get it, and it's too late, ah, maybe next time. Anyway, we asked for more chips and we had leftovers.   Our server was really attentive (I'm sorry, I can't recall her name), she was patient with us, as we were talking more than checking out the menu. We were so busy that I didn't take any pictures (darn!), like I usually do! And the pizzas, the apps, and the salad were all so yummy!!! I was impressed, like I said, it's been years (*oops, I'm totally forgetting the three times that I ordered for catering at work- everything was yummy all those times too- but that was from Town Square*), and I am really interested in coming back for some more yummy eats. Everything was great, the food, the ambiance, the service; I am sure we will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-10,3.36,3.61,3.61,,3.5100000000000002
