47,Brandon P.,"Las Vegas, NV",1179,31,188.0,5.0,2016-04-06,This is a great spot for lunch or dinner and could not be a better atmosphere. The outside bar on the elevated patio with a cocktail people watching could not be anymore satisfying.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-12?start=40,3.9880000000000004,3.9880000000000004,3.9880000000000004,3.9880000000000004,3.9880000000000004
32,Daniel F.,"San Jose, CA",28,50,3.0,5.0,2016-04-08,"Spot just opened up a couple of days ago. Was in here late evening with my wife. We heard about the park just opening up and wanted to check it out. This California pizza is in a very nice setting.  The customer service today was spot on. Greeted quickly and sat us quickly. It was slightly busy.  The food we traditionally order was a bit different and did catch us a little off guard but it was great!  We later spoke to a supervisor who asked us how everything was, he did tell us that the menu at this location was different than other California pizzas, he had a fancy name for the menu but I can't remember.  He offered a free dessert and it was delicious!  I am assuming that we could only get this dessert at this location?..it was awesssssome.  I typically never have really big expectations of customer service when we eat out, specially with a big chain restaurant like California pizza. But I was shocked on how  responsive and attentive everyone working was.  Gotta give it up to everyone here. Awesome job!  And by the way our waitress Caresse was great!  I am a Vegas local, and I try real hard to avoid the strip at all cost. But I will definitely make an exception for this California pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-12?start=40,3.9880000000000004,3.9880000000000004,3.9880000000000004,3.9880000000000004,3.9880000000000004
64,Lisa H.,"Las Vegas, NV",28,173,300.0,5.0,2016-04-10,It's been years since I've been to a CPK but wanted to give this location a try. The atmosphere is amazing with plenty of outdoor seating. The menu has multiple items that are unique to this location only including steaks and craft cocktails. They're goal is to use fresh ingredients & cater to Vegas. Not sure if they do this at all locations but they brought us bread with an oil dipping sauce to start our meal. It was pretty good. Kept it pretty simple & had spicy chicken meatballs & chipotle chicken pizza. Meatballs were really good. Pizza was good but nothing special. Service was amazing. Very friendly & attentive.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-12?start=20,3.9240000000000004,3.9240000000000004,3.9240000000000004,3.9240000000000004,3.924000000000001

Which is the only reason I gave it 2 stars. The sangria has VERY little alcohol in it. If you've ever had the displeasure of tasting the sangria at olive garden I think this is the same stuff.

My husband had a glass of wine.  Make sure to specify how many ounces you want otherwise they give you more than requested. The second time we visited, we both had salads, Cobb salad (half size) for me and ceasar salad (full size) for my husband.  Again, both were very filling.

54,Jackie W.,"Santa Monica, CA",141,209,3.0,4.0,2016-06-17,"Our friend told us this CPK has just opened with a bigger menu and some newly reimagined dishes. We wanted an easy spot to get brunch before our long drive back to LA, and this fit the bill. We walked into a massive spot, with mostly empty tables around noon on Sunday. There's outdoor and indoor seating, but with summer temps in Vegas, indoor makes a lot more sense. It's an open-concept kitchen and the inside of the place feels nice and open, but nothing remarkable. Positives +They had a whole menu of some non-alcoholic cocktails for $3. That price is spectacular! +Our friend got the sangria flight (generous servings), which was also well-priced, and each one looked truly unique.  +Menu is big and well-marked (vegetarian), etc. There's something for everyone. +Service was excellent. Our water was attentive, friendly and very funny. Water and drinks were consistently refilled. +Water is served with a lemon automatically - it's the little things! +Pizza is extremely thin crust and has LOTS of veggies on the veggie pizza. This shouldn't be a surprise, but many places skimp. +It only costs $1 to add an egg to a pizza. +Roasted veggie salad had a good variety of veggies (artichokes, sundried tomatoes, olives, etc.). Negative is there was still A LOT of lettuce. Negatives -Guacamole was VERY small and more like a bit of diced avocado. -It's still CPK. The menu, while seeming a bit bigger than other CPKs, was still pretty standard CPK. We left full and satisfied, but it is still a chain. -Location is a bit remote in terms of other things on the strip. You need to seek this out a bit more. -Parking situation, while not hard, does cost money and is a slight walk.

I arrived, was seated and waited on promptly. I ordered the gauc and chips appetizer to start. I've had this before so I thought I knew what to expect. Well they use frozen corn, which is absolutely fine but among your gauc bites you get freezer cold bites of corn. Haven't had it served to me that way before.  Then I ordered what I really came for, the garlic cream fettuccine. Unfortunately this was also not prepared the way I had expected. There wasn't much of a cream to the sauce at all that the pasta was even sticking to its self while hot. The garlic flavor was very subtle and the sauce itself didn't offer much taste. Regardless I had left overs so I took it to go and needless to say it was impossible to take out of the to go box to heat up because it was all brick solid.  I did enjoy my drink - strawberry mango cooler, the strong taste of ginger offered quite the kick. I also enjoyed the ambiance. They have a large patio section and equally large interior.

It took a few minutes for someone to realize we were waiting to be seated, but from that point forward service was on point.  We decided to share 2 apps (crispy potatoes as well as the chips with guac) and a wild mushroom pizza. The crispy potatoes were served with a delicious red chimichurri sauce, the chips with guac were tasty but the serving size was woefully small for the price (even on the strip). The pizza was delicious, get the white truffle oil to drizzle on top.  We had limited time to eat, and while we never expressed this to our server, we were able to get in and out in a rather short amount of time, which meant we did not miss any of the event we were attending.

Well, there was no lime in my drink and even tho it can be refilled, I was never offered a refill of my drink. When I order my pizza the bar tender asked me if I prefer my pizza original, hand tossed or thin crust?  I order thin crust. Next mistake! Pizza arrived lukewarm and sitting in the spot at the bar with the 45'F wind coming from the outside, it didn't make the pizza stay warm for 1 minute. So I finished my last ice cold bite of the pizza and ordered the check, when, to my surprise, there was an up charge of 1.50$ for ""thin crust"". When I asked the bar tender why he did not explain to me that there is an up charge for thin crust, he slick just told me that this are just suggestions and they are told NOT to mention up charges to the guests.  If I would just up charge my clients in my job without telling them, I would loose my job. I gave 1 star because the bar tender took the charge off the check, after he told me he would do it because it seems to upset me. Otherwise I would have gave 0 stars...  I'll eat my pizza somewhere else!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-12,3.84,3.84,3.84,,3.84
