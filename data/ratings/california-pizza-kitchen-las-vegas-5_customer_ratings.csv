27,Kayla W.,"Las Vegas, NV",79,151,100.0,4.0,2012-01-27,"California pizza kitchen is wonderful! So many different kinds of pizza, dishes, drinks (fabulous wine), and great staff. This one is pretty fast compared to other one's I have been to. Good job you all! :) My favorite pizza so far is the tostada pizza. Black beans, lime chicken(if you ask for it), tortilla strips, lettuce, and instead of tomato sauce you get a yummy ranch type sauce and it all is so good!!  My favorite drink there is the red sangria. It is just right! This place puts lemon and lime in it and other places put an apple and orange in it, but either way it tickles the taste buds!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-5,3.44,3.44,3.44,3.44,3.4400000000000004
39,Napa S.,"Las Vegas, NV",31,15,8.0,5.0,2012-02-05,"I come to this place all the time.  My favorite is peach iced tea and I always order the wild mushroom pizza and Caesar salad with grilled shrimp.  I love the location because it is surrounding by wonderful shopping (at Town Center).  What better way to end a fun shopping day with friends?  The peach tea here has the best aroma.  Its the best I've ever had.  Just recently they added new items to their menu.  I strongly recommend the Habanero Carnitas Pizza.  It has slow-roasted pulled pork, red onions, cilantro pesto, mozzarella, and queso quasadilla cheese, with spicy habenaro salsa.  Its quickly becoming my new favorite.  I suggest you be careful with the sauce its super spicy.  That's it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-5,3.76,3.76,3.76,,3.76
21,Emily R.,"Las Vegas, NV",1774,1649,10847.0,4.0,2012-04-02,"I had a gift card to CPK that was burning a hole in my pocket so we headed here for lunch. I've always have good experiences at this particular location. Service is extremely friendly and efficient. This is usually my deciding factor in how I review chain restaurants typically. The food is usually pretty standard but the service is what makes or breaks it for me. This place has the good in the service area.  The food, like I said, is pretty standard CPK faire. My favorites, and I usually stick to them when ordering, are the pear and gorgonzola pizza, bbq chicken salad and the veggie pizza. They have a small bites menu that I usually can't resist either. We went with the Korean tacos this time and they had a great punch of flavor and texture, so we'll be ordering those again next time we stop in.  All in all, this location is great and extremely convenient when you're in Town Square.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-5,3.76,3.76,3.76,,3.76

23,Regina C.,"Henderson, NV",303,548,146.0,4.0,2012-10-14,"Ok, I am one to steer clear from chained restaurant...but hear me out. Twas a Friday and although I brought a delicious paleo lunch (salmon and veggies) with me to work, I decided to eat out with my co-workers, and that it was going to be my cheat meal.  We decided on CPK.   I started with the mango lemonade.  It said freshly squeezed on the menu, but I was very skeptical about that. It sure was yummy though.  Upon closer inspection of my glass, I noticed the pulp.  Maybe it was freshly squeezed somehow...I had two glasses total.  For my entree, I chose the chicken avocado eggrolls  There were a total of six halves, and they came with a ranch and the chipotle ranch sauce.  Both were creamy and delicious with these eggrolls.  They were very filling.  After two halves, i was satisfied. I also ordered a butter cake to go.  This butter cake taste like BUTTA!  As if it came right out of the Paula Deen's recipe book!  Oh so delicious.   I don't mind to go out for a drink here at CPK because I can keep ordering the yummy mango lemonade (free refills)...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-5,3.88,3.88,3.88,,3.88

29,Danielle R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1212,879,2797.0,3.0,2012-11-07,"OK not as good as last time, I knew it must've been a fluke!  This time we ordered the tapas baked focaccia to tide us over while we waited for our food. It was damn good. We ate them up and waited.  As we waited, our waitress offered free bread to the table next to us. Now this was my biggest gripe last time I was here, so we ordered something, only to find out they give bread away. FML. I got the same pasta [low fat zucchini and shrimp scampi] I had last time, it wasn't nearly as good. Apparently, must've been different chefs?  Shrimp came with the tails on it....drives me nuts and the tails/shell was soggie/soft, gross. Friend got a pizza and she ate it right up. Took a long time, again. Was almost 1.5 hours before we got out of there, so it's not good for a work lunch if all you get is an hour.  Last time they had some pretty cool music, this time not so much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-5,3.92,3.92,3.92,,3.92
24,May A.,"Roseville, CA",719,940,14068.0,4.0,2012-12-25,"International menu! We have one of these CPK's in Roseville but my first taste had to be in Las Vegas... hmm, to my delight the menu catered to many different taste buds! I thought that they only specialize in pizzas, silly me! Dined here with friends and everything was pleasant. Service was great! Fast even though the restaurant was packed by lunch time on a weekend!), location is just further south of the Strip and there is a parking garage in case side streets are full. One can compare this Las Vegas location to that of The Fountains in Roseville (less the parking garage).  I had the Carnitas Tacos (slow-roasted pork topped with housemade avocado salsa verde, red onions and cilantro)...  the meal came with two tacos, it was yummy but I could only finish one only because we had ordered the dim sum for appetizer, it's actually the Sesame Ginger Chicken Dumplings (Chinese dumplings topped with sesame seeds and green onions. Served with our soy-ginger chili sauce) mmmmmm!!!  The menu also came with a nutritional guide for those who are watching their calorie intake. Overall, very nice experience.

8,Lauren G.,"Sacramento, CA",15,274,26.0,3.0,2013-01-30,"Food was decent. Service was terrible! The food was alright nothing too special. I have had pizza and salad and appetizers from here. Nothing has been mind blowing.  Where I have a problem was our server. She was terrible. She gave attitude when I ordered a water only. I had my kid with me. this means I will tip you extra because kids are a hassle. She got 8% for a tip. She took 22 minutes from the time she gave us menus to the time she got our order! 22 minutes!  I asked if they put raw egg in the Caesar dressing. She said ""well of course they put raw egg in it.""  It isn't well of course. I asked because it wasn't obvious. I then ordered an appetizer for my meal because I didn't want to wait another 20+ minutes for her to return. My meal was fine. Everyone else's meal was fine. The server asked me if I wanted to try a different drink besides water. When I'm more than halfway through my meal probably not. She was rude and hopefully I don't get her again.  Yes, I do remember her name but I don't want to put it on here. My meal was $11 plus tax so I gave her a dollar. Normally I would have given her at least $3.50, since my kid was there, but she didnt deserve the dollar I gave her.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-5?start=20,3.92,3.92,3.92,,3.92

33,Mandi L.,"Las Vegas, NV",415,342,195.0,4.0,2013-02-14,"This location gets super busy for lunch.  Stay at home mom's galore with their giant strollers!  Even if it's really busy, you usually don't wait for longer than 10 minutes.  They also have bar seating, which is usually empty.  The service is hit or miss.  This is a common lunch spot for my coworkers and I so we go here a lot.  Sometimes the service is fast, and sometimes it's slower than watching paint dry.   The food usually comes out in a reasonable time, so that's not what I'm talking about when I say slow.  What I mean is that the server will forget to refill your drinks, or will take forever to bring you your check, or take forever to bring you back your check to sign.   The food overall is good.  I've never had anything here I didn't like, but it's not spectacular or anything.  It's a great little lunch spot and other than the occasional slow service, there are no complaints.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-5,3.84,3.84,3.84,,3.84

22,Jessie B.,"Henderson, NV",75,776,124.0,4.0,2013-03-28,"Can I be a fan of California Pizza Kitchen, if I have never actually tried the pizza? I thought it over, and yes, yes I can. CPK may or may not do pizza well, but they definitely can put together a delicious salad!  I had gotten salads to go from this location a few times, but I have only eaten in one time... It was a beautiful spring day, so my lunch companion and I decided to sit on the patio. Sometimes service on patios can be spotty, I am happy to report that was not the case for us. Drinks were refilled in a timely manner, multiple members of staff stopped by to make sure we had everything we needed.  The caramelized peach salad is what we decided to share. I love that CPK offers the option of a full or half sized salad, the full with chicken added was plenty for us two. The cranberries, Gorgonzola cheese and walnuts were perfect compliments to the delicious peaches. To drink we each had flavored lemonades. The lemonade is fresh-squeezed, the fruit flavoring comes from a syrup though. Still refreshing and yummy, but worth mentioning.  Total damage was around $25. Not bad for a yummy and fairly healthy meal!! I will definitely be back, perhaps I will even try a pizza someday!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-5,3.84,3.84,3.84,,3.84

Knocked off a couple stars this time because service was pretty forgettable. And my pizza had a good amount of leftover flour on the underside, which made for an odd dining experience. I personally don't like the taste of raw flour, but perhaps they are starting a new trend? Shrugs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-5,3.92,3.92,3.92,,3.92
20,Linda S.,"Henderson, NV",1687,192,645.0,4.0,2013-04-15,"CPK is always a winner. I have never had a bad meal here. This Town Square location can get pretty crazy around high feeding time....be careful if you sit in their waiting area as the pony walls are designed for you to bang you head on when you lean back...ouch! You can expect such a successful franchise as this to have their system down which they do. Upon seating, we are greeted immediately with drink order requests. I love the mango iced tea and my wife enjoys the cranberry cooler...a drink she would order before they put it on the menu...cranberry juice, club soda and limes...all with free refills :) You now have to ask for bread as it is not automatically served. Salad, pizza or pasta? That is the question to ask when browsing the menu. Ok 3 words...Kung Pao Spaghetti...whaaat?! I love this dish and surprised other venues haven't copied it yet. Spicy, dark kung pao sauce tossed with spaghetti, green onions, peanuts and dried red peppers. CPK does Kung Pao spaghetti better than most Chinese restaurants do Kung Pao chicken. The bolognese is also very good and better than what I've tried at most Italian restaurants. The fusili with this meat sauce is all my daughter will order. Their thin crust margharita pizza is also another fave. Thin crispy crust with Italian tomatos, fresh mozzarella and basil...simple yet good. Their signature BBQ chicken pizza is also good with carmelized onion and sweet bbq sauce. Their salads are the best and usually the half portion is plenty for one. I like their Caesar salad with salmon pieces for lunch...quick and healthy. They also offer a small cravings menu that has things like a wedge salad, fresh iceberg lettuce wedge, blue cheese dressing (try it with their ranch dressing), bacon bits and chopped egg. The avocado corn dip with tortilla chips is great for sharing. Their latest special offered is the quinoa salad...a great choice for the vegetarian in your group and fills you up.  Whatever you order, CPK has found a way to make it, maybe not in the very best way but in a way that you will like it and come back for more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-5,3.92,3.92,3.92,,3.92
