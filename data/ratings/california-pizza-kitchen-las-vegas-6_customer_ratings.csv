So even though I haven't been to a ton of CPK's, I feel like I know the place pretty well. And this one is probably one of the the worst ones. As the other reviewers have said, service here is crazy slow - not necessarily the service staff's fault - this is a busy CPK, for sure. But my was it bad. I ordered the BBQ chicken salad, dressing on the side. My friends got their food, finished it, and yet my salad still never arrived. I tried to flag down the waitress (took a while), and asked her about my salad. Next time she appeared, it was 10 or 15 minutes later, with the salad. Though the lettuce was drowning in dressing (not exactly dressing on the side, eh). The service was so bad and so slow, I didn't want to send it back because I'd probably miss my flight by the time my food made its way back to me.

A Waffle House would be an upgrade! Yeah, it's that bad. Most airport food options suck, but this place is at the top of my airport suck list! Service that is as slow as a tree sloth. Really, don't bother unless you have at least an hour to kill before boarding time. The other week when I was waiting for my flight and had 45 minutes it still was not enough time to eat here, and I had taken a seat at the bar thinking it would be quicker. Um, nope!  Even at the bar the service was slow, and I had to end up getting the bbq chicken salad I ordered to go so I could catch my flight. Good thing I looked in the bag because they gave me the wrong meal on top of that. I had to wave someone down to quickly give me the right meal and I ran to my gate barely making the plane. Ate on the plane and the salad was barely passable. As far as a California Pizza Kitchen goes there is not that much healthy here to eat, and a salad is the closet thing on the menu.

In the summer of 2011 I was looking for breakfast before my flight back to RDU. Maybe they should do breakfast instead of pizza because my Denver omelet (minus the onions) hit the spot for sure.

Maybe I made a hasty decision based on the lack of other attractive food choices at the Las Vegas airport,  but I completely regretted my overpriced, forgettable experience here. Terrible food AND service.  Cobb Salad was smaller than other locations and was missing eggs and cheese even though the description on the menu included the ingredients. We were going to say something, but the waitress didn't come back for another 10 minutes so we just said ""forget it"" and ate it. The only thing good about the salad was the interesting, asymmetric bowl it came in.  Pizzas were amateur and just whatever. We got the Hawaiian and Sicilian pizzas. Nothing special. I'm paying $13 for a small pizza that fits on a normal sized plate, with basically 1 piece of a bacon and 1 piece of pineapple per slice? You've got to be kidding me.  You'd think service would be faster considering people have places to go, but no. We sat around for another 10 minutes waiting to pay the bill after they brought us the check and we finally just got up and brought it to them because we hit our boarding time.

The menu is different and the food is different. I got the Hawaiian pizza and I'm pretty sure it was not only smaller but used different ingredients and/or different preparation as well. It just didn't taste the same as what I've had at CPK before. Second, service is awful and I'm concerned about hygiene and food safety issues. My coworker avoids dairy products due to allergies so asked for one of the salads minus the mayo. The salad came out with mayo anyway, which my coworker found out after poking at the salad with her fork. When we notified the waiter, he at first acted like there wasn't mayo on it; my coworker again poked at the salad with her fork to show the waiter the mayo, and the waiter had a huge attitude about it and let out an exasperated sigh before taking the dish away. The waiter checked something in the system and no more than 30 seconds after he'd removed the salad from our table, delivered it to another table! I couldn't believe it. It's bad enough that the restaurant would redeliver a dish that the waiter had already put out on another table, but to actually redeliver one that he had seen my friend use her fork in! My friend hadn't actually eaten any of the salad or ever put the fork in her mouth - but the waiter sure didn't know that! I flagged down another waiter to complain to a manager, but none came before we had to leave to go catch our delayed flight. I don't know if the waiter just ignored us or the management just doesn't care. Based on my experience here though, I'd have to wager it's the latter.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-6?start=60,2.04,2.04,2.04,1.924,2.04

I ordered what I usually get from CPK, the Hawaiian BBQ Chicken Pizza. When it came out, first thing I noticed was the size. It's a little smaller than it usually is. Sure, it wasn't a big deal and to be honest, it was probably a good thing since I couldn't take leftovers with me, but I thought it was odd.

My family and I were on our way back to Honolulu from our weekend trip to Vegas.  We frequent Vegas a few times a year so we've always noticed this CPK in the Las Vegas McCarran Airport but didn't actually patronize it until that weekend.  We're actually more of a Chili's family which was right around the corner, about 5 or so gates down.  But upon our check-in with the Chili's hostess, were told it would be at least a 20-minute wait.  So CPK here we came. LOCATION:  conveniently located at the top of the escalators in Terminal 3 across from Ruby's Diner and Pandora. SERVICE:  extremely lacking.  Although we were seated almost immediately, it took a half an our for our waitress to bring us our drinks and I never received the sweetener I asked for to use in my iced tea.  I eventually gave up and got some from a different table.  Our waitress never noticed nor did she address the fact that she had forgotten.  Now, keep in mind, the restaurant was not very busy when we first got seated.  Business did pick up, but not soon enough to constitute such slow service.  It took over an hour to get our food - so long that we almost got it to-go because we were about to have to start boarding.  Our waitress kept apologizing and giving the excuse that they were busy.  And?  Don't most restaurants yearn for that?  And in a high-traffic airport. FOOD:  a little dfiferent from your stand-alone CPKs.  The menu has far less items and, in my case, different food items altogether.  At typical CPKs, I order the creamy alfredo, add chicken and broccolini.  Nowhere on the menu.  I did find, however, garlic cream chicken penne which was actually very tasty.  The rest of my table enjoyed their food as well, you know, once we finally got it.  In my opinion, the taste of the food is what gave this review an extra star. PRICE:eh, what you'd expect from a CPK in an airport. Bottom line, if you're not in a hurry and want something you're used to, by all means, stop here.

For a chain I usually don't mind CPK, it's well known so the food should be fairly consistent.  This one though, was lacking in the food department.  Perhaps the airport environment messes with the quality a bit?  I dunno. The food overall wasn't bad, but it was definitely lackluster.  Just not the quality I was expecting for a CPK.  Not only were the portions smaller than I'm used to from them, our salad & pizzas were barely on the OK meter.  Not as fresh as they could be being that it is CPK! We ended up having: *California Cobb Salad - applewood smoked bacon, avocado, chicken, tomatoes, chopped egg, basil & Gorgonzola with house herb ranch dressing *Thai Chicken Pizza - grilled chicken breast with peanut sauce topped with crisp bean sprouts, carrots & scallions *Mushroom Pepperoni Sausage Pizza - cremini mushrooms, pepperoni, spicy Italian sausage, fresh basil, Mozzarella & Greek oregano Did I already say the serving sizes were on the small side?  I was wondering why the pricing at this particular CPK was a smidge cheaper than a full-sized CPK restaurant.  And did I get my answer!  The salad definitely came in a smaller bowl, and our pizzas definitely looked near an inch smaller in diameter than normal for CPK.  And we were hungry! Our California Cobb Salad was barely shareable for 3 of us.  It was OK but the lettuce just wasn't as crisp & cool as it could be.  My guess is that it sit under a heat lamp for a bit?  Was soggy in a few parts.  The bacon wasn't as crispy as I like it as well. The pizzas were just OK too, the serving size was just not what I normally expect.  This is akin to more of a personal pan pizza size, at least in my opinion.  The toppings were sparse on our Thai Chicken Pizza as well, very little chicken and too much crust.  Crust is good, but give me more toppings please! Not a bad lunch at McCarran's CPK, but you can for sure see its shortcomings as a restaurant.  Service was pretty good, our waiter did leave us hanging though for a while when we were looking for drink refills.  Other than that it was par for the course.

Waited 15 minutes on the patio portion of the restaurant only to have a waitress stand 50 feet away in another room, shake her head at us, and walk away without saying anything to our table of 3. All we wanted to do was sit out on the patio while we ate so we could watch the planes takeoff and land. We decided to walk up to the front of the restaurant again, but to only be scolded at by the same waitress. We kindly told her that we didn't understand the head shake she gave us earlier, but big mistake - she responded by saying ""if people would get up and talk to me I could tell them!"" and went on about how understaffed they were, that we were being impatient, and (the cherry on top) ""do you want to sit down or not?!"". We finally get seated inside and received our water 30 minutes later. I will give this other waitress credit though - all of the other bartenders/waitresses/waiters were sitting at the bar on their phones. Another 20 minutes went by and one of my friends had to leave to catch his flight. Another 20 minutes after that, we were finally able to order. After we ordered our pizza, the waitress came back out and said that they are not making that pizza anymore (even though it was labeled as a CPK favorite?) so we had to choose another one. Fast forward another 20 minutes and our pizza finally comes out. It took a whopping hour and a half (at the very least) to get one mediocre pizza and water for two people.
