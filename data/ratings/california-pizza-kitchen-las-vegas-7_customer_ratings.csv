The line looked long, but we were seated in like 10 mins. We got seated at the bar and our bartender/waiter was named James/Jim. He was great. He seemed serious, but he was super nice and funny!  The only thing that I did not like was that I was sitting at the edge of the bar next to where the waiters pick up the food. Sitting there I can hear all the problems and arguments between the waiters  and chef waiting for the food. But now I see that it is difficult to be a waiter when your ass is on the line and your co workers are being slow or getting the orders wrong.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-7?start=120,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.6719999999999997,3.0000000000000004

My fav is the Thai Chicken Pizza and I'm a huge fan of Fettucini Alfredo and Caesar Salads and I never stray from the fav's so one of these items will be on my order.  Nice place to take the kids too especially this location (Inside the Mirage) so you can combine it with the Secret Garden outing.

I especially love this location in the Mirage because of course Mirage is my favourite hotel when I go to Vegas.  They have a mind blowing menu with something for everyone but I am stickler for what I like and I don't stray too far away from it. In fact I never stray away from it. I make it a point to go twice everytime I go to Vegas cuz the first night I just have to have the traditional Bbq chicken pizza. This is the pizza that put them on the map. So good especially if you love chunks of chicken, bbq sauce, cilantro, red onion and lots of cheese. Yummy! The second night I have to have their Kung Pao spaghetti. Absolutely amazing. It is spicy I must warn you but well worth it. A must try if you never have. It is so good I bought the CPK cookbook and the recipe for Kung Pao spaghetti is in there so one day I intend on giving it a try myself.

The majority of my friends who I was with in Vegas  with apparently have no taste buds. Appetizer: Compared to the other entrees, the lettuce wraps were pretty good. However, as a standalone plate, it was nothing special. Anything will taste pretty bomb compared to the pizzas and pastas that I mentioned below. Pastas: I tried about 3 different pastas from our group and they were ALL sooo dang bland! You can make better pasta by heating up some Prego and boiling some noodles at home. Definitely NOT worth even considering them.  Pizzas: The bread was crusty...

Definitely a lackluster experience, despite being a popular chain in my hometown. I had the fettuccine alfredo with chicken, since it's always a safe bet. The alfredo sauce was bland and the chicken tasted like it was frozen - dry, chewy, and tasteless. Granted, I'm the kind of woman that prefers chicken breast meat over dark meat, but the chicken was beyond dry! I didn't have much before my stomach started acting up. If you even have a remotely weak stomach like me, as greasy foods make my stomach churn, you know that the first jab of pain signals a LONG bathroom visit. Halfway through the meal I told my partner that I had to leave and scrammed to the nearest bathroom, which, by the way, was quite far since casino bathrooms are often at opposite ends. Three bathroom trips later, while still hugging my stomach, I am reminded of why I often stick to salads at such places. Service-wise, seating is fast and the waitress checked on us quite often.

This CPK has never disappointed; it's right off the casino so you can engage in some fun people watching while you're devouring your pizza or whatever else you ordered.

The main reason I am giving this 3 stars is because of the service or lack of decent service inside the Mirage.  As always, CPK is good and I havent had a bad pizza yet. On this visit, I had the Jerk Pizza without onions and peppers, and it was great. Price was a little high, but again it was in the Mirage. Everyone else was satisfied with the food. The server ended up getting on pizza wrong brought out a pasta dish. It took about 10 minutes for the pizza to come back out when everyone was close to half way done. There was no half off or other comp for the mistake. The other issue was is that I paid for everyones pizza with my CC, and noticed it seemed high but didnt think anything of it.

Jim looked at her quizzically and asked why.  She replied that we wanted to eat in our room.  He returned with 4 plastic lids from take out containers and asked her if she was ""from the bum jungle, you know, outside?""  She was taken aback and restated that we are guests in the hotel simply wanting to eat upstairs.  He shrugged and walked away. Very upset by this exchange, my daughter spoke to the manager who was very unhelpful, simply saying that ""he is usually very nice"".   Well, understandably that ruined our evening, especially when we found we could have ordered a room service pizza for less, and received all the accompaniments we needed.  I will definitely be forwarding my pictures of the take-out lids/plates given to us for our dining pleasure, but feel you need to be aware of the shoddy customer service provided by your casino restaurant wait staff.  In hindsight, I wish I would have returned the pizza and gone immediately to the Mirage management. Upon our return home I reported it to the CPK offices, who - unlike the CPK #10 floor manager - acted very quickly to try to rectify this experience.  We did receive apologies from The Mirage management as well as 2 ""be our guest"" cards from the CPK.  We appreciate the actions of the CPK offices and the Mirage, however it is very unlikely we will return to the CPK #10 located inside The Mirage.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-7?start=120,3.12,3.12,3.12,2.3760000000000003,3.1200000000000006

Things to expect on thur - sat  1.Wait times are busy its a oddly shaped restaurant so expect a wait 2. Price is a bit pricey for a pizza but I guess that's because it's inside a hotel. 3.Customer Service is the driving factor of this field and sometimes its a little lacking well 2 times I went.  For a P.H. corp restaurant you would expect a little more friendly staff but meh  There are other good pizza joint's on and off the strip  oh and the customer attire various its funny to see highly dressed up people next to shorts and tee shirt people,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-7?start=100,2.72,2.72,2.72,2.732,2.72

Well, it had been years since I had one pizza here but I was at the Mirage at the beginning of a trade show and I was first heding to the Mirage's buffet but with a $45 sticker price, I began to look for alternatives. Alternatives are not plenty here and I stumbled upon this place and though I would give a try for old times sake! My friend and I were not that hungry so I suggested that we share a pizza ""Pear and Gorgonzola"". It was good and one was plenty for both of us as we could not finished it. At $15 for two, it turned out to be a much better deal than the buffet (which would have been $90 for two!).

When I got there I discovered our hotel was also covered under their to-go orders... oh well, we were already there. The hostess was extremely nice & told us we could order at the bar. It only got worse from there... the bartender completely ignored us. I tried to ask if I could order & he acted as if he didn't hear and then walked away. I had to get one of the chefs to take the order. The man working behind the bar was rude, unpleasant & by far the most negative attitude I encountered during my week in Vegas. We were sober so it's not like we were being loud, causing a commotion or asking for anything extraordinary. I can understand getting annoyed with someone causing a scene but we were just trying to find a late dinner. So, one star for good food & one star for the super awesome hostess.

This location is inside the Mirage, in the middle of the casino.  It has an open floor plan, so you can see the casino from the entire restaurant.  The service was great and the food did not disappoint. Our server was friendly, our food and drinks came promptly, and the salad I ordered was prepared well.  We even forgot a pair of sunglasses at our table, and when we returned to claim them, the hostess had kindly held them for us.  But, it is just me or are the prices at this location remarkably higher than other locations??? A half salad that would normally be 10 bucks at other CPKs will run you at least $13 here. Their pizzas, normally around $13, are almost $20 here. WTF.  I know it's on the strip, but what a racket.  Although I was satisfied with my meal, it seemed a bit ridiculous to have to pay more simply because it's on the strip.  So while familiar, I wouldn't necessarily say it's reasonably priced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-7?start=80,2.92,2.92,2.92,2.8280000000000003,2.92

I can't remember what time it was exactly, but we only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table so it wasn't too bad. It was busy when we went, and it seemed like they were pretty much always busy, regardless of the time. We actually had CPK twice. Once, we dined in and the other my boyfriend ordered and brought back to our room for a late night dinner when I didn't feel like getting out of my PJ's. Both times, we got the Garlic Cheese Focaccia as an appetizer and it was pretty dang good. The first time, we got the Tostada Pizza with chicken added and it was actually really good. Really crispy crust and the salsa they put on the side is legit. The second time, we got the Meat Cravers which was just alright. I usually like to have some kind of vegetables on my pizza, and my boyfriend says no way. So I usually have to side with him, as I did in this case. It wasn't terrible, just not my cup of tea. I think this is definitely a legit option if you're staying at the Mirage or someplace close by. The prices aren't terrible, but you have to remember that any restaurant in a hotel is going to be more pricey than those outside the hotels.

There was no line when we first arrived.  There were plenty of booths open, but we got seated in the center of the restaurant... which was really awkward.  I asked to be seated at a booth, and the hostess gave me a dirty look and told me ""I guess, if you want"".  So... I've been a hostess before, and I know to never turn down a guest if there is no reservation for the table.  The server may be double-seated, but it was not busy there, in fact, there were only a few tables there that were even seated and they all had their food, so I think it was manageable.  We waited there for about 10 minutes until someone came to greet us.  And then another 10 to get waters.  When she took our order, I didn't feel like she was extremely friendly.  This might be because it was towards the end of her shift, but I didn't like it.

I'm not a huge fan of this particular location because it's hectic most of the time and that almost guarantees a not so spectacular dining experience but we were in the area and pizza was on our minds. I was pleasantly surprised when we got there at a little after 6 pm, the wait was only about 10 minutes even though the place was abuzz due to the NBA finals. We were seated right in the middle of all the action so excitement was in the air, I didn't even notice that it took them about 15 minutes to take our drink orders. My husband, not a huge basketball fan, decided to entertain himself by timing how long it would take the servers to refill our drinks or take the used appetizer plates although I wished he had done that after we placed our food order because that took at least 45 minutes and I would've wanted to know how long it took exactly. The servers noticed as he was doing it but it didn't really make a difference service wise lol. For appetizer we ordered their Spinach artichoke dip ($13.50) the dip itself was very tasty but it was hard to bypass the chips which were soaked and glistening with oil.  We got 3 kinds of pizza shared amongst 4 adults and 2 kids:  -Thai chicken pizza with grilled chicken, peanut sauce and topped with bean sprouts on thin crust ($19+) -White pizza with 4 kinds of cheeses, sautéed spinach and roasted garlic on hand tossed crust ($17+) -Sicilian pizza with Italian sausage, Capicola ham, Salami also on thin crust ($18+) I was looking forward to eating the butter cake with ice cream for dessert but by the time we finished we were stuffed. I wouldn't be opposed to eating here again because the food is actually tasty but it's not something I would seek out due to the location. Even with the $2-3 mark up because of the casino location, they do offer Vegas locals 20% off the entire bill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-7?start=20,3.28,3.02,3.02,2.732,3.1240000000000006

I am positive it takes more than 5 minutes to cook and assemble a pizza, so it was either pre-made and reheated or we were given some table who walked outs pizza.

No checking if we wanted refills on our drinks or if we were even done or satisfied with our meal.

Makes me sad because I've worked for a CPK for over 9 years now and I'll always come back because of its unique and innovative dishes. Forreals though, the food tastes exactly the same as my own restaurant and gives me the comfort of familiarity while I'm away partying, which is why I even came to eat at a CPK in VEGAS. Service definitely could've been better. The hosts sat my friends and I at a table where it took about five-ish minutes before our server came by to greet us. She informed us that waters were already on its way to us (which was brought to us by a different staff member), didn't make any suggestions from the menu-which is fine, I already knew it like the back of my hand. Server said they'd give us some time and she would return shortly. She took about another 10 minutes to return and we ordered. We didn't get the complimentary bread-I didn't want any but my friends did. Tables that sat around us after got much faster service from our same server with their drinks and bread. Our appetizer Spinach Dip arrived at a timely manner as well as our Waldorf Salad and Spicy Chipotle Pizza. These items were dropped off by another wait staff and they did not ask if we needed anything such as black pepper (for the salad) or parmesan cheese or red chili flakes; we didn't see our server until we were more than half way done with our meal. We finished everything and did not want dessert. We asked for our bill and it took some time for her to bring it to us.

The spinach and artichoke dip that we ordered I believe we got ripped off something wicked on the amount of actual dip.

Sadly, between the spotty/downright slow service and the fact that both items I ordered were just okay, I doubt I'll be eating at CPK anytime soon (I mean, it's a chain, so one must assume all of their food is generally the same). The biggest problem with both the egg rolls and my pizza was that they were downright bland. Price-wise, everything was average for Vegas (the egg rolls were something like $13.50 and the pizza was $17.50) but honestly there *are* places on and around the Strip where you can get better food for the same prices or cheaper.

We spoke to the manager who brought out the new plates to us, however not once did he check in with us to see how everything was. The second plate wasn't much better than the first. The service was sub-par, and management wasn't concerned. My advice is to spend your money elsewhere., it was not worth it - not even an enjoyable dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas-7?start=40,3.4,3.03,3.03,2.308,3.178

The server was ok nothing out of the ordinary, we ordered a Cesar salad to split between my wife and myself along with a pizza. The salads can out first seemed fresh. Then the pizza came out quite a bit latter. It was Luke warm and tasted as if it had sat under a warming light for quite a while. (Old tasting) We each ate one piece, and asked to box it. We latter heated it in a microwave, but could not get past the old taste. Threw it out.

We were never given the complimentary bread when we arrived, so when the manager came out with the pizza we ordered we asked if we could get some of the bread. He very rudely asked if we had requested it from our waitress because apparently ""at this location you have to do a special request for it"". I have been to this location many times before and have never had to ""request it."" But regardless, we then politely asked if we could have some. He was very rude, especially for being a manager, during this time. Couple minutes later, we see waitresses bringing the bread to tables surrounding us. We asked some of the tables if they did a ""special request"" for the bread or if it was just given to them. Shocker...it was just given to them! Not sure why the manager couldn't have just happily brought us the bread, said sorry your waitress forgot I'll be right back with some!, or responded in any sort of professional manner. While the food is good, I'd rather eat somewhere where I feel welcomed.

We barley sat down and she was already asking what we wanted to eat. I ordered plain pasta with grilled chicken and the chicken was hard and chewy. It was like eating a piece of gum. It was honestly the worst chicken I have ever ate. I asked a different lady that works there if the chicken is cooked enough and showed her my plate and she even said that something was wrong with it because it was so hard to cut. My waitress said that it was ""normal"" and that the chef is strict on temperature of food. Well guess what? my mother is a chef and I know what chicken is supposed to taste like and this was definitely not it.  I highly don't recommend this place.

We both ordered cocktails and both thought they were extremely strong. Some people may like being served extra alcohol in their drinks but I could barely taste the mixers.
