121,Lauren T.,"Las Vegas, NV",27,23,9.0,2.0,2012-03-26,"A friend and I went here on a weekday around 4 pm. We sat on the ""patio"" which is inside. The waitress wasn't overly nice or helpful. We ordered  the mini tacos for an appetizer and a BBQ Chicken and apple wood  bacon pizza. We would have ordered another if they would have told us they were small but the waitress didn't bother.  They brought us a pizza missing the bacon. We ate it assuming it was under the cheese but no. They realized they had made a mistake and rather than coming to apologize and getting us the correct pizza the waitress brought us the bill saying that they didn't charge us for the bacon!  So they took off a dollar something.  The food was great but the service sub par.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas?start=160,3.92,3.92,3.92,3.1440000000000006,3.92
103,Angeline R.,"Las Vegas, NV",524,102,39.0,3.0,2012-04-09,"I came here when I was at Fashion Show mall and had a sudden craving for pizza. I did not want to go to the food court and eat Sbarro so I thought, why not CPK? Upon entering the service was very quick. They sat us and took our order right away. We decided to order the Korean BBQ tacos with sweet chili sauce, mushroom pizza, and the works pizza.  Breakdown: The Korean BBQ tacos were the highlight of the meal! The sweet chili sauce perfectly complemented the chunks of meat and greens. The sweet sauce would leave a little kick of spicy after every bite.  The mushroom pizza was average. It satisfied my craving for pizza, but I was not wow-ed by it. Half way through the meal the cheese  wasn't as soft and  had a weird consistency. Half way through the meal I found myself wishing I had tried Grimaldi's next door.  The works pizza definitely was a little bit of everything. It had so many colorful toppings that made it look very appetizing. I was not too big of a fan though, since I don't care for meat on my pizza (veggies all the way!). The experience at California Pizza Kitchen was an okay one. Would I go back?

Now, in Vegas and getting ready to watch a show, I decided to give them a chance and explore myself. I ordered the Roasted Artichoke and Spinach Pizza. My friend ordered the Garlic Creme Fettuccine with Chicken. My pizza was fantastic, I loved it and was happy that we came here instead of some other place around the Mirage. My friend loved her pasta as well.  Warning: Since this CPK is in the Mirage there can be a long line, so come early if you have a show you need to watch and want to catch dinner before it or if you want to get dinner before hitting the clubs or the casinos. The waitress was nice and served me another drink when needed.

151,Kirstie M.,"Las Vegas, NV",215,268,1110.0,4.0,2012-06-13,"I've been a CPK fan ever since I lived in Hong Kong. I remember taking the time off with my family after church to enjoy their garlic cream fettucine which we did again a couple of nights ago. In addition to that, we had an order of their roasted garlic chicken pizza as well as their classic caesar's salad.  Every experience here brings in an aura of nostalgia. The food tasted exactly the same as it did back in Hong Kong around 2008, down to the very last detail. And by that, I mean the food is very flavorful and rich. Mind you, the garlic fettucine tends to get a little oily so with my mom's gallstone concerns, I had to limit the amount she was taking in or else it would cause a stomach upset (bilary cholic is what they call it if memory serves me well)  Aside from that, this is a good place to hang out after a long day of walking around the mall. They're pretty family-oriented too. The table next to us was a family of 3 with a cute little girl and she was given some crayons and coloring sheets for her enjoyment. She doodled her way through dinner and looked like she had a lot of fun. Staff is friendly and you have the choice whether to eat inside or outside - where you could watch people walk by.

166,Ashley L.,"Las Vegas, NV",28,18,22.0,2.0,2012-08-17,"this review is for the california pizza kitchen inside the fashion show mall.   first of all.. out of all the california pizza kitchens i've been to, this one has the worst service.  i work inside of the mall so i consider myself a regular here and bad service is something that i find on most of my visits.  when you first walk in, you'll find the chatty hostesses who will talk to their friends in front of you while you stare at them and wait for them to seat you.  most of the waiters/waitresses will take their sweet ass time to get to you and help you with what you need, especially if what you needed was a refill of your drink.  on one occasion, they charged me the wrong amount to my credit card and i had to drive back to CPK just to get it fixed.  on a second occasion, i came with friends and we paid for the bill in twenty dollar bills.. well you know how you're supposed to get change back right? the waiter took our money and DISAPPEARED.  we sat there waiting for 30 minutes for him to return and no one came around.  since it was late and the rest of the mall was closing, we just gave up and left.  even though i got compensated for it by the manager (she's a real sweetheart) when i came around a second time, i gotta warn you guys to be careful when you're paying for your meal.. whether you pay with cash or card.  anyways, as for everything else, the restaurant is clean, the seats aren't cramped, and the portions are a little below average compared to other CPKs (i guess i expect that when i'm dining at the fashion show mall). the food is standard and consistent.  one thing i really recommend is the garlic cream fettuccine.. like seriously its the only thing i order every time i come.  if you've never had it before, its a nice big plate of noodles with a thick white sauce that fills you up good for 10 dollars.  you can add chicken and mushrooms to it for an extra cost, but i don't.  one plate of noodles can be shared between two people for a meal that won't make you feel bloated despite the heavyness of the sauce.  the spaghetti bolognese is good too if you want something tomato-y.  theres a garlic tomato-y spaghetti that they sell that i don't recommend anyone to eat.. unless they enjoy a mouth full of garlic flavor that super minty gum can't remove. the pesto is not my favorite.  the salads here are on the ehh side. for appetizers, the fried macaroni and cheese (it has a fancier name.. but i forgot it) is delicious! but it's on the small side.  it comes with four pieces (my picture only shows two because i have a bad habit of eating my food and then remembering to take a picture) on a plate with cheesy sauce.  as for the pizzas.. i can't say anything about them.  i don't like pizza ):  overall, the food here is just as good as any other california pizza kitchen but i'd rather go to town square or the mirage because the service would be better there. p.s. when they ask you if you want to sit inside or outside, choose INSIDE! from my experience, the service is faster. oh and ask for free bread.  yum! p.p.s i've recently discovered that you get more food with take out!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-las-vegas?start=140,3.64,3.64,3.64,3.0480000000000005,3.6400000000000006
49,James S.,"Los Angeles, CA",711,1206,475.0,3.0,2012-09-03,"It's a CPK, so it's pretty much what you'd expect from a CPK. And that is: fresh, decent, quick serve restaurant-fare in a sit-down setting. Service was prompt and helpful and friendly. They have a number of new items which seem to push them into the territory of 'more serious' restaurant. And that includes a salmon dish for close to $20. I almost never order salmon out anyway, and that's probably not going to sway me. For a informal business lunch, it works just fine here. The tortilla soup has a bit of bit, and a good deal of flavor. CPK has always been a soup-place for some, and I was happy to dive in myself.  A Cobb salad, I think, is what I had next. Perfectly fine, if not terribly robust. The chunks of turkey/chicken were a presence in the salad, but really didn't stand out. The avocado made itself better known, and that was fine. The shredded Romaine was adequate, if not terribly flavorful.

They really should consider opening a location away from the strip. What I like about CPK is that they are always consistent. I walk in knowing that I will eat good food and leave happy. Here are some of my favorites: -The original BBQ Chicken Pizza: gotta love this classic. Always comes out hot and delicious!  -Spinach Artichoke Dip: I have ordered this dish at many restaurants, but CPK has the best one. Its very smooth, creamy, and easy to dip! -Garlic Cream Fettuccine with Chicken: another classic that I love. The sauce is thick and full of flavor, which is how I like my pastas! -California Club Sandwich: I ordered this a couple of times when I lived in California and I remember it being surprisingly good. I think the herb cheese focaccia bread was very tasty. -Avocado Club Egg Rolls: I have never tried this, but my husband loves them. One dish you might want to stay away from is the Crispy Mac N' Cheese. We ordered it when the new small plates menu came out. It sounded interesting because they use Panko, but it was very cold and the cheese was flavorless.  Service has always been pretty good and attentive.

My sister's dish, I think she ordered a sandwich or something, but her's was delicious.

Their flatbreads are a good value for two people. However, I wouldn't order the fish tacos again.

So hour or less then tentative server decided to say that we didn't order it, which was a lie. So we had to wait, yet again for a third pizza which was different.

We usually always get the BBQ Chicken Pizza, but decided to try something different. We went with the Thai Chicken Pizza! And it was a good choice. Could have used a little more chicken though.

I have been visiting this location for years and it is definitely my favorite location. The manager, Jamie, is the sweetest thing since butter cake (if you haven't tried it, PLEASE TRY IT NOW!) I usually come to this location to stop by and visit some old friends, Casey, one of the best servers I have ever had in any dining establishment. (*Quick story*We met Casey at his old restaurant Sammy's Woodfired Pizza and one day stumbled across him serving at CPK at Fashion Show. It's a good thing because the quality of the food at Sammy's has gone down, and the quality of service/food/overall dining at CPK has gone up!) I like to credit some of that to the amazing server, Casey, that always knows how to have a party! That guy always asks about our kids, how we are doing, how life is going, and how the food is tasting!  Jamie, his boss, is the coolest gal around! Casey ran to his boss and introduced us to her, gave her the whole story how we basically stalked him, and now we run into him 2x/month. She is always so excited to see us come in, which makes each visit worth while. I absolutely love being welcomed with open arms, makes this place feel like a home away from home. As for the food, the little bite are always a good treat before the meal. I usually indulge in the mac n cheese bites, or the flat breads, because they're usually really delicious! I also go for the seasonal salad, it's like watermelon with feta, to die for!!  The pizzas are always good, but there's something about the pastas here that keeps me coming back.

No reason to rush or be inappropriate, did not ask how wer doing I had to ask another server to give us napkins, extra sauce and small spoon!! and we have little kids! It was my birthday so I think my husband asked him to bring in cake with candle so me and the kids can blow it, not looking for free dessert coz we are stuffed on how much food we ordered! he just left the cake and lit it up and said ""here u go"" who does that! Usually the staff sings with ur family and wish u a happy bday! I mean that's what I see everytime somebody has a birthday to celebrate at the restaurant! Talked to Kelli manager, she was offering something to make it better! We refused! We have money to eat.

I love CPK mostly, ironically, for its salads, although its pizzas are fine, but the salads are of great variety, always fresh, and always welcome. Moroccan-spiced chicken has long been a favorite. The avocado egg rolls are also a classic they do quite well. The menu here is the standard CPK the world over...but come here to put your feet up and get some VIP treatment after a long day or shopping or trekking the Strip.  This particular CPK has a wonderful staff, in particular the assistant GM, Jamie, who went above and beyond to ensure a quality crew meal for my large party on our work break recently. We called ahead to have food ready for us since we were on a tight schedule and everything was served correctly and fresh. Jamie made fresh coffees and served our every miniscule whim and request, boxing leftovers up herself, running pitchers of water back and forth, and completely winning us over with the ""life-changing"" dessert: warm brown butter cake with vanilla bean ice cream and whipped cream. AN ABSOLUTE MUST-ORDER! The seating here is open to the mall (not in the food court) but comfortable and not exceedingly loud. Very clean. Highly recommended.
