16,Beth B.,"Overland Park, KS",138,286,18.0,3.0,2012-05-31,"i came here for lunch today with 2 coworkers. I was not in the mood for pizza - as I had just had Shakespeare's from CoMo (best pizza in the world) earlier in the week. Plus, their pizzas were $11 and $12 which seemed kind of pricey to me.  I asked the server what salads he recommended and he said the BBQ chicken and Crispy Thai salads were the most popular. I had the Crispy Thai salad (1/2 order) for about $9.50. It was really good. It was just a bit more than I could finish. The salad had pieces of chicken and edamame and was really good. It has a Thai peanut sauce and lime-cilantro combo dressing which keeps the peanut sauce from being so thick and overwhelming. Once again, seemed a bit pricey, but the food was excellent. My coworkers ordered a pepperoni pizza and a fried club appetizer. Neither looked all that good to me, but to each their own. Our server was great. He came to our table shortly after we sat down, took our drink and food order at the same time, promptly brought out our drinks and made sure our drinks were never empty. It took a little while to get our food, but it was nothing crazy. We were in and out within an hour.  I would definitely come back for that salad. Not sure I would come for pizza.

103,J. Geoff S.,"Kansas City, United States",17,38,3.0,5.0,2014-01-11,"This review is about this location and the company over all over more than a year of experiences with them. My first visit was on a whim.  I ordered the roasted veggie sandwich but was put off by the lack of a vegetarian option to go with the sandwich (Cesar salad is not vegetarian.)  I asked the waitress to sub the roasted veggie salad, she said she'd check on it, and let me know.  She ends up bringing me the sandwich with the salad.  I thought it was all very good.  She was super friendly, and the friend I was with even thought she was great and was impressed with her service. But they ended up charging me for the salad by mistake, forgetting I asked to sub it.  No problem, they comped it off, all was well, first world crisis averted. I took to CPK's Facebook page, not out of anger over the situation, but to suggest they do something about their menu options with sides for the sandwiches.  For a place that touts they cater to both vegetarians and vegans, they really need to find a vegetarian side to go with the sandwich. They not only apologized by they went above and beyond what I expected and gave me a $40.00 gift certificate! I used the gift certificate once after getting it, and that was on the roasted veggie salad.  I tucked the gift certificate away until my family came for a visit, we went there on a Saturday afternoon, I gave the waiter my gift certificate, but then he came back and said there was nothing on there.  The only thing it had been used for was on the price of one roasted veggie salad, this was impossible.  But it was my word against theirs.  I had no proof of use of what I used it for, I was totally at their mercy. We wait there for quite some time while they try to contact somebody at the corporate office, but they couldn't get anybody on the weekend.   The manager ends up honoring it for what I estimated was left on the certificate, which was around $26.00.  She said they would contact me if they had any problems with using the certificate after they contacted corporate on Saturday.  The food here is over all solid.  Not every meal I've had pops for me, they still need to develop some decent side options to the sandwiches, but it's a pizza place first and foremost, I get it sandwich and a good side isn't their driving factor.  The food: Four stars at best.  Yes, I am a fan.  Management and staff have always been excellent when I have gone here, about as good as it gets!  WOOHOO!  FIVE STARS! Ignore the haters, this place may not have the best food in Kansas City, but you get a solid meal for your money, and they treat you well.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-leawood,3.08,3.08,3.08,3.2520000000000002,3.0800000000000005

9,Christina A.,"Louisburg, KS",0,8,,2.0,2014-05-17,"I'll sum up our experience in two words: NEVER AGAIN. Now the specifics: We arrived at Park Place with intention of eating at BurgerFi. When we got there, it was super crowded, and no tables were available. My husband is disabled, so the two of us and our 10 year old daughter opted to give CPK a try, since standing and eating while we waited for a table to open up isn't a possibility.  We were seated promptly, which was nice. The decor was typical for a mid-range casual dining restaurant, and it was clean. Our server arrived with a trainee, took our drink orders, and asked if we had been there before. We said no, but that kind of went ignored. The server exuded apathy, and didn't offer any suggestions or ask if we were interested in an appetizer. It was pretty obvious he just didn't want to be there. He did explain that all of the pizzas were the same size, 10 inches.  Looking at the menu, the pizza choices seemed like they would be good, and we opted to have the BBQ chicken pizza on hand tossed crust, and the Meat Cravers thin crust pizza.

64,Christina A.,"Louisburg, United States",0,8,,2.0,2014-05-17,"I'll sum up our experience in two words: NEVER AGAIN. Now the specifics: We arrived at Park Place with intention of eating at BurgerFi. When we got there, it was super crowded, and no tables were available. My husband is disabled, so the two of us and our 10 year old daughter opted to give CPK a try, since standing and eating while we waited for a table to open up isn't a possibility.  We were seated promptly, which was nice. The decor was typical for a mid-range casual dining restaurant, and it was clean. Our server arrived with a trainee, took our drink orders, and asked if we had been there before. We said no, but that kind of went ignored. The server exuded apathy, and didn't offer any suggestions or ask if we were interested in an appetizer. It was pretty obvious he just didn't want to be there. He did explain that all of the pizzas were the same size, 10 inches.  Looking at the menu, the pizza choices seemed like they would be good, and we opted to have the BBQ chicken pizza on hand tossed crust, and the Meat Cravers thin crust pizza. As we waited we were brought a small plate of bread with olive oil and herbs for dipping. It was okay.  Then, the pizza arrived.  INCREDIBLY disappointed.

48,J. Geoff S.,"Kansas City, MO",17,38,3.0,5.0,2014-11-01,"This review is about this location and the company over all over more than a year of experiences with them. My first visit was on a whim.  I ordered the roasted veggie sandwich but was put off by the lack of a vegetarian option to go with the sandwich (Cesar salad is not vegetarian.)  I asked the waitress to sub the roasted veggie salad, she said she'd check on it, and let me know.  She ends up bringing me the sandwich with the salad.  I thought it was all very good.  She was super friendly, and the friend I was with even thought she was great and was impressed with her service. But they ended up charging me for the salad by mistake, forgetting I asked to sub it.  No problem, they comped it off, all was well, first world crisis averted. I took to CPK's Facebook page, not out of anger over the situation, but to suggest they do something about their menu options with sides for the sandwiches.  For a place that touts they cater to both vegetarians and vegans, they really need to find a vegetarian side to go with the sandwich. They not only apologized by they went above and beyond what I expected and gave me a $40.00 gift certificate! I used the gift certificate once after getting it, and that was on the roasted veggie salad.  I tucked the gift certificate away until my family came for a visit, we went there on a Saturday afternoon, I gave the waiter my gift certificate, but then he came back and said there was nothing on there.  The only thing it had been used for was on the price of one roasted veggie salad, this was impossible.  But it was my word against theirs.  I had no proof of use of what I used it for, I was totally at their mercy. We wait there for quite some time while they try to contact somebody at the corporate office, but they couldn't get anybody on the weekend.   The manager ends up honoring it for what I estimated was left on the certificate, which was around $26.00.  She said they would contact me if they had any problems with using the certificate after they contacted corporate on Saturday.  The food here is over all solid.  Not every meal I've had pops for me, they still need to develop some decent side options to the sandwiches, but it's a pizza place first and foremost, I get it sandwich and a good side isn't their driving factor.  The food: Four stars at best.  Yes, I am a fan.  Management and staff have always been excellent when I have gone here, about as good as it gets!  WOOHOO!  FIVE STARS! Ignore the haters, this place may not have the best food in Kansas City, but you get a solid meal for your money, and they treat you well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-leawood,3.44,3.44,3.44,3.3800000000000003,3.4400000000000004

There's a parking garage right next door, so parking is never an issue, and in the evening the tiny shopping center (directly next to it) is a cute place to stroll before or after you eat!

101,Justin M.,"Seattle, United States",6,168,8.0,1.0,2016-06-04,This is the worst California Pizza Kitchen ever. Terrible service and continual menu changes make dining here a terrible experience. They burnt my pizza crust and no longer carry the pizza nor the drink I like. My server just laughed when I mentioned this. I recommend avoiding this location unless you are looking for a terrible experience.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-leawood,3.64,3.64,3.64,,3.6400000000000006

Although we came in during peek hours, they were able to quickly accommodate 8 of us with prompt customer service.  A little disappointed with the limited lunch menu. Regular items are a bit pricey for lunch. I ended up ordering from their regular menu and tried the Jamaican Jerk pizza, small plate wedge salad and peach lemonade. All were very good.  There were a few folks in my group that had issues with redeeming a free birthday desert through their app. Russ, the manager on duty, swiftly took action and made it right.

90,Crystal C.,"Lathrop, United States",86,156,33.0,4.0,2017-01-10,I can't deny it.. I'm a straight CPF fan! My boss has catered in from this location several times. Each time I'm more impressed by the flavors. My favorite thus far is the Thai chicken pizza! I could eat a whole one by myself. Recently I was surprised by their quac which was birthing short of delicious! They put corn in the quac & it adds that extra little fresh flavor. The salads that are offered alongside of the tasty pizza classics are fresh & packed with the freshest most delectable toppings! Oh you like bacon in your salad? How about we throw whole slices of crispy bacon in! Fresh beets! Boiled eggs! Blue cheese! I just can't get enough.
