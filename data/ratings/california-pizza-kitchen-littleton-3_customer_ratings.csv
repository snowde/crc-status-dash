This location is tricky, it can be insanely busy on the weekends or during the week at lunch time. If you head there early you shouldn't have a problem getting in.  The biggest gripe I have about this place is how expensive it is. $12 for a pizza and $9 for a salad. Kind of high if you ask me. But when I am looking for a good filling salad, I'll still head here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-littleton-3?start=40,3.2120000000000006,3.2120000000000006,3.2120000000000006,3.2120000000000006,3.212000000000001
15,Samantha E.,"University Heights, OH",174,895,271.0,3.0,2012-06-19,"CPK has never been my favorite pizza, but some of their offerings are great and you have to give them credit for consistency. I came here with a friend for dinner last week on a weeknight; we hadn't seen each other in a while so we were planning on having a relaxing dinner to catch up.  Our waitress seemed intent on not allowing that to happen.  She asked us for our drink order within seconds after I sat down, for our food order within seconds of opening the menu, and seemed visibly unhappy every time we had to tell her we were going to need another moment.  Later, when we wanted the check, we couldn't find her.  Go figure. On the bright side, the food was as good as I had remembered.  We split the barbecue chicken pizza and, continuing the theme, the barbecue chicken salad.  I love the flavor combination on the pizza and the salad was good as well-- I think the corn and black beans go very well with the chicken and barbecue sauce.  It's nice that it's a chopped salad as well.  My glass of wine was reasonably priced and so was my friend's sangria, which she enjoyed. I'd go back because I like CPK and I like Park Meadows, but I'd hope to sit in a different section.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-littleton-3?start=20,3.2760000000000007,3.2760000000000007,3.2760000000000007,3.2760000000000007,3.276000000000001

My visit to this Park Meadows location was no exception.  I ordered the Spicy Chicken Chipotle pizza and split a Moroccan Chicken Salad with my friend.  The pizza was delicious, and it really was spicy, as promised.  The Moroccan Chicken Salad is my favorite salad on the menu and I was not dissappointed.  It has spiced butternut squash, beets, avacados an almonds, and the dressing is light and amazing.

We ordered the Artichoke and Spinach Pizza on thin crust and the Mushroom Pepperoni Sausage Pizza on honey-wheat whole grain crust.  Both were excellent.  The whole grain crust was a little dry, maybe overbaked.  Toppings were plentiful and evenly distributed.

I came here for a late lunch with a close friend after doing some shopping at IKEA; we had a hankering for some pizza! Upon arrival, I was slightly surprised by how small this location is! They do offer outside seating, but it was a bit chilly and we opted to wait around 10 minutes for a table inside.  We were served by Kelly and I am happy to say she was one of the most fantastic waitresses I have had at any restaurant. She was quick and attentive, always bringing refills of our drinks before we finished the previous glasses. The food, as usual, was great. I have never been disappointed with the food at California Pizza Kitchen and this was no exception. I had the California Club Pizza and it was perfect. The Spinach Artichoke Dip is also fantastic and I used the leftovers to dip my pizza crust in. Quirky? Yes, but it was awesome.  Overall, I had an extremely pleasant lunch here. The only recommendation I would have is to show up a little early if you are coming during a peak time. Park Meadows is a popular location for shopping and with the small nature of this restaurant, waiting times could increase pretty quickly.

The order took longer time, might be lot many pizzas were ahead of our order.

I am debating whether the proportions are worth the money in general. Literally I paid $9.25 for a side salad quantity. Yes the salad was good and yes the actual lettuce could have been fresher. I will not be going back just because of the fact of you do not get the value for your money. The service was just fine. My salad I had asked for one dressing on the salad and the other off the salad. I didn't even get the other type of dressing that I wanted. As I wanted to try there white balsamic and that is why I ordered it online and was specific but nope. California pizza your food may be good but it is not worth what I paid for it.

I ordered a full-size Thai Chicken pizza and I even got my veggies in for the day. The base peanut sauce was a unique and delicious start, topped with grilled chicken, slivered carrots and bean sprouts. Winning combo right here.

The highlight of the meal was our sever Alexis. After we asked to sit on the patio Alexis greeted us and immediately noticed our table was wobbly. She went and got some coasters to stabilize the table. Big bonus points. Throughout the meal she refilled drinks, made sure we were ok and was an awesome waitress. I had the Jamaican jerk thin crust pizza. The sauce is a little sweet but the jerk seasoning, bacon, onions and peppers helped to balance it.  I also had bites of the roasted vegetable salad with grilled chicken and shrimp (extra add-ons). The dressing was a little heavy but otherwise it's very tasty. Definitely going to go back again. Thanks again to our great server Alexis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-littleton-3,4.2,4.2,4.2,,4.2
49,Chrissie O.,"Escondido, CA",251,807,857.0,4.0,2016-06-06,I was pleased with my visit at CPK.  We were starving so we stopped here after landing. I told the hostess it's my first time at their location. They told us about their sign up list thing and if you do it then you can get a free appetizer. Yes of course I will do it! I was also surprised that the manager stopped at our table and gave us a free flatbread which was delicious and so nice of them to do. We ended up sharing a bunch of plates. I really liked the chicken Thai pizza. Thai peanut sauce is always delicious. Also had the penne pasta with pesto. Another delicious choice! Pesto another one of my weaknesses. Definitely a great place to go if you are in the area or hungry after shopping!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-littleton-3,4.2,4.2,4.2,,4.2

I ordered it today only to find when my food arrived that they have no more habanero salsa! Bummer! I would not of ordered the dish if I would've known. They tried to give me another sweet salsa but it was clearly not what I wanted! The waitress had no offers replacing anything. I think it was in her first week of working. My partner ordered a veggie pizza. And I guess if it's possible she said it was overly flavorful! Disappointing service disappointing food everything was a disappointment today. Probably won't be back! Only been coming to CPK for years! Sorry it ended like this...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-littleton-3?start=20,4.08,4.08,4.08,,4.08

I know a lot of employees and whatever restaurant you would call before they open would of not answer the phone or just tell you to call back at 11am when we open. She is an asset to your company. She was extremely nice when she answer the phone and immediately she said sure I can take your order. Wow I will definitely be frequenting your restaurant a lot more.

Tonight, we ordered to go for our family hoping for a better outcome.  COMPLETE FAIL.  We ended up having to call a delivery service to produce the two hour old pizza - another $40 charge.  Ted, the manager, is absolutely useless and unhelpful.  Do not trust anything he says.   I will never try this restaurant again.  Long time fan - will never return!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-littleton-3,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0

I order it with dressing on the side and then comes the question, ""would you like a side of avocado with that?""   The price for that side just went up from $2.75 to $3.00!!!!!   Are you flipping kidding me?  Do you know I can buy 1-3 full avocado's for that price.  I'm pretty sure as a nationwide chain, you can do MUCH  better than I can.  Yet you without shame, boldly stick it to your customers.  Irritating!  Now if you don't want avocado with your food and you think they aren't bolding sticking it to you with your pricing, please step inside and order away.  My choice, no surcharge or $1.50 tops.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-littleton-3,3.92,3.92,3.92,,3.92

10,T K.,"Riverton, UT",0,18,1.0,1.0,2017-05-08,"Quiet for a Tuesday night at 6, and so better service was expected. Started with some wine at the bar. While sitting here had to watch the bartender mispour a glass of white wine for another table. Then tried to ""pawn"" it off on the other waitresses so the store could make up for the ""loss"". My salad comes out with the meal which seemed a bit odd, and was wrong as it had ingredients I'd previously asked not be included. While eating my meal(which was good don't hear me wrong!), I'm watching the manager negotiate with the waitress and bartender over who gets to go home first--at the Bar, in front of customers!  Who does this???  Then a waitress comes up to speak with the manager about how the cooks are screwing up her orders and she won't talk to them anymore, and he needs to go back and talk to them because they don't know the difference between cucumber and corn???  The last thing I get the privilege to hear is how one of the waitress' ""who-ha"" hurts so bad because of what she did yesterday--a Brazilian. While it's nice to know you trimmed the bushes sweetheart, it's not complimentary to my appetite for some dinner.

42,Rolanda H.,"Houston, TX",85,58,317.0,2.0,2017-08-05,Although I love California Pizza Kitchen I was highly disappointed when I had dinner at this location. Our menus were sticky and dirty. The extra plates and area around our tables were dirty. I ordered a BBQ Chicken Salad and on my second bite I bit into balled up paper that I am assuming was used for portion prep. I brought it to my waitress attention and she apologized and brought a fresh salad out. I also over heard her tell a manager about the issue and they did not suggest any other ways to accommodate me or cared to know what table had the issue. One of my coworkers also had a salad and her lettuce had huge ice burg lettuce chucks. It seemed as if whoever was prepping did not take their time prepping.
