67,Jen S.,"Los Angeles, CA",296,53,8.0,2.0,2012-05-10,"I usually like my dosage of CPK but this location is a bit different.  As far as the food goes. I love the avocado club egg rolls, the thai crunch salad, and the thin crusted pizzas they have. I do enjoy the selection of options and also cpk's new smaller dishes that let you try more without committing to a huge plate of it. I personally enjoy CPK but I would probably advise you to go to a different location.  For some reason each time I go, the service just makes me feel like I suddenly am disappearing into the booth cushion and no longer exist. The first few times, the hostesses really just didn't pay any attention and each and every time I go (because it's close) my server always tells me some excuse about why my food isn't ready yet.  Note to all servers: all I'm thinking about is why my food is running late. Why are you telling me a story about why it's running late and not checking on it right now? I don't mind a heads up that it will be out soon. Don't tell me so and so got it confused and so and so had to figure out how to fix....i don't really care sweetheart.

It should be obvious that every customer that walks in to a restaurant is there to eat inside, not ordering a food as to-go. After ordering our dishes, the waitress says it would take longer than usual (only 2 of us ordered a simple sandwich) and asks if we wanted it in a box. Now, why in the world should be order food as a to-go in a restaurant when 4 of us walks in and sits down at a table?  Our dishes come out an hour later, portion was small, and we left with a hungry stomach.  I strongly do not recommend this place if you plan on going to CPK.

I was told the cross streets and tried to use Yelp to help me with directions.  But it didn't have this location listed.  It was listed on CPK's website so I knew it had to exist.  I was already familiar with the area, so all I had to do was look for a Ruby's and I knew it was right behind that.  Once I had gotten there, I knew I had visited this location like 3 or 4 years ago.  So for it not to be listed on Yelp was a surprise. We go inside and I notice that everyone working was professionally dressed (button down shirt and black slacks) compared to earlier in the week when I visited a CPK at the Anaheim Garden Walk where the workers were dressed in whatever they wanted to wear. So when I saw the employees here, I was relieved that CPK hadn't lowered their standards on how to dress. I got my traditional cheese pizza and my friend ordered a salad.

The first location I went to was in Brentwood, 15 or so years ago. CPK's menu gets tweaked occasionally, and they've had some nice new, non pizza, additions to the menu as of late.  Facilities: well kept, comfortable, clean and well lit. Service: Great! Our server, Michelle, was very friendly, informative and as fast as she could be. The only thing keeping it from being perfect is that our area was understaffed so she couldn't get to everyone quite as quickly as she wanted to. Drinks: had water and coffee. The coffee was nice and strong. First cup was not very hot, the next was from a fresh, hot pot. The cream is served in dinky little thimbles though, so you should ask for a few extra. Food: Very good! Had their chili relleno and that was very tasty, especially considering that this is a gringo restaurant :-D Their salad with caramelized peaches was excellent! Very delicious, especially with the grilled chicken added for some substantive protein content. We had the dressing in the side and had no need to use it because it had such a delicious flavor without it.

We were immediately greeted by a group a friendly hostesses. We came around 4:00pm on a Friday so the lunch crowd had gone and they were prepping for the dinner crowd. Our server Robin greeted us immediately and took our drink orders. We decided to try the ""small plates"" as our appetizer. Our server did offer to put a complimentary bread basket on the table but we declined because we knew we were going to go into carb overload. It was nice that she asked first instead of just plopping it on the table. Who can resist warm bread?  Anyway, we truly enjoyed the small plates. I had the asparagus arugula salad and my mom had the petite wedge. Both were very refreshing and different from your typical run of the mill salads. We were in a pizza kind of mind so we chose to have the new roasted garlic chicken pizza and the meat cravers pizza. Let me just say CPK knows how to make pizza honey. Both pizzas were absolutely mouth watering. I like the pizza dough that they use. It's so light and flaky. Whenever I eat pizza at other establishments I feel stuffed after eating 2 slices but CPK pizzas aren't like that. The ingredients on the pizza are the stars not the dough which means you really get the full taste of the pizza and not just a mouth full of crust.

There were girls demanding MORE BREAD or WE NEED WATER over the chatters of 28 pairs of mouth, I can understand how our party could've been daunting to take on. But what they did at the end of the night was inexcusable.  But first, what I (and basically everyone) ordered - Valentine $30 course: this was a AWESOME deal that they had going on for Valentine couples. And it was A LOT of food, we had to share it between four people. Idk how two people can finish this meal. Or maybe I can, because...well, 'MURICA. We had the spinach artichoke dip, bbq chicken pizza, creamy garlic pasta AND a red velvet cake for dessert. Everything was super delicious and we all had a great time.  Now here's my gripe: at the end of the meal, they overcharge us $80! After we put in our money for the meals, we couldn't understand how we could've been short by SO much, with tax and tip included into the meal. After close inspection of the receipt, they charged us for our $30 vday meal and then charged the same items as extra items! Of course, we thought it was a mistake, but when the waitress looked at it she blatantly says it was all correct! Now we knew something was wrong. The manager came over and looked over the receipt, she then whisked away without a word and took off some items and said it was correct and she left before we looked at it. After inspecting the receipt, we were still charged extra for 3 pastas, 2 red velvet cakes and 4 pizzas. This is ridiculous! The only thing she took off was 1 pasta. We called the waitress back and showed her item by item and how were not suppose to be charged for these. The cold and lifeless look on her face says it all: she's playing dumb. Are they seriously going to cheat 26 asian girls. Uh, I don't think so! Then our blood was boiling. At the end they took off the extra items EXCEPT for one pizza.

On a Wednesday night we were seated promptly and had attentive service throughout our entire meal. Being poor college students at a place with steep prices, we shared:  - WHITE CORN GUACAMOLE + CHIPS: Wonderful guacamole. Loved the corn; it gave a sweet taste, and a textural difference. Only drawback was the ratio of guacamole-to-chip ratio was off, and we wished we got a tad bit more of guacamole.   - WHITE PIZZA: Amazing pizza, loved the little bits of ricotta all throughout. Would definitely get it again.  Only drawbacks is that I wish that our waitress refilled our bread and soda.  Overall, all CPKs have expensive prices for little portions.

My friends and I decided to get food, and one of them was craving CPK... so, we ended up here. It wasn't our first visit to this location. Upon arriving, they greeted us, and although it was fairly busy, we were sat pretty much immediately. It wasn't long before our server greeted us and asked if we had any questions and what we'd like to drink.  We were starving, so we were ready to order as soon as our drinks and bread arrived. I don't stray away from my usual orders often, so I ordered what I normally get at CPK - the BBQ chicken salad. Well, YUUUMMM! I don't know if I was super hungry or what, but today, the BBQ chicken salad just tasted amazing! We shared the butter cake at the end, and it satisfied all our sweet tooths... teeth? Lol. Our server was very attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly. I'd definitely recommend him as your server if you decide to visit! I'm pretty sure his name was Paul - like 95%.

It came out perfectly prepared and tasty.  It was the highlight of dining here, but unfortunately the overall experience  was not as good as it should have been. ...which brings me to why I am giving this CPK only 3 stars... Their service here was about as slow as it gets.  We were here for at least 45 minutes longer than we needed to be.  Our waiter and the hostess were actually very friendly and great.  The issue was that they were so understaffed that we hardly saw them and had to wait for a long time for everything. I should have realized there would be an issue when we arrived on a Wednesday night and there was no hostess at the front.  She was apparently helping the wait staff, but then came running to get my name once she saw us at the front counter.  She told us that it would be a 5-10 minute wait (even though 2/3rds of the seating was empty).  So we came back 15 minutes later, and when she saw us she came running up again and seated us.  That pretty much set the tone for the rest of our time here.  Both the hostess and our waiter were as friendly as could be, but it was obvious that they were very understaffed.  What was a great meal was dampened by having to wait so long for each and every thing.  I'd rather visit another CPK that has enough staff to operate the restaurant appropriately.  It was a huge waste of time, and it makes me hesitant to eat here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach-2?start=60,3.52,3.52,3.52,3.436,3.5200000000000005

I started making this place my Monday night spot and I never leave disappointed. The customer service is spot on every single time. Mary and Brian behind the bar make killer drinks and they make sure you're well taken care of. Any of the servers that you get are great but I sit at the bar mainly to watch the big TVs they have hanging.  The only draw back is that I tend to fall in love with ""seasonal"" salads and as it states they are only seasonal(gone sooner than later) The Caramelized Peach salad was amazing--gone. My saving grace in that is the manager who always seems to be on duty when I go in. April. Not only is she always checking on customers around the resturant, she assured me that aside from the seasonal peaches, she could have the chefs remake the salad any time which goes way above and beyond in my book. Customer service is what gets people to come back and I'll be back for sure. Probably every Monday.  BY THE WAY do NOT let your sweet tooth go un-satisfied. Whatever you do, ask for April and have her make you ""The Dirty Butter"". It's CPK's butter cake but it has Caramel AND Chocolate sauce drizzled over it with cookie crumbles and some secret addition that kicks it over the top. Not to mention the ice cream.

I tried making it at home and failed so that's why I still keep ordering it. :) Best way to beat the system here is when they have the $10 off $40 with your CPK rewards and if you can buy the gift cards through Costco. Otherwise, I cannot seem to afford the new menu anymore just for a simple lunch with the family since it now costs me over $60 with 2 kids and 2 seniors.

Both were equally satisfying. The staff displays exceptional communication skills & they want you to feel comfortable. The lunch specials and the classic BBQ chicken pizza hit the spot.

On the best night, it can be romantic, especially if you're sitting across the pizza oven which is like a fireplace (and a dinner show- these worker bees feel like a bad Circue di Soleil show and tge relentlessly busy pizza chefs are on point).

We ordered a cup of fruit for our daughter that was supposed to come before dinner, it didn't. We waited 40 minutes for our food. My wife had to ask another waitress about our food. When it finally came the ""To Go"" guy brought it over. My wifes order was completely wrong so she had to wait even longer. After that, no one, and I mean no one came over to check on us. I saw managers and waiters flying by with food and tending to other customers. Just not us. Our table was within eye sight of the bar. I could see my waitress working the bar the entire time. She completely forgot about us. Next time I saw her it was time for the check. That took forever too.

57,Michelle T.,"Orange County, CA",1018,365,2768.0,4.0,2016-01-08,"The Long Beach Marketplace is well-known for its shopping opportunities. However after making several purchases, you'll eventually need to catch lunch or dinner before you leave. Therefore, my coworkers suggested that we meet for lunch at California Pizza Kitchen.  CPK is located on the corner of Pacific Coast Highway and 2nd Street in the city of Long Beach. It is in the northeast corner of the lot, facing PCH. Ample parking is available throughout the shopping center but if it's packed, you can always park across the street. My coworkers arrived before me so they were already seated at a table. As I looked around, I noticed that most tables had bench seats just like their booths. That makes sense to me because I look at it from a safety perspective. People tend to trip over chairs and I like that CPK took that into consideration when working on the layout and decor of their restaurant. When you think of CPK, most people probably associate pizza with this restaurant. However, their menu has a lot more available to people who might want something different. They have a variety of salads as well as fish selections like halibut and salmon. If you're not in the mood for pizza, you could order pasta as an alternative. I was feeling very hungry so I chose the pesto cream penne pasta. I omitted the tomatoes but added shrimp. While we waited for our food to arrive, our server brought us some bread with an herb-olive oil dip. There were four of us in our party but there were only 5 pieces of bread. I thought that was a bit odd since it didn't seem to be enough for anyone who may have wanted to eat a couple of slices of bread.  Soon after, our meals arrived and then our server brought out another plate of bread. I guess she realized the error and caught it before we could say anything. She was really on top of things. Yay!!! The serving size was perfect for lunch as it was enough to fill me up without making me feel like I overindulged in a heavy meal. The pesto sauce was light and had a creamy blend with great flavor. The shrimp was grilled and the meat was nice and firm with each bite. The tails were still on each one so I removed them prior to eating my pasta. My coworkers really enjoyed their meals too as all but one finished what they ordered. My friend took the rest home to finish for dinner later that evening. I really liked CPK as it's a healthier alternative to some of the other pizza places. The health conscious individuals will be able to find something specific to their dietary needs. Gluten free options are also available upon request. CPK is ideal for a quick meal with a small group of people. Larger parties might find this place to be a bit limited when it comes to accommodations. I'm very happy that I finally had a chance to dine at California Pizza Kitchen because the food was delicious. I recommend CPK to anyone who wants a quick, filling meal at a decent price. Service is great, the restaurant is clean, and their menu is diverse enough for people that want to explore many options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach-2,3.8,3.59,3.59,3.3760000000000003,3.674

Location: Located in the Market Place shopping center it sits on the corner directly behind the Trader Joe's grocery store off of Pacific Coast Highway Décor:  All their restaurants are decorated with light woods and yellows that feature a modern sleek design.    Menu:  The menu has a nice variety of pizza's, sandwiches, pastas, salads, etc.  I particularly enjoy the fresh herbs that help in creating a good dish.  They offer several signature fare that compel you to keep coming back for more such as the Quinoa Arugula Salad, Five Cheese Pizza, and a personal fav is The Original BBQ Chicken Pizza (Yum).  The bread and olive oil dip is good as well.  FYI:  They offer gluten free options as well as vegetarian choices.    Service:  Though nothing extraordinary it is always friendly and attentive.  FYI:  They do not take reservations; it is a first come first serve basis.  I have never had to wait very long for a table. Atmosphere:  The atmosphere is casual mid-level sit down dining experience.  They have take-out services as well Restrooms: Large bathrooms that were well maintained Final Thoughts: What I appreciate about The California Pizza Kitchen is that you can feel confident that you always receive a good experience no matter which location you go to.  The Long Beach location is no exception to this rule.  I personally prefer coming for lunch as the prices are more reasonable and you get pretty much the same selections.  This is a good standard choice for a dining experience at the Market Place in Long Beach.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach-2?start=20,3.88,3.64,3.64,3.184,3.736

3,Andrew P.,"Long Beach, CA",138,341,761.0,4.0,2016-06-03,"One of my favorite restaurants since forever - CPK has always been my go-to restaurant for special occasions, birthdays, etc. I've always enjoyed the atmosphere here and they have been constantly changing the looks of it for the better each time.  I always order a salad and pizza, and every time they come out tasting on point no matter when I come in. I have been to this location many, many times and every time we have typically had great service. No complaints there. Although, this last time it did take a while for our salad and soup to come out. Not a problem though.  One of the girls brought us waters and accidentally spilt one of them all over the table and a little bit on another person in the party. Again, no worries. We understand that those things happen and it was totally out of her control. We were assured that it would get cleaned up as soon as possible, and it was. Even the manager came over and made sure everything was ok after that. Kudos to this location for always having great customer service and valuing their customers; it is so key to running a successful business.  I will say though, that they have definitely been raising their prices and it has led us to choose other options lately. Not that we don't enjoy coming here, but it's just become a lot more pricey. For the 3 of us, our total came out to over $110 not including tip. That is with the alcoholic beverages of course, but it still seemed pricey for a casual dinner. Nonetheless, we will still be back of course.  Two notes I may add:  We continue to still really like their complimentary bread and oil that's provided (this time we were provided another plate of bread additionally without asking and of course devoured it). We love bread as you can tell.  Secondly, I'm still very disappointed that the California Club sandwich was taken off the menu. It's been gone from the menu for a while, but I really enjoyed it. They have a pizza version of it, but I'm not a fan of it as much. I wish they could bring it back onto their menu.  Again, a very solid restaurant and the location is great if you're driving along PCH or near the beach area.

The manager came out I wish I got his name but he was African American about 35 ish years old (sorry if I'm off) he told me that there was a  mistake and assured me the correct pizza was in the oven and I actually would be getting both. A free pizza who would say no? But the experience was awesome they honestly did not have to do that but I appreciated that and also a worker up front opened the door for us and asked us which door we were leaving through and that he would open it for us.

Companies have no one to blame but themselves when going out of business.  I was just here a few minutes ago. I was very hesitant about coming here considering the horrible service from years ago; yes, it's been years since I came to this location. No matter how many times I drove-by, I would never think once about coming here.  I went against my instincts and dined here today. I sat at the counter. The waitress asked what I wanted to drink. I told her water and that I would like to start with the white corn guacamole and chips. That was delivered really fast. More than ten minutes went by and no contact with the server. She talked to the couple to the left...just shooting the shit, then walked away to perform another task. Another server began shooting the shit with the couple, then walked right by and talked to the guy next to me while taking his plate. By now I've had it. I bluntly said ""would someone take my order"".  The manager guy was very apologetic and took my order. He somewhat became the server from that point-on. By now, I was disgusted both at the unacceptable service and with myself for giving-in, going against my instincts and returning here after many years.  The server was whispering crap to the couple; talking in low key...like telling a secret. Not sure what it was about, but regardless, that is unacceptable behavior, especially in front of other customers.  One big mistake servers and restaurants make quite often is treating their ""local/frequent"" customers better than what they mistakingly think and label as outside customers. I've read many complaints and reviews about that behavior. I've also witnessed it.  A word of caution, they should be very careful with labeling regular customers because a customer which they never see that suddenly dines in the restaurant, could be one of their biggest customers by ordering everyday through various online delivery services or even messenger services. Furthermore, that person could be ordering under a different name such as the name of his assistant who places the order on behalf of their boss or team, the name of the messenger, etc. The point is that they should treat every single customer as a ""normal/frequent"" customer. But, as usual, having someone process a thought is nearly impossible nowadays. With other customers, the server was fine, but with me, not so much. The manager provided excellent service, but no service situation should ever have to reach that point. A server should be qualified and capable of doing their job correctly.  I only left $3 for the tip, but seriously regret doing so. This place is officially blacklisted for life. There are many alternatives available. The restaurant industry and CPK type food a monopolistic competition; CPK clearly has no monopoly on the industry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach-2,3.92,3.81,3.81,,3.854

She told the chef to cook more chicken for my mom's plate but by this time we were just in complete shock. I know it's a restaurant but isn't there like a certain amount they normally put? When they brought the plate, the manager (female with dice tattoo on arm, can't remember name) brought it over and told us that they can put more chicken we just have to ask for extra chicken. Yeah, but I'm sure they charge another $3 right??? I asked what the amount of chicken they put and she told me ""We are supposed to put 2.5 ounces of chicken. I don't agree with the amount, but that's protocol."" I'm not asking for a whole chicken on my plate but if I'm asking for chicken on my pasta I want a decent amount of chicken on my plate, especially if I'm paying for like $15++ for my plate. Our server was nice and helpful so that's why I'm not giving 1 Star. I think they need to stop being so stingy with their food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach-2,3.76,3.76,3.76,,3.76
