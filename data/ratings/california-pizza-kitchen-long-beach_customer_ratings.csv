The white corn guacamole w/chips - which was smooth and had a sweet kick due to the white corn. The white pizza (substitute the ricotta cheese with goat cheese instead) - salty, savory, and delicious all at once. The carnitas habanero pizza - orgasmic.

238,Erica J.,"Los Angeles, CA",125,252,43.0,4.0,2012-11-03,"Wow, the menu at CPK has certainly changed.  I liked it before, but it has definitely upped the ante on taste.  Gone are some of the old favorites, but there are a lot of ""new"" things to try.  Then again, it's been a while since I've been to CPK and gotten something other than my standby pizzas, so perhaps the new menu's really old.  They do have a handful of small plate menu items, which I know for sure are new.  Looks promising! In any case, the Moroccan-Spiced Chicken salad was a fresh mix of textures and flavors, with dates, cranberries, golden and red beets roasted to subtly sweet perfection (I love beets, so I'm biased here), toasted almonds, and nicely spiced chicken.  I'd recommend it for anyone who likes Mediterranean flavors and textures, with a bit of sweet and tart and crunch.  The Spicy Chipotle Chicken pizza surprisingly had a nice kick to it, not being overly spicy but having just a bit of heat to warm up the palate.  Usually, spicy at American-style food places means nothing, but this pizza carried its own.  My mom really liked the half and half Two in a Bowl soup option, with the Sedona Tortilla Soup on one side, with the Dakota Smashed Pea and Barley Soup on the other.  My brother got the Kung Pao Spaghetti with shrimp, and I could see him tearing up from the spice of the Thai red chili peppers they use in the sauce.  All in all, the food was great, and my family had a good, quick meal, with something for everyone. On top of that, this CPK was fast, convenient, and had great service!  Our server, Devin, was all smiles, and he checked on us regularly throughout the meal.  We never had to ask for water or refills of drinks.  He was always at the ready.  The rest of the staff who brought our food and cleared our table was excellent too.  After going to other CPK locations where I've had really bad service, it was really pleasant to eat at this location and have great service.  Quick, but without making us feel rushed.  Smiles and courtesy. This CPK is at The Pike, located across the street from the Long Beach Convention Center.  It wasn't busy at all when we got there (~6pm), since I'm guessing there's more of a late-night crowd here, given the clubs and bars in the area.  There's metered street parking at The Pike, but some are only 24 minutes spots.  We parked at a 2 hour meter directly outside of CPK (on the other side of the lane).  Bring your quarters if you plan on parking at the meters!  They're old school meters, at $1/hour.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach?start=220,3.52,3.52,3.52,2.9920000000000004,3.5200000000000005

This is one of my favorite restaurant chains to go to so my husband and I went to this location around 2:00 pm for a late lunch. I already knew what I wanted to order because I had been to this restaurant many times in Hawaii so this should have been a fast lunch. When we were walking in we saw a table of people from the patio get up and leave. When we got inside there was no host or hostess at the stand. when she appeared several minutes later she was very rude and when we asked to sit outside she said there were no seats outside for almost an hour (she did not even check outside) we pointed through the window at the empty table and said theres one we want to sit there. She said she could not seat us there for 10 minutes because it needed to get cleaned although there was no one ahead of us in line. After ten minutes, she took us to the empty table. Again, I already knew what I wanted to order and after the 10-20 minute wait at the front, my husband knew what he wanted to order. NO ONE came to our table to help us!! One male server passed by us to help the table next to us three different times, he never said hi or spoke to us at all. One female server passed us four times to help the tables on the other side of us and she also did not speak to us at all. The manager even came out to deliver food to a table and he said nothing to us either. We sat there for almost 30 minutes with closed menus and no one offered us drinks or even spoke to us. My husband asked the female server who our server was and asked for them to help us right away. No one did. Finally, when the male server passed us a fourth time, my husband had to very loudly ask for him to help us and the male server said I dont think you are my table and went inside.

He was very personable and courteous the entire time.  I think CPK has some of the best salads for great prices, i usually order a half portion which is still a great size (see my photo) I like the option of having half and full size portions. The bread was soooo good, baked to perfection and man that damn dipping oil...mmmmm good. I believe its pesto and garlic that's at the bottom of the oil...its so delicious, we couldn't stop eating it. I ordered the Chinese chicken salad, my sis ordered the Jambalaya and my friend ordered the Alfredo with chicken All 3 dishes were very good. My salad was fresh, not soggy or over dressed with dressing. My sisters jambalaya was excellent. It was spicy but very tasty, not over powering to the point where you couldn't enjoy it. If you want pasta with a kick then order this. The Alfredo was good too, not to dry but nice and creamy.  For desert i ordered the chocolate cake with ice cream. it was cool. The presentation was a bit sloppy i guess cause the ice cream had melted a bit before it came to the table, but i still ate most of it.

Granted, there was a huge rush of cheerleaders and their families coming from a competition nearby at the time we ate. When the food finally arrived, it was not that great. Cobb salad (with beets), garlic chicken thin crust pizza, and the lettuce wraps. When I order thin crust I look forward to a crispy, potato chipy texture, not chewy and cold crust. The cheese tasted off as well. I didn't like the other items we ordered but I accredit that for my personal dislike for bleu cheese and mushrooms.

Their pizza is just not good. We had the pizza with everything on it. It barely had cheese, the crust wasn't that great, and it was practically a thin crust. I was very disappointed. I expected a great pizza or at least one on the same level as Boston's across the street or BJ's (both of which I recommend rather than CPK). I talked to various friends about this and they agreed.

203,B M.,"Torrance, CA",0,2,,1.0,2014-03-24,"CPK is located directly across the street from the LB Convention Center. You would think they would be able to handle large crowds. WRONG!! They were horrible!  I knew it would be busy and so I made a reservation 5 days before I was going to be there.  Our party arrived prior to our reservation time and we were told that because they were busy that they gave away our table! We were not even late! They did apologize and then seated us on the patio (which was fine. But we were not happy that they gave away our seat...what if there was nowhere available to seat us??) We then ordered drinks and appetizers. And waited for almost 10 minutes to get our drinks. The server took our food order and asked if we wanted bread while we waited for our food. We said yes and then waited. And waited. And waited. 20 minutes later and no bread, no appetizers, and no drink refills. HORRIBLE! Another 10 minutes later the server reappeared and offered drink refills and apologized that we still hadn't received anything. After another 30 minutes of waiting a couple of the meals and one appetizer came out. Another 10 minutes and a couple more plates came out. After being at the restaurant for over 1.5 hours we finally asked to speak to a manager. We had to go back into the convention across the street and 3 of the 9 people at our table still hadn't received their meal. The manager ended up comp-ing the 3 meals we didn't get (he had them boxed to-go) and then gave us 20% off our bill.  Needless to say, we were still furious! All the tables around us came after we did, got their food before us, and were able to leave and be back to the convention on time. We ended up missing one of the speakers while waiting forever for our food and the bill. I will NEVER go back to this CPK nor will any of the people with me. (And we attend a convention held in LB every year) That is 9 customers they have lost.

It was pretty good, but I doubt I'll get it again. I order the Jamaican Jerk Chicken Pizza with a thin crust. It was really good. The only bad thing was that the crust was a little burnt. I still enjoyed it. As for the drinks, I order the Caribbean Sunset Sangria and the non alcoholic Piña Colada. The sangria was really good, especially because I am not a fan of sangria.

124,Kelly M.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,64,28.0,1.0,2014-04-16,"I was at this location a few days ago and had the worst CPK experience ever, due in whole to the snarky, ill-tempered manager Jason.  I will start with the positive, because--unlike Jason-- I'm not a moody sourpuss on an unwarranted power-trip.  Normally at CPK I get either the tequila lime fettuccine (with extraaaaa of that incredible creamy sauce) or the roasted veggie salad w/ salmon, however this day I craving something specific so I asked for my own customized pasta dish with a few ingredients to which the server (Slick Rick) and cooks obliged (and they did an impeccable job at that; I couldn't  leave a single noodle behind!). I will say that Rick was really friendly and accommodating-- he even brought me extra blueberries (twice) when he noticed my struggle to extract the blueberry from my [delicious but weak] sangria--which earned bonus points in my book. I mean who doesn't get super stoked when they're surprised with tiny blue balls, right? Since we weren't getting a buzz with our carafe, my girlfriend and I headed over to the bar to try our luck there. At the bar, we were pleased to meet the bartender, Casey, who whipped us up some wicked drinks with just the kick we were looking for; kudos to Casey for delivering on that front and MORE IMPORTANTLY for his friendly and upbeat demeanor.  So here's where things get iffy: my friends and I are at CPK for about an hour and a half having a lovely time when my homegirl and I leave to the car for a while and the 2 men left at our table start getting harassed to close out the bill cuz ""Slick Rick"" is getting off his shift. My buddy said he wasn't ready to close out, as they were still ordering beers (PLUS US LADIES HADNT HAD DESERT YET!!! Hello!! Women need chocolate!!) and apparently that wasn't cool by their standards (even though EVERY other place I go out to has no problem handing the table off to someone else and sorting the gratuity issues out with management---NOT in front of the customers OR forcing the customers out!) so they eventually called over the manager, Jason, who was acting like such a tool on a high horse, you'd think he was the CEO of CPK Corporate. Naturally, my friends were already pretty ticked by the time Jason came over to force us to close the tab out and it was provoked by Jason's attitude and unwillingness to let anyone speak, but Jason had no problem verbally sparring with the customers who's only complaint about the experience was that we weren't even close to being ready to leave. Jason was so rude that my buddy told him he'd make sure to write to corporate about this-- wellllll Jason must've been pooping bricks because after walking away with major attitude, he came back and gave us only minor snark (a huge improvement), and then told us he comped all the food and only charged us for the drinks. Talk about ridiculous--nobody was asking for anything free!! Literally all we wanted to do was stay longer and spend more money (I seriously wanted dessert and a couple more of Casey's awesome mixed drinks likely followed by more dessert!)  Anyway, we left and headed to Chili's where we drank for a couple more hours, got dessert, then ate again. FYI: Chili's policy for a server's shift ending is whoever puts the food on the table gets the tip---- AND they would never have anyone close out before they're finished eating (we asked---and the server at Chili's agreed that the whole sitch at CPK was incredibly tacky)!  Thank you to the exceptionally poor management for completely ruining what would have been a great CPK experience!

38,Jocelyn K.,"Ithaca, NY",17,172,27.0,3.0,2014-11-16,"I am giving this a 3 star review. I visited twice in two days (because the first visit was so good). The second visit was zero stars.  First visit was outstanding. Aside from them not having enough waitstaff and having to wait a long time to be seated, once we were seated, lunch was terrific. I ordered something that is no longer on their everyday menu-the Blt pizza. I had been craving one, and they graciously whipped it up. Other folks in my party were pleased with their food as well.  Second visit, not so good. We were seated right away. Our server had a very strange sense of humor and he thought he was funny. I didn't find him funny, and when I heard him say the same line to the table behind us that just sat down after us, I figured that this was a line he used often. Frankly, most of us are in long beach for pleasure, and we don't want to hear, about how we are having a better time than him And he doesn't want to get into it. If you don't like your job, then you should not be in the business!  That was the first bad.  Second, our food took 40 minutes to come out. After asking the server what was up, he went and checked. Said it would be a few more minutes. Finally, it arrived and so did the manager to apologize. He said they got slammed today and ran out of chicken. I was completely annoyed at this time and when he offered free dessert or free appetizers on our next visit, I just said no thank you.  Third bad once we started eating. One dish was fine, but the other was completely inedible. The chicken was petrified like it was microwaved. Obviously it was to quick thaw it. I asked the server to take it back and to take it off the bill.  The Save:  the manager came over again and apologized. He graciously comped the entire meal.  Three stars because he showed concern and that he cared about satisfying us. I have been in other places where management wouldn't even show their face when they knew they were wrong.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach?start=100,3.96,3.5,3.5,2.508,3.684

Besides, we have never eaten at one of these and wanted to give it a try. I can't speak for all the unusual combinations, but the basic margherita pizza was very good.   Not on a par with the best New Haven apizza, but still good.  In fact, we ordered a dinner pizza later in the week, a very similar one with tomatoes and five cheeses, and found it quite good. Both of our meals were take-out.

By this time we were reaching famine status so we devoured our meals regardless of the temperature. Okay? And the waitress reminded us that she was done with her shift and if we wanted to pay as soon as we got our meals, please.

Gluten free crust, oil and garlic sauce, no cheese, mushrooms, artichoke hearts and red onions only. Then 1 garden salad, NO CHEESE, NO DRESSING.  Got to curbside location 5 mins prior to time quoted.  Curbside spot is taken by someone who clearly parked there, and left to go elsewhere. Great ill call in and circle around and hopefully they move, they never did. Called and let the gal know, asked her were I should park so they can make it out to me, she told me to park in the bus. Sounds like a horrible idea.  So I tried to weasel my way into the drive way area, in front of the bus zone so I wasn't run over by the next bus. But after 15 mins no one comes out with my food. I call in and she tells me ""sorry we are just really busy right now, I'll tell them again"". Great. Another 15 goes by. REALLY ?! I call again, this is my 3rd call and I am pretty much over it. She said she would send someone right out. 10 mins and a gal comes out, has a receipt for a total only, no itemized listing and its 33.00. EXCUSE ME? 1 pizza and 1 salad, I question her and she says she doesn't know what I ordered, this is just the receipt I have to sign and she needs to swipe my card. Whatever, swipe away I'll pay if I can just get out of the bus zone(because about 6 buses have nearly run me over in the past 40 mins), and go home and eat. Sign away and I'm off.  When I get home I pull out the salad, it is small, and it has cheese on it. WASTE. Then I open the pizza, it is no longer warm, there are no artichokes, and no onions. Just, count them, 15 mushroom slices, on crust, that's it. NOTHING ELSE. No olive oil, not the rest of my toppings. Just some sad mushrooms slices on some cold crust. So I pick up a piece and I realize something is wrong. I cannot physically break the crust. Not with my hands, so I slam it on my table, nothing. Everything I pay for is a WASTE. I take pictures of it all. I call and ask for the manager and I am told ""he is very busy tonight I don't think he can speak to you, please give me your number""  Next day no phone call, so I call them.

He suggested a good alcoholic beverage for my friend, the better soup option for me and even asked the chef to make the field greens salad for me that is no longer on the menu.  As ugly as the weather was and even after Brian shared his experience of being in the LB power outage for 4 days, he was still upbeat, helpful, and directed us to the parking structure and venue we needed to get to for our concert.

62,Andrew H.,"San Francisco, CA",148,593,546.0,4.0,2015-10-01,"Overview: This California Pizza Kitchen (CPK) at the Long Beach pier shopping center (close to the movie theater, H&M, and comedy club) is a beautifully decorated, well run restaurant that no longer showcases its pizzas but focuses on ""general"" American food like pasta, steak, salads, etc (in the vein of BJs, Cheesecake Factory, and every other American chain). The Establishment: With a new theme of sustainable decorating, this CPK combines modern and rustic together in a fashion that seems to work very well. Lots of glass for views of the pier and a beautiful long bar for singles to mingle. Attentive wait staff, slightly lower than average volume, and a slightly dim atmosphere make it a very nice place to bring a date. Outdoor seating also plentiful and well maintained. The Food: I ordered the jambalaya while my wife ordered the Waldorf salad and we enjoyed both of them, with the salad besting the jambalaya. The jambalaya had shrimp (w/ tails still on), sausage, and a decent amount of spicy kick but what I didn't like about it was the overall burndt taste and the shrimp tails still being on. While I'm sure many foodies enjoy the presentation of tail-on shrimp, I eat somewhat like a vacuum cleaner and non-edible bits slow me down. the Waldorf salad was deliciously fruity, well balanced with the cheese/fruit/greens, and well sized. I wholeheartedly recommend it to everyone. Pricing for both was a bit expensive at a little less than $40 for the entire meal (tip included) but I suppose beach-side property rent and the recent remodel is to blame for the high prices. If you haven't been to a CPK in the past, remember that this is NOT a pizza place anymore. It's a general American restaurant that happened to specialize in pizza a few decades ago. Yes, you can try more than a dozen signature concoctions like truffle oil pizza but the entire selection of pizzas is now relegated to a tiny flap in the menu. Pastas, meat dishes, fish, and gourmet salads are now center stage and pricier than their pizzas. Conclusions: This CPK is a beautifully decorated, general American restaurant (not focused on pizza) that is located in a wonderful section of the Long Beach Pier bordering several attractions like a comedy club, a movie theater, and women's clothing shops. It's great for both families and dates, but it's a bit pricey for what you get.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach?start=40,3.44,3.37,3.37,3.216,3.398

It was late on a Friday night and the kids were across the street at a convention center.  I was ordering food to go prior to there closing.  Being a Friday night, it was busy in the restaurant right up until closing the doors at 10 PM. I had called in the order at 9:20, knowing they closed within the hour.  All went well with the ordering process even though it was loud on both ends of the phone.  I ordered a couple items that I hadn't had before, the quinoa and arugula salad and the spinach and asparagus spaghettini.  Ordered both with chicken.  The person I spoke with said it would be ready in 20 minutes.  I waited for a while then headed across the street.   I arrived at about 9:50 thinking they would have either given my food away to another customer because it was so late, but it looked like they were still seating customers walking in the door.  That was nice to see.  I waited at the front desk for a moment as the host was bringing other guests to their table.  He came back and asked if I needed anything.  I mentioned that I had a phone order and he directed me to the back counter.   I proceeded to the sign and register that I was directed to and waited for someone to come by.  Lots of people did, but no one offered to help me.  Guessing at least 10 staff passed by, but said nothing.  I can only assume they were busy, but it would have been nice to have been acknowledged for standing at a register for to go orders.  I then noticed one of the waiters who passed got the attention of another staff person.  Surely he was the guy overseeing the counter.  Sure enough, he was .  He came over to a woman who was eating at the counter next to the register and collected her bill with payment and returned to the other side of the counter to process her check/ payment.  So I continued to wait.  I saw staff carrying food from the kitchen and others with plates from floor to the bus station.  Others were simply walking back and forth along the counter with nothing in their hands.  Still nothing.     Finally, the same host who directed me to the counter walked passed.  My perplexed look probably told him that no one had helped me yet.  I inquired if anyone was working the register and he offered to grab my order.  He looked at the order line and found by ticket.  The only one hanging.  He looked down and found a couple of to go containers on the counter and told me he'd check to make sure the salad was being worked on.  He came back around and found what he was looking for right in front of the other container.  He started bagging up the items and told me he'd be right back with the waters and bread and butter I had ordered.  He then went around the counter to the other side and began talking with another member of the wait staff.  The talking began to look like joking around and more social chatting than anything.   Another waitress then came by and asked if I needed anything.  I mentioned that the other gentleman was going to get some waters, but looked like he was distracted. She smirked and agreed and said she would get them for me.  By this time, a manager came by and asked if I was being helped.  I mentioned I was being taken care of.  When the waitress returned with the waters I asked about the bread and butter and she immediately went to grab and bag them as well.  The host who initially helped me then walked by with a plate of food from the kitchen, grabbed a glass of water and proceeded to sit down for a meal.  Guess he was distracted with his own break time as well.

This review has nothing to do with our Waiter. My boyfriend and I  arrived Saturday April 30th, the hostess sat us at an elevated table near the take out pick up area. This is where the struggle began, we sat there for 15 minutes, multiple waitresses walked by stared and kept moving. Finally I flagged one down and said we have been here a really long time and have not been helped, plus we need a gluten free menu (the bf has the alergy). That young woman was in process of delvering another tables food. But she told another waitress, a blonde either a big black bow she looked at our table and obviously didn't want to deal. The orginal girl I flagged down she had dark brown hair then found the young man who ended up helping us. He informed us that our table doesn't have an assigned waiter /Waitress it's a pool area and apparently no one let anyone know we needed help. Well no one other than us flagging people down. Knowing we were anoyed the young man was awesome for helping us, especially after the blonde with the bow ignored us, she probably figured shev wouldn't get a tip since we sat unassisted for 15 minutes.  We ordered drinks my bf got a Agave lime margarita no salt, I ordered the strawberry lime margarita. The bartender messed up and made mine without the salt rim,  and my bf had salt. So those had to go back, I saw them pour my bf in a new glass, then mine in his old salted glass. Bf at this point wanted to get up and walk out, I said no which was my bad we should have left.  The pizzas come his gf one was good.  Mine was cold we had so many issues I didn't want to say anything because my bf was about to reach the lose his chill level of annoyed. The manager was obviously aware but because he seemed to circumnavigate our table when making his rounds to other customers and asking how they were doing he obviously did not care since he never came to our table. So it was clear he was trying to avoid us. The only saving grace of this place was our waiter, he was super friendly aplogetic,  and even got us a discount due to all the  mishaps. Management sucks, they need to be sure waitresses /waiters are informed of customers dining in a pooled area, abd actually try to rectify am issue and approach a table.

Already irritated that our waiter is shitty and my food isn't prepared how I asked, I asked the waiter could my corrections be made to my salad.

The good:  -cobb salad was decent, and i liked the orchard sangria, even though it was more ice than liquid. The bad: -Me and my gf sat at the bar area to be served and there were dirty glasses sitting in front of us for 10 mintues before anyone came to greet us. The bartender/waiter seemed overworked and was running from customer to customer making it difficult to get his attention. Staff was yelling at other staff because of mistakes being made which made it kind of awkward. Just seemed dysfunctional when it got busy. -Food took a while to get to us. When it did the appetizer was forgotten. I asked the server for some ranch which he said he'd bring but never did. Then I asked the bartender/waiter and he had to ask the staff several times before they actually brought it. And bbq chicken pizza was just ok, definitely nothing special or anything I'd ever want again. That might be the chicago in me coming out. For a bill of $50+ I expect alot better.

61,Matthew M.,"Long Beach, CA",13,28,10.0,5.0,2016-08-13,"We came here last night for my birthday dinner. I had only been to a California Pizza Kitchen once, a few years ago. I had a good experience then, so I figured this time wouldn't be to bad. Just like their name suggests, they offer pizza dishes as well as pasta dishes. Me and my husband both went for the pasta- the same exact dish actually. We both got the Garlic Parmesan Alfredo. My husband got meat in his, but I decided to go meatless this time. The dish was excellent and delicious. The garlic wasn't too strong and had the right amount of taste to it. The amount of parmesan and creaminess to it was perfect. The dessert section on the main menu at first seemed kind of disappointing with such a small selection, but after we were finished with our meal, our waitress gave us a separate dessert menu that had a few more selections on it. I decided to go with the chocolate souffle with a scoop of vanilla ocean cream.  The cake was good. The chocolate wasn't too sweet or overly rich and the vanilla ice cream added to it was a very nice touch, even if the ice cream does cost extra. My only complaint about the dessert is the price of the extra ice cream added to it. Normally I wouldn't spend $1.75 for just one measly scoop of ice cream, but chocolate cake and vanilla ice cream just go so well together that I couldn't resist. Our waitress foe the evening was incredibly nice and helpful. I believe her name was Randi. She was around whenever we needed a drink refilled and she didn't disappear for long periods of time like other waiters/waitresses do in other restaurants. Plus, she got our check ready for us quickly since we had somewhere to be at 10pm.

No call to let us know that they were behind, no ""we are sorry."" I bet they do not take 1.5 hours to prepare a meal for a dine-in patron.  Turns out this was not true. Our pizza was cold and congealed and had that sheen of pizza that has been sitting under a salamander for at least an hour. No bread. Lettuce cups with two pieces of spindly lettuce. And a salad with a side of chicken where the chicken strips were squished into a dressing cup barely registering two ounces on the home scale. Post-script - called back and spoke to another manager who agreed we deserved a refund but said that has to be done through Door Dash, but of course there is no way to reach anyone at Door Dash to lodge a complaint.

26,John D.,"Clovis, CA",0,2,,3.0,2017-03-10,"I have never once written a review on Yelp but I've had an awful day and going to this place was the last straw. My day started at 7am with getting off a fantastic cruise and quickly took a turn. As I made my way up the parking structure and neared my car, I noticed that the rim and tire were completely missing. As I got closer, I realized THEY WERE ALL GONE. Obviously, it's going to take me a little longer to get home that I thought. I start by trying to talk to Carnival Cruise ship people(useless) to get this sorted out but they could not care less even though this was in their parking garage. They tell us that they only have security 5 days a week and this happened while there was no one there. How ridiculous right? So we get no help from them cause they're POS. We can't have it towed because it's in a parking garage and the clearance is too low. We can't have it pulled out of the garage any other way so we have to call a tire place so we can pick out some tires and have them brought back to put on our vehicle. Let me tell you, this tire place went above and beyond. AMERICAN TIRE DEPOT! So amazing! They were making calls for us, giving us rides everywhere, even offered us donuts. We finally pick out our tires and rims and head back to the car. Guess what, the GD rims don't fit because the holes don't line up. The family is heated man let me tell you. So the only thing left to do get a rental car and call it a day. AMERICAN TIRE DEPOT hooked it up with a rental car! They tell us it will be a few hours but it ends up being longer than that so we have to get a hotel. In the meantime we went to Yardhouse(fav of mine) and had a late lunch. We checked into MAYA HOTEL - by DOUBLE TREE which is also amazing. Super beautiful! After a few hours of relaxing after a long and ridiculous day, the wife and I decide to order some CPmfK. I order the usual, Garlic Creme Fettucine, which is absolutely delicious. The wife orders a chicken Caesar salad because she wanted something light but she can eat what she wants because she is the most gorgeous being on the earth. We drive to pick this up by the way because we're tired after this long day and of course there's no parking. Fix that s-it CPK. Anyways, I go to pick it up and it smells great so I'm super excited. I get back to the car after my mile long walk since there's no parking and head home. We get back and look in the bag and THERE'S 0 bread. The best bread I've ever had is from CPK and they neglected to put any in our take out bag when we even asked ""will we get bread?"" and the lady responded, and I quote ""yes."" Now, normally this wouldn't be an issue but on today of all days I've had it. I'm sick of being deceived and lied to and this was the breaking point. I don't know what her name was but she was the messed up cherry on top of the poop cake. Don't get me wrong, the food was great, always is. However, after the day I had this place only gets 3 stars from me.

About 30 minutes passed and I did not have my order.  I asked the bartender if he could check on my salad and apparently the order had not been put in.  The manager told me he would rush the order.  15 minutes later I walked out because the order was still not ready. This is not the place you want to go to over lunch. It is routinely slow.  Two days ago I called in an order for a roasted vegetable salad.  I arrived 20 minutes later at the time I was told my order would be ready. I asked if I could eat the salad at the bar instead of taking it with me.  The bartender told me I could but the salad still took another 20 minutes.  Even then, the salad had no dressing which I had to make a further request for. Over the past two trips it has taken the restaurant about an hour and a half to get me one roasted veggie salad.  I come here because it's close to work and office staff gave me a gift card to the restaurant.  Even for free, it is not worth it.  Obviously I will not return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach?start=20,3.32,3.37,3.37,2.7880000000000003,3.35

I let him know he said our party's name, but before I could let him know we tried catching him before he walked outside, he condescendingly reprimanded me saying something along the lines of, ""If YOU HEAR your name being called, you need to actually SAY something."" Before I could even explain, he rudely turned/walked away to say the next party's name and another server was leading us to our table.  Our actual server was a nice and lovely woman but the aggressive introduction with Casey (we found out his name because he ended up being a server for a couple tables near us) honestly left a bad taste in our mouths.

Love coming here on Thursday or any day.  But tonight we needed to enjoy Friday Eve and CPK took really good care of us!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach,3.24,3.38,3.372,,3.3240000000000007

We waited an hour for our food. It only came out because I finally asked for the manager. Then POOF our food was ready! Shocker! Meanwhile, we used the restroom twice and it is the most disgusting place ever!! Paper everywhere, water leaking from each toilet, none of the stalls had toilet paper. Two out of three toilets were backed up. Disgusting. I told the manager and she simply smiled at me and said ""ok thank you."" Crazy customer service. I'm still sitting here. We have three children and they clearly have lost it for the last hour. Crying and wanting to go home. I'm right there with them. I want to go home too. If they don't bring my check in the next 5 minutes I will walk out of here. This is ridiculous. Save yourself some time and make your own pizza from scratch at home. It will be quicker. I promise.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach?start=20,3.24,3.34,3.368,,3.3000000000000007

Server (didn't get his name) had refills before we asked. Also, when ordering the carne asada pizza he said they didn't have carne asada but if we wanted to try it with Tri tip and that did the trick! The pizza experience was still amazing and everything we expected. Ordered butter cake and came out right on time. We'll be coming back.

2,Eriny R.,"Los Angeles, CA",335,147,292.0,2.0,2018-01-01,I came in with my family after watching Disney On Ice. The restaurant is local to the arena so it's understandable that they would be busy. Now we have experienced a few issues.  1. The host told us that the wait was going to be about 20 minutes. We checked around with other local restaurants and the wait was about the same so we decided to wait. We went to check in after 30 minutes of not being called and they said another 20 minutes to which we were furious because the kids were hungry.  2. We sat with the kids and ordered for them right away. We also ordered the waters for everyone. It seems like we got their pizzas an hour later :/ they were super hungry and started giving us a hard time  3. I ordered the steak which was the most expensive item on their menu. I ordered it medium and got it well. I gave it back and ordered the chicken and season veggies. The chicken was super dry and uneatiable. I was so disappointed. I finally order the classic Caesar which you really can't get wrong and it was good.  Overall I was very disappointed in this location. It seemed like everything that can go wrong did :/,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach,3.52,3.34,3.38,,3.4120000000000004
3,Jonathan G.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,1.0,1.0,2018-01-02,Been coming here for 10 years never had a bad experience from cpk the company alone but this location it's self was the worse experience ever I love this place I bring my daughter and order a kids pasta and pizza and the server has the nerve and try to tell me I can't order the two items because she thought it was for me and there is supposedly a 10 year and younger age to get the items then she had the worse attitude and rolled her eyes at me ! Managers in this location need to check there servers attitude and how they are supposed to have customer service on how they treat us as customers especially when we have are family here present !!   I can again new year 2018 and I get the worse service again and they took 35 min to give me my child's food and then the waiter just assumed that I didn't want anything and they still charge me for my kids meal,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach,3.52,3.31,3.376,,3.394
1,Lauren C.,"Los Angeles, CA",343,117,946.0,1.0,2018-01-04,"This is honestly the worst California Pizza Kitchen I've EVER been to. My family and I have been loyal customers of CPK for years at various locations. We keep coming back because we really enjoy their food, especially their pizzas. I have no complaints about the food here- it was great and tasted as it usually does. My main issue with this place was their poor customer service (or lack thereof). We walked in for a late lunch and everything was wrong from the very beginning. The host and hostess at the front were very unprofessional, incompetent, and not very friendly. Despite having 50% of the tables empty, they took awhile to seat us. When both of them finally decided to seat our party of 5 (because it is SO hard, right?), the solution they came up with was to put 2-two seater tables together (two chairs and a booth seat), which was clearly small for 5 adults. We didn't complain because we were just hungry. Right when we got seated, we felt rushed by the waitress to have our orders ready and then told her to give us a few minutes. I guess she must've felt annoyed because that's when the service went really downhill. She disappeared until we had to wave her down several times, slammed our dishes on the table when our dishes were ready, and spoke with an attitude. I guess she decided to get her act together later during our time there because she came back to refill our waters throughout the meal with a disingenuous facade of friendliness. I didn't appreciate her attitude, and this location was clearly all over the place, starting with the host and hostess. It is clear on their Yelp page that many Yelpers also experienced their poor customer service. I guess that can only be a reflection of their manager. I'm not tough about customer service; I really appreciate servers that are nice and we usually end up tipping them well. However, I can't stand rude employees, especially when our party has a lunch bill of close to $100. I expect better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-long-beach,3.36,3.31,3.364,,3.33

Polite, helpful, cheerful, listens and most of all its crazy because it's her first day. When you come here ask for service from Nicole.  This aside, I got the CARNE ASADA pizza and I would say it was a 5 out of 5. My wife ordered a shrimp scampi pizza that one is the way to go 5 out of 5. Beer was good, atmosphere was nice.
