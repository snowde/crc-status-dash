52,sylvia k.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,32,24.0,3.0,2012-03-01,"I came here last night with my sister and her boyfriend, STARVED and ready to enjoy dinner at a restaurant chain we usually enjoy very much: CPK. First of all, there is no sign outside of the Wells Fargo center so if it's your first time here, you will probably have a really difficult time finding it. We tried calling the restaurant multiple times to ask for directions but no one would pick up. After driving up and down Hope St. we finally just parked (it was about $4 an hour for street parking) and decided to walk into the Wells Fargo center to ask for directions. Lo and behold, it was up the stairs inside the building. We felt pretty stupid lol. So we walk in, and there is no host or anyone at the front to seat us. We stood there for a few minutes and a really friendly employee ran towards us and apologized for the wait and sat us at a table near the window. He told us a server would be with us in a minute. Fifteen minutes later, no server. So we flagged the guy who sat us down and got our drinks from him. Another ten minutes later, I got really frustrated and asked the manager if we could order. He was extremely friendly and started helping us, and at this time the waitress comes over and starts asking us if we'd like to order...in the middle of us talking and ordering from someone else. Wtf? We ordered our favorites: I got the Chicken Tequila Fettucine & Wedge Salad, my sister got the Kung Pao Spaghetti, and her boyfriend got the Chipotle Chicken Pizza. We also got the Avocado Club Eggrolls for an appetizer. The Kung Pao Spaghetti was a disgusting congealed mess and it looked like bloated worms on a plate. I tried a little bit and gagged, and my sister took a huge bite and spit it back out. It tasted....really bad. The sauce was not right and the noodles were very overcooked. We sent it back but thankfully everything else that came out was perfect and tasted great. Throughout the entire meal, our waitress forgot things we asked her to get for us such as extra napkins, drink refills, hot sauce, lime, and etc. We had to keep getting them from the manager. The entire time we were there, we were really friendly but for some reason the waitress kept avoiding us like the plague and forgetting our things. We even took turns getting up a few times to grab things such as napkins or plates because we were short on them. Even the waitress that was working another section of the restaurant in the way back came over and asked us if we needed anything. Our own waitress couldn't do that? At the end of our meal, the manager could tell we were not happy with our waitress (even though we didn't complain about her, he is either psychic or has a good eye) so he gave us 3 snickerdoodle cookies on the house which was really nice of him! If they just got rid of that one waitress, I'd have no problem coming back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-10?start=60,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.8600000000000003,3.0000000000000004

99,Jennifer C.,"Rowland Heights, CA",594,198,846.0,2.0,2012-06-24,"Never really been a fan of CPK. The only reason I would come here is for their tortilla soup, which is relatively easy to make. I honestly haven't been back in ages, but my cousin's graduation ceremony was right across the street at California Plaza so it was a convenient location for dinner. Let me just say... service really lacks here. It took a long time for our table's drink orders to arrive. I was excited to get their Italian cream sodas, but was later informed that they ran out of cream so they couldn't make it. What?? What a disappointment. It never looks good when a restaurant runs out of ingredients for something on their menu. Especially when it's something as simple as cream! I opted for a Raspberry Cooler instead, which was mediocre. We also clearly asked for sugar for coffee a million times, which also took wayyy longer than it should have. We got so frustrated that we actually got up to get it ourselves! HORRIBLE. Our waiter disappeared plenty of times for long periods. It wasn't even too busy, so there's no excuse for such bad service! I forgot how bad their complimentary bread is, too. It can only be described as stale and cold. It's like eating bread that was left out for too long. Thanks, but no thanks. Service didn't pick up until closing time when everyone was pretty much done with their food. Pretty pointless by then.

I worked as a restaurant manager myself for four years and it's rare to come across someone who genuinely cares about your experience and doesn't just drop the ball after listening to a complaint.

We came in yesterday for lunch.  M and I split the Morrocan Chicken Salad, which is chopped romaine tossed with dates, cranberries, avocado, almonds, chicken, beets and butternut squash in a champagne vinaigrette.  Perfect to split, this huge salad was not overly dressed and was packed with flavor from all of the unique ingredients and seasonings.  DH had the carnitas pizza, which was delicious.  The crust was fresh and crispy, the cheese was gooey and the meat was tender.  What more can you ask for?

You would think that would be enough to walk 3 blocks, get a table at CPK, eat, pay and walk back. Wrong. There is usually a long wait around lunch time here but we were fortunate enough to get seated right away today. It took a while before someone came to get our order. It took even longer for the food to come out. We had been there about 40 minutes before we got our food. The food was okay. We ordered the chipotle chicken pizza and the half Cobb salad. The half salads used to be really big but apparently they have reduced their portion. The salad is much smaller than I remembered and hardly worth it at almost $10. The pizza wasn't very good and there was an average of 2 little chicken cubes per slice. Sadly enough the best part of my meal was the mango iced tea. The server was also nice but there clearly wasn't enough people working for how busy they were.

Numerous times, this location has omitted elements of my order.  The worst was tonight.  As always, I provide the order to the phone operator and then ask that person to repeat it back to me.  We went through that process to get on the same page.  What do I end up with?  A basic marinara pasta.  Morons, go listen to the recorded order at around 7 PM tonight and tell me how what I ordered equates to a spaghetti marinara.  I will have no choice but to return to this place, but urge others to stay away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-10?start=100,2.96,2.96,2.96,3.0120000000000005,2.96

While most of my coworkers remain tired of their meals and lack of nearby late-night options, I come here for a decent cup of tortilla soup and sandwich. The sandwich isn't anything special. The bread is typically of a onion or garlic base, with tons of shredded iceberg lettuce that loves to fall out of the sandwich. The sandwich is poorly put together. It needs a wrap to keep it together. I typically opt for the chicken, and let me add there's nothing special with that either. It's rather bland, but clearly a healthy choice, unlike the bread. The tortilla soup is good and chunky, despite the high sodium. I find the soup to be better than neighboring options that Dan's Deli or Mendocino may offer. You just get more for your money here as well.  Parking isn't a great option around here. You can park at meters along Grand or Hope, and it's free after 8:00 p.m. Monday-Saturdays (free Sundays).

Fast and friendly service.

Then, the birthday girl had a couple of coupons - both of which the manager applied to the bill in addition to comping the 2 meals.  Lunch for 4 with tax came to about $24.  Of course we tipped 20% on the entire amount.  Frankly, I was embarrassed.  One of the ladies complained about the fact that they have recently switched from Pepsi to Coke.  YAY!!!

I was deciding between Chinatown and CPK and I picked CPK because of it's amazing views of the Downtown LA sky scrapers.  I felt like I was dining with the executives with their pricey suits, suitcases and admiring their professional demeanor. My waitress was very friendly and attentive to my whole dining experience.

They put bottled water on the table to entice customer to purchase bottled water. Table tops are dirty and sticky. Here's the bottom line:  There was nothing in this visit that was pleasant.  The service was not good or friendly, the food was cold, soggy and oily, the wine was not a good buy, the portions on everything were smaller and food pricing is high.  We will not be back to this or any other California Pizza Kitchen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-10?start=60,3.48,3.48,3.48,2.8840000000000003,3.4800000000000004

8,Rick K.,"West Covina, CA",0,101,91.0,4.0,2016-08-13,"Recently went here on a Sunday evening to meet family from out of town for dinner.  I used to work about three blocks from this CPK so I have been here a few times.  I called ahead to make a reservation.  The young lady that took my call curtly told me that they did not take reservations.  OK.  I then inquired about the parking.  In the past, I always walked to this restaurant and did not know about the parking.  Again, she was abrupt with her explanation about the parking.  I was beginning to have second thoughts about coming here. We met our party in front of the restaurant.  We were greeted immediately on going into the restaurant.  We were seated right away, given menus and our drink order taken.  Our drinks came right away and they brought us complimentary bread.   Our party ordered mainly salads.  I had the Jambalaya Fettuccine (Blackened chicken and shrimp, crawfish, Andouille sausage and Tasso ham in spicy Cajun sauce. My meal was pretty good.  Not too spicy but the sauce was a bit heavy.  My complaint would be my shrimp still had their tails on.  I DO NOT EAT SHRIMP TAILS AND I DO NOT WANT TAIL-ON SHRIMP IN A DISH.  It is a pain trying to get the tails off shrimp when it is buried in fettuccine.  When shrimp is served by itself, no problem if you leave the tails on.  Ok, rant over. Everyone seemed to enjoy their meals.  Our server stopped by from time to time to check on us and refill drinks.  Good service.  Happily, our server did not try to rush us out the door.  We had a nice, leisurely dinner. The noise level in this restaurant is usually pretty bad.  However, carrying on a conversation was fairly easy this evening.  When we got up to leave, I realized why.  There was hardly anyone in the restaurant when we left.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-10,3.32,3.31,3.31,,3.314
15,Karine B.,"Los Angeles, CA",29,165,8.0,4.0,2016-09-01,I would say this is a pretty legitimate restaurant.  I've eaten here countless times as I work very close and it's usually consistent.  Their spaghetti Bolognese is surprisingly good for being a chain restaurant.  It is better than pasta dishes I've eaten at some quaint Italian restaurants.  They are always busy and the staff is in control.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-10,3.4,3.33,3.33,,3.358

2,Jaime J.,"Riverside, CA",114,295,399.0,5.0,2016-09-27,"I've been to CPK's before and I'd rate them 3 or 4 stars had I used Yelp back then. This location however amazed me with their service! The waiter that took our orders is named Javier. Really cool guy! He started by recommending drinks while we looked through the menu. My mom and sister were in the mood for wine so we took him up on that recommendation. We tried the Sangria Flight and they were really good! The Beehive Sangria was the best in my opinion! The other appetizers were all delicious, and we really appreciated the generosity! Great way to start up the stomach engines. We contemplated ordering two pizzas but ended up ordering a full salad and one thin crust pizza. The Sicilian was delicious! We were full before we knew it! The food came out really fast! We felt well taken care of! By then we were being served by someone else since Javier had to leave. The waitress asked if we were interested in dessert and that's when my girlfriend remembered about her free birthday reward (that is, a free dessert excluding any ice cream). She brought out our Key Lime Pie (and deducted the cost from our check) and gave us some forks. The pie was amazing! It was nice and zesty. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit. Thank you CPK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-10,3.56,3.37,3.37,,3.446
1,Angela A.,"Riverside, CA",259,174,389.0,4.0,2016-09-29,"I really enjoyed my time at this CPK it is a great location with great service! Our server Javier was nice, funny, and attentive, so he definitely made it enjoyable for us! I came here with my boyfriend and his family and we were starving after walking around DTLA, so we ordered a bunch of food to share! Our server started us of with some recommendations and we and decided to order the recommend Sangria Flight! It comes with three different flavors and I enjoyed each one! My favorite was the Beehive Sangria, though. The alcohol was not strong at all and I would definitely want to order the full sized one after trying it out. For appetizers we ordered the White Corn Guacamole + Chips, the Brussels + Bacon Flatbread, the Crispy Mac 'N' Cheese, and a Full Classic Caesar Salad! That's a lot of food... the appetizers I enjoyed the most were the Brussels + Bacon Flatbread and the Crispy Mac 'N' Cheese! I was actually really surprised at home much I liked the flatbread because I usually don't like brussel sprouts, but I loved how they tasted with the bacon on the flatbread. As for the Crispy Mac 'N' Cheese I ALWAYS order it whenever I go to CPK because of how much I love mac 'n' cheese and they always taste so good! I hope they never get rid of it on their menu! We also ordered the Sicilian Crispy Thin Crust Pizza and it was really good! I've ordered it before at other CPK's and I always enjoy how it comes out!  At this point I was already really full, but then found out that I could redeem one free dessert because I am a CPK rewards member and it was my birthday this month! And I went through and redeemed the offer and ordered the Key Lime Pie, which only covers desserts for free without including ice cream. So, if you wanted to order a dessert that is offered with ice cream you would have to pay the extra if you wanted to include ice cream with it. Which to me is a bit weird, but whatever it's still a free dessert! The Key Lime Pie was really yummy, but I think I would have enjoyed it more if I wasn't so full, haha!  Glad we stopped by here to eat instead of hunting down the food trucks that we saw earlier in the day! I left full and happy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-10,3.68,3.37,3.37,,3.494

3,Randi K.,"Los Angeles, CA",481,85,3.0,5.0,2017-02-12,"I have been meaning to write a review on this place for years, as I have been a customer that long. I live and work in downtown LA. There are very few places in downtown to go to when you don't have food in the house, don't want to cook, don't have time to go to the gorcery store, and don't want to spend a fortune. (Most of the restaurants downtown are expensive). CPK on Hope Street fits the bill. This place is within walking distance of where I live and work. Not only is it convenient, but it is really my version of ""Cheers."" I often see my neighbors in this restaurant. Sometimes I join them when I see them. The waitresses know many of us, and we are all on a first name basis.  ""Everybody knows our names.""   Sometimes when I go in by myself, the waitresses will ask me where my other neighbors are, or if I have seen them. Sometimes when the waitresses have checked out, they will sit down at my table and join me for a conversation while I am eating.  One of the waitresses has been to my home for dinner. Others will be invited. So, not only does this place feel like home, but also the food is tasty, heathly and affordable. (They have salads and vegetarian dishes, as well as pasta and pizza's). Unfortuately, CPK on Hope Street will be closing down. Next Friday night, February 17, 2017, is their last night. I am really going to miss this place. I am going to miss seeing my neighbors there, and the people who work there. I am going to miss my version of ""Cheers."" Even though this location will be closing its doors, I just had to write a review of them before they are gone. Thanks to everyone who works there who have made many of us feel at home. You will all  be missed! I hope that most of us will keep in touch!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-10,3.52,3.37,3.37,,3.43
4,George A.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,6,,5.0,2017-02-17,"We just found out that this location is closing today. This is my family and friends favorite CPK location, over 20 years. We've driven two hours just to make it to this location even though there were others along the way. Out of all the CPK locations we've visited in California and other states, this is the best location when it comes to ambiance, food, and service. Our experience has always been great with the different managers and servers. Especially because this location has Javier.  Javier doesn't just take orders and brings food. He treats everyone as if they were family coming over to share a meal at his home. He's patient with large groups and children. Always suggesting appetizers and plates based on ingredients that you may or may not like. He'll say, ""next time you're here try the..."".  One time a group of women was sitting across from us and one of them ordered a bottle of her favorite wine. Her friends were surprised that Javier would remember to which the lady spoke highly of him. That's the level of service you'd only expect at a Morton's or Mastro's.  We're going to miss this location. Wish everyone and Javier the best.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-10,3.52,3.4,3.4,,3.4480000000000004

I found my need for shopping therapy and good food with a warm fuzzy feeling when I decided to eat at CPK. Darrin looked professional, clean and shaved.  I say this, because I see some service employees looking like they just got to work with a shower or a shave.  Thank you Darrin, your smile and service was sincere and good.  You see, when I walked in- I did not know what I wanted to eat... I left up to him... and they choice was awesome.
