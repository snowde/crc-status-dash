0,Vicky Z.,"Huntington Beach, CA",294,492,171,3.0,2012-01-03,"A two-hour delay + Gate change = Dinner at the airport and drafting session of a Yelp reviews on my iPhone $10 for a prepackaged Chinese chicken salad. I wanted to cry a bit when I handed the cashier my card. Sadly, the price was comparable to the other airport salad options.  The salad consisted of lettuce, crispy wontons, shredded carrots, sesame seeds, diced chicken breast, and a sesame dressing. I appreciated the chicken-to-lettuce ratio. I had about 1/3 leftover dressing. I guess avoidance of fast food guilt was worth the inflated price tag, although...French fries sound pretty good right about now.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-11,,,,,
2,Isaac Z.,"Fallbrook, CA",44,121,376,2.0,2012-02-20,"I know this is airport food and all, but the angry cholo guy working the register at CPK was doing just the bare minimum.  Lol. Customers were looking around for drinks, utensils, and napkins... He would motion with his eyebrows when they asked him for help. He used no words at all. Too funny!  10 bucks for a crappy cheese pizza. Only reason it got 2 stars was because it was hot. My advice is to just starve until you get on the plane. You can always eat endless peanuts after takeoff!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-11,,,,,
1,Angela M.,"Atlanta, GA",791,1752,1991,2.0,2012-02-27,"Let me preface this review by saying that I hate flying into/out of LAX.  I hate that there are such limited options once you're through security - CPK, McDonald's, and the ""mexican"" bar.   With that said, CPK is still my favorite place to eat in terminal 5.  $10 and 10 minutes for a personal pizza isn't all that bad, even if the staff isn't terribly friendly.  The prepackaged salads scare me since I'm not sure how long they've been sitting there and they don't look terribly appetizing, even when I've seen them with the lids off and all mixed up by other patrons. I like the selection of beverages - yay for Naked juices - even if they seem expensive even after accounting for the airport markup.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-11,,,,,
