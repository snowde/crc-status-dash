19,Christina S.,"West Los Angeles, CA",305,212,,4.0,2012-05-24,Pro Tip:  Use the To-Go window by the stairs to Lemonade.  You can get the prepackaged salads there (I find the chicken caesar to be a particularly good deal) as well as the sandwiches and a few other menu offerings.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-12,,,,,
21,Chris M.,"Los Angeles, CA",74,193,4.0,3.0,2012-08-31,"It's a CPK.... inside USC. It's good, but if you're in a hurry I suggest ordering a salad or ready-made pizza. Pricey, but good. Nothing special, but perhaps less likely to offer you a date with the toilet than some other options on campus.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-12?start=20,,,,,
13,Dahlia S.,"Palo Alto, CA",910,655,541.0,4.0,2012-11-15,Why does this CPK have bad reviews? During lunchtime they have 4 BBQ pizzas ready at any given time and 1-2 of everything else. Every single time I've been here all the pizzas are a perfect golden brown. I have mad respect for Chris Dewolfe for opening the first CPK on a university campus at his alma mater :),https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-12,,,,,
20,Caitlin S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,22,,5.0,2013-01-30,"My favorite restaurant in the Campus Center.  Everything they sell is delicious.  My favorites are their Chicken Tortilla Soup, Mac and Cheese, and BBQ Chicken Pizza. Their soup is the best deal its pretty large and only $2.79",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-12?start=20,,,,,
12,Greg S.,"West Lafayette, IN",26,20,,5.0,2013-01-31,"California Pizza Kitchen is amazing!  I love being able to stop by the middle of campus and pick up a delicious pizza.   My favorite pizza there is the BBQ chicken pizza - it's awesome.  Also, they have pasta, soup, salad, and sandwiches, so if you're not in the mood for pizza, they still have some great options.   In addition to the food being great, the people who work there are always nice and friendly.  I would suggest stopping by if you are ever on campus.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-12,,,,,
18,Sam F.,"Denver, CO",120,1048,619.0,3.0,2013-02-05,"Another restaurant in the ""food court"" of the USC Campus Center. CPK usually racks up a huge line pretty quick for lunch so be careful. I don't like their pastas but the pizzas are pretty good, my favorite is the BBQ Chicken! It can be a bit pricey but at least you can use your USC student card. Once you order you have to awkwardly wait to the side until your order comes out so that's kind of annoying. But at least we have a CPK on campus!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-12,,,,,
17,Zack S.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",439,69,113.0,3.0,2013-04-06,"The location on campus has recently pre-made pizzas sitting our for a very quick bite to grab before class.  For campus food and something so quick and decently good, its overall a nice bite to have.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-12,,,,,
9,Kelley L.,"Long Beach, CA",24,430,463.0,4.0,2013-04-13,"A typical California Pizza Kitchen, but at the University of Southern California. Go around 1pm to skip the lunchtime traffic. The wait for food is not too bad (maybe 5 minutes, max). Pizzas are good. The macaroni and cheese with bacon was good. Not really sure what there is to complain about. Also, show your USC ID card to skip taxes. (:",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-12,,,,,
0,Michael K.,"Los Angeles, CA",578,272,43.0,5.0,2013-05-15,They now have the Sun Dried Tomato and Broccolini fusilli. It's as bomb as the other pastas! I've been here at least 30 times this year...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-12,,,,,
6,Mark S.,"Lakewood, CA",1421,291,1047.0,3.0,2013-10-09,"This CPK is located inside the Tutor Center food court. The facilities here are really nice, and you're surrounded by primarily undergrads that are on break between classes. Food 4/5 Standard CPK quality pizzas and salads.  I like that most pizzas are made to order.....probably because they sell so quickly. I've never had the sandwiches, but it's not California Sandwich Kitchen so I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything. Ambience 3/5 It gets loud in here.  Trying to eat and study in this place is overwhelming.  Don't plan on doing any serious reading if you're eating here.  If you don't mind the noise then you're good here. Decor 4/5 It's neat in the Tutor Center.  Lots of white tables and white walls, giving an overall modern feel to the place. Service 3/5 Good enough for CPK in my eyes. Overall 3/5 If someone were to ask me about CPK at USC, I'd say, ""It's alright"".  It is, but don't expect a five star meal between classes or before your exams.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-12,,,,,
16,Josh C.,"Los Angeles, CA",444,380,16.0,3.0,2014-02-10,This CPK location in the Tutor Campus Center has massive issues when it comes to the lunch rush from around 12-2pm.  Every time I've tried to come here they've had me wait upwards of 10 minutes in line because they run out of pizzas - they try to do their best in getting everyone food but the rate at which they cook is just way too slow for their own good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-12,,,,,
5,Kate B.,"Los Angeles, CA",497,370,218.0,2.0,2014-10-23,"MMM BBQ CHICKEN PIZZA!  That's what keeps me coming back to this place. Honestly, I feel like there aren't any good spots to eat on campus, and this is one of the better places. What kills me about this place is the wait! During lunch, you could easily wait 10-15 minutes for the pizzas to be baked. If you are on the run, this is probably not the place to eat. It is funny how it is Express CPK, but not really express.  It is a good deal though, the lunch combo is $6.99 for half salad and half pizza!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-12,,,,,
8,L H.,"Los Angeles, CA",139,127,28.0,3.0,2015-04-13,"As anywhere in the Tutor Campus Center during midday, the line is quite long. Use the Tapingo app to order via your phone & pick up w/in 10 minutes usually.  I don't recommend the Mac n cheese -- tasty enough for half the portion then it seemed unappealing--too fakey cheesy or something--to finish.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-12,,,,,
10,Melissa K.,"Los Angeles, CA",15,87,26.0,3.0,2015-04-27,Watch out for the grumpy old lady here - she will make u whatever she wants and when u tell her thats not what u ordered shell be sure to throw your actual order in your face,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-12,,,,,
3,Marie X.,"Albuquerque, NM",1,77,256.0,3.0,2015-08-11,"Came here during USC campus visit in mid-aug. Thought we'd try the on-campus food court.       Getting thru line was on slow side.  All 3 of us ordered the Duo Special with half a small pizza and a Caesar salad.  Price was good, under $7, but the bbq chicken pizza was pretty bad. I like it at the actual CPK restaurants, but this was dry and tasteless, except for the chunks of chicken.  Salad was decent and I did like the shaved parmesan.      Difficult to find a place to sit inside. Must a madhouse during the school year.  Also had to leave area for a restroom.         Overall, I wish we would have traveled the 5 miles from USC's campus to eat at Phillipe's French Dip sandwiches!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-12,,,,,
2,Cindy C.,"Los Angeles, CA",503,181,677.0,3.0,2015-10-30,"An express CPK inside USC.  Their menu options are limited and altered to fit students. The most popular student choice would probably be the half pizza half salad for ~$6.50, but just note that the pizzas are pre-made, so you can't really modify your pizza (like ask for no cilantro/onions etc). A full pizza here is like in between a regular pizza and kid's pizza at a real CPK, it's enough to fill up one person perfectly. They also have various pasta options here, my favorite is the chicken tequila fettuccine. The salads are all pre-made in the morning, so if they don't have any left, that's too bad.  They're really slow at serving during lunch/dinner rush hour... they try to give everyone a number but just end up getting confused. My number was skipped a couple of times since they kept forgetting about me. During rush hour, I would probably go over to Panda since they're faster and more efficient, but CPK is a good choice apart from those times.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-12,,,,,
7,Paul S.,"Long Beach, CA",28,606,20.0,1.0,2015-10-31,"I have never been a fan of CPK.  If you see me there, it's because I'm with someone with a bland palate that has chosen this as a place to eat.  After having almost everything on their menu, my opinion remains un-detoured.  I've given them enough money, and I don't plan on giving them anymore.  Say ""NO"" to CPK!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-12,,,,,
4,JJ A.,"San Francisco, CA",46,214,57.0,1.0,2016-11-30,"Service is terrible. It's a reliable choice at the campus center cafeteria, but the people working the counter move at snail's pace. This is especially true in the evening.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-12,,,,,
1,Florence H.,"Monterey Park, CA",553,174,421.0,3.0,2017-05-09,"This is on campus and practically one of the better places to grab lunch. The menu options are very limited however, portion sizes are perfect for one person. I usually get the half pizza duo (BBQ Chicken) or the chicken tequila. Those were my favorites for the past years at USC. I've been here at least 50 times since I started school here and after all this time, I still haven't gotten tired of it. For those saying that service is terrible. What do you expect from a express CPK and from a school? The point is to order your food and eat until you're satisfied.  3/5 because sometimes its not too consistent and sometimes not fresh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-12,,,,,
