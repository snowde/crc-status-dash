I just ate here on my lunch break, it was virtually empty yet took 40 minutes for my chicken sandwich, which leads me to believe the chef kept tripping on the abundance of pygmy warriors they use to hunt the chickens, they hate their job, or they just trying to keep the white man down... the sandwich was the bomb though, or if I was in an airplane, ""it was really good""...

209,Chris F.,"San Fernando Valley, CA",120,55,11.0,3.0,2012-04-13,At 3:30pm this place had 6 tables taken and 2 waiters. And it took 5 minutes to seat us. They tell us to sit anywhere and we do but we didnt get menus. Another 5 minutes go by as we watch the waiter/waitress charge the bills for the tables that are ready to pay. We get the menus and are ready to order but our waitress is running around making drinks and charging more tables. Looking around you can see that the other tables are waiting for one thing or another. Service is real slow here.

Service is okay. The prices were meh, could be a dollar lower and I'd be okay with it. One plus though were the free refills. Between the two of us, we ordered one mango italian soda ($3).

In my opinion, this location is smaller than others; however, they are twice as slow! Why?! What's the hold up?! First time, the hostess entirely forgot about my party (thanks!) and told us we'd have to wait another 40 minutes because she forgot. Other times, it's just plain SLOW SERVICE. I don't mind a wait, but it's the part when you're seated.. and you wait.. and wait.. and wait.  I worked in food service for a short while; I know it's not glamorous but c'mon - there's paying customers present.

First of all, a lot of the people who come here during lunch are UCLA employees (me included) we only get an hour lunch, so it's pretty important that we get in and out quickly.  It's almost impossible to get out of there fast enough. When we go, we always have to make sure we get there at 11:30 to avoid the wave of nooners that come in.  The food? Ehh, alright.

171,J M.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,173,7.0,3.0,2012-05-25,"The food was pretty good, its just that service was excruciatingly slow. We were sitted really quickly probably due to some mistake - there was a wait list but the hostess sat us down anyway after looking around the restaurant. Star for that. We sat around waiting... waiting... the waiter finally came and we just ordered everything at once because they were taking a long time to get to us. I ordered bbq chicken pizza, the works, fresh green salad and the tri colour salad pizza. I liked the works - tasted like pizzas I ate in Korea before. Tri colour salad pizza is basically a salad on top of thin pizza crackers - it was REALLY chewy, oddly so. Maybe they over cooked it?? The salad never came - we didn't really ask about it because the salad pizza was pretty much like a salad by itself. I asked for the check after we were done and the check included the salad so we told them we never received it. They told us that it was JUST done being prepared - what? how can a salad take longer than 3 pizzas to be prepared?? We said we just wanted it off of our tab because we were done with our meal. They just gave us the salad anyway (star for that) we had to wait a long time for the fixed check, to go box, etc. We wanted to empty the table for them since it was a full house but man they are REALLY slow...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-16?start=180,2.84,2.84,2.84,2.7,2.84
218,Bethy R.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,2.0,2012-06-30,"My friend and I decided to see Magic Mike tonight so we stopped in to eat at CPK. We were seated very fast in a booth seat. And our waiter was nice but very awkward. This wasn't the problem though.... I went to get up and go to the bathroom and asked one of the ladies working there where the bathroom was. Very quietly without even a whisper replies ""the right over there"" without any direction to where ""there"" was. So I asked again to clarify that it was back against the back wall of the restaurant and in a very distraught way she says, ""yes ma'am"".  1. Dont call me ""ma'am"". I'm 18 yrs old. 2. Speak up so I can hear you 3. Dont give me attitude I'm a paying customer Im only asking where the bathroom is.... So I sit down with my friend and tell her about what happened and we were just kind of like wow wtf... So then the lady walks by and I flag her down because I needed some more water I was very thirsty. So I ask and say, ""Excuse me ma'am can I have some more water?""  Well the look she gave me was absolutely rude and disgusting. Not only that my water never came she purposely walked by with the water pitcher and it was full and never attempted to look at me or poor water into my glass. Its like after I called her ma'am she suddenly too became offended  but actually made sure I saw that, but the difference was she was like 30 something and I'm 18 you call me ""miss"" and I call you ""ma'am"". So we waited and waited and it became like a joke cause she never came with the water so I asked some waiter guy for water and it was there right away.  They werent busy. She wasn't busy. This was absolutely uncalled for and someone needs to talk to that hostess lady.... Seriously.

It reminds me of the Cheesecake Factory, except CPK isn't as nice and the service is a total downgrade.  Regardless, I can't help but devour their baby clam linguini (white sauce is tons yummier than red sauce) and their signature bbq chicken salad. I actually dislike the whole bbq chicken aspect of it -- everything except it is awesome. That dressing can't be good for you but damn. That salad is amazing.

193,Tim C.,"Santa Clara, CA",257,18,,5.0,2012-09-10,"I find myself at this location often and the food and service is always great. The cuisine here is more innovative than authentic, but they do the classics very well so i really don't see a problem in either regard. More often than not, the door is opened for me upon approach and a pleasant dining experience always ensues.  I've been a fan of CPK for many years and have thoroughly bounced around the menu, which has much for everyone. I personally am a HUGE fan of the ""Sicilian"" pizza which I pair with an ice cold Guinness. When in mood for pasta, I order the ""Fettuccine with Garlic Cream Sauce"" with chicken and sauteed mushrooms (you can also order this with shrimp). For $1 you can order a side of  delicious, hot, watch-the-butter-as-it-melts, pita bread (which is what I do alternatively to having the house bread brought out).  I'm here on a weekly basis and am genuinely surprised at some of these reviews. Even the rare, more inexperienced waiters here stay busy, make small talk and smile. What more can you ask for when casually dining? I also don't  understand how you could slam an Italian-style restaurant with a 1 star rant-of-a-review because of the ""Chinese Chicken Salad,"" which isn't even half bad. And yes, it's busy during peak lunch hour and if you get there late enough you're obviously going to have to wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-16?start=160,2.76,2.76,2.76,2.9640000000000004,2.76

My sister had the candied peach salad, which she liked. The peaches were a little soggy for we taste. My mother had the tortilla soup , which was delicious.  The bad- we shared the chips and guacamole as an appetizer. Our waitress, Terri asked us if we wanted bread and we said yes. She walked away, just as we were about to cancel the appetizer order. We figured we'd tell her when she came with our drinks. She returned and we asked if we could cancel it, but she said it was too late. Really? Then she said, well I asked if you wanted bread and you said yes. We told her how we tried to flag her down before but she had walked away so quickly. Since she did not offer a solution, we left it at that. The rest of our visit was tense and awkward. She was standoffish. This is the first time that I haven't had a positive experience here. Usually, everyone is so nice and goes above and beyond. I was very disappointed. A simple apology would have been just fine.

I ordered the Shrimp Scampi Zucchini Fettuccine as one of their new adventures items. In my opinion, it had a tad too much zucchini and too little fettuccine. The cook was very generous with the shrimps though and I was very happy since I'm a big fan of them. The sauce was creamy and I like it a lot.

CPK calls the nasty white centers of lettuce hearts a salad? With dressing so minimal... I could not have told the difference between what I got and a ""100-calorie only!"" sized rip-off for lunch.  And the strawberry lemonade - CPK, your competitor down the street at least gives it a full-hearted attempt by adding (or better yet! making it with) REAL strawberry or something that at least is authentic enough to contain strawberry seeds. At CPK, you'll pay for what seems to be high fructose-ey Minute Maid lemonade mixed with some other yucky excuse for the strawberry component. Again, a disappointment.  On the plus side, the service this time was much better. I can for sure confirm that I will not be returning to this CPK again, much less any other.

What I ordered:  Crispy Mac n' Cheese:  Fried and covered with cheese, it can't be that bad right? WRONG. Even my bf cringed upon eating these and he has pretty much no standards when it comes to fried foods. For the price you pay, you'd at the very least expect house made mac n' cheese. These might as well have come from a box, cause that's what it tasted like.  Avocado Club Spring Rolls- For something called an AVOCADO spring roll, there was maybe a couple slivers of avocado, at best. Not worth the price. Skin was soggy not crispy. If you're having a hankering for fried avocado rolls, go to BJ's Brewery. They have avocado spring rolls stuffed with avocado for half the price. The rolls here are absolute jokes.

After coming back for an anniversary dinner with my boyfriend to celebrate where we had our first date we had a horrible experience. I feel like CPK is going down hill.  We came in during dinner service, which we were sited in the very back. Hostess smiled and sat us down but felt like we were hauled like cattle. The waiter greeted us and asked if were ready - typical start of to any dine in restaurant. My boyfriend asked for any suggestions, the waiter responded by pointing at the menu and said ""here"" throwing the menu back at him.  We could tell he wanted to take our order and leave. Did not feel welcomed at all.  Food was ok, sad that the miso salad I normally ordered was no longer on the menu. The cobb salad my boyfriend ordered was not appealing at all. It was not tossed and it looked like it was just thrown on the plate - gross. I mean, salad is the easiest to prepare. It doesn't take that long to make it look good. The waiter never came back only til after we finished everything and 15 min and more waiting for him. We were completely ignored the entire time.  Normally I tip well because I also work in the food industry, so I know how hard it is to deal with customers and handling/juggling everything. But this is the first time I had to not tip! I will no longer be coming to this CPK. Sad.  Note: We also overheard that the waiter couldn't wait to quit since he already had a job interview and was waiting for a call back. Most likely affected his service to us since it showed he no longer cared. Hopefully he gets his act together if he still is with CPK.

The few times that I've been to KPC, I've gotten a medium, one topping pizza for about $15... and it's the size of a small. Like most Americans, I like my portions big and my prices cheap.

The dp was really good, but I wish they would use better chips, which to me, were a bit stale. The pasta was good, but they alfredo was just a tad too clumpy for my taste. The flavors on the pizza was good, but I really couldn't find any difference between the old dough and the new ""hand toss"" dough. Finally the dessert.  Originally I was going to get the key lime pie. I'm a suckered for a good key lime, but our server suggested that we get the butter cake instead. At this point the hostess chimed in and said it was the best thing the served. Our interest was peaked, so we ordered it. This was the saving grace of the evening. Before the dessert came out I'd ordered a glass of resling and it just wasn't right the would night. It tasted like a dry chardonnay, which I don't like. The resling I ordered was a favorite of mine, but it didn't taste right, even when they opened a new bottle for me. So the fact that the butter cake was so awesome, I forgive the bad wine.

As expected then, the area was crowded, the streets were blocked, and parking was a nightmare. But I digress. CPK was filled with people, but we had reserved a table for seven. No wait, and the drinks and orders were accomplished relatively quickly. We ordered 4 pizzas (Hawaiian,  Mushroom-Pepperoni, Thai, and BBQ Chicken, I think), two salads (mixed greens with cranberries, walnuts,  and feta cheese and a Chinese chicken-like one. I don't exactly remember), and for me carnitas tacos. The tacos were surprisingly good. The pork had been fried, so it was at once crispy and tender. Had no regrets for adding avocados for an extra 99 cents. As for the rest of the food, I only had the cranberry walnut salad, but I enjoyed the taste of the balsamic vinaigrette and feta cheese, although CPK could have cut down on the amount of dressing. Had a slice of all 4 pizzas; my favorite would have to be the BBQ chicken. I found the Mushroom-Pepperoni too greasy and salty.

The bread was good, the dipping oil for the bread was nice, and the pizza was ""okay."" I do feel like the restaurant was extremely overpriced for what I got. I want to reiterate that these are very thin, single serving pizzas that any grown person will finish in one sitting, so don't expect leftovers.  To be more specific, let's take the mushroom pizza I ordered today for example.  I honestly wouldn't call it any tastier than a mushroom pizza at say Papa John's, and that truffle oil is certainly overrated. The mushrooms are chopped pretty tiny-like so you don't really get the great texture that you could get when it's prepared whole, and a pizza that's basically just mushrooms, cheese, and bread is a little bit lacking in my opinion. I left paying $18 (including tip) for my wild mushroom pizza + truffle oil, and I would consider it an extremely large price for what I got.

However, the last time I came I really enjoyed the selection of food my colleagues and I decided to share.  First, I highly recommend the BBQ Chicken Salad. It is soooo good and filling. You will not feel bad after eating this and the half size is perfect for lunch.  This particular visit, I shared this salad with three other women. It was perfect because we also shared a pizza. I was skeptical at first about our pizza choice but once I tried the Gorgonzola-Pear Pizza I was hooked! It was sooooo delicious. There's almost a salad right on top of it that you eat with the pizza. It's just perfect!  If you want to try an out of the ordinary kind of pizza, try this one for sure.

I tried a pasta in the ""Lite Adventures"" list and got the shrimp scampi zucchini fettuccine last night and really liked it. It was a good mix of veggies and light sauce. It was just enough food! I am definitely getting this again.  I like CPK because it offers good vegetarian options.

There was a time in life when I absolutely loved CPK, but they basically faded into irrelevancy over the last few years. Now they've updated their look with a softer, farm-to-table feel and added some cool, upscale items to their already solid menu. We had their Valentine's special which was 1 app, 1 full salad, 1 pizza, and a dessert for $32! I calculated it saved at least $10, which I used to buy a craft cocktail made with avocado (the new ""in"" mixer apparently). Everything was delicious! Even their new bread and olive oil to start is good - fresh and warm! Spinach & artichoke dip can't help but make you feel good all over, though some of our group preferred having bread with it rather than the chips with which it's served. Our server happily brought plenty of extra bread. The Thai salad is hearty and flavorful. I think the pizza crust has been re-worked to be more Neapolitan, it seems to me. It was thin in the middle, puffy on the edges, and had nice structure with a little char. What can I say about the butter cake with ice cream - it's just the most sinful of indulgences.

I've seen in countless restaurants the sign that says that workers must wash their hands BEFORE leaving the restroom.  If there is a regulation requiring this, then CPK in Westwood is not following it.  I don't care if these servers are Hollywood types or not. They should obey the law just like everyone else. To the tall blond buy serving in CPK, wash your hands BEFORE you leave the restroom.  If you want to wash them again when you get to the work area, that's fine.  There is no substitute for washing them in the restroom... and you just came out of the sh*!ter.  Ouch!

Sauce is flavorful, but they didn't put enough of it on the noodles so the dish is dry.  Garlic cream fettuccine - nothing spectacular, but it isn't bad.  Kung pao spaghetti -  like!

When I met my friend at the table, she already had a water, but it took awhile for me to be greeted for my first round of drinks.

My friend and I both had the ""Blood Orange Sangria"" and I thought that this was really good. It wasn't overly sweet and tasted fresh.  The bread and olive oil is good that they bring in the beginning. For my dinner, I had the full ""Thai Crunch"" Salad (crisp veggies, cilantro, chicken, peanuts, wontons, rice sticks, peanut thai dressing) and I added the avocado. I thought that this salad was quite good. The ingredients were fresh and it had nice flavor with a solid large portion. However, for what it was I felt it was on the pricier side (~$20 after the added avocado). For dessert we tried the ""Salted Caramel Pudding"" (caramel pudding, black cocoa cookie crumbs, whipped cream, caramel sauce and sea salt), which was delicious! It was a pretty unique dessert, wasn't overly sweet, and had a great balance of flavors. We were celebrating my friend's birthday, so they put a candle on it and made it nice.  During our dinner, a rather sketchy character stood by our table and talked/raised his voice at us.

I also like how they do not season their herb olive oil mixture they use for the dipping sauce for the bread. This allows the customer to put as much salt and pepper into it as they want. Also their baked potato soup is pretty good. I like how many bacon pieces they put in the soup. They are quite large and really give the soup a bacony flavor. The potato's are soft and melt in your mouth. Also the broth is thick and creamy and tastes really good. I like the addition of the scallions in the soup as it adds to the flavor. But the soup is very heavy due to the cream and bacon. I think it could be lightened up if parsley was added to the soup. It would add a freshness and lightness to the soup counteracting the heaviness of the bacon and cream.

I did not recall that and I have had both.  The chicken was not only dry, it was way over cooked and hard on top.  I don't know if he told them not to put garlic sauce on top , which I did not ask him to do, only no additional salt.  There was very little of the lemon garlic sauce and maybe that is why the chicken was tough and dry.  I only ate half and took the other half home.  I just warmed it but no, I am not eating it.  Tough, dry and over cooked.  The veggies were fine.  I did not send my meal back because my friend and I had tickets for the Geffen to see a play and I did not have time to wait.

There are a good amount of good menu choices. Salads are pretty good. Chinese Chicken Salad tasted really good except the chicken wasn't fresh which is a turn off. Sandwiches, not a fan of. I don't think the soups are made fresh either. Service varies. The last time we went, the waiter was quite rude. Didn't respect the time we needed to order & was rude about it. Food was not too appetizing.  Mine was good, I got a Chinese chicken salad. However, the chicken was cold ensuring it was not freshly grilled.. Lots of the stuff is not that fresh.

CPK is like the class I took at UCLA only because it fulfilled my ""Scientific Inquiry"" requirement and because it was only a three minute walk from my last class--walking stinks, am I right? CPK is like the brown napkins the fast food restaurants sometimes have that is kind of coarse when you run it across your mouth but it's better than nothing. CPK is like the friend who hyped up a hangout for months but ends up just hitting me up to ""walk to the laundry room together"". CPK is like the show that comes on after Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune. CPK is like the realization that you want to buy the fancy $3.99 hand-made pasta at Ralph's imported from Italy but can't necessarily justify the cost and instead settle for the $1 Kroger version. CPK is like the jeans you really like but get shrunk in the wash so it is really hard to put on again but you know you just gotta lose a few pounds and you'll be able to squeeze in and stretch it out to somewhat normal size. CPK is like when you're on a roll and making some great jokes to your friend on Messenger and they just respond with ""lol"" and ""haha yeah"" and that annoying thumbs up emoji. CPK is like when you are totally for saving the environment but still feel greatly inconvenienced not getting free plastic bags at the store and then realize you're sort of a bad person but hey, at least you're well-meaning. CPK is like when you go to the car wash that you always go to since it's good and cheap at just $8 for a premium wash, but then you realize they raised the price up to $9 and you're bummed but that's still a decent deal and you're already there so you might as well still go through with it. CPK is like when a club on campus promises ""free food"" at a meeting and you convince your friend to go and they end up running out of the one pizza they ordered and you feel rude so you have to stay and you feel guilty because your friend is texting and isn't making eye contact with you.

My dad and I went for dinner earlier this evening.  We were seated at a 4-person table, just the two of us, which was nice to have extra room. There was a stack of 4 plates on our table, ready for us to use, with wrapped silverware neatly on top. As we grabbed plates off the stack, we both noticed each one was very obviously dirty. Normally I don't check things like this too closely (maybe I should), but in this case there was physical food and food stains stuck to all 4 plates. We wiped some of the stains off the 2 cleanest looking plates and used those because we normally don't like to be a pain. Then, when we got our waters, mine had something floating it. It was relatively small and looked like a piece of food or something. Again, I decided not to bother complaining, pushed it to the side, and just stuck with my wine. Then, and here's the kicker... as my dad was almost finished eating his pasta dish, he found a shrimp tail in it (yes, just the tail). This is especially gross considering that the dish he ordered does not have any shrimp in it (he got the wild mushroom strozzapreti). He showed the waitress, and she said ""oh, wow, that's not supposed to be there."" She took the plate away, and the manager came over to apologize, saying ""we have so many pans going back there, it must have flung out of one of the shrimp pans and landed in the pasta"".  Oh great... now we feel much better...  Anyway, since they had already run my credit card before we noticed the shrimp tail, she offered a gift card worth the price of his dish. Thanks, I guess? Needless to say we won't be using it at this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-16?start=40,2.96,3.33,3.33,2.6600000000000006,3.182

Parking structure across the way and several metered parking spots on the streets.  Food is ok for a vegetarian. But not a lot of options for a vegan. Food is a bit above average from my vegetarian point of view.  I tried the soups and they were really great soups. If you like peas, I would recommend the pea and barley soup. It's beautiful made.   Pizza is nice and crispy and not too greasy.  Pasta, they customized it to fit my finances liking and let me tell you, it was perfect.  I always get the peach sweet tea and it's equally balanced to not be too sweet. It's my favorite.  First my fiancé and I were greeted and seated, being that it wasn't busy. Since he is still sick, he felt nauseous and I walked up to a waitress who right away got me a brown bag and used a plastic bag to line the inside for him to vomit in. She then goes back to the kitchen to get us water, and not just a glass of water but a bottled one. She was such a sweetheart. The part that I forgot to mention was that she was on her break, because I interrupted her while she was eating. I found out her name was Leticia.  She is primarily the reason why I decided to come back with my kids and mother along with the fiancé. That same week we went and we're hoping to have Leticia as our waitress, but lucked out.  It was a really busy day and full house both in and outdoor. Although the host wasn't as friendly or fast to seat us we managed to find a spot outside. Our food wasn't fast to come out either as the first time around but the store manager Kelly was quick to come out and greet and meet the guests. She had such a beautiful aura surrounding her. Her smile said it all and the way she talked to us, especially my fiancé and kids. She cheered for his recovery and welcomed him to the restaurant and said if he needed anything that she would be there. She was a complete stranger but the many times she walked up to our table or helped the waitress bring the food or drinks, she felt like a friend. She said if my fiancé felt to sick to stop by that they delivered to the hospital and even gave us her business card along with 2 cards for a free small plate.

44,Caroline s.,"Beverly Hills, CA",15,134,90.0,3.0,2017-12-23,"They have remolded this place and updated the menu which is a huge plus. A couple of things that I was kind of disappointed with is that the lettuce wraps  don't have the option of adding white meat chicken , only dark meat chicken. Also the Arnold Palmer did not have much lemonade, it was basically just iced tea. The portions are very generous. The lettuce wrap, although an appetizer, is the size of an entree and very filling . The half size salads are pretty big and filling too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-16,3.44,3.26,3.292,,3.3320000000000003
