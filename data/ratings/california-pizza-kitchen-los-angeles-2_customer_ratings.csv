115,Milton H.,"Washington, DC",616,126,520.0,4.0,2012-07-15,CPK is not exactly the most trendy LA restaurant but the menu has really been upgraded. I had a sufficiently filling caramelized peaches and chicken salad with a light vinaigrette dressing. Really really good. My wife got the spinach and artichoke pizza....crust was nice and thin and very tasty. My teen got the Kung Pao spaghetti with shrimp and loved every noodle of it. My oldest teen got the classic BBQ chicken pizza. I removed the cheese and nibbled on it and as with my last CPK visit it was exceptionally good. The service was great---my tweens thoug the server was a movie star because of his eye color (whatever)...but everybody in LA looks like this don't they??

Because they run their employees ragged and spread them way too thin in order to keep costs down. They also train them to look, act and serve like replicants from planet douchebag. This location was especially bad because of the neverending stream of shoppers coming down from the mall, stressing everyone out to no end. I feel like these kinds of places are for people who have never really eaten in a good restaurant before.

Kinda sad, that CPK would be it, but EVERYTHING always tastes so good here.  Been going to CPK ever since I was little and my mom and I would stop here right after a long day of shopping. So this past weekend we ordered the fried macaroni and cheese, white pizza (my first time trying it), and full bbq chicken chopped salad. It was all delicious. My friend and I basically finished everything except for a slice of pizza and some scraps here and there.  CPK, even though you're a franchise, you still serve one of the best stuff out there!

Free lunch and wine = excellent!  CPK serves decent food, even if it isn't my first choice here in LA.   Yup, my girl friends and I were there on that Sunday in March when a bomb scare shut down the entire Beverly Center.  Luckily, we managed to enjoy our lunch and conversation before all the craziness started.  We started with an app of the Tuscan Hummus with whole wheat pita.  Not bad!  I liked that they give you plenty of pita, so you probably won't have to ask for more.  Since the other girls were indulging, I also ordered one of the new Adventurous wine flights, which had two reds (can't remember which) and a Moscato.  I like variety, so the flight is a fun way to try a few sips of multiple wines.  For my entree, I had the Waldorf Chicken salad: grapes, green apples, candied walnuts, crisp celery, field greens, and Gorgonzola tossed with housemade Dijon balsamic vinaigrette.  It was fairly generous and fresh, but I really wanted more flavor.  I kept adding salt and pepper.  And just as we all finished our meal... the manager came over to tell us that we had to leave.  No, not just us, everyone.  The building was being evacuated.  And that was our meal.   On a funny note, I found a kindred spirit in my friend Emily, when we both confessed that the idea of standing there and chugging our wine before leaving had crossed our minds.  Oh well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-2?start=40,3.48,3.48,3.48,2.9240000000000004,3.4800000000000004

We had to ask multiple times for items they forgot to serve, and then had to wait at least ten minutes for drink refills, and almost 15 minutes for 4 children's sundaes. In trying to make up for the terrible experience they gave us a coupon for a free entree. So yesterday I went back in with my wife and son. I told them I had a coupon and the manager came over and said I'm sorry you had a bad experience last time we will take great care of you today.  Well that was a huge lie.  We asked for bread 3 times!! It took nearly 15 minutes to get that. They brought out food for my wife and I , however it took 7-10 more minutes before they brought out my sons pizza.

12,Denise L.,"Santa Clara, CA",971,2329,3799.0,4.0,2013-09-06,"With a toddler and hot weather, CPK seemed like the best choice for a family friendly restaurant. Smallest CPK I have been to, but service was excellent. My friend and I can drink tons of diet coke, and he kept them flowing all throughout our meal. Had the chicken lettuce wraps which were delicious and they even provided us with extra lettuce when we ran out quicker than the chicken. My all time favorite pizza here is the Garlic Chicken, but they got rid of it. I asked the hostess if they had something similar, and she said no. I started perusing the menu and decided on a pizza but when I looked at the front cover, it had a sticker introducing the new and improved garlic chicken pizza. Odd that she didn't even know about it. It was slightly different but still friggin delicious. Their bread has also changed where it's not old stale slices of sourdough bread with butter on the side but hot out of the oven chunks of sourdough with the olive oil/vinegar dip. For dessert we had their famous butter cake with ice cream and the salted caramel pudding. The butter cake was AMAZING! We devoured the moist and warm butter cake (reminds me of pound cake) but with perfect crisp around the edges. The salted caramel pudding is good, but got way too much chunks of salt at the end.

In a little over five days I visited the location three times and overall I'm very happy with the experiences. I had a few different dishes throughout the visits and each was equally good, with the least favourite being the hand tossed pizza (the breaded chicken with arugula takes the top spot for me, followed by the crunchy thin crust marguerita pizza).  Desserts were also good and decent sized. What made this place stand out though was the great service provided by the waiters and the hosts. Not only were they very efficient but they also seemed to have a genuine interest in my satisfaction (either that or they'll be really good actors one day!). :D I'll definitely come back to visit in future trips.

The pear gargonzola pie - which I don't even know if it's on the menu anymore - its a homerun and I'm sure a slice will pass before my mind's eye in my dying moments on earth.  It doesn't matter if they still do have it - i love a place who switches it up and gives you more options.   I also love a place where you can sip cheap white wine and eat pizza at the same time.  Ayyy! classy guy over here.  It's starting to feel a little 80s/90s though in it's decor.  I wish they could do something to make it feel less like a chain.  And hey - knock it off with those ugly pizza box paintings - or get some real artists to do them.  They look schlocky and make me less hungry.   Red Velvet cake - 100% yes yes yes!!!  I just made icing in my pants thinking about this!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-2?start=60,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.8600000000000003,3.2000000000000006

However, there are always a couple of tables open and with just a party of 2, it is very easy to be seated quickly. It is also a convenient location so that after eating a filling lunch/dinner, you can walk it off at the Beverly Center or at the plaza across the street.  The food here is the same as at any other CPK. Some dishes are pretty good and some are okay. I used to like the sandwiches here, but ever since they changed the bread to ciabatta bread, which isn't really my favorite kind of bread, it no longer tastes the same. However, their tortilla soup is delicious! It's a bit sweet and tasty. My boyfriend really likes their four cheese ravioli which is tasty as well and comes with your choice of mushrooms.

Pear and Gorgonzola  - I liked this pie, it's different-it's like salad meets pie. Caramelized pears add a little bit of sweetness, gorgonzola cheese was crumbly and has a salty bite and walnuts were a nice crunchy surprise! Spinach and Artichoke   pie is a nice concept, but gets soggy, fast.  Ingredients are not skimpy by any means, there was plenty on both pies.  Peach lemonade   was tasty, but just a tad heavy on the syrup for my taste. After a few sips I gave up on it and went for a cold brew, goes better with pie anyway. Our server was so nice, upbeat and suggested items on menu. We had a nice dining experience, resturant was tidey, but Im not hooked on their food, I'm just not a CPK fan.

We were never given or even offered bread and wasn't given any until we asked for it. My mom's order was still missing halfway into the meal and when we asked, we were told it was almost ready. 10 minutes later, it still hadn't arrived so we inquired about it again. We were then told it will be right out. My mom ended up eating off of everyone else's plates while waiting. Another 5-10 minutes later, the rest of us were already done with our meals so we asked for the order to be cancelled. Our server told us it was about to be brought out. We told her we were done with our dinner and that the order obviously wasn't placed at the same time as the others, but by her 15-20 minutes ago. She tried to make it seem like she couldn't cancel the order but we told her she should've told us it was never placed to begin with, instead of lying to us and then inputting the order when we were more than halfway through our meal. No sincere apology was given. We spoke with the manager, Apres, who was also rude and unapologetic. Had a ""I don't care; don't want to be here"" attitude. She just told us that it was removed from the bill. Very rude and unprofessional, especially in front of her own staff. Whatever happened to leading by example? Such poor customer service from a manager.

However, yesterday (7/10/15), I had a horrible waitress that ruined my lunch. I'm an avid tea drinker and order it most of the time when I'm eating out. As we sat down, I ordered the hot tea. Usually, they bring a small tea pot of hot water with a small plate that has honey, couple of lemon slices, and an UNOPENED tea bag. May I know why my waitress brought a single cup of tea with a tea bag that she took upon herself to open and dunked it. By the time she got to my table, my tea was PITCH BLACK and bitter. Who does that?! How do I know it wasn't someone else's tea?! Very sanitary. Also, I had to stir my drink with a fork as no spoons were brought over. Thanks?! We had ordered the cobb pizza and the wild mushroom. I asked for thin crust on both and received only one pizza with the thin crust. The pizzas were good but I wish we got what we had ordered. I let it go because we were with a child and I didn't want to wait any longer. Lastly, once we got our check, we paid with cash and the waitress just ASSUMED it was her tip in there as well so she never brought the change back. Once again, WHO DOES THAT?!

The Kung Pao Spaghetti was lacking in chicken pieces; usually there is a good amount, this is the first time there were only bits and pieces. I didn't complain because service was bad enough and just wanted to eat and get out. While eating another lady sat by herself and was waiting and waiting and waiting for her server, she sat at the table next to ours. She looked around and gave this exasperated look. I spoke to her and said we are having a bad experience too, waited 10 min to be acknowledged, and I am not leaving a tip.

However, the Jambalaya pasta is a different story. The noodle is under-cook and still hard to chew. I'm 35 years old and my mouth was getting tire from chewing. I don't know if any of you have ever put so much chili on a dish that it no longer taste spicy but you get that strong bitter taste instead? Well, this is what happen with the pasta, the cook put extremely a lot of spices that made it taste so bitter. Took the pasta home and after putting all the effort of re-cooking that dish, it still has that strong spice flavor that it won't go away. I ended up trowing that dish to the trash.

So we had 2 small pizzas, beer and soda. = $50.  On a good side, pretty good staff and great cute place to relax or maybe to have a date.   P.S went to Chinese restaurant after, because we were still hungry lol",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-2,2.84,3.05,3.05,,2.9659999999999997
