But seriously now, I mean, c'mon, I get that sometimes things like that happen, BUT, what really disturbed me was their answer. An answer that sounded like they were trained to say it. Now i'm paraphrasing, but it kind of went like this. ""Well, i'm very sorry about that, but it's not as uncommon as you think. Since we don't use foods with pesticides, occassionally there are small bugs that remain on the food."" WOW!!! This was said by both the waitress and the restaurant manager!

106,Johnson G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,299,198.0,2.0,2012-09-08,"I previously reviewed the Arcadia location and gave it 5 stars. That was before this ""reinvention"" that has apparently happened chain-wide. Came here for a lunch with co-workers, about 18 of us.  Service was good, though I notice that the servers are wearing t-shirts with various descriptions of menu items or slogans.  I don't think these kinds of t-shirts belong at a full-service restaurant.  I think they're better suited for grocery stores or fast food chains, but not for CPK. The starter bread came out, and it looked - and tasted - nothing like the sourdough loaves I've come to know.  This was plain white bread. It tasted boring.  I shouldn't even have bothered with the oil and balsamic vinegar - it was a waste of oil and balsamic vinegar. The menu has been down-sized, certainly in the pizza section. And see my picture of one of the display messages at the table.  Sure seems like they want to stick with what they want to serve, not necessarily what you want to have. Lunch: I had the California Club pizza on honey-wheat crust.  I shouldn't have strayed from original crust.  My supervisor wasn't happy with her Thai Chicken pizza.  She complained the carrots, typically baked with the pizza, were now raw and tough. I lament that this experience has soured me and my other co-workers.  We may not be going back here.

Had they not stuffed us in a quiet corner like vended animals, it might have been different. The food, however, was actually pretty good.

220,Brittany B.,"Los Angeles, CA",165,221,69.0,4.0,2012-09-20,"CPK, in being universally well-liked and so commercially successful, carries with it a certain mark of manufactured casual dining, terrible-for-you, boring unsophistication that I would normally not be willing to admit I enjoy. Too bad, world - judge away, I love CPK. Sure, their restaurants all look the same, they serve a mishmash of ""safe"" and boring foods disguised as eclectic, but there is a lot to be said for their consistency. I try my best to glaze over the mandated nutritional information listed on the menu because the food, in general, is terrible for you...but  - damn. Many a varied and gourmet meal later, and after all these years trying to deny it, CPK still tastes as good as it did when it was when it was the best option in the cheesy outdoor mall of the suburban Los Angeles city I grew up in. I never get pizza here, but I like the BBQ chicken chopped  salad, the roasted vegetable salad and, for the love of all things good and holy in the world, that divine chicken tequila fettuccine. The chicken fettuccine is a great tasting way to eat a 3,000 calories in one sitting. Speaking of calories, I also enjoy their spinach/artichoke dip and and red sangria.  The service I've experienced at this particular location has been a bit slow and inattentive, frustrating because the business lunch crowd is eating on borrowed time on weekdays.

I'm not the biggest fan of CPK since it's a large chain restaurant but this experience was probably my best..

It was the perfect portion for one person cuz their regular salads are humongous.. I also had a few bites of the chimichurri chicken which had really tasty bites of sauteed cauliflower [: My favorite item off their menu during this trip was definitely the mango mojito!

I would come back here for the drinks alone! 2 margaritas, 2 mojitos, 2 half portion salads, and the chimichurri chicken rang our bill up to a steep $70..

It seem like they just threw the sandwiches together  with no concern on how it would taste. DO NOT ORDER THE CHICKEN SANDWICHES! I also ordered a soda, which the waiter did not come around to refill when clearly it was empty when bringing our food; I thought that was unprofessional. After such a horrible experience we really just wanted to leave but of course we couldnt even do that! We had been given the bill ( much faster than recieving any of our foods or drinks ) and after we were ready for the waiter to come pick it up the waiter ended not showing up again after 25 min!

However, we had not been here for over a few years.  So, several weeks ago, my husband brought our daughter and I here to celebrate our birthdays.  Thomas was our server and he was superb!  He was extremely professional and contagiously friendly.  He really took our dining experience light years beyond our expectations.  There were four of us in our party and Thomas took our orders flawlessly without needing to write down a thing.  Initially, my husband questioned Thomas on his method of not writing the orders down and he gladly offered to write them down if we'd like...my husband then said to him, ""by all means carry on with your means of order taking.""  He politely continued, and upon completion he repeated our orders back to us perfectly! He then hand delivered each of our meals personally; we truly appreciated this because you hardly see this practiced anymore. When a waiter personally brings you your meal (instead of having someone else deliver it for them) they stay in control of their guests dining experience.   Thomas was not only efficient he also anticipated our every need. When he saw that I had covered my hot plate of pasta with a napkin to keep it warm, he asked if he could take it back to the kitchen and redeliver it when I was ready to have it. I have covered my plate scores of times in the past at other restaurants (not just at CPK's) and Thomas was the only one to ever offer this service to me. It is because of Thomas that we had such a pleasurable dining experience during our visit that night...he created such a wonderful environment for us because of the ""excellent service"" he provided.  And because of that he was our main topic of conversation all the way back to our home and we live about a half hour from this CPK location. We would like to thank the upper management for choosing Thomas to work with the company...CPK is fortunate to have him...he is golden; he is the type of employee that employers dream about...take good care of him.

Last time was more inviting and the service was awesome, however, today wasn't as I expected.     First reason, the ambiance was wrong. It doesn't look as inviting as it used to be. But that one is not really problem. One problem I noticed is the service. The server came to us asking us if we been to this restaurant before WITHOUT introducing his name. I also notice that we didn't get serve a garlic bread when most of the tables served seem to have one. Last one is, as we hand out the check with our payment, the server asked ""Would you like your change""? I used to work in a restaurant and this isn't the way I approach my guest. The proper way to is to tell them that ""I'll be right back with your change"". I honestly think the server we had seems to have no experienced on food service.     Overall, we felt that our experience wasn't satisfying and inviting.

For some reason, the garlic chicken pizza is no longer on the menu at any of the CPK locations, but they will make it for you. Their spaghetti bolognese is one of my favorite pastas and their chicken piccata comes in a strong second with the perfect cream sauce. If you sign up for their CPK card, you accumulate points every time you dine there which you can use toward getting free appetizers.

CPK was chosen more for the location and convenience (parking validation, kid friendlier than the other 7th/Fig options) than for the food.  I didn't expect much of the food, so I can't say I was disappointed exactly, although I love food so it always saddens me when I don't particularly enjoy my meal. I ordered a half portion of the roasted veggie salad, which comes with avocado, artichokes, red and yellow bell peppers, sun dried tomatoes, eggplant, and roasted corn tossed with romaine lettuce and a Dijon vinaigrette. Sounds good, right? In execution, it was nothing like the description or, might I add, the picture online (that I'm looking at as I write this). The romaine lettuce wasn't fresh; instead of being crisp, it was soft and on the verge of wilting. The vegetables were probably overcooked; most were pretty soft and the salad overall just seemed soggy. The free bread was the best part of my meal. Our waitress was attentive, checking up on us throughout the meal. I did get tired of the repeated attempts (probably mandated by management) to sell us extras like drinks, appetizers, and desserts. I think we were asked twice about dessert.

He assured me that it was not chicken. So, I spoke with the manager who was just as confident. Finally, a third time, after checking with the kitchen to find there was no fake chicken here, they agreed that I had been chowing down on bird.  They did offer me another dish for free.

130,Zoe B.,"Pasadena, CA",0,7,,1.0,2015-07-14,"Shame on CPK! I have never been so disgusted in my entire life. There are no words to describe the feeling that I have right now towards this company. I cannot imagine myself eating here again.  A few of us were recently at this particular location and we decided to sit at the bar. I am so glad that we decided to sit there, because now I know who the people are that cook the food for this restaurant. Let me start off by saying that I am a proud Mexican-American. I work near this location, so I have been coming to this CPK for a little over a year now. Make no mistake though, I will never eat at ANY CPK location anymore. I cannot believe that they hire such disgusting people to work for them. On this day, I was the only woman in our group who spoke Spanish fluently so I was the only person who could understand what was being said between the restaurant staff. Thank goodness for that, because the people that I was with would not tolerate what happened on this day. If they understood the words that were exchanged between the staff, they would of raised hell.  So, after a few minutes of sitting down, I heard someone cursing in Spanish. I kid you not, I heard every foul word in the dictionary. I was shocked. I started to listen closely and found that the kitchen staff (mostly the men) laughing about someone's private area and cursing extremely loud. I don't know if they were drunk, but they sounded like they were all intoxicated. I heard the cooks in the kitchen say things that would just blow my mind away. I cannot begin to tell you how bad the words were. I couldn't hear clearly as to exactly what the story was, but the way they were speaking was absolutely unacceptable. It was ridiculous. I haven't heard that kind of Spanish and foul language in years. The funny thing is that the cooks were shouting so loud that I could hear them all the way at the bar where we were all sitting. Thankfully, they were speaking Spanish, but the words that they were using were so bad that I had to tell our group what was going on. I couldn't eat the food that was put on the counter. I couldn't hold myself anymore. All I could hear were curse words and the staff laughing like hyenas. (Which was the most annoying laugh I ever heard) Once I told my friends what the cooks were saying, I noticed that they were extremely disappointed and I knew that they wanted to leave just as much as I did.  At this point, we were all upset and just listening to the kitchen staff shout and laugh, while hearing curse words in Spanish. Can you imagine this at a restaurant? The interesting part about all of this was that the young girls who were working at the take out area were hearing all of this. I could see them coming by the bar and looking as if they were embarrassed. The cooks didn't care that there were women around them. They kept going...There was one girl that I caught laughing along with the cooks which shocked me even more. I am sorry, but I do NOT want these type of people cooking my food. It's just bad energy in that kitchen. It is disgusting to cook while cursing and talking about a woman's private area. That is just wrong in so many ways. I wouldn't even want to be in the same room as someone like that, let alone let them cook my food. The staff in kitchen was just unbelievably disgusting. Shame on the managers for condoning this type of behavior. At one point, I even saw the manager go to the kitchen, hear them cursing and talking about inappropriate things, and literally giggled and walked away.  My goodness, if the people inside that restaurant knew who was cooking their food, and what they were talking about while cooking it, they wouldn't eat there anymore.

The service is over the top and tried to hard to seem ""caring"". The worst part was that they kept forgetting what I asked for such as a fork or a refill(which took 15 minutes). Also, they do not offer validation. Not that this is an issue, because its a separate matter. However, the waiter who served acted as there was validation and even stamped it. When I exit, the fee pops out at 3$. I'm confused and have to walk all the way back to the restaurant only to discover they didn't offer validation. I ask to them why they even took my ticket then?

Did not enjoy my DINNER at all...We paid $63 including 15% tip. The waiter never once consider taking the plates from the appetizers, it was crowding the space of our table, if it wasn't because I mention it to her, she was not attentive at all.  The ladies bathroom is completely gross, it looks like they do not clean the toilets, empty their trash, or clean their disgusting walls. I cannot imagine what type of Hygiene they have when  cooking my meals.  This place seemed pretty empty for Saturday evening, its no coincidence because this place is run so unprofessional, there employees reflect poor manners and service. For dessert I ordered a regretful Red Velvet that was completely disgusting! It tasted extremely OLD from being refrigerated. Not impressed by anything at all.

The food was good, and you can ask for cheese if you order a pasta and would like more cheese and they have chili flakes for their spice but I guess it was more so for my friend who had ordered a pizza...The one thing that I thought was weird was how my fettucinie noodles were green and they were also a little more chewier than I would have liked, but that could just be because of the way that I normally cook my noodles. Why they didn't get 5 stars?

Food: I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps, Jamaican jerk pizza, kung pao spaghetti, and the crispy mac and cheese appetizer.  Besides the appetizer, I've gotten the other three items before and generally like them a lot. The lettuce wraps were good as always here, but the pizza was undercooked, making a thin crust pizza chewy and cold in some areas. The pasta was absolutely dreadful for some reason and everything just tasted wrong. The appetizer was not actually normal mac and cheese but actually small balls of mac and cheese that were fried. It had the worst texture, were not even hot (for a fried item) and tasted like nothing.  Service: Our server was good and upbeat. However... there was a small flyer on the table showing that if we signed up for a CPK rewards account, we would get a free small plate. So I asked the server about it and he confirmed that we could order a free small plate. I signed up on my phone and showed him everything on my phone to which he again verified that everything looked good and that we could get our free small plate. We got the mac and cheese described above, and even though it was pretty disappointing, we were fine with it because it was free. At the end of our dinner, the server came to us saying that there was some kind of error in the system and that we were going to be charged for the small plate. I told him that the only reason why we even ordered that dish was because he verified for us multiple times that it would be free and the flyer on the table even showed so. He said that he couldn't do anything and charged us the $5-6 for 4 cold, small balls of tasteless mac and cheese. We left without saying anything else because it wasn't a big deal.

The waiter was obviously peeved we asked the hostess for him. I asked for another drink which another waiter brought the drink to our table, took my mother in laws half full drink, gave her my drink and I sat and waited for 15 minutes before we asked the bus boy for a drink because our waiter told us to give home a minute and he never returned. Decided to use the restroom as we waited for the check and the restroom had obviously not be cleaned. The floors were dirty, toilet paper and paper towels scattered all over the floors and the walls had not be cleaned probably ever. Gross! Disgusting !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-4?start=20,2.48,2.98,3.084,,2.7800000000000002

43,Bill B.,"South El Monte, CA",638,409,2442.0,4.0,2017-12-16,"Visiting this location for the first time, there is ample parking all around this huge shopping area. However this business does not validate parking at any of those locations. This is a smaller venue however the service staff and the greeter are excellent. Food came out very fast. My wife ordered soup and salad. The chicken tortilla soup and chicken Caesar salad or both fresh and very tasty. The wings that we ordered his appetizers were excellent as well. I ordered salmon which was prepared perfectly along with some steamed vegetables. The prices are above average. The restrooms had an average level of cleanliness. It was too cold eat outside that night but I do like the availability of outside seating when the weather is warmer. I know next time in downtown Los Angeles we will definitely return",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-4,2.72,2.99,3.096,,2.8820000000000006

44,Isabel P.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",5,22,14.0,5.0,2017-12-26,"I ordered the Fire-Grilled Ribeye, the steak was Medium well, as I normally enjoy it. It was paired with a side of potatoes, and lemon garlic arugula salad. The steak was very well seasoned. The potatoes were soft and crisp, and the salad was a good balance. The steak was rather big so be prepared to spend some time devouring this meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-4,2.96,3.03,3.12,,3.002
48,Rachel M.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,2,,2.0,2017-12-29,"The hostess: NATALIE, who works at this particular CPK is RUDE!!!!! I love CPK don't get me wrong. But I will NoT tolerate NEGATIVE attitude from servers. She had the audacity to sit my family near the restroom!!! Nooooooo, like my family and I got to the restaurant and I went to the ladies. As soon as I left the restroom I found them seated outside the ladies I was like nope!! So I walk to the hostess and kindly request her to change our seating and she gives me an attitude. To be a server is not easy but you need to have courtesy and NATALIE, the short lady was just rolling her eyes at me and was hesitant to listen to my request. I know about great customer service, so do NOT try me NATALIE, if you can't be kind get another job where you don't need to speak or see people!!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-4,2.96,3.04,3.116,,3.0080000000000005
