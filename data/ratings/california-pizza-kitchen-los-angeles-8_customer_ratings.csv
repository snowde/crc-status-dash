0,Ralph P.,"Buena Park, CA",1545,184,845.0,2.0,2012-02-11,"If you have been to a CPK restaurant outside of an airport, don't make the mistake of thinking this airport CPK is anywhere even remotely as good a the full service locations. Â The $10 personal pizzas are not much different than the cardboard they come in. Toppings are minuscule and beyond skimpy in their rationing of anything other than stale dough. The clerk at the register spoke in some unintelligible arab dialect outside of Damascus. A little English or Spanish might be appropriate for LAX!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-8?start=20,1.88,1.88,1.88,,1.88

I feel like every time I go they run out of the pizza I am craving, and this was yet again the case when I traveled on Friday night. I ended up getting a sandwich, which wasn't bad, but I made the mistake of eating half and putting the other half back in the container, only to have it accidentally dropped by the jerk next to me who merely picked it up and apologized. That was my dinner dude, next time, pay me half of what that sandwich cost since you dropped it. If you are starving at the airport, try it, otherwise if you can, go to the actual restaurant. Love the artichoke dip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-los-angeles-8,1.84,1.84,1.84,,1.8400000000000003
