38,Anthony S.,"Louisville, KY",0,11,1.0,4.0,2012-04-12,"We love California Pizza Kitchen's food. They always offer consistent quality with their dishes so when you order, you know you won't be disappointed. I have never ordered something that I didn't love. This place has a very unique and eclectic menu and it always hits the spot. The only down side to CPK is your experience totally depends on the server and service is completely hit and miss. You may have to wait 10 minutes for a refill depending on who your server is. The last time we were there my wife didn't finish her dinner because she planned to have desert. Not only did the server NOT offer us desert, he didn't say a word as he did a fly by drop off of our check. They missed out on sales, (I wanted a beverage from the bar for desert) and disappointed us. The other negative side of CPK is the noise level can get pretty loud. I have often wondered why they haven't installed noise reduction panels. It sounds like a soup kitchen during dinner rush! Their price is above what I would like to pay for their atmosphere and hit and miss service and the soup kitchen noise level but like I said, the food is great!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-louisville?start=40,3.152,3.152,3.152,3.152,3.152
32,Shal V.,"Louisville, KY",32,192,47.0,5.0,2012-06-01,"I usually avoid chain restaurants like the plague but one night when I was sauntering through the mall absolutely famished, I decided to eschew the predictable, run-of-the-mill eateries that are permanent fixtures in malls across the country, and give CPK a try. I tried the thin crust Jamaican  Jerk Chicken (Jerk chicken, spicy sweet Caribbean sauce, Mozzarella, applewood smoked bacon, onions, bell peppers and scallions) and Habanero Carnitas (Slow-roasted pulled pork, red onions, cilantro pesto, Mozzarella and Queso Quesadilla cheese with spicy habanero salsa). Both were absolutely scrumptious, especially the Habanero Carnitas if you crave something spicy and a bit different from what you usually find at pizza places. They serve it with a habanero-based dipping sauce which is also wonderful! I'm just salivating while writing this review. I went back a couple of times and enjoyed the food and service each time. I highly recommend CPK!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-louisville?start=40,3.2520000000000002,3.2520000000000002,3.2520000000000002,3.2520000000000002,3.2520000000000007

The pizzas are good, and I am a fan of the BBQ chicken pizza, but I get serious cravings for the Thai Crunch salad.  This is one of my favorite main course salads from any restaurant.  I also love most of the appetizers, particularly the Sesame Ginger Chicken Dumplings.

On my most recent visit, CPK provided the affordable and better-than-food-court meal that my friend and I craved. We were immediately given a table upon entering the restaurant -- no wait required. The server was attentive and helpful.  We ended up splitting a Hawaiian pizza, which was ample for the two of us. Yet it didn't set us back much more than $7 each.

This is one of the few restaurants that I can order the same thing every time I go and it never lets me down. The Thai crunch chicken salad is probably my favorite salads anywhere and although people normally come here for the pizza, I make sure I always get this salad too. The half size portion is enough for two people and they give you the option to add avocado for two extra dollars and believe me, you must add it to this already delicious salad. Moving on to the pizza-- they have thick and thin crusts and a variety of kinds of pizza to choose from that are plenty enough to feed two. I normally get the 'Works' (which has a ton of meats) or the 'California Club' (which is the pizza version of the thai chicken salad) but if you want plain ol' pepperoni, it is delicious too.

It wasn't a tailgater pre-meal, not the gargantuan McThis or O'That appetizer meant to be split between 4 hearty overeaters, but a delicately portioned and presented pre-meal teaser. Many won't like that, but we appreciated that the appetizer, split between the two of us, left room for the pizza when it arrived. We really came for the pizza, and it didn't disappoint. The thin crust was very well made: pastry-like and crispy, flavorful in itself. The toppings merged reasonably, the sauce, cheese and ingredients. It was PIZZA pizza. Light, but not a handful of uncooked ingredients on a wafer. As to other factors in the experience, the waiter was friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. When we asked to build our own pizza topping -- which manifestly is not the format of this place -- without missing a beat, he helped us work out a custom pizza by finding an existing pizza with most the toppings we wanted, and adding an extra topping. He was unflappable and never lapsed into the ""these pests"" eye-roll you will experience in many restaurants. We weren't being difficult. But we know we did step just off the path.

19,Craig U.,"Lexington, KY",148,309,858.0,4.0,2016-01-09,"So I recently watched a Cooking Network show about the History of Pizza.  It was interesting because it would seem that more of the untraditional pizza toppings actually originated at the California Pizza Kitchen (particularly BBQ chicken pizza).  I'm sure it was all very exciting, but the time has come when most of these pizzas are available elsewhere.  Does it still hold up? The decor was very modern, I believe remodeled from its original style.  Looking over the menu, the focus really seems to be off the pizza... But they have some very interesting and inventive other entrees... Anything from Kung Pao Spaghetti to Chicken Caesar Salad.  Lots of both traditional and fusion food combinations.  My wife and I decided to try their Ancho Chicken Pizza, with black beans, roasted corn, salsa, and chicken seasoned with ancho chiles.  Not as spicy as we expected, but very good regardless.  And very filling, surprisingly, for just a 10-inch pizza. The crust was pretty much perfect... Oven-fired, crisp, plenty of bite.  A little expensive for that small of a pizza at $13.49, but still a great experience. I will also say that the service there was EXCELLENT.  I never saw my glass approach even half-way being empty.  And I'm a heavy drinker (of sweet tea, that is).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-louisville,3.44,3.44,3.44,,3.4400000000000004

I received quick service and was quickly served up an ice cold beer.  They had a number of lunch specials on the board however I settled for the Thai salad to go along with my absolutely freezing cold beer.

8,Lauren H.,"Louisville, KY",166,290,384.0,2.0,2016-01-25,"CPK is super ""blah"" to me. An overpriced chain restaurant that serves mediocre food. I was so disappointed that I wasted the calories and money on a meal here, but I've learned my lesson. We ended up here on a Saturday night after being quoted a wait time elsewhere. I tend to be impatient and usually don't wait for a seat at restaurants. Most important lesson learned: just wait. By the time you get to another restaurant, you could've already been seated at the first one.  CPK serves pizzas, pastas, and other specialties. The choices are pretty typical, and for a place with ""pizza"" in the name, there aren't many creative or unique options. I decided to go with a pizza with the hope that it would be decent since it's in their namesake. The pizzas are around $15 each for an individual size (11-12 inches), thin crust and baked in an open flame oven. I compare the size, thinness of crust, and cooking style to Blaze. The difference is Blaze is half the price, tastes infinitely better, and has unlimited toppings of your choice.  My pizza (pepperoni, sausage, mushroom) came out. The pizza looked good enough. The mushrooms were piled high, though the other toppings were pretty minimal. However, it didn't taste near as good as it looked. The toppings were not flavorful. The pizza was severely under-sauced. Just blah.  For me, CPK is a two star restaurant because of their overpriced, subpar food. Not a place I plan on frequenting again.

My husband and I went to CPK for lunch today and enjoyed it.  I had the soup and salad lunch special (farmers market soup and Caesar salad with grilled shrimp). I love that soup! It has such and a good flavor, not too sweet. The Caesar salad is very good especially with the addition of the shrimp (not on the menu as a choice but they will always make that for me).  My husband got the pizza and soup lunch. He had the sausage mushroom pizza and the tortilla soup. Both good!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-louisville,3.36,3.36,3.36,,3.3600000000000003
42,Kayla P.,"Louisville, KY",49,11,37.0,4.0,2016-10-14,I do like them menu they have lots of new artistry pizzas. They looked super good minus the fact they had no non-meat options. They drink menu was very impressive for both alcohol and non alcohol items. My only complaint would be the prices. I ordered my pasta and a lemonade and it was $18 I did not feel the value was worth it. Good food just over priced,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-louisville?start=20,3.36,3.36,3.36,,3.3600000000000003

Nothing over the yop or unique, but its their signature and never dissappoints.

15,Bobby B.,"Greenville, IN",292,21,33.0,5.0,2017-01-17,California Pizza Kitchen always has some great menu items.

9,Heather M.,"Louisville, KY",28,44,25.0,4.0,2017-01-20,This place is really good but its way too expensive.   We only come once a year because of the price.  I would recommend it if you are okay with spending about $50 for a pizza dinner but they do have more options yen pizza.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-louisville,3.64,3.64,3.64,,3.6400000000000006

3,Angel G.,"Fort Knox, KY",6,41,22.0,5.0,2017-03-20,I'm not sure how I haven't come across this place any sooner! So happy to see that there is a CPK located in Louisville! The restaurant is nestled right next to Dicks Sporting Goods at Oxmore Mall. You can park right across from it and enter in through the outside.  The service was great and the food even better! We went with their classic BBQ Chicken Pizza and tried it with the wheat crust option. Awesome!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-louisville,3.76,3.76,3.76,,3.76

41,Jo M.,"Louisville, KY",0,12,1.0,1.0,2017-05-03,"I usually have a great dining experience.  Not this time. My husband and I left the Highlands /Bardstown Rd on a Wednesday evening, and drive to the Oxmoor Mall to CPK for a change of scenery. I ordered the spinach artichoke pizza.  When it arrives it was not prepared like described in the menu. It did not have the spinach dip layer foundation, and it had no cheese.  I told my server, and he was indifferent about it.  I asked if this is how they normally make it. And he would not answer. So I just sent it back and said never mind. I would rather not eat than accept bad quality food.  So I ate nothing while my husband are his meal. A good restaurant manager would NEVER have let me leave without eating.  A good server would have brought the food back made correctly.  A good food prepared would have made it correctly the first time.  Shame on you CPK!  And I'm a pizza rewards member!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-louisville?start=20,3.6,3.6,3.6,,3.6000000000000005

Our server (I THINK her name was Ally. She had pink flowers on her name tag) was wonderful and attentive. She suggested cauliflower BBQ ""wings"" as an appetizer and came up with a dairy free sauce for me to use for dipping. I ordered the banh mi bowl and it was delicious and a HUGE portion. The flavors were competing with each other a bit, but overall it was lovely.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-louisville,3.6,3.6,3.6,,3.6000000000000005
4,Yolanda B.,"Birmingham, AL",2,14,23.0,4.0,2017-06-15,"CPK is good, as usual. Nothing extravagant or a ""must-have"" however it's filling and certain foods are perfect for my tastebuds.  I ordered my usual spinach and artichoke (add chicken) thin crust pizza, roasted veggie salad, and a butter cake. I really like the roasted veggie salad and highly recommend it. If you're interested in adding almost 1000 calories to your consumption, try the warm butter cake. It's pretty good!  Overall, CPK is a quick and easy grab for food that you know will always taste the same...no matter where you go. It's still, in my opinion, a bit pricey for what we're receiving but I appreciate the hassle-free environment, sipping and chatting while waiting on my to-go order, and knowing that my food will be to my liking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-louisville,3.72,3.72,3.72,,3.7200000000000006

It doesn't always deliver but tonight it certainly did.  As is my pattern when eating alone, I eat and drink at the bar. Preston, the server/bartender was fantastic. Made sure everything was good, made every accommodation to my order and truly was a delight. Cedar plank salmon and shisito peppers were great.

I had a house salad with champagne vinaigrette dressing that was delicious. Also the zucchini with shrimp over fettuccine was very good, except I would've liked a little less lemon. But still delicious. She had a Cobb salad and it was excellent. All fresh with great grilled chicken. Pizzas at the other tables looked very good, too, and we'll have to go back to try one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-louisville,3.8,3.8,3.8,,3.8
0,Emily K.,"Louisville, KY",114,32,52.0,4.0,2017-10-01,"This was my second time visiting California pizza kitchen. The first time I had a margarita pizza and it was great. I wanted to be adventurous this time so I tried the California club pizza. It wasn't my favorite. There was no sauce and barely any cheese. It had way too many greens just sitting on top. There were huge slices of avocado just sitting on top. I think it could have been a lot better with some kinda of sauce, less greens and chunks of avocado instead of slices.   It wasn't a bad experience; I just wasn't a fan of the pizza I tried. I'm sure there are many things on the menu that I would like. Our waitress was friendly.

1,Jessica G.,"Louisville, KY",211,62,22.0,5.0,2017-11-12,Excellent service!!!!!!!  I came for the Veterans Day special and was served by Steven who was very kind and personable.  I ordered the Chicken alfredo dish and it was amazing!!!!!  I was also given complimentary bread with oil that I didn't expect.   I didn't have cash so i kept adding things such as spinach or extra sauce to get a balance.  I naturally only drink water so I didn't get a beverage.  Still there was no check to pay so STEVEN if you randomly get money from a stranger one day it's a tip that you were owed.  I made a good mental note of his name and face.  The chefs were very professional and i enjoyed sitting at the bar and seeing exactly how much precision and expertise they take in making their magic.  I watched someone who wasn't a chef or a server look over dishes as they came out and checked for accuracy.  I was very impressed!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-louisville,3.92,3.92,3.92,,3.92
