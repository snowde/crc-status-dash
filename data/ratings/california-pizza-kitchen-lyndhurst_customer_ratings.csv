12,K L.,"North Ridgeville, OH",8,17,16.0,4.0,2012-01-19,"I go to CPK quite often, because I simply love their food! SERVICE: varies from good to bad Their service here seems to vary from terrible, crap service to good service on every visit.  Even when I came on a Tuesday afternoon when the restaurant wasn't at all busy, I received bad service.  That day, we were promptly seated and ordered immediately, but waited a whole hour for our two (simple) dishes: Garlic Cream Fettuccine. We called another server over and told her that we ordered an hour ago and our waitress was MIA.  Turns out, the waitress didn't put in our orders and totally forgot about us,  The manager did come by and our meals were on the house so that made up for the bad waitress's mistake. At that point, I decided to order their Tuscan Hummus appetizer to-go since my meal was free.  The waitress forgot to bring that out to me, too. -_- And this isn't even my worst experience from CPK! To be fair, most of my visits were decent or good service-wise.  - They don't take reservations on the weekend (inconvenient since they're really busy during the weekends!) FOOD: DELICIOUS! Tuscan hummus appetizer (Photo included) I love hummus and their hummus appetizer is one of the best hummus dishes I've ever had!  The pita bread is soooo soft and the hummus is topped off with tomatoes, basil, parsley, and garlic. I ALWAYS lick the plate clean. I highly recommend this appetizer.  Mediterranean Plate (Small cravings) The small cravings section of the menu lists appetizer dishes for one person so their portions are quite small - just enough for one person like it implies. The overall taste is good and I would order it again. Chipotle Chicken Pizza (Photo included) VERY spicy, but omg tastes amazing! I don't even like spicy food, but I absolutely love this pizza. I tried it on a whim since my boyfriend ordered it and now I can't get enough of it. The size of the pizza is on the smaller size, but for the taste, it is worth every penny. I highly recommend this pizza, but I'd like to warn you that you might become completely addicted to it like me. lol  Garlic Cream Fettuccine ($10) Simple, but great pasta dish! I order the fettuccine on 80% of my visits to CPK.  I crave it often because it's just so tasty.  The prominent flavor comes from the garlic.  It's a pleasant dish to eat - not bursting with flavors, yet still very satisfying. Baby Clam Linguine w/ Lemon Cream Sauce  A little bit on the spicy side - this dish tastes very yummy overall. They weren't cheap about the amount of baby clams they put in the dish, which I was very happy with. Portions are pretty good! Pineapple Pina Colada (non-alcoholic) Their pina coladas comes without alcohol regularly, but you can ask them to put rum in it. Although it's a little expensive ($4.50), it's well-worth it.  The pina colada is presented beautifully in a somewhat large glass.  Instead of the usual slushie-type drink, CPK's version is much creamier. I'm addicted to it as I'm a huge fan of pina coladas - especially CPK's pina coladas.  (Photo included) Raspberry Mango Pina colada (non-alcoholic) I was really wowed at how beautiful this drink looked (Photo included). It tastes amazing! I could drink this everyday... ATMOSPHERE - clean restaurant and restrooms - tweens frequently come here - on the weekends, CPK is usually busy so noise level is high - CPK seems like a family restaurant so it's not a very romantic place for dates, but Legacy Village is usually very nicely decorated and couples take a stroll around the balcony area or fountain often. After dining at CPK, couples can take a stroll around these areas. - Good location: Legacy Village has many stores and as mentioned before, it's nicely decorated with a fountain and balcony area, which are good hang-out places. There's also beachwood mall a little further down Cedar. I can't wait to come back here! :D",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lyndhurst?start=20,3.408,3.408,3.408,3.408,3.408

31,Daniel B.,"Uniontown, OH",27,382,58.0,4.0,2013-04-19,"Surprised by the food here. I didn't really expect much! I had The Meat Cravers (thin crust pizza). Nicely toasted crust but because it's on a ceramic plate, only the edges stay crispy. A little skimpy on the toppings, but good flavors. Got there at opening time and the place filled fast.

27,N L.,"Cleveland Heights, OH",0,10,,1.0,2013-07-11,"1. Our Server Rob was absolutely fantastic. His command of both his job and the authoritative command he demonstrated was admirable. Even after a sarcastic and frustrated quip by me, he still kept his cool. Under no circumstance do I blame my server for what happened. He was doing his job. It was his manager that was flatly deplorable. I would very much appreciate my money back. The story follows below. 2. This visit, my last, has unequivocally turned me off to 'CPK' for the rest of my life. Under no circumstances would I ever consider visiting another 'CPK' again -- at any location. Sadly, my girlfriend used to like this place, now she despises it. Upon ordering a poorly seasoned macaroni bite plate by my girlfriend, she asked our server for some marinera sauce to give it some more flavor to cut through the breaded and fried mess. He states that there was a $1.00 charge for the add on, and that the kitchen would ""saute"" some for us and he'd have it right up. Sitting at the bar, we watched as the open kitchen poured some from a plastic bag into the container, and then ladled an overly generous amount in to a dish. We then watched as one of the line cooks -- in full view -- put the dish into the microwave. The manager then served us the nuked tomato sauce and I politely, but succinctly, asked him why the sauce was put into the microwave, after we had been previously informed that the sauce would have been warmed in the pan. Yes, it tastes differently and would have been worth $1 had it been warmed in-house, and dare I say it I hoped would be made in-house, however it would have been fine if he just would have comped it -- even though admittedly I should have asked to comp the bites themselves.  The problem came when the manager decided to respond in a flippant manner. Not only did he drop the ball on quickly fixing the problem but yelled at both me and my girlfriend telling us that ""all add-ons cost $1"" and that ""...if we'd like it in a pan he could have it made for us in a pan."" I tired to reason with him as to why I was not going to pay for it. He continued to raise his voice, and rudely slammed the dish down when, exasperated, I asked him to just take it back. His sarcastic lack any sort of sophistication, his inability to rectify the situation, his disrespectful tone he took with my girlfriend -- a young woman whose job is to work with severely autistic girls as a teacher -- and the overall pathetic vibe I felt from the 'CPK' he managed ensures I'll, we'll, never return.

5,Arun M.,"Coralville, IA",36,340,11.0,3.0,2013-07-22,"I decided to go to CPK just because I have passed it so many times and wanted to try it out. Also one of my friends misses it a lot! We were there for lunch at 3 PM and it was mostly quiet. Most customers here were drinking beer and food was the second thing on their mind. I think that kind of took over the waiters too. They were quite slow. We were sitting outside and it took them 15 minutes to get water for us. The food arrived with some delay also.  I would be lying if I say I did not like their food. Food was good, but it had that character to it, which is usually found in a chain restaurant. We ordered California veggie pizza, all the ingredients were fresh and delicious. The Mediterranean Focaccia was good. I would have loved to see some more character to their food. At the end we had a feeling that there was nothing special in the food or experience. We were glad that our check was not more than what it would have been for a large pizza from Papa John's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lyndhurst?start=20,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5000000000000004

We were greeted right away and sat in a booth that accommodated by baby carrier perfectly. The host helped me get the baby carrier in the booth and settled.  Our server came over and got our waters right away and helped recommend an adult beverage right away. She told me about the plum martini, so I decided to try it out. It was amazing!!! I'm usually disappointed when I go with a recommendation, but not this time. I only wish that my glass was a little fuller. It wasn't as full as it should have been. I ordered the BBQ chopped chicken salad. I ordered the half size. The salad came out promptly and looked tasty. The half size was huge. I added avocados to my salad. The salad had fresh lettuce and the BBQ chicken was tasty. The avocados were fresh too! The server was nice and it was a pleasant experience. The prices are ok...

It had a complex mix of items in it: butternut squash, dates, avocado, almonds, beets, red peppers, chopped egg and cranberries. I don't usually like beets, but they blended perfectly into this salad. The waitress was efficient and quickly took our order right after brining out our waters as she noticed our menus were closed. Another person brought out the food, but she was back to check on us about 5 minutes later. She cleared the dishes quickly too, but then disappeared so there was a brief wait for our checks.

The management team helped a bit as we were so many, I didn't get the names but they were also a pleasure. The food of course was  delicious, too. We plan to return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lyndhurst,3.96,3.96,3.96,,3.96
49,Hope L.,"Cleveland, OH",58,4,11.0,4.0,2017-03-01,"My Star Rating Scale:  1- I will never ever return! 2- Okay, Meh. 3- Good, but my mom's is better. (lol) 4- Amazing Experience, will be back! 5- I am blown away, Bravo!  Service: 5/5 Food: 4/5 Price: 4/5 Menu: 5/5 Location: 5/5 Wifi: 5/5 Atmosphere: 5/5 - Family friendly. Theme: Modern Pizza Kitchen Overall: 4.5! Breakdown: So we were seated fast. I had a sangria drink that was okay, nothing too special. This place is a modern pizza kitchen and the menu is decent. They offer plates that are not pizza related. The choices for apps could be better. I ordered the buffalo cauliflower app, a mushroom, pep, and sausage pizza, and the garlic chicken and seasonal veggies. ALL GOOD!! As far as the cauliflower, I make better at home, but I like theirs because it was lighter served on top on blue cheese and green onion!! Their pizza crust is light.. I love the freshly sliced ingredients. Much better than Pizza chains! The Garlic chicken was GREAT!! It is high in cals and sodium, so watch that. I love that the same effort is put into anything you order. I had plenty food to take home and share with my sister who loved it all as well! I was served by an older gentleman who was very nice. Final Thoughts: I have never had a bad plate from this kitchen. It's a mod pizza kitchen and it stands on its own. They do offer take out/pick up! Next time you want to go out for pizza, give them a try. The Pizzas are a little bigger than personal sizes, but they are thinner!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lyndhurst,3.92,3.92,3.92,,3.92
48,Kaleigh L.,"Cleveland, OH",453,103,111.0,3.0,2017-03-21,"If you are in need of a spot to dine at, located across from Bar Loui, this is a good spot, most of the time. From lettuce wraps to unique and traditional pizzas, it can be found for you! Service and ambiance are average, a more modern version of your typical pizza shop. The garlic and chicken pizza is one to be reckon with though, don't be afraid to step outside of your comfort zone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lyndhurst,3.84,3.84,3.84,,3.84
47,Bridget B.,"Cleveland, OH",110,70,79.0,4.0,2017-04-13,"Get the butter cake. I crave CPK's butter cake more often that I would like to admit.  In terms of starters, I love their brussel sprout flatbread! When I order an entree I almost always get their Chinese Chicken Salad. This salad is the first salad I've ever had that made me say ""wow, that's a good salad!"". I rarely do salad for dinner but their Chinese Chicken Salad is so good that I end up ordering it again and again. But for me, the real reason to go to California Pizza Kitchen is the butter cake. I never would have ordered it from the menu description unless the manager had not, himself, highly recommended that I try it. It is SO good. Out of this world delicious!  Aside from the food, I have always had excellent service at this CPK. The wait staff is always attentive and friendly. I would recommend going here (and definitely getting the butter cake) if you're in Legacy shopping. You are also able to order online and pick it up if that's more your style!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lyndhurst,3.88,3.88,3.88,,3.88

46,Ashley M.,"Cleveland, OH",236,349,782.0,4.0,2017-06-10,Had an early dinner last night and I was pleasantly surprised by this place. It isn't your typical pizza joint.  The salad I ordered was delicous. I really enjoyed the fresh apples and candied walnuts. Plus the dressing was fantastic. I believe it was called the waldorf!  My husband ordered a pizza that was spicy and sweet. I had a piece that was cold later that evening and it was great! The crust was nice and thin. Our server was Sam. He was pretty awesome! It wasn't crazy busy anx the restaurant was clean and the drinks were fresh.  I'll definitely be back!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-lyndhurst,3.8,3.8,3.8,,3.8

51,Sandasia L.,"Willoughby, OH",0,13,6.0,3.0,2017-11-15,"I ordered food to go from this restaurant. My husband got the short ribs over Mac n Cheese and I got the roasted veggie salad *with blackened salmon added*. Out of habit I checked the bag and realized that my husband's food was missing. She realized the mistake and gave me his food out of the warmer. We left and when we got home I noticed that they did not add the salmon. Now, I would not have left my house if it wasn't for the fact that the salmon was +$6 added to the $16 salad. I called and they told me to call when I got outside and they would bring it out. I called and the woman stated ""I will be out in one minute"". I waited about 7 minutes and just went in. The +$6 salmon was literally about 5 small pieces of salmon. I requested to speak to the manager bc that was robbery! He stated ""This is what you get for $6? Wow!"" Which was questionable bc you are a manager, you should know. Nonetheless, they were kind enough to take the salad and salmon off of my bill all together which I appreciated. I still took off two stars bc the food was not worth $44.
