The guacamole dish is tiny.  Maybe 2 dozen chips on the plate and a scoop of the guacamole dip.  Not great.  In fact, kinda tasteless and I really love guacamole.  A good 2.  The white corn kernels they put in there are pretty dominant in the dip but was seriously lacking in taste. The lettuce wrap actually wasn't bad.  A 3.  Pull your lettuce wrap in your hand and put their ground beef in it and bite.  Get this if you come here.  Spencer thinks lettuce wraps are just an American version of Thai Larp.  He's probably right.  This dish pretty much is that except without any of the spiciness.   The BBQ chicken pizza, meh.  Not great.  Slightly thin crust but without the crunchiness you expect from a think crust.  And the pizza's kinda small.  I could eat a whole pizza by myself.  Maybe 12"" in diameter?  A 3. The salad actually wasn't bad.  I thought it had more flavor than the pizza.  A pretty decent sized salad with a good mix of greens and spinach.  If I ever come back to a CPK, I think I'll only order a salad.  What does that tell you when I go to a pizza restaurant and don't even plan to order the pizza?  Yeah, ""if I ever come back"".  Probably won't unless invited.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-manhattan-beach?start=140,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.7640000000000002,3.1600000000000006

So by the time I get out of work, into my car and find my way over to Manhattan Beach Plaza where this CPK is located, Its time to pick-up the grub. The parking here at lunch time can be absolutely horrendous. Never fear, CPK has a couple of parking spots designated just for those customers who want to pick-up their food or for those that don't even want to leave the comfort of their vehicle, they have curbside service here, too.

Here's where the 5 star review comes in.  While the dining experience was closer to a 3, John turned it into a 5+ experience.  He apologized on behalf of his host right away, and had us laughing within minutes.  I kept my eye on him throughout the night, and I really enjoyed the way he interacted with his guests.  He was chatting, laughing and even giving hugs.  I walked away feeling as though I had received a lesson on how to be more forgiving and how important it is to be a great communicator.  Our CPK is so lucky to have John.  We will definitely be back...and our salad and pizza were yummy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-manhattan-beach?start=180,3.24,3.24,3.24,3.0920000000000005,3.2400000000000007

Quick service, their staff seems to be well prepped for the business lunch crowd. Never had a long wait for a table. Food is typical for a CPK, which I enjoy. I especially like their thin crust pizzas, which are relatively new. They also seem to change up their menu now and then, so repeat customers don't get bored.

We had... -Avocado Club Eggrolls as appetizer - Stuffed with bacon, chicken, jack cheese and avocado. creamy, crispy and delicious! Don't think about the calories. Just get it!  -Wild Mushroom Pizza. 3 kinds of mushroom with white sauce. Very hearty and flavorful. -Original BBQ Chicken Chopped salad with avocado. Love the crispy tortilla chips against the cool crisp lettuce and tangry dressing!  Service was okay. Our server didn't engage much, but he was very polite. I didn't give it 4 stars was because they gave us a dirty table. It was still wet n sticky. We asked one of the staff to clean it again. Once the table was cleaned, we held the menu and it was wet n sticky on the bottom part. Really? Gosh, we were turned off, we almost left. But we decided to stay because I really wanted to use my $50 gf that my friend gave me and didn't wanna drive to another CPK.  Other than that, the food was great!

67,Mia K.,"Los Angeles, CA",127,354,319.0,4.0,2014-05-15,"CPK serves more than pizza and I've been happy with their food the past two times I've been here. They have good choices for their light menu. You can get pasta, sandwiches, salads and of course, unique pizzas like Chipotle chicken with poblanos and roasted corn.  Lunch service was very slow, possibly so because our group of 7 was served by two waitresses.  I think there was confusion between servers and also miscommunication with the kitchen as a result.  My friends, who are regulars, say the service is usually good. I wish they hadn't waited 20 minutes to ask us if we wanted bread.  Our food: -Margharita pizza - we ordered goat cheese with it and it was awesome. Great crust, too. Big pieces of basil, not skimpy shreds.  -BBQ chicken salad - good but needed more dressing.  -Lite shrimp scampi w zucchini slices - good but the lemon taste dominated the garlic too much. I like how they added the zucchini to make it healthier.  Another light option I had before is the - arugala quinoa, feta cheese salad with added chicken. Excellent and filling.  -Kung pao chicken with spaghetti - I didn't try it but my friend gave it a thumbs up -Bianco flatbread pizza - white truffle cream Gorgonzola, mozzarella and fresh sage. My friend's mother loved it.  -Spicy fennel sausage and poblano flatbread - good but only small pieces of sausage -Kids' curly pasta with butter and cheese - big bowl but the boy inhaled this and still ate other food  -Chicken piccata. My sister has a garlic allergy. She ordered the chicken piccata after learning it had no garlic. She found some pieces that looked like garlic and spoke to our waitress and showed them. The waitress got the manager who assured us the recipe hangs in the kitchen and is garlic free. He offered to remake the dish but my sister opted instead to get a Hawaiian personal pizza, which they rushed to be made. The pizza had large pieces of both ham and the fruit. I'm not a fan but it was a good slice.  CAUTION: Kids beverages are really sweet. I would taste your child's lemonade. It was way too sweet and needed diluting. Kids have enough energy as it is.  CPK is a casual place with good value for fair prices.  I may find myself here more often because there are more things I want to try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-manhattan-beach?start=60,3.28,3.19,3.19,2.7359999999999998,3.226

When the bill arrived they charged us for a regular pizza. I questioned the charge and the waiter came to the conclusion that I wanted a whole pizza and not a kids pizza. Geeeee I have two small kids I clearly ordered a kids pizza for the kids.  Well the manager comes over and interrogates us wondering why we didn't return the pizza when it came out...!

I came here on a Tuesday night around 9 and it was still pretty crowded. This was my first time at this location since I typically go to the location in Redondo Beach.  The service here was very attentive and friendly. They stopped by several times to refill drinks and to bring out extra items that we asked for. // FOOD // BBQ chicken chopped salad: This is always a must for me when I come to CPK. The salad is so refreshing with lettuce, corn, beans, tomatoes and shredded chicken in a ranch sauce with BBQ sauce on top. The slice of lime that they serve with it adds on extra flavor.  Habanero carnitas pizza: This is probably one of my more favorite pizzas at CPK. Shredded carnitas, red onions with a habanero sauce on the side. This pizza is definitely packed with flavor. The carnitas adds a smoky flavor while the habanero sauce adds heat, but also some sweetness to the pizza.  Chicken piccata: The chicken piccata was pretty good. It was served with pasta and I really enjoyed the sauce. It had the right amount of lemon to it, but also the butter and capers added plenty of salt to the dish. Overall, this was a great CPK location to come to.

I expected a silver tin, half tray for the close to $50+++ they charged.  Now the ""guacamole"" and chips. Wow. They charged $26.99+++ for a quart size plastic container full of corn and a dollop of avocado mixed in. My guests were all calling it corn dip. How embarrassing!! It was paired with the equivalent to 99 cent tortilla chips.  $49.99+++for their four cheese ravioli had no taste and again was enough to feed 4 people. Never order again. The only decent item were the sandwiches which were prepared with annoying thick bread. Everyone were scarfing them down because they were hungry and desperate.

On 1/22 my 3 friends and I went to this location (Manhatten Beach) as we have gone several times in the past. Dinner was good, everything seemed fine. When the bill came, we split the amount 4 ways, the total for us all was $35 per person (which included tax & tip) 2 paid cash while the other two of us paid with our debit. I told the waiter to charge the two cards $35 each, the rest was cash and the change was his tip (20% because he seemed nice). He did that (So at least we thought). We left the restaurant everything was fine. Come a week later when I noticed on my bank account that I was charged $40. I called my friend who also had paid with a CC and the same thing happened to her. On January 30th, she called the restaurant and the manager, Walter Hastey, sure enough found the receipt. He emailed them to her for confirmation and we found out that not only had the waiter changed the amount, he had re-printed the receipt, and signed it as well! That was an extra $10 for our order plus committed forgery by signing our names! The manager, Walter Hastey, acknowledge the error to my friend and said that ""the conversation with the waiter was going to be awkward"" What about the customer who he committed fraud too??? Isn't that more awkward?? Yes it was only $5 each, but HE REPRINTED AND SIGNED OUR NAMES!!!!  How many times has this guy done it to customers before??????? He also said he would give both my friend and I a $30 Gift Card each for what we went through. Later that morning, I called the CPK Corporate offices (310-342-5000) to let them know what was going on at their establishment in Manhatten Beach, which I had to leave a message...twice!I received NO call back so later that evening I called the same manager , Walter Hastey, of restaurant my friend had spoken to, to ask what the outcome of the waiter was. At first he was NOT apologetic at all, he sounded bothered that I had called and he acknowledged that corporate had re routed the message to him. Keep in mind, I was one of the victims and he had never spoken to me before. When I told him it felt worse that I'm calling about the situation and he sounded bothered, he then changed his voice to sound like it mattered. He also told me that he was trying to make it right by sending us the gift cards like he told my friend(which he said would be put in the mail that night).

I came with my mom for dinner on a Friday since it was right across from her office. We were seated right away, but from the get go there were kids literally running everywhere and screaming all over the place. My mom ordered her usual Moroccan-Spiced Chicken Salad with roasted butternut squash, dates, avocado, toasted almonds, beets, red peppers, chopped egg, cranberries, and tossed with their house-made Champagne vinaigrette. She really likes it, but I didn't care for it. I ordered the White Pizza with Mozzarella, Ricotta, Parmesan, Pecorino Romano, sautéed spinach and roasted garlic. That's what I ordered 15 years ago, but it wasn't as I remembered. The roasted garlic came in huge chunks sparsely dispersed over the pizza. It's pretty gross to get a bite full of garlic. I would much rather prefer to have smaller crushed pieces over the whole pie. Other than that, it still wasn't very good. The White Top from Blaze is better, faster, and tastier. I also ordered a watermelon lemonade. A manager who brought our order to our table asked if I wanted a refill. I said, ""Yes, please."" He came back with a drink that was orange rather than pink. Before I even said anything he assured me that it was a watermelon lemonade, but from a different machine. Once I tasted it, I realized that it was a mango lemonade. It was fine. However, why tell me it's for sure watermelon when it wasn't and obviously didn't even look the same. Service from our waitress was alright.

I ordered a wedge salad for an appetizer both times... It was better on Tuesday than on Thursday. The Tuesday salad looked and tasted fresher. On Thursday I also ordered the sweet corn guacamole.

I just simply and kindly stated I felt that them not bringing it out was poor service on there part. The manger stared at me like I was stupid and was not speaking English. And then stated that its a safety issue that no employees were able to leave the restaurant after 9:30. And that if I was more clear on being pregnant he would of brought it out. Completely blaming me. And the look on his face and tone of his voice was so condescending I almost died. It was 5 minuets after 9:30 and I was like so if I came at 9:29 you would bring it out?

It unfortunately has evolved into a different type of establishment that its creators had originally intended. Once a casual, yet avant-garde restaurant has turned into a loud, kid packed, mess hall.  I could say that this change might be due to a changing demographic and a new wave of young families moving into the area. This though, is not the case as the change in clientele is reflective of CPKs menu. CPK was known for introducing new and exciting entrees with particular emphasis on Pizza. Now, the menu has stagnated and many items are becoming long in the tooth. The menu isn't reflective of an exciting offering, but rather entrees that appeal to a child's palate. That goes for all CPKs and not just this establishment. Additionally, the noise level is pretty high at this store and management has decided to play loud music to drown it out. This isn't working. Recommendations The Kung Pao Spaghetti is still very good. I hope this isn't removed from the menu. Avocado egg rolls are also very good.

7,Roger W.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",3,27,,1.0,2017-12-14,"Very disappointed, enjoyed this restaurant for years but recently food has become very subpar. We visited last month and quality of food had seriously deteriorated. I wrote an email to management and received no reply. At that point I should have realized that management couldn't care less, but we made one last visit in hopes that things might have improved. Once again quality of food was terrible. Sad to see a local restaurant deteriorate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-manhattan-beach,3.32,3.36,3.212,,3.3440000000000003

Go somewhere else!""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-manhattan-beach,3.16,3.32,3.2,,3.2560000000000007
1,Willis W.,"San Gabriel, CA",233,344,31.0,3.0,2017-12-20,"Parking: Right in front of Macy's. CPK is surrounded by parking. We came here for a celebration for work and reserved the patio area. The only complaint was that they didn't arrange the sun shade to block the light from blinding everybody. The servers were busy helping the people inside so I can't blame them.  But other than putting on some sunglasses, the food was what you expect. It isn't phenomenal but it will fill you up. I got the Kung Pao Spaghetti and it was more salty than spicy. I added chicken to it and there was very little chicken. For 13+ bucks, I do not recommend it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-manhattan-beach,3.08,3.31,3.2,,3.218
0,Pamela A.,"Redondo Beach, CA",0,8,,4.0,2017-12-22,"Jim is a great server.  We had a really lovely early dinner ordering Margarita pizza (which was PERFECT) and Green Pea-Barley soup for me (it's cold outside; this was nice and warming). Normally we love this restuarant, but... first of all the female hostess  welcomed us as 'Hi, Guys!""  We are two women.  She took us to our booth and again called us guys.  Just a little disconcerting. The music was awful and really too loud.  There was quite a din.  We often eat here and have not noticed the music being so loud and not really fit for eating and conversation. I do want to say, that when we thanked anyone for their service, they DID NOT say ""No problem.""  Thank you!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-manhattan-beach,3.16,3.32,3.204,,3.2560000000000007
2,Maria S.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",0,30,,3.0,2018-01-07,"Always reliable. I ordered flatbread which was delicious but skimpy on ingredients.  Also, why no calorie count on menu?

Large restaurant but women's restroom only has two stalls.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-manhattan-beach,3.12,3.3,3.204,,3.2280000000000006

Lunch menu looks good, pizza & a salad and the wife had there potato soup. As usual food was good & service was good. The only reason fir 4 star and not 5 is because choices to pizza & salad were limited but good still.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-manhattan-beach,3.16,3.29,3.204,,3.238
