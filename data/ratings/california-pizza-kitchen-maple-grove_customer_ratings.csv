2,Abe M.,"St Paul, MN",154,332,114.0,3.0,2012-09-07,"This place was better then I thought.  I came in saying I wasn't in the mood for pizza, yet it looked so appetizing on the menu, that I ordered the BBQ Chicken Hawaiian Pizza.  I ate the whole thing.  I was stuffed after wards.  It's good to indulge every now and then, or at least that's what I tell myself.  I will probably come back to this place to try some other non-pizza food that looked tasty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-maple-grove,,,,,
0,Cin L.,"Manhattan, NY",2,52,43.0,4.0,2013-01-21,My brother really likes to go to this place when he goes to the city to visit. Oriental salad for him. Buffalo chicken salad with no beans for me. Pizza is magnificent. We normally share.  One star down: Staff is young. Not always attentive. But food is great.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-maple-grove,,,,,
