143,Ravi J.,"Foothill Ranch, CA",30,163,20.0,4.0,2012-01-02,I have became fan of their Tuscan Hummus served with PITA Bread .. We then ordered a Japanese Eggplant :) Loved the variety and taste ... I would really recommend anyone looking for some change of the regular pizza routine and try something new ... I usually prefer Pan Pizza or thick crust but Loved their THIN crust pizza ..

295,Limor Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,,1.0,2012-02-14,"What a big disappointment for that location! I have been going there for years (used to be kids friendly too) and used to love to go there with my girlfriends for a light lunch with friends and family in the evening. They had a nice menu for kids. Well, it all changed on November 2011. we took our little girl there for her birthday (her request) told the hosted it was her birthday, when I noticed the our server was a little off...he did not offer a drink with the kids meal, bread was stale like it has been sitting in the refrigerator for days (I would not give it to my guests). I approached the server to let him know it is my daughter's 6th birthday...nothing...he had at least 5 people with him to sing to a table by us but only brought an ice cream for her (did not ask me what I wanted) and said ""happy birthday sweetie""... just him ....not even her name...I believe it is under new management (at least I hope that will explain it) but it was just bad. I have not been back ever since...I prefer to spend my $50.00 on other chain restaurants such as cheese cake factory where I get good service and good food.

Had a terrible experience when picking up a phone order. First, upon arrival was not greeted properly. After paying for our order and tipping the attendant, she said that the order will be ready shortly. 15 minutes later we were still sitting and waiting for a simple SALAD that was ordered half an hour prior our arrival over the phone. Nobody came to check on us or give us an update on the order. 20-30 min go by after the point we have been told the order will be ready shortly and I go and ask what the status is. The girl who processed the order lets me know that the salad has been taken by a waiter by mistake and that they will make a new one. SERIOUSLY?! And you couldn't come and apologize for the wait?! I ask to speak to a manger and when a lady comes and I explain the rudeness of her employee she has an even worse off attitude. What is wrong with these people?! Never eating at that place again!

141,Allie L.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,77,141.0,2.0,2012-04-15,"My friend got me to enter a chain restaurant! Ahhhh! The food: Tortilla ""spring rolls"" - Basically rolled quesadillas with too much cheese. The difference between the three flavors was overpowered by the cheese. I don't get how these are spring rolls in any context... Decent quesadillas. Avocado club egg rolls - Weird hybrid of a BLT sandwich stuffed inside wonton wrappers. Not a big fan of deep fried avocados -- a bit conflicting. Chopped salad - Iceberg lettuce with salami and basil! I guess they do best with simple here. Wild mushroom pizza - Generous amount of four different types of mushrooms. I think it desperately needs some acidity though. Marinara or pepperoncinis? Cranberry cooler - Club soda with a splash of cranberry juice. And apparently asking for just cranberry juice refill gets charged again as a separate drink. Wtf?? Atmosphere was nice, but packed with kids and college kids discussing the day's afternoon hangovers. Waiter wasn't the most attentive nor very friendly. Generically awesome. A bit overpriced as well.

Came back chewy, as if it was a day old. The rest of the meal was equally unimpressive. But it gets worse... On the way back to the car, my buddy realized he that he had left his iPhone on the table. He went back but it was gone. The people at a nearby table said that only the busboy had been by, so my friend went to the managers. They refused to bring out the busboy. It gets worse. Using ""Google's Latitude"" software and all ""Find iPhone"", I could see the phone was in the restaurant. The managers still refused to do anything other than hand out their business cards. Oh yeah... they did one other thing: They sent the busboy home. I bet he had the phone with him. My buddy contacted the Corporate office. They gave him the runaround for a month, saying their insurance company would take care of it. Finally, after ignoring all of the calls, the insurance company said that California Pizza Kitchen told them not to pay. I understand that a business can't vouch for all of its employees, but there's no excuse for not being responsible to your customers. In fact, it's disgusting. Another friend left his phone at the Island's in Marina del Rey. Not only was the phone not stolen, the manager tracked my friend down and waited after-hours for him to pick it up.

They make delicious pizzas but they are small for $12+/-. Serv ice was very good despite being busy so tha twas a plus. For a pizza place I think their beer selection is poor and small.

After the shrimp fell and landed on the towel, he grabed them all with one hand and threw them in the box(I assumed it was for someone working there)  I saw them box it up and put it in a bag and then handed it to a lady who was at the to-go side.

This was a nice CPK on the inside, and it was extremely busy.  We had about a 20 minute wait before we were seated.  Once seated, we received pretty decent service.  My wife and I each ordered a tea, mine a regular and hers a peach.  Who knew that peach tea was 50 cents more than regular tea?  Strange, but oh well.  For our food, we each ordered a pizza.  I got the BBQ chicken with bacon, while my wife just got a standard pepperoni pizza.  The food was good.  Nothing outstanding, but certainly good.

I ordered the tequila chicken pasta, which I have ordered in the past and loved!  Last night it had, literally, 8 very small pieces of chicken.  I recall the dish having much more chicken than that.  The service was underwhelming.  Maybe because we were considered a party of 8, even though three of the eight were children, and an 18% gratuity was added on whether her service was good or not.  Her service was worth 10% at the most. She acted as if she could have cared less.  Some one else brought our food and cleared our dishes. She never came back to see if we were doing okay.

I've been to locations in Manhattan Beach, Redondo Beach, the CPK Express one in Redondo I think, and the Culver City one. This was the first time I ordered Thai Chicken Pizza and the White Corn Guacamole & Chips Small Plate at this location, although I've been here before and ordered other things. I order these a lot and know what they usually taste and look like. The Thai Chicken Pizza wasn't made very well, it had way too much veggies so that it overwhelmed the chicken and didn't have a balanced taste. I love vegetables so it wasn't that I dislike veggies but more the veggie/chicken/sauce ratio. The peanut sauce wasn't evenly spread, so I had bites oozing lots of sauce and bites that were very dry and sauceless. The White Corn Guac is one of my new favorites and is well executed at the Culver City location and looks just like it's picture, with lots of corn and small diced avocado and a balanced flavor. At this MDR location, instead of diced avocado it was large chunks and tasted overwhelmingly of jicama with barely any corn and also too much beans, so the flavor and texture profile was completely off. I mean seriously, how hard is it to dice something as soft as avocado. To me it just seems the kitchen staff is either extremely lazy or inexperienced because their lack of execution really shows and unfortunately made for a very rare disappointing dinner at CPK, one of my favorite restaurant chains.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marina-del-rey?start=220,3.16,3.03,3.03,2.412,3.082

For those who don't - just know that you'll want to practice patience looking for parking while navigating around others who seem oblivious to the fact that they're holding up traffic and creating a log jam, in an already packed parking lot.  As for the restaurant, there's both indoor and outdoor seating. One the chillier nights, I've seen a lot of empty tables because no one want to be out in the cold when the marine layer starts creeping in. It's warmer and cozier indoors and you don't have to deal with the vehicular noise from the parking lot.  Then there's the service. On this visit, our server seemed to either be slow, or just didn't care to serve our table. I can't be sure which it was but to have to ask to be served, when I thought that's the primary function of the wait staff - just didn't calculate right for me. No follow up to check on how the dishes came out nor whether we wanted anything else. We also had to flag her down for the check after she walked by us several times, checking up on the tables around us.  The food was okay. I tried the Tequila Lime Fettucini and there definitely is a lime flavor. Too much in fact. It took away from the rest of the dish so keep that in mind and ask for less if you decided to try it yourself. If you like a heavy lime presence, then this is the dish for you. My family seemed to enjoy their orders. The only comment I heard was that the wild mushroom pizza could have used more mushroom, and possibly less cheese.

About three years ago I noticed the quality of the food had just gone downhill and and the cleanliness of cutlery, glasses and china was awful. I was constantly sending them back because they were dirty.  For the past three years I had been frequenting the Manhattan Beach location instead and was very happy with them. I found out that one of my favorite managers from Manhattan Beach was transferred to Marina Del Rey and so my wife and I decided to try the Marina location again. Whenever our favorite manager was there we had clean place settings and good hot food. When she is not there everything goes back to the way it used to be....BAD. My wife and I went there again today for dinner. We sat at the bar and I asked for a water and my wife for a pink lemonade. When the drinks arrived my wife's glass had lipstick all around the rim and my glass had some black gooey substance sticking to the outside. I was so turned off that I was not even prepared to try and eat there. If they cannot give you a clean glass, goodness knows what else is dirty. I called the restaurant some 25 minutes later to speak with their manager. I was kept on hold for over 9 minutes without anyone coming back on the line to tell me they were getting the manager. He finally came to the phone and was apologetic for what had happened. Being apologetic is one thing and of course appreciated but it would be so much better if they could get their restaurant back to a level where one would want to eat there. My advice, don't go there.

These two locations are very interchangeable to us. The quality of the food and service being consistently well above average. But I think in terms of what CPK offers they get things very right. The appetizers pair very well with the entrées which pair very well with the desserts. There is enough variety in all categories that we can always find something that suits whatever mood we're in. And then maybe the most difficult thing is to not offer so many things that it makes it too difficult for someone to decide. And the same can be said for having such a large menu that it makes it too large a task for the kitchen to deliver on the consistency that we really value.

OK we waited some more. Finally we are seated in one of their small booths - uncomfortable. I don't say anything. We waited and waited some more. Finally the server comes, she is nice and apologizes.

Then, over the years I've eaten it at various airport CPK Express locations and felt cheated from my first earlier impression. You see many of these California Pizza Express locations skimped on servings and served sub par less than mediocre Za.  I was left believing this chain had gone to the dogs. I do realize that CPK express in the airports were different from the sit down California Pizza Kitchens.    So we decided to have a go at this place the last night in LA as this location was near the airport. The place was packed with families and there was barely a table open. It was hopping to say the least.   We had ordered a bunch of items my brother ordered the Sicilian pizza.  My wife ordered the Thai crunch salad. I had a taste and it was a great medley of crunch, flavour and freshness. I ordered the fish tacos with avocado.  They were not the best ones I've eaten but were a solid 3.5/5.  For my daughter she got an order of mac n cheese which she was more than satisfied with.  Everything came out very well decorated an appetizing and we were extremely content with our meal.

On 1/22 my 3 friends and I went to this location (Manhatten Beach) as we have gone several times in the past. Dinner was good, everything seemed fine. When the bill came, we split the amount 4 ways, the total for us all was $35 per person (which included tax & tip) 2 paid cash while the other two of us paid with our debit. I told the waiter to charge the two cards $35 each, the rest was cash and the change was his tip (20% because he seemed nice). He did that (So at least we thought). We left the restaurant everything was fine. Come a week later when I noticed on my bank account that I was charged $40. I called my friend who also had paid with a CC and the same thing happened to her. On January 30th, she called the restaurant and the manager, Walter Hastey, sure enough found the receipt. He emailed them to her for confirmation and we found out that not only had the waiter changed the amount, he had re-printed the receipt, and signed it as well! That was an extra $10 for our order plus committed forgery by signing our names! The manager, Walter Hastey, acknowledge the error to my friend and said that ""the conversation with the waiter was going to be awkward"" What about the customer who he committed fraud too??? Isn't that more awkward?? Yes it was only $5 each, but HE REPRINTED AND SIGNED OUR NAMES!!!!  How many times has this guy done it to customers before??????? He also said he would give both my friend and I a $30 Gift Card each for what we went through. Later that morning, I called the CPK Corporate offices (310-342-5000) to let them know what was going on at their establishment in Manhatten Beach, which I had to leave a message...twice!I received NO call back so later that evening I called the same manager , Walter Hastey, of restaurant my friend had spoken to, to ask what the outcome of the waiter was. At first he was NOT apologetic at all, he sounded bothered that I had called and he acknowledged that corporate had re routed the message to him. Keep in mind, I was one of the victims and he had never spoken to me before. When I told him it felt worse that I'm calling about the situation and he sounded bothered, he then changed his voice to sound like it mattered. He also told me that he was trying to make it right by sending us the gift cards like he told my friend(which he said would be put in the mail that night). He asked for my personal info so he can send mine directly to me (which now I dread giving it to him!) Well as of now, neither one of us has received anything! I'm not even sure to be honest that the waiter has been let go. he probably just got moved to another location! All I can say CHECK YOUR STATEMENTS FOR ANY PREVIOUS DINNING EXPERIENCES HERE!

I will be happily posting this to all CPK close to the area just incase the waiter was just moved to another restaurant location to make people aware of your company's business values and not let this happen to someone else again.

Alexandra was attentive and was extremely knowledgable with the menu which made my decision making a whole lot easier. She was warm, genuine and truly seemed to care about her customers dining experience. If all food servers shared her positive attitude, there wouldn't be an empty chair in any food establishment! I really cannot say enough about this young lady. Her  customer service alone is the reason why my family and I will be back to this location! 5 *S*T*A*R*S* for service!! 4 *S*T*A*R*S*  for the food. They made some drastic changes to the menu and there is less of a selection. If you stick with the pizza you won't be disappointed.

They brought us a salad they clearly hand picked the chicken out of and still left shreds of chicken in it. GROSS. Makes me question how they handle their food at all. The waitress was barely apologetic and the staff clearly was inspecting it as if we were lying. I didn't receive the drink I ordered till the end of the meal, again they were unapologetic. On our pizza I asked for half mushroom and same there was sausage clearly on it which I accidentally ate. If I were a more difficult customer I would have made a scene. I just think they should REALLY be more considerate about how they are serving their food. I'm leaving utterly disappointed that no one offered to comp anything or even a discount.

Second of all, it took almost 15 minutes to get crushed red pepper for my pizza.

Even though it didn't seem busy, it took a while for us to get seated and even though there seemed to be plenty of booths available they wanted to seat us in the back corner by the restrooms.  We asked to be sat at a different booth and they graciously agreed.  Our server Joey finally showed up with no friendly greeting or smile.  He brought us waters, little did we know that this would be our only glass as he never offered to refill our glasses. We ordered our food and again, even though the restaurant didn't seem busy it took a long time for the food to come.  We ordered two orders of the fettuccine with garlic cream sauce. When the orders arrived there was literally no sauce on the pasta. We were disappointed and asked Joey for extra sauce, he was clearly bothered by us and offered no apology.  Even though we had two orders he only brought out one small bowl of extra sauce, barely enough for one order. He never once asked us if everything was ok and never offered to refill our drinks.  He was a really lousy server.  And the food was only ok.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-marina-del-rey?start=40,2.48,2.81,2.932,2.404,2.678

A creamy tomato base with plenty of vegetables, served piping hot I enjoyed the Tequila Chicken Spinach Linguini, I asked for the $5 shrimp add on. The flavor was mild no need for the lime with this tequila dish, I was glad I had ordered the extra shrimp the chicken portion was literally five chunks.  P ordered her usual mushroom pizza on thin crust with an alfradp sauce and a white truffle oil drizzle on the side.

I ordered the salad with the strawberries and watermelon and it was epic. She ordered the macaroni and cheese about  1/4 of the way through I saw her pulling out what looked to me like stringing cheese from her mouth but it was a piece of string.  We notified the server and he quickly apologized and offered her something else. She ordered the same and they brought her a new one.  The manager came over and apologized as well and she explained it was a piece of the chefs coat. We finished up and when we got the check they charged us full rate for everything. I would expect to at least get the macaroni and cheese comped. Not sure of their policy I paid the bill and we moved on.  I emailed corporate the next morning and told them of the situation I also said don't send me anything free I just want to know your policy on these types of things.

I'll give benefit of the doubt because there might have been other reasons for the lack of immediate service.  They should tend to the needs of every individual more often instead of stopping at the same table, getting their order right even if they are halfway done with their meals. I stepped in for 15 minutes and continued to wait even when I asked for my server. I will assume the location here tends to be slower but some more effort should be put into the needs of all customers, not short stopping. Overall though the taste of CPK is fine.
