The waitress was very pleasant to me.

We started with the spinach and artichoke dip and chips for an appetizer. Amazing! He ordered the garlic cream fettuccine with chicken and shrimp and added mushrooms, I ordered the Habanero Carnitas pizza. The fettuccine could have used a little more sauce but all in all everything was great! The habanero sauce was given to me in a seperate dish and was cold compared to the hot pizza but it was still good and very hot... just the way I like it. We took all of the leftovers and a slice of the pumpkin cheesecake to go and it was neatly packaged in a reusable tote bag. Our waitress was very personable and helpful while we selected our drinks.

Had just the right ratio of bbq sauce, gouda cheese, red onion, chicken, and garnished with fresh cilantro. It came quickly and was nice and hot...truly a GREAT pizza! Also got a Cobb salad. Actually it was a ""half"" salad...and good thing too...it was HUGE! You could tell the salad was prepared with care. The presentation was very nice and had well defined sections of diced tomato, avocado, egg, bacon, chicken, lettuce, all with a nice blue cheese dressing. All items were VERY FRESH.

Appetizers are all great here, my favorite though is the corn and black bean guacamole... It's not a huge plate but can maybe be shared between two people. Our favorite favorite favorite dish here is the chipotle chicken pizza , it is delicious and comes with a cilantro lime crema sauce you can either dip or drizzle on the pizza which is refreshing to the spicy pizza. Tostada pizza was good but cannot re heat with the lettuce on it. Dan had the California club pizza and said it was even better than our favorite (crazy) and even the regular peperoni and cheese Pizza is delicious. Not a big fan of the garlic fettuccine. Kung pao pasta is great. There passionfruit mojitos ate really really good!! Would recommend to any and eveyone . Even kids menu is very good.

52,Jason K.,"Waterbury, CT",53,328,700.0,4.0,2014-06-24,"Awesome service! Parking is what the resort has and the bathrooms are located in the resort itself so those need to be commented on separately. The pizza just wasn't for me. It was good, but I did not see what was so special about it - special enough to spend 12-15 bucks on a 10"" thin crust pizza? Regular Menu was also full of other entrees aside from pizza, so I do have other options aside from pizza during a future visit. They did have Gluten Free pizza, as well as other gf entrees and the waitress was very knowledgeable and willing to go in the back and ensure that it was safe for Celiacs. That was a plus. GF stuff is labeled on the menu as GF so it is easy to find. **After visiting, I saw that this place was GiG trained. Noise level was high, but at a casino that is to be expected. Decorations inside were very nice. It is a given with a casino that a restaurant should be furnished as so, but there are the occasional in and out food joints as well. For a place that is focused around pizza, I was expecting more of a plastic booth and ordering counter and instead I sat in an Italian family/party style place. The Ms. liked it. The awesome service and fancy decorations were a huge plus, but as far as food is concerned, I think something other than pizza is my way to go. Look at my pictures of both pizzas (gf and regular) and make the call whether you want to try it or go with a pasta/meat route. I have not eaten anywhere else in Foxwoods, but this is the only one that really stands out.

I added chicken and asked for the lunch size portion and I am satisfied but not over full. Perfect quick lunch. We tried some pizza too, my fav is the korean bbq with a veggie slaw kind of deal with spicy pulled pork...delish  Would suggest to all.  Over night at the casino?

Seated and brought bread right away, David, our waiter, was very nice and engaging.  We had a quesadilla appetizer that wasn't super memorable, but the dipping sauce for it was really good.  Ordered the original BBQ chicken pizza. For our entree. It came out within 10 minutes and was plenty hot. Many people in other reviews said that theirs was skimpy on ingredients, we did not have that experience. The sauce was tasty, the chicken and cilantro fresh. A little too much outside crust for my liking, but hey, that's a first world problem.  My husband ordered a beer and I had a fresh strawberry mojito, one of their summer specials. I loved that it was not overly sweetened with simple syrup, they let the fresh berries do their thing.  We split a strawberry shortcake for dessert and we were both really impressed with how excellent it was. Home-made tasting biscuits, fresh berries, real whipped cream and lemon zest. We skipped the ice cream that also could have come with it, and I don't feel like we missed a thing!  Our bill was just under $40.00, not bad at all for the amount of food we got.  Over dinner, at the more expensive but lesser quality buffet, we discussed how we should have gone back to CPK for dinner. Live and learn.

However, the sandwich that I ordered, the California Club, was extremely minimal on the turkey.  In fact, when I opened up the second half that I was eating as I did not taste much turkey in the first half, only a few small tidbits fell out of that side.  I am not one to want piles of meat, but it  would have been delicious with an appropriate amount of turkey.

I had never been mostly because mom had bad luck with their frozen pizzas in the past but with a little goading this time we got to try it! Glad we did! We had excellent service, the waitstaff quick and friendly, and they even remembered my mothers mess of a drink order of how she wanted her margaritta without salt and ice on the side after I made a drink order and water with lemon. Everything came out exactly as ordered. The ambiance was clean and comfortable with my only complaint being how difficult it was to fit my womenly hips into the booth.  My seasonal strawberry mohito was great. Mom enjoyed her strawberry margaritta but commented it being a bit on the sweet side. For the food we ordered the bacon avocado southwest eggrolls and sesame ginger chicken pot stickers/dumplings. They were so delicious! The eggrolls in particular were warm and delighted my insides with happiness. The eggrolls were about $10 (you get 3 cut in half but they are pretty big) and the potstickers were $8.

Very attentive, fast, courteous and made amazing recommendations. He was so nice and a joy to have as a server. Definitely one of the best waiters I've ever had!! I started with the strawberry margarita and it was delicious! Sweet but with a potent fresh strawberry taste. We then shared the avocado egg rolls as and appetizer and it was SOOO good!!! For my entree, I couldn't decide, so David recommended I add chicken to the tostada pizza and I couldn't have been happier. The others had the fettuccine and the club sandwich..everything was tasty!! Definitely the only restaurant I need to visit at Foxwoods!! And if you come by, request David! He'll make sure your experience is superb!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mashantucket?start=20,3.48,3.48,3.48,,3.4800000000000004
53,Ashley B.,"Stamford, CT",122,20,15.0,1.0,2016-08-11,"As you can see many of these people would consider this restaurant a five star establishment, but if you'd spend a few minutes reading over what I have to say, I promise it'll save you a lot of time, energy, and moola.  My day started off great, I'd consider my economic state ""not bankrupt, but still immediately going to the clearance rack in any store"". I was scouring the Tanger outlets in hopes of some good deals, when my stomach began to growl. I am very familiar with the area as I used to live down the road and have made frequent visits to Foxwoods over the past few years. I would consider myself a frequent CPK visitor, so it was rather a no-brainer that my friend and I felt confident we would get a decent meal at a decent price there. By the time I sat down in my uncomfortable booth my stomach roared like thunder, and my mind could not focus on anything else but the meal I was about to devour. As I stated earlier, I used to make very frequent trips to CPK and always get the same order: a Bianco flatbread pizza and mac and cheese bites. The menu lists the flatbread pizza to have gorgonzola cheese on it, but I am more of a ricotta gal, so in all of my previous trips to this so-called ""restaurant"" they gladly  replaced the gorgonzola with ricotta. Now today was a little bit different, apparently they no longer have ricotta??!? No ricotta in a pizza kitchen.... I didn't want to make a fuss, so I decided to stick with the gorgonzola and mac and cheese bites, and my friend did the same. The mac and cheese bites came out at a suspiciously speedy time, but at this point my stomach was literally eating itself, so I gladly took a large mac and cheese bite to the face, but this mac and cheese bite tasted like it had been sitting on that plate for the past year. I'm not actually sure if it was covered in breading or dust. Not to mention, inside that dust was very hard and stale mac and cheese that tasted like Styrofoam. Disappointed, and still hungry, I pushed aside my full plate of mac and cheese bites as my flatbread pizza was delivered to me. After washing down that sad old mac and cheese bite with a glass of flat coke, I took a big mouthful of this pizza. Let me tell you, that was the most rotten, repulsive, disturbing tasting thing i've ever put into my mouth... and let me tell you, I am not proud of some of the things I've put into my mouth, but this, this was the worst. I couldn't even take a second bite it was so wretched. When the waitress came over to the table I was fed up, and just wanted to leave, but I hate being rude to servers so I asked for a box for the rest of my pizza so I wouldn't offend her by leaving all of this uneaten food on my plate. She brought me a box along with my check. At this point my stomach is so empty the entire restaurant could hear the echoes of its rumbling. I look at the check, the meal was $17.. that could literally buy me 113 and 1/3 chicken nuggets at burger king that are more edible than this food. $17. I was so frustrated and let down by this meal that I just signed my receipt and began to put the other slices in my take home box. as I lifted up the last slice I saw on my plate a 2 inch dark curly hair that is clearly not mine. As my gagging reflux were triggered I did not know how to handle this situation. All I remember thinking was ""I want to throw up"", So frustrated my friend and I stormed out, let down and still hungry. We proceeded to walk through the outlets to get back to our car, but we only made it a mere few feet before she was is a frantic search for a restroom. Her stomach was so upset from this food she ran to the nearest women's restroom only to find a sign saying the bathroom was closed, she was forced to use the men's room. with our hearts full of shame, and our stomachs filled with nothing, I write this post to you, potential CPK customer. I hope you think twice about all of those 5 star reviews, because I promise you, If I could have given zero stars on this website, I would have.

It was only a dollar more than the regular sangrias but was totally worth it! We also got roasted garlic chicken pizza which was really good. You know it's a good place when I actually want to share evenly with my boyfriend - when we got down to the last 3 pieces, I asked him how many he had (to make sure I got my fair share). Absolutely no complaints, but the reason for the 4 stars is that it is what it is - a fast casual, affordable pizza place in the casino.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mashantucket,3.4,3.4,3.4,,3.4000000000000004

Then the waitress asked if we wanted bread which we received after we finished the apps. It was disorganized even though the establishment wasn't even busy, with many open tables for a Saturday afternoon lunch. We ordered the following:  Avocado club egg rolls Brussels + bacon flatbread  Wild mushroom strozzapreti with chicken.  Kung pao spaghetti with chicken  Garlic cream fettuccine with shrimp  The avocado club egg rolls were delicious, lightly fried on the outside, the ranch dipping sauce with it was a great pairing.  I would not recommend the Brussels and bacon flatbread. I was expecting more Brussels but it only had a few pieces here and there on the entire flatbread, bacon was too salty.  The wild mushroom strozzapreti was good in flavor, but some of the mushroom pieces were cut way too thick. I added chicken to it for an additional $3. The chicken was dry with no flavor. They just threw a slab of chicken on top of the pasta.  I sampled the kung pao spaghetti and the garlic cream fettuccine, both standard in taste, nothing to rave about.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mashantucket,3.28,3.28,3.28,,3.2800000000000002

11,Dianne B.,"Norwich, CT",33,73,48.0,3.0,2016-12-26,"Dined at CPK - probably the 8th time over 10 years at this location. Today was the day after Christmas, and the restaurant was busy, not unusually, but a normal-busy. It was 3:25 when we put in for a table; we were told it would be about 20 minutes - it was about 30 minutes which wasn't too bad, but once seated in the restaurant it was apparent that the bus-service was slowing things down, i.e. there were a lot of vacant tables that needed to be cleared and cleaned. Our server was very busy but he attended to us, at first, promptly. We ordered our drinks, appetizers and entrees all at once. The drinks and appetizer came fairly quickly, but it went downhill after that, service-wise. Once we finished the appetizer (chicken, sesame, ginger dumplings which were good but a little slimy), no one cleared our dishes until our entrees were served which was a good 30 minutes later - too long between courses, for clearing the dirty dishes as well as waiting for the entree. We each had the Jambalaya which didn't disappoint - it is always consistent and delicious. We also ordered the thai chicken pizza which was so-so - it used to be more flavorful with more sauce, but now it has mostly julienned vegetables on top and little chicken/sauce. After we requested the check and to-go box, the waiter hustled at a normal/expected service-level. Again (if the restaurant manager is reading this), the downfalls were: #1 bus-boy speed at clearing tables and #2 the kitchen's ability to keep up with the orders.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mashantucket,3.24,3.24,3.24,,3.2400000000000007

Awesome.  Very happy with how quickly the wait was(not much room to wait on a busy night like New Years).  We are promptly seated by a pretty unfriendly hostess at a nice large table. I take my menu photo as the manager walks by and says ""hey that's copyright infringement""    Not sure why or what he said it for... I took several minutes for our server to come by. Again it was insanely busy so it was fine it certainly wasn't an unreasonable amount of time. She was very friendly and fast to bring our drinks.  Unfortunately after the drinks and our order was placed we didn't see her again until the check came.   I ordered a Hawaiian pizza thin and crispy...this is where the four stars comes in.  I'm pretty sure this was the best pizza I've ever had.  I loved it. It was perfect. Crispy, delicious, cheesy heaven. Lol.  Seriously though this thin crispy pizza is insane.  I'm mad now because I'll have to drive an hour and a half to get more.   Considering tonight was New Years I will give them a pass on the relatively poor service, I definitely understand people get stressed on super busy nights like tonight.  Go here.

We ordered the Spinach/artichoke dip, which actually was pretty good. Needed some salt- overall decent. Waiter asked us if we wanted bread, sure why not? Well, about 3 or 4 other tables have sat after us (which he also waited on) and we never got it. He served it to all his other tables though...no biggie? When they dropped the spin dip, I asked the waitress for it. It appears, this really pissed this waiter off - because he  then came and slammed it on the table- like we were inconveniencing him. He also didn't give us any oil/butter with it - like everybody else had. Previous to this trip, I never visited a CPK, So I had no idea if they served this w/ every entrée or not? But anyway- that is the service aspect of this trip. Hubs ordered a some shrimp/pasta dish and liked it. I really loved my meal, which was a pasta and veggie dish- served w/ cut up asparagus. It was delicious. I guess besides the crappy service, I would probably go back and try it out again if we wanted dinner.
