91,Melinda C.,"Alexandria, VA",111,266,23.0,4.0,2012-01-20,"California usually equates to one thing when it comes to food, and that is avocado! To all restaurants: If California is part of the name of a menu item, and there is no avocado listed in the ingredients, your business sucks and you're running it WRONG! (I've seen this situation once). Back to California Pizza Kitchen. The only thing I've ever ordered from this establishment, and the only thing I ever will order, is the California Club: chicken, bacon, and avocado. Best combination ever. I'm pretty sure almost a whole avocado goes on this pizza, which I love, because I can never have too much avocado. I literally eat whole avocados as a snack. I just peel off the skin and munch on the thing as is. Amazing. The avocados on CPK's pizzas are always really fresh, which should be a given, but I once ordered a ""California Dream"" from a little cafe, and the avocados in the sandwich were not ripe (hard and more white than green in color). That was the biggest disappointment ever, so CPK gets extra points for having some scrumptious avocado. I often order to go because I'm usually at the mall alone and am more comfortable sitting in those tables for two in the food court area by myself rather than inside the restaurant. I find it kind of odd that when ordering to go, they put the lettuce, avocado, and tomato that should be topping the pizza in a separate container. Maybe so the lettuce doesn't get too warm on the way home? Anyway, I never actually take the to go pizza home, so this is a tad bit annoying for me. I don't want to have to spend any extra time putting the avocado on my pizza. I just want to eat it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mclean?start=100,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.9600000000000004,3.1600000000000006

99,Mr. P.,"Falls Church, VA",0,17,9.0,3.0,2012-06-14,"Solid restaurant, nothing spectacular but I would probably go back if I were near CPK and craving Pizza.  The Food is very hit and miss. I ordered the Mac n Cheese bites and they were absolutely horrendous. Being someone who hates wasting food it was almost a chore to have to finish the Mac N Cheese bites. Would not recommend to anyone. They were overly greasy and sour. Not a good option. As far as the Pizza's they are decent but nothing spectacular. Essentially they taste just like a step up from frozen Pizza's. I do love though the variety of Pizza toppings. The California club Pizza is exactly like it sounds like, lettuce, avocado, ranch dressing etc. The Thai pizza with bean sprouts is also delicious. Again good tasting Pizza's but nothing spectacular. It definitely though is absolutely overpriced. You will be paying $15-$25/Pizza for what is essentially a personal Pizza served on a plate. I wouldn't advice splitting one Pizza because it will probably leave you hungry.  This place however does get extremely high marks on it's tiramisu. Call me crazy because I have eaten dozens of Tiramisu at high end Italian restaurants but to me the Tiramisu here rivals with any I have had, and shockingly maybe the best. I would come to CPK just for their Tiramisu. They also have delicious homemade lemonades.  All in All this is a solid lunch option. Ok Pizza's but overpriced, and one dessert that scores high from me. I will go here from time to time. Service seems adequate although I did watch as one lady couldn't find her credit card and was looking all over. Under tables, on the seats, and the server ensured her that he had given her back her credit card. After they had looked for maybe 10 minutes he finally went to check back at the register where he should have in the first place and lay and behold he never gave her card back to her. Needless to say if that had happened to me I would be incredibly irate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mclean?start=100,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.732,3.1600000000000006

Our server asked what we wanted to drink and brought them to our table, but then disappeared for a while before she came back to take our order. We got the spinach and artichoke dip for an appetizer, and it was delicious. For the main course, I ordered the fettucini alfredo with chicken and my boyfriend ordered the original bbq pizza. Mine was alright, very bland, but my boyfriend's pizza was amazing. The crust was like nothing i've ever tasted. It was soft for pizza, but it went so well with the flavors.

So I decided to try it again as I don't remember my previous dining experience. Let me start by saying that we were really famished when we came in so my personal judgment may be somewhat biased. Ok, we ordered three kinds of pizza and while they were flavorful and all, I didn't like the crust at all. It was kind of hard and chewy and just caused mandibular discomfort.

I also got it on wheat crust because I'm pretending to be healthy at a pizza place. When the pizza came out it basically looked like a pizza with salad dumped on top. I picked off some of the greens with a fork before I ate the pizza because otherwise everything would just fall off as soon as I picked up a slice. The wheat crust was good considering it was wheat, and I could've eaten half of the pizza and been full. But someone challenged me to finish the whole thing so obviously I did.  Oh you also got bread and oil before your meal, so that's a plus. The service was good and again, no complaints.

I have never been treated so horribly at CPK in the past until I came to this location. We came in around 5 pm on a weekday (not rush hour) and it was quite empty inside the restaurant. While looking over the menu I see 2 or 3 waiters walk by thinking they were going to introduce themselves and ask what we would like to drink. Nope, completely ignored with each passing. I flag down the host to find my waitress and she eventually strolls over. No smile, no introduction, no apology for the lack of service. She immediately asks what we want to order and walks away. We were shocked by her lack of enthusiasm and service. We didn't even get water until we had to ask for it! The most disturbing thing was that our waitress was extremely nice and provided great service to the table of non-asians in front of my table. Maybe it was a racism issue? I know I can't make assumptions but you can't help to wonder about these things when you're in that type of situation.  Food was okay but the experience was definitely ruined by the poor service. I kept seeing the wait staff act extremely unprofessional. They were fooling around, smirking, and whispering at each other while staring at customers. I felt really uncomfortable and wondered if they were gossiping about the customers.  At the end of my meal, I requested to speak with the manager about my experience. He was extremely apologetic and assured me that he will address the poor service we experienced. I mentioned to him that there are many other yelp reviews making claims about the poor service and that this may be an ongoing problem that is now difficult to fix. He sort of shrugged it off and told me he doesn't believe in yelp. Hey, to each his own I guess. He did give me a $15 gift card to go back but I have been extremely hesitant.

Both it and the bread were delicious and honestly that alone could've kept me happy for a while but I had a free birthday dessert so i got a chocolate souffle cake. It used to be even better with an amazing vanilla bean sauce but it's still delicious tho since the change i definitely get it much less.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mclean,3.6,3.28,3.28,,3.4080000000000004
14,Alexis Y.,"沖縄県, Japan",70,2,,1.0,2017-08-11,"I would not give this CPK a star if I could, I have gone to many different CPKs with phenomenal service and excellent food. My family and I dined in this restaurant on a Friday night around 6pm, the restaurant was not busy for the time on a weekend. But this location in McLean was greatly disappointing. The waitress hardly served my table and when she did she was barely talking to us or cared about the food allergies we had. Other waiters were standing near by in a large group congregating having their own conversations and not serving other tables. By the time my family had received out orders we still had not gotten the courtesy bread when we asked three times for it, patiently waiting. As we finished our meal we asked again and another waitress was very reluctant in doing so. The original waitress never checked up on our meals or if we needed a drink refill. From previous comments and reviews about this location, other yelpers are correct about this restaurant. New management is needed followed by training for the entire staff.  We are usually large tippers in this case we hardly left a dime. It's too bad about this location, Tyson's Corner is a higher end luxury mall with a mediocre CPK. Highly do not recommend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mclean,3.6,3.26,3.26,,3.3960000000000004
15,Francis O.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",174,80,,2.0,2017-08-30,"Came here for dinner with the family and ordered the rib-eye steak. Asked for the steak to be cooked ""medium"". Immediately after my first bite, I realized that my steak was cooked ""well done"". Pretty disappointed in that, but I let that pass. Unfortunately, tonight's service was not great. We had to wait about 20 minutes to find a server to give us extra napkins. It took us having to speak with the greeter to find our server. One star, for the greeter being accommodating by giving us a booth to sit in. And another star, because my daughter enjoyed her mac & cheese.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mclean,3.52,3.25,3.25,,3.358

Our server was very friendly and we had a great conversation with her. They served us the complimentary bread & dipping oil. Our food came in quickly as well. It was hot and fresh.

I just ordered the new, short rib and Smokey Mac and cheese. For $22 I expect a little more than braised beef over a box of Kraft Mac & cheese!  I will give them credit for the tender short rib, but still not worth the price. I don't understand how they're still open.

1,Joela A.,"Centreville, VA",162,22,5.0,4.0,2018-01-03,The menu has changed a bit over the years and is constantly changing.  Lots of options and the apps can get filling so don't order too much.  BBQ chicken salad with avocado is good but I hate paying that much for a salad 15.99 plus extra for avocado  It's a big salad and can be shared.  Not the cheapest dining option at tysons but better priced than sit down restaurants.  Great for apps and meal but they need more options for dessert.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mclean,3.36,3.29,3.29,,3.318
0,Rebecca M.,"Vienna, VA",390,339,279.0,4.0,2018-01-06,"I'm a fan of this casual quick-turn table service mall eatery!    Past the crowded counters of cheap, greasy, calorie-laden fast food eats in the Tyson's I lower food court corridor, this bastion of rustic comfort is located right by the entrance/exit doors. There's a convenient place for strollers outside the doors and plenty on booths and distressed wood table seating inside.  I don't mind grabbing food on the run and don't even mind plastic or styrofoam containers but I really prefer to dine with stainless utensils instead of plastic ones. It just makes the food taste better imho.  The pizzas, salads and pastas are quite nice and there is a M-F lunch duo for $9! But when the cold winds blow and my nose and toes are frozen, nothing warms my soul like a bowl of piping hot soup--like the rich and flavorful Sedona Tortilla offered by California Pizza Kitchen.  With a lovely vine-ripened Roma tomato base and just the right amount of chicken, corn and pepper, this soup hits the spot and chases away the chill. Add an affordable glass of wine and I'm ready to be patient enough for standing in line amid the winter mall crowds before I head back out into the Arctic Tundra that used to be the Lord and Taylor parking lot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mclean,3.32,3.3,3.3,,3.3080000000000003
