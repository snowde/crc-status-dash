I've thought long and hard about it but I think it's important that this feedback be shared.  A couple of weeks ago a friend and I met here for dinner. I don't want to go into details but here's what you should know. There is a certain waiter here who needs some basic customer service training.  It's fun to occasionally joke with your waiter but there is a flow when you are at a restaurant and your server should be busy enough that they don't have a lot of time to socialize at your table. This was not the case. Though we tried to politely indicate that we weren't there to socialize with him, he wouldn't ""take the hint."" Things got weird, uncomfortable, and awkward. He slammed the dessert menu on our table!  He got angry and said some strange things. I'm no Psychology major but I took enough in college to know that he's bordering on sociopath.  When we complained to the manager, we never got an apology. We got some excuses, ""He's the best waiter we have, etc."" Umm...Really?!  To be fair, he did comp our meal which was nice.

Frankly, the pizza tasted like a frozen pizza.  ""Made fresh"" should have a lot more flavor.  Sadly, it didn't.  Perhaps trying other dishes would be better here.  Maybe they are being too diverse and need to focus on the fundamentals....they have tacos, for Pete's sake!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mesa,2.72,2.72,2.72,2.7,2.72

34,R. S.,"Mesa, AZ",0,8,,1.0,2016-05-12,"Met my wife for lunch here. We each ordered a bowl of soup and a half sandwich. With hardly anyone in the place we waited 25 minutes for our food. Actually I had to ask the waitress to bring the soup so we could begin eating. The soup, Pea Barley, was tasteless. It was hot and thick with no taste. Finally, the sandwiches arrived. My wife's, a crusty chicken, was cold inside. Apparently, the chicken is frozen and then sometimes cooked. There is nothing to say about mine, the turkey with brie, because there is nothing to say. This place takes no pride in their sandwiches, in fact, there are only four on the menu, variations of two chicken and two turkey. Our Ice Tea and Soda were $3 each. So, for this grand meal, the charge was $28 including tax. Apparently, if you go to a Pizza Kitchen, you'd better order pizza. Very unsatisfying lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mesa?start=20,2.64,2.64,2.64,2.6280000000000006,2.64

So as the evening continued we sit down and are waiting for the server to come for our drink order for about 15 minutes, but never showed up, but instead a manager comes and brings us a flat bread for it being our first time eating there and it will be my last time as well. Finally the server comes about 5 minutes after the flatbread arrived and takes our drink order and it takes another 10 minutes for him to return with our drinks (which we ordered two waters) and the rest of the night continues like this.

This time it fell a little flat. The crust was burnt and reminded me of box pizza. Don't get me wrong it was still pretty good I just remembered it a bit differently. But the real reason for the 3 star bc nothing really deserved it was the shear fact that within a couple hours I swelled up like a wet diaper. I had to remove my shoes it was that bad. Outside of that the service and staff were great.

We were awestruck when the kitchen manager Rafael gave us a free complimentary appetizer. Wow. What a rarity these days. The appetizer and pizza were great. The pizza was unique. We had the California club pizza. What is amazing about California Pizza is the experimentation of what we call Pizza. If you are looking for a unique pizza dining experience this is one to have. Not your same old pizza.  Thanks to the wait staff, chefs, and Rafael for giving us a wonderful dining experience.

They seem to have changed their recipes for pizzas several times over the past few years, and not for the better. The crust, in particular, is just not very good. They also skimp on cheese and toppings.  I noticed that some reviews for this location state that customers received excellent service. This has not been the case for us at all the last few times. The servers we've had are not rude, just completely lacking in customer service. Your drinks sit empty on the table for long stretches of time, and it feels like you're always having to hunt your server down for anything and everything you need. Items you request are sometimes forgotten. I see this as poor  management and training.  Since the menu items here are on the expensive side and do not match the price point in taste and quality, I don't see us coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mesa,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92

The food took more time than expected to get to us, but it was worth the wait.  The only complaints I have are 1) the service was slower than  prior visits and 2) our server was clearing the table and rather than going to the left of me to clear some dishes, he actually reached over from my right side to clear them ... right in front of my face as I was taking a bite of pizza!  It was awkward!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mesa,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004

The time before that would have been about 10 years in between as well. Landed here the other night.  Decor looked the same. Menu: darned if I could tell if anything has ever changed. Clean. Friendly but distracted staff. World Series on TV. Thai chicken and BBQ chicken pizzas on hand-tossed crusts. Nice flavors. Reasonable quantities of proteins. Fair price.  For dessert, nearby staff all chimed in at once and said that we had to have the butter cake. OK. Before I realized what had happened the server had cleverly up-sold the order to include the ice cream. I probably would have said yes no matter what. But, I didn't realize on the spot that was an up-charge. So, here's the thing: if you read others of my reviews, I'm pretty consistent. I want dessert! I need to have it offered or I won't order it (because, ""do you want fries and a Coke with that should be automatic up-sell language for any server all the time). I am a card carrying choco-holic. I would have liked for a bit of a run down of the choices. The butter cake isn't all that. OK. It's not bad. The ice cream was frost bitten with ice crystals in it. And, more importantly, the scoop, which looked huge, was only a 1/2 scoop. Buzz kill! After the server asked our opinion, to which I said ""it was alright,"" she said she hadn't heard that harsh a criticism of it ever. I explained it needed chocolate. She then said, ""oh, you should have ordered the chocolate souffle."" Well, too late! It's not that I won't come back. I probably will.
