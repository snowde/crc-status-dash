5,Athena K.,"Detroit, MI",264,461,280.0,1.0,2012-03-31,"Being located in an airport is no excuse for delivering subpar food. The BBQ chicken pizza was soggy, cheese was not melted in the middle, and only a few pitiful flakes of cilantro were sprinkled around the sad, burnt edges.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-miami,,,,,
6,Benjamin E.,"Union Square, San Francisco, CA",0,9,,1.0,2012-08-03,"THATS NOT A CALIFORNIA PIZZA KITCHEN!!!! I've been in different locations of this Chain,... but what I met at the airport yesterday was just a FastFood Store like a BurgerKing or a McDonalds...!! So don't go there if you expect the Quality Service and feeling like in a CPK everywhere else... It's a big pity that this chain, makes little stores like this! Even the personal there was pretty unfriendly! I mean, unfriendly like everywhere else in fast food stores like this!! you rather go to subway and get what you always get from SUBWAY than go there and have a bad image 'bout CPK",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-miami,,,,,
4,Jerry G.,"Tucson, AZ",19,546,162.0,3.0,2013-03-08,This is an OK place to eat outside of security.  The only problem is they are a bit pricey even for an airport.  They have a limited menu and if you are their late the premake only a few pizzas so the selection is even less.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-miami,,,,,
1,Naty S.,"Miami, FL",64,143,244.0,1.0,2015-11-10,"What an impact a waitress can make on the overall image of a restaurant. We came as a family for Pizza with a Purpose night to benefit out kids Elementary school. What a disaster! I really hope that it was worth it for the school... The waitress had a bit of an ""I don't really care attitude"" I don't blame her it was full of kids running around and a severely understaffed restaurant...  Regardless writing an order down is pretty simple. Our order came in an odd time, wrong, and times where forgotten.  If you see this place packed walk away...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-miami,,,,,
3,Sheila L.,"Miami, FL",0,2,,1.0,2015-11-10,"This is the baddest place in the word!!!! I can't tell you about the food because we didn't get it in TWO hours!!! They don't even care if we are living... We are with my daughter of 5 years old, and she don't stop to ask me wen comes the food!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-miami,,,,,
2,Sergio R.,"Miami Beach, FL",12,4,,1.0,2016-01-05,"Now I do understand the why you guys have a poorly one and half star ranking. I show up in your counter at 6.40 pm on Jan 05 2016 motivated by the grat looking pizza but the guest service person had this so horrible actitud like we were bothering her, she didn't even turn arround but ask laud what we want?.. so we left right on saying its Ok. Please headquarters hire a decent HR that can select costumer service personal to attend your nice pizza places.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-miami,,,,,
