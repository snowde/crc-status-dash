277,Jennifer M.,"Mililani Town, United States",176,32,,3.0,2017-01-04,"Three stars. But, they're still in their first week so I'll have to give them another try. I made an online order tonight and had been quoted a 20 minute wait time.  I had never used their online order form before, so I was surprised at how easy it was.  I arrived at 10 pm on Saturday night and had no problem snagging a parking spot right in the front of the restaurant.  The hostess at the front was extremely helpful.  I appreciate that she walked me to where the take out cashiers were located instead of pointing and saying ""take out orders can be picked up there"" then sending me on my way.  As we walked through the restaurant, every employee smiled and/or greeted me.  The two cashiers at the take out counter were also polite and helpful.  My only two issues were: 1.  I was quoted a 20 minutes wait time for my take out order.  However, I actually ended up waiting when I arrived and didn't get my order until 40 minutes after it was placed online.  I was on my way to work so this was more of an issue tonight than it normally would have been for me. 2.  I didn't receive any bread with my order.  I know I specifically requested it when I placed the order, so I'm not sure why it wasn't in my bag. Other than that, the food was great and the customer service was on point.  I can overlook the issues I encountered on this visit and say I'll definitely give them another chance.  They've been open for barely a week, so I'll cut them some slack :) * Side Note: There is a separate entrance for take out orders that is located on the side, closest to Times, facing the parking lot.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=60,3.1800000000000006,3.1800000000000006,3.1800000000000006,3.1800000000000006,3.1800000000000006

Anyway, since it's less than a week old, of course there's a long wait on a Saturday night. We waited a little over an hour for our table, but we were quoted an hour and twenty minutes originally anyway. As soon as we walked in, three different people apologized for the long wait. We got seated and was greeted right away from our waitress Alika who was amazing. Despite being super busy, she was very friendly and polite. In fact, all of the staff I encountered tonight was. Our food came out rather quickly and was delicious. The carne asada pizza was life changing! It was so good, I don't have any pictures of it because it left the plate so quickly. All in all, it was worth the long wait for a table. I will definitely be returning. And if you happen to have Alika as your server, you won't be disappointed.

We ordered our pizzas for take out and was told they would be ready in 19 minutes, 40 minutes later I'm still sitting outside waiting on my pizzas.... No sorry I was told I'm waiting on the salad, so the pizzas take 19 minutes and apparently a salad takes 40+ minutes. It was like this the last time I came and I thought maybe it was just that night, apparently not. Ridiculous. Update. So when the Pizzas can out they were cold so now they are remaking them.  Update.

248,Michael M.,"Honolulu, United States",123,38,88.0,3.0,2017-02-04,"4/1/2017 It's a Saturday night and yes, they're just in their first week of opening.   We checked in with the front table, was told it'll be an hour wait and they will send us a text message when it's ready.   Which is fine, but remind you that there is a few tables that's been open for awhile.  4 tables which could seat 4 people each is open right at this moment.   So we walk around for about 45 mins, and finally come back to see that those 4 tables are still unseated.  We wait a bit more longer and finally decided to check back in with the front table, was told that it would be another 20 mins wait.  What the.....?!?? Are you serious?   As we wait a bit longer, I take a peek inside and there is 3 booths that's open, the same 4 tables that is open. And 2, 6 person tables open. We heard some other people near us also complaining, how come they are taking so long to seat people?   So we finally got a seat. Which took about an hour an a half. As we waited, they brought us the usual bread with oil. We start handing out the plates and from the looks of it, most of it seemed dirty as they had some black and brown spots.   The waitress takes our order. Not gonna mention the whole order. Anyways, we got the appetizers and we got most of our drinks. Well just the waters.  About 20 mins later, were still wondering where is our other soft drinks. I guess the waitress forgot what we ordered and asked us what we ordered.  We get our order, which the food is great. After we're almost done eating.  The waitress asks us if we need to box our leftovers, which we said yes.  A few of our cups of drinks is all empty. I mention to the waitress we need more drinks. She nods her head and walks away going to pack our leftovers. After she packs all of it. She asks us if we need a desert menu. I said no, but could we get more refills please. She then reacts and was like ""oh I'm sorry I forgot. What did you order again?"" Overall, customer service wasn't up to par as the other CPK. Food on the other hand was excellent.  If customer service was better (hoping they will get better) I would of gave 5 stars but knocked off two stars cause of it.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=40,3.436,3.436,3.436,3.436,3.436
275,Krisanda N.,"Mililani, United States",69,23,12.0,3.0,2017-02-05,"Updating this review because I finally got to try out the Mililani location. Eh.... it's alright. Our server kept forgetting things. And the tables are so close together here so I can hear conversations from the table behind me. I felt like our server was favoring the other table behind us for some reason (the way she interacts and communicates with them vs when she came by our table)  Anyway, I thought I'd give this location a shot but honestly the pearlridge location is better. I ordered the BBQ chopped salad- the chicken was dry and the lettuce was not crisp.

338,Kendall S.,"Mililani, United States",141,39,434.0,5.0,2017-02-06,"Food is just as good as all the others, just the setting is much more convenient for me. Seems a lot larger than Pearlridge, Ala Moana and Waikiki. Not sure if it seats more than Kapolei. Pretty sure it's smaller than Kahala since Kahala has the ""outside of restaurant"" seating. The outdoor seating is awesome on a cool evening or even a warm one with a small breeze. Food is typical CPK good stuff. Newer menu items and ""specials"" or ""seasonal"" dishes always deserve a go.

260,L M.,"Honolulu, United States",0,8,33.0,1.0,2017-02-09,"I will start by saying that I have always been a fan of CPK until fairly recently. Salads at CPK were my favorite but I feel that they have changed the recipes. The salads don't taste the same, not to mention that the knife skills on the salad are very sloppy. In our BBQ chopped salad we had huge pieces of jicama that were the size of quarters.  I recently went to get takeout from the Mililani location and there was a new menu item. It was a white fish dish. This was over $25 and it was insanely small. I expect far more for something of this price and the quality was not great.

She asked if there was anything I I needed.  I told her that the bread she said she was going to bring at the time of my order would be great. She said she would get that right out and her manager was aware of the problem. 10 minutes later, the bread finally came. She said it just came out of the oven.  10 minutes later our food finally arrived.  By now, I had been waiting 45 minutes. When I got my check, I was surprised that they didn't offer to comp something or offer a comp desert or anything.  All I got was ""thanks for waiting guys."" I expect more from CPK.

We went for lunch so we were seated within 5-10 minutes. The hostess Dakota was awesome and very helpful in getting us checked in.  Once inside, the decor was great; much like the new CPK in Kapolei. It's so great to no longer see only black, white and yellow tile everywhere. They also had beautiful pictures of Hawaii all over the walls and surfboards mounted near the bar. The booth seating, which we got, was extremely comfortable and there was a TV in the area we were sitting as well. The bar looked like a well stocked bar and had a decent amount of seating which is always great! They also have two TV's mounted for all you avid sports fans! The staff was extremely friendly and everyone took the time to stop and check on us, including the managers. While I appreciate attentive service, getting checked on every two minutes can be a little much, especially when you're trying to have a conversation. Overall, awesome service though! Everyone is really nice and willing to get you what you need even if they're not your server.  We ordered some La Marca Prosecco to start (be advised there is a small portion that you can order listed in the menu; the general manager tried to say that we could only order it by the full size bottle, but there is a 6 oz. available!). We then ordered the white corn guacamole and bianco flatbread for appetizers, which was delicious! The guacamole did need more salt, but it's available at the table for you.  For the main course we ordered the BBQ Chicken Pizza and the Santa Fe salad which is on the seasonal portion of the menu and currently only available at the Mililani location because the other CPK's have not gotten it yet! The Santa Fe salad was delicious! It has spinach, farro, red cabbage, avocado, beans, corn, shaved peppers and grilled chicken with a jalapeño ranch dressing. The BBQ pizza was delicious as always and all of our food came out fairly quickly! For dessert we ordered the salted caramel pudding which was delicious as always. It seemed like the pudding didn't get enough time to set, as the pudding was slightly runny and not quite pudding yet. Nonetheless, it was still good.

But, I decided to chance it and brought my dad here for lunch.  The restaurant itself isn't very big as most of the restaurant is comprised of their large patio. We were greeted by the host who said the wait was 20 minutes. Relived it was only 20 minutes, we decided to wait. While we waited, we checked out the inside of the restaurant and noticed all of the staff that were on duty. We observed the managers checking in on patrons and efficient staff promptly clearing tables. Needless to say, we were impressed.  Before we knew it, it was time to be seated and we were quickly greeted by our server. Since we had time to figure out what we want to eat, we immediately ordered our food. Despite the restaurant being busy, our food arrived rather quickly. While we enjoyed our meal, we were frequently asked how we were doing or if we needed anything. It was really nice to have such friendly and attentive servers.  My experience here today changed my opinion on CPK. I had vowed to not dine at CPK after the bad experiences I had at the Kapolei location. But, not all locations are the same. We had an awesome meal with excellent service here at the Mililani location. Despite just opening four days ago, things seem to be running pretty smoothly. The staff are well trained and efficient.

But, I decided to chance it and brought my dad here for lunch.  The restaurant itself isn't very big as most of the restaurant is comprised of their large patio. We were greeted by the host who said the wait was 20 minutes. Relived it was only 20 minutes, we decided to wait. While we waited, we checked out the inside of the restaurant and noticed all of the staff that were on duty. We observed the managers checking in on patrons and efficient staff promptly clearing tables. Needless to say, we were impressed.  Before we knew it, it was time to be seated and we were quickly greeted by our server. Since we had time to figure out what we want to eat, we immediately ordered our food. Despite the restaurant being busy, our food arrived rather quickly. While we enjoyed our meal, we were frequently asked how we were doing or if we needed anything. It was really nice to have such friendly and attentive servers.  My experience here today changed my opinion on CPK. I had vowed to not dine at CPK after the bad experiences I had at the Kapolei location. But, not all locations are the same. We had an awesome meal with excellent service here at the Mililani location. Despite just opening four days ago, things seem to be running pretty smoothly. The staff are well trained and efficient.  Mahalo to the staff at CPK Mililani, we'll be back for more great meals here!

I made an online order tonight and had been quoted a 20 minute wait time.  I had never used their online order form before, so I was surprised at how easy it was.  I arrived at 10 pm on Saturday night and had no problem snagging a parking spot right in the front of the restaurant.  The hostess at the front was extremely helpful.  I appreciate that she walked me to where the take out cashiers were located instead of pointing and saying ""take out orders can be picked up there"" then sending me on my way.  As we walked through the restaurant, every employee smiled and/or greeted me.  The two cashiers at the take out counter were also polite and helpful.  My only two issues were: 1.  I was quoted a 20 minutes wait time for my take out order.  However, I actually ended up waiting when I arrived and didn't get my order until 40 minutes after it was placed online.  I was on my way to work so this was more of an issue tonight than it normally would have been for me. 2.  I didn't receive any bread with my order.  I know I specifically requested it when I placed the order, so I'm not sure why it wasn't in my bag. Other than that, the food was great and the customer service was on point.  I can overlook the issues I encountered on this visit and say I'll definitely give them another chance.  They've been open for barely a week, so I'll cut them some slack :) * Side Note: There is a separate entrance for take out orders that is located on the side, closest to Times, facing the parking lot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=60,3.72,3.72,3.72,3.1800000000000006,3.7200000000000006

Are you serious?   As we wait a bit longer, I take a peek inside and there is 3 booths that's open, the same 4 tables that is open. And 2, 6 person tables open. We heard some other people near us also complaining, how come they are taking so long to seat people?   So we finally got a seat. Which took about an hour an a half. As we waited, they brought us the usual bread with oil. We start handing out the plates and from the looks of it, most of it seemed dirty as they had some black and brown spots.   The waitress takes our order. Not gonna mention the whole order. Anyways, we got the appetizers and we got most of our drinks. Well just the waters.  About 20 mins later, were still wondering where is our other soft drinks. I guess the waitress forgot what we ordered and asked us what we ordered.  We get our order, which the food is great. After we're almost done eating.  The waitress asks us if we need to box our leftovers, which we said yes.  A few of our cups of drinks is all empty. I mention to the waitress we need more drinks. She nods her head and walks away going to pack our leftovers. After she packs all of it. She asks us if we need a desert menu. I said no, but could we get more refills please. She then reacts and was like ""oh I'm sorry I forgot. What did you order again?"" Overall, customer service wasn't up to par as the other CPK.

So I recognize bad, good, and great service when I see it.  Yesterday afternoon I came in and with my two nieces to have a nice lunch, we were greeted by our hostess who was very welcoming and right off the back offered if we wanted to dine in or outside, we chose to sit inside. We get to our table and the hostess explained to me about the DOUGH membership, she was a little inaccurate about what she said but she hit the main points lol. A few minutes later our waitress Cheyenne(I had to ask her her name she didn't give us a spiel) she started us off with drinks and didn't explain the menu or the kids menu. But being industry I knew what I was doing. For some reason I could tell she was judging me by my appearance or maybe my age , some ignorant service workers do that, but I believe in serving people as if I were serving myself. She then comes back and mumbles something about appetizers and before I could even order an appetizer she walks away. Comes back a few minutes later and asks if we're ready, so by this time I just need to get my nieces fed. I ordered a cheese pizza and a Thai salad (so yummy) I'm never disappointed with the food when I dine at cpk and for the most part I get amazing service. But to feel judged in a place I come to all the time and being in the industry isn't acceptable to me. I am a very generous tipper but I definitely consider the service that I get. Back to my experience, food comes out I order a glass of wine took about 15 minutes to get there by then my craft is warm, doesn't check on us the whole entire meal , nor does she refill my water or nieces fruit punches, but in watching her service all her other tables and treating hen like royalty lol. I also ordered a ""potato wedge"" for my girls to share but they were just roasted potatoes so I'm guessing she didn't know the difference, I wanted to immediately send them back because they had no flavor so we weren't gonna eat it; normally I don't send things back I'll just pay it because I know that's annoying on the servers end, but at this point I could care less. So finally when we're ready to box up she comes and asks for a box(rushing us) and told her we didn't like the wedges, she smiled and took them to her manager 10 ft away from us and snobbishly said ""they didn't like them"".

Right away he left a bad taste in my mouth. No proper introduction. Jumped right into drinks and orders. He also immediately pointed out that he will also be helping out that large party of women as well. It was almost a warning. Like, he's gonna be busy.  We wanted to take our time and relax. He took a big pad of paper out. Set it down in top of our table and began to recite and write down everything we ordered. A little awkward for him have his note pad on our table. We ordered fried Mac and cheese. They brought out a regular bowl of Mac and cheese to us twice before we got the fried Mac that we ordered. It was dry and not very good at all. My club style pizza (which I've had a few times at other locations) was dry and kind of burnt. But we still ate it. Spike didn't check to see how the apps were so we just said whatever and ate it. He seemed to be worried about the large party next to us a little more. I asked a glass of the Meiomi pino noir. He says ""which one is that?"". Hmmm shouldn't you at least know your wines by the glass?

91,Jeff G.,"Mililani, HI",17,2,,2.0,2017-04-26,"Went to this location per my wife's suggestion with my family of 4 on a Tuesday at 630. Was told there would be a 30 minute wait despite no other customers waiting and there being multiple 4 and 6 person tables open. Against my better judgment, I decided to wait the 30 minutes and get a text.  30 minutes go by and I still haven't got a text about a table opening up, so we go to ask the hostess what's going on. She seems suprised by our presence and says we will be the next available table... how convenient...  I look around and notice there are still plenty of tables open and not many customers waiting. On top of that, there seems to be a lack of wait staff for current customers. I trusted my gut this time, as I knew it would take forever to get waited on and have our food delivered, so I opted to cut our losses and go somewhere else.  I get that it's a Tuesday and they don't want a full wait staff, but would it really kill them to have an extra member or two working week nights so that the open tables can be sat? It seems silly to lose a family of 4+ because CPK has poor business planning and can't staff their restaurant to support the demand within the first month of opening!  A similar experience happened to me 10 years ago at a CPK in Boulder, CO, where we waited forever to be seated and it took over an hour to get our expensive, barely topped pizza. I vowed from that day to never eat at a CPK again, but here I am to show the wife what a joke this chain is. Their service is mind boggling slow. I have no clue why people enjoy this chain.  While on my soap box, the menu outside is completely devoid of pricing. Does CPK think it is a Michelin restaurant? Is their food so expensive that if I have to ask the prices, then I can't afford it? Really pointless to have a menu without prices. Good way at luring people in and sticking them with expensive food when they realize they waited forever and don't want to lose all that time waiting (sunken cost fallacy).  I will continue to avoid this chain as overpriced food with terrible service is not my cup of tea.

So we ordered  our appetizer, one pizza, and a pasta. About 15 minutes after ordering, one of the managers (female) came out to our table to tell us they ran out of the sauce for that specific pasta. She offered to make us another type of pasta and she gave a recommendation of the pesto pasta with a certain type of noodle and etc. We ask how much that would cost and she said she will take care of it .... long story short... she delivered the pesto pasta to our table, she apologized for the wait, and DIDN'T CHARGE us for the pasta in the end! When we asked another manager (male) how we would reheat the California club pizza we ordered, he gave us great suggestion on how people order the topping on the side and etc. He was very kind and service here overall was amazing!

He looked at the computer after a couple of minutes he ask us to step in. There was 3 workers standing after another minute one of them looked at us and ask us if we're the party of six. Said no then he looked at the computer and asked if we were the party of two. Said yes. And he picked up the utensils and menus. He than started looking around after another minute or two. A girl came. He gave her the utensils and menus. She then asked me if I wanted to sit in the restaurant or in the lanai. We said inside. She asked us if raised table would be okay. Said yes cause it was getting hot outside. The inside of the restaurant is set up like bar. The seating is high bar stools and a high padded bench. ( I wouldn't recommend this seating option if have trouble stepping up). Our server was cordial and took our order of spinach dip and side order of flat bread and a small salad. Our drinks came out and a couple of minutes later the spinach dip was served. Another five minutes later our salad came. Started to eat our salad and dip. After a few minutes we started to look for our server. The pita bread was to be eaten with the dip. Our server finally came our salad and dip was almost done. I asked her to cancel my order of pita bread. She was very apologetic and said she would go and get it. Told her we were done and to pack our dip to go. A few minutes later a manager came with a new spinach dip with our pita bread. Told him that we asked our server to pack our dip and left over chips to go. He apologized and left.

Eventually she did ask the manager and the manager allowed it.  Food was good but please guys if you're not sure just ask someone that does. To me it's all about the customer experience. Will probably come back in a year or so hopefully by than they will have learned the ropes.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=20,3.04,3.37,3.37,2.8520000000000003,3.238

Especially since we were quoted 10-20 mins, then got the text saying approximately 30 mins. I HIGHLY suggest going back after your quoted time and asking where u are on the list if u haven't been called. Thinking that they had their stuff together, I went to check how much longer it would be being that 45 mins had passed and still nothing. Clearly when I asked how much longer, both hostesses that checked had that look of ""oh $H@!"" On their face and I was seated next. As we were being seated they tried to give me the ""we tried to notify you"". No. Just no. It doesn't make sense that I was able to get their initial text giving me my estimated wait time and nothing after that. I wish she had just saved it. So I started dinner irritated and with a hungry toddler. Yay. We order and the server was nice and we got drinks right away but we didn't even get bread til well over 20 mins after being seated. We actually got bread AFTER our food arrived. I didn't get a refill on my passion mango iced tea until right before we left but my one glass was really good! The food was pretty good. My chicken tequila fettuccine was at least.  I know this place isn't geared towards kids and you can tell. Note for parents considering: the only carb option they have on the kid menu is pasta. No rice. No mashed potatoes. Their grilled chicken was pretty dry as well. If your kid loves pasta then it could be a win for u though I tried my kid's alfredo and it was pretty blah. Our server did help box our leftovers which was nice.  I was super disappointed in the experience. Probably because of the reception but it just kept rolling downhill. I didn't even tip 15% and normally ALWAYS do regardless of how crappy service was cuz I know it supplements their low wages but I was just so irked with the overall service. It could be worth going for a quick lunch with no kids. I will not go there for dinner again. Ever.

Sarah our new server, not introducing herself asked if we needed anything & we had to ask for our bread.  After we ordered, a six top was seated across of us, they received their bread & appetizers before us. We had ordered a spinach artichoke dip as an app & lettuce wraps & pizzas for our entree. Everything came out at the same time, at this point we were super hungry so it was fine.  While eating our server, checked on us like 2 times. We ran out of water half way through & she walked past us like 10 times not looking at us or checking on us. I started to hold up my empty cup & she still didn't look at us for the next 10 minutes. I got up & was about to go up to ask for more water myself when she decided to stop & ask if we needed boxes. With empty cups we asked for more water & continued to eat. She came back with warm water, which also had things floating around. I then seen Danny, a server I had my first time there a few months ago. I asked him if we could get waters with ice & he gladly took our cups & came back with new ones. He's great. By then we were waiting for dessert.  We ordered butter cake with ice cream. Our butter cake was cold & our ice cream was melted. Like I said I'm not hard to please but I can't explain how bad service was. Sarah kept apologizing that it was busy but it really wasn't.

Yes there is a wait, which I already assume when I come here. I went here for dinner. I requested to sit inside (because I have come here in the past and we sat outside). The service was AMAZING! So we ordered  our appetizer, one pizza, and a pasta. About 15 minutes after ordering, one of the managers (female) came out to our table to tell us they ran out of the sauce for that specific pasta. She offered to make us another type of pasta and she gave a recommendation of the pesto pasta with a certain type of noodle and etc. We ask how much that would cost and she said she will take care of it .... long story short... she delivered the pesto pasta to our table, she apologized for the wait, and DIDN'T CHARGE us for the pasta in the end! When we asked another manager (male) how we would reheat the California club pizza we ordered, he gave us great suggestion on how people order the topping on the side and etc. He was very kind and service here overall was amazing!

If you really need Cpk, go somewhere else.  Last night we waited about 20 minutes to get in and the place was half empty. Seems like we arrived before the evening staff or they were understaffed. The person who seated us didn't smile, say hi, or anything but give us a sitting bitch face. She just walked us to a table. The next person who came by introduced herself, told us she wasn't our server, took our drink orders (beer and soft drink), then walked away. She returned with a drink for my young son and no straw. I didn't realize it so had to flag someone else down for a straw. 15 minutes later a girl stopped and asked if we had any questions. Who was this person? I guess she was our real server buy she never introduced herself or anything. 10 minutes later she stopped by again and I asked ""where's my beer?"" I finally got it after being there for 25 minutes. The place was still pretty empty.  We put in our food order and it came in reasonable time. I noticed that our particular server seemed really stressed. She had a few high maintenance tables. You know the type of people who think they're the most important people in the place and they own the wait staff? Yea, those types of idiots. Anyway, here's the worst part. There was a manager on duty, who just waltzed around with no concern or worried look on her face that some of her staff was dying. She actually walked past us about 10 times and I made eye contact with her on many occasions. I was going to ask for straw, napkins, another drink, etc. because the rest of the staff was sure to walk by as quickly as possible and avoid eye contact. Nah, this manager doesn't appear to care.

Chives on the pasta, extra sauces for salads, all add ins accounted for. Even the butter cake and vanilla ice cream.

(Must be they can't find employees to work there)  We did get greeted within 30 seconds upon walking up to the podium, and told the wait time. So we waited only about 10 minutes which was surprising! So far so good right? So we got seated, our server took about 5-7 minutes to even come over to us. ALIKA? ALEKA? Something along those lines. That was HER name.  At first impression seemed like everything would be great, took our drink order, and left. The first drinks came in a pretty timely manner, then we ordered an appetizer, the avocado chicken spring roll or something. And LET ME TELL YOU HOW FLIPPING FAST THAT SHIT CAME OUT I kid you not, it came in about 3-5 minutes....which would be great, if they actually made it for us! It was COLD!!!!!! We did eat it any way and didn't complain at the restaurant because we were all starving already haha.  So we were like ""whatever"", and ate it. So we order,  Then I have no idea what her problem was, but ALIKA ALEKA what have you her name be idk, but she literally walked past our table for 15-20 minutes without checking once, for drink refills or ANYTHING. So now I'm upset because I am in the customer service industry, and have very high standards for establishments I frequent. Food was OK, but honestly ALIKA ALEKA (an African American women with glasses) was the worst waitress I've encountered in a very long time. So airheady slow moving and seemed just lost. She was folding napkins for us instead of refilling waters, running back and forth doing who knows what when other tables were looking around for her because she was NO WHERE TO BE FOUND.  I did manage to flag her down once for a drink refill before dinner got there. But by that time this chick just rubbed is all the wrong way. Either she needs better training, personal motivation to succeed at her career/job whatever CPK is for her. Because I've never had such bad service at any CPK. It's sad. Idk if she had too many tables to watch, or what. I'm just stating our experience and how it left us feeling that night, spending our hard earned money AND tipping some one who honestly didn't deserve even a 5% tip. I had so ask another waitress for water, because ALIKA ALEKA was again no where to be found. So now as another waitress comes to fill my water, ALIKA, decides to make an appearance to finally deliver my bf's beer, and as I'm telling the OTHER waitress thank you for my water, ALIKA goes in and says YOURE WELCOME with a smile like she is doing such an awesome job....like no.  I was saying thank you to the girl that was REFILLING MY WATER. So I did make it a point to thank her after my meal when we were leaving, since ALIKA took that thank you from her. All in all, I will probably eat here again, but if we get alika I'm walking out.

The manager Tracie did come out to authorize the comps, which I really did appreciate. We went home....I really hoped it was perfect....and it was. Chives on the pasta, extra sauces for salads, all add ins accounted for. Even the butter cake and vanilla ice cream.

So I recognize bad, good, and great service when I see it.  Yesterday afternoon I came in and with my two nieces to have a nice lunch, we were greeted by our hostess who was very welcoming and right off the back offered if we wanted to dine in or outside, we chose to sit inside. We get to our table and the hostess explained to me about the DOUGH membership, she was a little inaccurate about what she said but she hit the main points lol. A few minutes later our waitress Cheyenne(I had to ask her her name she didn't give us a spiel) she started us off with drinks and didn't explain the menu or the kids menu. But being industry I knew what I was doing. For some reason I could tell she was judging me by my appearance or maybe my age , some ignorant service workers do that, but I believe in serving people as if I were serving myself. She then comes back and mumbles something about appetizers and before I could even order an appetizer she walks away. Comes back a few minutes later and asks if we're ready, so by this time I just need to get my nieces fed. I ordered a cheese pizza and a Thai salad (so yummy) I'm never disappointed with the food when I dine at cpk and for the most part I get amazing service. But to feel judged in a place I come to all the time and being in the industry isn't acceptable to me. I am a very generous tipper but I definitely consider the service that I get. Back to my experience, food comes out I order a glass of wine took about 15 minutes to get there by then my craft is warm, doesn't check on us the whole entire meal , nor does she refill my water or nieces fruit punches, but in watching her service all her other tables and treating hen like royalty lol. I also ordered a ""potato wedge"" for my girls to share but they were just roasted potatoes so I'm guessing she didn't know the difference, I wanted to immediately send them back because they had no flavor so we weren't gonna eat it; normally I don't send things back I'll just pay it because I know that's annoying on the servers end, but at this point I could care less. So finally when we're ready to box up she comes and asks for a box(rushing us) and told her we didn't like the wedges, she smiled and took them to her manager 10 ft away from us and snobbishly said ""they didn't like them"". Our bill was $42 had my service been on point I would love left a generous amount but she got 20% and that's me being nice!  Moral of this experience, don't judge your customers! We all come out to eat for a reason to eat good food, and have good service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=140,2.92,3.25,3.25,2.8600000000000003,3.118

We started off with a small girl I forget her name but she didn't seem to care for us much since she was getting off her shift after taking our orders. Sarah our new server, not introducing herself asked if we needed anything & we had to ask for our bread.  After we ordered, a six top was seated across of us, they received their bread & appetizers before us. We had ordered a spinach artichoke dip as an app & lettuce wraps & pizzas for our entree. Everything came out at the same time, at this point we were super hungry so it was fine.  While eating our server, checked on us like 2 times. We ran out of water half way through & she walked past us like 10 times not looking at us or checking on us. I started to hold up my empty cup & she still didn't look at us for the next 10 minutes. I got up & was about to go up to ask for more water myself when she decided to stop & ask if we needed boxes. With empty cups we asked for more water & continued to eat. She came back with warm water, which also had things floating around. I then seen Danny, a server I had my first time there a few months ago. I asked him if we could get waters with ice & he gladly took our cups & came back with new ones. He's great. By then we were waiting for dessert.  We ordered butter cake with ice cream. Our butter cake was cold & our ice cream was melted. Like I said I'm not hard to please but I can't explain how bad service was. Sarah kept apologizing that it was busy but it really wasn't. There was another lady that looked annoyed with our server as well. We spent two hours there... waiting on unnecessary things.

If you really need Cpk, go somewhere else.  Last night we waited about 20 minutes to get in and the place was half empty. Seems like we arrived before the evening staff or they were understaffed. The person who seated us didn't smile, say hi, or anything but give us a sitting bitch face. She just walked us to a table. The next person who came by introduced herself, told us she wasn't our server, took our drink orders (beer and soft drink), then walked away. She returned with a drink for my young son and no straw. I didn't realize it so had to flag someone else down for a straw. 15 minutes later a girl stopped and asked if we had any questions. Who was this person? I guess she was our real server buy she never introduced herself or anything. 10 minutes later she stopped by again and I asked ""where's my beer?"" I finally got it after being there for 25 minutes. The place was still pretty empty.  We put in our food order and it came in reasonable time. I noticed that our particular server seemed really stressed. She had a few high maintenance tables. You know the type of people who think they're the most important people in the place and they own the wait staff? Yea, those types of idiots. Anyway, here's the worst part. There was a manager on duty, who just waltzed around with no concern or worried look on her face that some of her staff was dying. She actually walked past us about 10 times and I made eye contact with her on many occasions. I was going to ask for straw, napkins, another drink, etc. because the rest of the staff was sure to walk by as quickly as possible and avoid eye contact. Nah, this manager doesn't appear to care.  Save yourself from having to wait long for a forgettable experience. The other Cpk's are far superior to Mililani.

But depending on the time of day, if you choose to sit outside, you could be in the sun.  So maybe check it out as you're going in as it could affect where you choose to sit. Food can pretty quickly and yup, tasted like how I expected. Consistent CPK fare and presentation. So this place is A-OK, classic CPK presentation and taste, and everything that you would expect.  So yay! Another place to eat in Mililani!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=40,2.92,3.04,3.284,2.476,2.9920000000000004

Despite all the bad reviews I've read and heard from friends and family, I decided I wanted to be fair and give them the benefit of the doubt! Well, let's just say it was a horrible experience!!! We got seated right away, BUT we sat and for 20-25 minutes, no one came to greet us or take our drink order!!!! This is when I decided that I wasn't waiting any longer! As we waited though, I noticed another table was still waiting to be greeted as well....and another table complaining that her kids didn't receive their desserts yet! Wth?! I told my hubby and son that we're leaving, but before we do...I'm making a complaint! Found the manager and asked if they were short staffed because no one came to our table after waiting for so long!!! She asked where we were sitting...told her where but at this point I'm so irritated that I told her we are leaving and that they should read their Yelp reviews because I'm not the only one who thinks their service sucks!!! Never again! How long have they been open? Luckily there's many other restaurants around here!!! Thank you CPK Mililani for ruining our Anniversary! I'm glad this wasn't our actual anniversary dinner!

The only thing that substantiates the one extra star from the minimum would be the bartender who was working that night, who was really pleasant and professional.  After expecting this visit to go like any other CPK visit I've ever had, I ordered the usual (pesto cream penne, add chicken - YUM) and although the restaurant was not packed full, I did expect a wait as there was a decent amount of people in there. As we sat at the bar, my two friends and I received and finished our first round of drinks before bread came out. After ordering and finishing another round, we grew a little concerned. We looked around, and saw everyone who had ordered after us, already enjoying their meals.  We then checked in the the bartender, who said our food would be out any minute. Guess there was a mix up in the kitchen. Eh, it happens. Another round of drinks go by... still nothing. We ask the bartender again if she knows anything about our food. She says she will send someone to check on it again. The woman returns and apologizes, and lets us know our food will be out any minute now... heard that already. About 5 minutes later, we get our food - AND IT'S NOT EVEN HOT. Mind you, it's not ice cold, but it's definitely been sitting out for quite some time. I wouldn't even say it was still warm. At this point, I'm thoroughly annoyed. Then as I'm eating, I notice that there are about a total of 6 small chunks of chicken in my pasta. 6 small bites of chicken for an upcharge of $3 and change? Not right. I've ordered this at Kahala, Ala Moana, Kailua and Pearlridge, and I've never had this little chicken.

On top of that... after waiting over an hour and fifteen minutes for our food to come out... and having the staff be well aware of this and our frustration.... No word from the manager. No discount. No big apology for the bad experience. Just a ""sorry about that"" when the food actually comes out.

109,Halia H.,"Wahiawā, HI",63,8,,1.0,2017-09-24,"I've gone to this place countless times, but the time I went last time was by far one of the worst dining experiences I've had.  The night seemed to go off well, other than the fact we had to wait 50 minutes for our seats at 8 pm at night. When we got seated, we got greeted by our nice waitress. She was sweet and gave us our drinks after we ordered our food right away after waiting the 50 minutes. It ended up taking about 30 minutes just for the food to come out. Not only that, but our bread and spinach artichoke dip appetizer took forever because they had to make more bread. So, after waiting 30 minutes for my mother, my friend, and I's three orders of Shrimp Scampi, Chicken Tequila Pasta, and Mac and Cheese pasta withe extra sauce, we were not satisfied at all. We were already irritated at the fact we had to wait 30 minutes just for our food and constantly getting apologies from our waitress about first the 20 minute wait for our appetizer, and then another 30 minute wait for our food. It was also my mom's birthday dinner, so we weren't so pleased. On top of that, the food was not delish at all... my mom ordered a shrimp scampi (which we get is supposed to be super healthy with all the zucchini and such), but my mom said it was way too sour. She made my friend and I try it ourselves... and both my friend and I did not taste the ""butter"" or ""shrimp"" at all. All we tasted was lemon. It was not enjoyable for my mom. Now, on to my mac and cheese.... I usually order this, and I honestly love it. But, this time, it tasted different. I had ordered extra sauce, and usually the extra sauce comes in a bowl on the side, but this time it did not. It was strange at first. And, even after a minute I got my mac and cheese, another waiter came to deliver the extra sauce in the tiny bowl, only to see that my plate was already drowned in the cheese sauce. The cheese sauce didn't taste like cheese at all. It tasted like milk. It didn't taste like the mac and cheese I always order from CPK. Maybe there was a different cook or something, but the service my mom, my friend, and I got last night was not impressive.  Aside from that, as I mentioned before, it was my mom's birthday... a nice employee who was off shift and sitting on the table behind us ended up buying us a brownie with ice cream. We didn't know he bought it for us, but we at least expected a free ice cream that they usually serve on birthdays (I've even had my birthdays at CPK before)... but we didn't... I had to remind the waitress once more it was my mom's birthday, in which she said ""They didn't give you the brownie and ice cream that the employee behind you bought for you guys?"". We had no clue the nice waiter who was off duty had bought it for us. We could have walked out without it or without any ice cream dessert for my mother's birthday at all.  Thankfully, the manager ended up coming to our table to ask what was wrong, in which we told him... and he ended up paying for the shrimp scampi and remaking our 2 dishes for us. But, honestly, I am very disappointed in CPK Mililani... I was expecting way better like the times I've gone before. CPK is one of my favorite restaurants, but this experience was just horrible. We ended up being late to our 9:50 PM movie because we had to wait for the check and remakes. We got seated at 8:30, and were expecting to have a good birthday dinner and then a quick dessert but it turned out not so good...

They said Laurie would be our server. After about 10 minutes she finally approached our table. We're like okay, maybe she's busy. We ordered our drinks, bowl of soup and entree all at the same time. Warm wine arrived another 10 minutes later and bread maybe another five after that.    Another 15 and our drinks are gone, the bread is gone, our plates are pushed to the edge of the table able and nobody seems to care. Meanwhile Laurie is at a table of old men paying their tab chatting up for 10 minutes. Almost an hour in and nothing. We get up and tell Laurie we are leaving. All of a sudden the manager shows up and says the kitchen lost our ticket. Seriously?  We've been sitting for over 15 minutes trying to catch the attention of anyone that would look our way. Poor poor poor customer service. I hope corporate gets the idea. This obviously is a systemic problem. We will NEVER go back to this location and quite possibly to any of their locations. And I might add this is the 4th time we've experienced bad service in Mililani.

The decor is the typical CPK, and everything is new and clean. You can sit outside (what used to be the sidewalk area), or inside. But depending on the time of day, if you choose to sit outside, you could be in the sun.  So maybe check it out as you're going in as it could affect where you choose to sit. Food can pretty quickly and yup, tasted like how I expected. Consistent CPK fare and presentation. So this place is A-OK, classic CPK presentation and taste, and everything that you would expect.  So yay!

I ordered a kids pepperoni pizza and my husband ordered the Pesto Cream Pasta add chicken. I made it to the pick up counter and the host was extremely courteous and provided excellent service. He verified and updated my CPK rewards account prior to retrieving my food. He packaged everything up and sent me on my way. Upon eating our food less than 10 minutes later we discovered that the pasta was cold and the portion of added chicken was less than adequate. My kids pepperoni pizza was almost orange due to the excessive amount of grease. It was also cold and hard as a rock. It was so hard that I could bang the crust on the table like a drum stick. It was very disappointing. The worst part was that we were starving. It was so bad that my husband couldn't eat all is food which is unheard of. We're not sure if they made our food and let it sit out but it was awful.

319,Gabriel P.,"Honolulu, United States",8,83,131.0,3.0,2017-11-05,Was in the area so we decided to try the new location at the Town Center at Mililani. Got there when the doors opened 11 o'clock. We were the fith in line. Took about 8 minutes then it was our turn. The person didn't say hi or acknowledged us. So I said table for two. He looked at the computer after a couple of minutes he ask us to step in. There was 3 workers standing after another minute one of them looked at us and ask us if we're the party of six. Said no then he looked at the computer and asked if we were the party of two. Said yes. And he picked up the utensils and menus. He than started looking around after another minute or two. A girl came. He gave her the utensils and menus. She then asked me if I wanted to sit in the restaurant or in the lanai. We said inside. She asked us if raised table would be okay. Said yes cause it was getting hot outside. The inside of the restaurant is set up like bar. The seating is high bar stools and a high padded bench. ( I wouldn't recommend this seating option if have trouble stepping up). Our server was cordial and took our order of spinach dip and side order of flat bread and a small salad. Our drinks came out and a couple of minutes later the spinach dip was served. Another five minutes later our salad came. Started to eat our salad and dip. After a few minutes we started to look for our server. The pita bread was to be eaten with the dip. Our server finally came our salad and dip was almost done. I asked her to cancel my order of pita bread. She was very apologetic and said she would go and get it. Told her we were done and to pack our dip to go. A few minutes later a manager came with a new spinach dip with our pita bread. Told him that we asked our server to pack our dip and left over chips to go. He apologized and left. Our server came back with our take out bag and the check. We weren't charged for the spinach. Which was nice.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3?start=120,2.8,2.89,3.076,2.7,2.854

Shrimp scampi zucchini is my normal, and is equally great here as it is at the other locations. We shared a spinach artichoke dip and my daughter had a cheese pizza, both good! My soda & water was always filled, and we were constantly checked on.  Today we had Chanelle who was very pleasant and efficient! Last time we went I think we had a guy named Juliano (sp?) who was also a great server.  Side note, their bar area is really nice!

I ordered a kids pepperoni pizza and my husband ordered the Pesto Cream Pasta add chicken. I made it to the pick up counter and the host was extremely courteous and provided excellent service. He verified and updated my CPK rewards account prior to retrieving my food. He packaged everything up and sent me on my way. Upon eating our food less than 10 minutes later we discovered that the pasta was cold and the portion of added chicken was less than adequate. My kids pepperoni pizza was almost orange due to the excessive amount of grease. It was also cold and hard as a rock. It was so hard that I could bang the crust on the table like a drum stick. It was very disappointing. The worst part was that we were starving. It was so bad that my husband couldn't eat all is food which is unheard of. We're not sure if they made our food and let it sit out but it was awful.

I was already frustrated with waiting. Anyways... they didn't have my order ready until 10pm.

Our second time we went our waitress was very nice, but didn't listen to a word we said. She poured water in my cup of sprite, she said she was coming back with bread but never showed... brought us the wrong appetizer and wrong pizza. Simple questions she'd ask us like ""did u want to hold on to a menu?"" We said yes... but she took them all away.

My pizza was ice cold, I had to wave down a passerby server to ask if it could be warmed up.  Then I had to wave down another to ask for the utensils to eat with,  by this time the warmed up pizza wasn't that hot anymore. Then, I had to wave down another server  for my take out box.  Our Empty plates were never cleared we never received water refills  Then I was charged for the wine I never got! I had to wave down another server to ask for my server.    Low and behold our waitress finally appears and asks if I want the wine now so she can leave the charge on my bill.  I said no thank you I'm done eating my meal now.   I left her 15% tip only because I was raised with manners.

TERRIBLE. Not giving them any more chances.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3,2.48,2.77,3.024,,2.654
203,Jon S.,"Cleveland, United States",2,51,84.0,2.0,2018-07-01,"Food: Typical CPK so 2.5 stars... fairly good pizza but I was disappointed in the piadina. The description is ""a folded pizza-style sandwich"". It was literally a cooked pizza they folded in half. WHAT?! Ugh. They also didn't tell me the side soup or salad was included and it wasn't called out on the menu. Service: Very slow - 1 star. They also forgot one of the starter spinach artichoke dips and one of our groups sandwiches. They comped the sandwich.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3,2.36,2.77,3.028,,2.606
205,Leslie D.,"Cardiff-by-the-Sea, United States",3,3,3.0,1.0,2018-10-01,"Terrible service! Ordered by phone with Monica (person who took my order) at 6:43 pm, call took 4 minutes, I was told to pick up the food in 20 minutes. My boys went to pick up the food around 7:15 pm because I just had surgery and could not go out to get it myself. They were told the order was not put in so they would have to wait longer and ended up waiting till 8:04 pm to get our food! The staff was rude and nothing discounted for the super long wait and their error!!! CPK is lucky I can't go anywhere so couldn't go to pick up the food because if I was there, I would not have put up with this and went elsewhere! To top it all off, all the food was COLD!!! Which means the Pizza and Pasta was sitting a long time before they gave my boys the food!!! RIDICULOUS!!! We will not be going back to CPK again because the SERVICE is TERRIBLE!!!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3,2.32,2.76,3.028,,2.584
199,Kristy N.,"Mililani, United States",104,79,388.0,4.0,2018-11-01,"Choose CPK for a last minute dinner. 4 stars because I really like CPK but today was mediocre. Service was slightly slower than usual and there was hardly any beer available. They 86'd a lot of it. Idk why. The pizza was good. Ordered the basic pizzas; pepporoni and bbq chicken. The lettuce wrap wasn't as good as I thought. I asked about their Halibut and my server said she didn't care for it but I wanted to try it anyway. Definitely should've listened to her!! The best thing on the plate was the asparagus and even the stringy part was still left on! The best part of the meal was the butter cake! And I'm not much of a sweets eater.  Overall, I will be coming back to CPK. Hopefully it makes up for today.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3,2.44,2.79,3.028,,2.6500000000000004
201,Monica S.,"Honolulu, United States",109,114,57.0,2.0,2018-12-01,"I came here for lunch with a colleague on Tuesday to do some work on 1/9/18 from 1-2:30. We were seated at the tables near the bar. The place was not too busy so our server, a thin woman with dark long pretty hair in a pony tail came to see us right away.  Our order was simple two waters,  one glass of wine,  one plain cheese and tomato pizza with a take out box for the other half, and a mushroom pasta.  Our food came out pretty quick with some stake bread and our server never came to see us again! My pizza was ice cold, I had to wave down a passerby server to ask if it could be warmed up.  Then I had to wave down another to ask for the utensils to eat with,  by this time the warmed up pizza wasn't that hot anymore. Then, I had to wave down another server  for my take out box.  Our Empty plates were never cleared we never received water refills  Then I was charged for the wine I never got! I had to wave down another server to ask for my server.    Low and behold our waitress finally appears and asks if I want the wine now so she can leave the charge on my bill.  I said no thank you I'm done eating my meal now.   I left her 15% tip only because I was raised with manners.  If this place were busy I might excuse the horrible  service,  but  I think she had two tables total.  Then I thought,  well maybe she is new? But the service issues I had were common sense.  The food also was not typical CPK.  It tasted like my pizza was microwaved not made to order and it was super greasy! I barely ate it.  I wish we would've  gone elsewhere for lunch.  I won't be coming back.  I don't think the management  at this location is that good.  The service and food here need some serious help.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mililani-3,2.32,2.8,3.02,,2.608
