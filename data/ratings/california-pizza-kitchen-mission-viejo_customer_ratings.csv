Tried to place the order online but it wouldn't let me set the time for pick up for same day.  So, I called back at 9:34 to ask if I could place a phone order and the girl tells me no, I can't place an order because the Pick Up order cut off is 9:30. I tell her it's 9:34 and the person I spoke to earlier should have said something to me if there was a cutoff. I ask her, ""So you're telling me that if I walk in and place an order, you won't wrap it up for me to take home?"" And she tells me no.  My husband went in, because he was already there since I said I was placing an order and at 9:35 they told him they shut the kitchen early due to lack of traffic. Gee, no wonder.

Garlic olive oil pasta is as basic as it gets so not sure how its considered ""secret"" but when we received it, it was tomato based.  Not how we remembered it.

25,Sami B.,"Wilsonville, OR",9,97,4.0,1.0,2013-11-05,"I called in, placed an order on Tuesday night. Asked for BBQ Chicken pizza, Focaccia Chicken Caesar sandwich (which they don't carry anymore, it is on ciabatta now apparently) and 2 side caesar salads. Came inside to pick up and waited behind another takeout customer for about 10-15 minutes even though it wasn't busy- the 3 people working the takeout station were laughing and talking to each other (there was a 2nd open register...), completely ignoring me. When I finally reached the desk, the girl (I don't remember her name, but she had braces) reviewed my order in which she said I ordered a side caesar and a side house salad with caesar. I told her I ordered TWO caesars and she tried to convince me that a house salad is ""practically the same"" as a caesar salad ""except with carrots and stuff"" - sorry, not in my opinion. I asked for TWO, not ONE. Took awhile for her to come back with the order - she placed the sandwich and salads in the bag; I asked for bread and butter AND a side of caesar dressing twice (once on the phone and in person). She pulled out the pizza from under her desk which was odd. Once I got home, the pizza looked OLD, it was cold and tasted like cardboard. BOTH salads were composed of a couple of pieces of lettuce (wilted) that barely covered the bottom of the container, no parmesan, and less than half of a container of dressing for each salads (not to mention, no extra side as I had asked). The ciabatta on the sandwich was broken and crushed, making the whole thing fall apart. Oh, and we only got bread, no butter (as I had asked for twice!) Overall, I feel like the past couple times I have come to CPK (either eating in or taking out), I am paying for a low quality, small portioned, skimped version of a meal for raised prices. I can't believe I paid nearly $40 for this!! And what is with the menu changes? They are worse, not better. Example: focaccia was great! Ciabatta is a poor trade. I definitely don't plan on returning to any of their restaurants which is a shame - my family and I had been coming here for years.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mission-viejo?start=100,2.56,2.56,2.56,2.724,2.56

44,Al S.,"Laguna Niguel, CA",1252,506,242.0,4.0,2013-12-21,"Newsflash....... well, maybe a ""Semi-Old-flash"" from mid 2011, but it explains ""a lot!"" LOS ANGELES -- Private equity firm Golden Gate Capital is buying California Pizza Kitchen Inc. for about $470 million, three months after the restaurant chain put itself up for sale. (skip to this...) Golden Gate's other restaurant buyouts include the purchase of On the Border last year. And last month Lawson Software Inc. agreed to a $2 billion acquisition offer from Golden Gate and Infor. That explains a lot for me. One of my thoughts, and my opinion about CPK, and On the Border, was that they were ""hitting the downward part of their cycle"" as a restaurant chain. We just revisited CKP, MV yesterday, early evening. While the physical layout hasn't changed, they have made ""food changes."" First thing we noticed was a new, tall, thin menu. It's been edited down, but looks like a winner. Their classic fare is still there, (ie; BBQ Chicken Salad). But they do have some new items. (see their website for a menu-listing with nice photos). For a light 6pm dinner we two ordered their ""Two Classic Soups in One Bowl""..... Tortilla and Lentil-Pea. The bowl was large, and the soups were very good. They start you off with a complimentary ""cut sections of warm french baugette"", and a well seasoned olive oil. In the past, bread was served cold. Now, the oil is a great option over butter. My wife had the new Chimmichurri Chicken, grilled chicken breast with a chimmichurri-style sauce, and grilled veggies. My wife felt the vegetables lacked seasoning. I agreed. The chicken was OK, but the overall serving was small, yet the price was $16... which we didn't realize until I paid the bill. That was the only issue we had last night. I ordered my BBQ Chicken Salad, and it was as good as it has always been. ($14). Between the soup, the chicken entree and my salad, we left satisfied. I shared my salad, and my wife gave me some of her chicken and the chimmichurri sauce.  If my wife's entree had not been so overpriced, I might have gone with 4-stars. As our server was attentive. But we'll certainly do future visits, and I'll try a couple of their other new or improved menu items. I know it's a chain...... but this is more an FYI than a ""you gotta' go"" recommendation. I'd say ck' 'em out. I think they're better... maybe not ""better than ever""...... but possibly more pleasing to the palate. (?) BTW....... sent a feedback message via the CPK website with our opinion of their ""chimmichurri chicken entree."" Curious to see if they respond. (?) VERY NICE RESPONSE FROM CPK just one day after using their ""online feedback."" The GM of the CPK MV location actually called me early today while driving to visit family in W.L.A. She noted my comments, and said that the feedback was helpful, as she's going to speak with the supervising chef for their restaurant. This is one of the few times that a retailer's ""online feedback feature"" actually resulted in a callback. Again, I was very, very impressed. I believe she's also sending some gift cert's our way, which wasn't asked for or expected.

We ordered pasta, a Chinese chicken salad and two pasta dishes for the kids.  We were very satisfied with the food which was hot and fresh out of the kitchen.

30,Christina J.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,3,,5.0,2014-07-14,"CPK has never been our first choice in restaurants. In the past, it was always far to busy with overwhelmed, low quality waiters. We decided to get dinner a few nights ago (thursday i believe.) As to be expected, there was a wait. The staff was friendly and even the manager was helping assist people to their tables. We got sat in no time. Or server (Casandra) was extremely attentive and upbeat, despite the crowed restaurant. She made us feel very welcome, which differed from past experiences. Our drinks (white sangria I high recommend) took a bit longer than desired. But it was so tasty that it made up for the wait. This is was only negative thing we had to say. Food wise, anything with BBQ sauce is amazing! A friendly younger manager even stopped by to make sure we were happy.

We had a gift card that my parents-in-law had given us and were using it a second time. $50 goes a long way at a CPK. We placed our orders: 1) A carnitas pizza with habanero sauce on the side 2) A Hawaiian BBQ Chicken pizza. We opted for the traditional crust on both pizza, as neither of us has celiac disease. California Pizza Kitchen's menu had gluten-free options for their crusts for those who have celiac. We ordered these drinks: 1) Ginger Ale 2) Lemonade. The drinks were refilled for free, as per CPK's policy. I also asked for a glass of ice water, which was also refilled upon request. We enjoyed sharing our pizzas. The carnitas pizza is really good - they placed a lot of tender carnitas on the pizza. The habanero sauce went well with the pizza and really spiced it up and added flavor.  The Hawaiian BBQ Chicken Pizza was similar to the regular BBQ Chicken Pizza. The only difference was that it included pineapple, which made for a sweeter, tangier taste. As usual, there were leftovers. A staff member boxed up our pizzas, which had instructions for re-heating printed out on the top of the box. The leftovers tasted great the next day.

CPK pretty much lives and breathes that Cali style we all know and love from the design of the building to the drinks they serve that are infused with those Cali ingredients that just hit the Cali spot to the pizza's pastas and other dishes that keep you warm on those cold Cali nights! I've always been a fan of the California Pizza Kitchen as their pizzas are quite yummy and just bursting with flavor and fresh ingredients which is something you usually don't get out of a chain! The real kicker for their pizza's has to be the wheat crust it is sooo delicious and just all around amazing when you add it to one of their delicious pizza concoctions as I really don't see very many pizza places that offer a wheat crust at all so it makes it a very tasty unique experience! Pretty much the only downfall I've really ever experienced at a CPK is their service it's generally a bit shaky always and I'm not really sure why so if you plan on visiting just be prepared for this. This time around we had their avocado club egg rolls they were super good and just all around scrumptious even more so when I added some of the sauce they gave us to them I'm not exactly sure how to describe the sauces but needless to say they were quite yummy! We had a pepperoni, sausage, & mushroom pizza on the wheat crust of course and after the first warm bite it was like wow this is quite yummy and just hit the spot for the both of us as we were a little bit wet from heading in from the pouring rain! Seriously though one of the funny parts of the night had to be that they were playing The Simpsons on the TV's throughout the CPK I mean come on who doesn't love them!

It's been several years since it changed -- used to be a little sweeter and a little fluffier --  but I still miss it. It was just so good.  I digress - so - this specific location.  It's kind of weird - there are a lot of doors along the side, but there's only one hostess stand. If you enter through the door that is positioned closest to the parking lot, you have to walk through part of the dining room to get to the host stand. In my opinion, it's designed weird. I guess that door is there since it makes it easier for the staff to deliver takeout food to cars? But it's still weird for anyone who is dining in that vicinity.  There can sometimes be a small wait at this location, but I've never experienced anything too severe. There of been times when it's been a bit like a ghost town, but maybe I just eat at peculiar times? Who knows.  I do credit the business a lot - there really added some good things to the menu over the past year or so. I really like the Baja chicken spring rolls.

I was a bit surprised but it's one of the few restaurants in the area open until 10pm. We sat in the bar since it was happy hour. $4 for Corona sounded good. Service was fast and our server was very nice. I ordered the chicken piccatta which was AMAZING. The pasta was my favorite, it was in a delicious lemony sauce with capers YUM. I will definitely get it again. And we also ordered the Kung Pao spaghetti which was a tasty dish. It was like a chow mein that had been mixed with kung pao chicken and drizzled with peanuts.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-mission-viejo,3.0,3.07,3.07,,3.042

It feels warmer and more inviting. It took a little over 5 minutes to be seated , it was not  crowded but they were getting a booth ready for two of us which I appreciated.  Two severs came to our table and welcomed us bask as if they knew us. We told them we had not been here since the remodel. Just one minute later our waiter brought us complimentary chips and avocado to welcome us back, nice touch. My friend and I both ordered the half portion Cobb salad. Our order came pretty quickly and the salads were plenty big for being a half portion.  Over all I like this place, it's just more money than I care to spend on my lunch hour.

114,Megan H.,"Ladera Ranch, CA",19,197,347.0,3.0,2017-08-21,"I've been here multiple times, and I really like the updated menu. I can't eat pizza, so I usually go for the salads. I have tried:  Quinoa Arugula Salad-this is my favorite item on the entire menu. I love arugula and quinoa, and the dressing is delicious. It tastes even better if you add chicken (but that's like $4 extra). Roasted Vegetable Salad- I honestly don't think you need to add any protein to it; it is delicious as it is. Although, they drenched mine in too much dressing. I like the roasted eggplant.  Banh Mi Bowl-this sounded really good and healthy so I had to try it out. It was hard to eat because the carrots were spiralized really big. I also didn't like the bean sprouts. From the menu, I couldn't tell if it was a salad or a bowl kind of deal. It's basically a salad, and there wasn't that much food on the plate.  The prices here are too expensive for the type of restaurant it is. Most salads are $11-$13 but to add protein it's an extra $4-$6! The food is pretty good, but I'll stick to my usual. For appetizers, definitely order the dumplings. They also give you free bread. The last time I was here, the service was great. Our waitress was friendly and the food came out very quick. The time before that, our server brought the appetizers with the actual meal, and took forever to come back and take our order.

That's  an additional 1.50, add avocado to your salad? 2.50 Glass of wine? Would you like the 6oz for the price shown on the menu or the 12oz where we just double the price?
