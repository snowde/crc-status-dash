146,Corey P.,"Woodland, CA",237,367,4.0,4.0,2012-01-10,"Ya know....it's a California Pizza Kitchen. The very epitome of a ubiquitous, soulless chain restaurant. I'm almost embarrassed to eat here, given the quality of fine local restaurants available on and around the Monterey Peninsula. That said...I've never had a bad dining experience at this CPK...their food is invariable fresh, tasty and served by a friendly and speedy server, even on the busiest nights. Figure that has to be worth around four stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-monterey?start=100,3.88,3.88,3.88,3.44,3.88
41,Leah P.,"Gibbon, MN",5,80,5.0,3.0,2012-03-19,"Maybe my taste buds are changing. I used to really like CPK but now it's really only Meh. I think ever since they took the fresh summer rolls off the appetizer menu I haven't been as excited to return. I went back yesterday only because my beau had never been to a CPK and I wasn't in the mood to cook at home and we were already at Whole Foods at the mall.  The pea and barley soup lacked flavor, I don't think it was spiced with anything more than salt and pepper.. and i added more pepper to it.  The focaccia was soft and warm and cheap so that got my approval even though I typically try to shy away from breads.  The veggie pizza with eggplant left me wanting something with some extra flavor so I added chili flakes.. which did very little.  All in all I doubt I will be returning to a CPK any time soon. I remember the salads being decent but I didn't opt for one this time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-monterey?start=120,3.92,3.92,3.92,3.372,3.92
136,Paul B.,"Dallas, TX",177,241,2.0,5.0,2012-03-29,"I haven't been to this particular CPK since I left Monterey in 2007, so take this with a grain of salt. I, too, have some prejudice against this place for being a chain, but when I really think about it, I never had a bad dining experience here. The food options are great, and it was always really delicious. I tried a lot of different pizzas from their menu, as well as some of the pasta entrees. The bread with oil and vinegar was pretty delicious all by itself.  I went there a lot. Towards the end of my time in Monterey I got one of the Thai pasta dishes most of the time. It was tasty and spicy, just how I like it. Having found nothing wrong with this place other than the fact that it's a chain, I have given it five stars. If you've never tried it, you should.

145,Cathy K.,"Seaside, CA",94,162,98.0,4.0,2012-04-15,"I know I know....I don't like to give chain restaurants more than 3 stars, but this place is so consistent that I truly am a fan and so is my husband.  We normally order the garlic chicken pizza on thin crust, since it is so lean and tasty.  CPK is one of those places we only go to during the week because we like to keep our regular dinners pretty healthy and light and then splurge on the weekend.  We can have a nice dinner that is low in calories here.  We share one of those white corn guacamole small appetizers too, and it is always fresh and tasty.  The service is also consistent and we normally sit at the bar if it is crowded.  Our favorite server is Aleks and he is an equally good bartender.  He makes a great gin martini and cosmo, so hit him up for something.  They also have a decent wine list so no complaints there either.   Like another reviewer said, you are not coming here for NY Style or Chicago pizza.  So don't intend to get something like that if you are.  This is also no Pizza Bianco in Phoenix, so don't expect that either, but all the food is good and the drinks are cold.  The service is also consistent and they normally seat people really quickly, even when there is a line.   I have seen this place jam packed and everyone is running around like crazy, but the staff works together and they always seem to have a good attitude, even when they are in the weeds.  I appreciate that because nobody wants to eat dinner in a place where the staff is arguing and acting unprofessional - as entertaining as that can be.   The atmosphere is clean and fresh and it is your standard upscale casual dining experience.  If you are coming to Monterey for the first time and not adventurous enough to eat at a local place (which you will regret), then you won't be disappointed with CPK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-monterey?start=100,3.92,3.92,3.92,3.44,3.92

I've never had to wait for a table, even coming on a Friday or Saturday night. In fact, it's usually so deserted that I get to choose between a booth or a table. You have to ask for bread and water if you'd like it, as they usually don't offer. Their seasonal strawberry shortcake is awesome! If you have the mall's shopping discount card (available at the info booth by Macy's) they'll give you a free item off their small cravings menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-monterey?start=140,3.84,3.84,3.84,3.44,3.84
54,Shiho F.,"Carmel by the Sea, CA",4970,2834,2440.0,3.0,2012-05-17,"Overall a decent dinner and wonderful service.  I got my usual Waldorf Salad but unfortunately it came with some browned Granny Smith Apples that were far from crisp and turned into apple sauce when I bit into them, mealy if you will.  Doused in their lovely ranch, I almost didn't notice.  The Cobb was fine and my friend devoured her plate of Avocado Club Eggrolls and again service couldn't have been better. My only issue is their Gluten Free menu... so happy that they've adopted one but they need to follow through.  According to their website they are working with the Gluten Intolerance Group or GIG.  I think they need to do a refresher course as my Sedona Soup sans the tortilla chip toppings definately had wheat in it.  My allergy is so severe that I get crazy sysmptoms within seconds.  I've never had a problem with any of their salads or dressing (thank the food gods) but one sip of this soup and I immediately got congested, my stomach started to bloat and within a minute I looked like I had gone from maybe prego to 8 months... if you think I'm kidding come what me lick flour off your counter.  Bowling ball in my gut, inflamations all around (lower back and neck pain) and here's the kicker, I get open sore welts... well maybe not that bad, but huge pimples that not only hurt but pretty much blow up.  Gross.  I'm sorry but it's true.   I know people think I'm crazy and that I shouldn't eat out.  I probably shouldn't but that's like telling Valentino Rossi to stop racing or telling Nicki Minaj to stop with the pop-y tunes (not to mention somehow catchy) and ridiculous costumes.  It's not going to happen as it's probably one of my favorite things to do.   If there is no wheat in the soup (perhaps MSG?) then I'm sorry but they will need to take extra care to not cross contaminate the food.  For ex. If someone places a gluten topping on the soup and fishes it out... it still contains gluten, or if they keep the soups near the flour used to make pizza... not the best idea.  I'm just throwing it out there and surprisingly and comforting to me... the more I talk about it, the more I hear that I'm not the only one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-monterey?start=120,3.8,3.8,3.8,3.308,3.8
40,James C.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,25,,3.0,2012-06-14,I've been to many CPK locations but the food at this location is just below par.   Ordered a cobb salad along with pasta and a pizza.  Pasta was too peppery and the pizza tasted like microwaved frozen pizza...  Not a place you would go for a great food.

108,Jenna M.,"Salinas, CA",3,15,4.0,5.0,2012-08-17,"It had been several years since I've eaten here.  I don't think it was for any particular reason that I stopped going, perhaps it just seemed overpriced.  However, I decided to give it another shot and I am very glad that I did!  There is a reason that this place is always bustling!  And the pizzas we ordered were well worth their price! The wait time was reasonable and I appreciated the seating layout. We were given a booth that is raised about a foot off the ground. This is a great design because even though the restaurant was very full, I could see over the other tables and therefore did not feel crowded in. Our server Jose was very friendly and helpful when we mentioned that we were more or less newbies.  He proclaimed that CPK's motto was ""Be Adventurous"", so we could feel free to try something new and exotic. And if we absolutely hated it, they'd make us something else.  Well no worries there because our 2 pizzas were absolutely delicious! We got their signature pizza with BBQ Chicken and Apple-wood Bacon, as well as a Pear & Gorgonzola pizza, as well as their fried mac&cheese appetizer -which was sinfully great!  3 extremely different taste options, but they were all excellent! Be warned, this is not your average pizza place. Don't come here if all you want is pepperoni and cheese on thick, chewy bread. But do come here if you want to try delicious gourmet concoctions that just happen to lay on a thin pizza crust.  Granted, the unique factor can be somewhat startling at first. I was very surprised when my pizza arrived covered in what appeared to be a salad.  Don't get me wrong, it tasted great, but I was not keen on eating a salad-covered-pizza with a knife and fork. So I pushed my greens off to the side and dug into the pizza.  That first bite reminds you that this is not your average pizza.  Once you let your brain register that, you can simply enjoy the delicious flavors. I see a lot of lower star ratings here, but I myself had a wonderful experience and will definitely be back to sample more of their menu!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-monterey?start=80,3.88,3.88,3.88,3.4440000000000004,3.88

Since I did not order pizza I can not say its a great pizza place, but their salads are yummy!  They have one of the best Chicken Cesar salads I have ever had, I only ordered a half portion since I was told the full size is really big. Since I wasn't able to finish the half portion before I was full I would have to agree.  I will  be going back to CPK and I am hoping to try the pizza next time.

My wife had the 'choped salad' and declared it wonderful. (she has had it before so that's not fair). I had the Italian deli sandwich. I think I've had it before also. It's the only sandwich on the menu I would order. I have had the Sicilian Pizza a few times in the past. Pretty good. Better than the ones you can buy at Safeway and cook at home. Try it at the restaurant, it's good.  So it's not just a pizza joint but a place with lots of salads which the women love and other stuff for us guys. It's not Iolis (Carmel Valley) but ok for a chain place.  The service was excellent and the food came about as I would expect it, slow. Good if you are in the area and hungry. I was.

171,Peta B.,"Salinas, CA",2,151,14.0,4.0,2012-10-13,"Very good overall; the food is creative, tastes fresh and natural and decor is nice  (this one is very clean, well managed and newer - around 2005; you can see the chef and manager do their rounds quite frequently); TVs are a tad prominent.  We pretty much always have the Tuscan Hummus for an appetizer and it never fails to please. Flavors are balanced and strong but not overpowering. I definitely recommend adding Parmesan to the pastas, it rounds out the flavors nicely. For deserts, I do recommend the seasonal choices; right now that would be a Pumpkin Cheesecake slice on ginger-praline base with whipped creme that is, I kid you not, perhaps the best slice of cheesecake I've had.  Two opportunities for improvement: warm bread and more easily spreadable butter (sometimes almost cold). Overall, this one of our regular restaurants, my husband having always been a CPK fan.

I never have to check my order and there's always extra bread and chili flakes even when I don't ask for it anymore. They just know me and I really really appreciate that.  I never order pizza here but I love the tomato basil spaghettini with goat cheese and grilled chicken. I'm not suppose to eat wheat or I break out in a rash but oh my gosh is it worth it! Something about those tiny little noodle strands mixed together with plum tomatoes and goat cheese with a hint of rosemary from the chicken makes me do a happy dance in my seat.  I usually get the same takeout person which is probably why he gives me the equivalent of two loaves of bread at any of time of day and promptly dumps a handful of chili pepper flakes.

57,Dante J.,"Carmel, CA",0,12,1.0,2.0,2013-11-30,"I don't really see CPK as a place to dine-out but I do enjoy their food for takeout -- their salads are fresh and unique and several of the pizzas are quite good.  That said, it is extremely frustrating that a business (a company interested in actually making profits) does not accept takeout orders at 9:15pm. Really?? They close at 10pm yet they don't have time to make a thin crust pizza and salad in the 45 minutes remaining until closing time. What's even more annoying is the fact if you were to dine-in they would seat you at 9:15.  Annoyed at this asinine policy, I called CPK back and asked to speak to the manager. The 12 year-old girl who answered the phone could barely even handle picking up the phone and saying ""hello"" let alone actually connect me to the manager. She hung up after telling me to hold on. Not particularly satisfied with this level of service, I called back again.

One thing that my group and I liked was combining both the herb dressing and the bbq sauce to eat with the salad. It sounds a little weird,  but it tasted very good! We ordered 3 pizzas. 1 of them was called California Veggie which had corn,  mushrooms, eggplant, red onions,  sundried tomatoes,  and broccolini. This pizza lacked flavor for me. The second pizza we got was called The Works which had pepperoni, spicy sausage,  mushroom, and green bell peppers. This pizza looked exactly like the combo Costco pizza and tasted exactly the same as well except with a slightly thinner crust. The third pizza we got was the Wild Mushroom which had multiple varieties of mushrooms and green onions. This pizza was my favorite because it was really flavorful and I love anything with mushrooms.

I didnt get his name but he was a taller, black guy and if management reads these, GIVE HIM A RAISE! Very friendly and made us feel very welcomed. Our server was also great. The reason I am writing this review though is because of our pizza. I have never been a judge of pizza because to me, all pizza is good haha. Ive had about 40+ pizza's from this place and the meat craver's pizza WAS THE BEST! All sorts of meats on this pizza but the magic behind the pizza last night was the CRUST! Oh my goodness. Just a very light tinge to the outside of the crust and the inside was melt in your mouth deliciousness! 2 THUMBS UP to the chef that was there last night. I was so impressed that I even made a comment to the gentleman that helped us earlier.

I was treated wrongly here after undergoing training and the management could absolutely care less about me leaving. Never apologized or explained their motives for removing my shifts constantly, and never giving me a chance to work. It was the worst experience I've ever had and I was very disappointed because I had high hopes that the staff would somehow make their new team members feel as a part of their team but they do not. Even though the entire training emphasized this, which is so ironic. Not only that but I was mistreated by a coworker at the time who was supposed to be training me for my new position. Instead I was ignored the entire night until I asked for constructive criticism at the end of the shift, but instead she went on to criticize my appearance. This place is extremely unprofessional in the way they handle new employees. Oh and also, the food is horrendously overpriced. Not from a biased opinion, but from a former customer who had eaten here plenty of times before being hired. Make your own pizzas at home with 2x the toppings for half the price.

We took my daughter out for getting all As this quarter and she chose CPK after our movie.  I was hesitant and it took me a while because I don't require a lot of these toppings on my pizza.  Well to start, we had Gabe the server and he was spot on with his recommendations and suggestions.  I always like to ask the servers what they would eat or do eat from the restaurants they are serving us in.  They do not have traditional buffalo wings as an app and we asked about the buffalo cauliflower he said it taste just like chicken.  We all laughed and said yeah right Gabe, but we ordered it anyway.  It was amazing and Gabe was right! They do something to give it a crunch on the outside like fried and sauced wings.  My daughter has been asking me to try to make at home prior and this app has encouraged me to try because I kept telling her no I'll just make the wings.   I am very particular about my beverage and the bar did not disappoint-a Long Island Ice Tea shaken and poured no ice in my drink-it was refreshing and I only needed one!!! As for the pizza I tried the Margherita, my daughter did the BBQ chicken with bits of bacon, and my husband got a chipotle one w/beans, corn, and some other stuff on it.  When the pizza came out the table was silent due to all the eating that was occurring.   Happy I tried it it is a good dining option now that pizza parlors aren't readily accessible.  Thanks Gabe and CPK we will be back!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-monterey,3.8,3.73,3.73,3.184,3.758
