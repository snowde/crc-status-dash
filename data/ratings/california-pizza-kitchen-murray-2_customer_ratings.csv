61,Jason F.,"Holladay, UT",46,235,119.0,4.0,2012-01-12,"This CPK is kind of a petite version of normal CPKs. It is quite small compared to all the other CPKs I have visited.  When this location first opened it was a bit shaky in terms of service. I think they have finally resolved those issues. Also the menu seems to have improved, and I like the new options. CPK has moved from a trendy kind of establishment into more of a mainstream chain. The food is still quality and i like the pizzas quite a bit.  parking can be a bit of an issue as this location in attached to one of the most popular malls in SLC. The constructions seems to mostly have subsided for now. This location is also right next to a Cheesecake factory which can grow very crowded, so you can use this place as a fall-back location if you don;t want to wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-murray-2?start=60,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000007

Not normally a frequent visitor to large chains, I was very pleasantly surprised. Super service, a busy visible manager not only checked in on us several times but was serving drinks,chasing servers, watching the chefs and generally covering a lot of ground. Pay increase warranted! Kids had a pizza, (surprise), wifee took a half Cob Salad which was large enough to feed an entire homeless shelter.

68,Alesia B.,"Murray, UT",8,4,,1.0,2012-08-01,"I stopped by this CPK on 07/31/2012. I've actually never eaten at a CPK before, and was really looking forward to trying it out. I have lots of friends who have eaten here and love it. So I figured why not. When we got there it was packed, which as to be expect being as this is a very popular restaurant, so I asked to be seated outside where it would be quiet. The host sat us down, and said he would need to find a waiter, but they would be out within a moment.  So we looked over our menus, and after waiting outside for 20 minutes we finally decided what we wanted. Still a waiter had not come by to take our drink orders either. I noticed an employee walk by as I tried to flag him down. Shouting actually quite loudly, he ignored me. We decided to wait about 10 more minutes before stacking up our menus and just leaving through the fenced area. So I can't even say that the food was good. haha. I can say service was definitely horrible, and I probably won't go there again. Even after calling the manager of the store he said he would make sure we were seated right away if we came back, and meal would be on him. Eh, I take that offensively like he thinks we can't afford to eat there...

13,Jean W.,"Riverton, UT",225,365,428.0,3.0,2012-09-19,"Chain chain chain...chaaaiaiaiaian...chain of foo-ood... Should we hold this against California Pizza Kitchen? Yeah, we probably should. And here's why: there's just no love in the food, and it shows. I personally believe there's plenty of love in the recipes they've developed. The incorporated creativity is impressive (Pear-Gorgonzola pizza, people!). But when you franchise these recipes within a network of hundreds of shops, employ a series of preparers (sorry, I just can't call them chefs nor cooks) called things like 'Spyk,' and price these items equivalent to an ounce of gold, it fails to impress. Especially once the bill arrives. CPK, as it's come to be known, serves good and somewhat creative thin-crust pizza, salads, small plates, Italian-esque favorites, a few forgettable desserts, and decent adult beverages, including a surprisingly comprehensive wine list.  Gluten-free, vegan and vegetarian choices, and allergan information for those with food allergies are available. The menu is filled with beautiful and colorful photos of what the food is supposed to look like (I call this ""Getting Wendy-d."")  Sometimes it even comes close. Here are my go-to CPK menu items when I end up here: - Pear-Gorgonzola Pizza (nice mix of flavors) - Tortilla Spring Rolls (Mexi-twist on the traditional - yummy) - Roasted Veggie Salad (the only thing missing is BEETS!) - California Club Sandwich (good bacon and fresh avocado, with chicken/turkey) - Flavored lemonades, and Prosecco! Other entrees I've tried, including most pizzas, have not really lived up to my expectations from even a chain such as this. You're better off getting the 2-fer deal on their frozen pizza from your favorite grocer. I strongly suspect that CPK is in the same family of corporate conglomerates as The Cheesecake Factory. Specific specialties but seemingly hundreds of other choices diluting the menu, overpriced for general quality, oversized portions, largely unhealthy options -  the similarities are uncanny. One final menu note--skip dessert here. In fact, if you're craving something sweet and have any room left after CPK, head over to Brio and order the Mascarpone Cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-murray-2?start=40,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003
6,Andrew S.,"Riverton, UT",160,382,102.0,4.0,2012-11-09,"I've visited CPK a few times.  Honestly, none of them have ever been by my choice, more for occasions.  To me it's always just been ""oh the pizza chain with the weird flavors"".  Well in many respects that does sum it up quite well. This particular occasion was a Birthday for a family member and the result was a decent sized party, and so a few different pizzas to sample.  And honestly, I think that helped!  Usually when I come here it's novel for the first couple slices but then sort of...well...you know.  You wish there was a different flavor to sample. Well in this with a little slice trading, I sampled three different ones. Chicken Chipotle - Definitely my favorite pizza here. 4/5. Habenero Carnitas - Spicy!  And those who read my reviews (and you both know who you are) know I like things hot & spicy.  This did not disappoint.  4/5. Artichoke and Spinach - 2/5.  One point for artichoke, another for spinach.  Not much else to write home about! I generally am not a big dessert eater.  Not because I don't enjoy such things, more because if I eat such things too often I really WILL become a BIG dessert eater.  Well now I've got myself stuck in yet another time paradox (thank you Universe) I can say that I did enjoy sampling the pumpkin cheesecake.  Very yummy!  I'll give that 5/5.  I should give it 8/5 - because it's yummy, but also a seasonal item, the upshot being there's not too many opportunities I could be tempted by it.  However, we'll stick with 5 because if there is one thing that messes up my enjoyment of any dessert item, it's improper fractions. Service was pretty good overall and prompt.  Drink refills were so fast I could barely keep up!  Now keep in mind this visit was on a Sunday, it definitely helps.  I've never had bad service here, but it can be slow when the place is busy. 3/5.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-murray-2?start=40,2.9920000000000004,2.9920000000000004,2.9920000000000004,2.9920000000000004,2.992000000000001

I will say the only times I've ever come to this chain is when I'm dining with friends who have children who don't want to go the more typical route of family friendly restaurants such as Chili's or Applebees. The environment here is slightly more conducive to relaxation. The lights are dim, there's lots of light salads and pasta plates on the menu and of course pizza. But they have a children's menu that offers dollar desserts and games that can be drawn on with crayons that the restaurant provides. If you're some type of elitist pizza foodie I would not recommend here as the pizza isn't your traditional fare.

All the food was good - not bad, not great.  It's a chain and it's pretty consistent with its food quality.

Now days, I can find versions of  most of CPK's specialty pizzas at local places that I enjoy even more than CPK. I think it's a good place to take the kids though. They seem to like it.

29,Britt H.,"Salt Lake City, UT",22,32,26.0,3.0,2015-02-21,"My three stars are an average of four stars for the food and two stars (generous!) for the management!   My family and I eat here every once in awhile, and we use their curbside to-go service sometimes, too.  Let me start with the not-so good.  The curb-side experience has ranged from fine (a few minute wait beyond what CPK promises before the food arrives to the car) to poor (the food not coming out to the car for 25 minutes and making a trip into the restaurant with my two toddlers and baby necessary).  So it's hit and miss.  I can tell you that the only reason we come back is because the food is pretty good and not at all because this restaurant is well-run.  Because it's not!  Unfortunately, you probably shouldn't come here if your hunger is above a 4 on the 10-point scale.  Because it doesn't matter when you arrive, you will not get your food in a timely manner.  There can be three full tables or twenty-three full tables and either way, there will be a substantial delay somewhere in your experience.  Today we were seated promptly, but it took almost 25 minutes before our order was taken.  Our drinks were brought out quickly, but after that, the crap hit the fan.  And I want to stress that this was not our waitress' fault at all--she was awesome!  She just had wayyyy too many tables to handle.  Which, I think, is the problem.  It feels like this CPK is chronically understaffed. Like I said, the food is really good!  We love the hummus and pita appetizer!  Standouts, to me, are the Tortilla Soup, BBQ Chicken Salad, Thai Crunch Salad, Waldorf Chicken Salad, Tostada Pizza with chicken, and the Grilled Chicken with Chimichurri.  All these dishes are flavorful and fresh!  The salads are substantial and filling, and the tostada pizza is different and delicious.  I have been loving the chimichurri, too.  It's spicy, but there's a lot of flavor behind that spice.  Very good. We always finish our meal with a piece (it's more like a mini-cake) of the Butter Cake.  It is gooood.   There's a cheesecake-y top on it and the cake itself is a moist yellow cake with sugar on the bottom.  Get it warm and ala mode and you'll be happy!  Unfortunately, you might have to wait like two hours after you walk in to get your dessert.  So again, come here when your hunger is not urgent.  Or it's bad mood city and even the good food can't pull you out of it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-murray-2?start=20,3.04,3.04,3.04,2.8600000000000003,3.0400000000000005

They fixed the mistake but the pizza was really bland and soggy in the middle. They offered to replace the pizza with something else and I declined.

They sell California Pizza Kitchen brand oven pizzas, and despite being frozen pizzas, they're to die for. I figured I should give the actual restaurant a try and it didn't disappoint. They asked us if we had ever eaten at one of their restaurants before and we said no. Usually they just say something like ""Oh you haven't? Well, welcome!"" or something like that. This place went above and beyond. The server got down on his knees at our table, and recommended quite a few different things. As we debated what we wanted, he said he had a surprise for us. I was really confused, but we continued to debate what kind of pizza we wanted. He came by with a free cheese bread style appetizer which cost 6-7 bucks, and said it was on the house, since it was our first time. That was pretty amazing in and of itself, but not only that, he gave us a free appetizer coupon for next time too.  The food was amazing, we ended up not being able to agree on a pizza, so we got half of what I wanted, and half of what she wanted (for a little extra $ I believe). It was overall a great experience food-wise, and service-wise.  I will definitely be going back. One, to get my free appetizer!

But after being given a CPK gift card (and accidentally waiting 6 months to use it) we figured it was time to give it a shot.  Here's the thing I'm realizing, chain restaurants become so wide-reaching because at some point, somewhere, there was ONE spot that was so good, there was a reason to expand-- people flocked to it! So at the heart of chain store, there MUST be some goodness, right?  This was the case with CPK. It was good, it really was. We ordered the Avocado Egg Rolls (6 halves and comes with two dipping sauces), the Pepperoni, Mushroom, Sausage Pizza, and the Chipotle Chicken Pizza. They also bring a ranch dipping sauce with the pizzas (bonus!).  By far, our favorite was the Pepperoni, Mushroom, Sausage! The meat was good, it had a little kick. The Chipotle pizza was fine, we enjoyed it, but I'm not in a hurry to reorder it. The crust is thin, so you don't feel overly heavy after eating. The appetizer was decent! It was a cliche dish that usually all (similar) chains carry. We finished it, though-- it was decent!  I'm not running back to CPK anytime soon, I still like places that are more local.

Usually I'll have the roasted veggie salad which is full of romaine lettuce, roasted eggplant, corn, sun dried tomatoes, yellow peppers, artichokes, avocado and topped with a yummy Dijon balsamic vinagarette. As usual the salad was great.  The pizza on the other hand was good and not so good.  Had the Jamaican jerk chicken pizza which was so tasty with just the right amount of kick to it.  One of our favorites the Thai chicken was not quite what we were used to. My main problem with it was it's supposed to be a Thai chicken pizza but we had a real problem finding much chicken. Other than the lack of chicken, it was okay.  Service wasn't the best today either.  Drinks weren't refilled very often and our server seemed to disappear at times.  I'm sure we'll be back for the salad but not so sure about that Thai pizza anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-murray-2,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005

I've had chicken piccata just about anywhere a restaurant  Offers it and I have to admit, this place never disappoints. It's always consistently, good, they never deviate from their original flavor. I like their BBQ chicken pizza, too, minus the onions.  Yum!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-murray-2,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005

In a horrible attempt to reinvent itself, CPK has gutted most of its beloved food items and has replaced the menu with fru fru food such as gourmet chicken dishes and protein dishes.  Gone are most of the pizzas we love....isn't the name of it the California PIZZA Kitchen? I guess we should have figured it was dead when we chose to go on a Friday night at 7:00pm wth a party of 6 and we were seated right away.   I wish there was a way to raise this former beautiful being from the dead, but alas, the idiot suits who tend the look at an excel spreadsheet will not listen.  Like the dodo bird, the former restaurant known as the CPK is now dead and extinct.  A truly sad day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-murray-2,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004
53,Luis M.,"Salt Lake City, UT",17,2,7.0,5.0,2017-07-09,I was extremely impressed with all the team who did take care of us today. My partner did have a low sugar attack so we didn't bother to wait to be seated and went straight to the counter ... immediately our server came and she took care of him after we told her. She came with an orange juice glass for him. Offered us some delicious fresh bread and took our order. Since we were at the counter we did watch what great job Ryan do together with his whole team. The pizza was superb!!! But the service was not only superb but amazing! Kudos to our server ...she did excellent job and kudos to Ryan who run this place like a true professional!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-murray-2,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005

I've always enjoyed the Waldorf salad and the pizzas at CPK. This time I was thoroughly disappointed. The utensils were not included (after I had specifically asked the driver if it was - this will be the last time I include a tip when I order and will do it post delivery). The salad was fresh but the dressing and overall flavor was very sour. The Margherita pizza was very dry, the tomatoes and the cheese appeared to have been nuked in the microwave. Totally flavorless and thoroughly disappointed.  How many times can I say disappointed in review???

I used to like the Jambalaya, but for the last 2 times, it was bland, no crawfish and lacking of sauce. The ribeye steak was complete well-done. I asked for some hot sauce and they only have siracha.
