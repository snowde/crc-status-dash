It's been a little difficult working our way around the menu, because when I find something I love, I want to stop there, but I soldier on, and we make efforts to try one new thing a trip. What I love: the pizzas (!), the pesto cream pasta, the desserts, their new little bites apps ( specially the Quesadilla one). I get a little confused because the quesadilla clearly has nothing to do with my pesto main dish, but  I am not a fine diner, and this is not a classic Italian place. Two misses for us were the Guac appetizer ( tasteless), and the bread you can have brought to your table upon request ( cold bread, rock-hard butter, just like any cafeteria experience.) Our service has always been great. Last visit we had an issue with our apps which needed to be addressed by management and it was all handled graciously and way beyond our satisfaction. Also I tend to be one of THOSE people who tweak things to get to my perfect dish,( I prefer fett vs. penne, add sundrieds, etc) and they accommodate me w/out blinking an eye. The only thing that keeps us from stopping by much more often is they close around 9pm ( yay. Naples.) Which means if you get there by 8, you'll be one of the last tables.

13,Arlene H.,"Naples, FL",324,130,336.0,5.0,2014-10-20,"I rarely hand out 5 stars to just any major chain restaurant, but I am a strong believer in the changes that CPK has made for the better. First off, I'm in love with the renovations and floor plan.  Prior to the reno, some areas did not make sense with workflow.  Now, the table set-up makes a lot more sense, and it feels like they added more seating.  The wood slat designs on the wall, chairs and tables, matched by the metal frames make it casual, but casually spectacular.  Clean lines and it feels clean too.  They also have a beautiful bar area that opens up to the outside patio.  The indoor and outdoor space are congruous with each other.  The bar top is this huge slab of white quartz?  I think they did a phenomenal job in keeping with the elegance of Waterside Shops, but with purpose in keeping it casual.  Maybe the demographic might shift this season and call for people who would like to stay past 9pm. And then there's the FABULOUS menu.  I have tried their new flatbreads: the bianco - their white cheese pizza, their mushroom and spinach, spicy sausage and poblano pepper, and their ham and swiss.  Don't worry.  Not all at the same time.  They all are worth trying. CPK also has a seasonal menu.  This go-round, they have a bacon, potato, leek and sunny-side up egg pizza.  WHAT? Breakfast comfort at its finest.  A fried egg doesn't just go on a burger to be ""cool"". There a ton of salads to choose from, but I tried their quinoa and arugula salad.  It had sundried tomatoes, pine nuts, asparagus, feta, onions, and it was lightly dressed, or not even dressed at all....this was a good thing.  It paired nicely with my ham and swiss flatbread. Tip on salads:  Half salads are plenty enough for one meal, or get a whole to split.  I still ordered a half salad and ended up taking some home with me.  (However, the leftovers got gobbled up within 5 minutes of entry into the fridge.) If there's enough room, you must try their pumpkin cheesecake!

Since CPK doesn't take reservations, we called them 15-20minutes ahead of our arrival time to have our name on the list for a table of 6 people. Once we arrived, we waited about 10-15 minutes for a 6 person table to open up, which wasn't too bad since it's Mother's Day.  Throughout our time at CPK, there were a few bumps in the road. The difference in this restaurant is the way the manager and our server handled each problem that arose in a calm and professional manor. The manager Rich and our server Jose were very accommodating, diligent, and friendly. We will definitely be back for another visit.  The different plates we ordered were delicious and had great presentation. For an appetizer, we ordered the spinach artichoke dip and it was tasty, like always. The original steak entree my brother ordered was much much too rare and his potatoes were ice cold. They took back his meal and brought out a fresh one, perfectly cooked and warm. The other meals were great, I would definitely recommend the BBQ chicken pizza with pineapple or if you like a little spice - the Thai chicken pizza.  They added some new healthy power bowls to the menu. We got the Banh Mi Bowl and it was delicious, but the portion size of each item in the bowl was pretty small. Great for people eating healthy and watching their portion size. The dressing also had a kick to it, so be prepared!  For dessert we had the key lime pie and Belgian chocolate soufflé cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. They were both delicious, but if I had to pick one, the chocolate soufflé is the winner.  Overall, the experience was great and made for a wonderful Mother's Day lunch!
