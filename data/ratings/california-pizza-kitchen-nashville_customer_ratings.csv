123,Ally E.,"Killeen, United States",7,26,13.0,1.0,2012-09-16,"My disgusting experience that I had with some friends at CPK in Nashville (Hillsboro Pike) on Saturday, September 15, 2012.   I guess we didn't see the red flags, but it started from the time we walked in the door. We waited 7 minutes to be seated. I know this exact time, because I received a phone call as we walked in, so I excused myself and came in after that. That call was 7 minutes and 42 seconds. My party was still standing at the hosteess station. The restaurant was not half full. It appeared to be a slow night. There was no hostess or greeter on hand. We were asked had we been helped, and were finally seated by our server. I went directly to the restroom. Upon returning to the table within a few moments, drinks were being brought to the table. I immediately asked, ""Don't you all wait until all parties are at the table before taking orders. "" Our server, simply stated sorry. I ordered a strawberry lemonade as did the rest of my party. I was then informed, ""It may take a while, since we just ran out of lemonade"" so I ordered a sweet tea and water. We all placed our orders and waited patiently. We sat chatting amongst ourselves and drinking our drinks. Our server came and brought refills of water, to 2 of the 4 glasses at the table, while our lemonades and sweet teas were not refilled. Our food came, still no refills. At this point, I'm thinking did they run out of sweet tea as well? Finally I asked can I have a refill to either my water or sweet tea. Both of my glasses had ice only at this time. So I was given a refill of water. WOW!! Finally after waiting long enough I asked another server to ask my server for a sweet tea refill. Our food came, and I immediately asked for extra parmesan and croutons. A male server brought me croutons and dressing. The most upsetting part was the MOUSE that ran across the floor. At this point we asked for checks and were ready to go. While we sat there, my husband drank a sip of his water, and said it's time to go now in an upset voice. I asked him what's wrong, and he showed us a dead fly floating in his water!!  As we walked out a CPK employee said thanks for coming, hope you enjoyed dinner and the show in a joking voice. This was a very upsetting experience. I don't see anything funny about it. Seeing a 4 legged critter race across the room while you are eating and the dead fly in a drink, plus the lack of service makes me never want to step foot in this restaurant again. Whether $5 or the $46.43 that we spent, I am a paying customer and expect better.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-nashville?start=40,3.8,3.8,3.8,2.5640000000000005,3.8

20,Megan W.,"Nashville, TN",10,87,69.0,5.0,2013-01-24,"I'll be really upfront with you in my review of this place. I loved the atmosphere, the hostess was nice, our waiter was on par with service, and the food was good--not the best pizza I've ever had, but it was good. To try and be a bit adventurous, I got one of their appetizers, something with pork dumplings and ginger chili sauce (or something along those lines...) and that was actually very tasty. I ordered their BBQ chicken pizza and asked the waiter to leave off the cheese (all my lactose free buddies say 'holla!!'). After ordering, the manager (I'm assuming) came over before the food came out to ask me about my order; she said I'd requested no cheese and wanted to make sure I meant no cheese at all, not just the mozzerella on top. I said yes, I'm lactose-free, so she informed me that our waiter hadn't asked for the gouda to be taken off and that they were making me another pizza right at that moment, but they'd go ahead and bring the other one out since they'd already made it and they'd take that pizza off of the ticket (I think...)

This place is convenient to our office so we do lunch here quite a bit.  We sometimes start with the Avocado Eggrolls which are SO good.  There are 6 of them so it's best to split between 3 people - one is not enough and more than 2 is too much.  Their salads are good.  I usually get the Thai Crunch salad with avocado.  Half salads are good portions, especially if you've already had an appetizer.  Their seasonal menu is usually yummy.  During this summer they have a California Fields salad with strawberries and watermelon that is refreshing.  CPK has a small plates menu with a few good choices.  If I order from that menu, I get the Asparagus and Arugula Salad paired with Shaved Mushroom and Spinach Flatbread.
