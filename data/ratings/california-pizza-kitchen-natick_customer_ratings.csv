45,Sneakers A.,"Framingham, MA",0,25,,2.0,2012-02-26,"Walking into CPK was like entering an alternate universe where there are no adults. Seemingly all of the employees and 75% of the diners here were teenagers. The mall-based location surely plays a role in attracting so many kids, but so does the ""lowest common denominator"" menu that at first glance seems eclectic and creative, but in execution is bland and sterile. It takes a cynical corporate culture to transform Thai, Mexican, and BBQ dishes all into a nonthreatening sameness that nobody alive could have a strong reaction to. This is the kind of restaurant that has a marketing department - not a chef - developing new dishes. Service was poor due to an unusually high diner to wait staff ratio. The beer list was exclusively bland lagers. There are at least five options within a mile radius with better pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-natick?start=40,2.84,2.84,2.84,2.7600000000000007,2.84
13,Rishabh G.,"Waltham, MA",18,101,33.0,5.0,2012-03-19,"This restaurant is a great place to grab some lunch during work or dinner on any night out. The decor of the restaurant is really spacious with a full open view of the kitchen. The staff their is very friendly and offer some great advice on what to get. Most of the drinks have free refills, which is great. The menu is filled with some great choices. My three favorites are the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine, BBQ chopped chicken salad, and the BBQ chicken pizza.  Lets start with the Fettuccine. It's amazing. The chicken is very juicy. The pasta is cooked thoroughly. The sauce is very delicious. It has roasted yellow and red peppers with a hint of lime. It's perfect a perfect dish to try on a warm day. The BBQ chopped chicken salad is great. Fresh lettuce, tomatoes, corn, avocado (extra $2 I believe), juicy chicken and lots more. The salad is dressed well and tastes very refreshing. The BBQ chicken pizza is honestly their best pizza. Crispy crust topped off with BBQ, juicy chicken, red onions, cilantro, and smoked Gouda. It's mouth watering. The portion sizes are really good for all of the dishes. I've also tried the Three Cheese ravioli, which was very simple, yet delicious. Their food tends be very filling and the prices are not that bad. Overall, I highly recommend this place. The food is good, the service is great and fast, and its well priced. Will definitely be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-natick?start=20,2.92,2.92,2.92,3.124,2.92

I got the BBQ chicken pizza the 2nd time, the only thing I wasn't crazy about is the lack of tomato sauce on most of the pizzas.  I get that they try to stick with one theme for the pizza, but I think that pizza is at it's best, regardless of toppings, with tomato sauce.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-natick?start=60,2.92,2.92,2.92,3.12,2.92

My oldest and I split the pepperoni pizza and the problem eater got the kid's cheese (without tomato sauce, naturally).  He ate that cheese pizza so fast, I was almost convinced they did not bring it.  So clearly he is a fan.  I enjoyed the pepperoni - the pizza dough is a little sweet but I have had worse pizza.

53,Robin Y.,"Boston, MA",144,315,421.0,1.0,2013-03-17,"I've been to this location four times and have consistently had the same issues, so I feel comfortable leaving a negative review. Problems: 1) Always crowded. This isn't their fault, because it is at the Natick Mall, but I feel like it's always important to anticipate having to wait for at least 20 minutes if you want to eat here. 2) Often, they will not have the item that you want to order. My fiancé once had to go through five different options to find something that was available that day that he wanted to order. Weird. 3) They make a lot of mistakes. Food is often undercooked, or they just totally ignore any requests for changes that you want to make to a dish. And sometimes if you send something back, it will be brought back to you in seemingly the same condition. I even ordered a dish here once that was totally different than the same one in Wellesley- and not in a good way. 4) If you have dietary restrictions, the waitstaff is totally useless- they don't really know what's in each dish, take forever to find out from the kitchen staff, and are snarky and unhelpful in their responses. If you can't eat gluten or dairy or anything of the sort, do not trust this restaurant- you will be endlessly frustrated and are better off finding somewhere else to go. 5) Nearly everyone who works here is standoffish and annoyed, including the management. If you have a problem, they will not handle it politely, which is the cherry on top of your meal after you wait a really long time to be seated, wait a long time for your fourth- or fifth-choice dish to be brought to you, and have to send it back multiple times before finally getting to eat a dish that's way too expensive considering the quality. I keep giving this place a chance because it's convenient when you're at the mall and they used to have several things that I liked, but they've all been taken off the menu. I didn't want to judge them based on one bad experience, but after several, it's safe to say that I won't be going back. Additionally, I've eaten a bunch of times at other locations in the area (Wellesley and Prudential Center) and have had awesome experiences- quick service, delicious food, and gracious waitstaff. I always leave this location frustrated and dissatisfied, and it isn't even that affordable. Summary: Avoid.

77,Alex B.,"Natick, MA",153,43,2.0,1.0,2013-03-21,"I don't know where to even begin here. But I will attempt to make something happen in this review. Lets start from the only good that I have encountered at this specific location, the bartender, Ramon, grade A service and made the best of what he could. I will note that I tipped him based on his performance rather than the performance of the people I will mention from here on in. Let the complaining begin, I would like to say the problems started when I ordered the food it took forever to come out, and I saw Ramon put it in to the computer. The when my food finally made it out my Jamaican Jerk Chicken Pizza was interesting the pizza it self was hot but the chicken was ice cold. What did I do? I sent it back, after Ramon noticed I was picking off pieces of chicken (about 10 minutes). it was put into the oven for about 10 minutes then given back to me (or so I was told). Chicken, yes, still cold. I did not want to send it back since the person I was out with already had time to finish their food. I ask for a manager, this girl was a riot, when I complained about the cold chicken and the health concerns over food that was served way below any legal temperature, she said ""trust me its cooked you can't get sick from it, so I don't know what your worried about"". Well apparently she missed a whole biology class in high school, some much needed common sense, and probably a food safety course.  Wow that night ended horribly, I was hungry and remained hungry for another two hours because I felt bad dragging someone into another restaurant so I decided that staying hungry might be a bit better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-natick?start=60,2.92,2.92,2.92,2.8520000000000003,2.92

We walked in and were told that there would be a 25-minute wait; on a Saturday evening, that's expected, thus, tolerable. Fast forward 45 minutes. The host had called our name but then some goon claimed that it was his table; when we went up to ask if our name had been called, the host stayed silent while another person said, ""Oh, no I don't think so."" Once the latter had left to whisk some other people to their table, the host came back to us and said, ""Actually, your name WAS called, but someone else took it -- you'll be next."" Dot. Dot. Dot. Was the long wait and the lying worth it? Half of me says yes, because the food really is quite delicious (carnitas with habanero sauce on whole wheat... um, drool!), but the other (more dignified, less carnal) part of me says--quite indignantly--no. When you tell me a wait time, please be honest about it, and if it will take longer than you originally thought, please don't give away our place in line to the first buffoon who pushes his way over to you and claims he's another person just to get his people seated, and please--PLEASE--don't lie to us and say you didn't call our name.

41,Jennifer M.,"Providence, RI",28,25,,5.0,2013-07-30,"I have just had my socks knocked off by a CHAIN. I am very pleasantly surprised. This review is coming to you courtesy of my having felt slightly cruddy all day and a) not feeling up to cooking dinner and b) not thinking my tummy could handle the rich goat cheese stuffed chicken I had planned for dinner. I told my boyfriend that what I really needed in my life was a good salad and we spent a bit of time pondering who in the very immediate area does a really good salad. I was dubious when he suggested CPK. But he linked me to the menu page where they describe their salad offerings, and I decided that a few things looked good, so it was worth a shot. I ordered the half portion of the roasted veggie salad and opted to have it topped with grilled shrimp. I could not BELIEVE how delicious and thoughtfully composed the salad was that I received. This was a plate heaped with roasted artichoke hearts, roasted red and yellow peppers, roasted eggplant, sun dried tomatoes, fresh asparagus, fresh avocado and char grilled corn. Each vegetable had a delicious flavor that brought something valuable to the flavor profile of the dish, and right when you needed a break from those flavors, the lettuce that all of this vegetable heaven was plated atop came to the party, dressed just enough with a bitingly acidic vinaigrette that counteracted the richness of the other vegetables nicely. And all of this is to say nothing of the shrimp!! There were 10 nicely grilled shrimp on my plate! The roasted veggie salad is a total slam dunk. My boyfriend ordered the petite wedge salad for an appetizer and had the carnitas tacos for dinner. He thought the wedge salad was out of this world, but characterized the tacos as a bit too rich, and slightly one note. If he hadn't asked for avocado on it (not the way it comes on the menu) it would have been just beef and lettuce in the taco. He did think the beef was well seasoned and cooked properly, but he did not think he would order the carnitas tacos again. Still, we were impressed with the food, and our server, Travis was very personable and polite.  I can't tell you how many times we have driven by this place choosing to go to one of the many other restaurants in the Natick Collection, and tonight we were kicking ourselves for not trying CPK sooner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-natick?start=40,2.96,2.96,2.96,3.2840000000000003,2.96

I waited probably another 5 minutes and the person came back and took my order - an app and sangria. The sangria was excellent.

Secondly I noticed him cutting mint leaves- he put one in his mouth, chewed it a bit and spit it back out into his hand and threw it into the trash. He Never washed his hands.

Roasted Spinach and Artichoke Thin Crust Pizza (~$15 for a medium) Ordered with two sunny-side up eggs (extra $1). Incredibly tasty. It's basically garlic bread with spinach and artichokes--who could complain? I probably wouldn't order the eggs on a pizza again, though. While visually interesting and a way to get more protein for vegetarians, they were super messy with the thin crust. Also, they only cover two pieces of the pizza. The artichoke was my least favorite part--I'd prefer they use single leaves instead of chunks with multiple leaves as it's a lot of bitterness for one bite.

Never a good sign. But, that is not why I am giving this place a 1 start rating. One of the managers in this place (the older guy with grey hair) gives a new understanding of bad service and being completely heartless! We have a baby and we go out often. We always put the baby seat on the highchair by putting the highchair upside down (the high-chair has a wider base so we are able to place the baby seat on top of it) and safely securing the baby seat on it. Completely safe and stable, we would never jeopardize the safety of our baby- we have one of those expensive baby chairs that have extensions to be placed on highchairs in this manner.  The manager interrupted our meal and took the high-chair away because he said ""it's for insurance reasons"", although both the highchair and baby seat were very stable and secure. He came back with this flimsy cradle thing and asked us to put the baby chair on it. It was simply too dangerous, he saw that it was too unstable and too dangerous to place a baby seat on it. I told him this is not safe, and he simply ignored me and didn't even look me in the face. He saw that we no longer had a place to put the baby seat anywhere. He was not concerned with the safety of our baby, he failed to provide us with an adequate solution (in fact his solution was potentially very dangerous), he didn't apologize and he just treated us with utmost coldheartedness.. walked away as we had our baby on the dining table!

Overall, I'll give them 2 stars because it can be hit or miss apparently.       My wife ordered a chicken dish. When the food came out it looked great, until she bit into it. The bottom side of the chicken was burned pretty badly. Even for someone like me, who likes a little char, this tasted bad.   Upon inspection, each piece was burned on the bottom. Meaning THEY KNEW it was burned, yet served it anyway with the ""good side"" facing out. Did they think we wouldn't notice?!      We waited a few minutes for the waitress to come over and check on things, like they are supposed to. She made eye contact with us, and most definitely knew my wife wasn't eating, but didn't come over. Our drinks were running empty and I had eaten two slices of the pizza I ordered by then. I actually had to flag the waitress down to get her to come over.      The waitress showed up and didn't even apologize.  She didn't even offer a new plate until my wife asked. Like we were just showing her burned food for fun or something. After a pause, she told us she'd get a new one in, and left. Normally I don't dock tip money for this, as the waitresses don't cook the food. However, this waitress knew we had an issue and ignored us, then didn't remove the food from the table, leaving my hungry wife to munch on arugula and cheese with this food sitting in front of her.  I could have shared my pizza, but my wife doesn't do spicy.  The waitress went from my standard 20 to 15(should have gone lower), and still didn't refill our drinks.       Onto the drinks! I noticed my glass was cracked 90% around the center. While waiting for the waitress, some man with an ear piece came over to check my wife's food. I assume he was the manager, but he never introduced himself, so who knows. He apogized for the food and finally took the plate. This is when I brought the glass to his attention. He picked up the glass and said, ""interesting"" and took it away. I was still eating my pizza and NEVER got a refill. I paid for that drink...  Even when the waitress brought the 2nd plate out, she still didn't offer a refill. We had to ask, and STILL only got 1.     Finally, my pizza. I ordered a ""crispy"" thin crust. It was good... but the crust wasn't fully cooked. I could tell because it was chewy. So much so, with each bite, I had to grip the pizza with my off hand and pull. Pizza, let alone crispy crust pizza, shouldn't need that kind of attention.  I ate it though, because I'm not super picky and like I said, it tasted good.      When all was said and done, we only got 8 dollars off our order. Half of what my wife's meal cost. I'm not cheap, so I didn't fight for more as easy as it would have been.  Also, my tip was 15 percent of the bill before the discount.       I don't like giving bad reviews, as I'm not a complainer. However, the only things that were brought to the staffs attention were the burned food and broken glass. I feel like our experience needed to be publicized as it was the worst restaurant experience I've had in a LONG time.       OH!! Almost forgot the green gunk stuck to one of the forks.

25,Olivia W.,"Cambridge, MA",63,118,30.0,3.0,2017-08-18,"My experience here was average. The service was fine, the food was fine and the overall feel of the place was friendly. I have nothing to complain about, but that being said, I have nothing to rave about either. If you've been to CPK before this is just another extension of the chain. They do have a great location in the mall though - it's a good option for when Cheesecake Factory is overcrowded.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-natick,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84

23,Indiana G.,"Billerica, MA",12,1,1.0,2.0,2017-11-25,"Well let's not go too deep here, I'll just give you what you need to know.  First of all, the waitress is very rushed. She out too much Italian seasoning in it and we couldn't eat the oil. My friend asked for the STRAWBERRY iced tea, but she got RASPBERRY? Um.. We sucked it up tho. We asked for a refill, she didn't give us that either. After that we got our appetizer. We asked for a salad with ranch instead of blue cheese. She got to our table and gave us blue cheese.. So she didn't eat it. I guess the food was alright. But service, terrible. After that, we finished our meal, but where was our waitress? She seemed to be walking around in circles not even knowing what to do.  If your server is named Pat, make sure to ask for another server, trust me, it's worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-natick,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92

21,E T.,"West Hollywood, CA",28,453,164.0,3.0,2017-12-09,"Nothing wring with this place. Nothing amazing. I hosted a business lunch at this place for 5 clients and was actually pretty surprised as large and upscale as the Natick Mall (oops sorry ... Collection! Eye roll) is, there is a lack of decent restaurants here. You'd think there would be a Steakhouse/seafood spot like McCormick and Scmitt or Capitol Grille. Met Bar sucks and isn't really good for business given the open concept. I will say that making a reservation here at CPK was not easy. I kept getting put on hold and shuffled around and ultimately when we showed up, nobody had our reservation down. Plus parking is a bitch and a half in December! The decor is surprisingly modern and classy for a pizza place. The set up is good for business as there are booths and tables which are fairly spread out so you can talk without being overheard by someone right on top of you. It's not noisy at all, even when crowded. The biggest takeaway is that the last thing you want to get here is the pizza. They are very small, kind of skimpy on the ingredients and sort of bland. We got 4 pizzas for 5 people ($50!) and after we were done eating them, we all kind of looked at each other like, 'are you still hungry?' so we ended up ordering sandwiches. Ha ha ($12-$15 each!) The sandwiches were the star of the show. Very big portion and all tasted fairly fresh and tasty. The pizza was like salty cardboard compared. They have an okay drink menu although the non alchoholic homemade sodas were great, made with fresh fruit. Wolfgang Puck created California Pizza Kitchen in the 80s back when pizza was just pizza with no creative toppings. He invented the BBQ chicken pizza and put shrimp on pizza which was very innovative for the time. He sold the concept years ago and it appears it was purchased by a corporation who cut costs on freshness and ingredients, so that's what you get today. Souless frozen pizza ... Stick with the sandwiches and burgers. All my stars are for atmosphere, service and the ease to do business here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-natick,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92
