The half portion turned out to be enough to fill me up. It contained spinach, grilled peach slices, pecans, cranberries, feta cheese, grilled chicken (for extra), and a very light dressing. I thought the extras that came with the salad were more than enough; every bite was flavorful and even made me forget that I was eating ""rabbit food""! I was pleasantly surprised by the kids' menu too - lots of choices and very reasonably priced. Where is the $1 dessert menu for grown-ups?

It's close to my office and it was one of those times when I had no hankering for anything in particular. Both times I got the same pizza - the original BBQ Chicken. It's actually one of my favorites here. BBQ sauce, smoked gouda, mozzarella, BBQ chicken, red onions and cilantro. I like almost anything with BBQ sauce on it! This is a pretty decent pie and I easily finish it by myself, then pass out in my office in a food coma. Not a bad price at around $13 but a bit on the high side for chain store pizza. One qualm I have about this place is that there are no lunch specials. Ever. Sheesh - you would think being in a main stretch of Park Ave South where there are a ton of offices and working people they would give us a little something of a deal. Maybe that is why it always seems mostly empty during lunch time. There are a lot of other options in the area for a cheaper lunch. This location is quite large and spacious with plenty of seating. Service is ok if a bit distant. Sometimes you need to flag them down or wait a bit for someone to come by. The menu is pretty big here and offers much more than pizzas, such as pastas, salads, soups, tacos, sandwiches, desserts, etc. It's a totally casual dining spot and they also serve beer and wine.

392,Phil H.,"New York, United States",5000,3190,11370.0,3.0,2012-08-15,"Ok, I broke down and have to admit that I have eaten here a few times. Sometimes you just get the urge for chain store pizza. It's close to my office and it was one of those times when I had no hankering for anything in particular. Both times I got the same pizza - the original BBQ Chicken. It's actually one of my favorites here. BBQ sauce, smoked gouda, mozzarella, BBQ chicken, red onions and cilantro. I like almost anything with BBQ sauce on it! This is a pretty decent pie and I easily finish it by myself, then pass out in my office in a food coma. Not a bad price at around $13 but a bit on the high side for chain store pizza. One qualm I have about this place is that there are no lunch specials. Ever. Sheesh - you would think being in a main stretch of Park Ave South where there are a ton of offices and working people they would give us a little something of a deal. Maybe that is why it always seems mostly empty during lunch time. There are a lot of other options in the area for a cheaper lunch. This location is quite large and spacious with plenty of seating. Service is ok if a bit distant. Sometimes you need to flag them down or wait a bit for someone to come by. The menu is pretty big here and offers much more than pizzas, such as pastas, salads, soups, tacos, sandwiches, desserts, etc. It's a totally casual dining spot and they also serve beer and wine.

I have to dock points though and I'm not sure if this is because we just had bad luck, but the wait was abysmally long. We ordered our first two pizzas and received them about half an hour later. Because we knew they took a while, we ordered the second set of two just before we started to eat, but we had finished eating in about ten minutes and still had to wait another thirty to forty-five minutes for our pizzas to arrive. It's a little disappointing when you're waiting to get the rest of the pizzas so you can just pay the bill and go already. Overall, the atmosphere seems pretty good for groups and the pizzas are quite decent.

The wild mushroom was my personal favorite (get the truffle oil!). The rest of the pizzas were pretty good, but nothing to write home about. The slices are also a little small, so you might want about four slices to get full. I have to dock points though and I'm not sure if this is because we just had bad luck, but the wait was abysmally long. We ordered our first two pizzas and received them about half an hour later. Because we knew they took a while, we ordered the second set of two just before we started to eat, but we had finished eating in about ten minutes and still had to wait another thirty to forty-five minutes for our pizzas to arrive. It's a little disappointing when you're waiting to get the rest of the pizzas so you can just pay the bill and go already. Overall, the atmosphere seems pretty good for groups and the pizzas are quite decent. It may have been that we had bad luck with the wait, but if it normally takes that long for food to come, I'd recommend just having pizza elsewhere.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-new-york-2?start=140,3.88,3.55,3.5,3.2120000000000006,3.682

I came here on Veteran's Day along with another veteran.  The waitress was very prompt and patient with us...we couldn't decide what to order for appetizer, drinks and/or meals.  They had a limited menu for Veteran's Day, which is fine, because, hey - it's a free meal!  I had the Hawaiian pizza, which was okay;however, my friend had some sort of Cuban pizza with pork and spicy salsa sauce on the side.  I'm not a huge fan of pork, so the first bite was okay...then after a few more bites, I really liked it!  It has a kick, so if you can't handle spicy, I wouldn't recommend getting it.

We escaped the first family by asking to be moved only to have another huge ensemble swiftly move in to our new location.

76,Andrew S.,"Queens, NY",251,520,882.0,4.0,2015-02-12,"California Kitchen serves pretty good gourmet style pizza. The crust is light and has a bit of a puffed crisp bubble, light in chewiness but not rubber chewy with a tad of crisp to it, just right in pretzel meets bread. The rest of the dough/bread part of the pizza is thin and soft; it is incorporated well with the top ingredients, well the cheese mostly. The cheese is of a decent flavor, not over powering with milk flavor, just right. It's good pizza. Had the Habanero Pizza and one out of ten bites, I detected a SMIDGEN of hotness. Habanero? Rename it please. The flavorful indeed the pizza is but mixed in with the other ingredients it tasted more like a ceviche pizza with the onions and cilantro. It had red pieced of delicious chicken that were very soft, stringy and just right. I didn't burn my mouth but at the very least spice up a pizza called Habanero a bit. Over all the pizza was flavorful. And I thought the pizza was good. Only complaint and I know the area I am in but: $14 and change not considering tax and tip for a six slice pie of 10 inch tininess. You BETTER call yourself gourmet pizza. The seating is well provided and the place is big. The ambience reminds me of a business meets fast food type of place and definitely fits into Manhattan.

335,Ladiny P.,"New York, United States",80,51,227.0,4.0,2015-07-10,"I have been to this restaurant many times and the customer service and food varied by the branches I went. Personally, my favorite so far has been the one on Park Ave and 30th street. The service given by the waitress and the host was very friendly, and they even told us how to get complimentary small plates.  I came here with my best friend after doing a couple of hours of volunteer work around the community. When we arrived, the host took us to our table and told us about their loyalty card; once you sign up you get a complimentary small plate or flatbread, so we signed up for it. Then the waitress arrived and told us if we checked in on Facebook, we would get complimentary guac and chips. Both came out and they were completely delicious. My all time favorite dish from this establishment has got to be the Thai Crunch Salad. The salad contains crisp vegetables (mainly lettuce) and fresh cilantro with chicken and crushed peanuts, wontons and rice crips. The salad is tossed with peanut sauce dressing. I completely love the crunch of all the components of the salad as well as the hint of spice from the peanut dressing. Every time I come here I always ordered the thai crunch salad (half portion: $11.99) In terms of the pizza, I am particularly not a big fan of the pizza, because it does lack the tomato sauce and I found the dough of the pizza to be too thick that it overtook the whole taste of the pizza; an uneven balance of toppings and dough Food: kind of pricey ($11-$25), salad portion is worth the price, food wait: 10-15 min Atmosphere: pretty upscale, one of the fanciest pizza joints I have been to, but modern and casual Service: This establishment exactly, very friendly hosts and waitresses, cater to your needs even when you have an issue with the check.

We escaped the first family by asking to be moved only to have another huge ensemble swiftly move in to our new location.

155,David B.,"New York, NY",59,140,2.0,4.0,2015-08-11,"California Pizza Kitchen has surprised me. The chain has unveiled a new look and expanded menu that goes well beyond pizza. The best part - you don't need to travel to California to check it out. Head to CPK in Midtown to eat your way through the reimagined menu and check out the new rustic interior. I was invited in to CPK a few weeks ago and had an incredible time. The new menu still has the traditional pizzas you know and love (can you say BBQ chicken?), but new menu options are available in every category. We're talking everything from Maine Lobster Flatbread to Fire-Grilled Ribeye to Hearth-Roasted Halibut all showcasing seasonally inspired ingredients. These new entrees certainly don't shy away from flavor. The halibut was incredibly flavorful and sat on a bed of grilled asparagus, butternut squash and baby kale. The roasted garlic chicken consisted of crispy-skin chicken breasts in a lemon garlic sauce with roasted fingerling potatoes, carrots, cauliflower and herbs. I'm even going to go as far to say this chicken dish was some of the best chicken I've ever had... ever. Wait a minute, is this really California Pizza Kitchen? The drink menu has been reinvented as well. Creative new beverages include hand-crafted cocktails made from fresh fruits, juices, purees, and herbs. A must-try is the California Roots, a drink made of vodka, avocado, mint and agave. Apparently, you can put avocado in a drink.  Hopefully I've now convinced you that the food is good, really good. Well, the interior mirrors the reimagined menu. Walking into California Pizza Kitchen, I didn't feel like I was at another chain restaurant. I felt like this place belonged in NYC. There are new oak floors, tabletops and chairs made from reclaimed wood and stone countertops. Fabrics used for seating are from recycled materials and the restaurant features a natural herb garden. Artwork on the walls features local New York landmarks for a neighborhood feel. Additionally, the open floorplan has an open kitchen where guests can watch as food is prepared from scratch and artisan pizzas are hand-tossed and cooked in the open-hearth oven. If this is what chain restaurants are turning into, sign me up. California Pizza Kitchen in Midtown has certainly exceeded the ""pizza"" in its name to become a neighborhood space to relax with some good drinks and even better food. Check them out!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-new-york-2?start=60,3.92,3.98,3.72,3.664,3.9560000000000004

75,Ladiny P.,"New York, NY",80,51,227.0,4.0,2015-10-07,"I have been to this restaurant many times and the customer service and food varied by the branches I went. Personally, my favorite so far has been the one on Park Ave and 30th street. The service given by the waitress and the host was very friendly, and they even told us how to get complimentary small plates.  I came here with my best friend after doing a couple of hours of volunteer work around the community. When we arrived, the host took us to our table and told us about their loyalty card; once you sign up you get a complimentary small plate or flatbread, so we signed up for it. Then the waitress arrived and told us if we checked in on Facebook, we would get complimentary guac and chips. Both came out and they were completely delicious. My all time favorite dish from this establishment has got to be the Thai Crunch Salad. The salad contains crisp vegetables (mainly lettuce) and fresh cilantro with chicken and crushed peanuts, wontons and rice crips. The salad is tossed with peanut sauce dressing. I completely love the crunch of all the components of the salad as well as the hint of spice from the peanut dressing. Every time I come here I always ordered the thai crunch salad (half portion: $11.99) In terms of the pizza, I am particularly not a big fan of the pizza, because it does lack the tomato sauce and I found the dough of the pizza to be too thick that it overtook the whole taste of the pizza; an uneven balance of toppings and dough Food: kind of pricey ($11-$25), salad portion is worth the price, food wait: 10-15 min Atmosphere: pretty upscale, one of the fanciest pizza joints I have been to, but modern and casual Service: This establishment exactly, very friendly hosts and waitresses, cater to your needs even when you have an issue with the check.

355,David B.,"New York, United States",59,140,2.0,4.0,2015-11-08,"California Pizza Kitchen has surprised me. The chain has unveiled a new look and expanded menu that goes well beyond pizza. The best part - you don't need to travel to California to check it out. Head to CPK in Midtown to eat your way through the reimagined menu and check out the new rustic interior. I was invited in to CPK a few weeks ago and had an incredible time. The new menu still has the traditional pizzas you know and love (can you say BBQ chicken?), but new menu options are available in every category. We're talking everything from Maine Lobster Flatbread to Fire-Grilled Ribeye to Hearth-Roasted Halibut all showcasing seasonally inspired ingredients. These new entrees certainly don't shy away from flavor. The halibut was incredibly flavorful and sat on a bed of grilled asparagus, butternut squash and baby kale. The roasted garlic chicken consisted of crispy-skin chicken breasts in a lemon garlic sauce with roasted fingerling potatoes, carrots, cauliflower and herbs. I'm even going to go as far to say this chicken dish was some of the best chicken I've ever had... ever. Wait a minute, is this really California Pizza Kitchen? The drink menu has been reinvented as well. Creative new beverages include hand-crafted cocktails made from fresh fruits, juices, purees, and herbs. A must-try is the California Roots, a drink made of vodka, avocado, mint and agave. Apparently, you can put avocado in a drink.  Hopefully I've now convinced you that the food is good, really good. Well, the interior mirrors the reimagined menu. Walking into California Pizza Kitchen, I didn't feel like I was at another chain restaurant. I felt like this place belonged in NYC. There are new oak floors, tabletops and chairs made from reclaimed wood and stone countertops. Fabrics used for seating are from recycled materials and the restaurant features a natural herb garden. Artwork on the walls features local New York landmarks for a neighborhood feel. Additionally, the open floorplan has an open kitchen where guests can watch as food is prepared from scratch and artisan pizzas are hand-tossed and cooked in the open-hearth oven. If this is what chain restaurants are turning into, sign me up. California Pizza Kitchen in Midtown has certainly exceeded the ""pizza"" in its name to become a neighborhood space to relax with some good drinks and even better food.

336,Andrew S.,"Queens, United States",251,520,882.0,4.0,2015-12-02,"California Kitchen serves pretty good gourmet style pizza. The crust is light and has a bit of a puffed crisp bubble, light in chewiness but not rubber chewy with a tad of crisp to it, just right in pretzel meets bread. The rest of the dough/bread part of the pizza is thin and soft; it is incorporated well with the top ingredients, well the cheese mostly. The cheese is of a decent flavor, not over powering with milk flavor, just right. It's good pizza. Had the Habanero Pizza and one out of ten bites, I detected a SMIDGEN of hotness. Habanero? Rename it please. The flavorful indeed the pizza is but mixed in with the other ingredients it tasted more like a ceviche pizza with the onions and cilantro. It had red pieced of delicious chicken that were very soft, stringy and just right. I didn't burn my mouth but at the very least spice up a pizza called Habanero a bit. Over all the pizza was flavorful. And I thought the pizza was good. Only complaint and I know the area I am in but: $14 and change not considering tax and tip for a six slice pie of 10 inch tininess. You BETTER call yourself gourmet pizza. The seating is well provided and the place is big. The ambience reminds me of a business meets fast food type of place and definitely fits into Manhattan.

The bartender did a great job. During this visit, I had the lime margarita which was smaller than I am usually accustomed to but good nonetheless. My fiancé had a blue Long Island which was AMAZING.

It's served with a cilantro lime sauce which I loved dipping my slices in. No appetizers really needed here as they serve you bread before hand (although the apps did sound good). Even the wine was great which I didn't expect considering it was a 40 dollar bottle. I also know nothing about wine so don't ask me.

Nope because I live here and sometimes I just crave the chain restaurant taste. I've only been to this franchise once in Cali so I had to come back even if it was in NYC. I ordered the Spicy Chipotle Chicken pizza and it was delicious. It's served with a cilantro lime sauce which I loved dipping my slices in. No appetizers really needed here as they serve you bread before hand (although the apps did sound good). Even the wine was great which I didn't expect considering it was a 40 dollar bottle. I also know nothing about wine so don't ask me.

I've never seen a standalone location until this one.  The food is pretty much what you'd expect from a restaurant chain. Decent, but generic tasting. Still, it always works as a lunch spot with co-workers and they offer a wide range of menu items that can please even the pickiest of eaters or those with dietary restrictions (hint: gluten-free pizza). I also rather enjoy their pastas, despite that there's gotta be a crapload of sodium and preservatives in those sauces (or maybe because of?).  Portions are huge and I can never finish anything without having leftovers, be it with pizza, pasta, or salad. A least you get your money's worth.

302,Lydia W.,"Douglaston, United States",70,30,5.0,3.0,2017-03-06,"I walk by this CPK maybe twice a day and have always shuddered at the thought of a chain restaurant having a posted 'C' rating in Murray Hill. One of my friends suggested we go for a quick Friday lunch and I spent too long looking online for a CPK meal option that would be semi-healthy AND wasn't ridiculous for the listed price. The location was relatively empty and the noise level was down to a quiet chatter. We were quickly seated in a booth that had a great view of the pizza oven and the takeout counter. Not too shabby! Upon walking in, we were greeted by a friendly hostess and Julia, our lovely server. Julia came by regularly to take our orders and walk me through the lunch duo menu. Wanting to get in some protein for lunch, I inquired about adding shrimp to my small salad. My bad for wanting to treat myself to some protein, eh? It's really not the location's fault, but I believe it was 6 shrimp for $5 or vice versa. Either way, I couldn't quite justify that price for such a small quantity of shrimp when it's about $6/pound for shrimp at my local grocery store. I ordered a lunch duo of a small Caesar salad and Dakota Smashed Pea & Barley soup. For lunch, it would do and although my dining companion picked up the check this time, I wouldn't find myself paying over $7 for a cup of soup and a side salad (without a real protein).  My croutons had a taste that was reminded me a lot of star anise. I'm not sure if CPK buys their croutons from a supplier or intentionally overseasons them, but the taste was too strong.  My dining companion ordered two appetizers/starters of White Corn Guacamole and a dumpling dish. She thoroughly enjoyed her meal choices. It's probably a personal preference, but dumplings at a chain pizza restaurant? I can see how chains like CPK do well in the suburbs, but it's difficult being a jack of all trades. I'm not sure I would be back to try other items on the menu, because the price doesn't come close to justifying the quality of food. The menu lacks a cohesive theme other than 'mid-level bar food' or 'casual lunch spot.' For the price they're charging, Midtown has no shortage of even other chain restaurants that can also hit those notes for less money.

The convenience of this location will never offset terrible service (not only is it ridiculously slow but the attitude coming from the staff is astounding). We won't be back unless there is a serious change in management. So disappointing.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-new-york-2?start=20,3.36,2.93,3.384,,3.1020000000000003

I always get the personal pie when I come here because I've tried different ones and I really wasn't a big fan. I love Hawaiian pizza but this isn't the place to get it at. You can find pizza like this in other places and for wayyyy cheaper l. Not bad but not the best, but I do love their cheese pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-new-york-2,3.44,2.92,3.38,,3.128

Our waiter Amado took over 20 minutes to come over and serve us and had the audacity to say ""oh well I.T sounds like you're not ready to order"" we ordered literally one course and once we were done with our meal waited over another 30 minutes to receive the check. I said excuse me and he purposely ignored me and proceeded to go to other tables.
