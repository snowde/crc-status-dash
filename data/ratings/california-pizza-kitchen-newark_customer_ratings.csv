The food is consistent with other CPK locations I have visited. They have quite a few lunch options on the lighter side.  I have two complaints about this location. First, there is a musty, damp, wet dog smell. You will notice it upon walking in and you will eventually get used to it but it is not appetizing. Secondly, the waitstaff is rather slow so it is not ideal for a quick lunch. I would recommend hopping over to another location in the Christiana mall if you are just out on your lunch break.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newark?start=20,2.636,2.636,2.636,2.636,2.636
45,R. K.,"Broomall, PA",0,36,,1.0,2012-10-24,"Let me first say, that the food is delicious. A half salad here is the size of a normal salad at other restaurants, and the pizza options seem endless. With that being said, the wait staff is AWFUL! I have been to other CPK's when it was extremely busy, and received stellar service. This was my first and LAST visit to this location. I came here for lunch on a Saturday and it was extremely slow.....I thought it would be a plus for us, it wasn't. The hostess sat us and we waited over 10 minutes for our server. When she finally did appear, we put in our drink and lunch orders. She didn't return again until our food came. Midway through our lunch, both drinks were very empty....but let me just say, she had another table around us and could have stopped twice before this to check in on us. Finally, I got up and went to the kitchen area to get refills. Apparently, the kitchen is where ALL the wait staff hang out. I saw our waitress, but she let another waiter come up to me and asked what I needed. I was polite and asked him if I could get refills of our drink, then this smart ass tells me it's going to be $20.....haha, I get it your a comedian, but i'm thirsty. Our waitress, then comes up takes the glasses and tells me they will be right out.....like 5 minutes later. I really don't know what was up with the wait staff here. It was not busy at all, and it seemed like they couldn't handle two tables each. My advice to their management would be to can your wait staff that was working the lunch shift on Saturday Oct. 20.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newark?start=40,2.436,2.436,2.436,2.436,2.436

Came here on the early side of Saturday night after picking up some stuff from the mall.  Haven't been to one of these guys since I was much younger.  The menu's changed, axing some of my favorites (RIP Peking Duck Pizza) in favor of a more concise menu.  We split an original crust (Chipotle Chicken) and a thin crust (Spinach and Artichoke) pizza, and I gotta say the thin crust was leaps and bounds better: less doughy, able to taste the toppings more, and just felt more like pizza.  But on the whole, the food was nothing special.   Service was fine and pricewise it's super affordable.  My only complaint is that it was just really loud and there were a lot of families (as there should be at a mall restaurant on the early side of a weekend night).  I couldn't understand why people would want to wait (it's just not worth it).  Overall, it's fine if you're looking for a sit down place with inexpensive gourmet-ish food that tastes pretty good, but I've had better elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newark?start=20,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003

Unfortunately, our experience with the service we received was below our expectations. Our server was inattentive to our needs. We had requested our daughter's dish (Fettuccini with Alfredo sauce) to come before or during our appetizer. When the appetizer was delivered by another member of the serving team, we did not have the pasta for our daughter. When we asked about the dish we were rushed a lukewarm to cool dish. Drinks were not taken away once finished, requests for refills were delayed to the point I cancelled my drink order. We were interested in dessert, but considering the turnaround we saw in our requests, we decided against dessert shortly after we received our dessert menu. After waiting for 10 minutes I asked for the check and left dissatisfied.  Our food was fine. Chipotle pizza was decent, but a bit over-done.

There. Do you feel better for accusing me of ""chain restaurant eating""? My excuse is that I was getting my 10k steps at the Christiana Mall during a freezing rain storm and I didn't really want to go drive somewhere else. :-) Very slow on a midweek night, I was Dan's only customer. It started off poorly, as they were out of the non-alcoholic beers on the drink menu and I ended up with a $2.69 glass of club soda. Yep, $2.69 for fizzy water. I started off with the chips and corn guacamole which was a nice appetizer. Not too big, not too much. Just enough to get your tummy running and ready for the main course. I wanted to try something different and not mainstream, but instead chose their famous barbecue chicken pizza. Very nicely cooked, very delicious combination of chicken, onions and some sort of smoked cheese. It still needed some red pepper flakes to kick up the heat, but otherwise was excellent. I can understand why these have been so successful for CPK. Wifi worked, but not perfectly. It was a little slow.

Once our soup was almost gone she brought us bread and told us to eat it with our soup. Then she walked away bc a previous customer had returned and requested her.

When we received our food, which was delicious, we had previously requested extra sauce. Receiving this sauce from someone else, it was ice cold. Because our waitress was not attentive we started eating our pizza until she arrived to heat the sauce. She did not look interested in being at work or happy to be around people.

NEVER will I return here again.  I don't remember the servers name, but if you have a young guy (early 20's) with dark hair, just leave while you can.  This establishment is an embarrassment.  Like I said, I've worked in a restaurant.  I know stuff happens, but if standing around talking to other servers is more important than providing service to a whopping two small tables, then this is not the job for you.  I am glad I was able to vent on Yelp, because I really don't think the manager understood how upset we were.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newark?start=20,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005

3,Q E.,"Washington, DC",1,10,30.0,3.0,2017-06-10,My husband and I normally go to the California Pizza Kitchen in MD but decided to venture to DE to do something different.  We always sit at the bar.  Today when we got to the bar this gentleman was busy pouring his friends drinks and wondering where the party was later that evening.  He didn't even approach us until 5 minutes later but when he did he felt irritated because he had to leave his conversation with his friends. He took our order but when our salads came out he didn't offer any cracked pepper or napkins.  I suggest to this location retrain your bartenders.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newark,3.28,3.28,3.28,,3.2800000000000002

0,Renee D.,"Philadelphia, PA",56,145,555.0,4.0,2017-07-31,I wanted to take the time to update my review of CPK and call attention to their awesome customer service. In response to my previous review they reached out to me to discuss the situation and graciously invited me back.  I have since dined in once more and gotten take out three times. Each time service was excellent as was the food. I especially like the Kung Pao Spaghetti and The Jambalaya Pasta.  Thank you CPK for taking care of your customer. I am a fan more than ever now.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newark,3.36,3.36,3.36,,3.3600000000000003
2,K. Anand S.,"Leesburg, VA",1,112,8.0,3.0,2017-10-23,Food was decent but was disappointed that the pizzas were not perfect. The crust for the veggie tostada pizza was too burnt. The southwest pizza was good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newark,3.32,3.32,3.32,,3.3200000000000003
4,Rachel D.,"Dallas, TX",90,13,2.0,1.0,2017-10-31,"We came on a week night where we were among the only patrons and our food took an outrageous amount of time to come. Our kids food came out well ahead of ours but still long after we arrived. By the time our food came, our kids were done eating and ready to leave. Our waitress apologized saying that (even though we were the only guests there) no pizza dough had been prepared and it had to be made from scratch. That's inexcusable for a restaurant CALLED California PIZZA Kitchen. No compensation was made to rectify the situation. Even though our food took forever, there was no shortage of staff shooting the breeze and playing around. We won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newark,3.2,3.2,3.2,,3.2000000000000006
