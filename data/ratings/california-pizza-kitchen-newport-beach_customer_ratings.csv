When we went to the CPK in Fashion Island a couple of days before Christmas, it was very crowded. Even so, the service was very good. Our server, Oscar, anticipated our every need and want.

110,Kelly T.,"Portland, OR",0,39,2.0,2.0,2012-02-06,"Less than a year ago CPK came out with a gluten-free crust. Yay. Apparently they (or at least this location) no longer have that. The staff was very friendly and straightforward about this and even helped me locate the gf entrees marked on their normal menu before seating. All 1 of them. 1. Single. GF. Item.   This 1 item happened to be the salmon - with the substitution of stir fried veggies for whatever the normal addition was. This also happens to be one of the most expensive menu items there ($18). I should have simply walked out and gone the ten feet to PF Changs but the bf has an aversion to good food and wanted pizza. The salmon was dry and small. The veggies were veggie-like and bountiful. I'm not sure if there is normally a sauce of some type that goes over the salmon, but don't bother ordering it even if there is. I couldn't even finish it. You're better off getting a salmon fillet from the grocery store and tossing it in the toaster oven at home.  -Great service from both the host and waitstaff -If you want a gf pizza at a chain place, go to BJs. It's by the Balboa Pier -Don't order the salmon",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newport-beach?start=120,2.92,2.92,2.92,2.2800000000000002,2.92
69,Lica N.,"Orange County, CA",1055,508,2582.0,3.0,2012-03-20,"Had lunch here with coworkers who were visiting from out of town.  Again not my choice but it had been years since I ate at a CPK so I was up for it.  It was so odd I never realized there was a CPK right next PF Changs. We got there before the lunch rush and sat near the window so they can look out to the beautiful pacific ocean. The menu is has your normal items from appetizers, salads, soups pizza etc.  Well since the restaurant is called California PIZZA kitchen I decided to go with a pizza. White Pizza ~   The pizza has Mozzarella, Fontina, Ricotta, Parmesan, Pecorino Romano and sautéed garlic spinach. They also listed Applewood Smoked Bacon so I added that to mine.  The crust was thinner than your typical delivery pizza but thicker than your thin crust.  It didn't have any sauce so the crust was not soggy.  The 5 cheeses all blended really well together.  The spinach was a great addition although I didn't taste any of the garlic.  The bacon brought it all home as it often does in a dish! Drank it down with mango iced tea.  Warning the tea is already sweetened. Eyes ~ So nice seeing the ocean while having lunch! Nose ~ Is that pizza I smell?!?! Mouth ~ Taste pretty good! Tummy ~ Only ate half but satisfied.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newport-beach?start=80,2.88,2.88,2.88,2.38,2.88
113,Denise K.,"Huntington Beach, CA",690,409,537.0,4.0,2012-03-29,"CPK was one of my favorite restaurants as a child. Nowadays, I tend to eat at CPK less often but it's still a good place to satisfy my pizza cravings. I love their salads and pizzas. The pastas are a little whatever for the price... You could probably get much better pasta for the price. Nevertheless, the boyfriend and I decided to try this place for lunch while we were at Fashion Island and were seated right away. The place wasn't busy, but the workers were all very attentive and service was great! Our waiter and then later the waitress who took over were both very friendly and talkative, and our food came out quickly. We had the white corn guacamole and chips for our appetizer and then shared the california club pizza and four cheese ravioli. The white corn guacamole tasted really fresh and was really good for only about 4 bucks! The california club pizza was delicious - there's really nothing like a CPK pizza. It looked like a salad on my pizza! And the avocado on top just made the dish. Of course, the four cheese ravioli was pretty good but nothing amazing. We were so full and couldn't even finish our pizza but when I do save room, I always get their tiramisu for dessert. Nice place to come for a cute lunch date. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newport-beach?start=120,2.88,2.88,2.88,2.416,2.88

177,Shawn C.,"Miami, FL",0,4,,1.0,2012-04-15,"First and last time eating here. I thought the waiter was joking when he brought out my Hawaiian; it looked like a kid's pizza, and the food quality was very low. I would much prefer Papa John's over CPK. I don't know how they can serve crap like that with a straight face(for $12 no less!). My wife had the chicken pasta, and again it was very low quality food. She ate the couple of small pieces of chicken and couldn't stomach the rest. Very disappointing food, and a total waste of money. I'm not sure how CPK is able to stay in business judging by their food. The people at the tables around ours didn't seem very enthused about their food, either.

I love CPK, but my most recent visit to the one in Fashion Island Mall in Newport Beach left me with a bad taste in mouth and not due to the food! We are in Newport Beach on vacation. There wasn't a long wait, nor a lot of people in the restaurant, hostess said a 10-15 min wait, no biggie, so I gave my name. There was two other parties ahead of us. Suddenly, this older guy comes in with some kids asks for a table, hostess tells him there is a 10-15 minute wait, he become perturbed and asks why when there are so many tables available (he never took any of us waiting into consideration) so the hostess seats his party BEFORE any of us. I asked why and she said it was because he had come in a few minutes before, I said no he didn't you just told him about the wait and he got perturbed and so you seated him before us. She then said ""well, it's because he has a bigger party then you"" ???? What? She blatantly lied to me. I told her to take me off the list, and she just smiled.

115,Julienne C.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,19,1.0,1.0,2012-05-29,"I love CPK: Just not this one. If it weren't for the wonderful lady I talked to on the phone today I would have given them a one star rating. EDIT: The manager was supposed to refund our salad lunch(we ordered a full salad but were given a half salad that was pass off as a full salad) BUT NEVER DID.  Day I visited: May 23rd, 2012 at about 2pm. Who I went with: My 2 friends and my one year old son. Location wise it's not the greatest. If you've never been to Fashion Island before you will miss it. It's hidden in the corner by PF Changs and on the other side there is The Cheesecake Factory.  There weren't that many guests inside and the greeter was not insight. We waited a couple minutes and finally were greeted and seated in the way back near the bathrooms. The bathrooms are clean but do not have any baby changing tables so parents remember to change your little one in one of the bathrooms near the movie theatres. Even though there were only a few people inside the restaurant it took a while for the waiter to come our way. I don't mind waiting but it did get annoying trying to catch our waiters attention where we were seated in the way back so no one could see us. Did I mention we were near the bathrooms? Yeah. That's kind of gross. From the time we were seated to the time it took our orders to arrive took about 45 minutes. Maybe they forgot about us? I don't know but it took forever for them to take our orders. We ordered one full size Original Chopped Salad, full size Caramelized Peaches Salad and a California Club Pizza. Our pizza was pretty good but I wish it was served hot instead of warm. It took way too long for them to serve us our food and I'm pretty sure they forgot we were seated in the back. When our salads arrived I was confused because we ordered full size salads but they came in small plates. When I questioned our waiter on whether we were mistakenly served the half sized dish he got agitated and told us that our small salads were the full sized ones. I didn't want to send the salad back because it took so long for them to make it and by that time my son was so hungry he was crying. I went to a different CPK a few days ago and ordered a half salad for dinner and when it arrived it came on the same small plate my friends and I were served the last time we went and was told off that it was a full size salad. I asked the waitress if the full size salads were served on the same plates and she told us the full size salads are served on their big oval bowl like plates and they would never be served on their small plates. I called the CPK at Fashion Island to tell them that their cooks and waiters passing off the half salads as a full size one and the manager I talked to today was very nice and said she would talk to her staff. She also offered a certificate as an apology for what happened and explained that they were currently in the process of cutting back the number of plates they use and was probably a mix up on their part. EDIT: Did not receive a refund and it has been a month since my friends and I visited. Go to the location at either Irvine Spectrum or the one off Michelson in Irvine.

We were starving, and just wanted some bread.  We watched in dismay as the tables around us all were served plates of bread & butter, but not us.  Our waiter came to take the order, so we mentioned that we would like bread as well, but he still did not come to our rescue.  After getting our pizza, we just wanted the bread out of principle.  It was cold and a bit stale. Our waiter seemed to be in such a hurry that he would jet off before we could even ask a question.  I was mulling over ordering a dessert, but after my boyfriend declined, he snatched our menus and walked away anyway.

I wasn't aware that the menu changed until a while after because I didn't have the chance to go.  As a small celebration (and my craving for pesto chicken pizza) my bf and I decided to go (last month?).  To say I was upset doesn't come close...I can't help that I love food! Miso Salad with Chicken --Gone.  This was my favorite salad and I always ordered it as a starter (shared between me and my bf).. I was sad to see it not on the menu.  The closest I could get to it was the Thai crunch salad which I found too sweet for my liking.  It just wasn't the same. Pesto Chicken Pizza--This was the one that made me really sad to see gone.  First my salad now this.  This was by far my favorite FAVORITE pizza and I'm still sad to see it gone.  I just couldn't believe it  and nothing on the menu came close.  I thought that I'd go ahead and order my second favorite .. Four Seasons Pizza--Gone!!!  I went to order this and saw that it was also gone!!!

They need to find out why it's so cold and uncomfortable -- especially toward the back of the restaurant -- where they have a tendency to seat you first.  If they could fix the temperature, it would improve the ambience significantly and make this CPK as good, if not better, than most.   If you do go, ask for a seat toward the front of the restaurant.  It's most comfortable there.  From what I've found, the best place to sit is at the bar.  They'll bring your food quickly plus a nice glass of wine.

Took my beau to the CPK at Fashion Island and instantly, I expected this location to up its game; I haven't been to many CPK's, but according to my boyfriend... they're all pretty nice! Atmosphere - check!  Wait was 10 minutes for lunch on a Sunday, which was really awesome since I was hungry. Once we sat, we ordered drinks right away, was served bread with olive oil and then ordered our food a few minutes after. Everything regarding service went very smoothly! The bread with the seasoned olive oil is amazing... I could pour/dip/sip everything all up in that goodness. For our mains, we went with the mushroom sausage pepperoni pizza and the jambalaya fettuccine to share. Each entree was about $14-15, prices I'd expect for this type of American restaurant chain. With the size of the pizza, it was a little disappointing, however, it tasted so good and so fresh, and the crust was so CHEWY, I soon forgot all qualms I had.  The jambalaya pasta is definitely something to order - spicy, jumbo juicy shrimps, andouille sausage and chunky pieces of ham. It's not as saucy, but it is coated with plenty of cajun spices and spicy oils. Once again, portion is slightly smaller than other restaurants (i.e. Cheesecake Factory) for about the same price, however, I enjoyed the quality of the dish. Overall, great experience!

When we sat down our server was extremely lacking in common care. We had to wait for water, bread, napkins. It was not what you expected from a place that 20 years ago was the gold standard in food service.  Oh well, that's the reason why Cheese Cake Factory and PF Chang's had hour waits while this place was zero wait. Sad, because when I'm down in Newport, we always go to all three places as most people do. I'm sure that this will be the last time I go to this location until a change is made to the team.

I politely told the waiter as I totally understand mistakes are made. He took my salad and said he would be right back.

I usually order an iced tea and he recommended a peach mango iced tea I told him I'm not a fruit person so he made me a cucumber lavender iced tea that was TO DIE FOR. Seriously such a cool guy and really cares about the customer. Carlos one of the servers is always there and serving my friends and I, he always has a smile on his face and always makes my experience there that much better.  All in all, I highly recommend going to the Newport Beach CPK the staff and food are 10/10!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newport-beach,2.96,2.98,2.98,,2.972
47,Debbi B.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,12,,1.0,2017-10-29,Service was really slow. We had to ask for everything multiple times. Food was so-so. Both Bathrooms were dirty and out of paper.

My favorite was the burger they now have, Wow, it's a must try if you have not. Also the chicken tequila pasta!  ** I will note there was a horrible customer sitting next to me that was so awful to the staff and management. Which I can see just left a message today, named Virtuall R. Some people are just so rude and have no respect. So props to the staff, Hector, and manager Roger for handling the situation professionally.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newport-beach,2.8,2.94,2.94,,2.884

35,Stella g.,"Redondo Beach, CA",26,30,123.0,1.0,2017-11-12,"Usually our experience here is pretty good, but tonight was an awful experience in every way possible. And just because you have employees call in sick, or no show does not mean you cannot be a good server, or have some common sense of what you are doing.....The service sucked, the food was awful and a cheese pizza should not be hard to make.......yet the kids cheese pizza seem to be a challenge for CPK tonight. A kids cheese pizza had no cheese (very wired, since it's just cheese) and it took forever to get drinks, and bread was also a challenge. The medium pizza was awful too, but the kids mac and cheese was the ONLY item that was cooked well and tasted halfway decent. Just a mess of an evening at CPK......And by the way, there was three other tables that complained, and a group of young adults/teens that walked out, so that shows how many people were unhappy. Just because employees call in sick does not mean the service should go to shit....but that was their excuse the whole time. What a waste of an evening.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newport-beach,2.48,2.89,2.89,,2.726
20,Hashanah555 K.,"Newport Beach, CA",64,281,572.0,4.0,2017-12-06,"5 stars for my server Rommel. I was undecided between 2 soups and he said he could bring me a sample of one. - The barley / smashed pea wasn't that great (it had an undesirable earthiness) - So I opted for the tortilla soup and it was outstanding! They have a lunch duo special soup n salad, that you can then upgrade the soup to a bowl for +$2. - If you ask for extra red onions there is a charge, oh well. The petite wedge salad was outstanding. The thick bacon was mighty tasty. The blue cheese dressing was a little strong, but maybe I will get this again but with a diff dressing. Their sourdough bread and butter is consistently great! Place is pretty clean, except I had to brush away a few bread crumbs (still cleaner than SBUX). I think I like this NPB location the best, out of all their chain locations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newport-beach,2.52,2.91,2.91,,2.7540000000000004
41,Linda A.,"La Verne, CA",0,19,1.0,1.0,2017-12-07,"This is the worst place I have ate in a long time. It is a special area. But, we chose the wrong place to eat. My daughter ordered a beer and twice the waiter came back and said they were out of it. Then we ordered a hamburger and appetizers. We had to ask for the courtesy bread which was still in the oven after 10 minutes. After 15 minutes the waiter came back and said they were out of hamburger patties. Someone forgot to take them out of the freezer in the morning. On my salad wedge I asked for ranch dressing rather than blue cheese and was told no problem. But of course I got blue cheese. The only thing that wasn't messed up was the spinach mushroom flatbread. The waiter came back and said they were taking $3.00 off of our bill for the inconvenience. When the check came he looked at it and said it doesn't show the discount but he saw it on his screen. REALLY???? We can do the math. Idiot, no discount!!!! Never again will we eat at any California Pizza Kitchen!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newport-beach?start=20,2.48,2.87,2.87,,2.7140000000000004
21,Ross D.,"Los Angeles, CA",48,42,4.0,2.0,2017-12-08,"Went on our ""Date Night"" and sat at the bar.   Watched pizzas getting cooked in the oven.  We ordered two pizzas.   One came out right and the other was completely wrong.  Waiter admitted that he ""rang it in wrong and would take care of it.""    We wondered what he meant by ""take care of it.""   Does that mean he would comp the pizza as it was his mistake?   Hmm we would have to wait and see.    So I started in on my pizza.  I had about half before I stopped eating. The corrected  pizza had yet to come out and I didn't want to finish my meal before the other one came out.  In that time, we saw multiple pepperoni pizzas go In and come out of the oven.  Surely one of them was going to be ours. Nope.   Meanwhile, my other half of the pizza got cold.   Eventually, our other pizza came out Nice and hot.     We finished our meal without any other hiccups.   Same waiter cleared our table and brought the bill with no further apology or discussion.  Like it never happened and the bill reflected that too.  Still trying to figure out what the waiter meant by ""take care of it.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newport-beach,2.52,2.86,2.86,,2.724

Came here with my boyfriend and experienced the worst customer service from the hostess, Delaney. Instead of being greeted by her, we were greeted by four of her friends. She did not want to help us as if we were interrupting her conversation. Once seated our drink order was taken by the manager and she walked back with some utensils that she proceeded to throw on the table. By far the worst service I've ever received, will not be returning to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-newport-beach,2.64,2.84,2.84,,2.7600000000000002

Little does she know, Ashley has incredible resolve and is willing to wait for the golden sticky goodness. It takes millenia for her to return, and the waitress refuses to split the check, claiming CPK is too busy, but its a ghost town other than us, leaving us to do multivariable calculus and use multiple algorithms to figure out how to pay. incredibly frustrated and disappointed. yours truly, CPKlover23.
