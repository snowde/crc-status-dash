Please have some courtesy and let us know or call us in advance before we have to call you first, at least I can make arrangements to pick up food elsewhere. You would think cpk would care about an order worth couple of hundred dollars but I guess they didn't because the delivery girl told us that they totally forgot about our order until 30minutes after 6pm.

16,Bryan L.,"Johns Creek, GA",92,158,126.0,3.0,2014-05-19,"TL;DR: Atmosphere was very cozy with the gas-fired oven, and most of the pizzas I tasted were dry and lacked flavor. The original BBQ chicken pizza was the exception, and was really tasty and surely recommend it. When you first walk in, you notice the dimly lit room and the gas-fire oven in the back. It's a really cozy atmosphere, and seems perfect for a dinner date with your significant other. I was with a group, so they set up 3 tables just for us. The restaurant felt like a suspended sunset, and most of the decor and lampshades were warm colors and felt very intimate. The attire felt semi-formal: it was kind of casual but then again it's higher than fast food restaurants. You have to remember that CPK is a chain restaurant, but sometimes it doesn't feel like one.  Customer service was good and didn't find any complaints. We went on a Monday evening so it wasn't very busy and the waitresses arrived about 3 minutes after I sat down. They help recommend a few items from the menu and were very courteous.  Most of the pizzas on the menu ranged from $10-$15, while the appetizers were under $10. One pizza can easily serve two individuals, but I would recommend buying two different ones to share with. They also offer tacos, pastas and other side dishes, but I only ordered pizza. CPK offers complementary bread after you order, which I believe was sourdough bread which you can dip in olive oil and herbs.  I've tried the following: Original BBQ Chicken Pizza (hand tossed) - chicken, red onion, cilantro, bbq sauce Sicilian Pizza (thin crust) - salami, Italian sausage, parmesan, oregano, gouda  California Club Pizza (hand tossed) - arugala, basil, romaine, avocado, mozzarella, tomatoes, bacon (Complementary bread) The BBQ chicken pizza was by far the best that I tried. It was a mid-sized pizza, divided into six slices, and it would've been enough for me. The chicken surprisingly was juicy, and the bbq sauce compliments the pizza really well. I was doubtful at first about the bbq sauce + pizza combo, but somehow it worked. The bbq sauce had a sweet, tangy note, and was a pleasure to eat. The red onions on the pizza paired nicely with the chicken. It also was a bit sweet, and gave you a bit of a kick when you bit into the pizza. The cilantro brought everything together, giving the pizza a fresh flavor and didn't make me want to hit the gym afterwards. The crust however was pretty dry, but I didn't expect much about that. Overall the pizza was really nice, and I recommend getting it if you do come here. I think this was the pizza that got them famous, and it still is a must-have on the menu.  The other two pizzas, however, were disappointing. I was expecting a lot from the Sicilian pizza, but it was really dry. I liked the sliced salami and the ham, which were nice compliments to the pizza. The sausage tasted something from a fast-food pizza joint like Dominos, and I have no clue why they added it on. The pizza though was really bland and couldn't taste much.  The California Club pizza was worse. I don't have anything against eating healthy, but if you're going to a pizza restaurant, don't expect to enjoy a healthy pizza, because you ain't gonna' son. The California Club in simplest terms was a salad atop a pizza. The greens even had salad dressing, and my friend ate it with a fork like with a salad. The elements were not cohesive, and it was a fail attempt of a pizza. I could see it working, but each ingredient had a mind of its own. The avocado were in slices and had its own creamy note, the bacon was salty and dry, while the salad...had no flavor. Even when you pick up the pizza, all the greens atop just fall off and you're just left with a dry, salty bacon pizza. It was more like a Cali Clash than a Cali Club. Please don't try to order ""healthy"" items off menus. The bread I heard was hard and dry. I didn't try it, but everyone around me did. I know that I'm using  the word ""dry"" a lot, but they actually were. This restaurant got a lot of bad reviews, but it was okay. It's a chain restaurant anyways, and I didn't really expect much from it. There are better restaurants out there and I recommend going to a local restaurant than this for a date/event.

98,Bryan L.,"Johns Creek, United States",92,158,126.0,3.0,2014-05-19,"TL;DR: Atmosphere was very cozy with the gas-fired oven, and most of the pizzas I tasted were dry and lacked flavor. The original BBQ chicken pizza was the exception, and was really tasty and surely recommend it. When you first walk in, you notice the dimly lit room and the gas-fire oven in the back. It's a really cozy atmosphere, and seems perfect for a dinner date with your significant other. I was with a group, so they set up 3 tables just for us. The restaurant felt like a suspended sunset, and most of the decor and lampshades were warm colors and felt very intimate. The attire felt semi-formal: it was kind of casual but then again it's higher than fast food restaurants. You have to remember that CPK is a chain restaurant, but sometimes it doesn't feel like one.  Customer service was good and didn't find any complaints. We went on a Monday evening so it wasn't very busy and the waitresses arrived about 3 minutes after I sat down. They help recommend a few items from the menu and were very courteous.  Most of the pizzas on the menu ranged from $10-$15, while the appetizers were under $10. One pizza can easily serve two individuals, but I would recommend buying two different ones to share with. They also offer tacos, pastas and other side dishes, but I only ordered pizza. CPK offers complementary bread after you order, which I believe was sourdough bread which you can dip in olive oil and herbs.  I've tried the following: Original BBQ Chicken Pizza (hand tossed) - chicken, red onion, cilantro, bbq sauce Sicilian Pizza (thin crust) - salami, Italian sausage, parmesan, oregano, gouda  California Club Pizza (hand tossed) - arugala, basil, romaine, avocado, mozzarella, tomatoes, bacon (Complementary bread) The BBQ chicken pizza was by far the best that I tried. It was a mid-sized pizza, divided into six slices, and it would've been enough for me. The chicken surprisingly was juicy, and the bbq sauce compliments the pizza really well. I was doubtful at first about the bbq sauce + pizza combo, but somehow it worked. The bbq sauce had a sweet, tangy note, and was a pleasure to eat. The red onions on the pizza paired nicely with the chicken. It also was a bit sweet, and gave you a bit of a kick when you bit into the pizza. The cilantro brought everything together, giving the pizza a fresh flavor and didn't make me want to hit the gym afterwards. The crust however was pretty dry, but I didn't expect much about that. Overall the pizza was really nice, and I recommend getting it if you do come here. I think this was the pizza that got them famous, and it still is a must-have on the menu.  The other two pizzas, however, were disappointing. I was expecting a lot from the Sicilian pizza, but it was really dry. I liked the sliced salami and the ham, which were nice compliments to the pizza. The sausage tasted something from a fast-food pizza joint like Dominos, and I have no clue why they added it on. The pizza though was really bland and couldn't taste much.  The California Club pizza was worse. I don't have anything against eating healthy, but if you're going to a pizza restaurant, don't expect to enjoy a healthy pizza, because you ain't gonna' son.

Please have some courtesy and let us know or call us in advance before we have to call you first, at least I can make arrangements to pick up food elsewhere.

21,David P.,"Norcross, GA",23,34,,5.0,2015-06-19,"I've had CPK in a few other locations, including some of the sketchy soggy pizza airport locations, but this one has been rather awesome. The food is chain restaurant quality plus one, meaning it's better fare than a lot of other chain places, and super consistent. I've never had to send back anything, ever. The only issue is the bread is sometimes hard, but it's also french bread and you can usually bring it up to them and they'll do something to make it right. The entire wait staff is a dream, they're punctuational, and invested. The management is nice. The to-go window is always staffed and online orders are punctuational and work well. I've been happy with every visit and plan on returning often, it's sort of my local go to place, with service and food that's actually quite better than J Alex next door to it.

63,David P.,"Norcross, United States",23,34,,5.0,2015-06-19,"I've had CPK in a few other locations, including some of the sketchy soggy pizza airport locations, but this one has been rather awesome. The food is chain restaurant quality plus one, meaning it's better fare than a lot of other chain places, and super consistent. I've never had to send back anything, ever. The only issue is the bread is sometimes hard, but it's also french bread and you can usually bring it up to them and they'll do something to make it right. The entire wait staff is a dream, they're punctuational, and invested. The management is nice. The to-go window is always staffed and online orders are punctuational and work well. I've been happy with every visit and plan on returning often, it's sort of my local go to place, with service and food that's actually quite better than J Alex next door to it.

I'm not sure if they changed the peanut sauce or what has changed about this pizza but it was NOT as flavorful as I remember. Maybe because they were very chintzy with the sauce so that it was a tad on the dry side and more chicken could have been on it for that price point.  All in all, I ate the pizza because I was about to eat my left foot, I was so hungry. Will I go back? Probably not....or not the one at the Forum.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norcross,3.96,3.21,3.21,,3.5100000000000002

84,Jim R.,"Atlanta, United States",1,13,2.0,3.0,2017-11-26,"The food is always good here. I recommend the Thai Crunchy salad and the pizza. We usually get great service at the Peachtree Corners restaurant but this visit was below average. There were several waitstaff standing at a table in the corner but our server was cutting fruit for the bar while our salads sat at the counter. Someone who appeared to be a manager followed our server around behind the counter yapping in his ear. I never saw her do anything productive. The bread wasn't ready so we didn't get it until we were done eating. We were full and didn't take it. We arrived at 11:20 and the bread for all tables wasn't ready until 11:50. This could have all been prepared ahead of opening. I'll be back, just a bad day.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norcross,3.48,3.22,3.22,,3.3240000000000007

6,Pooja P.,"Atlanta, GA",0,7,,3.0,2017-12-05,"I went here with 8 friends for my birthday dinner recently. I ordered the pepperoni and mushroom pizza which was tasty, yet I feel like the kitchen staff does not put enough meat on the pizza. The prices are already around $15 for one pizza so I was expecting a good sized portion of meat on the pizza yet the staff was very cheap with how much meat they chose to put on the pizza so I was not getting my money's worth. Other than that, the waiter was friendly yet he got annoyed that my friends had to ask for three rounds of water refills. The service is adequate and luckily the wait time was only two minutes on a Saturday night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norcross,3.36,3.21,3.21,,3.27
1,Jason R.,"Peachtree Corners, GA",13,27,,2.0,2017-12-18,"There seems to be an unspoken competition at the Forum restaurants as to which can be the worst in customer service.   Mambo Italiano has basically driven everyone in the neighborhood out years ago (how do they stay in business??), Ted's doesn't bother to even seat you anymore (bravo...), but CPK is racing up the line to become the most frustrating. We used to LOVE CPK.  We enjoy the food very much, and come in to get some of our 'regular' favorites.   The last few visits, though, have soured us on repeat visits altogether.     To say the staff is inattentive would be putting it mildly.   We come in, get seated (hey! CPK's already wayyyy ahead of Ted's Montana Grill at the Forum by this standard -- kudos!).   But then, we just sit...and sit...and sit...watching while 6-7 wait staff at CPK walk around.  No one stops by our table, but half huddle by a table in a corner (presumably on break..OK) while another few proceed to walk by the table again.  And again.    Finally, after 15 minutes someone (Martino, I believe, by our check after the meal finally made it to completion an hour or so later) stopped by for our drink order.   Another 10 minutes in and we got the drinks, but after dropping them off our server Martino immediately walks off.    It's another 15 minutes before he stops back by to take our order...so we'd been there **40 Minutes** by that time (we were ready to order when he stopped by to take our drink order but he left before we could even give it....). Starving by that point, we luckily got some bread with olive oil.  By that point, we were so hungry that bread  .   By the time we finally got our food order in, things seemed to be back on track.  Our trusty server Martino, was typically nowhere to be seen.    But, honestly, by the time we got the food ...it was good.   We have no problem with the food at all...but the service...Jeeeeeesh.  CPK managers, we're not difficult customers.  We're not expecting a 5-star dining experience but please, PLEASE, ask the too-cool-for-school staff to at least TRY to care.     The apathy is pretty evident.   40 minutes for a food order is juuuuuuuuust a bit much.      It's really a shame because this trend is only in the last year.  Prior years we always had a great experience -- with friendly staff and great food.   I don't think having someone stop by and take orders in a bit more timely manner is out of the norm.   Maybe we just came at a poor time (late afternoon), but it's been a similar trend on all recent visits this year (we had been stopping by once a week or every two weeks for some time).    With the non-existent service, it's a Hard Pass on CPK from this point forward.   The area is surrounded by restaurants. There's no reason to sit and wait (and wait) when you're going out to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norcross,3.28,3.19,3.19,,3.226
