86,Alison M.,"Virginia Beach, VA",223,1111,3477.0,5.0,2012-01-28,"Have been here once before a long time ago and got the BLT pizza - which I thought was good.   Stopped here today with my husband while shopping at the mall and we LOVED everything.   We got the avocado chicken spring rolls as our starter and they were delicious.  Warm and fresh and fantastic with a ranch sauce and a spicy ranch for dipping. I got the half BBQ chicken salad and my husband got some carnitas tacos.  I tried his and they were delicious.  My salad was very good, my only complaint that the chicken was cold - I prefer mine to be warm on salads - but I suppose some places do it differently.  We finished with the butter cake with vanilla ice cream for dessert.  Our waitress convinced us to try it - I was more leaning toward the brownie sundae.  I'm glad we listened to her - that butter cake was amazing.  It was warm and gooey and covered with some crunchy sugar coating or something.  Sooo good.  I usually don't eat much dessert my husband eats about three fourths of it but I helped him eat almost half of it this time.  Throughout the whole ordeal we both commented on how fresh the ingredients were and how good everything was.   It was a pleasant experience and with one so close to home for us we'll be sure to visit the one in Virginia Beach next time we want to get out of the house for dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norfolk?start=20,3.3480000000000003,3.3480000000000003,3.3480000000000003,3.3480000000000003,3.3480000000000003

Even with both of those things going on, we only wait about 30 minutes and with the mix of the two crowds, got some great people watching in. They handled the crowds with the smooth efficiency of G men, even down to the ear pieces to communicate impending vacancies at table 29.  CPK is CPK, it's all standardized, well made and focus grouped. I do like that they have a menu with all of the nutritional info on it. They also have healthy and vegan-y option, so it's good for crowds of diverse people.  We started with the baja chicken eggrolls and they were pretty good. They dressed them with fresh cilantro, which was a nice touch. They had a bit of spice, but not much.  I had the roasted veggie salad with salmon. I was surprised that the salmon came out chunked into the salad and not as a filet on top, but they, that's smart! They could have just charged me $5 for 2 ounces of salmon, how would I know?!  My husband had the thin crust meat lovers thing and it suited him pretty well. It was a good size and he had a couple slices to take home with him. I had a bite and thought it was pretty good.

The kids shared cheese pizza and I had the Pear and gorgonzola pizza that has a mixed salad on top. It was very nice but I didn't give it more stars because I love crunchy pizza and it was more like a warm flatbread or pita. I make pizza at home all the time and I MAKE sure it's thin and crunchy.

Third, they offer a VERY diverse menu that will appease the vegetarians, the weight conscious and the people that just wont to stuff themselves with Pizza.   On to the food, if you're a salad person, there's a good chance that the half-salad will do ya.  They offer a wide varieties of options.  Next, of course, is the pizza, they offer a selection of ""Fancy Schmancy"" pizza options.  Don't come here expecting a big hot steaming pile of cheese and sauce.  This isn't a bad thing, I like occasionally having a big BLT pizza or a White pizza with bacon!  Yum. For the appetizers, I really like their lettuce wraps!  Avoid the fish tacos, they use the wrong lettuce on it and it just comes out REALLY bad.  Trust me.

It's me, not them. I acknowledge that. I tend to like more causal dining experiences, and while I wouldn't say that this is a formal place, it's not as casual as I like it. The pizza is ok, I have not tried anything that I would write home about. My wife loves it, and they have a nice selection of beer, which is why it is a three star rating instead of a two star rating. The service has always been fine, our waitress this time wasn't bad, but wasn't great. She knew a lot about beer, which is a plus for me, but she didn't wow us. Overall, it's solid if you are looking for a nice dining experience, maybe a first date type situation. Also, probably not the best place if you have young kids. It's more quiet than most restaurants, and if your kids are loud and destructive (like mine), then it just wouldn't work out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norfolk?start=60,3.48,3.48,3.48,3.532,3.4800000000000004

93,Mark D.,"Pacific Beach, San Diego, CA",222,428,155.0,4.0,2014-07-17,"Wonderful decor, friendly staff and great tasting gourmet pizza's are the constants at CPK. That said there are a few hiccups that have me debating whether it's a 3 Star or a 4 Star restaurant.  Service: We had an excellent server this time coupled with the no waiting for a table, which is usually 50/50 depending on how crowded it is at MacArthur Mall. Appetizers: I ordered the White Corn Guacamole and Chips as a starter and found the chips a little stale (which is a pet peeve of mine). The Guacamole could've used a little salt during its preparation, as it would've really helped bring out the flavors of the corn and avocado.   My wife had a better experience with the Petite Wedge Salad, which was a perfect size. I always felt wedge salads were a little on the large size for an appetizer but CPK seemed to get it right. The fresh bacon bits verses artificial really made a difference in flavor. However the sliced tomato cubes were to small for using a fork so you only could get any of their flavor when the cuts were caught up in the dressing. Other than the size of the salad it wasn't any different from any other wedge salad you'd find at any national chain restaurant. Meal: For dinner I ordered the Five Cheese and Tomato Pizza while my wife choose her favorite, The Original BBQ Chicken Pizza. Both were so dang good I'd have a hard time not ordering them on our next time back.  Wine Flights: I really enjoyed this addition, as I don't remember it on our last visit. The pours were good sized; the glasses spotless and choices pretty good. We tried the Adventure (or something like that) and it was great for our meal. Desert: We decided on the Butter Cake and found it quite delicious but could've used a few more minutes in room temperature before taking it from the frig to the table. Cleanliness: Overall this place is really clean. The tables, floor, restrooms and the kitchen prep area looked good (the prep area is open to the public in case you haven't been there). Overall: What CPK does well it does very well but what they miss on would only takes a few tweaks to get it up to the same par as the gourmet pizza's and our server. Although I thought I'd be having a 3 Star dinner when I walked in after taking everything into consideration I'm going with the 4 Star on this visit and update on my next time around as need be.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norfolk?start=40,3.64,3.64,3.64,3.6,3.6400000000000006

My last visit I went with a larger group of 6. We were situated back to back, and I mean chairs touching, between other four tops. There was so little room to move.

So needless to say while we only had 2 bites of salad, here comes our pizza.  Honestly the pizza was cold and only half of it had chicken on it (the entire pizza is supposed to have chicken and bacon on the bottom) This pizza comes with arugula, but the amount of arugula was a bit much. All in all it was edible. I should've stuck my normal pasta dishes, but I was in the mood for pizza.  Now, the butter cake is ALWAYSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS spectacular.

However, I was thrilled to see long time manager Michael is still in charge and keeps his customers happy. The front area was clean and I also found the restrooms to be clean on my visit. I stopped in for a late weekday lunch with my daughter and was promptly waited on by the hostess and led to our table by one of the runners. Our waitress Abbie promptly got drinks and bread going and was strong the entire time. Drinks and bread delivered in a timely manner. A missed opportunity to not ask for butter for the bread which my daughter needed. However, Abby got it taken care of quickly. Another missed opportunity was to clear the table of dishes during our service. My daughter got the kids peperoni pizza which was delicious and give enough to take a few slices home. I got my usual fish tacos with side of chips and salsa. It is a very filling and scrumptious as usual. Service remained very good, but my water did hit the danger zone of almost empty and I did have to ask for a refill. I also wanted to take the time to comment on the dining room. I did not see a single table that was not occupied not cleared off. The floors were clear of debris as well. Everything presented in a professional manner and I was impressed. The restaurant manger Michael came over and asked us how our food was. I was happy to share with him that it was excellent and that his server did a great job, but did discuss some missed opportunities. He discussed a new valet program to park on Monticello Ave. and then get a stub from a server to provide the valet service. Don't forget to tip them, they don't work for FREE!

We decided on CPK because we both loved it when we lived in Massachusetts. However, the food was terrible. Our pita and hummus appetizer was gross; the hummus was watery and the pita bread wasn't actual pita bread imo. The Thai Chicken pizza was undercooked and disgusting; I couldn't even stomach half a slice. The mac n cheese bites? Burnt and oily. I started to quietly complain to my boyfriend about it, since we're both rather shy and didn't want to cause any kind of trouble. But a waitress overheard me and sent the manager, I believe his name was either Evan or Nick, over to our table. He offered to have our mac n cheese bites remade, but took almost 30 minutes to do so. Our waitress came by and asked why we were still here, since we had already paid. We told her we were waiting on the manager. She went to get him, but it took 15 more minutes for him to come back. At this point, we were both furious and still very hungry. When he came back, we explained all the things wrong with our entire visit, to which he responded with a coupon for a free small dish. We didn't really want it. I wanted my money back and asked for it. He ended up giving us a $15 gift card, the free small dish coupon, and my money back. We shook his hand and left. Fast forward two days and we're hungry again after work. We decide, hey, let's go back since it's on them this time. Totally. Different. Experience. It was amazing! The manager periodically checked up on us and we ended up having such an amazing time. This time around we got a pepperoni pizza, the dumplings (BEST. THING. EVER!!!!), and this chocolate cake dessert. We both loved it, and have such a nice conversation with the manager. Our waiter this time was the absolute best, too. Very punctual and always made sure we had what we needed. Apparently the first time we went, things had been happening like that quite often.

29,Kelly F.,"Chesapeake, VA",0,5,,1.0,2016-01-20,"This one was a doozie.  This restaurant doesn't even deserve one star.  I went with a couple people in December to CPK and we had a nice time, drinks were great and food was good, service also. So the next time we were in MacArthur to go to the movies, we decided to go there again, this time it was just me and my boyfriend. We were seated in the back, near the emergency exit door. We were having a nice time, our server Alen was AWESOME, he's a really nice person, food and drinks were exactly as ordered and came in good timing (I had been in the F&B industry for four years, so I know how it goes). Then it all came to a screeching hault. A very tall man walked up to our table and started asking us for ""anything that we had"". I seriously thought this was a joke, or a hidden camera thing, so I kind of blew it off, expecting this man to go away. But after being at the table for at least two minutes, I had just had enough. I walked up to a server's counter to wait another minute for someone to talk to. I looked around to see that other servers had noticed the man at the table, yet no one did ANYTHING! I looked back at the table to find this man sitting where I had been seated, eating my boyfriend's pizza.  I waited for someone to talk to, then someone went to ""find a manager"". It also blows my mind that on a Friday night, probably around 7:30, there was no manager on the floor, but hidden away in her back office. The manager came out and asked what was happening then walked to the table as the man was leaving. I sat back down and found an eaten pizza crust on my plate of food. My boyfriend said that he kept on badgering him to give him food and money, and when my boyfriend said that he had no money, he started getting angry. This is a very dangerous situation to let happen. The manager offered us a dessert when she was at the table, and we declined. Then our server came back with the check. It was a full check, laid out on the table. I was a little shocked, as I have handed out fully comped checks for things that happened that were not nearly this serious. We both stared at the check. Alen came back to the table and I asked to see the manager again. She didn't come to the table and after about 5 minutes I got up again to see if the manager was anywhere, but yet again, she was in the back, not on the floor. She came out, talked to a couple other servers and then came to talk to me. I asked her if the bill was serious, if she was really expecting us to pay the full amount after our dinner was ruined by poor management. She said she was working on comping the bill, but didn't have a new bill. She then printed out a bill that was only for the drinks, and I asked if that was for legal reasons, and she said yes. I understand that, but also know that drinks can be comped in situations like this. She then took the bill and said ""well you both said that you didn't want dessert and that you were fine"". I found that breath-taking, that she was now turning the problem around on us. My boyfriend then came up and said something, and then she said ""yes, you both should be my first priority,"" giving blame to herself over the fact that we had not been her first priority. She asked us that we just take care of our server, which we did in the form of a 33% tip, and we also took care of the man that begged us for food and money. We left the bill with her, handed Alen cash, and left. A hostess followed us out of the restaurant with movie passes, which was super cool.  But this situation was dangerous and ruined a night out, something that we usually don't do. We're all for helping people out, but on nights that we're treating ourselves, we don't want to be approached in a closed environment.  And on top of this, while at work on monday, my boyfriend was telling the story to his co-workers, and found out that the same man had approached someone else at the neighboring restaurant, Texas-De-Brazil. This is obviously a bigger problem that mall security has to deal with.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norfolk?start=60,3.84,3.84,3.84,2.5640000000000005,3.84

In fact, our server last night was exceptional. She was very pleasant, patient and upbeat.  Like I've said, my parents really like CPK so we do come here often.

It's garlicky, fresh, and delicious. I've had their jambalaya pasta in the past but when I had it, I felt as if their meat to pasta ratio was so unbalanced. But when I say I love pasta ... I mean it and it always bothers me whenever there's more meat than pasta. My family also ordered the shrimp and chicken lettuce wrap which you can't go wrong with.

She started with the strawberry mango cooler to drink.  We both really were impressed with how tasty and refreshing it was.  It is made with Fresca which if you don't know is a zero calorie beverage so it's not as unhealthy and sugary as some specialty drinks.  At $3 we were pleased.  Sign up for their email and get a coupon for free shall plate. We got the fried mac-n-cheese. Wife loved them but I want too impressed.  I thought they were a little greasy and bland.  We then got club and avocado egg rolls. These tasted great but 3 egg rolls for a little over $10 seems steep.  We shared the California club pizza and it was fantastic.  Crust was really awesome. Topped with arugula and romaine, tomatoes,  and avocado dressed with a lemony dressing. Let me tell you....the bacon they use,  Nueske's (or something like that) is really a game changer.  It is so good.  This bacon is not grocery store bacon....go online and search...you're talking $12-$15 a pound.  That is really great ingredients for a casual place.  We used our Amex Points for a gift card so was free...and that made it really on point.  4 star for me. ..wife would say 5.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norfolk,3.48,3.48,3.48,,3.4800000000000004

Was not satisfied at all with the customer service I received tonight. When we walked up to the take out area we were not greeted until the worker finished her personal conversation with her coworkers.  While taking my order she proceeded to laugh and joke with the people around her.  8 minutes later I get my salad and she informed me that she made a mistake. I ordered a full BBQ chicken salad and she only charged me for a half. She explained to me that she could get in trouble for what she was about to do but offered me another half salad to make it a whole. I explained to her that I would just take what I paid for and didn't want her to get in  any  trouble.

My little ones ordered their cheese only pizzas and surprisingly one child ate the entire thing.  Ahem he is 4!!!! The other child complimented the pizza and she liked the crust.  She may not have eaten the whole thing because it's a girl thing.     My teen ordered a chicken club with a Mediterranean salad.  She liked all of it and helped her sister with her pizza and 2 slices of mine.  If your in search of how to reduce food waste come see me.  I order the spinach and mushroom pizza with potatoe soup.  I was just going to stick with a traditional pepperoni but my waitress convinced me if I liked spinach it was a good choice. I'm glad I tried it.  It was good.  I can get pepperoni anywhere anytime!    We had a great seat in the back in a booth next to the door to the patio.  It was a late lunch around 2 but there were probably about 10 tables filled.  Our server was nice and direct.  I tried to joke with her but she didn't really joke back.  She filled our drinks and check on us.  Restaurant was clean as was the restrooms.  Plenty of seating to include a bar area, booths and tables.  Takeout service is available too.   We would go back to sample something else.  The food was good, hot and fresh.  We also missed out on dessert so I guess that's a definite yes we will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-norfolk,3.08,3.53,3.53,,3.35

The answer should have been, let me check for you. So with that being said, I asked to speak with the manger and of course he stated, ""sure, were can do that for you"".
