251,Beth E.,"Northridge, CA",0,7,,4.0,2012-01-08,"Nice service here. Food is good..  I always call ahead and put my name in before I get there. When I arrive, they usually seat me right away or within a couple mins. I have never had a problem with this restaurant and would recommend the sicilian pizza here.   The only thing I don't like is the bread they serve you as you wait. They used to serve much better bread. The new CPK in Topanga mall serves much better bread and oil with your bread.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northridge?start=280,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.216,3.0000000000000004

So they have a thing called ""Breakfast with the Easter Bunny"" and like all the smart businesses they know what to say to get you IN all while they leave out those important little facts, those facts that once again I DIDN'T ask for like an idiot that I am. Ok so I get there and the hostess that morning was all smiles and TRIED to accomodate my party and I as best she could which is something that every customer likes. Bla bla bla we sit down and I'm looking for the bunny when I finally see IT I was so damn dissapointed. (no offense to the elderly)  FUCCEN BUNNY WAS WELL IN TO HIS/HER 50'S!! I mean hunching and with that slow walk you know the one the older people have (again no offense to the elderly) But give me a fuccen break CPK!!! OR THE MALL or whomever booked the bunny person! I seriously began to wonder exactly how the whole thing was gonna work. Anyway the bunny was walking around and they would take a picture THEN give you a stupid little card with instructions on how you can order the prints! FML!!! why would I ever think they would actually give you the damn picture?? NOTHING IS FREE!! and I know that but I wanted to thing positive. OK so our server was really nice she was more than nice she was great! ( : the ""fruit bowl"" was BS! but the pizzas were pretty good. They don't have jalapenos which sucks! but the have Chalula or whatever the hell that was which gave it a little kick enough to get me to eat one whole pizza by myself plus 4 fruit bowls! DON'T JUDGE ME! Point is it was only $8 per person and it included the drink plus the pizza and a fruit bowl. They had about 6 pizza choices which wasn't bad at all. I'm NOT a pizza fan and I'm def not a CPK fanatic but I wouldn't say it's horrible. I had a good experience here and therefore I wouldn't mind going back.

107,Alekkz H.,"Seattle, WA",507,559,1042.0,4.0,2012-04-07,"2nd time coming to CPK!~ The first time I was actually really excited because before I moved to California, I used to buy frozen pizzas that were called CPK only because it was BBQ Chicken!!  Even if it was frozen pizza... it tasted good~ So when I found out about this place, I was like ""OMGSH! It's the real place"" of course that sounds silly.. My first time experience wasn't that great because I think I got sick ... after eating the Chicken Piccata... since it was super oily... Well this review is about my 2nd time experience so here goes! My sister (who is visiting from Washington) and I went inside and were asked our names but the hostess didn't tell us how long it would be... We waited about 5 minutes... (the thing I don't understand is when they have open tables in front of us and no one gets seated there) No need to rush, so I just took in the interior of the place and so far I do like the inside but... only problem is... the low ceiling makes people talking really NOISY... Our server was nice and asked us what we would like to drink and if we wanted any appetizers. Usually when I go to a restaurant the lemonade flavors are strawberry or raspberry but CPK had peach and mango lemonade which threw me off! I asked our server which one tasted better and she suggested the peach lemonade so I gave it a try. Not really better than the raspberry lemonade but I did end up getting a refill :) The actual reason we came here was because last time I came, someone in the group ordered Crispy Mac N' Cheese and I only had a bite of it last time. We ordered it of course and it tasted good :)  Next, I ordered the Pesto Cream Penne with Shrimp minus the Sun-Dried Tomatoes. (I don't like tomatoes) My sister ordered the Four-Cheese Ravioli  (which I actually wanted first... because Ravioli is my favorite!!) Both came out on a decent time and we digged in. I tried the Four-Cheese Ravioli first and my sister tried the Pesto Cream Penne first! We both fell in love with each other's dishes so we switched. I ended up gobblin' up all the ravioli and my sister ate a decent amount of the penne... (except she had penne pasta 3 times this past week...) Our server came around a couple times asking if everything tasted alright and she left with a funny look on her face, probably because we switched our dishes haha. I definately want to come back and eat the Four-Cheese Ravioli again because I even loved the cheesy color of it on top plus the texture of Ricotta is... the best~ I would give it 5 stars... but the noise level.. kind of ruins everything.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northridge?start=100,3.04,3.04,3.04,3.184,3.0400000000000005
278,Chloé C.,"Los Angeles, CA",174,217,262.0,3.0,2012-05-06,"Honestly, why does their bread have to be cold? It's a better restaurant than some of the choices at the Northridge mall, and it is popular. I'll be honest. I like the signature bbq chicken pizza. Margherita is good too. I enjoy the avocado spring rolls for an appetizer, as well as the red velvet cake. One of the best red velvet cakes out there, especially considering this is a popular chain restaurant and I've tried a lot of different red velvet cakes.

Food took too long after we placed the order. Blamed the kitchen being behind. No manager came by to acknowledge the slow delivery so we figured the server just forgot to order our food. Ordered the tortilla soup which was cold and tasted like mush, looked like baby food. Had a pepperoni pizza which was great. I would like to have had some Parmesan and hot pepper seeds. Couldn't get anyone's attention. Would have liked to have refills on our beverages. The server did ask if everything was satisfactory, we were more than half way through, so we said fine. Thanks for checking. The server did have the soup taken off the check but still no manager visit. Update: Assistant GM reached out and contacted us via email.

179,Sara K.,"Los Angeles, CA",42,37,22.0,4.0,2012-07-07,"This is mine and my sister's go to place when we just wanna have lunch. I'd say its really a toss up for good or bad service. I will say though, that the only time that we have been seated outside the service was definitely terrible. I understand that having guests outside might be a little tough, but seriously, we sat through the entire meal without having our waters refilled once, and the only time we saw our waitress was when she took our order, brought our food, and gave us our check. My advice for all you guys would be to sit inside, even if the wait is longer, it usually isn't as long as they say. It's totally worth it to sit inside! As for the food, I've tried just about everything on their menu. Like I said, its my go to place! My favorite is the chipotle pizza! it has chicken and this pico de gallo mixture on top of it, and it comes drizzled with cilantro and lime sauce that is soooo delicious! I ALWAYS ask for a side of that sauce! Other mentionable pizzas would have to be the habanero carnitas, tostada, and spinach artichoke pizza. They have a small cravings menu with is alright, but it is what it says, small. The chicken quesadilla, is pretty good, but for $5.00, you could just make it at home lol. The macaroni bites, and korean tacos are also pretty good!  As for drinks, the lemonades are usually on the sweet side, but good to have every now and then. The coladas are pretty good at this location, too! The only drink I'd advise against would be the cherry limeade, I was thoroughly disaapointed. I felt so bad because I kept asking the waiter to fix it, until I finally gave up after probably the 4 glass?  Anyways, if you've never been to CPK, you should definitely go! and try the chipotle pizza! (: just don't sit outside lol and if you are starving when you get there, just ask for bread while you wait. Apparently, they're not allowed to serve the free bread unless you ask for it, lame right?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northridge?start=200,3.32,3.32,3.32,3.024,3.3200000000000003
257,Brittainie B.,"San Francisco, CA",76,121,2.0,4.0,2012-07-13,"I like California Pizza kitchen. They have alot more drink options than alot of places- smoothies, coladas, lemonades, limeades, slushies, teas, coffees, wines. I've always been a big fan of drinks and i appreciate all their options as i feel like more places should have them. The first place i look on the menu is the beverage section, and if soda, water, and afew beesr or wines are the only options it sort of makes me a sad panda lol ^.^ their pizza is different but in a good california-home-BBQ way. This is my aunts favorite place to go in the area because they have really good and unique salads. The portions are always good. My aunt got a full BBQ chicken salad with avocados and garbanzo beans without tortilla chips *strange that you have to add garbanzos if you want them like avocado*, it's her favorite. i got a half carmelize peach salad with salmon and avocado. My grandmother got fetticini alfredo. Their alfredo is much lighter and less saucey but in a really good way. I only eat half of the half salad as the portions are pretty big. Salad was great. Peaches could be more carmelized as they were really just soggy but they still tasted great. My salad consisted of gorgonzola, cranberries, walnuts, arugala, spinach, and the avocado and crunchy-skinned salmon that i added. Great compliments to the salad and they had a nice portion of every ingrediant with a fresh lemon non-oily vinegrette which i appreciated. The food here is consistently good which is nice because alot of places are on and off in quality. Bread is ordinary and stale. Coffee and mango raspberry colada was great. Tiramisu for dessert was also lighter and really yummy ^.^ grandmother and aunt also had an apple crisp with icecream. My aunt always orders that i didn't try it but they liked it. I highly reccomend the place the staff was kind except the guy who seated us who seemed alittl too self loving and bro like. But everything was pretty good as it always is. I'm only in LA on my ocassionaly breaks so this place isn't on the top of my list. Wish we went someplace more LA-exotic as CPK is a chain all over and i'm not a big chain fan especially when it comes to resteraunts, but it's a good chain and i appreciate their accomodating menus.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northridge?start=280,3.4,3.4,3.4,2.9280000000000004,3.4000000000000004
261,S. K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,3.0,2012-08-15,"Went here today. The food was alright, but nothing to write home about. The server really made us feel awkward and rushed. She was polite but seemed kind of fake, and right as we were finishing our meal demanded that we pay our bill asap because she had to pickup her daughter from school. That is all fine and dandy but it was quite uncomfortable and I have not experienced that at a restaurant before. We were not even really lingering for a long time. So we pay, sign the checks and put down the tip and before we can gather our bags and get up she is already grabbing her tips and the credit card slips in front of us as fast as she can go. It is isnt like it is the most offensive thing in the world, but it was unnecessary. I am sure she could have left and gotten her tips another time. Anyway, CPK should just make sure all employees are acting professionally and creating a comfortable atmosphere.

Parking however, can be a little challenging cause it's located next to the mall and is always busy. Tip - have one of your family members or friends get a table while you look for a parking to save on wait time. All of their salads, pasta, and pizzas are delicious. I don't remember a time where I didn't like anything that I've ordered.  My favorite is the cajun jambalaya pasta, gorgonzola pear pizza and chicken Moroccan salad.

So, I chose something close to home. It has been a long while since I had pizza and I wanted to pick a classy place such as California Pizza Kitchen (CPK) at Northridge Fashion Center. Located at the north side of Northridge Fashion Center and near Macy's. CPK is elegantly designed. We decided to get a booth near the kitchen. My hostess was a cutie named, Megan. I used ""My"" versus ""Our"" because I had a liking of her from the start. We started off with our complimentary bread with olive oil & herbs. After devouring our complimentary bread, we ordered a quick appetizer of White Corn Guacamole & Chips ($3.99). Its a simple plate with tortilla chips with a scoop of guacamole. I wish there was more chips and more guacamole. After a quick bite, I ordered the main dish of the night. I was worked up through the day and decided none other than ""The Works"" Pizza ($13.99). ""The Works"" consists of mushrooms, pepperoni, sausage, onions, and heck a lot of green peppers. Its hand tossed and the bread was very thin. I ate more of the ingredients than the dough. Now, that's what a pizza should taste like. The meal wasn't greasy and Megan took care of our table. I made a mistake of asking for napkins, but as I mentioned it was not greasy nor it was messy. I ate four slices versus my mothers two slices. However, this meal is rewarding since I have been good in the past couple of years and its time to work harder for 2014. Yelp!

Entrees: BBQ chop salad. I still enjoy this salad and they did not skimp, this was an entree unto itself.  All the goodies are in there, just a touch heavy handed on the dressing.

I mean she did try adding on a bit but it wasn't obnoxious or anything.  I like that they offer curbside pick up. Personally, I wish I would've used this service because they had blocked off the majority of the lot in front of CPK to accommodate the Farmers Market. I completely understand why they did this but the Farmers Market wasn't happening until later and there weren't many people setting up yet. In short it was a hassle and waste of time having to deal with the people and the parking situation especially on a short lunch break, Food/Price I ordered their 10"" margarita pizza and added on some red onions for $13. The pizza was light and refreshing with a simple tomato sauce. I thought it was good but probably not worth the $13 price tag. I guess if I was sitting inside and enjoying with good company I could see $13 being reasonable. However, I am rating them on the food itself and lets just say it doesn't say too much. I also ordered a half Caesar salad for $7. The salad was good but nothing special nor unique and really not worth the $7 price tag. Why is a basic HALF salad $7 when I can get a much bigger and better anti pasta, with meat, for about that price at most Italian restaurant  Overall I guess it's an option but you can do better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northridge?start=80,3.72,3.72,3.72,3.34,3.7200000000000006

Im not sure what it was and if the cook was upset because we sent the food back.. We always order the pizza with extra extra sauce. Last time they brought it super DRY even after we said so and the server and manager agreed there was almost NO SAUCE. So they told us next time we come say EXTRA like 5 times. So we did. So this server said Okay I will MAKE SURE the cook knows, because we told her the last incident. When our food came out, it was the same as before and came out DRY with almost no sauce AGAIN! The server too was confused and promised us she said it to him about 4-5 times so she didn't understand why he wouldn't put more on. They tried to give us extra sauce in a dish to dip it in, but it doesn't taste the same, plus it wasn't even hot. After trying to just dip it, we thought it was ridiculous to pay for something that we didn't ask for and that wasn't even good! We go there every week and for 3 ppl we always get about 5 dishes! So we sent it back and besides the food coming out AFTER my sister and I were DONE with our food, and my son shared my pasta because he was starving, that by the time the pizza came out, he was full. But he wanted it so he ate a piece and we all tried it to see if it was right this time.

296,Beverly G.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,13,5.0,2.0,2015-05-10,"So my bf and I decided to do lunch here. Thought it'd be nice to do the outdoor seating. The hostess was friendly and sat us down quickly despite the Saturday rush.  Our waiter Brandon took our drink orders. I was indecisive and it looked as if it annoyed him. He said he'd come back later to get the orders, which I thought made sense. We did order our appetizer, which didn't take too long. Our meals however did take longer than expected. Considering that I had ordered the chicken ceaser salad I didn't expect for there to be a delay on that. We had to remind the server a few times about our order of bread and second round of drinks. At one point that same hostess from earlier  walked by our table and coughed without covering her mouth.  This is pretty gross considering my glass of iced water was on the table uncovered. We had asked our server what the hold up was on the food, he seemed confused about why we'd ask. I understand it may have been busy and he may have been overwhelmed,  but his service seemed lackluster. It seemed as if he was more attentive to the tables around us. I know what youre probably thinking, that we were loud, obnoxious, and picky patrons. If that was the case I would have found his service understandable.   However, my bf and I were completely understanding of the wait and shitty service. So after asking him about the food, it surprisingly  came out minutes later.  It was delicious. At least until hours later both my bf and I experienced abdominal pain and diarrhea. Don't know if this was a coincidence or not but truth be told, Im not happy about my recent experience with CPK.  They even took my favorite dish off the menu. This place was once a favorite, now its just overpriced mediocre food at best.  Don't know if it was an 'off' day for the server but he should've not stayed out too late the night before or not shown up to work at all!

THEN, 45 minutes later we finally got our food.  Our pizzas were cold as were put pastas. The manager came an apologized and brought out new pizzas.  Finally we get desserts and in my mom's strawberry shortcake's whip cream there was a green bean. When we told our waiter, Ken, he responded by saying that it was actually an asparagus not a green bean. And it's because the salad guy also makes desserts. Since we were unimpressed by this fun tidbit, we requested the check and left. This is really upsetting. We had multiple issues and our waiter was absolutely terrible. His apathetic attitude and service left vast amounts of room for improvement.  The manager was sympathetic but generally useless. He took the ruined items off our bill but did nothing to improve the standard of service.  We had 10 people in our party, most ranging ages 18-30 and no one was carded for alcoholic drinks.

94,Shelby H.,"Los Angeles, CA",520,18,4.0,5.0,2015-06-23,"Let me just start by saying... THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! My boyfriend & I always buy the BBQ Chicken Pizza from the frozen food section & it's actually really tasty, so the fresh baked version has to be better, right?!  When we walked in, I was really impressed with the restaurant itself. They have a very open layout, so you don't feel cluttered or crammed at all. Our server's name was Ken, & his service was impeccable! I have no idea how anyone can give him a bad review. I feel that people just find things to complain about.  Seriously, ask for him when you come in! He literally walked us through the entire menu & was  very honest about recommendations from the food to drinks! I ordered the California Crush drink, which was very tasty (& strong) & my better half ordered a beer! They do start out off with yummy bread with oil & herbs for dipping. It's hard to go wrong with that. When it came time to order our food, Ken recommended the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine for myself & the boyfriend ordered the BBQ Chicken Pizza with Bacon. Can I just say I love Italian food. It's my absolute favorite ever, but rarely does a dish really top my list. I HIGHLY recommend the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine. It is literally one of the best dishes I've ever had. I got it with extra sauce, like Ken suggested, & it was just absolutely delicious. The pizza was ridiculously amazing, as well.  We were going to finish off with Strawberry Shortcake, but Ken wouldn't let us lol. He insisted on trying the Buttercake. All I'm going to say is... holy moly. My mouth is salivating again! After our dinner, we were able to chat with Ken for a moment. We told him we were fairly new to the area & he literally wrote down the best restaurants to go to in the area! I was so appreciative of that, because it can definitely be overwhelming having 15 restaurants every couple blocks! All in all, it was a fabulous dinner. Go... ask for Ken... order the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine with a California Crush to drink... don't forget about the Buttercake... & you will have a fabulous experience!

Started with the chicken ginger dumplings for appetizers. Prepared a little differently it was quite delicious.  Main dish is the garlic cream fettuccine with shrimp. The dish was okay. Need more sauce IMO.  For whatever reason I never seem to have no room for desert. Maybe it's the bread we loaded up on before the food arrived. I'm sure they're quite good.

84,Scotty W.,"Northridge, CA",329,91,442.0,5.0,2015-07-26,"So was out with a good buddy of mine and we were trying to decide on just where to go eat dinner tonight. Some place low key after having a crazy celebratory weekend as well. And after driving by a couple of places that were either closed or looked too shady he suggested... hey you wanna go to CPK?!? I was like...uhh YA...you don't have to ask me twice about this place! Growing up in SoCal CPK is a staple of this area and if you don't know you better know by now that this place has upped its game as a franchise restaurant chain!  New more sophisticated look and atmosphere, new menu design,  new and more flavorful entrées along with some of the classics that we all know and love. Just a totally all around better experience for very reasonable prices that won't break the bank just because you want to eat out and have a nice sit down meal.  So from the outside of the restaurant it looked packed and I thought that we were going to have a long wait and maybe just eat at the bar. However as I went to park and my friend went in he texted me and said bar is opened but when I got in to my surprise he got us a table (sneaky bastard...lol). Inside the place was buzzing with a nice cool vibe and nicely lit. The noise level was moderate and not overbearing and this particular location was very big with outdoor seating to boot. We ordered after our waiter brought our waters and bread and gave us ample time to decide. And btw our waiter Tyler could not have been nicer,  more attentive and just all around more terrific of a service person than if you built one from scratch! He nailed our order and my buddy's lightly cooked BBQ pizza request came out perfect along with one of my favorite dishes here at CPK the jambalaya pasta. He was great...I liked that he was constantly asking how everything was and even the floor manager came out to check on our table. It was very pleasant and made us feel like they really wanted us to enjoy our food and the whole experience... which hello other restaurants is the whole reason we come to your establishment in the first place... to be made to feel special and cared for on top of getting a great meal. But I digress...lol.  To sum it all up... they knocked it out of the park tonight at this spot! 5 stars easy!

But I feel like a fatty if I eat a full meal of pasta with no meat.  OK so on to my complaints about this location.  I came here and ordered to go once. The guy told me it would take about 10-15 minutes. So I just waited instead of going into the mall to make a quick return. I ended up waiting almost 30 minutes !!!! That is ridiculous!

He had a great personality and we were happy with him, until he tells us that he's only helping Alex out and she'll ""be right with us"" -_-... She seemed rushed, bothered, and dis-organized. Barely came to our table. When I got the appetizer, I wanted the extra cheese on the side for it. She didn't come by so it was just sitting there until probably 10 minutes later or more when Tyler, reminded the runner who served us the bread that I wanted butter and extra cheese. He apologized, and we loved him but then that was the last of him. Alex took over and she was just so un-attentive. Our friends joined us a few minutes after us being there and she seemed annoyed.

My boyfriend never got his refill for his pepsi and every-time she said she was going to get it. She forgot.

(Especially Ashley who served us today) I went in with my boyfriend to have lunch and off the bat Ashley was there for all the questions we had. We decided on the margarita pizza and it came out quickly. Ashley came to check up on us frequently and made sure we were great. We got to talking about school and work and we had so much in common! I loved that she acknowledged me and my boyfriend and kept us so happy the whole time we were there! She even offered us dessert and suggested one for us but we were honestly so full! So happy with Ashley and her service and her genuine smile. I'll be coming back more often.

My 2 stars are for the quality of food and overall food experience. Two weeks ago, my hubby and I go in for a quick bite. I'm not starving so I order the lettuce wraps. The server comes over and apologizes because they're out of lettuce??? Tonight we go in with the family. 3 of us order the chicken Milanese, I order the lettuce wraps and soup. Server comes over 5 minutes later, they're out of chicken to make the Milanese??? The family orders pastas which we hope they can accommodate. When our meals arrive, the actual chicken mixture for my lettuce wrap smells microwaved. Like they popped it in the microwave a little too long so the chicken pieces are dry and stuck together. The sauce for the wraps is over seasoned. It was not good at all. What's happened to CPK? All that revamping to have food quality issues and how do you run out of food items on your menu???

Great night thanks to this place! And let's not forget the other dinner which consisted of 15+ crazy young adults coming together for a hip hop team dinner. We probably asked for bread about 100 times and also asked for butter instead of their oil.

The bread was really crunchy not as soft and the chicken was cold. I though the chicken would be hot. Still the sandwich tasted good.  +++Tortilla Soup+++ This was rich and creamy with perfect balance with little sweetness to it. No too salty. I enjoyed it very much. +++Wild Mushroom Pizza+++ My daughter ordered this and I tried a slice. It was really good with all the ingredients coming together. Mushroom, blend of cheeses with Parmesan. I think it had spinach or some other greens that am not sure of. It was really good with that thin crust.  +++Mixed Salad+++ Lettuce, check peas, onions, tomatoes, feta cheese and vinaigrette dressing. Fresh and tasty.

One host pointed to an ideal little booth that my boyfriend and I both excitedly accepted. However, then the other host (who was standing next to the first host) walked us to a different side of the restaurant to a booth next to the bathroom. Of course we asked for the booth we were originally offered and she then had to check if it was available and then walked us all the way back over. We sat and our server was Erik. He was nice and answered every question we had about the menu. Service seemed a bit backed up but we understood that was due to his section being completely packed. We started off with a mango iced tea, strawberry mango cooler, and the avocado egg rolls. The rolls I have to say tasted fine but were actually just one small piece of avocado in the front and none in the rest of it. For our entrees we ordered the chicken piccata and the jambalaya fettucine . The chicken piccata was great. The chicken was moist, and we loved the capers. The jambalaya however left a lot to be desired. We actually ended up sending it back after a single bite each and apologized profusely. The taste just wasn't right and the pasta was way too thick and the textures just didn't go well together in our opinion. We did however get the butter cake for dessert which ended up being absolutely delicious. Erik said it was, ""Hands down the best dessert they have.""

We ordered the avocado rolls, tequila chicken fettuccine, mushroom pizza, souffle & butter cake. Everything was delicious (as usual). They've added some things to the menu since I was last here (like the butter cake - PHENOMENAL btw!), we stuck to a lot of our usuals, but we'll definitely be back to try new menu items.  What I really have to commend this visit is the service. We loved our server - Diego, & the manager that evening - Evan (I hope I'm spelling his name correctly). We were having a great time & Diego came to the table & apologized that the food was taking longer than it should - we didn't notice at all & felt everything was timed just fine. He was insistently accommodating, checked on us without imposing very often, & just really took care of us. He also had Evan come by the table who was also very apologetic & accommodating despite us expressing much content. They then went ahead & took care of a few items on the check. When I told Diego they really didn't have to do that he insisted that they find the extra time they noticed it took unacceptable, & they especially wanted to because of how delightful we were. We're really impressed with how aware & on top of everything they were.

He stuck his head and half of his body out of the patio door.  I said i called earlier and just needed to pick up my credit card.  He said I would need to come back tomorrow since he already locked the doors 2 minutes ago and it was a security issue.  I asked if he could just bring the card out to me and he said no.  As inconvenient as it was, I knew he would not accommodate me and I did not want to cause a scene - so I said ok and left.  He had a very unfriendly demeanor, even on the phone.  I suspect that he locked the doors early just to turn me away.  I get that it was my fault for leaving my card there but it would've been much better customer service for him to bring the card out to me or let me in since I called ahead.  It really ruined my experience, and I drove home upset.  I did not understand how it was a security issue to let me in 1-2 minutes after business hours when the restaurant was still full.  Even if he didn't want to let me in, he could've brought the card to me.  He had already stuck half his body out of the patio door so it's not like the place was locked down. I returned on Friday 6/24 to pick up my card.  A different manager was there.  I asked him who the manager from the previous night was.  He said it could be Angel or John.  I really hope that if this is an actual rule, you review exceptions to the rule for customer service purposes.  I submitted a complaint to   that night and also left a comment on the California Pizza Kitchen Facebook page.  It's been 5 days, and I have not received a response.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northridge?start=120,3.28,3.56,3.56,2.724,3.4480000000000004
56,Katie F.,"North Hills, CA",0,3,,1.0,2016-07-06,4/9/2016: I normally love California Pizza Kitchen but today was just a different story. I was a meeting a friend for lunch and was quoted 5 minutes. I waited longer than expected but that was fine. We were sat behind the host stand and waited to get greeted by our waitress/waiter. 10 minutes went by... 20 min... 30 minutes later my friend and I had already decided what we wanted to eat and drink and still had not been greeted. We decided to get up and leave but not without talking to the manager. The manager was literally the most rude manager I have ever met. He didn't care that he had customers walking out or that his staff had been incompetent enough to greet 2 girls (who worked in a restaurant and know what it is like during the lunch rush).

She came back a little later with a Dr. Pepper and waters and told me the bartender was backed up, I noticed what appeared to be two bartenders and a not so full bar. Finally the manager walks over with my drink and asks for my ID once again, which I have never experienced before. She too took a little longer than normal to give it back. She then asked for a second form of ID. I then mentioned that I just turned 30 and handed her my expired college ID with a photo from 2009 and my California driver's license has an updated photo from July of last year.

This review is solely based on the service.  Our server was Hillel and he was either a new server or just very scatter brained with no ability to multi-task whatsoever. I tried giving him the benefit of the doubt that maybe he is still learning or he was sat too many tables at once but the constant mistakes he made became too much. Examples include grabbing the dip for bread off the table (while we were holding bread in our hands ready to dip) without even asking if we had finished yet. My mom ordered a Hawaiian pizza for her and my grandma to share and he wrote down the order and proceeded to take mine. After writing my order down he looked at my grandma and asked what she would like and my mom said we are sharing a Hawaiian pizza remember. When they finally brought the pizza no extra plate was brought for my grandma so we asked someone for an extra plate and he brought the smallest plate he could find. We asked Hillel, our server for a bigger plate. We never got the plate, go figure.  Also, one of the managers working tonight, John, is just about the saddest excuse for a main manager. No customer service skills or knowledge of accommodating a customer. I wanted to substitute chips and salsa for a simple and small side salad and he said it can't be done. The poor employees at this restaurant are running around the restaurant busting their butts and apparently he is too good to help anyone. He walked around the restaurant aimlessly for about an hour and a half, never helping anyone. He checked the time several times to see when his shift would be over and also found the time to chat with fellow employees. An embarrassment to this establishment.

The Chicken Tequila Fettuccine was good as I expected. That kick of lime which I guess is the 'tequila' is definitely pleasing to my palate and I reallly enjoyed the dish. We also got an appetizer, chips and guacamole. Even though portion was ridiculously tiny, guacamole was very fresh and wasnt too strong of flavor, which I personally prefer.

Luckily they said that they can make the Grilled Veggie sandwich as a Vegan Grilled Veggie sandwich and I ordered The Original BBQ Chicken sandwich and Super Spinach + Quinoa salad.  After ordering my sandwich I regretted that why did I order BBQ chicken, since I wasn't feeling to eat the sandwich with strong taste of BBQ sauce, but I just waited and didn't change my order. We waited 15 min for our food to be ready , thankfully not so long.  Oh my god! The Original BBQ Chicken sandwich was so bomb; bite after bite I just couldn't wait to chew. First of all, my concern was pointless, the BBQ sauce taste was so mild and the sandwich itself was so tangy and delicious. The flavors of this sandwich hit all the taste buds and literally I cannot say enough how utterly delicious was my sandwich. Spinach + Quinoa salad was amazing the sour taste of green apples added a tanginess flavor to the salad. My sister also loved her flavorful vegan sandwich.

I told her in all my years over never EVER witnessed this! And she also mentioned there are lots of rats in the area which ok I get it - I live in Burbank and because of fruit trees but I HAVE NEVER WITNESSED SUCH A THING. Turns out she was the assistant General Manager - she gave me the wrong number for corporate I found out this morning. My daughter had blood on the back of her shirt because the rat was all bloody (yes we seen it ourselves) and was completely freaked out so much that she had to change her shirt into something we bought earlier at the mall in the car. In my opinion the manager should have tried to calm the customers down if nothing else announced they needed to close and send us on our way or SOMETHING other then hiding behind the counter with the rest of her employees allowing the scene to unfold into chaos so much so that t thought someone had a gun inside with as much chaos as was going on!!!

I ordered the Banh Mi bowl, which was a pretty baffling name for a salad of chicken, quinoa, and vegetables that had virtually nothing in common with the baguette of roast pork, pickled veggies, and herbs that the dish is named after.  The veggies seemed fresh and the dressing was a solid if fairly typically Asian-style vinaigrette, but there wasn't much flavor throughout the dish - blanching, roasting or pickling some of the ingredients would've helped to give it some more variety.  I was also confused by the large chunks of raw serrano peppers served with the dish, since serranos are quite hot and biting down on these was pretty intense - again, picking them or even serving them in smaller pieces would've helped. The overall product was a relatively plain bowl that was probably a bit less tasty than what you'd get from a fast casual place for $7-8, but this cost $15 (and the portion was not particularly large given that most of the volume was taken up by spiralized veggies).   My recommendation is to go out and eat an actual banh mi.

When the food finally showed up, they were missing a lot of items. One of the salads was ordered with dressing on the side but they just brought the salad without any dressing. We had to ask them for the dressing which took another 5-10 minutes to get. We were also missing my food and the pasta that one of our friends had ordered. That took another 10 minutes or so to eat. Which meant that the other food got cold because they wanted to wait until everyone had their food to eat.  None of the food was great, and definitely wouldn't make me want to come back here. This place is also very overpriced for mediocre chain restaurant food. There's so many better options out there that I don't know why anyone would want to come here.

I met with car accident on June 17 so I have multiple fracture along with pelvic fractures and right arm fracture, I also have a 5 months old baby. On August 7th around 7 pm  we went out to this CPK for dinner with my husband,my parents and my 5 months old baby for the very first time after the accident.While my family was waiting outside with the baby, I wanted to sit inside and wait, I walked in alone with a cane and body brace, first of all no one opened the door for me even though there was a girl standing at the counter, I understand  they are very busy I didn't mind it. After waiting for 20 to 30 mins finally when they gave us the seat they gave a round table with wooden chairs, with my pelvic fractures it will hurt me to sit on it so I asked the lady ( she took us to the table ) if she can give us a booth with cushion or atleast give cushion on the table for me, for that she said sorry, she cannot give one as they have reservations so cant give me those booths and also cant provide me cushion or better chair as they dont have one. She said I will have to wait again in queue to get a better seat to be available. (I did see empty booths , they gave the booth to the family who came after us) My husband talked to the manager, she said sorry to him and said they cant fit us to that available  booth since we have a stroller and its fire hazard etc, (We could have parked the stroller and just kept the car seat if needed). We had to leave without eating ,we were very disappointed the way they treated a family with a disabled person and a 5 months old infant, I believe they could have definitely done something to help this situation. Also the manager didn't come and say sorry to me . She just watched us leave.So we went to ""Yard House"" next door for the first time and loved the food and menu, service and of course the seats were very comfortable.

I paid $24 including tax for their new entree & when I took a bite the meat was about 98% pure fat. I have no idea why the chef would think this would be an acceptable piece of meat to serve. Since I ordered ""to go"" I couldn't even complain without driving back. A total waste of my money and time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northridge,2.88,3.13,3.38,,3.03

4,Marlene H.,"Granada Hills, CA",1,44,16.0,1.0,2017-12-27,"Wow worst visit ever. As I was there I took notes regarding my stay. First off we got sat down and waited 12 mins just to be greeted by the waitress, just greeted. I guess she sensed our frustration in my kids since they were hungry and started giving us a bad attitude. After we order our foos the kids pizza comes out burnt, literally burnt( I have attached a photo to show) The waitress recommended my 4 year old who was crying from burnt pizza that we cut off the burnt side. I couldn't believe it. When she did that I gave her a look and then she realized it was a bad idea to say that and made another one. In the end when we had food left over and we asked for a box. She said she would box it for us and took our food to the back out of sight. I don't know what happened to our food at that point so I accepted it but trashed it outside. She could have done someone bad to it she knew we were not happy. I still have Her a 20% tip but I won't return ever",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northridge,2.88,3.1,3.36,,3.0120000000000005

We where seated and graciously treated by our waiter who's advice came in handy when ordering for a meat lover. My BF had the Juicy, tender, perfectly grilled ribeye topped with creamy bleu cheese compound butter, roasted potatoes, and arugula salad for the perfect dinner plate. My choice of Waldorf chicken salad was tasty, fresh, and delicious. There is nothing not to love about CPK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-northridge,3.04,3.11,3.38,,3.082
