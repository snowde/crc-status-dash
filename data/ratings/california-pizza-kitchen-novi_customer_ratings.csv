54,Ashley N.,"Kansas City, MO",22,34,1.0,5.0,2012-11-14,Well...I'm shocked by how many people dislike this place and I am a restaurant SNOB! I am never disappointed when I go to ANY CPK location. Now I will say that I have never ordered their pizza...please don't judge...but I only order the pasta and salads. Their pasta is absolutely excellent every single time!! The ingredients are always fresh the food is not microwaved or taste as if it were frozen at one time.  When I want great pasta dishes with no worries of if it will be a hit or miss I always turn to CPK...It's my #1!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-novi?start=20,2.772,2.772,2.772,2.772,2.7720000000000002
39,Alex T.,"Livonia, MI",34,235,5.0,2.0,2013-01-06,"I have given the CPK chain about five chances to satisfy me.  People seem to rave about their pizza all the time. I have tried several different varieties including classic pepperoni and the famous BBQ chicken.  I just don't understand why people think it's so good.  To me, it's mediocre pizza at an inflated price.  I have consistently felt like I overpaid for what I received. With so many excellent pizza places in the Novi/Detroit area, I don't know why anyone would come here for pizza.  Find a local place, pay less, and eat better pizza, Aside from the food and price, everything else is great.  Quick service, clean, and a nice atmosphere.  However, food is what makes a restaurant a restaurant and this place is lacking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-novi?start=20,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44

SO, we chose some pizza, California style. I have to acknowledge that they've really upped their game since last I visited. Sure they still do the pizzas, pastas, salads, but I noticed a change in their ingredients....for the better. Bacon is supplied by Nueske, a nice looking wine and beer list, and a lovely thin crust pizza that I got topped with gorgonzola, pear, and hazelnuts. It also came with some greens tossed with a gorgonzola dressing and I quite liked it. It's not fine dining but for mall food it's juuuust fine. If I had my choice of where to go this wouldn't rank 1st on my list or even top 10 or 20....maybe more.

It came out overcooked. No tenderness just dry. I expected way more for $18.  I must say i like the microbrews at chain restaurants that I'm seeing in Michigan. Finally some good variety.

45,Scott G.,"MILFORD, MI",0,28,4.0,3.0,2013-06-11,"Love the atmosphere and the décor. Clean, friendly and inviting.  Have eaten here several times already having the spinach artichoke dip; four cheese ravioli; spaghetti Bolognese and the margherita pizza.  I really can't complain about the food. It's tasty, good and the presentation is spot on as well. But, I do have a couple observations.  First, my four cheese ravioli was good. Only problem, there wasn't enough of it. My portion would have been great for a lunch service but when I pay $12.50 for ravioli I expect just a few more in the bowl, which was more like a soup bowl you'd serve at lunch.  I was still hungry when I left after a recent outing. I have to quip that in that respect this really does remind me of California - it's not cheap and the portions are small. Number two; I love good service, but sometimes the service can be too good. An example was last night. The waitress was asking us about dessert before we were halfway done with our meal.  Then, a few moments later (my buddy still was in the midst of eating his third piece of pizza and I my ravioli) she brought the bill. She said there was no rush but asking about dessert halfway through the meal and bringing the bill certainly suggests a ""get outta here soon"" mentality and no, it wasn't past closing time and we weren't exactly lingering over drinks.  I know our waitress was just trying to provide good service but it was a bit overly ambitious. All in all, not a bad place to eat and certainly a cut above the rest of the similar fare in 12 Oaks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-novi?start=20,2.7,2.7,2.7,2.7,2.7

47,Anna N.,"Wixom, MI",1,27,,4.0,2013-10-03,"Love this place. Been here twice and both times had a great experience.  Got pizza both times so only commenting and rating on that and overall service/experience. Got the works on whole grain and it was delicious. I like to people watch at restaurants...I know it's annoying to catch someone staring in your direction but I mostly do it just to check out and guess what the dish someone else is eating/portion size etc.  I would like to try the pasta's here but I honestly hate to say that paying over $10 for a pasta dish anywhere other than some michelin star restaurant just doesn't bode well with me. Also some creamy pasta dishes I can never finish fully either so I hate to waste my money on thick overly filling dishes and thats why I mostly stick to pizza's at italian style joints. I mean come on you can handmake your own alfredo sauce with ingredients most already have in their kitchen...then you can buy pasta and some garlic bread at the supermarket for under $10 and feed a group of people. Just my opinion though. I have the same view on salads also for the most part. I had to give one whole star to CPK for introducing me to Beringer's Zinfandel wine...omg...it's the nicest wine I have ever had, no joke! I better be able to find it in Ireland when I return home this month. Also the desserts are above par. I've only tried the red velvet cheesecake and it was amazing.

I sat at the bar, the bartender/server did not wipe the counter down. Also, it took 3 times of asking for a water to receive one. The bartenders left all there personal belongs like keys, phones, purses all over the bar. The bartenders threw straws over the ground, spilled drinks all over, left straw wrappers all over. Also we could see the back area where all the servers type in their tables orders and it was a pig stye.

Good sandwiches, good salad, the pasta was good too. I think for your money, the sandwich is your best deal here. The pizza/salad/soup/entrees are a bit overpriced, but at least don't disappoint. Their ""butter cake"" dessert option is stupidly good, just unreal. Try to go here when they give out the mystery coupon thing with your bill. You basically go through a meal like normal and then they give you this coupon at the end that'll be good for an unknown discount on your next meal, assuming you go back in like a month's time.

We ate around 5pm, my stomach started bubbling and gurgling from 9-10pm and then the extreme cramping. I feel fine this morning but whatever the reason for the pain, it's safe to say I will not be ordering that dish again. My husband loved the pizza so we will just stick to that!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-novi,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005
4,Terri H.,"Waterford, MI",1,10,8.0,4.0,2017-01-16,"I had a terrific time, Chloe was our server and likely the best service I have had in a while.  We were greeted at the door by our server that continued the fun and happiness at the table.  Suggested some meal ideas, drinks, and of course desserts.   We even ordered our lunch for tomorrow and along with the appetizers we might even have dinner.  Great portions with a very fair price.  Chloe explained how everything is fresh and showed us a few things. Why is it 4 stars and not 5..... I'm in the business and you cannot run out of the basics and/or the drinks that are on the menu, no bueno.  I also ordered a drink off the menu that was not great, the citrus crush (less absolute Citron) was not good....I would not recommend it. Ordered the ever famous avacado/chicken egg rolls that bring me here all the time.  The pesto pasta with chicken was Uber fabulous, the pizza was great.   So with all that said, my girls and I don't get time together so Chloe, I thank you for making a dinner tonight with Elle, Christy and I an experience instead of just a meal.   See you soon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-novi,3.08,3.08,3.08,,3.0800000000000005

8,Calvin K.,"Ferndale, MI",2,62,24.0,1.0,2017-04-23,1 hour for 2 thin sliced pizza and we got them they were burnt like a chip. 15 people sitting in the restaurant not busy at all. What a horrible experience. Wait an hour to have a pizza that takes no longer than 7 mins to make in the ovens they have. After waiting we couldn't even eat them.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-novi,3.08,3.08,3.08,,3.0800000000000005
18,Ba U.,"Troy, MI",0,2,,1.0,2017-04-29,"have been here many times but terrible experience today.  menu was dirty, table was dirty, waiter dint seem to care about serving.  hostess was just giving excuses.  no hot water in the men's room.  they were out of the appetizer we ordered and realized it 15 mins after we placed the order. and finally, the kids cheese pizza came out cold. we walked out right then but the manager did not even apologize. eat in the food court, you will get better food and service for a better price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-novi,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96
3,Cindy S.,"Novi, MI",0,7,,4.0,2017-05-12,"This was, by far, the best gf pizza crust I've had since going gluten-free in 2008. Very tasty! I ordered the pepperoni gluten free pizza to get the traditional pizza experience I've been missing and I was not disappointed. Great flavor in the crust, sauce and pepperoni. (Edge of crust was burnt so I had to cut all that off.)   Our server, Chloe, was great. Made sure to mark my allergy on the ticket for the kitchen staff. Was pleasant and helpful to everyone (6) at our table. The only drawback is the price...one personal size pizza with tip is $20. So I can't do it often but will reserve for a special lunch treat!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-novi,3.08,3.08,3.08,,3.0800000000000005
7,Karen D.,"Waterford Township, MI",5,31,2.0,3.0,2017-05-14,"Food was decent. When a chain has the name of a food in the title, then they just need to do that one thing right. They did but there wasn't that much that made it special.

0,Susan O.,"Dearborn, MI",0,41,27.0,5.0,2017-07-20,"Aidan's review: I ordered the Hawaiian pizza. They gave me the wrong pizza instead of my kids pizza but it all ended out well because I got to keep both pizzas! The waitress could not have been more friendly and the pizza, as always, was delicious! Mom's review: I am a big fan of CPK. They offer a tasty affordable fast casual option at several local malls which allows me to forego the crappy food courts. While they are known for their pizzas, I love their salads (especially the signature barbecue chicken salad) and tapa size appetizers (I sometimes order 2 as an alternative to ordering a meal). They have a nice selection of beer and wine, however they really shine in regard to their amazing nonalcoholic drink options. Very nice to see some creative options in this regard! I have always received stellar service from their very friendly waitstaff. And they have a great rewards program which is definitely worth checking out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-novi,3.32,3.32,3.32,,3.3200000000000003

I think they have lost their minds.  We settled for a mushroom pizza which was so so.  This was a disappointment in comparison with earlier visits.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-novi,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006
5,Amy L.,"East Lansing, MI",0,12,3.0,1.0,2017-12-06,"We arrived on a Tuesday afternoon, and the restaurant was not at all busy. We were seated immediately, but waited quite a while for our server to show up. Finally ""Taylor"" showed up and brought us water. We didn't see her again for almost 20 minutes even though we made our decisions quickly and set the menus on the edge of the table so that she could see we were ready. She was up at the bar area chatting and was not watching her tables. She seemed preoccupied, never smiled and was not at all pleasant. After she finally took our order, things continued to go downhill. We ordered a Caesar salad to split, which was bought in a large bowl and a Margherita  pizza. There were two small plates already at the table that we used for the salad. The pizza came from another server and had two HUGE air bubbles that were very noticeable. I wish I had taken a picture to attach to the review. Our salad plates were never removed and we had only those dirty plates to use for our pizza. The salad bowl sat teetering on the edge of the table as we tried to make room for everything. Taylor never removed the dirty dishes, never checked back and we didn't see her again until she brought our bill. The Margherita pizza tasted more like thin cheese bread. Toppings were skimpy and most pieces had very little cheese and no tomatoes on them. Taylor definitely needs more training and the cooks need to make sure the food is presentable before it comes out. We won't ever come back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-novi,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004
