Let me tell ya, I'M GLAD I DID THIS TIME!  I don't know about everything they offer, but I ordered the habanero carnita pizza and washed it down with a Windy City Wheat Beer...delicious!  Even the staff was super helpful.  I was there with 4 adults, and 3 small kids (1 of whom was my 3 month old Gabriel who was FREAKING OUT!) and despite the fact they were slammed, they sat us promptly and made extra consideration to give us the space we needed!  Great experience, and definitely made me reconsider my chain restaurant ""prejudice""....well, at least at this CPK!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oak-brook?start=100,3.24,3.24,3.24,3.504,3.2400000000000007

As the waiter walked us to our table we could see the kitchen and you could see the pizza oven that they cooked all the pizza in, it smelled so good and it made you very,very, hungry.

50,Courtney C.,"Chicagoland, IL",198,839,1924.0,4.0,2012-12-17,"Where I grew up, there were no CPK locations. CPK to us was just frozen pizzas at the grocery store. I'm glad that I work close to this CPK location and have been able to experience it because I'm a pretty big fan now! I've had pasta and thin crust pizza in the past and liked them. The pizzas are a little different from most pizza joints and most are thin crust and not flavors you'd find at traditional pizza locations. Last week our work catered a lunch for us from CPK. I had the chicken tortilla soup, the carnitas tacos, chips & salsa, and a piece of red velvet cake. Way too much food for one person, but I saved half of it for dinner. The chicken tortilla soup, I ordered based on Yelp recco's, so thanks guys! It was fantastic and some of the greatest soup I've had in awhile. I would have traded the rest of my meal in for 3 more cups of that soup. The carnitas tacos were really good, but by the time I got to them, the avocado had made them a bit soggy. Still tasted good though, so I can't complain. I thought that it was cool that the restaurant also threw in a nice plate of cookies and brownies which included Snickerdoodles--my favorite cookie from my childhood. One of the girls I worked with ordered the BBQ chicken pizza which has great reviews on Yelp and she said it was awesome. That's next on my ""To try' list. I did the curbside pickup and it took about 15-20 minutes from when I called and said I was there until I actually got the food, which is the only reason I didn't give 5 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oak-brook?start=60,3.48,3.48,3.48,3.408,3.4800000000000004

We loved the pizza. However I felt that the services was perhaps not the best. I never got the water that I asked for, twice.

I can plan a shopping excursion for my son at Stride Rite and the Children's Place and even get him a hair cut at Kid Snips in this area.  Then once the lunch crowd has died down, stroll(er) on in to CPK for lunch.  They definitely know they are in the Kid's Wing because they really anticipated our needs. Highchair, crayons, kids menu immediately get offered.  And after we ordered, my son's pizza came out first--which really helps when you're trying to keep a toddler occupied in a restaurant. The food is good. I'd give it 3 solid stars. My go-to is always the Thai Chicken salad and the Avocado Club Egg Rolls. The salad is always fresh and not overly dressed. Great flavors. The Egg Rolls are good too. Most of the time the avo is good; once in a while it's kind of mushy, but for the most part I'm happy with them.  I love the spicy dipping sauce that comes with the egg rolls and they even gave me some to take home with my left over egg rolls.  Friendly service bumps it up to 4 stars. Checking on us often, refilling drinks, picking up crayons he dropped so I don't have to get up, holding the door open for me and my stroller son?

I went in around 6:30pm and was seated in the back. I was waiting for my mom and brother, so the waitress brought bread, oil and drinks, which I appreciated. CPK has been trying to upgrade and seem a bit ""fancier"" lately, and I have mixed feelings about it. Some of my usual favorites have been ""upgraded"" and I do not like them anymore.  We started with the Cesar salad, which was good as usual. I ordered the Pepperoni pizza light sauce and it was delicious. I usually get the traditional cheese, but it's no longer on the menu. My brother also ordered a pizza and my mom had a pasta, which she enjoyed.  My main problem was the service. Our waitress was pregnant, so I'm not sure if it had to do with that but she only came back maybe 2 times and we often had to ask other servers or the bus boy for more drinks, the check, etc. It was irritating enough to cause me to write this review.

122,Maureen M.,"Oak Lawn, IL",0,3,,1.0,2014-03-22,"Today I had a pretty miserable experience at CPK. It is only my second time here. The first time was because my sister threw a party here for my nieces birthday. We went because at the party my children received coupons for a free build-your-own-pizza which is a great way to bring people back to try it again with their families. However, although yes it may have been busy, they said my kids couldn't build their own pizza because it was ""too busy""? Why send a coupon if you can not hold true to it? Anyways, we looked past it. The kids got over it and the kitchen just made their pizza for them. Me and my mom decided to split a salad and a pizza. The kids food came out, then our salad came out. The salad was very good (California Cobb). We were starting to wonder when the pizza was coming. Once everyone was done with everything the waitress asked if we wanted her to send the kids desserts over. I said ""can you just wait a little bit til we get our pizza?"" And that's when it happened. She looked very puzzled and was like ""pizza?"" Then she went over to the computer and ordered it, clearly Bc she had forgotten. I have been in the restaurant industry for my whole life. If she would have said ""my fault I totally forgot to ring it in"" ""or I'll have it out right away"" or ANYTHING to fix the mistake we would have been fine with it. However, it was busy, the kids were done eating, and then she came over and told us that someone took the pizza? Really?! Like someone just took the pizza? You don't have tickets? Or tables numbers? Or managers? Is the kitchen a free for all? The point is, is that just fess up, tell the manager and fix the problem. But instead, you have created a poor experience and a loss of customers when there is so many restaurants to choose from.

For starters they asked if they could bring out some oil and bread. And I said sure, because for heaven's sake, who doesn't get the free oil and bread? While technically free, it was quite hard. Also there were four relatively small chunks. I was a bit disappointed.  In addition we got strawberry and raspberry lemonade. Both could have come from mixes. At least consider the thought of blending in real berries, guys.  I ordered mac n' cheese bites for an appetizer, which were small but fried up nice and crispy. I'm uncertain as to the origins of the cheese, but I would get it again.  Their namesake pizzas are still quite good. I had a peanut Thai pizza that had fresh, crunchy vegetables, while my wife had her usual barbecue chicken. The honey wheat crust has been refined since the last time I've gone, and is better now.

56,Rachel L.,"Lombard, IL",0,12,,1.0,2016-01-31,"So it's taken me about a week to cool off from the horrible service my family received last Friday evening. My family and I were shopping and decided to go to CPK for our dinner as this is one of our favorite pizza places.  had we known what we were in for we would have turned around and went elsewhere! The hosted was very sweet and she was not the issue, it was the servers. We got sat in a both that was dirty so we asked to have it cleaned so they decided to move us to the back section, which was already closed off, but they still sat us there. In the process of us moving to the new table a server came up behind me and said move I'm right behind you. Last time I check 1. I don't have eyes in the back of my head and 2. You never talk to someone that way period! I moved out of his way but apparently he was already aggravated with me and decided to again tell me to move myself out of his way. Okay I give him the benefit of the doubt because he had to get his drink order to his table. No that's is not where it stopped. He then was talking shit about me and my child to his fellow coworker saying this bitch and her kids almost made me drop my glasses. I kid you not the other server had a look of horror realizing that he heard what he said. Whatever, I ignored it and went on to the bath room. When I got back to the table our server Max was irritated we where in his section, had no personality, and you could tell by his demeanor he wanted nothing to do with us in his section. We ordered, got our food and then noticed something very disturbing with where and how they store their Parmesan cheese they gladly sprinkle on your food. Last time I checked that kind of cheese should be far from your POS (point of service system) & on ice to keep it fresh. No it was sitting in an open container next to the POS and out in the open and made me think that if they are doing this small of thing out in the open, what does their kitchen look like or their coolers where they keep everything?  Max could have cared less about his guest and the only he was happy was when he decided to get his tip! He and his bearded buddy (the one that was talking crap) treated the bus boy so badly, never helped him pre bus his tables and left it all for him to clean. There were 8 tables with people sitting at them with empty glasses, tables filled with empty plates and these servers just stood there chit chatting with one another. The funny thing is my mom is a server so we get the whole restaurant process. My message to management, walk around your establishment and see what's going on, then maybe you'll see the cracks in your service so that your servers will actually treat their customers right, and the way your male staff treat your hard working bus staff better. My advice to the servers, be very cautious to who you wait on, you never know who they are or what they do for a living!

I'm gluten free and I ordered a side salad and croutons were in there.  Got a sad apology, that was major f*** up and all I got was apology.  She should have taken it off our bill.  If I eat gluten I got sick and all I got was a sad apology 2. We sat at a high top that was horribly uncomfortable.  Everyone around us said this is the worst seating they have ever sat.  Terrible for kids and adults. Thin bench, just horrible 3.

I started with the Sedona tortilla soup, which I typically love, except this time it was thick and chalky. The petite wedge salad was wilted and boring, and the pesto cream penne was anything but creamy and lacked flavor.

The wait time is minimum. They have their own menu with an activity and page to color and they give the little ones crayons, which is nice and cute. My daughter loves the chicken nuggets and the cheese pizza. Their entrees come with a drink with free re-fills and you can add dessert, like ice-cream for a buck $1, so like I said great place to eat with kiddes. They have a nice menu for adults as well. I love their lettuce wraps. Tasty, fully of flavor and plentiful. It comes as an appetizer, but its so filling it can be your entree. Their salads and pizzas are good too. The BBQ chicken pizza is my favorite. Drinks are good and tasty, but not as potent as they can be. If I spend $10 on an alcoholic beverage I expect a little kick. I typically prefer their flavored lemonades that come in a variety of flavors, like strawberry, raspberry and mango.

We went here with well over an hour leeway, close to an hour and a half, thinking this would be faster than a steakhouse. We didn't even get pizzas which might take longer. Fail. Next time we'll know. Also, jokingly when my friend was pretend pouting over not being special enough to get a coaster with her drink, I mockingly joked that they were racist. With the delays and inattentiveness, now I'm not so sure I should have been joking. She's African American. Her hubby and I aren't yet got coasters. Silly, I know.

We asked for menus while we waited (even though there were many empty tables), and mine was missing a center card and had a large drip of oil inside. Our hostess didn't seem like she knew what she was doing as she led us to a table, which didn't have enough bread plates for our party. When our waitress brought out water, my thirsty self immediately took a sip and she warned us that the cups were only rinsed, not washed, and gave us straws. While I'm thankful she warned us, CPK... yall, what the hell??  When our food finally came out, we received no forks and, after asking, learned they were out of them... which was a problem considering we ordered three pasta plates. My California club pizza sounded great on paper and looked pretty in pictures, but basically, it was a bunch of avocado and lettuce with some bacon/chicken on a pizza crust. No sauce, not much cheese. I got a lot of jokes about my ""salad"". The positives, our waitress was super nice in spite of the clusterfuck that seemed to be going on! I appreciated her honesty and friendly service. A lot of the staff seemed very pressed but very nice, it seems like most of the problems are logistical.
