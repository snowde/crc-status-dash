0,Niti B.,"Chicago, IL",278,630,172,5.0,2013-08-19,I love CPK!  There is always something new to try and never anything that leaves me feeling like I was unhealthy.   I enjoy the tostado pizza the most with the Mexican ingredients toppled onto a fresh warm crust.  The crunch of the chip strips adds a bit of texture and the combination is delicious. I've also tried the Asian salad with the peanut dressing that leaves you wanting to lick the plate clean. The basic Caesar salad dressed up with grilled salmon is a favorite as well.  Healthy but hearty.   Of course you can't leave CPK without dessert.  And the molten cake is the best chocolate dessert I've found at a chain restaurant. Service is always quick and great.  The location is perfect to rest your feet after shopping all day.  As you look around you will find girlfriends gabbing and families enjoying the food and atmosphere.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-oakbrook-terrace,,,,,
