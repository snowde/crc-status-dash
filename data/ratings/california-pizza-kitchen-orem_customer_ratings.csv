46,Mrs D.,"American Fork, UT",0,41,16.0,4.0,2013-09-18,Eat here quite often.  Over the years the service has consistently stayed mediocre at best & makes me wonder who is training these servers!?!  Food & atmosphere is good enough that it keeps us coming back even with service generally below average.  As a standard their turnaround time in getting your order back out to you is and always has been exceptionally long regardless of the time of day in which you frequent the restaurant & if you order a pizza or not...Because let's be realistic pizzas take approximately 30 min: 10 minutes prep time and 20 minutes to bake. *Tiramisu far surpassed Olive Garden's but the Salted Caramel Pudding is to die for!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orem?start=20,3.024,3.024,3.024,3.024,3.024

28,Freddy Z.,"Orem, UT",36,7,15.0,5.0,2016-03-08,"I came in to CPK with my wife because a friend of mine told me that they were revamping the menu, and so I thought it would be a great excuse to take my wife out on a date. I was starving when I came in so asked the server what app he recommends, and he said I should try the avocado egg rolls. I ordered those and they really were good. They were light and had tons of different flavors. Bacon, avocado, chicken, tomato, chz and they came with two hefty side dishes of ranch and Chipolte?  For the entree my wife ordered the roasted garlic chicken and I ordered the new Ribeye. I noticed that the chicken breast she ordered came with fried Skin! Yum. She let me take a bite and it was as good as it looked! My Ribeye was perfect. I think it was a 12 oz but it was a nice thick cut, and the garlic butter on top was so good.  Me and my wife ate everything, and we were stuffed. But a good stuffed, like we were totally satisfied stuffed. Even though I was stuffed; if you would have put another one of those entrees in front of me I still would have taken another bite and I would have exploded. I haven't left a restaurant that full but satisfied in I don't know how long.  I think the new menu is a game changer for this place. It has been known for more than pizza for quite some time but now it's going to be known for much much more.

15,Rod S.,"Orem, UT",193,757,603.0,4.0,2016-03-13,"My how things must have changed since Ed LaDou created the first CPK menu that did include the Chicken BBQ Pizza. This is really standard style pizza with CA style toppings. It's not gourmet CA pizza. P712 does that at a similar price. This was my second trip in the last year, and my second trip period. I have no memory what I ate on the first trip, it wasn't memorable. I decided I should order a pizza. It is technically a Pizza place. I got the Mushroom, Pepperoni, and Italian Sausage pizza. There is a reference to it having wild oregano in it. Apparently that's a reference to someone going wild with the dried Oregano. The Oregano was stronger than it should be. As expected, the sauce is somewhat sweet like standard Pizza. The crust and cook was good. All in all, a solid American chain pizza in a nice location with a pretty good wine list by the glass and bottle. My wifes garlic pasta with shrimp was cooked pretty close to al dente and the shrimp were not over done (well done CPK). It's not likely to be a regular on the rotation, but it's no longer on my list of places not to go. I was there on a Sunday with not a lot of people. I can't imagine making the effort to be there on a busy night, and I expect the food may suffer. I think that's why the previous trip was forgettable. It was a busy night and we were at the bar to bypass the line.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orem,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006

Still, it took awhile before they brought around the bread, and the food took a noticeably long time to come out. Once it did come out, the waiter made a rookie blunder by making the tray unbalanced and half our food hit the deck. (2 pizzas and 1 pasta).  It took forever again but the pizzas eventually came out. They forgot the pasta. That too eventually came out, but we were already done.  I wanted to see how they would handle this. They gave us 3 vouchers for free small plates. Which you can get online pretty much anytime anyways. You can't use all 3 vouchers at the same time... We would have to come back 3 times to use them. They should have comped those dishes.

30,Dean P.,"Park City, UT",0,29,11.0,2.0,2016-07-04,This location has been consistently poor for service. We've been here three times. We love the Margarita Pizza and Cobb Salads. Today 4th of July was more of the same poor service. We were sat and waited for anyone to acknowledge we were there. If there is a manager-they aren't doing anything. We ended up walking out.    We've been to dozens of CPK's and rarely had such poor service. Millennial servers are often clueless and self-absorbed. We went to PF Chang's next door and were greater by the waiter there in 30 seconds after being seated.

But the portions are good. I usually go home with at least half of my pizza. And the salads are quite large. A half salad is easily shared between 2-3 people if you're wanting something else as well. I love the Jamaican jerk chicken pizza, although I ask for the hand tossed crust instead of the thin. Cause the hand tossed is thin too! Many family members of mine love the BBQ chicken pizza.

Lunch time for him occurred right after his Radiation/Chemotherapy treatment. After treatment, he was delighted with a wonderful conversation with a waiter by the name of Jake who could relate with my father due to recent tender loss of his aunt, who was battling cancer just like my father. Typically, clients and waiters/waitress usually have tender, small talk. This was not the case, Jake had such an empathic way with dealing with the illness that most recently plagued our morals as a family.  it not only brought tears and emotions to my dad and it also brought tears to everyone else on the table. As the meal went on, little to our surprise the meal was covered by the staff of CPK. As we fought to rebuttal the free meal, the staff was firm on their kind gesture and their only request was to see my father again. Not for business, but for hope. THIS REVIEW DOES NOT DO THIS CPK LOCATION JUSTICE. When you read this review, please internalize this one message;  the staff here does much more than deliver wonderful food and great customer services, they make life changing experiences and meaningful relationships.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orem?start=20,3.2,3.2,3.2,,3.2000000000000006

What I like about CPK is that it has a variety of foods in the menu so if you go with a large group, like we did, it is easy for everyone to find something they like.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orem,3.48,3.48,3.48,,3.4800000000000004
6,Paige H.,"Provo, UT",0,4,,5.0,2017-08-15,"My mother and I went to eat here for her birthday, and we loved it! The pizza is to die for, literally mouth watering. We got the asparagus & arugula salad, so fresh and yummy! Our waiter was very nice and helpful with explaining the menu to us since it was our first time eating there. We then came a second time for dinner cause we were craving the pizza!! We got curbside take-out and Aaron helped us out, such great customer service and professionalism. They ran out of key lime pie and offered us another dessert on them, which I find very nice they didn't have to do that. Overall we've only had great experiences here! Going to come here more often.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orem,3.6,3.6,3.6,,3.6000000000000005
0,Jamie B.,"Orem, UT",2,36,1.0,4.0,2017-10-15,Still great cpk food.  Came on a Sunday.  Place is a bit dirty. Crumbs on my table and the wooden tops between the tables left a trail of pretty thick dust when I ran my hand over it. You could see the dust clearly. Maybe a little attention to detail is needed. Looking a little run down.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orem,3.6,3.6,3.6,,3.6000000000000005

We came in last night waited 15 minutes for menus, never got our appetizers or waters, adults food came way before children. It wasn't very busy but they were clearly either understaffed or their managers weren't doing their job, I think it was both. Our server was clearly in the weeds running around like crazy. Meanwhile, two women managers underdressed with messy buns are just chatting away near the kitchen line in   La la land for about 20 minutes. I just stared at them in disbelief as the servers are all tripping over one another, I felt really bad for them. Finally,  I asked our host if he would send the manger over, we were currently waiting for sides of ranch, waters and kids foods, she didn't bring anything over except her apologies. After she left we were still waiting, but she did bring us $15 gift cards and again, without our waters or ranch, lol it's almost hilarious if it weren't so frustrating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orem,3.52,3.52,3.52,,3.5200000000000005
