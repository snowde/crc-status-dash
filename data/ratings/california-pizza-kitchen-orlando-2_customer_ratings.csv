8,Wayne + Penny W.,"Coventry, CT",0,85,,4.0,2012-02-14,"LOML and I needed to refuel before we hit the airport and when you are in a rush, need good food with terrific service...we're talking CPK. We started with white corn guacamole and chips, moved on to the original BBQ chopped chicken salad and field green with shrimp. I added some Sadona tortilla soup, a couple of cokes, and we're off to the airport and back to CT. All the food is fresh, the restaurant impeccably clean and the wait staff efficient and friendly. What's not to like? We don't like chains but this is an exception. Great work by California Pizza Kitchen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-2,,,,,
11,Jamie S.,"Melbourne, FL",35,285,55.0,3.0,2012-05-12,Surprisingly tasty food. Decent prices. Very slow service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-2,,,,,
10,Eladio D.,"Orlando, FL",0,8,7.0,4.0,2013-03-23,The food is great . Ashley is excellent. But the carpet still has a musty odor . They need to replace it.  I would put ceramic tile.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-2,,,,,
16,Amie B.,"Deerfield Beach, FL",9,50,3.0,5.0,2013-06-29,"i just went here with my brother for veteran's day. he got free pizza for vet's day, and he started talking to a manager, and was saying how he almost feels a bit bad for getting all this free food on veterans day, which seems like its for those guys that get blown up and such, to make up for that, and not for the guy who just gets coffee for those guys, who is also technically a veteran even if never in combat. it was my idea to bring that up to someone else, since he was telling it to me, and the man patiently listened to him, then smiled, and reminded him that even the guy getting coffee for the air force pilots and such are part of the machine, and they help it run, so theres no reason to feel guilty for it. the coffee is just an example, he did much more important stuff than that, but he didnt feel like it. but he made my brother feel so much better, and was so sweet. i liked that. i didnt know it then, but just being in the military DID takea huge toll on us all, it wasnt nonsense, he did deserve it, and much more than that, because now hes missing and now i have no one to take me to CPK anymore",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-2,,,,,
4,David H.,"Titusville, FL",13,18,16.0,5.0,2013-08-03,"My wife has been a fan of CPK frozen pizza for quite awhile  and did not know that it was a resturant as well. We found it tucked in a corner of the Florida Mall.  It was nice an modern inside, friendly staff, you can see them tossing pizza dough; our food arrived in good time and hot. Our starter was a spinach artichoke dip, which was warm, creamy and awesome. I had the fish taco's, my wife had roasted garlic chicken pizza and our daughter had the four cheese Ravioli; all of our food was outstanding, from the truly hand tossed pizza, perfectly cooked fish and the perfectly cooked Ravioli in its wonderful sauce.  Our waitress was Ashley and she was attentive, pleasant, friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-2,,,,,
5,Tony M.,"Boca Raton, FL",265,26,,4.0,2013-09-03,"First of all let's be clear, this is not the capital grille ... we all know that, so the rating is for that of a semi fast food type of restaurant.  W started off with the rolls and olive oil and they were okay. The service was very good.  We enjoyed the pleasant atmosphere and enough space for the kids to make a little noise playing with their new ""Despicable Me Minions: Kevin, Carl, and Steve...   the boys had a cheese pizza, my wife made her own cheese-less with veggies and I had the new garlic chicken pizza with caramelized onions and golden scallions off the chain for pizza!  The only disappointment was the margarita my wife and I split-way too much sour mix.  The night before we had the ""perfect margarita"" at Margaretville; which is hard to top, but that's a whole other review!  Oh, try the butter cake with vanilla ice-cream YUM!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-2,,,,,
2,Sumi G.,"Orlando, FL",85,33,,3.0,2013-09-20,"I usually avoid chains but CPK is one of the ones I like to go to every now and then, especially when I go shopping. The food is decent but the service is SO slow! I've been to this CPK twice and my apps have come out 20 mins later with the pizzas.  Don't come here hungry!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-2,,,,,
0,Diana R.,"Orlando, FL",13,13,4.0,4.0,2013-11-20,"Consistent food and service!  Great place to have lunch while your at the mall.     Today I had one of their small plate meals, a flat bread.  I had the Bianco with Kendal Jackson Chardonnay, and they paired beautifully.  I would defiantly get this pairing again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-2,,,,,
3,Charles O.,"New York, NY",14,59,1.0,1.0,2014-04-22,"Dismal experience.  Slow, indifferent service, nasty food.  We have been to many California Pizza Kitchens, and have always found the atmosphere to be friendly, and the food to be tasty.  Not here.  We waited a long time (45 minutes?) for two pizzas.  One was cold, with raw mushrooms on top - not at all like the menu promised; the other was hot, but not cooked all the way through.  Avoid, unless you want an expensive, depressing dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-2,,,,,
1,Jonathan R.,"Orlando, FL",0,40,32.0,4.0,2014-08-17,"The BBQ salad was a refreshing higher scale choice for dinner. I also had the Tortilla spring rolls which I found to be a tad bit cooler on the temperature then I would have preferred. Love, my server, was on top of my experience and never let me get low on my ice tea. Overall, this is a better choice then the food court, especially during peak times at the Florida Mall. The 4 star review is based on other mall choices as most food court food cannot compare to the quality found here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-2,,,,,
