However, some of the items on the menu were slightly not as we expected the Cranberry Walnut Chicken Salad sandwich was really bland. The bread was great (chewy and fresh) but the items in between was not so great.  Chicken was slightly dry and limited.  I flapped open the bread and saw that it was mostly lettuce and tomatoes.  The chicken was so dry that I had to order some mayonnaise on side.  Although the chicken pieces were large in size, the cranberry and walnut were barely there.  I guess they were chopped in bits and pieces that were hard to detect. If you like larger chicken pieces covered in lettuce bits and sliced tomatoes with 20% of walnut, cranberry and onion with THICK bread, maybe this is your sandwich. Overall the experience was memorable in terms of the friendliness level.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-3?start=60,2.8880000000000003,2.8880000000000003,2.8880000000000003,2.8880000000000003,2.888000000000001

So long as you're not aiming to visit in the high shopping days of December, it's usually easy to park nearby. Unlike the Florida Mall location, this one is in a high-traffic area of the mall -- offering lots of people-watching potential if you're in the half of the restaurant facing the food court. Three of us dined for a ""catch-up-with-a-freind"" occasion, and the meal was perfectly paced for that. The right length of pauses, the right (few) number of interruptions, and not a moment's hesitation to split a check. Two tasty red sangrias and a half-salad later and I was perfectly sated and reacquainted with a friend. The only thing that could have enhanced the meal would have been someone controlling a young rug rat who used the divider between tables as his personal jungle gym the first half of the meal.

37,Janene H.,"Apopka, FL",771,1351,2078.0,3.0,2012-10-04,"California Pizza Kitchen is good every once in a while. I like their BBQ chicken salad. It is hearty and filling and somehow all those unusual ingredients go well together. We also got the Thai pizza which was indeed different. It wasn't bad, but was spicier than I expected and probably wouldn't order it again. Service was decent but not outstanding. The restaurant was seating everyone in one corner of the place while the rest of the restaurant was empty. Our one server did the best he could but seemed stretched a little thin. My menu had something indistinguishable smashed between two pages- not setting the tone off very well.

32,Joshua M.,"Boca Raton, FL",270,288,914.0,2.0,2013-09-08,"California Pizza Kitchen has really gone way down hill in the past couple of years in regards to the food quality and service. I remember the food here used to always taste fresh and it was always a pleasure to come here, when now it's like the 5th choice of a restaurant after all the others are too packed to go to.A friend and I went to CPK on a Saturday evening, and you know something is wrong when every other place at the mall was beyond packed, except for this place. When we sat down, it seemed to me that their menu had shrunk quite significantly. A few years back when this place was great, they had a Buffalo Chicken Pizza, they got rid of that too; just one straw of many to come.  Both of us got the Crispy Mac n' Cheese, which usually is the only reason I'd come to this place. The cheese sauce was not gooey, but very thick. The actually crispy mac n' cheese was just luke warm and not extremely flavorful. Also, their was some strange brown things around the inside of the item. So disappointed in this dish, my friend ate a few bites before leaving on the rest of the plate.  I always wanted to try the Pear and Gorgonzola thin crust pizza here, and I have had it at other places and it was great. Sadly, here I thought it was bland and terrible. When it came out, it basically had almost like a salad on top of it, a problem because it made it difficult to eat with the leafy greens dominating the pizza and making it difficult to get a slice. The pears tasted so processed and not fresh, it really ruined the dish. And even the gorgonzola sauce tasted watered down and added nothing to the dish. I'm usually a big fan of flatbread, but this time it just tasted like cardboard with lots of junk on it. Where usually elsewhere I find Pear and Gorgonzola to be fresh and tasteful, here it was exactly the opposite. My friend got the traditional BBQ Chicken Pizza, but he was not a fan this time. I didn't taste it, but from my view it looked dry and the opposite of tasty. What has happened to this place?! Our waiter was nice, but a little too pushy. From the moment we sat down we were pitched to buy things like some sort of infused water, even when we just asked for regular water. Later on, he also went in for the kill on dessert with us; we were not having it. On a positive note however, when I left my leftover box at the table, a manager came rushing way out of the restaurant to say we forgot this and give it back to us. Honestly, I left it there on purpose because it was terrible, but the fact that this guy came rushing out to give it to us earned them major points back.  At one point in time, I may have given this place a three or even four stars, but the standards here have just tumbled so far down, I fear it is not redeemable. I was so disappointed with our experience here. California Pizza Kitchen used to be our go to place to eat, and now I have to say that I'd try to avoid this place in the future at this point.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-3?start=40,2.9840000000000004,2.9840000000000004,2.9840000000000004,2.9840000000000004,2.9840000000000004

It's good fast food or mediocre good food served quickly.  I always feel like they are trying too hard to sell me more than I want here.  A little to pushy on the drink specials, appetizers, and desserts.  They did accommodate our vegan pizza request ...but you could just see and taste that there was no love in the final product. I've come to  the conclusion that their menu and business model just doesn't match what I'm looking for in a good restaurant.

84,Katie H.,"Longwood, FL",185,54,,3.0,2013-11-25,"After much debate over toppings and verifying with our waiter that there's no ""create your own"" pizza option, we decided on the thin crust spinach & artichoke and the regular five cheese & tomato. Both were enjoyable, but we all agreed that we preferred the latter as the cheese had more flavor and their thin crust is quite crispy. We each ordered a glass of red wine when the pizza arrived and by the time we received the drinks, we'd finished eating, so not the speediest service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-3?start=60,3.36,3.36,3.36,3.0520000000000005,3.3600000000000003
60,Anna-Marie W.,"Orlando, FL",213,301,800.0,3.0,2013-12-13,"We rarely frequent chain restaurants anymore as they are usually boring and predictable.  However, on a day where we found ourselves working at the Mall of Millenia in Orlando, we were starving.  We just had no interest in the choices we had at the food court and some of the other full services places had too long of a wait for us (well, me.)  We stumbled into the California Pizza Kitchen where there was no wait and we were familiar with the great food we have had here in the past. After we ordered a couple of appetizers we were immediately brought some crusty bread and olive oil.  Yum..... We started with the White Corn Guacamole and Chips.  A unique presentation, the avocado was mixed in with white corn kernels, black beans, jicama, bell peppers, cilantro and spicy serrano peppers.  It had a great creamy flavor and paired well with the salty tortilla chips. We also ordered the Fried Mac And Cheese.  They, too, were very tasty.  Lots of creamy cheese and macaroni fried with panko breadcrumbs. We decided to split two entrees.  Being that pizza is the namesake of the restaurant we went with the Pear and Gorgonzola Crispy Thin Crust Pizza.  Except it wasn't crispy.  At all.  Neither one of us really cared for it. The crust was topped with pears, caramelized onions and chopped hazelnuts then topped with field greens in a ranch sauce with Gorgonzola crumbles.  Not only was the crust not even close to being crispy, I think we counted about two pieces of hazelnuts.  The cold field green salad on top was mixed with too much dressing and wilted with the heat of the pizza.  This would be a horrible pizza to have to take home because of the hot pizza and the cold salad do not work well together- especially for leftovers.  We were so disappointed. The second entree we ordered was the Quinoa and Arugula Salad.  I love spicy arugula and it mixed well with asparagus, sun-dried tomatoes, red onions, pine nuts and quinoa.  Topped with Feta cheese and tossed with Champagne Vinaigrette, I thought this was a very unique and tasty salad. Our service was wonderful.  She handled herself very well as a table behind us had misunderstood the menu and blamed her.  Very professional. In all our meal was good.  However, when you call yourself a pizza kitchen I feel like it is the pizza that should be the most delicious item on your menu.  When you advertise a crispy crust and it comes out mushy, that is a major epic fail.  When you advertise hazelnuts on your pizza and there are only two tiny little pieces on the entire pizza, that too is not good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-3?start=20,3.32,3.32,3.32,3.0200000000000005,3.3200000000000003
69,Lorraine A.,"Orlando, FL",5,14,5.0,4.0,2013-12-29,"We arrived smack in the middle of dinner rush, but only had a 5 minute wait. The server was excellent and even gave us a discount because my husband is a firefighter (not many places do). I ordered the petite wedge salad. Not so petite, but excellent. I also ordered the mushroom and spinach flat bread. When the flat bread arrived, it was burned on the edges. The server looked a bit exasperated when she apologized and said that happens often with the flat breads. The taste was excellent in the beginning, but the overwhelming taste of salt took over once I got to the third piece. I'm sure this was because of the cheese, but I still felt the need to ding them for that and the burned edges. My husband enjoyed his arugula and asparagus salad as well as his sausage flat bread. He loves spicy foods and found the flat bread was good and spicy. He ate every bite.

26,David H.,"Silver Spring, MD",414,308,403.0,4.0,2014-01-14,"This is one of the few chain restaurants that I really do enjoy.   I always start with the California Cobb Salad with ranch dressing and always add the beets.  It consists of: Nueske's applewood smoked bacon, avocado, chicken, tomatoes, chopped egg, basil and Gorgonzola with housemade herb ranch or bleu cheese dressing. Option to add beets Do not forget to add the beets if you try this. It adds a nice nutty sweetness to each bite.  Really can't go wrong with any of their pizzas. They seem small, but with an appetizer or salad along with your pizza it is plenty of food.  I remember the first time I tried CPK it was in San Diego... like 14 years ago. It might have been because of the location.. but they had a Peking Duck Pizza.  Wish I could try that again.. doubt it though considering this is Orlando.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-3?start=40,3.36,3.36,3.36,3.152,3.3600000000000003

86,Jessica E.,"Orlando, FL",0,1,,1.0,2014-07-18,"After my experience today, I sent this letter in via their survey website, their main site, and their corporate site.  7/18/2014 To whom it may concern:  I have had a few poor experiences in a row with your restaurant located in the Mall at Millenia on Conroy.  Each time I had one or more of my children with me, and I wasn't sure if there was a correlation, but after today I am convinced there is. Let me start by describing my experience today to you.   I arrived at the restaurant at about 12:15 with my 5 year old son. We were seated right away. However, the greeter led us to a far corner, right next to the kitchen galley doors, where during the course of our time there, there was a constant stream of bus boys walking past with tubs of dirty dishes. Not the most appetizing of environments. I began to look around the restaurant and noticed empty tables in better locations throughout the restaurant. People that arrived after us were seated in them. None of them had kids. Looking around further, I noticed the only customers seated in a less desirable place than my son and I were was another mom with two children, seated right next to the bathrooms.   Our server came and took our drink order, and returned about 5 minutes later to take our food order, which I placed: a thai chicken pizza for me, a cheese pizza and a side of fruit for my son. We waited for our food for 40 minutes. In that time, I had finished my tea, and our server did not check on us once in that time frame. When he brought the food out, he noticed my empty glass and brought me another one. He did not return for another long stretch, when I then asked for boxes. My glass was empty again but the server apparently did not notice this as I was never offered or brought another refill. I received my boxes and check. During the wait for those things, I noticed who I assumed to be a manager walking around asking various tables how everything was. I was fully prepared to express myself in the restaurant to the manager, but she never came to my table. We paid and left. I declared to nobody in particular on the way out, since no one seemed to care how our experience was, that we were never, ever returning.   I have some suggestions on how you could improve your restaurant. I am not sure whether you train your greeters to marginalize families with children, or if animosity towards young families is a prerequisite for being hired, or if you believe that other customers don't want to be in the same vicinity as families with small kids, but clearly one of aforementioned must be true. I would suggest then that you remove your extensive and seemingly welcoming child's menu from the restaurant. Offering a multi-page paper menu with crayons and activities, with several food offerings, gives the impression that you welcome children when that is in stark contrast to how you treat families with children. I would also suggest you rethink the placement of your restaurant. It's in a mall. Where moms shop. With their kids. And you serve pizza. It would seem that this would be a perfect match for a ready-made customer base but my experience has shown that this particular restaurant (I can't speak to the whole chain) is not desirous of those kinds of customers.   Please be assured that if losing my business was your goal, you have achieved it. I will also make sure to tell all my friends who have small children to not burden you with their company.  Sincerely, Jessica Eggleston",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-3?start=60,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.8200000000000003,3.2800000000000002

67,Tairi P.,"Orlando, FL",311,104,175.0,4.0,2015-03-03,"So I have an obsession with the Smashed Pea & Barley soup here, which means if I'm at the Mall at Millenia, I'll usually stop here instead of the usual overly-salty food court offerings. This time when I came in, I waited at the host stand for almost 5 minutes before anyone bothered to walk up to greet me and find me a seat. (After 2 minutes I asked a server walking by if I could seat myself and they said no, so I just waited.) Fortunately that's where the negative part of my experience stops. What appeared to be the manager on duty came to greet me and find me a seat. As he did so, he asked if I was part of their loyalty program and I asked for a little more information. It's basically an email newsletter and free to sign up. However, he let me know this because they were having a special where you'd get a free appetizer if you signed up. I really appreciated this, as it saved me $5 I was going to spend anyway. My server was friendly and prompt, and I had the White Corn Guac and Chips to start with. It's DELICIOUS and vegan!

Our server was so fantastic and really very helpful with making suggestions. I decided to order a cup of the Sedona Tortilla soup and the Thai Crunch salad. I asked how big the portion size was for the salad and our server said it was huge and actually recommended I downsize to the half order as it would be more than enough for me.  I appreciated that tidbit because as soon as my half order came out, my eyes were as big as saucers! It was a giant heaping of salad and sooo good. I loved the ""crunch"" of the peanuts, wontons and rice sticks thrown in there too alongside the chicken, avocado and veggies. It will more than fill you up. I couldn't even finish it.   The soup was great too. It was a thicker sort of soup ...more like a puree?  Based on the service we received and the menu items I had, I would definitely come back and try something different.

It's a nice place and everything goes smoothly but it doesn't stand out in service or in the food like I remember from my Atlanta visits. Maybe it's the mall vibe.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-3,3.76,3.76,3.76,,3.76
9,Joseph G.,"Winter Garden, FL",134,101,53.0,2.0,2017-08-20,"Generic. Pretty slow service. I liked that they are trying to step up their food game but - though the lemongrass chicken and superfood bowl looked awesome - the taste fell flat. It certainly looked very delicious, but the chicken didn't taste particular fresh and was in fact a bit dry. We did have some drinks while there which were excellent. Their signature cocktails are indeed tasty, and also heavy handed in a great way. Conveniently located in the Mall at Millenia, so one you have finished your strong drinks, parting ways with your money is that much easier.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-3,3.68,3.68,3.68,,3.6800000000000006

I had a coupon for a small bites appetizer so opted for the buffalo cauliflower. Then I was torn beyond a pizza or a healthy Benhi Bowl. I did the bowl and wow it was good! I would recommend going here if you are in the Millenia Mall or in the area anyway. I have been here before and the pizzas are excellent! Manager on duty was friendly as well. A 5-star experince both times!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-3,3.72,3.72,3.72,,3.7200000000000006

16,Julia H.,"Winter Park, CO",59,5,,5.0,2017-09-30,"My husband and I went to California Pizza Kitchen on our first night in Orlando with my father in law and his friend. It was an overall great experience. What made it especially great was our server, Seth. He had such a friendly, positive attitude. He gave us great  menu suggestions and was super attentive in a non-overbearing way. He also was funny and we loved the ""calorie free"" bread and desserts! He made the dining experience very pleasurable. If you are at California Pizza Kitchen at the Mall of Millenia, be sure to ask for him!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-3,3.8,3.8,3.8,,3.8
5,Aimee B.,"Ocoee, FL",116,139,105.0,4.0,2017-10-12,"Have been here for lunch a few times.  The lunch service has been amazing each time we come and they are very attentive and quick.  I have ordered flat breads, salads, pastas, and entrees in my various visits.  I typically need some modifications to something on the menu and they are always willing to accommodate my requests.

12,Brenda R.,"Orlando, FL",52,86,1.0,1.0,2017-11-09,"I really didn't like it here. I came in with my boyfriend and friend, we got 2 creamy pasta with chicken and a bow. My creamy pasta was dull, it tasted off to me. The bowl my boyfriend got, his dressing wasn't great. The only good things we had were the drinks. I got the strawberry mango sparkler, my friend got mango iced tea and my boyfriend got the mango lemonade. The bread was also delicious. The waiter winked at my boyfriend, a big no for me, then the host said sorry as we were leaving, but kept smiling (very weird). Other than that, the pasta didn't go well with my stomach. I can now say that I won't be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-3,3.8,3.8,3.8,,3.8

3,Patricia G.,"Orlando, FL",272,373,716.0,4.0,2018-01-09,"If you're in the mood for pizza but rather sit down at a restaurant than at the busy food court then check this place out. While CPK is known for their pizzas it is not everything they have on the menu. They have a nice variety of pastas, salads and appetizers so not everyone in your party has to order a pizza. Also, the pizza sizes are good individual sizes. Some people can finish the whole thing and others (like me) can get the rest ""to-go."" Last time I visited I had the pepperoni pizza and the menu had an option to add truffle oil. As a truffle oil lover I was intrigued so I opted to try it. Mind blown. I never thought that truffle oil on a pepperoni pizza would be that amazing, although truffle oil is pretty amazing on whatever you try. Anyways, the menu does have a ton of different pizza options... calling all pineapple pizza lovers. My mom says they have a great Hawaiian pizza here. Casual and quick service, I've never had a bad experience here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando-3,3.8,3.8,3.8,,3.8
