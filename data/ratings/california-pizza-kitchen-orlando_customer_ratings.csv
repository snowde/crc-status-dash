You can sit at a booth or table inside as well as at the bar overlooking the kitchen for quick service or even outside with your dog!   Last night we shared a Full Caramelized Peach Salad with mixed greens, peaches, dried cranberries, gorgonzola, red onions, toasted pecans and a white balsalmic dressing - super YUM and a thin crust traditional/original BBQ Chicken Pizza.

35,Erin S.,"Winter Park, FL",8,65,2.0,4.0,2012-08-05,It was my first time at CPK yesterday.  I don't normally prefer pizza but I was taken by surprise when I took my first bite of a garlic chicken pizza. It was absolutely delicious! I also had the best strawberry lemonade I have ever had too! It was packed full of flavor and just enough tartness to not be over powering.  My only grip is that it's a little on the expensive side. I won't be able to afford coming here often. For around twelve dollars you get a rather small pizza. The drinks were about three buck so it all added up pretty fast. My friend and I had a dog with us so we sat outside. After not being noticed for a while I came in and alerted the hostess. She came back out with menus and told us our server should be with us soon. After 20mins an apologetic waitress came out and took our orders.  Despite the mess up the staff remained very friendly and even offered us free drinks. Overall it was a great environment with great food and would definitely recommend it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando?start=60,3.88,3.88,3.88,3.088,3.88

37,Curtis M.,"Orlando, FL",64,17,13.0,2.0,2013-07-23,"$70 Buys You Paper Napkins, Denim Clad Servers, and Sugar Ants Marching Across The Table?  Really?!? I have been eating at CPK for years.  Since the late 90's in Ft. Lauderdale when they first opened on 441.  Low lighting, button down black collar staff, linen napkins, black straws, white drink napkins with the CPK logo printed in brilliant yellow, the smell of wood from the stove filling the entire restaurant with a timeless aroma, all served to the state of elegance CPK's upscale dining experience warranted.  The Peking Duck pizza was a favorite, sadly no longer on the menu, of our family's outings. I moved and left for college at UCF and was overjoyed when they opened one at Waterford Lakes.  The restaurant was not quite as nice as the one I remembered from my hometown, but it was still just as good.  It used to be a sure thing for dates because finger foods like pizza mean neither party worries about manners and can focus more on each other.   Recently, I took my girlfriend there to give her the dining experience I remembered loving.  It was date night.  Knowing the price of the restaurant, I expected a certain level of class.  When you go to dinner, you pay not just for the food, but the dining experience.  I was raised that you dress appropriately to respect that ambiance.  To respect the food and the atmosphere.  And to show that same respect to the other patrons sharing the experience with you.  This time though, was a stark contrast to what I was expecting. We were seated in a booth between two others each of which were seated with couples on a similar date, each dressed appropriately for the situation and enjoying quiet dinner conversation.  My girl was seated to face the back of the restaurant, I was seated to face the entrance.  Our server arrived promptly, but was wearing jeans and a utilitarian style button shirt.  Something like you'd expect a server to wear at a low class steakhouse, not an upscale gourmet pizza restaurant.  She placed cutlery on the table and I noticed they were wrapped in paper napkins, not black linen.  The drinks were not placed on white coasters with the yellow CPK logo, but instead just a brown paper square.  The menu was not in a leather bound black sleeve and printed on brilliant white cardstock with the logo printed in brilliant yellow, but was just a laminated folded paper, stained with drippings from previous patrons.  She was polite and took our order, but was more mall attitude instead of professional. She brought the order and the food was much like I'd remembered so that was good, but then I watched as two tables away, two UCF students, wearing t-shirts and sweat pants, dumped a cup of ice water all over the floor, and proceeded to laugh hysterically while kicking ice around the floor with their flip flops.  The date seated between them and us, the girl became exasperated and the guy was pissed.  Considering what the meal cost, I completely understand.  It's supposed to be a class above Olive Garden, and they were acting like drunken 4am Denny's.  Why the manager didn't eject them, I'll never know.  But it was then that I looked around and saw, the restaurant had gone completely down hill.  I saw some patrons trying to give the place the level of respect it deserved, but very few adults.  Mostly, I saw too many college kids and most of them were underdressed.  At the minimum, the hostess should have separated the patrons between adults and daters, and plebeian masses.  It was a shame to see a place I'd once respected as an eatery turn to this.  Then I noticed our table was loose and falling away from the wall, tilting everything towards the aisle center floor.  And as I looked at the strange angle of the table I noticed a small parade of sugar ants marching across from the wall towards the edge of the booth.  I was in disbelief.  And then the bill came.  This whole debacle had cost me $70 with tip for two pizzas, drinks, salad and an appetizer.  $70.  $70 For paper napkins, and the amateur NHL two booths away.  For jean clad staff and raucous noise.  $70 for a parade of ants where we eat our food. It felt like I got sub par TGI Fridays, for twice the price.  Needless to say, I will not be returning anytime soon.  And it's sad.  The food at CPK is great, quite excellent in fact.  That has not changed.  But the experience and the atmosphere just do not reflect what that place costs.  Not anymore.  And if you think that you aren't paying for the experience when you go out to eat, well, think about this; how many wedding proposals happen at your local Denny's, and how many happened at Manuel's On The 28th.  Would you suit up for a $100 4 course meal, or a $5 grand slam?  I'll be returning when CPK returns to it's former glory.  Till then, if I get a craving for CPK, I'll hit my grocer's freezer section.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando?start=60,3.6,3.6,3.6,2.8240000000000003,3.6000000000000005

71,Jeff K.,"Orlando, FL",520,754,862.0,2.0,2013-11-18,"I don't know what happened here. I overheard a server telling the table next to us that at some point the restaurant came under new ownership, so maybe that has something to do with it. From the day this place opened (more years ago than I care to think about) until a couple of years ago, I loved this restaurant and ate here often.  My favorite pizza, the Thai Chicken Pizza, was always delicious.  I kept coming back to it, although over my many visits I did have just about every pizza on their menu. I stopped coming here a couple of years ago when I started really trying to eat healthier.  The pizzas are all more than 1,000 calories each, making them difficult to justify when you want to lose weight.  All the same, my cravings for the Thai Chicken Pizza never abated and after a long absence I decided to treat myself and come in for dinner. Of course, I ordered the Thai Chicken Pizza.  What I got was something else.  This was less of a pizza and more of a round flatbread with carrots and sprouts thrown on top.  What is this thing?! What little sauce (and even less cheese) was baked on to the crust tasted similar to the pizza I remember, but there was absolutely nothing to it.  Then they ramped up the carrots and sprouts on top. Maybe to give the illusion that the pizza is as big as it used to be?  It didn't work, obviously this thing is a shell of its former glory. And another thing happened that never happened during my previous visits -- I left hungry. Bring back my pizza and we'll talk.  Until then, I'm done with this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando?start=40,3.56,3.56,3.56,2.9200000000000004,3.5600000000000005
46,Vanda V.,"Orlando, FL",0,7,,1.0,2014-01-18,"The worst experience ever. racist receptionists. We arrived the store tonight somewhere around six. Two front desk receptionist asked us to wait for half an hour. since we had 8 people,  I understood there might not be a large table available. so we waited. after half an hour to 45 minutes, then we see ppl came in after us sat down, I don't mean one or two, but a few other groups of  8 to 10 people. They sat right down.  Are we transparent? We asked why, the receptionist did not explain the reason and asked us whether we can sit in 2 separate tables.  This is a very 'good' customer service of urs.  We came in, there was still a lot more small tables available, but when u threw the question to us, the area was full. why you want us to wait longer when you could make us just sat right down when we came? I just think the two receptionists were so irresponsible  and did not even bother to apologize when we deciced to leave for other dining place. Upset and  for the racist part,  it is true. The manager please go figure out what happened. Skin color is not the ultimate priority for whoever and should not be a reason why your restaurant made us wait forever. so lets do math here. 1 hour per person for nothing equates to 8 hours for 8 ppl. your restaurant obviously  did not compensate for the lost 8 hours. no with a sincere apology or a goodbye.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando?start=80,3.4,3.4,3.4,2.8840000000000003,3.4000000000000004

23,Chris C.,"Houston, TX",8,21,45.0,4.0,2014-04-05,"Over the years living in the Orlando area, I've definitely visited CPK multiple times. They offer a variety of dishes and types of food so it's good for going with a group of picky people. I'm currently a lacto-ovo vegetarian, so the number of options present for me to eat is one of the primary factors on whether I will return to a place or not. I love that CPK offers a separate menu online that lists which dishes are ""safe"" for me to eat. That takes a lot of the guess work in determining if a dish is meat-free or not. Overall, I always enjoy what I get at CPK. An order of the crispy Mac N Cheese is normally a must because who can resist cheesy-pasta that is deep fried? It has a good flavor, a soft inside, and nice crunchy outside. I normally get the white pizza or the roasted artichoke + spinach pizza. Both are delicious and offer an ""above average"" pizza for the Waterford lakes area. Although slightly pricier than other places in the area, I think its worth it due to the number of selections on the menu and the quality of their products.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando?start=60,3.44,3.44,3.44,3.3120000000000003,3.4400000000000004
95,Kay Y.,"Orlando, FL",353,253,1063.0,3.0,2014-04-28,"This CPK has been around here forever! Like another patron from the reviewer had said CPK is not what is use to be but at least the food is good.  It's much more of a casual dining restaurant than the 'upscale california' feel. They have cut back on a few items such as no bread, paper wrapped silverware, and no percent discounts with affiliate partners. I know what I like from CPK and i rarely deter from it. I always order the chicken and shrimp lettuce wrap and the sicilian thin crust pizza. Those are my two favorites.  The lettuce wrap has a asian flair which is made with stir fried diced chicken with small shrimp and a soy base dipping sauce. They give you half head of lettuce to wrap the goodies. The sicilian is so thin and crispy with all kinds of italian meats on there.  On that visit I've also tried one of their small plates as part of their special right now. We ordered the Shaved Mushroom and Spinach. It was good and tasty however if it weren't for the promo, I highly doubt I would try it. It was about $6 for 4 slices of a 6 inch flat bread. I think it's much more practical to buy a pizza with that. Especially for mushroom and spinach. Maybe it was a new marketing project to bring in more customers but its not something that I would try again. The service was friendly and helpful. We sat outside but they still came out and checked on us like we were regular customers (I know servers haaate going in and out..trust me) Finally, one good thing about this place is that they have a nice outdoor patio seating area which they have renovated by adding cushion benches and a firepit. It is a great place to bring you dog and they welcome them.  One bad thing about it is that they indeed have a sugar ant problem......",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando?start=20,3.4,3.4,3.4,3.2440000000000007,3.4000000000000004

Our server was wonderful. The hostess was very friendly. Alas, the cook messed up one of our entrees. That meal came out after the rest of the party was done eating. Our server was nice about it and apologized, but honestly, in that kind of situation a manager needs to come to the table and say something. And honestly, my expectation was that they would adjust our check in some way to compensate for the messed up meal. But none of that happened.  So, I'm probably not coming back here for a long time. I still love CPK's food, but I'll have to find another location to visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando?start=40,3.32,3.32,3.32,3.4640000000000004,3.3200000000000003

Definitely don't want to go to jail either for leaving kids in the car to pick up an order. I don't have that many arms and it's just too much.  I had a friend from out of town come over for a play date with her toddler. It was a Friday at noon. I went to pick up our order. My BIGGEST pet peeve is placing any kind of order and it not be complete when you come home and discover this annoyance. Now with screaming toddlers it's chaos and unspeakable. Literally no kids meal and half our order was missing. I won't lie -- we were pissed.  I called and got the Manager, Jamarie. She was so polite and offered to remake our food and comp our meal. She asked that I return in 15 min to pick up. After much thought and kids going crazy I called her back and told her to forget it because there was no possible way I could return. Just imagine (3) toddlers beyond the point of return on hunger looking at us like we are bad mothers as we fed them wheat thins -- it's scary.

It was good, but nothing out of the ordinary as far as this type of soup goes.  For my main course, I opted for the five cheese and tomato pizza.  The pizza tastes homemade with a crust that's crispy, yet soft in the right spots.  The cheeses made it ooey-gooey and the fresh tomato cut through the creamy cheese and lessened the guilt of eating the whole (small) pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando,3.84,3.84,3.84,3.7920000000000003,3.84

I've been to CPK millions of times in Miami and this is the first time I visited this location in Waterford Lakes. The location is great, it is only minutes from my complex but wow the food was just so so. I think for the price I would've rather have gone to Goodfella's for far superior pizza. The pizza here is overpriced considering the blahness of the pizza. Sadly the best thing about my meal was the free bread that comes with the olive oil, that was absolutely delicious. I also ordered a sangria flight which was overly sweet and a small plate of chips and guac. It pains me to pay $41.30 for my meal. My boyfriend and I ate our pizza (not all of it but most of it) because we have been up since 7 am and we've been moving so we were starving when we came but honestly I will probably never come again. I recommend Goodfella's for pizza it's only a few minutes away from this location if good pizza is what you're looking for. Now that I think of it, the Magerita CPK pizza you get in the frozen isle and bake yourself is far superior to the one I had today which is sad. I'm so sad to have disliked this so much because I've been a fan of CPK for years but I think my love for this place is done. *After posting this review I spoke to the manager and he listened to my complaints and was very nice about trying to figure out what the issue was.

I went with the personal sized BBQ pizza while my dining partner went with an entree' salad. The food arrived a bit more slowly than we would have anticipated but temperatures were appropriately hot and cold and was attractive. Portions were large and some diners may choose to split a pizza (or salad) along with an app (or two). We ended up with a 'to go"" container stuffed with much of the dinner salad. The restaurant was clean and attractive. At the same time, I continue to be amazed at the number of relatively dimly lit restaurants that incorporate ""reverse type"" and smaller fonts sizes on their menus. Such designs  might generate recognition for the creative staff but often alienates diners over age 40...or maybe less. All in all a nice experience led by our server and a tasty BBQ pizza.

2,Kara M.,"Orlando, FL",315,132,642.0,4.0,2017-07-28,"I adore this businesses food. My favorite item off their entire menu is the baked potato soup. My boyfriend and I order that and Farmers market soup  every time we go. I also like their flatbreads! They are amazing. My favorite is the spinach and mushroom flatbreads  Sometimes we dine in, most of the time we do take our and just recently we did the curb side.  I liked how convenient it was to just call in our order, park in the curb side parking and they will bring your food out. If you ask, sometimes they will give you bread with olive oil on the side. It's delicious .  Their take out usually takes a little longer than expected sometimes due to the crowd they have dining in, but they offer you waters while you sit at the bar next to the take out.

0,Douglas D.,"Orlando, FL",183,81,326.0,4.0,2017-08-20,Friday night date night and we decided to pick CPK for our love of pizza. We got there and were seated very quickly. They offer different speciality pizzas that come in  personal size. I ordered the Jamaican jerk pizza which is my favorite. It has enough spice to keep me satisfied and has a little sweetness that keeps you wanting more. The pizza comes cut in six slices and easy to share between 2 people. My gf ordered the Sicilian pizza which is also a favorite. Comes with all different types of meats and has a little bit of spiciness. All the flavors come together to form a great taste.  If you join their loyalty club it's easy to gain rewards. We had $10 and used it on the avocado egg rolls. The eggs rolls aren't that great compared to other restaurants. It comes with ranch dressing. The service was excellent and the vibe is casual throughout the restaurant. CPk is a local favorite. Pizzas are a little pricey but they do have excellent taste.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando,4.24,4.24,4.24,,4.24
16,Jeremy M.,"Jerome, MI",5,16,15.0,5.0,2017-09-08,"Hello once again from Orlando this is the California Pizza Kitchen over here by Waterford Lakes it is absolutely wonderful.  Everything from the pizza which I'm not even sure what it's called was fantastic it's the carne asada and it was to die for. In addition to the pizza we had fried macaroni and cheese which was really good the cheese sauce was excellent. They even remembered to bring us bread this time, which was one of my complaints on the last visit we had here. It was fresh and very hot still from the oven and it was great. The service here was excellent. We were greeted at the door by a young lady and she was very courteous and welcoming and she even smiled! Our server Marty was very professional did a great job and we even talked to the manager Jeff, who was very friendly and made sure that our experience here in California Pizza Kitchen was top-notch!   We appreciate it and will be coming back here more frequently.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando,4.32,4.32,4.32,,4.32
99,Paige G.,"Winter Park, FL",0,4,,5.0,2017-09-12,"Today was the day after Hurricane Irma hit and we decided to go to California Pizza Kitchen for lunch and to get out of the house. Even though they hadn't gotten new deliveries (because of the hurricane) they were still serving fresh food to an insane amount of people. Our server Mike was amazing and we spoke with the Assistant Manager for a bit (I can't remember her name but she was so so sweet) and she made sure we were served well. I ordered a soup that they were out of and they were so apologetic that they gave me a different meal of my choosing for free. I was in no way expecting this and would never in a million years ask an establishment to give me free food, so this came as a total surprise. With all the stress of the hurricane this particular California Pizza Kitchen completely made my day so much better. They also talked to all of us (we're younger college students) to make sure that we made it through the hurricane okay. Honestly the food was great as always and the service was legitimately the best service I have ever gotten when going out to eat. The people working here are so genuinely kind and they really care that everyone who eats there has a positive experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando?start=20,4.32,3.86,3.86,,4.0440000000000005

11,Destiny K.,"Orlando, FL",29,1,,2.0,2017-11-12,I need help here people! My sister and I ordered peach and mango mimosas! What I received was flavored champagne. As a frequent bruncher I KNOW that mimosas are comprised of champagne and orange juice--regardless of additional flavoring. When I asked my server she proceeded to tell me that other people may make their mimosas with orange juice but they don't. WAIT. WHAT?? It's like saying sorry we just done make out jack and coke with coke. Other people might do that but not us.... so can I please get some clarification? If that is not how you make your mimosas then you should advertise it as flavored champagne and not a mimosa. Overall she was pleasant and accommodated our request for orange juice but this is just not how a mimosa is made.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando,4.32,3.84,3.84,,4.032

Honestly the only good thing was the food and sangria. The service was terrible! Our waiter took 10 minutes to acknowledge us and ask us for our drink and food orders. I specifically asked to have my sangria come out when the food came out and instead it came out early. We also had to ask for straws and bread. I've been to other CPKs and had amazing service maybe he waiter was just having a bad night.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando,4.24,3.82,3.82,,3.9880000000000004
1,Shilley T.,"Casselberry, FL",257,241,1045.0,3.0,2017-12-31,"I love pizza! California Pizza Kitchen has decent pizza and other options for non pizza eaters(I don't even think it's possible not to like pizza).  My friend was having a farewell party and opted for this restaurant we were a large party and our waiter Tyler was amazing.  He was very patient with us and made sure we had everything we needed while dining.  Before getting our food I decided to try their sangria flight. Yes it was a flight with 3 different sangrias. The first one I tried was the traditional berry sangria not too sweet and quite refreshing. The second one was the orchard sangria which I was told was quite popular. I found it tasty but it wasn't my favorite. The third sangria was the beehive sangria which I liked a lot. The bartender told me it was the least popular because it was very sweet. It worked for me because I do have a sweet tooth. For dinner I ordered the three cheese pizza with tomatoes and fresh basil. I thought at first that I would have to take half of my food home but I ended up eating the whole pizza. My verdict is: when in doubt less is more. This pizza was a white pizza, the cheeses were a great balance and the basil made it epic.  My overall experience was great. The service was also awesome.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-orlando,4.2,3.82,3.82,,3.9720000000000004
