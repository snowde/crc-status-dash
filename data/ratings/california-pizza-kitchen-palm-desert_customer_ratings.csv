110,Jim C.,"Cathedral City, CA",63,468,257.0,1.0,2012-01-23,"My wife and I had a wholly un-inspiring visit here. I hate to bullet-point the place, but it really doesn't deserve my prose. * The booths for two (which we were seated in) are too small, especially if both people order a pizza. * This was the loudest restaurant I've been to in the Coachella Valley. It must have something to do with the acoustics of the place, because they weren't packed or anything, but I felt like our table was on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. * My wife's ""Spaghetini"" (if that's how it's spelled) was bland. I'm not sure why there was a ""tini"" on the end. It didn't come with a martinin, or anything. * The waiter warned me that my Habañero Cilantro pizza was really spicy, but that the really hot stuff comes on the side. Once our food came, I had to ask him to bring the sauce, as he had forgotten. The flavor of the pizza was passable, at best. * Did I mention that it was LOUD? * When we were done eating, we asked for 1) a glass of water, 2) a box for leftovers, 3) an accounting of a gift card (which had ~$7-$8 left on it), and 4) the check. What we received: 1) a box for leftovers, 2) a report that the gift card had a zero balance, along with an explanation that perhaps it had expired (huh? isn't that against the law?), and 3) someone else's check, sitting several tables away. We didn't expect the waiter to remember the water, so we weren't disappointed. * At the booth next to us, their avocado egg role appetizer was delivered as they were about half-way through their meal, along with an apology that they had ""run out."" With the plethora of pizza places scattered all over the Valley, there is no reason why anyone should subject themselves to CPK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palm-desert?start=140,2.5960000000000005,2.5960000000000005,2.5960000000000005,2.5960000000000005,2.5960000000000005
209,F M.,"Palm Springs, CA",23,9,,2.0,2012-01-26,"I ordered via online to this CPK. The process was actually quite easy. I like the fact that you can add or delete ingrediants specific to your taste. One HUGE problem, the customer service experience was horrid! After placing my order online, I realized I forgot to omit mayo on a sandwhich. When I called the phone number, they place me on hold for 3 minutes, then another person pick up the phone and would get the right person for me, I waited another 5 mintues, then it happened AGAIN! Needless to say, after waiting on hold for 13 minutes to speak to someone, I was pissed. I only wanted to make sure that they did not add any Mayo to the exisiting order I had placed. The lady before I spoke to the manager was a bit rude and apologized for them being busy and their golf cart delivery issues. I did not care. It was unprofessional and they need to be trained better to handle customer service issues like this. When my associate went to go pick up our order, guess what, there was MAYO on the sandwich!!  What a bunch of buffoons. I will never eat here again. If you do enjoy CPK, just be cautious when doing take out because they seem to be very disorganized and do not communicate with the kitchen. The only reason I gave 2 stars was for the online ordering that they have available. Good bye CPK!!!  I'm moving on to Z Pizza.

The food was pretty good.  Unfortunately I didn't tell the waitress not to toss my item so it came all mixed up.  Still, it was pretty good.  I really liked my wife's salad, but wasn't fond of the, ""dumplings"".  My wife's iced tea was always filled. The noise level at this visit was just below a jet engine.  The place has floor to ceiling windows on three sides allowing sound to ricochet around the room.

Tortilla soup was the consistency of mashed potatoes...held the bowl at a 90 degree angle and the soup didn't move. They must have been short on cheese because 2 of the 3 pizzas had little to no cheese. The kids each ordered a small Peporini pizza and they only brought one...waitress then decided that should would challenge us on the fact that we only ordered one not two. After the missing pizza came they delivered two more soups that we didn't order...sent them back of course. the best part was the kids Mac and cheese...should have ordered off the kids menu.

I haven't visited in over 10 years, but I don't ever remember loving it as much I as I did on my visit last Saturday. We went in for lunch and were pleasantly greeted by the staff and were well taken care of by our server, Sierra. She was fantastic!  We sat at a window table and shared the Creamy Pesto Penne w/ Sundried Tomatoes, and the 5-Cheese and Tomato Pizza. Both went beyond our expectations. The penne was creamy and flavorful and the sundried tomatoes were a wonderful compliment to the pesto. The pizza crust was done perfectly and the creaminess of the cheeses caused for a very satisfied diner.  The only complaint I could possibly give was that the restaurant was freezing cold, and it's impossible to sit anywhere that doesn't have an A/C vent above you. This just reminds me to bundle up for my next visit... And yes...

And it was an extra $7 charge! We weren't aware it would cost extra let alone a whole other drink. We each got this drink and it cost us between $27-32 for both. A bit ridiculous. I confronted her when we got the check and she said ""Well the substitute is a whole other alcohol so it's like ordering another drink but just mixed into one."" My reaction, ""Had we known this was the case, we would've just got the original and not your recommendation and then got the other drink as our second. So at least we are enjoying 2 drinks instead of one $16+ drink."" She didn't budge and I asked to talk to the manager. He sided with the server and we still paid.

All the staff eating and maybe 1-2 employee's actually working!  Most of the times we come there are only max 3 tables eating and one of them being employees. You would think they have time to serve you but they are never around to ask for things and get refills! No urgency... It feels like ALL the servers are new untrained young kids serving for the first time.  I love the menu and keep coming back for torture. My family eats out at ALL the restaurants at least 4 times a week here in Coachella Valley. We visit CPK at least once every 2 weeks but this time I waited almost a month and when we arrived today..... Some guy that I never met before said "" welcome back"" then the waitress who I have never met before said "" you are regulars!l Seems to me they have talked about my family and were prepared to screw us again! My first impression of the waitress was that she had it together!! And was beating me to my Questions.. Obviously she was schooled!!  We asked for bread since it wasn't offered and it has never been since they changed their policy at CPK. She returned with drinks and then said "" oh they are making a new batch of bread and it will be awhile."" We waited and waited and saw another waiter take bread to another table and then we waited and waited and finally grabbed another waiter and asked him.... He helped us and no waitress around for at least another 10min. Then our main course came out by a food runner and no waitress to get cheese, refills on drinks or extra sauce! No one around again then we saw the same waiter that helped us just minutes ago and asked him!!! He delivered everything we asked again!!  So at the end of another horrific visit, I went ahead and gave our assigned waitress a smaller tip and the remaining 20% to the other server who was attentive and more of a service than our own assigned waitress.  After many bad experiences here... I will NOT return and hope that a secret shopper will come though, a executive at corporate or someone that can make a change here.

Well, we were vacationing with the family on New Year's Eve and wanted to go out for dinner. We tried calling Cheesecake Factory, Olive Garden, Islands, etc, and they were all either closed or had an hour+ wait. I called CPK, and to our delight, I was told by the woman on the phone that ""no, we do not have any wait, and we'll be open our regular hours, we close at 10 pm."" It was 905 at this time. So all 15 of us got in our cars, loaded up all the kids, car seats, strollers, etc and went to CPK.  When we got to the front door, the doors were locked. There was only one party in the dining area, and the rest were all employees just staring at us. No one came to the door or even motioned to us. So I called the number again and it was the same lady that answered the phone. She said ""oh yeah, my GM called me right after you called and told me that we are going to close at 930."" I told her that that really sucks because we drove all the way out here with 4 cars and the kids are tired and starving, and she said ""oh come in and I'll give you free food vouchers."" I told her I wasn't interested and hung up. That was the worst customer service experience I have ever had. She tried justifying it that her GM didn't even let them know earlier and that it was just her second day back to work. She wasn't apologetic and didn't really care how that affected me and my family. She was just going on and on about how her GM didn't even give them a heads up.

I can't but help to continually ordering the Chicken Tequila Fehttuchini because it is just so different and extremely flavorful and even has a bit of a kick. Definitely a dish you will find no other place on earth, I am quite certain of this. Ron had the California Cobb Salad served on a platter, wow that was some portion!  Our waiter Israel was super pleasant and really on the ball with our table. He pays attention to the details which I can say so very few servers now a day really do not comprehend or have never been served by someone who does!  I ordered the Petite Wedge Salad which also was very good, but in my opinion what dinged CPK from a perfect experience and meal was the the food runner brought our main dish out before I could even take two bites out of my wedge! One thing that really irks me is running courses prematurely or running them too slow. Pay attention to the pace in which your patrons are eating, this will give you a clue when it is the right time to bring the next course or suggest dessert. This was not Israel's fault but the speed at which the kitchen and runners are working in team.  One word of advice I have is to be careful if you charge your meal; pay careful attention to your  bill for on it is a line right above the tip line to offer a donation to RoundUp4Charity.

When food came, they didn't give us silverware, so we asked for some. A blonde girl slammed silverware down in front of us and didn't even hand it out to each of us individually. It seemed that the bartenders there were more concerned about making drinks for the entire restaurant than helping the people around them.

He took our order and brought us bread, and then we didn't see him for a while. He didn't even bring out our food. Our drinks sat empty for a long time and it took about 5-10 more minutes after he asked if he wanted refills to actually bring the refills. There were about 10 workers and they cared more about having fun and joking with each other. They were standing around, joking, and counting their tips in front of all of us.  One customer had a baby and was upset that her food was taking too long and tried to leave and no one even care for her. It was sad to watch. The food didn't even taste that good.

78,Michele S.,"Los Angeles, CA",8,6,7.0,1.0,2017-06-18,"Tonight felt like a scene from a horror movie. We chose CPK like a safety blanket as our 3-hour commute then shopping extravaganza left us starving for some comfort food. Upon arriving we needed to remind the hostess that we were in fact a party of 3 adults and 2 children. She managed to forget and yet ask us any possible combination before showing us to the table (2 adults, 3 kids, etc). After getting the children settled we realized it was at least 15 minutes before being greeted by the wait staff. Since we had plenty of time, when our waitress showed up we were ready to place our order. Two kids cheese pizza, salad and two pasta dishes. Not customization or allergy request - should have been easy ask for the chefs. Two bread deliveries and 40 minutes later the waitress informed us the kitchen lost the order. Please remember I noted we had 2 children. They were becoming tired and hungry.  Stunned and hungry we then provided the order to the waitress for the SECOND time hoping the evening would be improved. The manager apologized, brought over some avocado egg rolls and promised a 10 minute meal delivery. Clock was officially at 1 hour 5 minutes.  Thirty five minutes later we were storming out of the restaurant after the waitress returned the THIRD time asking us what we ordered. It is completely unacceptable for the wait staff AND management to treat its customers this way when the issue could have easily been mitigated.  The easiest solution to preventing our misfortune was to simply deliver the food we asked for. The management took no responsibility to follow up to ensure the meal was delivered in tact. Delivering an appetizer and assuming the service has been recovered is not acceptable. The fact that we were so close to the kitchen means that there is little excuse for why the staff could not ensure we received our meal.  Two hours later and a dozen excuses more, we left with some food in hand after demanding it be made 'to-go' after scolding the manager and waitress. Words cannot express how furious and disappointed we are.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palm-desert,2.84,2.99,2.99,,2.9299999999999997

Ask our waiter what the status is on our pizza.  ""It'll be right out.""  Wait.  Wait.  No pizza.  Ask AGAIN!  Then finally after about a half hour finishing our salad, the pizza arrives.  Finish the pizza.  Waiter no where to be found to get our bill.  Really?!  Terrible service even when it wasn't very crowded.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palm-desert,2.72,3.0,3.0,,2.8880000000000003

Waitresses stop by to make sure you're doing okay every 5-10 minutes. Super thoughtful. Quick to bring anything extra you ask for. 5 cheese pizza is BOMB. Salads are crispy and fresh. The desserts all look delicious, but we were too full to order one because we got extra food on the house. That's right!

61,Raychelle S.,"La Quinta, CA",191,74,114.0,3.0,2017-08-28,"Exactly what my star rating means. A- OK. Here are the pros and cons of my dining experience at California Pizza Kitchen. The location and convenience. It is located on El Paseo towards the west end. This leaves for prime parking and walking to other shops around El Paseo if you want to walk off that pizza you just ate (Just saying because that is exactly what my mom and I did). Its easy to find and its surrounded by great shopping.  Inside. It is nice and welcoming inside. I also have to mention that the lighting is pretty decent. Just putting that in there if you wanted to capture the moment. It was clean and inviting. The bar area is secluded and away from the rest of the ""normal"" dining area. Note- for happy hour you have to be sitting in the bar area. Our waiter also mentioned that the happy hour is not out of this world. So pass.  Our service. Our waiter was accommodating, especially because we had a hungry baby sitting with us. She waited on our every request and was very nice. Also gave us great recommendations. The waiting time for our appetizers wasnt too bad. The waiting for the rest of our other food was longer than we anticipated. I get it though because it was a packed house...  The food. It was a okay. The appetizers we had were the spring rolls or something of the sort and they were pretty good. Though i dont know why people rave about the thai chicken pizza so much. We got that and I didnt like it very much. It wasnt what I was hoping for and I'd wish we tried something else. The ceseaer salad was okay but I dont expect it to be something out of this world. Everything was just ok. I'd go back if I had to but not for choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palm-desert,3.2,3.11,3.11,,3.146

Ive always loved the food at CPK but i must say i really go to this location because of the service and experience i get here. Theres some amazingly hard working individuals that make me return time and time again. Betty is so great if you want alot of interaction, shes always smiling and you really want to get to know her. Ashley gives amazing speedy service..again another smiling face. Karissa is such a rock star in the bar. Derek could be running the place and makes a killer drink. By the way the specialty drinks here are so interesting and fresh. Always something new to try. Taylor was a manager when i went in and man does that girl have spunk, so passionate about her career .i ordered curb side due to my 18 month old being in the car with me and nicole had it out to me in less than 5 min.

Pleasant waitstaff greet and seat you. Your drink order is taken and complementary bread is brought over with oil to dip.  Once food is ordered, it is brought out quickly and is so delicious. We particularly love the salads- the BBQ chicken and the Italian Chop to be specific. My mom and her husband frequent this restaurant and the pizzas and dinner entrees are also loved by them. I had a Moscow Mule- my favorite alcoholic drink- and it was pure perfection! It had a lime wedge and shaved ginger in it- what a fresh and flavorful twist. I highly recommend it.

They gave us our food for free, again today which is great but now that i think about it.. I've never paid for my food there BECAUSE THEY ARE ALWAYS SCREWING SOMETHING UP. It is more trouble than it's worth to deal with them. I RESEND my previous review and would not recommend them to anyone.
