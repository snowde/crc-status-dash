The Palm Springs location has ample outdoor seating that overlooks Palm Canyon Drive, and the servers are seemingly always in a fantastic mood. Cute people work there too... just sayin' The great part about this Palm Springs location, it seems, is the familiarity with so many of the customers. As regulars, they know us by name, know what we like to eat, and do their best to work with our routine. Sometimes the new trainees take some time to adjust, but CPK has this magical way of training employees so that they catch on amazingly fast. When I went to Taipei they opened a CPK right next to Taipei 101, and I brought friends in there as often as possible. It was one of the few places in that big foreign city that offered delicious gourmet pizza, large delicious salads (salad is pretty much IMPOSSIBLE to find in Taipei), inexpensive wines by the glass, and smiled when they served our food. Visiting the CPK in Taiwan made me terribly homesick, I always enjoyed that little slice of California sun when far from home. Now that I'm back, I visit the Palm Springs location all the time. I have just been informed that starting this month, they will offer a brand new Brussel Sprouts, Bacon and Ricotta cheese pizza, as well as a new Beets, Arugula and Goat Cheese salad!!! Yaaay~!! the salad sounds great, and is right on par with current California food trends. Brussel sprouts, too, never seem to get enough credit for being an amazing vegetable. As long as they're not boiled or steamed, brussel sprouts are damn good. I can't wait to try this pizza!
