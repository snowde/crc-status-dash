207,Karen C.,"San Francisco, CA",257,163,3.0,1.0,2012-01-05,"At any CPK, I always order the tomato basil spaghettini with grilled chicken. This place has got to be the worst I've tasted. The spaghettini was good, correctly cooked and seasoned however the grilled chicken-omg, the chicken was so salty. I couldn't even mask the salt when I combined it with the spaghetti in one mouthful.  As for the service, the waitress didn't come by our table once in between the time she gave us our check and the times she came to get our orders and give us our drinks.  Lastly, the cherry limeade I ordered was way too sweet. I've never had it before but I'm pretty sure something like what I had isn't supposed to be on the menu. Either everyone in Palo Alto likes their food overly salted and overly sugared or the chef/bartender here has too heavy of a hand with the seaoning.

134,Matt V.,"Sunnyvale, CA",672,313,59.0,3.0,2012-01-31,"This is a California Pizza Kitchen ASAP. I'm not sure exactly what that means, but I can tell you the differences that I've observed. The biggest difference is that instead of being a sit-down restaurant where you're served by wait staff, they have you start by ordering at the counter. You're given a number that you leave on your table, and they'll find you and drop off your pizza. I guess that makes it ASAP? Dunno. Whatevs. Service has always been fine. My pizza has come out quickly, and people are friendly. As for the taste, California Pizza Kitchen is decent, but there's better pizza out there. What I do like about it, and what would be the only reason for me to go there, is their creativity with toppings and combinations that other pizza places don't typically do. I also like their honey-wheat whole-grain option for the crust. A couple of my favorite flavors are the pear and gorgonzola, and the white pizza with applewood bacon. The pear and gorgonzola is just delightful. The sweetness of the pairs is balanced with the sharpness of the gorgonzola cheese. I also do like these kinds of flavors, that just make your taste buds dance. The white pizza is a bit milder; it comes with sauteed garlic spinach along with five different types of cheese: mozzarella, fontina, parmesan, ricotta, and pecorino romano. I've never been one to protest several different types of cheeses, but as you can see, the cheeses are much milder than the gorgonzola on the other pizza! I like ordering this one with applewood bacon tossed on it; the saltiness of the bacon adds a bit more flavor to the pie. Those are a couple of my favorites, although in general, I tend to avoid California Pizza Kitchen. There are definitely better options from local pizza places.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palo-alto-3?start=180,3.24,3.24,3.24,3.0520000000000005,3.2400000000000007

Wrong. Not only was the pizza slightly lower-quality than one would expect for a restaurant at this price point, but I think that the $5 frozen variety (with the same name) from Safeway actually tastes better. The restaurant looked nice.  However, it was extremely crowded.  As a result, the staff seemed a bit...frazzled...by the amount of people.  We were finally seated after 40 minutes.  We quickly ordered our food and drinks.  Yet, ironically, we had to wait another hour before we received our meal.  The irony was that our food was cold when it was served.  The waitress wasn't even apologetic.   Oddly enough, we discovered that we had been overcharged for our tab when we arrived home.  It seems like the waitress accidentally added someone else's set of drinks to our bill.  Go figure. For the price of our meal (about $50 with food, drinks and tip), we should have opted for a more trusted establishment.  The next time that we are visiting the Stanford Shopping Center, we'll probably eat at THE MELT.  It is much less expensive and the food is better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palo-alto-3?start=100,3.36,3.3,3.3,2.8880000000000003,3.3240000000000003

I now come here at least once a month and am never disappointed with the food and the service. I am addicted to their avocado club egg rolls, filled with chicken, bacon, cheese and avocado... they are crispy on the outside and super delicious on the inside. They give you 6 large egg rolls cut in half (so 6 pieces) which is generous for an appetizer plate. I also love their crispy thin crust pizzas, especially the roasted artichoke and spinach. I can pretty much finish the whole thing on my own. I used to always get the Tostada pizza but now that they only serve it on thin crust, it's not the same and I don't like it as much. Finally their 2 in a bowl soup is great (Sedona Tortilla Soup + Split Pea). I thought it would be weird but they go together perfectly and both are delicious. If you want bread and butter w/ your soup you have to ask for it. They used to give you bread & butter automatically but I see they have stopped doing that. Service is always friendly and quick.

299,Blue B.,"Palo Alto, CA",3,50,56.0,4.0,2013-10-01,"This is my typical family get-together restaurant. I've dined here ever since I was born and it always tastes better every time we come. We're never disappointed with the service or food.  My family's traditional order is 1 Large Wild Mushroom Pizza, 1 Medium Field Greens Salad, and 2 traditional cheese kids menu pizzas. Recently they have all been slightly altered. The original Wild Mushroom Pizza had their mushrooms wet and soggy. (Yes it does not sound too appetizing, but it actually tastes better since the mushrooms are easier to chew) The pizza wasn't too thin, and the dough was slightly sweet. Now they have changed the recipe so that the mushrooms don't get to be boiled, instead they are thrown onto the pizza, dry. The crust is also harder and not really sweet. The Field Greens Salad Dish was a salad with a variety of greens and leaves of all colors.  My family tradition was to exchange the chicken for shrimp and add extra walnuts. The walnuts were sugar coated which made them delightful to eat, and there were also apple slices. Together the salad tasted sweet, a tad bit sour (from the apples) and salty too. The texture was soft from the salad, chewy from the shrimp, and hard from the walnuts all at the same time. Now they have modified the salad to have goat chees mixed in, and to take out the apples. It changed the texture and flavors a ton, and it's no longer one of our favorite dishes, but we still order it for old time's sake. The kids cheese pizza was and still is just plain cheese pizza but smaller, with a sweeter thicker but softer crust. The only changes that have been made is that the dough is now thinner, and the pizza is cut into smaller pieces.   Overall still one of my favorite places to be. The staffs have always been polite and joyful when they're serving. The aura is always pleasant at CPK.

We don't think the chicken tastes fresh, it's like the chicken they put on your pizza.  The salads are chopped too much for us.  We will get a small plate like guacamole and chips if we're really hungry.  We tried most of the appetizers at one time, but we like  the appetizers at Cheesecake factory better.  The kids may get a ice cream sundae with m & m's and we like the butter cake with ice cream and whip cream.  It's a small cake that has a harder outside crust with sugar and it's buttery tasting in the middle which goes good with ice cream.

After placing my order, she reassured me that it'll be ready for pick-up around the time I requested. Three hours later (on my lunch break) I dropped in to pick up my phone order, and I was grateful that they had my order ready for me, BUT I glanced down at the half Thai crunch salad that I had ordered and I see avocado slices everywhere. I was so upset, because they had plenty of time to prepare one half salad w/ no complicated requests but to simply sub out the avocado's for grilled chicken. There were three girls standing near the register, giggling and discussing their weekend plans & completely ignoring me while I was trying to get someone to help me. I informed the girl that brought me my order that I didn't want the avocado's. She grabbed the salad & dashed off without saying a word. By this time, I was already ticked off.

The crowd was pretty heavy and we chose to eat at the right end of the counter, where we had a great view of the ovens baking the pizzas and crusty bread loafs, the meals coming out and being finished for serving. What became apparent is that this is a hard working team that were actively serving all the dishes for the rest of the dining room.

On 4/12/15, however, we had the most unpleasant experience with CPK stanford of my life.  We arrived at the CPK at 1:30 and was told to put down our names and the wait time would be 15 mins. We sat by the front desk and waited patiently. At 2:10, I saw parties that arrived much much later than us were getting seated and went to the front desk and asked about our table.  The girl calling the parties misspelled our name, but never called  even the misspelled name, and skipped our table. So 15 parties after us got seated, and we were still sitting next to her waiting to be called.  This girl with heavy eye makeup offered no apology whatsoever, and when the server (manager?) came to lead us to our table, she immediately started bad mouthing us in front of her coworker and other customers loudly--to the point that I can hear her calling us out!!! This is the most disgusting experience I have ever had in any restaurant, including fast food chains. CPK stanford -- your customer service training is appallingly inadequate, and your front desk staff needs an attitude adjustment. I don't believe I have the appetite to return to CPK ever again.  I had some good times at CPK, but won't miss them. When I see the palm tree logo of yours, all I can think of is that you hire people who are mean, rude, and unapologetic. Too bad.

We the lettuce was hard to nibble, the salad was dry with uneven cut of chicken, no taste, their mango lemon drink wasnt mango taste, they just added yelllow orange to make it look like mango, basically the issue was the salad could have been worth the price .. You can even find 6.99 salad from groceries that taste much better than California Pizza's 11.99-15.99 salad which is bland hard and dry... Their overpricing menu is not worth it... They shld just stick with pizza selection if they can't meet other standards... You can also see 3 other tables with left over plates, goes to show different customers fr diff tables also left unsatisfied...We did not leave a tip.. we werent served better, food was poor , reception was a fail, unhappy customers = no tip If this salad represents the whole place, I don't know how they can still stay in business",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palo-alto-3?start=60,3.4,3.28,3.28,2.148,3.3280000000000003

128,Alyssa W.,"Sunnyvale, CA",1,17,1.0,1.0,2015-12-02,"Normally, I would never write a review about this chain but this one evening was just horrible so I've decided to write about it. Two Saturday nights ago, my best friend and I came to this location for dinner. As well as to catch up. We walked in and the waiting area was over crowded of people waiting for a table. I walked up and put my name in, I was told it would be a 45 minute wait to sit inside. Agreeing, I looked around at the bar but there were only scattered empty seats. We waited aimlessly at the bar but it seemed no one wanted to move. My friend and I walked back to the waiting area where the hostess was trying to get people to eat outside in 50 degree weather. Even with heat lamps most turned her down. While I was waiting I almost slipped on their sticky floor twice and to be honest someone should have cleaned that. It's a hazard and if I would have fallen I would've be a happy campier. Still waiting for our table my friend and I could tell that the hostess was over worked and hadn't had a break. I truly felt sorry for her, you could tell she was overworked and needed someone to relieve her for a break. Finally, forty minutes later we were seated at a table. We waited five minutes which wasn't bad and a woman came to take our order for drinks. The waitress informed us that a gentleman would be taking over our table for her. The waiter came back with our drinks then we asked for a minute to order. As we still trying to make a decision with our order a couple gets seated two tables from us. The young man comes back and we order. Moments later he comes back with bread then leans across the table and starts discussing my friends tattoos. She was sweet enough to tell him then he kept staring at her. Just as he left, I saw the manager call him over and yell at him. Apparently, while he was flirting with my friend the couple two tables left in disgust. Now, I work in customer service myself and there is one thing you never do is yell at someone on the floor. Feeling a bit uncomfortable, I finish eating my bread and my friend stack our plates to let him know we're done with the bread. My friend asked for more so he went back for more. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw him come out of the kitchen with the bread. He drops a piece and kicks it to the side. Seriously? Come on! That's another hazard because someone could slip on it and fall. Our waiter comes back and give us back our dirty plates. No offense but he could have asked us if we wanted to use them before taking them or brought us new ones. Gross!! Thank goodness, our food finally comes and we start to finally enjoy. By the end of the end, I'm happy to get out of there. Never in my life have I experienced service so bad there. First of all that place needs more seating inside for cold days/nights such as that. Second, I thought the service was a bloody joke. I will not be returning to this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palo-alto-3?start=180,3.28,3.24,3.24,2.308,3.2560000000000007

I had to waste another 20 minutes driving back to get the entrees that should have been included in the first place, especially given the ridiculous amount of time that was had in getting it to me correct. Outside of my own experience tonight, the takeout line was full of angry people, including a woman who was way overcharged for her order and had waited a ridiculously long time for it as well.

I don't even know how they could manage that. The water was never refilled. Our waitress Gloria just seemed like she didn't really care. She acted like she did to our faces but when she turned around, I think she probably made faces at us. We were never rude because I don't believe in that but more challenging: Her: ""Sorry, we are out of bread"" Me: ""really because I see people getting bread"" Her: ""Oh it just came out of the over"".  Me: ""SHouldn't mu salad have shaved parmesan"", Her,""Yes"". Me: ""Well, then can I have it because this doesn't have it."" Her: ""Ok"" 10 minutes later, no parmesan.  That sort of thing. Now I know why I rarely eat at CPK. The manager was nice but clueless as to how poorly his staff was at serving people because he came to see how things were and he had to have known because we didn't see him go to anyone else and yet when I said,""Not great"" he was like,""Really?"" all surprised. I said,""Well that must be why you came by"" and he said ""no"" but I truly think that is why he came by because as I said, I didn't see him go to any other tables.

My friend had the spaghetti with bolognese sauce. She said it was good because she was hungry, but once she was full, it wasn't anything to write home about.  I had the lunch combo ($11) - salad and 7"" mushroom, sausage & pepperoni pizza which I think if fair for an average lunch without stuffing yourself. Everything tasted fine, I do wish I could get more croutons, I got TWO. Is there complementary bread and dipping oil? It seemed like everyone around us was getting it but us! I love bread and butter.  Service was above all alright. At the end of lunch, I requested for a small box and forgot to ask for the bill. We had to ask for the bill after the box arrived.

Today I ordered ""dine in"" instead of take out, because I wanted to have somewhere to sit during my break since there was no room at work, plus the quality of food seems to be better with restaurants when you have it there versus taking it to go. Anyways, I get there and the hostess was sweet but had no idea what I meant when I told her I ordered ""dine in"" from online. I then proceeded to the take out area who gave me my food all packaged up to go and told me I had ordered take out. I am very irritated because I was already unhappy with my last experience, and now I have no where to relax and enjoy my food and it's going to be poorer quality because they prepared it as to go. I just left and decided to find somewhere else outside. I opened my food, which I wish I had checked before leaving, to find exactly what I had not wanted. The cedar plank salmon looked and tasted dry, they did not give me the lime that it comes with, and did not include feta cheese on the corn succatosh...it was literally just corn and spinach, and from ordering it before when I actually had dined in, I'm pretty sure there was more to it.

I particularly enjoy this location because it is at the Stanford Shopping Center, it's very close to my job, the customer service here is amazing and the food is always on point. This locations seems to always be crowded and busy no matter what time or what day, the patio dining area seems to be extremely popular with people on nice days and it is more ideal dining on the patio than inside since the interior can get a little crammed and hectic. While they are known for their pizza with the BBQ Chicken Pizza being their most popular one, their menu is quite interesting and I definitely come here for other items. The pizza here is good, my favorite is the pepperoni since I'm very simple and plain when it come to pizza. Their crust is nice and crispy and chewy and has a bit of a sweetness to it and that's why I fell in love with the pizza. It's just different. I really love their spinach and artichoke dip as well, it's hands down the best I've ever had and a lot of the times I will do just to have that along with their hot bread and that can be a meal in itself. I'm a big pasta person so of course I've tried some of their pasta dishes which are very good as well, I particularly am a fan of the Garlic Cream Fettuccine  (   ). The sauce is very garlicky but not overpowering and it's one of the better pastas on the menu along with the Jambalaya Fettuccine.  The also have lunch duos which I find myself ordering more often, you can get a 7'' pizza and salad or soup and salad for no more than $10. It's just enough food and good for the price. Their salads and soups are yummy here as well, they have a new soup the Baked Potato soup and it is very creamy with nice chunks of potato topped with crisp bacon and scallions. This is my new fav soup, I'm a sucker for any type of potato soup. CPK definitely is a great restaurant and they have a lot of variety as far as their menu goes so you are not restricted to just pizza, they some good deals and great service. Oh and dessert if you don't remember anything try the butter cake and the Red Velvet Cake  (   ), both are very good.

I asked her what sizes the pizzas were because I've never been there before. She gave me as exasperated look as if I had offended her and told me they have kids size, regular crust, and thin crust. I asked what size would be good for two people and she repeated the above statement. I asked if there was actually a difference in those pizza sizes and she repeated the above statement. Look, I know it's late and 20 minutes before you close, but I'm not having trouble hearing your only answer and your attitude is appalling. Not wanting to talk to her anymore, I ordered a pizza and she put in the order and walked away. At this point, I realized she never answered my original question of shat size would be good for two people, so I flag down someone and ask if one pizza would be enough for two people. The guy says yes, so I leave it at that. 20 minutes later, I get my pizza and it is TINY. Maybe enough for two children to split, but definitely NOT two full grown adults. What the hell, CPK?! I was more than willing to buy a second pizza, just be honest about your pizza sizes! When I explained this to the guy who told me one pizza would be enough to split, he just shrugged and asked if I wanted bread on the side to go. No I don't want bread to fill up on!

It's very clear that senior executives/CEO of this organization is way out of touch of how the locations...and from the look, lack of cleanliness of the place, and attitude of the staff...they probably run the organization on reports from middle management only.  1. Upon entering we were not greeted in a manner consistent with the standard, ""Hello. Welcome to California Kitchen. How many are in your party?"" It was just a ""how many?"" 2. Even during that exchange, the manner on duty jumped and said table 48 is open. I then asked if they had a full liquor license. To which they do.  3. Our waitress, God bless her heart...did the best she could. She didn't ask if I wanted a salad with my meal. She just took the order and moved on.  4. Our food was not brought together. My friend got his salad first. 15 minutes later he got his pizza. 20 minutes later I got my steak... which sat in the service area for like 5 minutes of that 20 before the waitress brought it to me. 5.

15,Danny K.,"Palo Alto, CA",4,17,15.0,1.0,2017-07-27,"My wife and I used love the now closed CPK store on Cowper St., so after a while traveling we somehow had a yearning for, in her case, the Wild Mushroom Pizza and in mine the Sicilian. So we decided to give the store at Stanford Shopping Center a try. When we arrived they told us the wait would be 20 mins. We were happy when it was only about 10. After seating water and bread was dropped promptly. Soon after our server arrived. So far, so good. We ordered a bottle of wine, an appetizer, and two pizzas. MINUS ONE STAR: After about 15mins of enjoying bread and water we asked our server what happened our wine. She apologized and came back to the table and dumped (yes dumped) the wine and two glasses and walked off.  MINUS TWO STARS: So after a very long wait our pizzas arrived, we remarked to the servers that, well, we had not had our appetizer... They kinda shrugged... MINUS THREE STARS: Our appetizer arrives. My wife's pizza was cold so we swap her pizza for the Shrimp Lettuce Cups... We are at this point a bit disgruntled, but rolling with the punches. MINUS FOUR STARS: My wife excuses herself (to go to the bathroom -- figure out why here); the Shrimp lettuce cups have ""meat"" in them; she does not eat meat.  MINUS FIVE STARS: I call the server over and point out that the Shrimp lettuce cups have ""meat"" = ""chicken"" in them. She disbelieves me and checks with the kitchen. She comes back and assures me there is no chicken in what we have been served and my wife is mistaken. i dig around in the mixture, produce a piece of chicken meat and confirm by eating it in front of her that it is, indeed, chicken. I ask for a manager. MINUS SIX STARS: A manager comes out to deliver my wife's now warm pizza; It's the same pizza from before desiccated to point where when she picks up a slice it falls apart. MINUS SEVEN STARS: Manager shows us the underside of the pizza and argues since it is not black the pizza is not burnt. We cancel the mushroom pizza and the manager offers us free dessert. MINUS EIGHT STARS: We really don't want dessert, but I worked for years in the hospitality industry so I know it is important to allow a reasonable way of making good. We chose the salted caramel pudding. They must have taken one from the wrong side of the fridge (the ones to be chilled for tomorrow); it was a sloppy runny mess. At this point we just gave up. They comped the cancelled pizza, the lettuce cups and the dessert... So I might have given then a pass, but seriously a server arguing about the content of a dish? Lucky for my wife it's just she does not eat meat... If she had an allergy?

Amy please ask your main manager to train you better &  maybe take a course on  how to treat people  properly i can only imagine how you treat the employees",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palo-alto-3,2.52,2.72,3.06,,2.64
16,Boo B.,"Mountain View, CA",18,17,,2.0,2017-12-29,"This review is all about convenience.  CPK at this location is not baby friendly at all. They ask you to leave the stroller outside at the front, but they aren't responsible for it if it is stolen. We have a infant in his car seat. For that reason, there is a extra wait time. I wonder why. The stuffs at the reception wasn't able to explain.  We are meeting friends here. I will see if my stroller is still there when we are done.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palo-alto-3,2.56,2.7,3.056,,2.644

The original BBQ chicken pizza and the California Veggie are the best (at least they are my favorite ones). I have had pizza at other places but this pizza kitchen does it right, probably too good for a chain restaurant. They put enough of everything on it that makes it outrageously good. I always enjoy my time at the California Pizza Kitchen and it's my new best spot to be. I can see it being for a long time to come! Service can be a little frustrating but the great food makes you forget all the bad!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-palo-alto-3,2.68,2.73,3.06,,2.71
