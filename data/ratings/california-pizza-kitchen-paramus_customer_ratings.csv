83,Harvey A.,"Lyndhurst, NJ",254,207,336.0,4.0,2012-04-18,"Stopped here today for a quick bite that would be kinda nutritious. Sat at the counter and ordered a cup of the pea and barley soup. I like pea soup. I mean, I really like pea soup. This is a good one. I think it's a veggie version because there's no hint of ham or any meat in it. Still good and hearty though.  The half Thai Chicken salad was fun, and that's what I was looking for: a healthy fun salad. Lots of nuts, rice noodles, fresh greens, chicken, edamame beans and crunch. They charge $2.50 for about half an avacado added. I went for it and it was a good quality addition. Very good salad size for a half salad. I was stuffed and content.

121,Kelly M.,"Closter, NJ",52,177,,2.0,2012-06-05,We waited about 30 minutes for a table and the hostesses were super confusing about when our table was ready.  After being told you're up you are asked to stand in a line and seated in that order.  The place is tiny and our table was very crowded - so much so that I worried that others walking by would knock down our soda.  The pizza was just ok - plenty to share or take home - but pricey for what you get.  The waitress was on top of things and brought up multiple refills but then never came back with my wrapped up pizza to take home.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-paramus?start=120,3.32,3.32,3.32,2.9520000000000004,3.3200000000000003
80,Nicole L.,"Philadelphia, PA",262,493,33.0,2.0,2012-06-12,"Don't know what the heck was going on last Saturday, but honestly, I really don't care either. I will say that the entire experience is A LOT worse during the dinner rush at 7 in the evening than at 4 pm.  First off, the beeping guest pager was not working right (Haha, unintentional pun on ""beeping""). It would beep when I was more than 5 steps from the entrance, even though the hostess assured me that it works all the way down the hall.  The hostess who sat us made this HUGE fuss about how we didn't specify that we needed a highchair when we first put our names down, even though we have NEVER been asked about it that early. I think it's completely unprofessional to blame US for this. She put the three of us into a booth that would have fit 6 people (the only bright spot of the experience), and said that a highchair wouldn't fit, but they have a booster seat available (which worked fine). The usual crayons and paper menu was also provided. The server was nice, and we quickly ordered a milk for the little one and just some ice waters for us. We tried out the hawaiian pizza (even though it's not our usual order) and I got a BBQ chicken chopped salad (as usual). We also thought we'd try out the mac and cheese on the kid's menu to keep our little one occupied.  The food was really disappointing.  I was confused at how small my salad looked, and when I was finally able to flag down the server and asked about it, she said that she ""thought you ordered the half size."" At that point, I realized that unlike my other times, she did not ask me what size salad I would like, and I was too busy trying to save the table top from being drawn on to have noticed. She DID offer to switch my salad to a full sized one, but I was SO hungry and it took such a long time to flag my server down that I was just like... whatever. This was my choice, one that I bitterly regret, to this day. My husband's pizza was RIDICULOUSLY small. I mean... Other $14 pizzas are hanging off the side of the plate, and his didn't even make it to the inside rim. It was at least 2 inches (which in a circle is a big deal) smaller than the other pizzas we saw coming out of the kitchen. I don't know what the hell happened but quality control was completely lacking that day. The taste was only OK, since we tried something new, and didn't like it, I would have liked to ask the server to change it for our usual order (per their menu suggesting that we try something new)... but again, not being able to find your server just means that the kitchen will get less complaints (as most of us just throw up our hands and say ""screw it""), and more bad Yelp reviews.  The mac and cheese was absolutely atrocious. The pasta was cooked a bit under, which is OK if you're an adult as some people like that, but less acceptable when it's for a very young kid (and a baby, none-the-less).  Maybe next time, we need to specify that the pasta be fully cooked, but I would have thought that to be obvious. Also, there was SO little cheese sauce, that it was just a macaroni dish. When we were finally able to find our server, we asked for more cheese sauce, and granted, she was good about bringing that. But again, not sure what was going on that day. At least their private bathrooms had a changing table, which I did appreciate (and use). Overall, this was an extremely disappointing meal and I will not be coming back to this location. I've had very good experiences at the Willowbrook Mall location, and will head out there from now on when the craving hits.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-paramus?start=100,3.24,3.24,3.24,3.0160000000000005,3.2400000000000007

As I was saying, California style pizza isn't amazing in my honest opinion.  This place has some decent beer, a better wine list, and a non pizza menu that is pretty good.  This place can get packed on the weekend and I usually see people eating the pizza.  Not sure why because the rest of the food is much better.  It's a thin crust style, but the crust itself doesn't have that crisp texture of the right taste.  Cheese and sauce aren't anything super flavorful either.  Flavor profiles like California Club or Habanero Carnitas aren't really pizza, they're pizza shaped, but certainly not pizza.  Better alternatives are things like the Fire-Roasted Chile Relleno or Jambalaya Fettuccine.   Bottom Line: The pizza is MEH.  The rest of the food isn't bad and the wine is good (Although a tad overpriced).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-paramus?start=100,3.4,3.4,3.4,3.308,3.4000000000000004

69,Carol S.,"Woodbridge Township, NJ",87,65,67.0,4.0,2014-01-31,"My friend's mother wanted to eat out with me. WIthout my friend. Yes it was a little strange hahah. But it was a Thursday for party of 2. At CPK, you can call ahead 30 minutes to put your name on the waiting list though they don't necessarily reserve. I called ahead for 5:45 PM but when we got there, there were a plenty of empty tables. The traffic around the area at that time is an absolutely pain as everyone heads home for work or out for dinner, so you can expect the mall parking to be kind of horrendous too. Oh that's another thing, it's actually inside the mall, not like one of those restaurants that have a direct outside entrance. We were able to get a free Small Plate by registering with the CPK app on my smartphone. Jessica, our server, was quick to take down my account number and immediately put it into the system (grateful! I read about how much of a hassle getting this free small plate was at some CPKs). We got the White Corn Guacamole & Chips. Came out in a matter of 2 minutes-- awesome!! The amount of guac they give you is about 3 tablespoons. A lot less than we expected for the amount of chips we got. However, good and I s'pose it is afterall just an appetizer. I just think they should portion the ratio better. We ordered the California Club and the Kung Pao Spaghetti, both to share. When Jessica took our orders, she reassured us that they were great selections! Especially being a first time visitor. We waited about ten minutes and Jessica refilled out waters in between. Food came out. Though the California Club didn't have that zangy tangy kick I was looking for like in a BBQ pizza, and appeared rather unappetizing because it looks like a salad on top of a pizza, I actually enjoyed it! It did not feel like a guilt-heavy pizza. There were pieces of bacon throughout and the lemon-pepper mayonnaise was the most flavorful. I don't think I'd get it again though. The KUNG PAO SPAGHETTI however was bursting with flava! The shrimp was so very perfect. Perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked. Noodles were a little more than al dente but not anywhere near mush which is what I LOVE. It also was a little spicy and just had all the right combinations to round out a good twist on a Chinese classic. I think this dish would be great for asian parents who don't typically enjoy going to non-asian restaurants because it doesn't ""fit their taste"". Jessica, being pregnant, was so on top of her game. Checked back once, and came back to drop the dessert menu once (which we didn't have room for). I saw her from my peripheral waiting on standby for any of our needs, but never intruding, bothering, or rushing us. We spent a full hour & 15 minutes there in wonderful conversation. She filled my water a total of three times and was the kindest. Bill came out to $30. Left a 20% tip, totally deserved! Go Jessica.

For appetizers my table ordered the Bianco Flatbread, which is a small plate & a new menu item. I was a fan of this, because the flatbread is drizzled with truffle oil and you can pretty much put truffle oil on anything and I'll love it. We also ordered the  Spicy Chicken Tinga Quesadilla and the ranchito sauce that it came with really made this dish a hit.  It was REALLY good. As part of our main dish, we shared the California Club, Lettuce Wraps, and the Sesame Ginger Chicken Dumplings. The pizza crust was really good but I probably wouldn't get the California Club again. It was pretty much salad on a pizza. It made the pizza difficult to eat. The service was pretty good.

How could they have gotten rid of the Rosemary chicken and potato pizza?!!!??? We came Friday night and was shocked that there was no wait. I was even more shocked that they added tables on the 2 floor between the booths. Some advice-if the hostess seats you at the first table on the 2nd floor in between the booths asked to be moved. We kept getting bumped around as people were being walked to their tables by the food runners and bussers. Worst seat ever. Our server Brittany however was awesome! She made great recommendations and was really engaging and sweet! Their new agave mojito was watered down, but their strawberry basil martini was delicious. Unfortunately not consistent though because the 2nd martini I ordered was overly sweet and viscous as if they didn't water it down with the alcohol; I couldn't even finish it.  The Moroccan salad was pretty good with a lot of ingredients and flavors going on. The chipotle pizza was awesome, and I especially loved the lime&cilantro creme on it. We then couldn't decide between the Thai pizza or the spinach & artichoke pizza. Brittany suggested getting half and half so we did and I wish we had listened to Brittany from the get go and just gotten the whole spinach &  artichoke pizza, it was aweeeesome!!

14,Anthony B.,"Lodi, NJ",31,135,2.0,3.0,2015-02-08,"Ambiance/Decor/Atmosphere: Slightly on the boring side; almost diner like with the wood tables and brown color all over.  The tile pizza oven area is pretty eye catching, and there is a counter in front where you can sit and watch people cook.  The counter is a hit and a miss at the same time to me; it seems like a bar to drink at, but at the same time where you'd eat at in a diner.  I'm not sure if a diner feel is what they are going for, but what the hell........ Noise/sound level: LOUD as hell.  CPK is popular because of the offerings and it will almost always be crowded in this location.  You won't really have to yell to your guests, but you might have to speak louder than desired. Menu: The menu is on the verge of being gigantic; composed of many different tapas, appetizers, meals, desserts, and drinks.  But, it covers almost every option under the sun so whatever you want, you more than likely can get it at CPK. Service: The wait staff was friendly, accommodating, informative, helpful, and ticket times were as expected considering the amount of people eating. Food: My wife and I frequented CPK twice and haven't really had a chance to go back since.  The first time we went nuts; we had mac and cheese bites, tortilla spring roles, lettuce wraps, the dumplings.  The second time we had spicy sausage pablano and fennel flatbread, fish tacos, and the bianco flatbread.  Overall, I gather some of the food is frozen but the general presentation and flavor is not bad.  The food is fun and tastes as good as a chain restaurant can provide.   Bar: Full.  The fact this place is in the mall and you can get sloshed in it is crazy.  The beer selection is decent considering and the prices aren't too bad. Price: Each plate alone might not cost a lot, but the serving size will trick you.  Once you order a few dishes it will get expensive fast.  I don't think I've left here spending less than $60 for two people.  It's not too big of an issue though; you're here to have fun. Overall: I definitely want to return and try the habanero pizza, but be forewarned your experience might be detracted some if it's busy.  The second time we visited we were packed in like sardines so close to everyone else.  It was so tight I could smell the dude's breath next to me. Also, CPK delivers here, but for $100 minimum. (per their site)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-paramus?start=40,3.76,3.76,3.76,3.2760000000000007,3.76

The desserts are huge and delicious though especially anything with chocolate. I love chocolate. The staff is usually prompt and courteous.

The sauce is over salted. The vegetables few and far between. The only good thing about this place is their pizza and their salads. But with an attitude of ""the customer is not right"" this is a place to avoid. I spoke with the manager to tell him we waited 20 minutes for the chicken and there was no apology just an announcement telling me that the way they cook chicken takes 20 minutes. When I asked him why it wasn't stated as such on the menu, he said the problem was 'corporate' and that maybe he would notify them.

When our name was called, the waiter or host Matt looked at us and the baby, clearly exasperated and annoyed, and said we should have said table of 4 and by doing so we could not be seated then because a high chair would require extra set up. He insisted on telling us we should have said 4 if we wanted a high chair. I saw a stack of unused high chairs in the waiting area. It wasn't for lack of high chairs that we couldn't be seated right away. It was rude of him to point fingers so quickly. If there was a question about whether we needed a high chair, they should have clarified this when we made the reservation. I wasn't hiding my baby.  Goodbye CPK.

After years of passing by this chain-restaurant, we spontaneously decided to give it a try. They had 2 hostesses out front, but rather than offer seating options, both just said ""hello"" to us. We sat at the bar/counter and were told by a waitress that she'd be ""a few minutes."" That should have been our cue to depart. After about 5 minutes, she returned to take our drink order. She returned promptly with both drinks & took our food order. The salad & wine arrived promptly, but that's when time stopped. We waited and watched as several other diners, one right next to us and each having arrived after us, were served appetizers & main courses. Also, right next to our seats was the take-out station, where at least 3 people came in, ordered & left with their food before us. This is when we inquired about our order, only to be told twice that it would be delayed; ""we're really backed-up"" - even though there were several tables & seats at the counter empty. Finally after another 5 minutes, we were told by who we assumed to be a manager, that our food ""should be out soon."" Then I noticed the guy seated next to us rolling his eyes & shaking his head, so we told her we were done waiting. That's when my fish arrived, but my wife's pizza was just going into the oven. Yes, we could see all of the kitchen activity. Maybe they should re-look that feature. I will say they were all very apologetic and the manager even told us there would be no charge for our salad & drinks, which was unexpected & appreciated. Of course we gave the waitress a reasonable tip. But, had I been managing there, I would have ""comped"" the appetizer & drinks sooner. (Btw, the La Crema Pinot Noir was very good!)

Came here on a Sunday recently.  After being ignored the first 3 minutes, we saw a girl behind the bar and said 'excuse me' to get her attention.  She was the nastiest person I ever interacted with at a restaurant.  'YES?!' As if we interupted her life (not task, life) I asked if we entered the restaurant properly and if there was a hostess.  She snapped again 'WELL WHAT DO YOU WANT' we were shocked.  We asked if they were open and if we could be seated, she started looking around like we were idiots.  We were so taken back, finally someone came from the back and asked if we wanted to be seated.  We immediately asked what the woman's problem was.  We even offered to leave because we couldn't understand why she was so unbelievably nasty to us.  Our waiter apologized a few times for that woman's behavior.  The best part was she was wearing different clothes than everyone so I assume she was a manager (the nasty woman behind the bar). Things calmed down.  We ordered 2 five cheese pizzas with sauce.  We were sat next to the window, facing the inside of the mall.  The plates, napkins & utenesils were behind us on a ledge filled with 1/4 inch of dust & dirt.  I am confident that the ledge hasn't been wiped down since 2015, more so 2014.  Besides that, the window was FILLED with fruit flies.  I am talking at minimum 14 and max 23 each time I counted.  It was so gross.  It was very telling to the cleaning habits of thos restaurant. The food went down hill.  The pizza wasn't even half as good as I remember.  Pizza dripped with oil. We won't be back.  Shame as I used to love CPK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-paramus,3.64,3.62,3.62,2.34,3.6280000000000006

The first time I came here I got penne pesto and the pasta wasn't fully cooked to al dente! I decided to give this place more chances and increasingly everything has gotten better and I love it! The chicken milanese I did not like at all. I had the Chicken fettuccini tequila pasta but it could be creamier. I come here mostly because my boyfriend loves it.

Came 3 hours later and with no receipt. Dropped the food and left. The manager was extremely sincere and apologetic. However the staff needs a retrain on how to deal with people in general. I was told well you know delivery does take a long time. I said yes it does but not 3 hours. Took at least 45 minutes to place the order since I was placed on hold for 45 minutes.
