The service was pretty good, the drinks came within 5 min and our dessert came 5min after that.

We ordered the BBQ Chicken Salad w/avocado (this is my favorite dish) and Thai bbq Chicken, which is good, but I would never order this, because I'm Asian and do I really want to eat this at an American restaurant? no... but, my friend likes it so, we ordered it.  It's good, I just wouldn't order it. (like seriously, I'm not going to order pad thai at a Vietnamese restaurant). 2. The server was very nice and other people working in the restaurant were very friendly. The bartender reminded us to get our parking validated, which was super helpful. The not so good: 1. My friend asked for sweet and low when we ordered our drinks. The drinks came, but where's the sweet and low? lol... she tells me ""how long ago did I ask for sweet and low....."" and she asked again. 2.

190,JR C.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",694,480,461.0,3.0,2012-04-08,"Went to CPK for a Thursday lunch. There is plenty of inside dining and a sprinkling of outdoor seats for those that like to bask in the sun. I'm one of those and there was exactly 1 table left outside, but my colleagues preferred indoor, so I yielded to the seniors. One gripe about this place is the indoor table set up. There this nice spacious dining room set up in the front of a wide bar area, then there are the black sheep tables behind the bar that feel pretty isolated from the rest. Guess where they sat us? -=-Thai crunch salad-=- Pizza is good here and they have good customer service. You can't go wrong with the pizza, so I'm going to rate something that isn't so typical here. The Thai crunch salad was good for a light-ish lunch. The best part about that was the peanut dressing. The crunchy wonton strips could get a little carried away on top, but it makes it taste good, so it's hard to turn it away as unhealthy as it is. Chicken is pretty forgettable on this plate, because there was barely any of it.

Thank goodness for heaters outside, and seats! We were much more willing to wait around for a table for the 8 of us thanks to the heaters and outdoor seating. Also, we were STARVING! CPK will not give you bread as an appetizer unless you request it, so if you're super hungry like we were, ASK! We ordered a lot of food. Good flavoring, oh, and I loved my honey wheat crust on my pizza. You can request it on yours as well if you would like. Yum! Loved our server, she was sweet, on top of her ish, game face on! They actually had to put two tables together to accommodate our party of 8 which randomly bloomed to 9, so it was a bit of a tight fit, but it was still alright. The bathroom was a little tiny, but I think that was because there were oh maybe 5 bazillion hungry Asians scattering out to the nearby streets scavenging for food due to the over flooding of the 626 night market event that happened. We dealed with it. It ended up being alright. Overall though, your average CPK. Nothing super memorable in either a positive or negative way.

CPK's are staffed by people who are trained to verbally suggest specific upgrades, appetizers, and desserts.  Their actual feelings and emotions have been trained right out of them, or at least until the end of their shift.

The pasta arrived extremely dry and salad had only 1 container of dressing, not extra as ordered. So I called CPK and spoke to the manager who initially said that they are not responsible because it was ordered thru LA Bite and the payment went thru them. She tried to put it on LA bites that they processed and forwarded the order. But when I asked if they received my specific instructions, the manager looked at the order, then said yes, they see my specific instructions. So I asked then why weren't the instructions followed. All she said was sorry and there's nothing more they can do. I would've appreciated her taking responsibility that they made the error right off the bat instead of trying to put it off to LA bites like they didn't forward CPK the question. But all she said was sorry and that I would need to come and pick up more salad dressing if I wanted more. I was very disappointed by the response especially because they made the error. I was very turned off that she did not even suggest to make up for the error. I wasn't even asking for a refund but needed clarification why it in turned out like this not to mention the chicken tequila fettuccine was so dry and almost sauce less it was prob the worst that's ever tasted from cpk.

Glad we gave it a shot. Luckily the habanero sauce is also ON THE SIDE or I wouldn't have touched even a slice! The sauce was a light pink color, somewhat 'mushy' and had a kick halfway through. If you don't like spice, stay far far away. The pizza was different in a good way. Pesto sauce with shredded carnitas. The pizza was small for a full. Full BBQ Chicken Salad ($14.95): I'm really not sure why a salad costs more than the pizzas on the menu... The portion was decently sized but not big enough to justify a $15 salad!!

Rather she avoided eye contact for the next 20 minutes and so we left without having a birthday cake.  I realize that one simple family does not make or break a big business like CPK, but I was sad for the first time tonight at how many wonderful experiences over these many years was so tainted by such a dismissive way of dealing with us.  It felt like ""comp their dinner and get them the hell out of here"" was the attitude of this manager.   Well, they succeeded in that, I suppose, because we won't be returning to what used to be my son's favorite anf traditional place to have his birthday dinner.

Usually wen we place catering orders, the manager or whoever is responsible to take your order is happy to answer any questions regarding the menu and the quantity needed for the number of guests you have etc. but at CPK the person in charge for taking the order, Michele, had no clue. With my first question she turned to another person working in the kitchen and requested the answer, that person referred to the menu I was holding in my hand which obviously  did not have the answer and hence was the reason I needed to ask the question. So with that question (about the number of sandwiches on each tray/platter) unanswered, I proceeded with another question about which sandwiches could be served cold and which ones had to be warm upon serving, at this point Michele said ""i have another customer I need to help"" and left me standing for so long that I chose to leave and place my order for 50 guests at a different restaurant that actually appreciated the business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pasadena?start=180,4.16,3.68,3.68,2.7560000000000002,3.8720000000000003

California club pizza - It's basically a salad on top of a pizza but it's surprisingly good. I love the avocado on top and the bacon bits.  Jambalaya pasta - They give generous amounts of chicken and shrimp in the pasta. Really flavorful and delicious.  Chocolate souffle - Not the greatest here.

67,Jo S.,"North Hollywood, CA",221,688,3223.0,2.0,2016-01-09,"We had a very bizarre experience at this location over the holidays. We had family in town, we took them to several places in Pasadena and they wanted to have an early dinner here before boarding a plane. We stopped going to CPK for a few years (used to eat here a lot) after we had bad experiences at some other locations.  The menu is pretty much the same. Been there, done that! But this location is pretty and the area is beautiful so we thought it could work. Wrong! Once we got inside, we noticed that more than half of the restaurant was empty. It was just four of us, but the hostess told us it'd take 20 minutes to get a table. What's this bad trend lately that restaurants have when they're half empty and they tell you that you need to wait for a table? Is that some sort of mind game? Not cool! They seat us sooner, but not in the main area which was more lively. They took us to the right, put us at a table in front of the fountain drinks station where the waiters come and go. Not ideal! We got bread and olive oil, great change instead of the bread and butter they used to have. Our waitress was a cookie kinda gal, way too chatty. I wouldn't care if things 'd go well. We asked for water and each of us got a glass of wine. It took forever to get the wine. They bring it in small carafes now that they pour to you into glasses. Frankly, just pour it directly into a glass. It's a waste of glassware and time. I got a Pinot Noir and it was the worst red wine I've ever had (it makes $2 Chuck a major winner). But that wasn't the problem. Our waitress forgot to bring the water and she disappeared for a long time (she did mention she needed to go to the bathroom TIM!). We finally walked to another waiter to ask for water (our throats were dry from the bread and olive oil). Then, we got Managers coming to the table, apologizing, bringing extra bread, flatbread from the house. It's great and we appreciate that, but we didn't need extra food, just water on time. Getting water refills from our waitress was an on going issue. When we got our food, just 2 pizza-s showed up, one wasn't something any of us ordered. Once we got the food, it was just OK. The Sicilian was greasy, The California Club had too much lettuce on top, My Garlic chicken was just OK. The waitress wasn't around when you needed something, but she was around to keep asking us questions (like what we'll do for New Year's Eve?) and ask my husband if he was done when he was still eating, she did that several times. Yes, serving food is an art. We need to appreciate it when it's done right. Not here. They need major training. You need to bring customers things they need, be attentive, be around, but discreet. Don't keep interrupting conversations, be pleasant but not too chatty. Like I said, it's an art that's appreciated, but it needs to be more than mastered here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pasadena?start=40,3.6,3.65,3.65,2.9840000000000004,3.6300000000000003

137,Mary N.,"Jonesboro, AR",13,7,,4.0,2016-06-04,"We stayed at a hotel near here so we decided to walk and get dinner at CPK, having never been to one. The wait for a table was about 20 min, which was right with what they'd warned. We were seated outside, which would have been great had there been more lighting. I enjoy a darker, outdoor dining experience but I do like enough light to read my menu. A real candle, an ample amount of string lighting, anything that wouldn't have made it necessary for my family to all use their phones as lights, would have been preferable. Not sure if the lighting was hidden and just not turned on, or if it was actually meant to be that dark, but when the food arrived, we could barely make out what we were eating. The place stayed busy, almost too busy for the servers they have. Once we were seated, it was about ten minutes before anyone asked us our drink order. To be honest, we were contemplating heading to the steakhouse next door. All in all, I'm glad we didn't. Once they took our drink order, the ball got rolling. Our server Jamie (I think that was her name-she was from NYC)-was awesome. Very friendly, and even though she was busy, she kept refills and everything going. There was also a male server that looked as though he was staying running; he had originally taken our drink order and also helped serve the food. Very friendly and upbeat. Another lady brought us napkins and silverware and for a first time visit, a free appetizer! Some kind of cheesy flatbread that my husband and kids thoroughly enjoyed, if the fact that they wolfed it down says anything. I was concentrating on the avocado club egg rolls we had ordered. If you like bacon, these are for you! Very tasty, with just enough tomatoes and avocado and the dipping sauces go well with them. Let's see, around the table reviews, my husband liked the ribeye a lot but wished there was a mashed potato option (were southern) :). But it was cooked medium, just the way he liked it. My oldest enjoyed his garlic chicken and veggies and the avocado ranch sauce & my youngest liked his pepperoni pizza, although he didn't care for the amount of basil. There is quite a bit. I got a works pizza and it was good, it could have used a little more sauce and cheese, but there were ample veggies and the meats were huge. Overall, we would go back. It had an above average chain food taste (reminded me of Cheesecake Factory somewhat), but the people made it a great experience.

The serves were on top of their things and made the experience pleasant. The food is a -ok which is why I gave it a 3-star review. I feel like there is just nothing special about it, nothing that really calls to me that is. For instance, the cheesy Alfredo is just cheesy not lush or flavorful.  They do have a good drink selection which is nice but not the main point of going to a restaurant in my option. Good thing to note, it is fairly easy to have big group parties here if you're looking for a spot to host something of the sorts.

However, we left very disappointed that we had spent our money on such trashy, overpriced food. First of all, we weren't seated in the main dining area, even though there were so many empty tables. Instead, we were seated in the uglier part/ back of the restaurant next to other groups of Asians. Coincidence? I hope so, but this isn't the first time I've noticed this happening.  I ordered based on what I used to love, the spinach artichoke dip, and the Thai Chicken Pizza. Horrible, just horrible. The spinach artichoke dip came with really stale tortilla chips, and the dip itself wascold and seemed like it had been sitting in the microwave for some time. We asked our server for new chips, and he brought new ones for us which were less stale, but instead of replacing the stale chips with the new ones, he left the stale ones and brought the new ones on another plate. Why would we even eat the stale ones?? For the Thai chicken pizza was so bad for something that I remember being so good. The Brussel sprouts were raw and soggy all at the same time. The carrots tasted uncooked and it was just basically a raw salad on top of the pizza. There didn't even seem to be any cheese on it. We also ordered the mushroom pizza, which sounded amazing, and asked for the truffle oil for another $1.50. No truffle oil was on the pizza when we got it, so I complained and our waiter gave us some on the side. The chicken piccata pasta was extremely sour and lemony, and overall, everything else we ordered was disappointing and not even worth mentioning in this review.

Nearly 10 minutes later, a female server came over and introduced herself and said she would be with us after she took drinks to another table. After waiting almost 15 minutes, we were finally able to order. While the server acknowledged the slow service, I don't think she actually realized how long we had been waiting there. After that, the meal moved somewhat quickly enough, although there was an additional delay in getting our checks taken care of. The server was at least quick on refilling drinks, and the runner that brought our food brought it quickly.  As for the food itself, it was on par for CPK. I had the lunch combo of a California veggie pizza and the Farmer's Market soup. The soup was flavorful, although I could have done without the layer of oil that was added to the top of the soup.

Given this is my first time ordering curb side, I asked questions such as  where  I should park (park in parking structure or on the street?) I feel this is a valid question given it is Pasadena and there may be parking in the front for pick ups.  She responded with a tone that was short and really made me feel like this was an obvious fact that I should know. And to make matters worse, her response was vague and lacked detail.  When ordering with her, she misheard my meal and was snappy when I corrected her. What happened to good ol customer service?  Or in this case, common courtesy. Someone working in this position  (especially on the phone ) should have good social skills and communication skills - both are lacking.

I'm also forced to package the food in bags, I'm not even an employee of the company. I'm contracted by the customer to pick up their food. Does CPK not package food to all of their customers?

I'm still waiting on a call from upper management. Final Update: I spoke with the General Manager, and he disregarded my complaints on his poorly run restaurant.

First of all the Pasadena location should quit advertising and taking ""curbisde"" orders.  There is no possibility of picking up your food curbside because they have allowed the restaurant next door to set up their valet service and park valeted cars in every single short term space.  There isn't a single space open to allow you to pick up your food.  So this is just false advertising and makes the whole experience very stressful when it is meant to make it easier.  Pasadena loves to give tickets and pass regulations so I am going to make sure to report the valet's practices, but that is another matter. I ordered the Chicken Milanese which is supposed to be warm panko crusted chicken.  There was no panko and the chicken was cold and dry.  I also ordered the mushroom pasta which was fine.  Finally I ordered the Strawberry Shortcake described as ""piled high with seasonal strawberries, whipped cream and lemon zest"".  When I got home and opened it up what I have is a soggy biscuit, eleven tiny slices of strawberry (maybe the equivalent of 2 1/2 whole) and no whipped cream or lemon zest at all.

Our waitress, Jasmine (?), was very nice about it, and told us her manager was going to come over to talk to us.   After about 15 minutes of paranoia that another spider would again drop on us, the manager came over and asked in a relatively sarcastic way for us to explain what happened. We told her what happened, and she kept insisting that she had never seen a spider in the building - implying that because she had never seen one, we must have brought it ourselves. She then asked us if we had been in any ""dense forests"" that day. She was very rude given the circumstances and highly implied that we had brought in this spider as some sort of scheme.   Although our waitress was very nice and the restaurant ended up giving us a free dessert, the behavior of the manager was completely offensive. Seriously, spiders are icky, so WHY WOULD WE BRING IN A GIANT SPIDER TO THE RESTAURANT?    Other than the incident, the food was alright.

I ordered the half roasted veggie salad with grilled shrimp and oil and balsamic on the side. I was happily accommodated. The reason for only four stars is the amount of veggies in it. Very little avocado, I was tempted to ask for more, and skimpy on the other veggies as well. But yummy shrimp! The salmon is great too but out of my price range.

I usually get the California Veggie pizza with no cheese. In the past, I've been told many times that this was vegan. Only recently, I saw an old Yelp review that said that the pizza crust at California Pizza Kitchen has eggs. Unfortunately, it's true. I confirmed it with the waitress. Seriously disappointed that I've been eating eggs this whole time, and none of the employees here were knowledgeable enough to tell me. What if this was a serious allergy? They really need to know their ingredients better.  I had to settle for the Dakota Smashed Pea + Barley soup and Super Spinach + Quinoa salad, which are both vegan. But be careful if you're allergic to dairy (or the ingredients in any of their other soups), because they warned me that all the soups are close together and can splash into one another. The price was pretty reasonable since it was from their lunch menu ($8.95 for a soup and salad lunch duo, valid Monday - Friday from 11 am - 4 pm). I was really hoping for something more substantial... The salad was very bland, and some pieces of the greens were just so bitter that I had to spit them out. The soup was just okay.  My boyfriend got the Shrimp Zucchini Scampi, which was also not great. It was mostly zucchini, with not much pasta or shrimp. And for a price of $15.99, the portion was just too small. My boyfriend eats an average amount, and he was still so hungry afterwards. He literally had to scavenge for the last bits of shrimp meat in the tails. And he even ate some of my leftover salad, which is saying a lot because he hates salad haha.  The added star is from the great service. Our waitress was so patient with my many questions and made sure to double check all the ingredients in their dishes.

While on disability in August 2016, I ordered this through  . YESSSSSSSSSSSS!!! I think I posted it to Instagram about 4 different times in a two month period.  Fast forward to August 2017. While on staycation, a friend invited me to lunch so we could catch up. I chose CPK since I hadn't been inside the restaurant in a few years. We were greeted well and seated quick. Our waitress Kitty was such a sweetie. My friend brought her nine-year-old daughter and Kitty treated this child as if she knew her. It was too cute to watch their interaction.  My friend and her daughter both ordered pizza and salad. I went straight for my chicken piccata. OMG, it was just as good as when I have it delivered because I do still order it at least once a month. YESSS!! My friend couldn't finish her pizza due to the wonderful bread CPK gives every table. It filled her up quicker than expected. My friend's daughter, well Kitty brought her, her own bread basket and she ate it all by herself. She's a big bread-eater for some odd reason, lol.  When ordering the chicken piccata, I suggest extra cream sauce. There's a charge but it's worth it. The chicken piccata comes with three pieces of breast meat and sometimes the chicken can be a little dry, so the extra cream sauce helps. In this case, during this visit, such was NOT the case. The three pieces were moist and the extra cream sauce was perfect for the pasta. I like a wet pasta and the sauce has lemon in it. SCORE! Because I was on staycation, I ordered an alcoholic beverage. WOO HOO! I'm a Beyonce fan so to see a drink on the menu called ""Beehive,"" well, of COURSE, I had to try it. It's a sangria of sorts and while I like some sangrias, I'm more of a Moscato type of wine drinker. The beehive reminded me of a red wine so boohoo. The strawberries inside, once infused, were great! I should have stuck with their traditional sangria.  All in all, good visit. It was a little warm inside the restaurant but that could have been due to the alcohol. It does raise the blood pressure lol.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pasadena,2.96,3.12,3.476,,3.0560000000000005
36,Shelley L.,"Sierra Madre, CA",0,4,1.0,5.0,2017-08-21,"I absolutely loved this place. Amazing service, great food, and possibly the best lemonade I've ever had. The place has a bar for alcohol drinks. The out door seating is beautifully laid out. And it is just beautifully decorated inside. I'd highly recommend this place to all my friends and anyone looking for good Italian food. Besides the food and service, the place is outstanding gorgeous. There is also plenty of parking underneath. I would always come here because it's just so good. Booth seating in the back has a view to the side walk, street, and sky. The beautifully made menu makes it so easy to find what I want to have. I ordered pasta with shrimp and the shrimp was seasons PERFECTLY. I absolutely loved it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pasadena?start=20,3.0,3.13,3.48,,3.078

30,Marie A.,"Alhambra, CA",0,7,2.0,2.0,2017-09-02,"The food was good and the outdoor setting is beautiful but during my visit the hostess' and cashier girls were very rude. Once I walked in nobody greeted me even though there was two employees at the hostess station by he door. I had to ask them where I would be able to order, they just pointed, no hellos or how are yous. There wasn't many people so I don't understand why. They sure did stare at me though, it was uncomfortable. They have these girls working there with no manners. While ordering I asked the young woman working the register a question about the food portions and she rolled her eyes and proceeded to tell me that she didn't know the answer. I definitely won't be going back. Maybe they'll hire more mature staff in the future and make customers experiences better than mine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pasadena?start=20,3.16,3.11,3.472,,3.13
28,G R.,"San Gabriel, CA",0,32,68.0,3.0,2017-09-20,So they have Remolded this location and given it a more extensive and open feel.   The wait staff are extremely friendly and the food has always been fresh and well prepared.  Not a fans of the Fresca flavored drinks but the Pasta dishes as well as the salmon were good.  In Pasadena a very nice alternative to The Cheesecake Factory. If you are deciding between the two choose CPK by a mile,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pasadena?start=20,3.24,3.13,3.464,,3.174
17,Daniel L.,"Alhambra, CA",0,34,249.0,4.0,2017-09-27,"CPK serves good food specially crispy thin crust pizza. We ordered Bolognese spaghetti and Banh Mi Bowl tonight. The meat sauce in the Bolognese spaghetti is not salty and that makes it more healthy. The nutritious Banh Mi Bowl is one of the new CPK power bowls that have good portion of fresh avocados, cucumbers, carrots, sesame seeds, and grilled chicken. The chili-lime vinaigrette and serrano peppers make the bowl mouth watering. The waitress was very friendly and helpful. We enjoyed our dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pasadena,3.36,3.12,3.464,,3.2160000000000006
27,F. W.,"N HOLLYWOOD, CA",1,103,,2.0,2017-09-28,I am a fan of CPK but I would recommend the Studio City location or the Glendale location over the Pasadena location. I ordered Chicken Fettuccine. The chicken in the dish was chopped up in tiny pieces almost like carnitas and there wasn't much of it. Everything else was fine about the dish. The issue was with the service. I sat outside in the lovely patio on 9/24 and had to ask several times for water and the bread that was offered to me. It wasn't packed with people because I went off hour so I'm not sure what the issue was. The server would walk right past me to take drink orders and food orders from other tables after he said he would be right back with water and/or bread for me. He was very friendly though.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pasadena?start=20,3.24,3.12,3.456,,3.1680000000000006
13,Aura M.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",1026,321,2120.0,3.0,2017-09-29,"09/26/2017 UPDATE REVIEW:                                               What's wrong with your hosts?? No matter how good is your food, the first person to welcome you in the restaurant is the key to give your customers a good or bad impression. I went there on Tuesday night with a group of friends. Because i was the first one to arrive I requested a table for 6. The 2 hosts instead of welcoming to the restaurant WHICH IS A NORMAL THING YOU EXPECT FROM THE HOSTS they asked me to wait for them to finish their conversation. Are you kidding me???? I waited 5 minutes until they finally decided to give me a table. Maybe they don't need our business?? although the place was pretty empty. CPK should hire better workers otherwise they're going to lose business especially when there's a lot of places to go.                                        Then we had to look for our waitress to take our order, after 20 minutes since we sat down. Yeah, pathetic. PREVIOUS REVIEW: We were called the ""old peeps"" lol. And it's true since our last visit was 2 years ago. The menu has definitely have changed-for better. There are more food selection for those who are not that crazy about their pizza. Our waitress, Milo, was so nice. The GM came over to our table and introduced himself after placing on our table a cheesy flat bread as a complementary to our dinner which i think that was pretty cool-unexpected. Then he told us about all the latest changes in the menu like no more tiramisu :( etc. I don't know about you but that personal attention is always nice and really appreciated which makes me feel like coming back more frequently......also, the drink menu is also new. They added more cocktails and other refreshing drinks. The restaurant was cleaned. We got our ticket validated as soon as we stepped inside the restaurant. The food was good. The dessert was yummy too. It was a nice experience.....glad we went back!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pasadena,3.16,3.11,3.452,,3.13
24,Samuel H.,"Glendale, CA",17,11,,4.0,2017-09-30,"The food at all CPKs are about the same but what sets this CPK apart from the others is the location. This CPK is in a nice location and has outdoor seating. We parked in the street which is free after 5PM. They do a 90 minute parking validation as well but we couldn't really find where the parking lot was. With the location, you can take a stroll right in the heart of Pasadena. City hall is nearby and it looks great at night. Perfect for a stroll after dinner!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pasadena?start=20,3.28,3.1,3.452,,3.1720000000000006
23,V E.,"Pasadena, CA",13,273,9.0,4.0,2017-10-02,"I have a love/hate relationship with this place. The menu good and is constantly evolving. They've added several pastas, a steak, and a Banh Mi bowl, and still have the classics like the avocado egg rolls and BBQ chicken pizza. However, the service is spotty. Everything from seating, to ordering, getting food, getting service, getting the check, and validating parking takes a long time. Set aside at least 1.5 hours to eat here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pasadena?start=20,3.24,3.12,3.448,,3.1680000000000006
11,Irene S.,"Hayward, CA",42,172,551.0,3.0,2017-10-23,"Came by here while staying next door at the Westin. Came by a lil less than hour before they closed. It was pretty quiet, maybe 2-3 tables had customers. Upon entering nobody really acknowledged us. They kept going about their business and then came to the door after. Kinda weird feeling. However, once we were seated we were greeted by our server (forgot her name). She was really nice and super helpful in helping us choose some options for meals. I ordered the mac and cheese and a side salad and my bf a cobb salad with chicken. Our food came by pretty fast. I was very underwhelmed with the salad. It lacked flavor and freshness. I can barely finish it. My mac and cheese was good until I noticed a whole bunch of black stringy things which at first looked like hairs in it. However, upon reporting it to our waitress she said the cooks told her it was residue from a sponge ....weird... but anyways she took it back and didnt charge us but at this point I couldnt even eat anything anymore. Kind of put a damper on my experience. However, my bf enjoyed his salad and I really did like the Cucumber Lime Cooler I had.

8,Jen R.,"Pasadena, CA",0,17,,1.0,2017-12-29,I don't even know where to begin with this meal.  We ordered dinner from here and this is what we ordered: 1. Kid's Mac and Cheese 2. BBQ Chicken Pizza on Crispy Thin Crust ($1.50 more for that) 3. Hawaiian Pizza on Crispy Thin Crust ($1.50 more for that) 4. Chicken Dumplings There was not a single thing here that we could eat.  The Mac and Cheese did not have ANY cheese sauce on it.  It was plain pasta with a tiny bit of broken sauce.  Both pizzas had SOGGY crust that was flimsy and not the slightest bit crispy at all. And don't forget that the pineapple on the Hawaiian pizza was not even cooked! The chicken dumplings were ICE COLD in the center like they had just been taken out of the refrigerator.  I understand that this is a chain restaurant and my expectations should not be that high but this is absurd and just completely unacceptable.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pasadena,3.52,3.22,3.42,,3.3400000000000007

This afternoon I decided to try their Kung Pao Spaghetti which was alright. I guess this is not a direct reflection of this specific CPK but their Kung Pao Spaghetti is definitely not worth the $17.51 that was paid. I would've been more satisfied going to Panda Express and getting a plate for under $8.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pasadena,3.72,3.24,3.416,,3.432000000000001
