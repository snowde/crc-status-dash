Many families go here with young children even though they serve alcohol   Anyhow for appetizers we had Chicken Dumplings: just regular dumplings... Lettuce Wraps: personally i didnt like the chicken, i normally eat only white meat, i felt as if it was fatty like chicken thighs  Spinach Artichoke Dip: definitively my favorite, very cheesy and tasteful Pizzas Pesto Chicken (thin crust): excellent pizza, i absolutely loved it and would return just for this  Five Cheese + Fresh Tomato: ehh... didnt like it very much",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pembroke-pines?start=40,2.9560000000000004,2.9560000000000004,2.9560000000000004,2.9560000000000004,2.9560000000000004

We ordered two quesadilla plates from the small plate menu which was pretty tasty. It had 4 slices with a spicy dipping sauce. We ordered a Hawaiian pizza and to our surprise when it came out it was soooo small for the both of us. I am a petite girl and I was left hungry. It is 10 inches and as pricey as an extra large pizza from another pizza chain like Papa Johns or Dominoes. It would have been nice to have let us know that it was so small so that we would have ordered more.  The pizza was tasty, but definitely not out of this world.

While the pizza is still there, they have taken most of them out of the menu. I ordered pepperoni, sausage and mushroom while my wife ordered pepperoni, You know, it just was not that good. What a shame! Cheesecake factory makes a better cheese pizza now. They also took out the hot fudge and caramel sundae out of the menu. The kids sundaes were crap. We looked around and it seemed as if the salads were pretty good. Maybe we'll go back for salads, but I'm not bothering to go there for pizza anymore.

I learned this after her bringing us the beer, so at that point I tried to make sure to get everything I would  need from her so I wouldn't have to wait 20 minutes for a napkin. Even waiting on the food took a good 45 minutes after the waitress put the order in. The pizza was good and I was hoping it was because it took forever and a day to get.  As further proof that it took forever my beer was straight warm when the pizza arrived.

The manager made his appearance at the end of the meal and looked like he was going to doze off standing by the table, he also looked confused after seeing my uneaten salad and just stood there not knowing what to say to the point I was actually embarrassed for him.

Anyways, service really blows here. Any location I've been too, one thing remains, the FOH hiring manager sucks. My waitress was within arms distance of me and I spent most of my meal waiving her down. My boyf nearly finished his beer before she returned to the table to take our order. We ordered a small plate, the white corn guacamole, cause uh duh camole' and it was really good. Alittle bland in flavor, but nothing like and salt couldn't fix. We decided to split the Harvest Kale salad and a chipotle chicken pizza. We obviously went with the veg option and swapped the chicken out for avocado. Dude, first off the full order of the salad is ridic. Order a half unless you're hungry enough to eat a horse. My man and I couldn't even take it down, but que clasé ensalada meng. Baby kale, toasted farro, heirloom carrots, napa cabbage, red grapes, marinated cranberries, sliced pear , almonds and goat cheese tossed in a house made citrus vinaigrette. This salad has a little bit of a kick to it but it is really good. Like really, really, good. The pizza was great too, three cheese mix, avocados, topped off with a spicy chipotle sauce and a black bean corn salsa. It was toasted to perfection and a lime cream drizzled all over. Uff that shit was delicious. We opted out of dessert considering I would have waited 10 years for my waitress to come back, but whatever. I flagged her down just to get my tab. She then drops off the check and never returned? Like hey, I coulda walked out and you'd never know. Left the cash with the hostess and made my way home.

It's been a while since I've been impressed by the service in a restaurant, but Lily was so nice and attentive with everything. Upon ordering, I was about to go with my usual, which is the half Chinese chicken salad, but she convinced me to try something new and go with the Thai crunch. It's actually become my new favorite and I'll definitely go again to try it. I know CPK is a pizza place, but I really like their salads there. Not sure how healthy they are, but I justify it with all the veggies that are in it, ha! Over the years, the menu has generally stayed the same but my favorites are still there, and some new yummy food items as well! My dad got the banh mi bowl, and I was pretty impressed by how colorful and yummy looking it was. It's definitely on my list of things to try.

Even though I come here all the time without even entering the mall. This specific location is actually attached to the mall so it might be confusing to someone that doesn't know the area.  Anyways I really like the pizza from here I usually get the margarita or the mushroom with truffle oil is soooo good! They bring the truffle oil out in a little container so you can add it yourself as you please. (Perfect for parents who have picky eaters as kids). But what I really love about this place is the Thai crunch salad! It's my absolute favorite salad ever!!!! I love how it has peanuts and they put two different types of dressing that's fresh but tangy at the same time. They also have two sizes which is perfect because you can either get a portion for yourself or a portion for the whole table. And I recommend that if you order the Thai crunch add the avocado,(Thank me later).The hummus is great as well they bring it out with warm pita perfect to share right before the salad.  I haven't actually gotten any of the desserts because I'm usually stuffed after all the hummus and salad and pizza but hopefully one day soon I'll try it.  Inside tip: it's really cold inside, they have a balcony outside where you can usually get a table but the waiters sometimes forget about you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pembroke-pines,3.44,3.44,3.44,,3.4400000000000004

Pizza came into mind because it was a great way of getting our carbs and protein in but the problem is finding a healthy pizza. That's when my friend decided on California Pizza Kitchen. I was skeptic at first but quickly my mind was changed after we had our meal.  For the pizza we had gone with wild mushroom with the truffle oil of course because truffle. We had shared it and it was more than enough for a light meal. The truffle oil with the mushroom combination definitely made this one a go to choice for me.  Then for a salad we went with a half size of Thai crunch and goodness did this pack a punch(call of duty reference). I'm slightly biased when it comes to anything Thai related just because of the peanut dressing and combination of veggies. The half of it was more than enough and we did share it. I couldn't imagine eating the full size but it would seem like a great size if you really want a salad and have more people with you to eat.  We didn't wait at all we were shown to a table very quickly and the service was great, our waiter was kind. We did get our food before the bread, not a big deal but we were kind of hoping to get something before our food to snack on.
