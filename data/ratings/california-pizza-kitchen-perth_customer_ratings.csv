0,Jay K.,"Perth, Australia",19,10,11.0,5.0,2016-10-05,"I had no idea this place had actually opened. I was with a friend walking around the harbour when we noticed they were open! We walked in for lunch, got  taken to a table straight away The service was phenomenal - we were approached by Jose, Ciara and Jade within 5 mins each asking if we wanted to order some drinks. Some may say that's an overlapse of organisation, I'd prefer that over no service whatsoever! The food was beyond amazing. The head chef knows his game and what I found particularly amazing was his team of staff responding with thw utmost respect and professionalism I had a starter, mains and dessert ( yes all for lunch. I was THAT hungry), as well as a peppermint tea with the Citrus Crush Cocktail ( again, yes, I was day drinking! )  Overall the location, the service, the layout, the staff and food was amazing! Will most certainly be back for sure!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-perth,,,,,
4,Jo-Harri M.,"Perth, Australia",40,12,10.0,3.0,2016-10-09,Food was good and price is similar with any restaurant.  Their pizza delivers on taste.  The only problem was the service.  Takes too long for orders to arrive and they wouldn't let us in even if we already said who's reservation we were under on.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-perth,,,,,
7,Tom B.,"East Perth, Australia",0,1,6.0,2.0,2016-10-17,"The waiters and waitresses were polite and friendly, but it was clear that management do not have sufficient procedures in place when it came to service. Service was slow, even though it didn't seem very busy. We had to ask twice for someone to come over and order our drinks. A friend tried to order a particular beer, only to be told 5 minutes later that they did not have it. We then ordered a replacement, to again be told 5 minutes later that they had run out that too. It took four choices and a lot of 'two'ing-and-fro'ing' before they had something available. I ordered a mojito, but it just tasted like lime cordial. After ordering mains, the meals came out in dribs and drabs, with about 15 minutes between the first person's meal being served and the last. The food was good, but they need to cut their menu down - they are trying to spread themselves too thinly. I had a s'more jar for desert, which was delicious. Hopefully these are just teething problems and will be ironed out soon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-perth,,,,,
2,Lauren N.,"Heathridge, Australia",31,10,41.0,3.0,2016-12-07,"The place was noisy, the food was average, the service was good but nothing to rave home about. It was reasonably priced, it is not my kind of restaurant though if I was at boat harbour and was craving pizza I would go to Little Caesars instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-perth,,,,,
5,Wot E.,"Perth, Australia",1,4,1.0,2.0,2016-12-07,"Went here for the first time. Even though there were many empty tables had to wait 30 minutes to be seated as apparently kitchen has a problem coping with demand. While waiting saw many potential customers turned away.  Not the best way to run a business, either they have to improve their processes or look for a smaller venue. Even though only half filled the venue is very noisy due to all of the hard surfaces reflecting sound making conversation difficult. Artichoke and Spinach dip for entre was nice. Mains (pizzas) took an hour to be served. They were luke warm and average in taste (not in the same league as Il Padrino in Northbridge). Prices were reasonable Saving grace for the restaurant was the wait staff who were cheerful and attentative. Overall an average experience with little to offer to entice back for another visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-perth,,,,,
3,Emily E.,"Perth, Australia",24,26,21.0,2.0,2016-12-13,"After an amazing experience at the California Pizza Kitchen in Anaheim, USA, we were keen to try the Hillarys one. Whilst the menu is the same, the execution is completely different. Firstly, I wanted to order a glass of wine, and out of the 8 wines available by the glass, only ONE was available. They brought water to the table and my husband's glass had a visible lip mark. The food came out quickly. The toppings were generous on our California Veggie pizza, but it didn't taste anything like the one that we had in the US. The pizza base was very doughy and the ingredients tasted very bland. Reading other reviews, this seems to be a reoccurring problem. Everything is very expensive, especially their cocktails and sangria. Whoever is the manager of this restaurant mustn't have a care in the world of how this restaurant is travelling. They need to start reading some of the reviews. It is a busy time of year, so you need to increase your orders so that you have wine and drinks available. You need to taste the food that is being produced so that it can be improved. Compare this to the amazing manager/owner at Anaheim. We ordered one of their brand new dishes, and he personally came to our table and asked our opinion of the dish, and how we were enjoying the food, and if we needed anything to speak to him. I would give this restaurant a miss.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-perth,,,,,
6,Julie R.,"Sorrento, Australia",2,2,,1.0,2017-05-10,Disappointing firstly couldn't get through to phone for a Pizza when I finally had to go there and wait a very average pizza not much topping and small in size won't be ordering pizza from there again,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-perth,,,,,
1,Chris V.,"Mosman Park, Australia",15,1,,2.0,2017-11-11,"Waited half an hour to order and then another half an hour for food to arrive, very small portions for the price paid",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-perth,,,,,
