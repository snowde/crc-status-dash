I will say, though, our server was FANTASTIC, and super patient with our indecision.  I started off with the white corn guac - I didn't really need an appetizer, but I was cranky and needed to take my meds, so i really didn't want to wait for a my pizza. I'm glad I did, though - it was REALLY good. Not so much a guac as kind of a salad with chunks of avocado and white corn - not pureed, just kinda mixed. I'm gonna be digging up the recipe later.  First of all, props to PA for requiring calorie counts on menus in restaurants. Holy crap. Amazing how when you think something might be semi-healthy then see the calories, you realize its no wonder you haven't lost any weight. But the real highlight of the decision process was realizing that you can get any of the pizzas with thin crust and its 170 calories less. Score! Two friends both got the fresh tomato and cheese pizza, and I got the wild mushroom plus bacon (which probably cancelled out the thin crust calories, but whatever). We all ate WAY too much, and then shared out leftovers with the young homeless guys digging through the trash cans outside.

He and I both love garlic, but when I tell you it was garlicky--it was in the way that bites you back. It was so strong that I could still smell the garlic on his breath after eating, even though I ate some, too. The pear and gorgonzola pizza was a great combination of salty and sweet. The little spring mixed in a mayo dressing that tasted like straight up mayo could have been done without.  I didn't really love CPK's pizza's but I didn't not like them, either. Was lunch for two worth $50? Probably not. Was it worth the calories? Also, probably not. I think this is one of those places where if you are habitual with what you eat, you might crave. Like other chain restaurants like TGIFridays, they push their sugary drinks. There seemed to be a lot of added chemicals in the crust.

CPK is a national chain of restaurants for specialty pizza and other related food items (pastas, salads, etc.). They tend to be on the pricier end, but some of their pizzas are pretty darn good, and certainly justify their price tag. At this location, I've found the veggie on the honey wheat crust and the tostada pizza to both be great. Both are veggie friendly pizzas (provided your local establishment doesn't use anchovies in the ranch for the tostada), and they're both off the hook amazing. The tostada is especially awesome. A layer of beans, crunchy lettuce and tomatoes, ranch, and crispy tortilla strips bring it all together in a wonderful combination. Tip: they're glad to actually make you any pizza that they have the ingredients for and/or modify any pizza to add/remove any items from them, since they're making everything from scratch. Keeping in mind that there may be a charge involved for different ingredients, go nuts with all the combinations you can make! This is especially helpful for vegetarians since a lot of the pizzas just have 1 or 2 non-veg items and taste just as great without them or even with substitute ingredients. My one gripe was how long the food took, and that our pizzas were merely warm by the time they got to us, but I guess that it may have just been a one-off incident, so I'm not too concerned about it.
