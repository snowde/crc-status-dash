100,Ryan W.,"Portland, OR",36,16,,1.0,2012-04-04,"Don't waste your time: Try Cibo, Pizzeria Bianco, Hannys, Z Pizza or even Oreganos. All gourmet pizza with local fare and local products and I've never had an experience like: I had lunch CPK this afternoon and had a less than desirable experience and I wanted to share it with you. Long-story-short, we ordered the Thai Chicken Pizza without cilantro. The pizza arrived with cilantro. I had one bite after my partner had one piece. After the bite, I notified the server that there was cilantro. He was very accommodating, said that he requested it without cilantro and then hastily rectified the situation by ordering a different pizza.  While we were awaiting the second pizza, the manager arrived at our table to address the situation. He did not offer his name, but immediately apologized for the inconvenience which we appreciated. He, however, continued with informing us that there was no cilantro on the pizza. Then asked us, ""Did you not want scallions on there, because it was scallions on the pizza, not cilantro."" I informed him that I tasted and saw cilantro, which I had pointed out to the server. He replied with, ""No, they did not put any cilantro on the pizza!"" To which I replied, ""Well I don't know...I didn't put cilantro on the pizza."" To which he replied, ""Well, the new pizza will be here shortly,"" as he walked away. I have a few serious issues with this managerial approach. First, it is unprofessional to insinuate that any guest is lying. Second, I find it insulting that he would go on to insinuate that we don't know the difference between scallions and an herb we specifically requested be omitted. Finally, I believe arguing with the guest should be strictly avoided.

We had a very nice and attentive waiter who came back often (they divided the place between waitstaff very well) and made no mistakes. I chose a cherry limeade for my drink. I was glad to taste an actual lime flavor in a drink for once! Add in the cherry and...need I say more? My entreé was the Garlic Chicken pizza which ended up becoming a joke - in a good way (hhhhhello, hhhhhow's your pizza?). It was topped with loads of garlic, onions, and chicken. That's OK, though: I am an onion lover (as well as garlic). I wanted to try the seasonal Lemon Cake, but I was too darn full...next time. It took a bit of driving around the Biltmore Fashion Park to find it, but the extra time was worth it.

Every food I have tried at CPK has been nothing but yummy, but this waiter really ruins the dining experience. I give the food 5 stars, but I give my experience at this place 2 stars, all because this particular waiter screws up our orders consistently. One time, we ask for the bread..the bread never comes out, just our meals.  another time, I ask for extra sauce on the side of my salad, never came out another time, I asked for no peanuts in my salad - it was filled with peanuts this last time was the topper -  ordered an appetizer, and it never arrived. I also asked for no tortilla strips in my soup - it comes out loaded with tortilla strips. And when we got our bill at the end of lunch, we told him that our appetizer never came out because we wanted to make sure we didn't get charged for it, and he pulled out the order he had written and confirmed that it wasn't even written down! it's the same guy EVERY time - I don't know how this guy still works there and why I keep being the unfortunate one always falling into his area, but I am not dining at this location anymore - much too stressful",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-phoenix-2?start=80,3.36,3.36,3.36,3.24,3.3600000000000003

95,Bill B.,"Phoenix, AZ",221,310,6.0,2.0,2012-10-27,"Why does this place still exist? Back when Sizzler went out of business sometime in the mid-90's one marketing expert explained the reasons behind it like this: ""There was no longer any question people were asking to which the answer was 'Sizzler'"".  Soon after it lost relevance--and went through at least one bankruptcy-- the chain disappeared. CPK is a nicely-decorated facility at a great location, but besides being the only pizzeria in the Biltmore Fashion Park proper, there is very little reason to visit here. It's not the answer to any current question. The pizza is never better than so-so. The toppings are never really that fresh. The salads are an uninspired-though-nicely-arranged pile of iceberg and other ingredients that wouldn't seem extraordinary at Applebee's. In fact, i think Applebee's does salad better. The service tends to be a bit slow. The drinks are pricey. For all this indifferent straight-from-Sysco quality, you pay a premium price. It's probably been 10 years since this place has had any cachet that might justify the higher prices. Maybe longer. I think they might be hurting since the departure of Planet Hollywood, which itself brought a study stream of cornpone slackjaws impressed by a name--though not enough to keep it in business.

We were instantly helped and our server took our drink orders. He also asked if we wanted bread and oli which we declined (as we knew we'd be eating enough carbs). He promptly brought us our drinks and what I loved about it I ordered a flavored ice tea to which he suggested me trying before adding any sweetener in it as they use syrup to make the flavors. It was perfect as is. My boyfriend ordered a pepperoni pizza and the waiter wanted to make sure he was okay with the oregano and spicy pepperoni they now use (which he was), I had the chicken tequila fettuccine w/extra cilantro. As he was putting in the order he turned to just confirm I wanted extra cilantro which I did.  The manager brought our food over in less than 10 minutes and it was perfect!

We had never been here and decided to give it a try. We ordered a bowl of soup, Mac and cheese, as well as the Jambalaya to share. We told our server we wanted the Mac and cheese (Appetizer, not even realizing there was a main dish portion as well). He did not bother clarifying with us which one we were referring to. When the order arrived, we were surprise at the large size and made a comment to our server that this is a big portion, and that we thought it would be a smaller size. He said that this is the usual size, and did not bother clarifying that it was not the appetizer we had requested. When our bill came, we were surprised to see that the Mac and cheese had costed us $11 as opposed to $3.99 as stated in the appetizer section. We then informed our server of the mistake and miscommunication, and he agreed and went to rectify the miscommunication. Although this mistake happened, please note, we weren't at all upset at the server. We completely understood mistakes and miscommunications happen, and he had kind enough customer service skills to rectify the situation by changing our bill amount. The part that we were dissatisfied and very surprised by, was the actions of the manager on duty this evening (December 7th, around 8.30pm). This complaint is towards the manager. When the server when to correct the bill, the manager (or we think it was the manager) came out to our table and rudely asked 'what's going on, guys??'. We politely explained to her the situation, and she responded by saying, and I quote, 'so you want to eat the large size Mac and cheese, pack it (we did not finish it), and only pay for the appetizer Mac and cheese??'. We were so offended by her statement, and disbelief in her lack of customer service skills.

122,Amy F.,"Tucson, AZ",16,24,62.0,5.0,2017-02-03,"Overview: I recommend it.  Food: I ordered the Garlic Cream Fettuccine with shrimp (+$5) and The Works Pizza. The pasta is absolutely delicious. I would definitely come back here just for the pasta. I added chili flakes to my pasta since I like to eat thing spicy (not shown in my pics). As for the pizza, it was good too. But it's just the typical pizza. However, the pizza did came out a little but salty. I would still give it a 5 stars Customer service: customer service was average. We did waited for our check a bit longer than normal about 20 minutes after we were done eating. Even though it wasn't even busy at all. Nothing over the top or anything. Just regular service.  Other notes: When I got to the place and looked at other people's review, it did kind of made me feel like I need to check what's in my food. Some helpers have posted pics with bugs in their food. To be honest, sometimes things do fly into our food from the kitchen to the dining area. If a simple costumer service can take care of that then it shouldn't be an issue or have the service fix the issue. I know some places either just remake the food freshly or offer the meal for free to the customer. As long it is taken care of n to satisfy the customer, then I think it's appropriate. But definitely should check the food for anything odd lol.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-phoenix-2,3.12,3.43,3.43,2.9000000000000004,3.306

I voiced my concerns on my survey and Yelp because my husband and I have always enjoyed our visits to CPK and thought they should know.  Management took the feedback seriously and appear to have made some changes since last visit. This time we ordered the tortilla soup and baked potato soup. I'm not usually a fan of potato soups, but we would definitely order it again!  We ordered our favorite avocado rolls which I have to say these were the best ones we had to date and better than last time - they were incredibly fresh and vibrant.  My husband ordered the Thai pizza. I'm usually a traditional style pizza lover, but had a taste and have to say it was surprisingly amazing. It reminds me of chicken satay on pizza. I ordered the works which was delicious! Lots of oregano and veggies and meat. The crust was perfect and crispy and light on both pizzas. We really wanted to get to dessert, but didn't even make it through the pizzas. Leftover CPK pizza is the best. Our waiter this time was phenomenal, his name is Joel, make sure you get him. He is very considerate, personable, and helpful. He is attentive when it comes to removing dishes and makes sure food gets out to you right away.  Thank you Camelback CPK team for a great visit.

We were celebrating his mom of course, & myself as I'm pregnant with our first baby. We had a reservation & were seated with no problems. They seemed busy but there were still open tables the entire time we dined. We had two waitresses & at first everything was going smoothly. Got our drinks quickly, orders placed once all the menus were closed. I've been to other CPK's & across the board the food is good. Tonight I ordered the Garlic Cream Fettuccine + mushrooms. It was exactly what I wanted! After dinner we ordered 3 desserts & all were delicious! The reason I'm giving 1 star is because of the service. One waitress, Ryan, was really great! Friendly, personable & helpful! The other, Ray, came by at some point to ask if we needed anything else & if we wanted dessert. My husband asked if she could take some of the empty plates & told her we would definitely get dessert but we'd wait until his mom was done eating. She took a couple plates as she ROLLED HER EYES! I couldn't believe it. It was so incredibly rude! Everyone at the table witnessed it & it was extremely uncomfortable. My husband was not being unkind by any means. We were there to enjoy the holiday, we planned to & did stay a long time. I don't know if she took offense to his request or his answer to her question, that yes we would be ordering dessert? But being so outrightly unprofessional & to our faces, was uncalled for. As dinner went on service became slower & less available.

What a disappointment.  When three other restaurants in the vicinity had a 40+ minute wait due to Father's Day, this store was empty. Maybe four tables were occupied. We found a nice spot and proceeded to order a glass of wine. After waiting 15 minutes and told the wine would arrive anytime on 4 different occasions, the waitress said they were looking for a wine glass. Really??? There were maybe 10 people in the restaurant over 21. So we proceeded to order our food not having the wine delivered.  After waiting an obnoxiously long time our food finally arrived as did the wine. We were told they had to wash the wine glass. The split pea and tortilla soups were coagulated beyond a stew and not edible! The wonton chicken and avocado wraps were horrible at best and tasted even worse than they appeared and my ""go-to"" half barbecue chicken chopped salad  was disgusting. What happened CPK?  What happened to the high energy vibe, shiny clean environment, efficient staff and consistent food?  I couldn't even find a manager after asking for one.
