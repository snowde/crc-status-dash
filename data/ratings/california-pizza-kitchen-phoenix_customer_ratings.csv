88,Christa B.,"Phoenix, AZ",77,6,,2.0,2012-05-20,"My son and I visited CPK Desert Ridge on May 12th after a movie at the AMC. I recall eating at a CPK at The Mirage in Las Vegas over 18 years ago and I remember it being good and kinda the latest trend. We were promptly greeted and seated. The host was great. HOWEVER, It was at least 15 mins. before any waiters acknowledged us. When one did, she wasn't our waiter but said she would give our drink order to our waiter. Probably 2 mins later our waiter came with our drinks FINALLY. We placed our order immediately in hopes of eating sometime in this decade. Since it had been so long since I'd eaten at a CPK, I asked the waiter if one pizza was enough for 2 people and he said no. So we ordered two, one kinda traditional pizza with pep, sausage etc and one chicken tostada pizza. I'd guess 10 mins passed by the time our food came, with which we were pleased. When I saw how big they were, I was kinda surprised. We would have been more than full on one pizza. But I can't fault the waiter for that. He had no way of knowing if we are big eaters or not. We dug in. I first had a slice of the chicken tostada. My son, the meat pizza. Mine was ""okay"" not a whole lot of flavor even with the salsa. My son's however was really yummy. I ended up having a slice of his since he was raving about it. He then had a slice of mine and he said the same thing, kinda boring and no taste. We ended up leaving with 2 half pizzas. I'm sure I would have given them a better score had it not been for the slowness of the waiter checking on us. Would I go back, yes, but I'd ask to be seated in the large dining room, not off to the side where we were seated, I'm sure that is why we were ignored for so long.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-phoenix?start=100,3.24,3.24,3.24,3.1440000000000006,3.2400000000000007

100,Marc T.,"Scottsdale, AZ",522,129,361.0,3.0,2013-02-02,"Going into this restaurant, I had really high hopes. I mean, I've had their personal pizzas on multiple occasions while waiting in the airport. So, I knew the food would be good. It only stands to reason that the actual restaurant would be nothing short of amazing, right? Sadly, no. My daughter and I decided to stop in after a nice long play date nearby. When we arrived, it was 2:00 in the afternoon. The restaurant was almost completely empty. We were immediately seated, which was nice. From there, however, things kind of went downhill. Once we were seated, we sat...and waited...and waited. In a restaurant where there were FAR more servers than there were patrons, you'd figure that the service would have been a little better.  But, here's the kicker. Since the place was so empty, it made overhearing conversations among the servers pretty easy. As we sat and waited for someone to come and see us, I could overhear the servers arguing over who was going to help us. I know what you're thinking...maybe they were seeing whose turn it was for fairness' sake. No, these servers might as well have been drawing straws to see who got the short one. Nothing like feeling like a burden to set your dining mood. All of that time to sit and think ended up shedding some light on another negative thing. The plates they provided at the table still had some food caked on them. Had I not had all of that free time to sit and look around, I might not have noticed it as readily.  As expected, the food was still fantastic. We went the safe route and got the margherita pizza. Thin crust, and delicious! Our pizza ended up being plenty for two of us to share, and only set us back about $16 with two drinks. I really wish I could rate this place higher, because I really do enjoy their pizza. But my experience with the service was downright unpleasant. I'll stick to picking up their personal pizzas from the airport. That way I know I'll be getting a good pizza, but I won't have to worry as much about unexpected shoddy service. I mean, it's almost to be expected when you order fast food...so at least it won't be a surprise.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-phoenix?start=60,3.56,3.56,3.56,3.1800000000000006,3.5600000000000005

I kind of wanted to stay away from here for the longest time after I started seeing their pizzas in the frozen aisle at the grocery store.  I figured they probably just had frozen pizzas in the back and they reheated it.  Maybe that is the case. I'm not sure. But it still tastes good.

Anyway, we got there after a movie, Saturday night around 8:30pm. We got there and no one was by the door, but a young hostess quickly approached us and I promise she seemed honestly happy to see us : ) We asked for a booth and got one of the 2 person ones. We don't like those much because we like sitting next to each other, we stayed there but mainly what I didn't like is that there is no wall and there is no privacy if someone else is seating on the other side of the divider. Our server approached us and took our drink orders, we were not ready to order and she had to come back a couple of times. After that service was a little slow but she was nice and friendly. Hubby had water and I had the cranberry cooler (cranberry juice with seltzer water, free refills). She was very prompt with the refills.  Appetizers - We had the lettuce wraps with chicken, they were really good, with shiitake mushrooms and water chestnuts. Hubby had the garlic foccaccia bread and it was very good too. Then we decided to share a Jambalaya, with the shrimp on the side because hubby does not like shrimp. It sounded really good because it comes with chicken, shrimp, craw fish and Andouille sausage. Pasta was a little undercooked for my taste, and our server offered to order a new one, but we were in a little hurry and decided to just keep it. I thought the Jambalaya had an overwhelming spice, but I do not know what it was. IT was OK though, not awesome. The shrimp, on the other hand, was very tasty and I liked it a lot.

They did switch to sourdough bread for a start - not my favorite but theirs isn't too powerful.  I liked the herb oil but that didn't get to our table with the last visit so it might be out already. Parking is easy, at least until they replace On the Border which is across the ""street"" and the best place to park when you visit.  Service is mostly good but we have had a couple of bad experiences, not enough to change my opinion though.  Ask for salad dressing on the side if you're concerned about getting too much, I'm not a fanatic but they load it at times and it will turn a nice salad into a drippy slaw.  The guy that manages this place during the day does a great job and always looks tired, I would too if I had to deal with running a place like this.

CPK isn't bad, it's just not worth its exorbitant price. And God forbid you want something extra. There's an up charge for everything. $2.75 for a couple chunks of avocado in my salad.  I know a restaurant has overhead costs, but how about I grab a whole one from said grocery store for less? As for the pizza; the quality is just okay and thanks to the millions of imitators that have improved on the concept of nontraditional toppings, the chain is not as unique as it seemed 20 years ago. Every place in the US now has a signature BBQ Chicken Pizza. So why does CPK get three stars? I'll give the chain credit for its easy online ordering, curbside pickup, and friendly staff.

The last time we went there was to take my family out to dinner..they just flew in from out of state.  Imagine my excitement to take them to a good meal.  As soon as we saw him I knew we were doomed.  We should have walked out or just said flat out we wanted to be in a section where he was not serving (which I've never had to do before).  We ordered 2 appetizers and 5 main dishes (2 mahi mahi tacos, 2 Thai chicken pizzas and ribeye steak).  We were awaiting for our food quite a while and then we sensed it... He was going to bring the appetizer WITH the meal.  After a 20 minute wait (the restaurant was not busy) appetizer is brought to the table and 10 seconds later the main course.  We all kept quiet except my husband who asked 'isn't the appetizer supposed to be brought with the meal?' To which Our delusional waiter replied oh so arrogantly 'it is if you specify'.  Oh..was it MY job as the paying customer to SPECIFY?  I didn't know I worked at CPK! Anywhere where else I've been (and I've been to A LOT of restaurants in the US and overseas) the appetizers are brought in first or THEY ASK if I wanted it brought out first or with the the meal.  I thought that was THEIR JOB and not mine.  The Tuscan hummus and the lettuce wraps were not fresh by the time they served it by the way and we didn't even touch the latter dish.  My dad had ordered the ribeye which they seemed to be so proud of but that was eclipsed by the LACK OF SERVICE from our so called waiter.   He did not bother asking how we liked our meal...it was the manager who checked on us.  He also did not bother refilling our drinks..my sister had to flag down another waiter because our waiter was working the bar chatting it up with co workers.   The next time our waiter came by he dropped off the desert menu..that was it. I usually tip 20 to 25 percent.  Our bill was $108 dollars and I left a 16 dollar tip which was too much for what service he failed to do.   So this guy (I think his name was narcissus?)  has managed to tarnish my impression of this restaurant.  The next time if we ever go back.. We WILL ask to be seated at a different section where he is not serving.  The other 4 different waiters we've had were very competent.

The pizza at California Pizza Kitchen was exotic and delicious.  It had various things on the pizza that would not usually be put on pizza.  My grandfather had a pizza called a Thai pizza that had Thai chicken, bean sprouts, ginger, garlic, carrots, greens, cheese, and peanut sauce.  My pizza was the roasted garlic chicken pizza.  I do have to say that the chicken on my pizza was a little bit dry I think it could've been marinated a little more.  My onions were caramelized but I think that they could have been in the pan a little bit longer.  Other than that my pizza was great.  I recommend it.                       California Pizza Kitchen's kid's menu has lots of options. The menu has various options including Hawaiian pizza, mac and cheese, hot dog, and more. Kid's menu orders come with the inexpensive option of an ice cream sundae.                       The pizzas at CPK are sized for one person so that everyone can have their own or share several.                        The ambiance at CPK is modern and upbeat but not overwhelming.

I gave them 24 hour notice ordered five pizzas one salad dessert tray and service for 12 -my daughter went to pick it up at the specific time- I actually called 20 minutes before to confirm- they were not on time but that was OK- when my daughter got it to my home I saw that the dessert tray was not included nor was any of the paper goods that were promised- very frustrating - and I'm fortunately the pizzas don't taste good - love salads and brownies - which we did not get it till later but those darn pizzas just don't taste very good- when I called initially be argued with me that I did not order a dessert tray but then eventually someone said so sorry you can pick it up anytime just very frustrating I don't think I will use them anymore for catering,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-phoenix?start=20,3.4,3.4,3.4,2.5960000000000005,3.4000000000000004

In honor of National Sangaria day we tried the sampler flight. It's was good but very sweet. Was good to share! They also serve complimentary bread and oil with some herbs that is very good.  I got the roasted chicken with seasonal vegetables and it was incredible! Chicken was made to perfection with a crisp skin and had a garlic, lemon, wine sauce. I didn't want it to end!!! Amazing healthier option with a ton of flavor. My brother in law got the cedar wood salmon and it was delicious. We got a variety of options that were also good such as pizza, salad, pasta, and cheese crisp.  We finished off the night with the butter cake with ice cream on top for my mother in laws birthday. It was like heaven in your mouth. I don't think I have ever tasted anything so amazing. It was perfect to pass around the table and have a few bites but honestly I could of ate the whole thing. But moderation is key... lol Overall great experience and I am excited to go back. Highly recommend trying the roasted chicken and the butter cake if you have a sweet tooth.

They were quite tasty and a meal in and of themselves. We shared the Works pizza. It was hot, fresh, and perfect. I love a nice crispy crust. Our server was attentive and kept our drinks refilled.

Due to hectic traffic on a Friday evening  it almost put our plans in jeopardy. I  had already purchased the tickets so if dinner was gonna happen we'd need to expedite it quickly. The girls were in the mood for pizza, so we decided on California Pizza Kitchen at Desert Ridge. because we were in a hurry the counter seemed like a great option. We were not disappointed by this decision in the slightest. We were greeted promptly by the bartender Laura. Laura was sweet and kind giving extra attention to my girls. My youngest daughter has a wheat allergy and Laura took care of her needs supplying a gluten free menu and suggesting appropriate options. We were then greeted by the manager Craig. Craig was very busy helping put together some Togo orders but that did not stop him from personally checking with every guest in the area to ensure that there experience was outstanding in every way possible. Craig also interacted with my girls making there experience a great one. Laura  had the bar and what looked like a couple of tables as well.  She was very attentive , met and exceeded our expectations. Thank you both for helping make this daddy daughter date special.

The pizzas are always pretty solid, but at this price point, Picazzos is a better option.

Desert Ridge CPK customer service was infinitely better- we worked with Chelsie, one of the assistant managers, who was professional and responsive to all of our emails and phone calls. On the day of our event, the CPK staff was very efficient and prompt with their service, and the pizzas and ice cream sundae were excellent- the kids were all smiles and loved their meal! Thank you Desert Ridge CPK, and thank you Chelsie for all of your help in making our daughter's birthday special. It is evident this location takes pride in what they do.

Recently my friend and I went and ordered. I wanted to get a sundae but instead gave us the check instead. And also gave us one check instead of separate checks which was a little annoying because they didn't give me a chance to order dessert. Anyways we had two waiters so I was confused on who was our actual waist but it took the 20 minutes to pick up our check and during that time I was trying to get their attention to ask for a sundae and separate checks.

Our service was excellent so no complaints there.  But the food is not very good.  I got a lunch pizza/salad combo.  It was only $11.99 but it should have been less.  The pizza was very small and the salad was tiny.  I was very unimpressed! Things to note:  Their 'famous' BBQ chicken pizza tastes Exactly like the one you can buy in the frozen section at most grocery stores.  I'll save my money and just purchase it there if I get a craving. The pizza tasted VERY pre-made, the chicken even reminded me of that already cooked chicken you can buy with the lunch meat at the store.  Thankfully it was doused in BBQ sauce to mask the flavor. The Caesar salad I had issue with as well. My number one pet peeve with a Caesar salad is when they do not dress the salad, but rather serve it on the side.  That is not the way a Caesar is to be served.  Let alone the fact that they give you maybe a tbsp of dressing...not nearly enough.  I ate almost half the salad dry without dressing.  So essentially I just way overpaid for dry lettuce. I was not pleased. I walked away feeling like I spent way too much money for a very mediocre lunch.  I'm not going to come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-phoenix,3.36,3.46,3.46,,3.4200000000000004

We would ask our waitress for the simple things such as a refill or a drink and it would take 10+ minutes to get the job done. The manager had to come and check on us which shouldn't be the case at all. It was to the point that when we were done with our food we had to stack the plates and put them to the side because they sat in front of us for 20+ minutes. On top of it all, we asked for a box and that even took long. We had to ask for our check instead of having our check giving to us. We literally had to demand stuff to get out of this restaurant.

Erika Elizabeth was truly the most entertaining, friendly and family oriented waitress I've ever had! She made bad food situations an easy transition by offering other options. We understand she is not the chef so she is not to blame. But the food that night was completely disappointing, that would be considered at 2/5 stars. My family ordered salad and the lettuce tasted like metal and super bland, the soup was clumpy and luke warm. But even with that being said, she made the experience truly comical and friendly.

This location was located in a beautiful shopping and dining area called the district. Being Friday night, the parking lot was packed and traffic was heavy, but we didn't mind. It was to be expected. California Pizza Kitchen has always been a go to place of ours when we want something we know will be yummy and worth our money. As soon as we walked in, the Hostess Laura greeted us warmly and sincerely. Her demeanor was calm but confident, and her smile was contagious. As she showed us to the table, she actually took the time to ask us how we were enjoying our evening and make pleasant conversation. She waited till we were seated to hand us our menus (loved that!) explained how it was free to join their rewards program, and that David our server would be right with us. David was absolutely incredible!! Super friendly and funny from the beginning. He was professional and knew the menu very well, but also made you feel comfortable. He recommended an Alaskan lager instead of the Sam Adams Winter lager because they didn't have it for my boyfriend. He loved it! And a strawberry sweetened ice tea for myself. It was out of this world! Definitely getting it every time I go from now on lol. He checked on us often, refilled our drinks, and made sure our meal was tasting great when it arrived. It was delicious as always of course. My boyfriend had the jambalaya and I had the pesto cream penne. David also took the time to add our meal to my boyfriends rewards credit after he had signed up.
