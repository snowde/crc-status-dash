24,Quay M.,"Austin, TX",165,203,3.0,3.0,2012-07-30,"Out of all of the CPK that I have visited this one is definitely my favorite. The staff is friendly and the pizzas are usually pretty spot on. My favorite appetizers there are the Asparagus & Arugula Salad (so light yet so tasty!), White Corn Guacamole & Chips (super delicious!), Sesame Ginger Chicken Dumplings (seriously so good), and Lettuce Wraps. Sometimes I just order all four of those instead of a meal. Outside of those apps/small plates, I have only had a few of their pizzas: the Margherita and Roasted Garlic Chicken are the only two I remember lol (hey, it's been awhile!). The margherita has been great majority of the times that I have ordered it. The roasted garlic chicken did not sit well with me. The garlic taste was way overpowering because they have rather large pieces of cloves scattered throughout the pizza. Imo, I love garlic, but it should be kept to a minimum as the flavor is incredibly intense. Drinks-wise CPK does alright, nothing special. I wouldn't go just for drinks, I should say. There are a few places I would put ahead of them. Anyway, if you're in Ross Park Mall and hungry this is definitely a better pick than anything else in the mall, including the Cheesecake Factory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pittsburgh-2?start=40,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005

I believe that I've eaten at this location three times over the last several years. I've only ever had pizza here - Pear Gorgonzola, Hawaiian BBQ, and White Cheese. All three of these pizzas were delicious. I'm actually dreaming of the White Pizza right now!  Service has been OK. The wait time has never been quick, but I've also never become irritated by the wait... maybe 30 minutes or so.  Even though CPK isn't as exciting as a local, hole-in-the-wall type pizza place, they consistently deliver good food with descent service at a moderate price.

Recently ate here on a Friday night after some light shopping. The atmosphere is just great. It can be romantic, or good for catching up with friends and family. Good for every occasion! Although I didn't get a glass this time, I would like to say that their white sangria is AMAZING. It might be the best I've ever tasted! I crave it regularly! We were seated by a manager, who told us to grab him if we needed anything. He was friendly and professional. Normally, the servers here are super attentive and very professional, too. They are trained to pour in front of you, which is a nice touch. Our waiter this time was very Spanish, spoke a hundred miles a minute, and was very hard to understand. He was very nice though, but not completely attentive. He looked a little overwhelmed even though there weren't many tables in his section. I have had better service at this location before. I got a 5 cheese pizza and Tom got a California Club sandwich, which he loved. My pizza was good, as usual. Ate the whole thing! I also signed up for their rewards by getting the app on my phone. I got a free small plate (like a smaller appetizer) just for signing up!  I have heard that they are known for their butter cake dessert, but I prefer to go next door to the Cheesecake Factory and get a piece of cheesecake to go instead! :) Overall: Go check it out!

For me, the only problem I ran into here was that when we entered the hostess was MIA.  Making us stand in a line for only about five minutes.  After that little hold up, it was smooth sailing. My friend and I opted to sit at the bar instead of taking up a table...good choice on our part.  Upon sitting down we were greeted by the bartender promptly, I believe his name was Brian (if I'm wrong, I apologize to you sir).  We were asked what we wanted to drink and given some menus.  While looking over the menus my friend and I decided to partake in an adult beverage.  I stayed with what I knew and had a beer, my friend had their berry sangria.  His words for the taste, ""It's like drinking Kool-Aid.""  After that we ordered an appetizer.  Opting for the sesame ginger chicken dumplings.  The mixture of flavors were very good.  The addition of scallions to a bite made the flavors pop even more. We were still debating on what pizza to get when our appetizer had arrived.  Upon asking the bartender what his thoughts were about ordering just one pizza and he said that with an appetizer, it should be enough; he was right.  We got the Sicilian, and my god was it good.  It was a mixture of meats, mozzarella, and a spicy marinara sauce.  I believe we had it made sitting at the bar too.  Once the pizza arrived the bartender said since we were sitting there, the pizza chef put a little extra toppings on there for us.  I mean, when you sit at the bar, you get to see all the food being made.  So thumbs up to you pizza chef (he had also said that making the Sicilian was one of his favorites to make).   Overall, the experience I had here will definitely warrant a return visit. Points to note: outdoor seating during warmer months, they take reservations (so call ahead if you know it will be busy), Entrances from both outside and inside the mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pittsburgh-2?start=20,3.184,3.184,3.184,3.184,3.184

From an overview of the other reviews, it seems that service here can be a give or take, but coming in on a Sunday afternoon revealed a pretty calm atmosphere and overall attentive service by our waiter.  From the start we were taken in, as the manager, upon finding out it was our first time there, offered us a flat bread on the house. They had several kinds, and the spinach and mushroom that we got was delicious. As for the pizza, we only tried the California Club this time, which was almost like a salad on top of the pie, and a very hearty one at that.

1,Casey N.,"Pittsburgh, PA",114,116,126.0,3.0,2014-11-24,"I had always had this impression that they only served pizza, and nothing else. I was totally wrong! I recently moved by the Ross Park Mall so I decided to finally give them a shot. First time I had the meat cravers thin crust pizza. This was delicious! For some reason I just love salami on pizza. It goes so good with pepperoni, and this pizza has that! It was a very unique taste and look of the pizza and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I give that pizza 5 stars!! I would go back for more of the thin crust options, as I love a crispy thin pizza and not many places have that! Second time I was here was a little less appetizing. I ordered the original BBQ chicken chopped salad. The actual salad part with all the yummy veggies, cheese, and dressing was delicious and I would certainly get it again, but the ""chicken"" was completely gross. I don't really know what they did to it or where it came from but I honestly don't think it was fresh chicken breast, it was almost comparable to a subway quality chicken. Don't get me wrong, that type of chicken is fine, but for a $12-$14 salad, I would expect warm, freshly grilled chicken. This chicken was cold and just not appetizing. So word of advise, ask for fresh grilled chicken if that's what you really want on your salad! Service and atmosphere is good and it is a nice bright restaurant. Always very clean!  I am sure I will give them another try in the future, as that pizza was good, and I will remember to ask for the good chicken!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pittsburgh-2?start=20,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.9880000000000004,3.2800000000000002

I've had fond memories of delicious dinner dates at cpk, loving almost all of their entrées from pasta, pizza to salads. I had lunch there today after over a year. The husband got what he always loved here, the pear & gorgonzola pizza and I got the veggie grilled sandwich with tortilla soup and Mediterranean veggie rolls for appetizers. I have to say, the food was nearly inedible. The soup was a thick mushy blend of something that didn't sit right with me every time I took a bite, as if they put whatever leftovers they had and blended it. The sandwich was soggy. The med veggie rolls were just baked tortillas rolled up with cheese inside and served with marinara sauce from a jar, and the pear & gorgonzola pizza also didn't taste fresh.

47,Tina B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",132,323,607.0,3.0,2016-06-08,"Pizza is pretty good, but way too overpriced. And with all honesty, the restaurant also kind of smelled like an old dish rag. Came here on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't busy at all, but probably because we came in between lunch and dinner so I imagine we just missed the rush. We were seated by the entrance right by the host/hostess table and we could hear all the loud conversations of the recently out of school college kids who work there. Not ideal but you can't really blame them since it was a slow afternoon. My husband and I each got our own pizzas. I got the Hawaiian and he got The Works, each around $15. The size of the pizzas were pretty large, but not large enough to share between two people. If you were to share a pie, I would highly recommend also getting appetizers. But getting a pie to yourself will probably be enough with maybe a few slices to take home. My favorite part of the pizza was the crust, which was thin, but not too thin, and crispy yet slightly chewy. Otherwise, the flavor was kind of average. For $15 a pie, I was expecting a bit more than average.  I enjoyed the pizza but probably not enough to justify spending that much. However, it's a nice option when you've spent a long day shopping and need a sit down meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pittsburgh-2,3.44,3.44,3.44,,3.4400000000000004
53,Funtime P.,"Pittsburgh, PA",42,307,1031.0,3.0,2016-06-20,I went here for the second time the first time I thought the food was mediocre. I ordered an appetizer with corn salsa. It was professionally made and looked nice but was flavorless and tasted cheap. I ordered a pizza with pears and walnuts which was made beautifully but tasted bitter and more earthy like green tea. The items are made well and look good but don't taste that great.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pittsburgh-2,3.36,3.36,3.36,,3.3600000000000003

We were greeted promptly by our server who was fantastic throughout the whole meal. Very courteous and attentive! I started with a small plate of Asparagus + Arugula Salad which was too good to be only 180 calories. I love anything that's healthy and delicious! The vinaigrette was great - sweet but not overpowering. The Shaved Mushroom + Spinach Flatbread was tasty but average quality, in my opinion. It was very crispy and the veggies were cooked well, but it was a bit oily.  Overall, I really enjoyed my meal; however, I would agree that their food is overpriced for the quantity and quality. Sure, it's not the best food you'll ever taste in your life but it sure hits the spot if you need a quick pizza fix.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pittsburgh-2,3.36,3.36,3.36,,3.3600000000000003

(Ask the server or manager for their special allergy menu or verified gluten free menu for more details if you want/need.)

Unfortunately this time the spinach and artichoke dip appetizer was fairly cold when we got it... and it even came out pretty quickly. The taste was also nothing special.

Then I remembered I have a 14-month old child in tow, there is no respite EVER. All kidding aside, they staff were very accommodating with us and our feisty toddler. Our waiter was also super sweet with our little girl. We made a lunch out of appetizers and ordered a plain cheese pizza off the kids menu for the baby.  I had flatbread with Brussels sprouts and bacon which was DELISH.  The crispy mac n' cheese was enjoyed by both adults and baby. AND the kids cheese pizza was very good, even if baby girl preferred her cheerios and milk, I enjoyed it. Would definitely go back next time we're at the mall and in the mood for table service.

Food: We ordered pepperoni pizza and chicken fettuccini. Both were good although the flavor of the fettuccini dish wasn't as light as it should have been.  Although it wasn't a cream sauce it came off as needlessly heavy. We wouldn't order that again.  Service: Initially was good until I received a refill that was a Diet Coke instead of regular. Then it took about 10 minutes to get my pizza boxed. But the worst part of the experience was paying for the check. Within minutes of initially sitting down I informed my waiter I would be using Mobile Pay, CPK's new feature where you can create a tab via the app and pay for your meal right from the table. He acknowledged it, I gave him the code to link to my tab in-app, and I thought we were set. Once we were finished, paid, then exited, he comes running out accusing (not asking) me of not paying. I told him I used the app, and he says, 'no, you didn't.' At this point I'm getting angry because 1) don't tell me what I didn't do. He may not have seen or been privy (even though he should have been), but he cannot attest to what I did. 2) I showed him the receipt in the app and all of a sudden it comes to him.

You know EPKs can be cool but this one never will be. CPK is wickedly overpriced, for a start. It's popular in towns with sh** pizza like Los Angeles, San Diego, Austin and Seattle. That should tell you a lot. It's some of the less good pizza I've had. It's actually more like NY Style, but a bad version of it. It's overpriced, overrated, and a corporate national chain taking business away from the little local places, such as in this case, Fiori's and Aiello's. I don't get why people like it so much, but they do, so maybe you will too. All 3 of the people I ate it here in Pitt with, it was their first time trying it. It was not my first time.

She no longer works at the mall so we don't have a change to visit as much as we used too.  This location has always been busy. I suggest getting there early and expect to wait in a short line, because they do not take reservations. For being here several times, I find nothing impressive nor disappointing, average experience at best. We order mostly pizza and salad. We do love the crispy Mac-Cheese appetizer. It was the first time we tried it and loved it, sadly every restaurant now offers it and makes it not a novelty any longer.  We have had the Pepperoni hand tossed pizza. We have ordered the ""Works"" as well; Italian Sausage, Pepperoni, Mushrooms, Mozzarella Cheese, Onion, Green Peppers, NO Olives. We have ordered the Mushroom, Peppers, Sausage. We have always had our pizza with a Field Green half Salad to split.  I love Key Lime Pie, I make it a mission to seek out the very best. I don't care for California Pizza Oven's pie. I can't speck of the Pasta, I have never tried it, other have said it was good but nothing special about it. I do agree with others post, it is a bit overpriced for what you receive. The food is good without a doubt, but not worth the price. We have used gift cards, which has helped to offset some of the price. The service is good and friendly and I have never had a bad experience. It does take forever to get a refill or a box or your check, we learned the first time to ask for the check as soon as they drop off the food, and remind them of a box when they bring back the bill. They do offer a mobile app which looks interesting, but I have no need for it, we don't visit often.

Consistency in food is something this particular location does well, which is always important.  Non-pizza items I have enjoyed: asparagus & arugula salad, bianco flatbread (ok, sort of pizza-y), chicken lettuce wraps, California fields salad (Fresh watermelon, strawberries and field greens with our housemade Champagne vinaigrette, Feta, basil and California pistachios), oven-roasted turkey and brie sandwich (Roasted turkey breast, warm Brie, shaved Bosc pears and baby greens with housemade honey-mustard), and the California club sandwich.

My husband was able to choose from 13 different items on a special Veterans Day menu. He went with the Hawaiian Pizza. Surprisingly (not!) he ate the whole thing. Said it was good. I never tried so I'm going to go with that! I was so looking forward to getting my favorite pizza of all time, the Pear and Gorgonzola. I almost cried when it wasn't on the menu!! Our waiter said it had been gone for a few months already. If the powers that be are reading this review I demand you bring that pizza back. PLEASE BRING BACK THE PEAR AND GORGONZOLA PIZZA!!!! I went with the spinach and roasted artichoke pizza instead. It was good, but not as good as the other one. It had a very, very thin and crispy crust and there was one piece of artichoke on each slice of the pizza. I would have preferred more, but that's what I got. That as well as the spinach was layered over a well thin spread of CPK's spinach artichoke dip which is one of their appetizers. I did like it though and wouldn't hesitate to reorder. For an app we went with the Avocado Club Egg Rolls. People, these are amazing. Every time I get them I think they couldn't be this good, but they are. I insist you try them. My husband is not really an avocado fan and even he thinks they are awesome!  The are stuffed with amazing goodness and deep fried in a crispy wonton. Dip these puppies in the ranchito sauce, a little bit spicy, and you have one of these best bites to go in your mouth.
