27,Tommy H.,"Carrollton, TX",220,120,76.0,3.0,2012-02-15,"We were in Willow Bend mall at dinner time and I didn't really want the food court, so California Pizza Kitchen seemed like a good full service alternative. We were seated right away and got prompt service. The waitress explained several times on the menu since we hadn't been to CPK enough to know the ins and outs. Harry got a basic pepperoni pizza with extra pepperoni on the whole grain honey wheat crust. I got the chipotle chicken, also on the whole grain crust. They were both good, but nothing special. We had a very talkative group of teenagers behind us with one parent chaperoning, so the noise level was a bit distracting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plano-2?start=40,2.8920000000000003,2.8920000000000003,2.8920000000000003,2.8920000000000003,2.892000000000001
39,Jessica N.,"Bellaire, TX",211,429,308.0,3.0,2012-02-19,"CPK is a-ok in my book! For the price of the pizza,  you don't get a big portion but it's just right for two people who aren't ravenously hungry.  I really like their honey wheat crust -  it's very grainy and adds great texture to the pizza! I also love how they let you have half orders of different kinds of pizza - I'm big on trying new things and being indecisive, so this option was perfect for me.  Tonight I shared a half wild mushroom pizza and a  half spicy chipotle chicken pizza.  The crust was brushed with oil, which is more grease than I prefer but it wasn't a crazy amount. I liked the mild flavor of the mushroom pizza and the meatiness that those delectable little fungi added.  The chipotle chicken pizza was quite spicy and came with a great corn salad on top.  At first, I didn't think three pieces could fill me up but they surely did! Split two ways, this was a very affordable meal, but it could easily add up with appetizers and drinks and desserts, so just keep that in mind! The service was good - our server was polite and prompt, but didn't keep an eye on our waters so I was yearning for another glass after I had some of that fiery chipotle pizza! Other than that, they did a great job and I would definitely recommend coming here if you need a place to rest your feet after shopping up a storm at Willow Bend!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plano-2?start=40,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003

I  have heard good things about this place but when it came around to it, I never went. So, after a long overdue trip, I finally made it out to try CPK. The food over all was okay, not great, not bad. I started off with the Southwestern style Egg roll which was okay, I'm not really knocking them for the appetizer as what I really wanted to try way the pizza for obvious reasons. On a number of peoples recommendation, I ordered the BBQ chicken pizza (I'm not sure if that's the actual name of the pizza) but I was not impressed, It was okay at best. The BBQ sauce was way too overpowering and didn't have the flavor that I was expecting. I'm not too sure what happened but I was definitely disappointed.

The house bread they bring out is hard in a stale way...so that was a bad start. So was the dirty silverware. The bianca(?) flatbread we started with was ok but I didn't like how pungent the cheese was. The chicken lettuce wraps were underwhelming, I can get better at Pei Wei. We asked for crispy chicken on our mac & cheese and they only threw a few little scratch chicken crisps on top so we had to ask for more actual pieces of chicken.

Unfortunately, when I went with my friend and our kids it was a definite miss. The restaurant was almost empty on a Saturday around lunch time (weird!) and we were seated immediately. I will say that the hostess was super nice! Then our waiter showed up and he instantly seemed irritated by us because we had kids with us. Hey, I get it, kids are messy and you don't want a bunch of crumb crushers at your table, but at least be polite? We ordered an appetizer and our drinks and the waiter disappeared and didn't show back up for about ten minutes. When he brought out the bianco flatbread we had ordered there were still no drinks, so we reminded him and then he didn't even apologize - just walked off without a word and came back with our drinks. I had put down a place mat for both our toddlers and made sure to cut up her food so she didn't make too big a mess. The other toddler didn't even eat. The bianco has a super strong basil flavor because each segment is cooked with a whole leaf on it, and so make sure you're pro-basil before you order it.  When we got the pizza it was the same issue. My drink had been empty for 5-10 mins, and our waiter had been completely absent from the dining room. It was so crazy quiet in there I had no idea why we weren't at least being checked on occasionally. When he came with the pizza I asked for a refill, same attitude. The white pizza was tasty but had a really powerful garlic taste that kind of overwhelmed the pizza, I hate to say that the frozen pizza version from CPK was actually better than the real thing at this location. Finally we were done and wanted to pay, and I ended up having to track down a different server to ask for the check. They told me they'd have to find our server, and so I described him.

He also asked us to pick a complimentary small plate and he would take care of it. We chose the Mac and cheese.

When the margarita came I was disgusted- there was a fruit fly in the top of the margarita.  I told our sever (who gave us great service by the way) and he took the drink, but didn't apologize, just said he would get me another one.  While we waited for my drink, the appetizer was yummy but I couldn't stop thinking about the fly in my margarita. My boyfriend joked and said I could use a little extra protein.  I got my new margarita and it was fabulous along with our pizza and chicken piccata dish.  To my dismay, when we got the bill, the fly margarita was still on there. I work in the restaurant industry and if anything like that would happen to a drink, I would comp it immediately and get the customer another drink.  we did get a very ""sad"" apology from the manager- sad meaning she acted like she didn't give two shits.  We probably won't be back because the whole paying for a drink with a fly in it left a bad taste in my mouth.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plano-2?start=20,3.28,3.28,3.28,,3.2800000000000002
12,Brandon B.,"Dallas, TX",88,41,147.0,5.0,2016-01-25,"""Alongside classics like the Original BBQ Chicken Pizza, highlights of CPK's new menu include a juicy Fire Grilled Ribeye cooked with house-made pinot noir sea salt, topped with creamy bleu cheese butter and served with roasted fingerling potatoes and lemon-garlic wild arugula salad. This ribeye was unexpected but not underwhelming; Tender, flavorful, juicy! Who knew a pizza kitchen would also have some of the first-rate steak? Another new favorite is the Hearth-Roasted Halibut, wild caught from Alaska and roasted on a cedar plank with butternut squash farro, grilled asparagus and baby kale. This is one of the most popular of the new menu items and after the first mouthful it is not hard to see why. The halibut is offset with the sweet butternut squash farro while the grilled asparagus and baby kale bring the fresh greens to the dish.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plano-2,3.32,3.32,3.32,,3.3200000000000003

They offer gluten-free options which is great for my toddler who has food allergies.  It's pristinely clean and serves as the perfect lunch spot after shopping around Willow Bend.

8,Vivian N.,"Richardson, TX",247,339,77.0,5.0,2016-07-26,"I rarely go to any restaurant for pizza let alone a pizza place, but CPK is an exception. There are many options here instead of just pizza. There's also salads, pasta, entrees, and appetizers. Also, the drinks are great. The staff is always super welcoming and nice. The food is always delicious and what's awesome is that they have many gluten free options. Just remember to ask for the gluten free menu since the main menu doesn't show many options.  I usually get pizzas since they're easier to eat and reheat as well. Some of my favorites are the Thai Chicken, the Margherita, and the Spicy Chipotle Chicken. The gluten free pizza crust is a little sweeter and chewier than the regular crust, but it's still pretty good. Their salads are also great. When I'm not feeling like scarfing down carbs, I'll get the Thai salad. Beware. The portions are huge. If you want left over salad for the next two days, go ahead and get the full. The drinks are good. My favorite is the bluberry ginger smash. It contains whiskey and is super sweet. I also love their Moscow mules, I mean what is there to dislike about Moscow mules? Overall, I would highly recommend this place. If you are looking for decent drinks and non classic pizzas, definitely stop by here. What's great is that it is connected to the mall which means that I can shop and stop by for dinner without having to drive around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plano-2,3.6,3.6,3.6,,3.6000000000000005

Today my mom went to pick up two salads- one with turkey and the other with no meat since my mom is vegetarian by religion.  This order was to go and it took over an hour for us to get the food and when we got the salads they both had meat. So they had to remake it. And the MANAGER, Will Wilson, is the one that came out to handle this order.  He complained to her ""is this an allergy or a preference?"" and my mom responded saying it is a preference. He responded it ""it's not going to KILL you"" with a sassy attitude.  He comes back with the order remade and my mom clarified that it has no meat again and he assured us with so my confidence that there was no meat. We come home and there is still chicken in her salad. He LIED. The manager LIED.  I called the store to speak to the manager to find out that he was the manager. He said it was not his fault and when things are made in the kitchen they get ""mixed up"" and I explained if it is an allergy or a preference the consumers request of no meat should still be met - not a response that it won't kill you.  Not only will my mom not be able to have her dinner, but we also had to deal with a rude, sassy manager.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plano-2,3.44,3.44,3.44,,3.4400000000000004
4,Vanessa W.,"Plano, TX",119,116,264.0,5.0,2017-02-26,"I always love the Plano location, it is definitely better than the frisco location in my opinion. Willowbend gets a lot less traffic than Stonebriar, so it's so much calmer and the service is better in this location. Service is always great, and if we are having any problems with food then the manager will step in and help us. We have had good experiences with the managers and staff members.  My favorite is the pepperoni, sausage, and mushroom pizza and overtime it has gotten a lot spicier! I am sensitive to spice, and I remember once having to take it back because I couldn't enjoy it. They haven't been as spicy lately but it still has a kick to it. They have also started to add a lot more oregano on the pizzas so I have to ask for light oregano. I love the wheat bread on the pizza, it has a nice sweet taste to it and of course it is a better option than the white bread. I always order a side of marinara with my pizza because I love dipping :) The drinks are expensive (around $9-10 each) but they are so delicious. Margaritas are always great (either frozen or on the rocks) and the Moscow Mule is great! Great spice and flavor, but a lot of ice!!  They renovated the restaurant a few years ago, and it has a much more hip and contemporary vibe.
