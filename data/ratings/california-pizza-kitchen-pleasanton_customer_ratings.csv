195,Beth Q.,"Oakland, CA",12,14,7.0,4.0,2012-01-02,"Yup! Not a big fan of pizza but cpk is the only exception. We went on a busy Monday night after new year. Place was pretty packed but  the wait wasn't so bad (original plan was to go to cheesecake factory to spend a gift card but wait time was way too long).. Resto has relaxing ambiance, simple decor, warm lights.. Staffs were polite and server not mia.  Anyhow menu-wise, i highly recommend:       Artichoke dip wit chips - served warm, chips not salty       Jamaican jerk pizza - spicy, sweet, hot. Bacon adds crisp and saltiness.       We also had chicken tequila fettuccine - it is worth trying but not my favorite amongst pasta selection.. Although I prefer this over the jambalaya pasta..  If u wanna try their signature original BBQ chicken pizza , i suggest having it on thin crust.. the BBQ sauce is too strong for my taste.. Never liked BBQ sauce in the first place.. Artichoke + spinach on thin crust is also good (i guess im a big fan of their artichoke recipe).. I tried both these pizzas in emeryville branch.. I don't think there'll be any difference. All in all, cpk is an above average pizza place.. service and menu is upto par and worth going to if u have extra bucks to spare..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pleasanton?start=260,3.6,3.6,3.6,3.12,3.6000000000000005

Whatever- i've been a waitress for many years and never have been told its a fire hazard for a little high chair to be in the isle.

279,Linyan T.,"Pleasanton, CA",0,1,,4.0,2012-01-24,"I came here with two friends after we wandered around the mall looking for something to eat, and we decided to come to cpk. I'm definitely coming back! The kitchen is this large open space at the back where you can see everything going on-it looks like a live action episode of top chef, which I like because you get to see everything the chefs are doing. I ordered Vegetarian with Japanese eggplant, and my friends ordered the Meat-lovers pizza and the chicken alfredo. All of them were really good. My pizza had these huge gigantic almost tree-size pieces of broccoli, which to some people might be a turn off but I love broccoli and it looked really nice on the pizza. The only bad thing I would say is that I didn't notice the Japanese eggplant; I felt like they needed to embellish the fact it was ""Japanese"" and ""exotic"" to justify the price-$11. The meat-lover's pizza was amaaazing. I feel like its worth more to buy a meatier pizza than the vegetable ones because my pizza was meh compared to my friend's. Our service was amazing! Our server was always friendly, smiling, attentive, and would tell us not to be rushed or things like that. She always checked up on us and asked us if we needed refills, parmesan, etc. That alone would be great service. The best part was when she came by and gave me a pizza, then apologizes because the kitchen accidently made the crust too thin, so she gave me the pizza to much on while I wait for the  . Whoa. That is awesome service. So when it came time to pay the bill I felt incredibly guilty because we only had three twenty dollar bills between us so our tip didn't match what I felt was an amazing service. I'm giving major bonus points to our awesome server and if I get her again the next time I come here I'll make sure to give her a generous tip!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pleasanton?start=320,3.4,3.4,3.4,3.152,3.4000000000000004

Maybe it was just the waiters/waitresses that we got but 3 times the service just wasn't what you would expect from the Emeryville one. They were all either not very responsive or they wouldn't give us the things that you would normally expect without asking such as bread, water refills, etc. The food was up to standard though and the place was pretty clean since it is still new.

If you want your drink a double just tell the server to make the drink a double and it only costs $1 more. The pizzas are good. Pastas are average and take too long. Salads are big.

The sauce was a bit sweet but on the good side. Habanero Carnitas original crust pizza in honey wheat dough is another good one. There was supposed to be a very spicy salsa. But we asked to skip that. The pizza toppings were still a bit spicy but was gent and not biting. The pizza tasted very good but a little greasy.  The thing we liked the most was Jambalaya Fettuccine. It came with shrimp, blackened chicken, crawfish in cajun sauce. It did come a little kick but was super enjoyable. Highly recommend it.

It's topped with scallions, mozzarella, tiny chicken bits (very tiny). Crust had a nice bready flavor and chewiness. I liked it a lot. The chicken was dry and the pieces were, once again, very tiny. Overall flavor profile is extremely rich and savory, with a hint of smokiness. DH tried the creamy vodka fettuccine with red bell peppers. This one had a Southwest vibe. The pasta was thick, green, and texture was slightly off. Tough to describe, but it was sort of like eating day-old pasta. Which isn't bad, but isn't great either. Sauce was okay, though. We had the asparagus and arugula, shaved Parmesan salad, which was neatly plated. Really? At CPK? This was unexpected. It was a very nice blend, especially with the sun dried tomatoes.

378,Kim R.,"Pleasanton, CA",59,67,161.0,4.0,2013-11-26,"I published my first blog post about California Pizza Kitchen's gluten-free items about three years ago when I first started blogging. It was right before they pulled their gluten-free pizza off the menu. CPK decided to start over and reintroduce their GF pizza...""the right way."" While they kept certain GF items on the menu, they put the GF pizza on hold. They then approached the Gluten Intolerance Group of North America for a restaurant certification and made many changes to the process of making gluten-free pizza crust in their restaurants. Here are the important points to understand about CPK's gluten-free menu items including the new GF pizza. Important Points to understand about CPK's GF menu items 1) The Gluten Intolerance Group of North American (GIG) certifies restaurants that use the strict procedures approved by GIG. There are currently four ""GIG certified"" items on the CPK menu. They include the pizzas listed on the small menu above: GF Margherita, GF Chicken Barbecue, GF Mushroom Pepperoni Pizza and GF Pepperoni. 2) To be a ""GIG certified"" GF menu item at CPK, the food must be prepared in the new GF dedicated part of the kitchen and all of the ingredients used on the pizza must be from that dedicated area. For example, I requested goat cheese on my son's pizza since we don't do cow' milk cheese. They could not certify his pizza because the goat cheese comes from another part of the kitchen that is not certified. 3) You can order a different style pizza not listed on the above menu with the GF crust, but it will not be ""GIG certified."" 4) They use a blue sticker as seen below to seal all pizzas that are considered ""certified."" 5) The manager is supposed to deliver any certified GF pizza. It is to be delivered upon completion, even if it's done before the rest of the table's food so that it does not sit around and potentially become contaminated with flour/gluten. The manager is also supposed to wash his/her hands before handling the pizza. 6) There are other menu items listed as ""GF"" on their regular menu. These dishes are not considered ""GIG certified."" They are free of gluten ingredients but are not prepared in the dedicated part of the kitchen. The white corn guacamole and chips listed on the menu below is an example of this. This basically means that the dish is free of gluten ingredients but they cannot guarantee against cross contamination of gluten. I have inquired with CPK as to whether the chips are fried in dedicated oil but have not heard back yet. 7) CPK now uses rice flour to work all their pizza dough including wheat flour dough. This prevents the very small airborne flour molecules from contaminating the dedicated part of the kitchen. 8) I am told that the new CPK pizza dough is potato flour based. This Quinoa and Arugula Salad has been a long time favorite of mine. It has never made me sick. I also like the Roasted Veggie Salad but it has made me sick before. I'm not sure why. I have checked with CPK numerous times and they confirm each time that they use olive oil in their salad dressings. I believe that canola oil, commonly used in restaurants, causes a very similar reaction in my gut as gluten. Overall, I had a positive experience at CPK. I am waiting for answers to the following questions from CPK and will post their response here once I receive it. The answers are now posted below. 1)      Are all your salad dressing free of gluten ingredients? CPK: No, the only dressings that we consider to be Gluten Free are our Dijon Balsamic and Champagne Vinaigrette 2)      Are all your salad dressing made with olive oil and not canola oil? CPK: We use a combination of oils depending on the dressing. 3)      What is the flour blend used for your GF pizza crust? CPK: We use a combination of rice, potato and tapioca flour. 4)      Do you make your own crust or buy it pre-made? CPK: It's our custom recipe made for us at a GF California bakery. 5)      I assume your barbecue sauce is GF. What brand do you use? CPK: We use our own recipe. 6)      I noticed the quinoa and arugula salad is no longer marked GF. I thought it was before. I know it is not certified but is it free of gluten ingredients? If so, why is it no longer marked? CPK: It technically is, but since partnering with GIG, we agreed that we could not put ""GF"" on any menu items unless it was certified by them. We are currently working towards certification. 7)      Are there plans for a GF dessert? CPK: Not at this time. 8)      Do you offer any GF beers or hard cider? Someone told me they offer hard cider. CPK: We do! Our Crispin Honey Crisp Cider is Gluten Free. 9)      Are the chips of the White Corn Guacamole and Chips fried in dedicated oil? CPK: Yes. 10)   Are your GF pizzas baked in a separate oven? CPK: They are not, but they are baked following the strict guidelines set by GIG.

Out waitress was extremely friendly and immediately came to take our order for drinks after we were seated. After we received our drinks, she took our main dish orders and everything ran very smoothly. Last time we weren't given any appetizers for free. However, after we ordered our meals, our waitress came by with complimentary bread and olive oil. You could ask for more free bread if you wanted, which was nice of them. We ordered 4 pizzas, a salad, and a half/half soup. The salad and soup were mediocre, nothing special really. CPK's pizzas are different from the typical pizza company because their crusts/breads are less oily, and you can tell that they made them from scratch. Each pizza is about $12-14 and serves 1-2 people. I think prices are okay, not very cheap and not over the top expensive.  CPK is a pretty decent chain restaurant.

Luckily there were a few spots left at the bar which was open seating, so we swooped in and got to ordering. I had my usual at CPK, the California Club pizza, but this time switched it up and tried the crispy thin crust. My friend had the Thai Chicken pizza. The Cali Club at this location was actually a lot larger than it is when I usually order it, but had a smaller salad topping on top. The crispy thin crust was slightly charred on the edge, but overall the pizza was still pretty filling but I just wish it had more chicken pieces on top. Definitely needed a to-go box after eating half of it. The Thai Chicken pizza was also a good choice, and came topped with shredded carrots, bean sprouts, and green onions. And don't forget the drinks! The appleberry sangria was delicious and fruity with pieces of peaches and blueberries mixed in. Unfortunately the mango mango mojito this time was a bit watered down and tasted more like just Sprite instead of mango. Lastly, since the CPK app wasn't letting us get the free small plate of white corn guacamole, the waitress was kind enough to give us dessert on the house. We shared the new dessert option on the menu which was the salted caramel pudding with an oreo crust. The pudding itself was alright, but they topped it with way too much sea salt.

Around there) I'm a huge fan of Tomatina's spaghettini so I decided to try CPK's. I got the fresh spinach and asparagus spaghettini with the checca sauce.  For those of you who don't know, checca sauce is an uncooked tomato sauce used with pasta. I didn't know that so I did google it before I ordered. Google images sure made it look delicious! I was feeling hungry so I ordered grilled chicken (extra $4) with it as well.  When the food got here, it was a pretty good portion. Unfortunately the pasta was very dry. Pretty much it was just bits of spinach, tomato and small pieces of asparagus tossed together on top of the pasta. No real sauce, everything was tossed together with olive oil (I'm pretty sure) and maybe some herbs. Is that how checca sauce is?! I was disappointed cause I like my spaghettini with a sauce. The grilled chicken was alright.  Wasn't worth $4 though. I ate everything since this dish was $16 -___-  TIP: if you get any of their pastas and you're a sauce lover like me, let them know you want extra sauce!

Tossed with house made Champagne vinaigrette. They are very comfortable with any adjustments to additions or removing items (I don't like the eggs or avocado) and have never given me any troubles with my requests. Even a different dressing(I like the balsamic vinaigrette)  I came in for an early dinner last night and had the place to myself. The service was top notch. I took a drink of water and had it getting refilled almost before I put my glass down.  My friend had their egg roles and I have to admit they looked wonderful.  Don't be fooled with their name.

The pizza was topped with cilantro, BBQ sauce, chicken and red onions. If I knew it was going to be that good I would've ordered one more. The pizza itself was nice and crispy.

We piled into her car and drove out to the Pleasanton area.  The mall was pretty crowded but we found great parking and all went inside.  The hostess ""kind of"" greeted us, it was odd (mind you this is the only reason this location looses any stars) and asked if we needed seating.  Yep... We were seated at a comfortable table where my walking accoutrements (I recently had foot surgery) were out of the way of both patrons and employees.  As Ilana and I were discussing how weird the hostess made us feel our server, Izzy, greeted us with a warm smile and a friendly attitude--wow...we just forgot the rude hostess! Izzy offered us drinks and menu suggestions while leaving us with bread and olive oil to start.  We went with his recommendation of Avocado Egg Rolls and also added the White Corn Guacamole.  Both items came out in a timely fashion, hot and were tasty. Ilana's son was really hungry, bordering on ""hangry"" (you know--hungry mixed with angry) so she ordered him a tiny pepperoni pizza and some apple juice to calm his tiny tummy. I ordered the thin crust artichoke and spinach pizza, and had NO IDEA how BIG it was.  What will I do with all the left overs?  Ilana ordered the Chicken Milense with panko crust, arugula and thick Parmesan shavings.  Hers looked better than mine ;( but mine tasted superb.  The three of us shared everything as we chopped it up and enjoyed each other's company. The manager, Tony, came and checked on us as he was walking throughout the establishment talking with guests and helping his staff.  He chatted with us for several minutes about the business, service, the mall, etc.  We really enjoyed Tony's managerial style and genuine concern for the guests.  Tony made us feel welcome and appreciated.   Between Izzy's excellent service and Tony's sincere and respectful managing, we almost forgot about the ""cold"" hostess at the entrance.  I will say, she is the only reason I deducted a star, too bad for CPK.  The hostess should be the friendliest employee in the restaurant, I think.

Too eventful for my first time going to California Pizza Kitchen.  1 star for the way under performance service! Food was good. The server gave me a bottle of hot sauce and upon using it, the bottom of the bottle broke. The whole bottle of hot sauce was on my pants, all over my coat, cover my thighs and it was a mess. And it burned! The bottle suddenly broke so I wouldn't blame them for it. But it was at THEIR WRONG because they handed us an unsafe (later broken) supply and it happened within their restaurant, within their overseeing and control! Then came the servers tried to say sorry and clean up that mess. They were confused and seemed like don't know what to do. Then came the manager. She asked for my number and said that I could bring the dry clean receipt back, it would be reimbursed. She didn't even ask if I was ok; didn't even think about taking initiative to learn if there was anything they can assist to make me feel better and to correct this situation. All she did was to show us she was sorry, and she clearly showed that her ""would be reimbursement"" on my dry clean was enough or might be too big of a compensate for the big hot mess on my dining out. We were really upset and were ready to leave the place, but managed to chill the night for we knew things happened. And we thought the restaurant would know what to do better in SATISFYING their customers. While we are busy cleaning up on our part, the food went cold. There's no offer to re-do our dinner or even to warm the plates up for us. And we didn't see any server come again to our table until we were ready to pay. It was a Wednesday night, and it was not busy! Then came the check and the manager again, saying sorry again and still no REALISTIC ACTIONS on their part. Then my friend asked her was that it for correcting their incident in their place? She said let her think about it and came back with a so big ""$15 gift card"". How bad I wanted to show her how to be a real deal manger! I write this complaint for I want to tell California Pizza Kitchen at Stoneridge Mall that there will be many times unexpected things like last night happened; and no matter what, you should stay true to your plead to SATISFY your customer, not trying to get away by quick fix and low expectation that you will only do what you think is an enough compensation on your part. To the manager, your way of taking care of these things should be more professional and more caring on your part. Don't just say sorry and do nothing. You could be a better manager when you ACT your APOLOGY realistically. The restaurant can thrive if you lead your team giving an extraordinary service and experience to customers than what you gave last night. I paid $58.42 to get 2 cold pizzas, a throw away pants & shirt with hot sauce spill, a stink coat, wet shoes, dirty purse and and burned thighs! Your really bad service and $15 gift card would never come close to meet anyone's acceptance, don't even think about satisfaction.

Went here on a Friday, around lunchtime so they were lightweight slammed. But for a party of 7, they seated us within 10 mins, which isn't bad. They have a different place in the back corner of the restaurant near the kitchen where you pick up online/called in orders, FYI. It doesn't look that big from the outside but inside could easily seat a good amount of people. Pretty much all the tables were filled. The kitchen is open so you can see the chefs making your food, & they actually have seating right there. It has the best seat for watching sports since the TV is right there. Our waitress was friendly but took a while to get our order & then our order took almost 30-35 mins to arrive. For people on a lunchtime crunch, we were a little impatient. (She asked what we were there for & we told her it was a work lunch for a co-workers birthday, so she knew it was lunchtime for us) I ordered the Pesto Cream Penne, which is a freshly made basil pesto cream sauce with sun dried tomatoes and parmesan. Let me tell you, they are not sheisty on the sauce. They drench that bad boy, lol. I am just sayin'. Nothing is worse than dry noodles, right?! There were some sauce leftover & I had a good amount of noodles drowning in it. I am a fan! :) The pasta was yummers!!! The sun-dried tomatoes were on point with this dish, the perfect combination.

He made sure we were ok and if we needed anything he'd get it. I gave the four stars because the hostess didn't smile as we were waiting for someone to come take our reservation. She also didn't look me in the eye while asking how many I had in my party. When she sat us, I felt like she was rushing to get us seated. Not caring at all. She just said Paul will be our server while looking at the wall with no smile and then walked away. Even though she was very rude, I still said thank you twice and no response from this girl.

70,Cassy Y.,"South San Francisco, CA",249,52,25.0,4.0,2016-01-02,"I have never tried CPK pizza but after trying it for the first time, I definitely do like it more than some other pizza places mainly because it was overall less greasy (or didn't left you with a greasy feeling) and everything tasted extremely fresh.  As a party of 2, we went to CPK on a Tuesday a little bit before noon and before the lunch rush  hour. There weren't a lot of people there (maybe about 5 tables seated) but was greeted with big smiles from the managing partner and the host who sat us down at a booth. The waitress overall throughout our whole meal was very kind in offering advice, if we needed water or anything more, bringing us bread to start, and also was smart enough to give me smaller bills for change so that I was able to tip her a fair amount. We ordered the ""two in a bowl"" soup, spicy chipotle chicken pizza, and California club pizza.  The two in a bowl soup consisted of half tortilla soup and half pea and barley soup. Both soups were too thick of a consistency for me and I felt like it could almost pass as a dip instead of a coup. The tortilla soup I enjoyed more than the pea and barley. The pea and barley soup just tasted odd, gritty, and a little bitter. I won't be ordering the soup again.  The two pizzas, on the bright side, were both delicious! The spicy chipotle chicken definitely was spicy but the side cilantro based sauce helped a little with the heat and added more flavor to the overall pizza. I was impressed by the flavors. The california club pizza was a little bit odd but I liked the overall concept and taste of it. It seemed like they were trying to turn a salad into a pizza which they did very well. My only gripe is that the bacon the part that threw off the whole pizza in that I tasted almost only bacon when eating the pizza.

Told the server, Will, I was a veteran, and he kept telling me how any pizza I asked about was not free. I made it clear I knew which pizzas were free since I was holding the menu and was pointing each and every time at the other menu when asking about a pizza (not the special Veteran's Day one). Asked Will if he could tell me what was on the special, the Korean BBQ. He said it just be like the Thai Pizza with a peanut sauce, as they are both Asian pizzas. Yeah, makes sense... He screws up the order and almost gets us 3 pizzas after I clearly told him I didn't want the Korean BBQ because he no clue what was on it. Later on in the evening, he forgets to bring us soup. Then Will says the real kicker line: ""We got Dragon Ball Z going on here or what?"" Because there is no one around us that he could be referring to since he's  looking straight at us. And there aren't any Asian families nearby. Just us. No Dragon Ball Z t-shirts, toys, nothing. Will has completely lost his mind. And then he follows immediately with, ""What's your daughter's name?"" Very fake and creepy. When we ask to replace the broccilini, falsely advertised as ""baby broccoli"" (really???), another server throws a hissy fit and yells at us: ""That's how the dish always comes, so next time, ask for the macaroni."" Seriously? So I speak to the  manager, and kudos to M.J. She is the only sane and professional one there apparently. She immediately apologized and offered to get us a new pizza (Will forgot the bacon I told him to add to it twice.), and then took responsibility for her poor training of the employees.

I could have parked mine in front of those 2 blocking them in, but I see a spot by the front door next to fire extinguisher.  Because the stroller would be blocking the fire extinguisher and it was right by the front door, I asked hostess Mariah if it was OK to leave my stroller there. She answers me with a quick yes then looks back at the other hostess and started talking. I stand there and wait, wanted to make sure she knows its right next to a  fire extinguisher. She answers again quickly then goes back talking to the other hostess. Geez. I was irritated. That was horrible customer service.

As soon as we got through the doors we received some of the best-restaurant service I have ever received. We got seated relatively quickly, actually we were seated a lot faster than we were anticipating considering that this was a Saturday evening at dinnertime. First of all I need to shout out the manager on duty Debbie; she was AMAZING. She constantly came by out table to check on us to see if we were getting everything ok and made pleasant small-talk with us. She made our first experience personal and not many restaurants provide that kind of service. Second our waitress was also top-notch. She was fast, took great care of us, and was definitely on top of her game! Third the food was AMAZING. I am usually not a fan of thin-crust pizza but I ordered the Sicilian and it was one of the best pizza's that I ever had! We all ordered different pizzas and sampled each others and none of us left disappointed.

The food was great and I was very pleased with toppings on my veggie pizza. It had a mix of broccoli and mushrooms that was perfectly blended together. I was able to combine it with a Caesar salad and add a cup of pea soup. Overall great combination and best of all I ate a guilt free meal.

77,Jade M.,"Fremont, CA",72,387,174.0,4.0,2016-07-19,"The food is overpriced but you get better quality and really excellent tasting food. I got the soy ginger glazed steamed chicken dumplings. I was pretty amazed what I  ate, and it was overpriced. So food is 5 but prices were $$$. I was going for the rib eye but it had only  serving with arugula salad and some roasted fingerling potatoes for almost $30. I got some butter cake for dessert with whipped cream. It's like a Gooey Butter Cake but had some brown sugar streusel inside the cake. Kristen,the server asked if I wanted ice cream with it. But I chose to have it with whipped cream. The butter cake tasted like it had a lot of butter with brown sugar streusel inside of it and had a flan like custard burnt on top of it. I guess this is their propriety desserts they serve on their menu. This is really good butter cake which is good for 1 person and it was perhaps 4.5 inches in diameter and great for 1 person or 2 people. It was like a light, custardy rich cake. You should always get the pastas, flatbread and their gourmet pizzas, salads and appetizers are awesome here. Either get the butter cake, salted caramel pudding or the key lime pie. Their food is great but I thought the prices were kind of overpriced. Average price is $9 to $30. I can understand why they serve $30 for the primed rib eye with blue cheese butter, roasted fingerling potatoes and a side of arugula salad for $30. This item is the only beef dinner item on the menu because they signature items are the gourmet style pizzas and pasta dishes. Today's food experience was phenomenal because I just ordered the soy ginger glazed chicken dumplings that are steamed and had a mix of soy ginger glazed sauce, green scallions, and toasted sesame seeds on top. The dumplings were wrapped with made from scratch wonton wrappers and ground chicken were perfectly seasoned and cooked. I said, this was presented very well and the taste was phenomenal and cost around $8. I had the butter cake for dessert. I forgot to take pictures because I was so hungry, and kept on eating it until it was gone. I thought my food experience here was amazing like 4.5/5. This waiting time for this restaurant on a late weekday afternoon is less than 5 minutes, and you were seated promptly and the hostess was really courteous and pleasant. You felt welcome and comfortable when you are asked where do you want to sit. The server, Kristen was very pleasant and was approachable when she had no problem about any requests or if you had any questions about the menu. They want to make sure you are treated well and no bias or favorites. That's an A grade for customer service. I have seen an older guy who has been trained being a GM, and expediter in the restaurant. The prices seemed overpriced because average range is $8 to $25. But these menu items are made from scratch and made with fresh ingredients. Perhaps better than P.F. Chang's and The Cheesecake Factory. P.F.Chang's - the ambiance was very trendy and modern, but the customer service was absent and subdued. Servers and the hostess seemed disinterested in their work. The food was very bland, and the options were not very creative. So I really don't like it all. Overhyped - yes. The Cheesecake Factory - the menu has too many options that cater a Skinnylicious option or regular option. Desserts are best here - different flavors of cheese cakes, dessert cakes and some signature desserts, cocktails are great here too. I would say their servers are kind of plenty but food experience can be confusing. So the food here is sometimes comforting, but not really flavorful as in the California Pizza Kitchen. So the food here is 3.5/5. This is really great- if there was a happy hour in the late afternoon with some drinks. Then go there. They have a tv which is perfect especially if its on ESPN. California Pizza Kitchen - the food experience is phenomenal and just read my review mentioned above. So next time, if you want something different like a pizza, pasta or maybe wanted to try their desserts. Go here and you won't be disappointed.  I noticed the ambiance is very subtle but the seating here is very spacious. So it is inviting and makes you comfortable to dine here. I enjoyed my time here, and will probably come here soon. Service is a 5. Cleanliness and ambiance is 5. So overall, it is 4/5.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pleasanton?start=100,3.48,3.32,3.292,3.184,3.3840000000000003

She asked us if we had been there before and I told her it had been awhile. Melissa then asked if we wanted some beverages so we could read through the menu. Melissa brought them right away and then started to let us know what was new on the menu. Then she gave us a few moments to decide and then in the meantime she brought out our nice and hot fresh bread with olive oil. Then Melissa took our order my son ordered the personal pizza barbecue and chicken and I ordered fettuccine with shrimp and chicken. Let me tell you the food was so amazing.  Then Melissa was always there filling our raspberry ice tea and checking up on us making sure we were ok. Then before you knew it our food was served. Then Melissa continued to always tend to our needs along with making sure her other guests were taken care of at the same time and with a smile on her face. Melissa then brought me a Togo box and a dessert menu and we ordered the salted Carmel pudding.  OMG it was more amazing than I could ever hoped for.  Melissa then gave me our check and I thanked her for being the BEST SERVER AND MAKING OUR DINNER EXPERIENCE EVEN MORE SPECIAL. I told her that not everyday we have a server that is exceptional and she was definitely exceptional tonight serving us. My son and I gave her a 20% tip that was well deserved. She had told me in the beginning about the survey and my son and I were more than happy to do the survey and brag to management of how exceptional Melissa was as our server.  Debra the manager didn't come to our table however I did mention to her on our way out how exceptional Melissa was as our server and how happy we were to do the survey and fill out the rewards card and I hope she wins the contest b/c she definitely deserves to win.

But there we were, my daughter and I, with a couple dozen other 7-year olds and adult chaperones, jammed into a giant freezer in the back of a CPK, being shown around by the manager - a friendly man with a Texas drawl.  Minutes earlier, we'd arrived late for a birthday party, and I was wondering what we'd be doing in a pizza restaurant at 9 am on a Saturday. But to my pleasant surprise, it was a pizza making party! Yayyyy!  The kids first got a tour of the restaurant and kitchen. The manager showed them how the ordering system works, introduced them to the workers making Hawaiian pizzas (they use eight fresh pineapples daily), and quizzed them on how many total pizzas they sell (500, give or take). The kids got to see how dough is flattened, veggies cleaned, dishes washed, and food stored in the ginormous pantry and the aforementioned freezer.  Then it was on to the birthday table area to ""handcraft"" their individual pizzas. Each kid got a rolled out pie with fixings on the side - tomato sauce, cheese, ham, pepperoni, olives, mushrooms and so on. Their pizzas were numbered before baking so they had to eat what they made (never too early for that lesson in life!).  While the kids were busy, the adults were served pizza and beverages (I sure needed that coffee!). I spent time getting to know some of the other parents... with the kids being in a contained space there was no need to keep a constant eye on them!  Before I knew it, it was time for birthday cake, goodie bags, and to-go containers for leftovers. The staff were on their game and every thing was orderly and efficient.

Luckily for these establishments, I'm the complete opposite and have come to love that I can rely on the consistency of these cookie cutter eateries. This is not an insult- if anything, it's a compliment. I love cookies and the cutters make them into cute shapes.  On to my actual review! I've been to a few CPKs before. But this had to be the most upscale lounge location. Then again, I haven't been to one in so long- so that's probably also the reasoning behind my (pleasant) surprise. There are many dining options at Stoneridge mall. What I love about this place is that it's the perfect middle to the higher end Cheesecake Factory and the ever so approachable McDonald's or subway.  My go-to here is always the Cobb salad. You can't go wrong with it. Luckily for me, I was having lunch with one of my favorite people. We both love to order from every section of the menu, as realistically as possible. Especially when everything looks and sounds so delicious.  Even though we ordered two appetizers and an entree salad to share, everything came out at the same time. We were so lucky because it was a Sunday afternoon, at noon. There was no wait and we were immediately seated in a booth.  When the food came, we didn't hesitate to dig in. The spicy buffalo cauliflower had just the right amount of tang, crunch, and creaminess. The sauce can build up in spicy hotness since they use Sriracha in it. So maybe the children should steer clear of this one. The thing I loved most about this plate was the surprisingly garlicky kick. I can't get enough garlic, so we ended up dipping the (complimentary) bread in it too.  The shaved mushroom and spinach flatbread satiated our hungry stomachs. It was so fragrant, but mot overpowering. The mushrooms weren't watery and so they gave a nice, thin meaty texture to complement the crispy bread base.  Lastly, the reliable old California Cobb salad. We got a full entree portion. Everything was eaten family style, so we were stuffed. We didn't opt for dessert because we wanted to stop by Quickly for some boba a bit later on. Which we did.  This is a really great alternative for when Cheesecake Factory is completely crowded. And even when it's crowded at CPK, you can call and order to go. Win, win.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pleasanton,3.68,3.58,3.344,,3.6200000000000006

Our turn next.  Wrong!  The host sat both the party of six and the party of ten that came after us.  OK, I get that.  You can't pass up business like that.  But, then the host sat  two different parties of two that came AFTER us.   No excuse for that right?  Except that both parties were women and the host enjoyed flirting with them.  I pointed out that we had been passed over twice for parties of our same size and even showed him our name on his list.  No apology.  No admission of a mistake.  Tried to tell me something about them waiting for an outside table and coming in.  But I was sitting right there for the last 25 minutes.  I watched both groups walk in from the mall and put their names in after me.  The host completely lied.  He just chose to seat them first.  I won't be back.  Racist-sexist-BS.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pleasanton?start=60,3.48,3.51,3.328,,3.498

26,Busayo O.,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",58,55,52.0,5.0,2017-12-22,"I have been to this CPK several times before. I always have a great experience here and at CPKs in general. I like how warm and welcoming the staff are. Lately I have been eating at the bar because service is faster and it's nice sitting in the high chairs. The bartender who served me was very kind. This CPK is very clean, organized and they staff is very friendly and works hard to make sure you have an excellent experience. It has a nice, relaxed ambience and I love sitting at the bar with the open kitchen. It's really fun to see how the pizza is made! :) I decided to order the lunch special (11am-4pm) which starts at $8.95. I went with the smashed meatball dish with the Sedona tortilla soup which was only $10.95 I believe. It was so delicious and it is like a lighter calzone that is very filling with the Sedona tortilla soup which was scrumptious! She even offered me some bread and their bread and olive oil dip is always so good!! Molto bene!! Lol. :) Overall, it was really good! I also had their water which is Acqua Panna in the 1/2 liter ($3.79). Acqua Panna is so crisp and refreshing and they serve it in a wine glass with lime. This is my favorite place to go and unwind. I love CPK. I should probably get their rewards card, lol since I love going here. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pleasanton,3.44,3.51,3.332,,3.482
23,Denise M.,"Longwood - Winton Grove, Hayward, CA",135,84,205.0,3.0,2017-12-29,"CPK is usually pretty busy as It is located right outside of stoneridge mall, so right after or before a trip to the mall many people come here to eat. They are known for their pizza's and It is great, however the food here does take a while since It is a pretty big place. When I came last time, my food was cold and It was hard to get my waiters attention since she was managing so many tables at once. It is an average place but It is fairly pricy for dinner as my spaghetti bolognese was somewhere around $14-$18.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pleasanton,3.36,3.5,3.332,,3.4440000000000004
20,Karen L.,"San Leandro, CA",175,178,1142.0,4.0,2018-01-03,"Haven't been to CPK in a while. There's always a crowd. Came here with the bf on a Friday night after doing a little shopping. We went to sit at the bar because we didn't want to wait for a table. Luis was serving that area (about 10-12 stools maybe) and asked us if we wanted anything to drink. I got a Fresh Strawberry Mango Cooler while the bf ordered a Blue Moon. He brought us bread with olive oil about 15 mins later. So, we ordered a classic dish ""Roasted Garlic Chicken Pizza"" and also tried something new, ""Chile-Braised Short Ribs + Chipotle Mac n' Cheese."" The pizza was good; simple ingredients but flavorful due to the garlic & scallions if ya like that. The short ribs mac n' cheese was alright for me. Tasted kind of smoky. You'd probably like it if you like smoked dishes lol. Anyway, I'd also recommend the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine, Sicilian Pizza, Spinach Artichoke Dip or BBQ Chicken Pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-pleasanton,3.4,3.53,3.336,,3.478
