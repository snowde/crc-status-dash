72,Robert K.,"Philadelphia, PA",98,38,16.0,1.0,2012-01-23,"Based On the recent reviews, I decided to try CPK when the wait at Redstone was too long.  It appeared, again based on the recent reviews, that the restaurant had turned the corner. Boy was I wrong.  In fact, the experience was bad enough that I'm still sitting here waiting for the check and felt compelled to write this.  The restaurant was about half full with plenty of staff standing around talking so one would think that we would be at least somewhat well taken care of. This was not the case at all. We had to wait 20 minutes to have our drink order taken. Our appetizer (fried Mac and cheese) came out cold and the main entrees (pizzas, a BLT and a salad in stages). When we finished our entrees, our waitress came back (mind you she never check on our meal after she brought it) and stated,""you don't want desert do you?"". Really?  My party had eaten our entire meal and to make a decision for us wasn't really very appropriate. We did order desert which ended up being the worst mistake. After taking our order, she left and disappeared for 20 minutes (not an exaggeration) for her to come back and notify us that two of the four items were no longer available. Ok, I get that but it took her 20 minutes to figure that out?  The two that came out shortly thereafter were melted (ice cream based) and one was entirely wrong. We had to actually get up and find our waitress after waiting another 10 minutes to get her to fix the mess up. We're still here 20 minutes later waiting for the check. we were just notified we are waiting to get ""comped"" for the butter cake we couldn't get because they were out. Unbelievable!  No ""I'm sorry"" or ""I apologize for the wait"". Nothing. ARGH! The only reason this review gets 1 star is that the food was fair (certainly nothing to return for regardless of the service). Overall this experience ranks among the worst I've ever experienced.  For the first and only time in my entire life I'm leaving without leaving a tip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plymouth-meeting?start=60,2.8520000000000003,2.8520000000000003,2.8520000000000003,2.8520000000000003,2.8520000000000008

I'm glad I stopped in as we had a very pleasant experience. I decided not to go for a pizza this time and try something new, so I ordered the grilled chicken chimichurri with grilled veggies. The dish was tasty but that chimichurri sauce definitely had a kick to it, which did wonders for my sinuses! Unfortunately, my mouth was on fire a bit and my waiter didn't refill my water fast enough to my liking. Anytime a customer orders a spicy dish, they should be more on top of the refills. Other than that though, no major complains and my son and I enjoyed our meals.

First of all, some must-eat appetizers are the lettuce wraps and/or spring rolls, which come in three flavors that are all equally delicious! Secondly, their name is ""pizza kitchen"" so yes, their pizza is pretty good. I wouldn't say it's anything super unique or crazy good because I know some other smaller (non-chain) pizza places do what CPK does and make ""gourmet"" pizzas, but they are pretty decent and worth it because the prices are decent! Another favorite of mine is their flavored iced teas. Nothing special because I think they just pump syrup into fresh iced tea, but it tastes so good!! (Sometimes they make it too sweet, but just add some water to suit your taste.)

I have been to this location before for both lunch and dinner, and have had much better previous meals here. The waitress we had did not speak loudly at all, so I had to strain to hear her, and the restaurant wasn't that crowded or loud at all. She took our order, then went to go get our drinks. Our appetizers came, and she was nowhere to be found to ask how they were. I ordered the Baked Mac N Cheese, which I love, so I would've been more than happy to tell her how good it was. Our entrees came, and again the waitress was nowhere to be found. Once to come and ask if everything came out ok, and then another time to ask how everything was - both times, no one came. The other pet peeve I have is the empty dishes and glasses left on the table. We still had both of our appetizer dishes and empty glasses from our first round of iced tea.

We decided to start with the Crispy Mac 'N' Cheese, Half Caesar Salad, and the Bianco Flatbread.  I enjoyed the flatbread but the rest was okay.  The salad didn't seem very fresh and the crispy mac 'n' cheese was good but nothing to get excited about.  For our entrees, I had the Fish Tacos w/ Avocado and my girlfriend had the Garlic Cream Fettuccine w/ Sauteed Mushrooms & Chicken.  The chicken in the pasta wasn't good, the mushrooms were good, but the sauce was blandish and not as garlic flavored as expected from the description.  As for my fish tacos, I enjoyed the tacos but they were nothing special.

I visited on a weekend with my husband after coming from the movies. My only issue was that I couldn't decide between the Hawaiian BBQ Chicken and The California Club pizza. I literally took 10 minutes just trying to decide between the two. I asked my server if she had to choose between the two, which one would she choose. So she says ""why choose? Get them both."" She then explained that I could get 1/2 of each on one pizza. That made my entire night!!! Both pizza flavors were so delicious that I may never order a different item at CPK ever again.

32,Mike M.,"Blue Bell, PA",86,181,51.0,4.0,2015-07-25,"For those who aren't familiar with CPK in general, they offer a menu of inventive ""pizzas"" (many with atypical toppings and sauces besides tomato), salads, tacos, etc.  The food is fresh and the recipes are somewhat creative, which makes it pretty good as this type of chain goes.  I'm not the biggest fan of their more traditional pizza items (the kinds that come with actual tomato sauce), but I like the Thai Chicken Pizza and the Hawaiian BBQ Chicken Pizza (to which I usually add bacon).  The salads are good, if that's your thing.  And, the pork tacos and fish tacos are both better than I would have expected.  Their bar is also above average... There aren't many people sitting there just to drink, but they have a good selection, make drinks well, and have some decent TVs around the area. The Plymouth Meeting location is a pretty nice one.  It's pleasant inside, they keep it nice and clean, and they have a patio with outdoor seating.  The service is excellent.  They're very nice from you're first interaction with a host or hostess through the moment that you walk out the door, and the servers are consistently capable.  Their weak spot is their take out.  They have a pretty convenient take out system, with a dedicated counter that's close to reserved parking spots.  They get take-out orders wrong more often than is really reasonable, though.  To their credit, their managers are models of how to appropriately take care of customers after mistakes, but it shouldn't have to come to that. If you're dining in, this CPK is a pretty safe bet.  For take-out, I would recommend checking your order before you leave. P.S., if you're planning on crossing the parking lot to the movie theater, ask them about their offer for movie tickets.  You can buy vouchers there to save a few dollars on your ticket.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plymouth-meeting?start=20,3.44,3.44,3.44,3.472,3.4400000000000004

The tv with sports on is a plus in my book. Ordered the Mac and Cheese bites for $3.99 (they were cold by the time I got them) and a Caribbean sunset sangria $8.59 which is delicious. I wanted to order a pizza but I was in the restaurant over 40 min and my main entree was yet to be put in. The manager did apologize and asked if I wanted anything. She was busting her a** to be the helping hand in the kitchen and bar but I didn't want to wait an additional 20-30 min for food. So I decided to just get the check and leave.

Some of my favorites here are: the pea and barley soup (it's vegan, which is a bonus for me!), the white corn guacamole, the macaroni and cheese balls, the flat breads, and the spinach & artichoke dip.

Then I asked for a refill. Big mistake. I had to ask twice, again. Then, he brought me a raspberry iced tea. Not a lemonade. I asked again. Finally, I was given my raspberry lemonade. It was a struggle. We had a total of 10 glasses on the table at one time, not including a heap of other dirty dishes. We weren't asked if we needed anything else throughout the meal. My pizza was also brought to me wrong but they fixed it quickly. They didn't really make it feel like it wasn't a problem though. Ultimately it was an amusing dinner. Food was alright.

I'll keep this one quick, as most people are familiar with California Pizza Kitchen. When I think pizza, I think New York or Chicago...not California. As such, the pizza here is just okay, but there is a great lunch combo - Lunch Size Pizza + Soup or Salad/Half Sandwich + Soup or Salad/Soup + Salad for around $10-11. I opted for the Original BBQ Chicken Pizza and the Super Spinach + Quinoa with Granny Smith apples, marinated cranberries and spiced pecans with our housemade vinaigrette. The salad was the best part - the pizza was a little burnt with overcooked ingredients.  Overall, it's an average lunch spot that's a little overpriced other than the lunch special.

The menu offers a lot of different options from Salads to Pizza to Main Entrees. I've tried almost every appetizer at this point and cannot complain about any of them. Portion sizes are large and items are tasty. Last night I also had the Angel Hair Pasta with Spinach and Asparagus. It was truly delicious. The sauce was light but tasty and the portion left enough for me to have for lunch today. Our server Abby was great. She was very attentive and on point.

We were way past our kids dinner time so we quickly ordered food for our 4 year old in addition to our drinks. Our waiter was super fast getting us our drinks and overall he took great care of us the entire visit. Our dinners included the wild mushroom strozzapretti, the BBQ chicken pizza, and a salad for my mom. My 4year old decided on Mac n cheese.  Our waiter brought us the bread which came with olive oil and some herbs, could have used some more there but it was a nice start. After a little wait our waiter told us the kids meal was coming soon but our entrees came out first. We still waited for the kids meal that we ordered more than 10 minutes before the adult entrees. This was the only issue with out dinner, thankfully our 4 year old wasn't feisty but, kids meals gotta come out first!!!  The strozzapretti was delicious but a little small on the portion. The image in the menu looked substantial but the final portion was kinda weak. The BBQ chicken pizza with pineapple (suggested by our waiter) was awesome and my wife loved it. Great pizza dough here! My mom loved her salad but who cares. It's salad.  Not a bad spot to dine if you're in the mall area.

Obviously the original BBQ Chicken Pizza is a classic, but their entrees are good and worth paying a little more than a pizza. Fish, pasta, and salads are all worth trying. I've gotten catering here for work, and the driver showed up on time, set stuff up, and brought stuff I'd forgotten I'd need. Everything was hot even though my building is in Conshocken. You should get in the free Pizza Dough club for cash back. Definitely worth it. Since the kitchen is open, you know they're doing things correctly.

My dad and I shared the white mushroom (I added chicken) and the roasted garlic chicken with carmelized onions. Those onions though. Hit. Them. Up. The crust is crispy and chewy without being too thin, and they were perfect size pies in my opinion (as in plenty to take home). We also tried out the hummus app with pita. The hummus had a very distinct taste to it which I could go either way with, but the pita needed work.  I also got fancy with the arugula, avocado, sundried tomato salad. I eat those things out of the jar, so yeah, it was delightful.  As far as the atmosphere I absolutely love the open circular concept.

Our appetizers included their bianca bread which was covered with parmesan cheese and sage.  Delicious.  We also enjoyed their hummus which came with...you guessed it...more bread in the form of flatbread wedges.  Excellent hummus and as good as anyone else's, probably better. Dinner was...bread, but covered with mozzarella cheese, prosciutto, sauce, and sausage.  Yeah some call this pizza, but in light of the gluten overload let's just stick with bread covered with stuff.  Really, if you enjoy thin crust pizza this is good.

Food: we love the food here and the food can be customized to vegetarian friendly diets. For appraisers, you cannot go wrong with the Thai Crunch Salad (avocado substitute for chicken). Entree: tostada pizza & Thai chicken pizza (no chicken) Service: service is always attentive at this and KOP location. Ambience: the seating and lighting in comfortable",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plymouth-meeting,3.48,3.48,3.48,,3.4800000000000004
2,Emily C.,"Lansdale, PA",29,62,62.0,1.0,2017-11-19,"Absolutely worst service ever. Waited forever to get even water. And another long long wait. We did not have designated server. We had to grab random server to order. Food came out cold/undercooked.. recooked pasta for us but no compensation for that. Which we didnt even expect them to compensate. totally unhappy, disappointed, frustrated about this service and food..  My partner and i went in for dinner on sunday evening. We waited approx 25min to be seated. And when we sat, we did not get served and had to wait for another 15 mins. We eventually grabbed random server and asked for water. The host brought us bread without water, napkin, and utensils. Later, we asked another server to bring us water and utensils. And the other server came and received the order like she was doing our favor. We ordered pizza and garlic cream pasta. Pasta was served cold, undercook, totally not appealing. We had to bring up that matter to the server. Brought us warmed pasta. No water refil, no extra napkins, nobody came to check on us after that. It was such an unpleasant dining experience  we went in there with good mood for sunday dinner , but came out lousy mood... will NEVER return here EVER!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plymouth-meeting,3.36,3.36,3.36,,3.3600000000000003
1,Brian C.,"Quakertown, PA",9,4,,2.0,2017-11-19,"If you want a brief summary, scroll to the bottom. So... waited ~25 mins to be seated (party of 2) Interestingly, we saw maybe 4 or 5 tables that were empty. We were not sure why we had to wait that long when tables were available but that is fine. After being seated, we were ready to order since we decided on what to get while we were waiting. Guess how long we waited to get water and bread? another 20 minutes. Funny part is WE had to call a server and ask to get us some water and ordered food because I felt like we were going to wait for amother 20 mins if we didnt call someone. she ""kindly"" told us that she will take care of us as if she is doing us a favor... Interesting... but anyways, so we ordered our food, then the host comes to us about 5 minutes later asking if somebody came by... so we told him we had to call someone but we did order... about another 5 mins later, host comes out with bread and plates... still no drinks, no napkins or no utensils...  Food did come out. we ordered Spicy chipotle pizza (I think that was the name) and garlic fetuccine with shrimp. We thought... well food is here so let us just enjoy the food and get on the way. Unfortunately, fetuccine is cold... and the person who took our order...(dont know her name because she never told us) was no where to be found. another server came by asking if we need anything so we told her about the fettucine. she took the food back and brought it out later warm. the server (the first one) stopped by once and we told her about the fettucine but after that she did not stop by to see if we were doing okay or whatever until we were clearly done.  Pizza was fine, pasta was okay... but the service made me not want to stay and finish the food. i dont know whether somebody got sick in middle of a shift but it was a ridiculous visit. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- visited on sunday evening time to be seated: 25 mins time waited for bread: 45 mins time waited for water and utensil: 50 mins will I ever come back? Maybe at another location but not this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plymouth-meeting,3.32,3.32,3.32,,3.3200000000000003
19,Lilly C.,"Malvern, PA",0,3,,1.0,2017-12-16,"First it wasn't crowded but my granddaughter and I were seated at a dirty table the host apologized and sent someone over to clean it. We had to ask for a child's menu. We ordered and bread was brought to the table but no bread plates. Our entrees arrived but we had no silverware. When asked ""Can I get you anything else?"" I responded ""forks would be nice"". She brought over just 2 forks wrapped in one napkin. I guess we have to share and forget about cutting your food. This location is not for us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plymouth-meeting,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006
13,Tara B.,"Garnet Valley, PA",42,1,,1.0,2018-01-02,"I had gone in ahead to make sure there was seating available, since it was NYE, and though the hostess was not at the desk, I could clearly see several open booths and tables. After waiting a few moments with two other families I went out to get my companion who is in wheelchair.  We thought getting him in the narrow door that should've been the accessible option would be the hard part. He barely fit through, and the molding that went from cement outside to floor inside had a substantial lip. We pushed on with the help of strangers and got him in. That door is NOT ADA compliant. 4) By then the hostess was there, and my companion, told her that we were a party of two for dinner. She seated the family that was there before us, and came back and told us there were no tables and we'd have to wait. We had to get to a movie so we questioned this. The hostess told us she only had booths. I asked if he could sit at the end of one of these, but she said no, he couldn't block the walkways. At this point, I looked into the dining room and saw a plain table just sitting there. I asked ""What about that one?"" She looked at me and said, ""That's a table for 5."" There was no one behind us, no one walking up, no one pulling up in the parking lot. I said ""There's a table we could use right there."" She looked at me condescendingly and said ""It's for 5."" By this point, Ken, in an attempt to get us fed and to our movie, pointed out that one end of the bar had been lowered to accommodate a wheelchair and said we could just eat there. The hostess told us that was for takeout customers and she'd have to talk to her manager.  We thought that would help, but the manager was just as clueless. Ken had already left the desk and was wheeling around looking for options when she came out and told him those open tables were in a closed section.  Were two pizzas brought to a closed section that much of an inconvenience? Was it worth the discriminatory practices, the ill will, and lack of present and future business? This location seems to think so. The fictional party of 5 that may never have come was more important that my wheelchair bound friend and I. By this time, we had spent 15 - 20 minutes trying to reason with these poorly trained young women. We had to give up and move on. They weren't going to serve us, despite having empty tables, and there was nothing we could do. So we left. Sonic got our money instead and they were pleasant about it. I'm still angry at the injustice of it all. At this point I can only hope that California Pizza Kitchen does a better job training its people and making its restaurants more accessible to wheelchair bound people.  They should be ashamed!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-plymouth-meeting,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005
