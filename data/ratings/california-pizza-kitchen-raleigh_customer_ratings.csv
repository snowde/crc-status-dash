It's my family's to go place when we can't make up our mind. This particular CPK is bad. I've gone here several times since I work in the area and have been disappointed on several occasions. This first time, I ordered to go. I only had an hour lunch and they said it would be ready in 20 minutes. I got there after 25 minutes and it wasn't ready. I waited an additional 30 minutes for my food. So my lunch was wasted because I had to wait. The second time I had an issue was I ordered a half salad to go. It was $10 and when I got back to work I swear there was barely any salad in the box. I got ripped off! The portions for take out aren't the same as eating in the restaurant. Lastly, I took my sister to lunch and they put us at a dirty table. It had crumbs and drink rings on the table.

Yes, Friends, California Pizza Kitchen has let me down.   I could almost excuse the spotty service (it was Saturday night and they were busy).  I can hardly complain about a raspberry basil martini (minus the basil) that showed up 20 minutes after I ordered it, even though it was nothing but raspberry puree with ice (no, I don't believe there was any alcohol in it), because the manager did comp it.  And I can ignore not being offered bread, grated parm and crushed red pepper, even though all the tables around us had them all within seconds of ordering.  Oh, and it's certainly an honest mistake to refill my unsweet tea with sweet tea... even as the server is confirming that I do, indeed, want unsweet tea. I could ignore it all, if only the pizza was still as tasty as it once was.  Sadly, it's not. We got the Sicilian, which, if you've not experienced it, is a thin crust carnivore's delight... or it should be.  This pizza, while overflowing with ingredients, just didn't taste as good as it once did.  What went wrong?  All we could conclude is that maybe the ingredients are not up the quality they once were.   Extra cardboard is still cardboard. On the plus side, the grilled veggie salad we shared was as good as it's always been, and the new flatbread app we tried was tasty.   You know, I might even excuse the pizza... but then our server started pushing dessert and a box when it was obvious we were far from finishing our meal.
