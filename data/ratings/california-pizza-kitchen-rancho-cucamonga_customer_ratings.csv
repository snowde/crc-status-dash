269,JC D.,"Glendora, CA",30,53,46.0,1.0,2012-01-03,"We visited the place Friday night (12/30/2011) Service in this place is terrible. After waiting for 45mins and while seated down waiting for the order to come after an hour this is what we got... How could you forget the appetizers. Even after 3 follow ups with the servers it never came. The manager (Andrew) came to our table and apologized and offered to comp the appetizer still it's not worth it. The place was not really that full. Imagine ordering a M&Ms ice cream if never came on time. You can see that the dessert was left at the counter for a long time because the ice cream has already melted. and to account on the refills of the drinks, you will really have to wait for a long time, they even forgot to refill the drinks until you called them the second time. But the worst thing adding insult to injury. We ordered a take home of seafood fettuccine and we waited, waited and waited. Until to the point that all the cooks were already eating and only three tables were occupied including our table. I really got to the point of heat that I called the server and he went to the kitchen and guess what, the food has been standing there for a long time. I  told the server that ""So it was just sitting there for a long time and his reply was "" it's still warm anyway"" what a service. And you expect this reply from the servers and not apologize for the delay or for the wait for the food.I finally ask him to call the manager. Then guess who came out THE COOK, is my problem the food, if it was the food I could understand it would be the cook or the chef but it was the SERVICE. Finally the manager Andrew came out. He was offering a comp on all the bills and we decline his offer. It's not about the the FREE meal that you can offer to your dissatisfied customer, it's all about managing your servers and running the place. The incompetence of the servers and definitely the organization of this place is terrible. I am filling a formal complaint of this place at the headquarters for the never ending insult on the service.

If think really hard and i'd have to say to sum up CPK, its pizza fusion. Unorthodox items combined in a fashion that compliments each other that somehow adds an idea of it being gourmet pizza.

The pizza is always hit or miss with me. It seems though that I have a found a pizza there that I truly enjoy. That pizza is the Pear & Gorgonzola.

100,Christoph J.,"Santa Monica, CA",3,31,15.0,1.0,2012-05-28,"2 Adults: Ordered Hanger 24, Arnold Palmer, Chicken Lettuce Wraps, Thin Crust Pepperoni Pizza, Chicken Club sandwich. Sadly, Hanger 24 and Arnold Palmer were the best parts of the meal! We have been going to CPKs for years and have for the most part liked their food. This particular CPK is hit or miss and has recently been mostly a miss. Not sure if they are under new management or have a new chef but after today's mega miss, we will not be stepping foot back in any CPK for a very long time... The chicken lettuce wraps (something we get every time because the first time and many subsequent time, they were excellent) were just o k. Meanwhile, we were sitting at the bar so we could see the food coming out of the oven and watched our pizza come out of the oven and sit for a good 5 minutes along with the sandwich in the expedite area. When it did make its way to us not only was it cold but it was chewy. Yes chewy. Chewy like you had to pull with your teeth like you were eating beef jerky! I have had bad pizza before but this was a whole new low. I don't even know how you get it like that but the chefs there sure achieved it... The sandwich (pictures attached) was AWFUL! (So bad it was deserving of caps.) It had a tons of mayo, thick slices of chicken (this was respectable), what appeared to be an avocado spread (perhaps they were sliced avocados but they were squished into the mayo) wilted lettuce chunks like the kind you use on a salad, and about 10 specks of bacon (see pics). for an $11 sandwich that is being called a ""club"" I was expecting it to have bacon. I don't need strips necessarily but i do need bacon. It was the equivalent of less than 1/2 of a slice of bacon. Seriously? if I am paying $11 for a sandwich I think I should get whole slice at least... It was served with a Caesar salad but it could have been just mayo on lettuce with croutons and shaved Parmesan. Again, sitting on the counter for 5 minutes left the lettuce wilted and well, quite inedible. Never going back here again! The service was great (minus the whole 5 minute on the counter thing but that wasn't the bartenders fault)... if you want decent food, go to the food court!

It was like ravioli nachos. WTH am I eating????? This has so many things wrong with it I can't even begin to tell. Brother had a Cobb salad thing that was good size, but as far as salads go, it was run of the mill.  Service- Poor. The waiter only had 3 tables, the patio. We never got refills, and was hard to even get his attention to get the bill. Worst part. My brother salad came out with extras on it.

290,R S.,"Pomona, CA",0,7,,1.0,2013-01-28,"12 years ago I fell in love with this place, and throughout the past 12 years we have been through some ups and downs.  But most recently I have encountered more downs, which leads me to a path of divorcing this place! We had a great start when I was pregnant with my first child, we ate there almost every weekend and some.  Within the past five years I have sent 3 complaints to corporate. The first one which irate me and sent me fuming was when they charged me for a child's water cup and when I brought it up to the waitress, she claimed that that was their policy. huh? I spoke to  the manager who cleared up the situation after the  restaurant's patrons were starring and whispering sweet nothings to one another about the crazy lady who doesn't want to cough up a dollar for the drink of tap water!  Second incident was the restaurants overall appearance and staff. I have to admit the last two corporate complaints I have sent were for the facility in Rancho, but have experienced this in other cities/states as well. The staff is tarting to act like Walmart employees, they just don't give a damn. I received a response immediately inviting me back with a free offer, and of course, the next time I visited with offer in hand, they rolled out the red carpet for us!  Last one was the food quality. I may be getting out of hand here but Denny's may be a better place to eat. CPK provides you with a big plate of pasta and 8 small pieces of chicken for your dish.hmmmm.... Really, I'm paying 13.00 a plate for an ambiance that sucks, staff that couldn't care less and no meat on your plate. Every plate you order has less meat and their chicken is so tough and chewy. I don't know about you but chicken should not be chewy! I put another call through for this and a few other past instances of bad- pricey food issues and they sent me another sweet offer.  I had the last experience about a month ago with the waitress coming to our table to let us know that they ran out of pasta for a dish my hubby ordered and she can substitute for what they have in hand. We obliged and said sure, by the way the waitress was not sympathetic to their stupid mistake. We received his order ,once again with two pieces of shrimp and 4 pieces of chicken and half of the  pasta. Wow! here we go again, I asked the waitress what happened to the pasta, there are only a few penne. She responds with, oh this is the new menu with less everything, some guiltless crap New menu they have. I laughed and she said would you like some more pasta and I immediately said yes. It took them 15minutes to bring the pasta out to my hubby. The kids and I had finished our food by the time hishad arrived. Moral of this long ass winded story is, don't go there, instead try the other array of restaurants, such as Yard House or Lucille's. It may be a longer wait but you wont be disappointed. Pricey, food amount is little to nothing, rip off, rude waitress and waiters, and unkept.  Front girl greeters are really nice.  My two children who are 11 and 6 and the hubby and I have decided to never step foot in this restaurant again.

It was cold in places not near a heater... and considering it was Christmas time... the fake snow turned on during our meal.

I say this not from a single recent experience, but multiple ones at more than one location. (I include here the Palm Desert location which has exactly the same issues!) Okay. The problem is horrendous service. I mean truly horrendous.  At both places, it took more than twenty minutes for the many people working there to even take our drink orders. At the Palm Desert location, I even had to ask one of the servers who had spent the last twenty minutes playing with glasses behind a bar, and she seemed truly insulted that I would ask for service.  Both locations had plenty of workers, but none seemed interested in serving the customers. The people who finally served us did a so-so job.  The food is okay, but the serving sizes are smaller than ever. You have to ask for bread and they don't ask if you want more. All in all, I plan on never going to this chain again.  The only reason I went in the first place was I had some gift cards. A few years back, I had experienced similar bad service at another one of their locations. At no time did a manager offer to give us desert or comp us our drinks. Nothing, despite the obvious bad service.  If you enjoy poor service, this is your place, otherwise you'd get much better service and product at the Palm Spring walk in Pizza Hut on Highway 111.These people provide great service and a product even better than California Pizza Kitchen. I do not like to criticize restaurants and their workers who are on minimum wage working for tips, but when there's a multiple similar experience, I believe I have an obligation to others and the establishment to let them know what is going on.

286,Linds S.,"Redlands, CA",0,33,,4.0,2013-05-23,"We came here before, about a year ago, and I left dissatisfied. I remember it being pricy and not very good. However, we came here a few weeks ago after a day of shopping at Victoria Gardens, and the experience was much better. Hubby ordered the veggie pizza. I ordered the barbecue chicken salad. And for my picky eater, we ordered the mac n cheese, edamame, and fresh fruit. They've made a few adjustments since the last time we came. First, my salad was ginormous. I ordered the full-size, and it was enough to eat for dinner and take home for the next day. I love when I can get two meals out of a meal, especially when it's a little more on the expensive side. Also, instead of cold sliced bread with your meal, you now get a roll cut into pieces with an olive oil/herb dipping sauce. It is delish! We all enjoyed our food, and everyone had leftovers due to the large portions you get for your money.  Our server was also really sweet. It is still a chain, though, and I always have trouble dropping 50 bucks on dinner for a chain restaurant, but I'll look past this because I did feel like it was a nice outing for everyone, capping off our day at Vic Gardens with the family. When I feel like splurging, we will probably come here again. Most likely, I will recommend it for special occasions with the parents and in-laws, when overspending on one meal isn't so big of a deal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-rancho-cucamonga?start=300,2.6,2.6,2.6,2.416,2.6

177,Kim S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,3,,1.0,2013-08-03,"Unbelievably terrible experience there today! It is a hot, Saturday afternoon and after checking out some books at the library, I thought I'd take the kids there to cool off with some ice cream. I specifically asked the hostess if we could order the $1.00 kid's desserts for the same price without having to purchase the meal. She didn't know so she asked the manager, Tony, over his headpiece and he said it would be okay. We got seated at a table and the waiter came for our order. We asked for ice water and I mentioned what the manager said and that we'd like to order the desserts. The waiter said that it'd cost more since we weren't purchasing the meal and I countered that the manager (Tony) said otherwise. He said he would check and sent me a different manager by the name of Samantha who declared that it would ""only be 50 cents more"" per dessert since it wasn't being ordered with the child's menu. I thought to myself, well, if it's ONLY .50 more per dessert, then why doesn't CPK pick up the slack since they miscommunicated everything from the start? I replied to Samantha that Tony, the other manager, said otherwise and that I'd like to speak with him. Meanwhile, my kids are sitting there wide-eyed and bushy-tailed, practically salivating on the table while waiting to sink their teeth into some hot fudge ice cream!  The original manager approached me with a stern look on his face. I greeted him congenially and continued to explain to him the issue at hand. He responded that the hostess did not tell him that it would cost the same $1.00 amount, but that he was stating that it would only be okay to order the dessert outside of ordering from the kid's meal. I replied to Tony that this is not what I inquired and his only lame response was that he'd have a talk with the hostess. So here he is, playing hard ball over 50 extra cents per dessert. Does bad PR cost $2.00? He's actively blaming the hostess instead of taking responsibility and allowing the customer to have a memorable and lasting experience at his restaurant. I responded that I and the children would be leaving now and that we would not come back for future visits and he simply said that's fine and walked away! Can you believe this? What a stinking racket! CPK in Rancho Cucamonga has no business sense and no customer service whatsoever. All this over a few cents? Wow!

Though they were mighty busy on a Saturday at 2pm, and occasionally a water glass didn't get filled right away, the big stuff is what matters. And that came through nicely. I never order appetizers, it seems, if I'm the only one likely to eat something a little adventurous (read: 'spicy'). But, I couldn't resist trying The Sausage + Poblano Flatbread. The sausage part wasn't that spicy, though it had some flavor alright. The poblano is what said HELLO in no uncertain terms. And we'd still be on speaking terms, the poblano and me, had I not devoured it. Mmmm.  I followed that up with the Caesar salad (adding chicken breast, gotsa to pack some protein, may-an). The Half portion is plenty, as memory serves. And this serves a hearty portion. Pretty darn good --- not overly dressing-ed.  The bread basket is not really necessary, but they offered, so we took 'em up on it. Just fine. I'm told the Lemonade is good. And the Pasta Bolognese got very high marks from a discerning (and hungry) young guy.  All in all: glad to patronize this CPK. Food and price reasonable. And the physical structure? Attractive and not overwhelming. The room itself isn't too loud, which to me, is something to cherish. Especially when there's lotsa hungry people.

Now you're probably wondering if they have Pizza...YES they do! It's ""California Pizza Kitchen"" after all. But it's not your typical pizza per se. I like to call it California fancy...as in non traditional pizza sauce, cheese and pepperoni (however they do have that option as well). There's Thai Chicken, Habanero Carnitas and California Club. They even have thin crust which I particularly like maybe because I feel like there are less carbs. But a few of the thin crust selections are Jamaican Jerk Chicken, Tostada, Sicilian and Pear + Gorgonzola. They also have salads, pasta and sandwiches, so something for everyone! FOOD: Here are a few of my favorites: -BBQ CHICKEN SALAD: You can order a half or full order. I usually order a half and substitute spinach for the iceberg lettuce. Rating (3-4 stars depending on my mood) -CARMELIZED PEACH SALAD: I typically don't like fruit in my salad, but on a nice sunny day (because we have plenty of those here in SoCal) it gives it a clean taste to the salad. The gorgonzola cheese balances out the sweetness of the peaches.  -BBQ CHICKEN PIZZA: It's got chicken, bbq sauce, cheese, onions and cilantro. Can't go wrong! (3-4 stars depending on my mood) -SICILIAN PIZZA: You get Italian sausage, spicy capicola ham, salami on top of cheese and spicy marinara sauce. Don't get frightened...it's not that spicy...just more of a slight kick or nudge if you will.  SERVICE: Well, on this particular day it was rather slow. Granted we did dine during peak lunch hour (around noon), so that may have been the reason. I had to request the complementary bread at least 2 times, I had to flag down another server to get a refill on my iced tea and when we asked the server if he could split the bill after he gave us our check, he gave us the ""no we can't"" answer when I know it's been done before. He also wasn't the most friendliest and when I teasingly pointed out that the table next to us got their bread even though they came 10 minutes after us, he got a bit defensive and responded with a slight attitude. Like I said, it was lunch hour so I'll give him the benefit of the doubt even though deep inside I feel like he could have given us at least a smile.  PRICING: It's fair for a sit down establishment. One person could dine for about $10-$20 depending on what you order and if you order a drink.

198,Shelbi A.,"Raleigh, NC",35,42,19.0,2.0,2014-05-20,"I took my daughter out to the see the Ballet as a special 'mommy and me' day out. (Lewis Family Playhouse is just a stones throw from CPK - so we decided to eat here). The hostess gave us a seat in an awkward location; being that they were busy and all, the table sat at the very front and we had a few people leaning into our dining table, hands up on the rails right near us - talking loudly, all while waiting for their table. This felt like we had to 'yell' over the people and also felt like an invasion on our little dinner 'space'. It was after all, our special day out, and we wanted to enjoy our conversation, not feel like we had to talk over people, or be crowded out of our own table.  I asked the hostess if we could move, and she told us that we would have to 'wait' it out until another table was available. It wasn't what she said, but how she said it.   I have worked in restaurants a majority of my life (started when I was 16) and I know when staff is busy, they can come off 'gruff'. This was not gruff.  The hostess seemed highly irritated and it was putting a damper on our special night out. I have learned to disregard people like this, and go straight to the manager, and wouldn't you know it, we were promptly and sweetly moved to another table. problem solved. As for the food, it was just ok. I use to love CPK, but it just feels like they have lost their love or their soul for making quality meals.

First off the service is hit or miss. Never really super sometimes almost bad.  Tonight the male manager came out to ask how things were that was a first and nice. I was busy and couldn't tell him I was doing okay till I went in the ladies room. Ugh I usually would have just got up and left the restaurant but this time I was with my family and was trying to be good.  I went in and the first stall had feces all over the toilet!!! Really? Looks like someone stood on it and blew out their intestines!!  The server was nice and I was trying to be good so I didn't even say a word. My step mom went in and almost puked. ""I forgot to warn her"" :( so anyways.  We ordered and food came out. The girl ""not our server"" took our food to another table! When they said more then a few times it wasn't their order she just stood there. So we told her it was ours. Kinda embarrassing to have to speak up... Could of let her continue to stand there asking again and again looking lost I guess?  I really wish I got our servers name. He was super nice and bc of him we stayed without complaint. If you want to go here please do. The food is almost always amazing. Service could go either way.. Cleanliness? Hummm not so sure this one gets a good grade.  Oh yeah..

And the food was subpar to some of their other locations will not be coming back here. Let me start off by saying I Love CPK but tonight I was extremely disappointed by the service and food. We where told the wait would be 15 minutes the hostess seemed to be in a bad mood and we actually waited 30 minutes. We finally sat down at a table and ordered 4 waters with lemon along with 2 sangrias and 2 non alcoholic beverages. The waters and non alcoholic drinks came out promptly as expected shortly after came the sangrias. The lemons took 15 minutes to come out. The sangrias where not on point AT ALL! Full of ice and not enough of the actual drink. The appetizer we ordered was a spinach and artichoke dip that tasted like it had been sitting on the stove on low heat and the same thing with the chips. One pizza was bland the other was drenched in dressing.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-rancho-cucamonga?start=120,3.48,2.98,2.98,2.8200000000000003,3.18

There were only a handful of people inside and we were seated immediately. Our server was really nice and he would kneel down to talk to us. Yes, eye level is always nice, right? My husband ordered The Original BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad with a Diet Coke and I got The Original BBQ Chicken Pizza with a lemonade.  While we were eating, a large group came in and our server got busy with them, but a female server stepped in and got our refills for us when she noticed we were low on our drinks.  At the end of our meal, my husband noticed that there was a crack in his bowl. This happened to him before at another restaurant, but fortunately the bowl wasn't chipped. (One time, my husband actually had broken pieces of the bowl mixed into his salad.) So when our server came back, he informed him of the long crack and advised that they don't use that bowl anymore. He apologized and said he would throw it away. No harm, no foul so we asked for the bill. Our server shared a horrific story of when he ate at Cheesecake Factory and they still had the toothpick inside in food which went through his lip... *ouch*! To my surprise, our server gave us a discount on our bill for the cracked bowl. Wow, I wasn't expecting that. I left the same amount I was going to pay anyway, so he got a bigger tip from me.  ;) 211/100 Reviews for 2014",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-rancho-cucamonga?start=40,3.68,3.01,3.01,2.8320000000000003,3.278

First she comes by our table like 4 times to let us know she's going to come take our drink order, you don't need to remind me 100 times that you will be right back. I ordered an un sweetened ice tea she brings me a sweetened one, not a big deal. I drink it anyways. Then we proceed to order food they ran out of egg rolls ok, we order spinach dip and a small pineapple and pepperoni pizza.  First our food and appetizer come out at the same time. Annoying! The pizza comes out without pineapple, we finally proceed to tell the waitress at this point I'm starting to get annoyed. When she comes over we tell her the pizza has no pineapple she stands there in disbelief and proceeds to ask us if the pizza has pineapples? LMAO yes Sherlock we just told you and you can clearly see its pineapple less, so she sighs and walks away and comes back with a plate of cold pineapple chunks! Who the fuck puts large cold pineapple chunks on pizza first off and second I didn't realize this was a make your own pizza place where they bring you the toppings you heat them up and place them on the pizza yourself.  At this point I'm pissed so she comes over a couple mins later to ask how the food was. I point to the pineapple chunks on the plate and I proceed to ask her if she would eat that?  She stares at me at for a second and brings over another waiter, not the manager.  He grabs the plate and says in an obviously annoyed manner and says, "" I guess we'll fix it"". I said we don't need your attitude, then he proceeds to argue with me that he didn't give me attitude.  You would think at this point the manager should have been involved.

She said they were pretty big and big enough for us to share one. We took her word and ordered 1 pizza to share. When she brought it out, we were confused because the pizza was really small. It had 6 small slices & it was more of an appetizer than a meal. Their crust use to be thick but the pizza that she had brought out, had really really thin crust. So thin that the pizza was falling apart when we picked up our slices, it was also really greasy. Their pizzas aren't the same anymore sadly.  Our bill ended up being $40 which was ridiculous. I didn't even get a drink, I just ordered a glass of water. My boyfriend got lemonade and he also ordered a small appetizer. So basically $40 for a tiny pizza, appetizer and 1 drink? we felt extremely ripped off and we weren't full at all. We left hungry and ended up making something to eat at home.

Unfortunately, instead of being able to eat as a family, we ended up eating at separate times because the service was terrible. My mom and my pasta had to be sent back because it was very salty. The drinks came out very late and was incorrect, and there was a bug in my water. The cups were dirty, and the water had floaties in it (in spite of having to ask for a different cups of water). The manager came by and apologized for the bad food and explained that they have to salt the water every 30 minutes, and we must have gotten a freshly salted batch. Eventually, after my dad has finished his meal, the waitress brought out our entrees. If the first plates saltiness factor was an 9/10, then this new plate was an 8/10. Not wanting to wait another hour of poor service, we just bagged the food and ordered a pizza to split between me and my mom. After all this and a few apologies for dirty cups, dirty water, super salty food, no refills, late drinks, and an overall disappointing experience, not one cent of our meal was comped. I'm pretty sure she even over charged us extra for a refill for a soft drink. What we wanted as a special night out as a family to celebrate ended up being a disappointing disaster.

They are extremely busy on weekends and most night, hence why we have a lunch date mid week in the afternoon (1ish). So be prepared to wait if you come on a Sunday afternoon.

Our server, Jose, started off the night as seemingly attentive and we were excited to be at our first California Pizza Kitchen in quite a while.  However, things quickly took a turn for the worse. I noticed Jose would pass our table attending to other customers to check up on them, but he rarely stopped by our table. He was clearly busy and would say a short, ""everything good here?"" in passing, without allowing much time for us to respond. He never checked to see if our table needed water or additional bread, as we had to flag down another server who would respond in a much more appropriate manner.  When our food arrived, he haphazardly tried to hand us our plates, which I thought was extremely odd for any sort of dine-in experience. Why would he try to reach with his arms outstretched to hand a large plate with a pizza to someone sitting diagonally across from him? If the food was too hot, it would've presented a danger to my guests, and if they didn't have a firm grip, the food would have fallen. This is completely unacceptable behavior for any sort of server in the most standard of restaurants. Definitely not the type of service I expect from California Pizza Kitchen. Since our party was large, we wanted to have a total of two separate checks and when it came time to pay, he presented them to us in one folder, which made it very frustrating to pay with. When we asked for boxes for our leftovers, he came back with less than what we needed and no bags. Jose as a server overall was inattentive, careless, and slow. I do not know if this was an off night or if the restaurant was understaffed, but this made for an unpleasant experience to say the least.

I've been going to CPK for years and the one thing I can say is that the food is consistently good. I usually go to the Chino Hills location but this time I was meeting a friend in Rancho so there I was. The problem is with the bill. I honestly almost NEVER check my bill and maybe that's my own fault but I trust the check to be right. This time however I figured $105 is a bit much for 2 dinners and 2 drinks. When I checked the bill I saw they had charged for an extra drink and an entire dish I never ordered. How the heck did that happen? I told the waiter It's a good thing I checked and he replied Yes it's a good thing you did. Isn't that their job NOT to overcharge me??? I think every time a restaurant overcharges a customer and they get caught they should take an item off the bill. Anyways folks always check your bill. I am petrified to think how many hundreds of dollars I have been paying for food I never ordered.

55,Bianca S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",119,131,294.0,2.0,2017-02-12,I used to come here quite often when I worked at the mall and I love their roasted vegetable salad. I wanted something fresh and healthy today so I decided to call in two salads and I added chicken to both (one for my sister) and we also put in an order for avocado egg rolls.  They took my order as soon as I called and they told me my order would be ready in about 15-20 minutes. I went to pick it up 20 minutes after and they were busy which I expect for a Sunday afternoon.  I went to the back of the bar to pick up my order and I stood there for almost 10 mins before the bartender asked me if I had been helped. Several employees walked past me and saw me looking around and did not say one word to me. I told her I was picking up an order and she asked me to give her a minute. I waited about 6-7 more minutes and she just disappeared. Finally another employee approached me and asked me if I had been helped and I told her I've been waiting for almost 20 minutes and I just want to pick up my order.  She said it wasn't her section but she would help me. Literally she just had to ring me up. No apology for the wait or anything. Clearly specular service isn't expected for a simple take out order but I don't expect to wait 20 minutes with employees staring at me and not saying one word.

It's the best, even though I'm not really a fan of thin crust pizza's. For some reason it really works with this particular pizza flavor. This location is always busy since it is located in Victoria Gardens so be prepared for a wait. At least with it being located with shops you can browse around while you wait to be called. They do give you a buzzer so you can't really go far. It would be helpful if they adapted the call out system where it texts your phone so you can wander around the nearby shops.  The service is pretty decent here. When I visited the waitress was pretty attentive. I forgot her name or else I would include it in my review. As mentioned previously I really only get their BBQ Chicken pizza. But I have tried their fried Mac and cheese appetizer before and it is delicious!

I'm really into customer service from my last job and Alex our waiter did a great job. It was our first time and we only got a 25$ meal with a gift card and we were still treated great. We got a sample of some sort of bread for free and that was awesome. The beer came cold with a lime and a nice mug to pour it in. Our pizza was delicious.

16,Cadence C.,"West Covina, CA",342,19,4.0,5.0,2017-08-27,"My boyfriend and I had a wonderful lunch date at this CPK. The only negative thing I have to say was that the two hostesses didn't greet us when we walked in - they made us wait while they finished their conversation before acknowledging us. Not the best first impression, but it was all uphill from there. The inside of the restaurant is clean, bright, and modern. Our waiter was fabulous throughout the whole meal. He gave me great advice when I was choosing a pizza and even said that if I didn't like it, he would gladly bring me something else. I ordered a sangria flight and the Chipotle Chicken pizza. The sangria flight came with three variations of sangria and each was more delicious than the next. They were on the very sweet side but I personally love sweet drinks, so I enjoyed them a lot. I was a bit skeptical about ordering a very non-traditional pizza. However, I ended up loving the Chipotle Chicken pizza so much I ate the whole thing! Topped with corn, poblano peppers, black beans, chicken, and more, it was definitely different but very delicious. It was served with a side of cilantro crema that perfectly complemented the other flavors of the pizza. Wonderful meal and (mostly) wonderful service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-rancho-cucamonga?start=40,4.04,3.5,3.268,,3.716

Their food is pretty good, service has always been good. The times I've gone parking has never been that bad and the place is always clean. I also like how you could order food as take out.  Today I got the lunch special with a half turkey sandwich and a bowel of baked potato soup. The sandwich was really good with the apples and dressing while the baked potato soup didn't disappoint either.

I love Sangria and was very excited to try the sangria flight (little glasses with about 3 oz of each flavor they offer) Well I ordered it and didn't get it until I was almost finished with my meal. The waiter said it was because ""they couldn't find any little glasses"" which was odd because the restaurant was pretty empty and I didn't see it on any other table. My pizza was delicious, but i think it's really strange that they don't offer as many different pizzas as they used to.

When dining there this evening, my two year old son unexpectedly started to projectile vomit. He had just climbed into my lap so I was basically head to toe in throw up and he was too. The manger Joselyn, stepped up with damp towels, brought bags for his clothing and even helped wiped my son down herself while I was trying to clean up. After we finally got somewhat decent I asked for our check. Joselyn then comped our bill and wrapped up my sons food to go. The service we experienced was definitely above and beyond.

42,Diamond M.,"Rialto, CA",98,120,201.0,1.0,2017-10-09,"Came in this past sunday at 2pm for a birthday lunch with my daughter. (she picked it, i had never been) party of 5 i approached the hostess and was told the wait would be about 30mins. ok, i put my name down and we waited about 15mins, not so bad. Our waiter let us know he would be a minute he was pretty busy. He came and took our order, i was saddened to learn they did not have brunch but i ordered a Mimosa anyways. He asked me what a mimosa was (?) so i told him what it was and how to spell it as he took my order. I put in my small children's order because they were ""starving"" it took a bit for our drinks to come out but my kids spaghetti came out quick, then we ordered. We got the spinach dip app which was good.  My kids 7yrs,5yrs) complained their spaghetti was dry. It looked pretty dry so i asked for extra sauce. Our waiter was on top of it and brought them out some extra. My spaghetti came out and it too looked lightly sauced so i asked for a side of sauce. It was just ""ok"" my daughter got the carne asada pizza and liked it. Our waiter did bring out bread with olive oil so that was nice because we didnt order it. He also brought us a side of ranch dressing (we didnt order) it was piping hot. I had to ask what it was because i thought it was ranch but it was super hot so i was confused, also because we didnt order it. it was just weird.  We finished our meal and i asked for the check. I had ordered 2 Mimosas and my daughters boyfriend ordered 1. As i looked over the check we were charged 8.99 for the mimosas (as advertised) plus 2.00 extra PER mimosa??? what the...I called the waiter over and asked what the 2$ charge was for, he said because there was some champagne in the split bottle that didnt fit in the glass, that's what i was being up charged for..Ummmmm no. I explained to the young man that the mimosa was 8.99 as per the menu price and i have NEVER been charged extra because the split didnt fit in the glass, it never does! so he took it to the manager and brought it back and pointed out that they had ""comped"" my drinks. I said ok, i just wanted the 2$ extra charge for each mimosa taken off. He asked if i was ok, i said yes and he walked away. I did see that the check said Comp 32$ then i looked at the price and it was just about the same. so i re-reviewed the check and although it had the 32 removed they did add the charges for the champagne minus the 2$ chargers...Which i had no problem with paying but dont tell me ""look they comped you 32$"" when they didnt. I was over it, i paid my +$100 check, thanked them and left. I would never go back. the Service was good but the food is not. especially for that price. Also their ""suggested"" tip amount was way off. i'll post a pic. i figured their percents were off because of the alleged ""comp"" but still. quit playing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-rancho-cucamonga,3.84,3.49,3.268,,3.6300000000000003

I asked the 3 ladies working in the front booth how much longer they told me another 15minutes...15 minutes passed & nothing.. I stuck around waiting for more than 40 minutes and haven't been called yet.. I asked the ladies how much longer they said  I had 5 people ahead of me to be seated.
