I usually don't complain about price increases but CPK's has been especially regrettable. The prices have nearly tripled since I was a teenager (but inflation hasn't, lol) and the quality of the food has gone down. (I remember half an oriental chicken salad used to be 6 bucks!) Everything here is now only so so and sometimes even poor, and it pains me to say it!!! UGH. I hate HATE how they changed the oriental chicken salad--it's so dry and tasteless now and I hate that they got rid of the Shanghai Spring Rolls.

I have nothing negative to say. So, do I recommend you come here for lunch or dinner?? Sure!! Keep in mind, they do not have a lunch menu so expect to pay their regular menu price.  The reason for the three stars is due to the service. It was slow. I took awhile for the food to come out and even longer time for us to get the check. I was also disappointed that we didn't get the complimentary bread and butter, Like I mentioned earlier, they do not have a lunch menu. I know you can opt to get a half size salad for lunch. Their pizzas are about $14 (a little on the pricey side). Most entrees will cost you about that much.

I ordered the Jamaican Jerk Chicken pizza and it was the only thing I had eaten that day before I started feeling sick...then it all went downhill :( I kept having to hunt down the waitress for everything I needed; refill, water, napkin. She was not very attentive and the restaurant was not packed. She was friendly...so, that's a plus.  They have expanded their menu but they took out a few of my favorite dishes including my ultimate favorite...the Carne Asada pizza. They replaced it with carnitas but I'm allergic to pork so that doesn't work for me. There are a lot of salad, pizza, and pasta choices. The Arugula salad is delish!

187,Dee J.,"Los Angeles, CA",129,8,,1.0,2013-01-10,"I was not impressed with the food during my latest trip to CPK. I'm typically delighted to visit CPK and get a slice of their famous BBQ chicken pizza. However, after today, I might not come back. I also experienced similar food quality at the CPK in Manhattan Beach so this appears to be a pattern.     The waitress was friendly; hardly anything special. We sat next to particularly loud Australian tourists (but that's another story). I sat across from my brother who ordered the same thing I did; BBQ chicken pizza. I was so hungry and couldn't wait for the bread to come. Unfortunately, the bread was a small piece of warm sourdough cut into four pieces with a little oil for dipping on the side. I've been eating at CPK since I was old enough for a kids menu so I typically remember their bread being more abundant and having a little butter. Previously, the bread was always very thick and was constantly brought to the table by the waitress before we could finish it all. It was their signature. Alas, all good things must come to an end so I was going to forgive them of their sub par dinner bread that we got just one plate of...until the pizza came.      I also remember having cloth napkins instead of paper but never mind; what's a few thousand trees for your dining pleasure? Anywho, the pizza came. It was a burnt, disgusting mess. I ate because I was hungry but I didn't enjoy it. The taste was all wrong. I almost wished I just bought their store-bought frozen option instead. My brother didn't seem to notice a difference but he typically inhales food. The onion just didn't seem fresh and juicy. THe BBQ chicken was splattered on there. I was just unimpressed period.     CPK, I'm begging you. I really want to make this work. I'm trying to make amends here. You know, for the kids. But in sum, my experience sucked and I wanted the world to know. CPK please get your management, chefs, and oven temperature together.

89,Renee C.,"Long Beach, CA",11,61,2.0,1.0,2013-03-09,"This review is for the facility and service at this particular location.  In general CPK is great, but I'm disappointed this location has gone downhill.  When this was the only CPK around (10+ years ago), I would drive a half hour to eat here and it was my favorite restaurant.  Now, I'd rather go to the one in South Torrance. I'll start with the staff.  Went to the bar just for drinks and the bartender was so aloof it was like he didn't care at all about service.  Mixed up the two kinds of red wine a friend and I ordered, brought us the wrong size pours, kept asking if we were ready to order even though we said when we sat down that we were only having drinks, and never brought the water I asked for.   The bathrooms are DISGUSTING! I realize this is at a shopping mall so there's a lot of traffic, but that doesn't mean that a nice sit-down restaurant where people are spending upwards of $30 per person by the time they get out the door should have a bathroom more suited to a gas station.  Actually, I've been in MANY gas station bathrooms that are more pleasant than this one.  On a busy weekend night, they need to stay on top of the cleanliness much better. Both of these factors are a huge turnoff to ever return to a place that clearly doesn't value customer experience.  I guess when you're in such a busy location and customers keep streaming through no matter how crappy the service is and how dirty the restaurant, why would you try any harder? It's a shame because I think as a whole CPK has a lot to offer and a great menu, but stay away from this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-redondo-beach?start=160,3.4,3.4,3.4,3.0120000000000005,3.4000000000000004

Garlic chicken pizza: ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! This pizza had garlic, chicken, carmelized onions, fresh mozzarella, parmesan, slivered scallions and cracked black pepper. The combination of flavors was amazing! Honestly, you don't even need the chicken on this pizza. The flavors from the garlic, cheese and onions makes this a winner in my books!  Habanero carnitas pizza: A pizza with carnitas pork, red onions and cilantro. The habanero salsa is served on the side. The combination is great. I remember the first time I got the pizza, the habanero salsa was ridiculously hot, but I'm assuming they got some complaints since this past time it wasn't that hot at all. It's a great pizza with great flavor! Jambalaya fettucine: The jambalaya here isn't my favorite. Maybe it's because I prefer my jambalaya with rice?

They don't seem controlled by the users, as opposed to other restaurants. I smell something fishy here. Anyhow. Other than their sketchy Yelp pages, I am a fan of CPK. I find myself craving it ALL the time, and I've already been here a countless number of times since high school.  Located basically within the mall, this is a great restaurant to go to after a long day of shopping. The food is solid, the service is solid, and they give free bread. Any restaurant that gives out free bread is a friend of mine. The parking around CPK is rarely pleasant. Most parking spots are going to be found far from the restaurant, but the walk isn't too bad. You need to be careful though, because my cousin's car was broken into once here. FOOD * BBQ Chicken Pizza (5/5) My favorite pizza here. It doesn't hurt that I love barbecue sauce, but bbq sauce + pizza?! Um, this will be a 5/5 for me! The chicken is moist and flavorful, and the crust is perfect. Usually I don't eat pizza crusts, but I always eat their pizza crusts with this pizza. * Waldorf Chicken Salad (5/5) Ahhhhh. I love this salad sooo much. It includes everything you could possibly need in a waldorf salad, but in the highest degree possible. Grapes, walnuts, candied walnuts, gorgonzola cheese, all mixed together in a perfect dressing. Yum yum yum yum yum x129892385. * Spinach Artichoke Dip (4/5) Soooo good! Nobody can go wrong with spinach artichoke dip. This comes with chips, and the dip just melts in your mouth. Highly recommended for big parties only, though. Because this appetizer can be quite filling. * California Club (4/5) Greens, avocado, bacon and tomatoes. Yumms! Someone in my party always ends up getting this. I love everything about this pizza except maybe the mayo dressing. It's just too heavy for me.  * Thai Chicken (3/5) This was pretty tasty. This is an unexpected pizza flavor, but it was not unexpected for me to like it because I love Thai food and I love pizza. However, I will not be getting this pizza again because it was just too salty for me. I love CPK.

An extraordinary set of circumstance existed that allowed us to order anything we wanted. We had no limits!  So needless to say, the drinks were flowing. Wine, whiskey, and beer populated our table like a Chinese subway station. We ordered a variety of appetizers to include Spinach Dip, Avocado Eggrolls, and more. Sadly, our server forgot to put our order in and we didn't see those appetizers until most of our entrees were digested. He was very apologetic and we could tell it was a one-time thing. Plus, we had him so busy with drink orders that it was completely understandable. Don't worry about it Juan, you're still our boy!  Our entrees included an assortment of CPK's best to include the halibut, the ribeye, a couple salads, and some pizzas. I ordered the Meat Cravers Pizza myself. The thin crusted pizza had more meat than the Spearmint Rhino on a Friday night. What stood out was the Capicola Ham. The salty ham coupled with the spicy Italian Sausage really gelled well together. This is by far my favorite pizza at CPK. I did however have a bite of the Ribeye. Even though this was a pizza based restaurant, they offer a mean steak.  Not only was the presentation worthy of a steak house, the meat was seasoned with fresh garlic that's help solidify a nicely executed meal.  Al though CPK is more of a ""cookie cutter"" restaurant, it's a solid choice for any occasion. We really challenged them during this meal with constant drink orders, appetizers, entrée quality and presentation, and punctuality. Not to mention, our service was enthusiastic and friendly. Juan made a mistake missing the appetizers but when he caught it, he was on it like a flies on sh*t. I enjoyed myself.

The Not-So-Good: There was a ridiculous wait to order despite the restaurant being half empty.  Then it took forever to get our drinks, which I thought was ridiculous considering how little time it takes to make a drink.  I would think that restaurants would operate the way casinos do--get them drunk so they will spend.   The food could have been good, but we each ordered dishes with shrimp in them and the shrimp were terribly overcooked.  Shrimp is one of those foods that just tastes terrible if it has been sitting on a hot plate too long.

There is a party of 6 that got their food while my party of three is still waiting.  Updated based on the whole experience:  My food finally came an hour after waiting patiently. The only bad part is, everyones food was correct except for mine. I even pointed at what I wanted to the server, and she got my order wrong. After telling her that I didn't order this, I also told her that I didn't want it so she can take it off my bill. She apologized, but she kept asking me if I was sure..we were going back and forth for almost three minutes.

I had an absolutely horrible experience at the Redondo Beach CPK last night and was beyond disappointed with the service and food. I had not visited CPK in a very long time and was looking forward to one of your classic pizzas I used to love. After I placed my order it took their SLOW staff 30 minuets plus to bring what I had ordered. When they brought my pizza they clearly made a mistake and tried to cover up the fact that they FORGOT the sauce and proceeded to add a heaping amount of raw vegetables and splashed of sauce on the already cooked pizza.

My ""little brother"" had the BBQ Chicken Pizza, which was about a 12"" pizza topped with a generous portion of chicken and BBQ sauce.  He really enjoyed it. My table mate ordered the Thai Noodles with Shrimp.  HOLY SMOKES!  This was the winner dish of the table.  There was spaghetti noodles with red chili peppers, shrimp, and veggies.  The base sauce is a peanut sauce.  The dish was spicy, savory, and delightful!   I just wished it was my dish instead!  hah!

I'm thinking...ok that's fine but why did you take my order in the first place? Call#2 I've arrived and Im curbside so I call to let them know. Only to have my order taken again because they lost my order and nothing is ready. This is the third time I hear about the new avocado egg rolls and if I want them added to my order.

Yes I got the salad. Yes is was frustrating. Get it together CPK!  Would I go through this again to get the Thai chicken salad of my dreams?

We came in on a Thursday night for dinner. It wasn't very busy so my parents and I were promptly seated.  We ordered The Works pizza and chicken lettuce wraps. The pizza was okay, not a very big fan of it :( There was nothing special about it. I thought the chicken lettuce wraps were good though! The sauce they serve it with is a bit salty though... especially if you use too much. I was afraid that I would run out of chicken before lettuce cups so I tried to ration the 2. However, I ended up with more chicken than lettuce cups LOL. I'm not complaining though! The servers were all really nice. However, the service was really slow.

170,Jordan C.,"Hawthorne, CA",0,11,,1.0,2015-08-18,"Today myself and my colleague stopped by this CPK location for lunch and we were not satisfied with the service we received. We were seated at 12:24pm and did not receive our food until well after 1:10pm. I understand the kitchen can get backed up BUT when you notice someone that has came in AFTER you receiving there food, that's when it becomes an issue!  We ordered lunch specials (in which are small meals) and the couple that came in AFTER us but was served BEFORE us ordered full entrées. This couple came in about 15 mins after us and ordered after the waitress took our orders. (I know because our table was right behind there's) This couple received there food at least 10mins before we did. We were literally sitting there watching them eat. The waitress came over to tell us she was sorry for the long wait due to a large party in which I didn't understand what the large party had to do with us! And furthermore if we had to wait for our orders how come the couple that came in AFTER us had received there food? The majority of customers were caucasian and we, myself African American and my colleague Hispanic felt we pushed aside and had to deal with it. It had gotten to the point I asked for a manager and right before he came our food was brought out. I told him that was ok; however he and the waitress knew I was VERY upset. My pizza wasn't freshly hot (not sure if it was just sitting back there). At this point I was over it. We asked for our checks.. On my bill I saw a credit for $10 as if I was there by myself. He (my colleague) was there too experiencing this with me. Why was I only credited $10 and he not be entitled the same?  There was 2 other African American women across from us that had been waiting for sometime and they were there when we were being seated. You start to wonder when everyone caucasian around you are being served and attended to in a timely matter and you/others of different races aren't.  I absolutely love CPK and I often visit the location in Downtown LA near our office, we never had a problem.. They treat there customers so nice. We were in the area and stopped by and this location was beyond me. I didn't like the feeling of feeling like we had to just deal with it.

I have to say it makes a big difference when you know there is someone that is running a restaurant that CARES  if you are totally satisfied. In my experience if anything may not totally satisfy u like Luke warm appetizers. Jessica completely took it off our bill and brought out a fresh hot plate of food on the house.

Then another lady that also looks like manager asks if she can ""borrow"" the balsamic, which she never brought back but whatever. We finally get the bites and they look either burnt or sitting under the heat lamp too long.. it's just 4 bites on top of cheese sauce.. nothing exciting. No one came to ask if we needed anything else, like cheese and pepper since three of us got pizza. And our server only came once to refill our water which had been empty for some time now.

All I know is is this.... - an order for food was not entered correctly   - Juan obviously alerted no one on ""to go duty""  when I called to let them know I was ready for my food to be brought out - No solution was presented by the manager until it was too late So I gave the manager a quick roll call of the things I thought where Bull^%$ and drove off...right before I started to roll my window up.....she said my food could be ready in 10 minutes...too bad that was not  the case when I let Juan know I had arrived to pick up food... The manager while a nice girl and who seemed somewhat sympathetic to my position offered no real solutions...had she just come outside...admitted her staff made mistakes and that my food would be out there in less than 10 minutes and she was comping one of the dishes etc....I would have been ok...but the lack of ability to take responsibility for her incompetent staff and the BULL$&^* "" call center"" CPK has...leaves me no choice but to stop patronizing the entire chain and anytime CPK is brought up in conversation I'll share my story and encourage people to find a better restaurant to eat at. ...

To start off, I never like to name any server's name out in public, but Jesus was down right awful. Although we were seated immediately and our order was taken pretty quickly, the wait time for the food, especially appetizers, was pitiful.  We ordered the chips with avocado, a Bianco flatbread, and the chopped bbq chicken salad. The appetizer never even arrived. It took more than 30 minutes into our meal when we began to wonder if the appetizer was ever ordered by Jesus to begin with. We flagged down Jesus, who insisted that he placed the order, never once remedying our impatience but rather being insistent that he placed the order correctly.  When the stupid flatbread finally arrived it was disgustingly wet, drenched in oil, and overly salty. Our glasses of water sat empty the entire time. Once again we flagged Jesus to fill our waters please! Come check time, they were quick to drop us off our bill. We patiently sat and waited for someone to collect our money and no one came. I got up and stood next to the cash register while server after server after server carelessly walked past me without ever asking if I needed help. Mind you, it was 10pm and each and every one of them were too focused on drying the cups, wiping down the tables and silverware to make sure that they can leave on time. But hey, what about me?! I'm the customer here. Finally, the manager sees me and I wave for her to come and cash me out. She walks over and while apologetic, offered no remediation. I pretty much lost all respect for this establishment after tonight's debacle. What a shit poor place CPK has turned into.  You can't even get an appetizer out on time. You bring out my entree first and when I'm just about ready to cancel my appetizer, you magically make it appear! You can't fill my empty water cup.

Walked in and left our names with the hostess who told us it would be about a 15 minute wait. She was seating others that were ahead of us and at the same time others were walking in leaving their name. A family who left their names after us all of a sudden I notice the hostess called her over and sat the family down. Then the hostess decided to take us to a booth that was in the back and on our way i saw so many other available booths that were not being used. So fine, we sat down and it took almost 10 minutes for someone to finally ask us if we wanted drinks. Ordered the drinks and food since we didnt want to wait another long time to get them to come back and take our order. Food was good just the service was a bit slow and off. It wasnt so busy that people were running around just an off day maybe ? The waiters I notice tried to make up for the lack of service by being extra friendly.

This is the second time I have dined here with my family and the service has been subpar. We came for lunch with my kids and my friend and her kids midweek. The place was not crowded at all. Our waitress took forever to come around and then we placed the children's orders first. Granted, we asked a couple of questions and took about 5-10 mins longer to order the adult menus, but the kids food came out, was all eaten and we were still waiting for our food more than 20 minutes later. We were never able to track down our waitress. Three times my friend had to get up and go to the hostess table to try and find someone to help us when we needed another drink or extra plates and utensils. That is unacceptable. Finally, the kids had finished their food and were starting to act up when I got really upset and worried about their safety and other customers experiences so I asked for our food to be wrapped up to go. You would think at that point that they would rush to help us get our food to go and apologize or maybe offer to try to help us in some way. But you would be wrong. It still took another 10 minutes for our food to be wrapped up to go. Mind you we did not order pizza - simply two salads (which I'm sure is bulk prepared in advance), chicken potstickers (which are clearly nuked up from frozen), and a soup (probably in large pots in the back). No pizzas that would take time to be prepared in their oven. There was just no reason it should have taken so long. Plus when I complained to our waitress she gave me attitude instead of apologizing.

The real strong point is the wonderful chewy free bread appetizer, and especially the wonderful olive oil dip that comes with it -- it is amazing.  If you ever wondered what to do with the thick pizza crust left in your hand after you eat the part with the toppings, just dip it in that olive oil, yum!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-redondo-beach?start=20,3.08,3.19,3.19,2.48,3.146

If I'm in the mood for something heavier I order the garlic cream fettuccini with chicken and mushrooms.  The chicken and mushrooms are an extra fee and FYI sometimes they don't put enough for the amount you pay. But I will say it always comes out very delicious.  If I want something lighter, I order the zucchini and shrimp pasta (off their light menu).  The zucchini is is cut into strips similar to pasta so you end up with lots of zucchini and a little pasta. Also super yummy!  But my fave thing here is their Tuscan hummus with traditional pita... Not healthy my any stretch of the imagination, but it's so freaking addicting. :-/. The only thing I had a little issue with recently was that I called at 9:05pm to put in a take out order (they close at 10pm) and they basically told me they couldn't take a phone order. How weird is that?! So the employee said ""you can come in to make a to-go order""... Not exactly sure how that is any different than taking the order over to phone to save me time...

We got free bread while waiting. It was warm and the dipping sauce is olive oil with seasoning. We ordered artichoke dip appetizer. It was delicious! You must try! Tortilla with warm dipping sauce!  My friends got pasta and I got pizza. The pasta came in a large plate which was not necessary. The portion is average portion but plate was huge! Too huge! My pizza was big and really filling. I ordered the wild mushroom pizza. It was about 9-10inches in diameter. It was really delicious however the bread/crust lacked oil.

But there are two things that will get me in here right away.  Tonight I strayed from my favorite pizzas and had the seasonal offering Wild Mushroom Strozzapreti. It was beautiful and flavorful (in a nutty and meaty sort of way). Just the right amount of sauce and an abundance of mushrooms!  I can't wait to get that again soon!   The other thing I hope to return to try was a server recommendation. She said the buffalo roasted cauliflower was amazing! I love buffalo anything AND roasted cauliflower!  Be in soon! For those with kids - they have good size portions for those of us with kids about to age out of the special menu!  My tween couldn't even finish her meal! The meat sauce fusilli had a mild but flavorful tomato sauce on it. It nicely accented the meat in the sauce without overbearing it.

As we were eating the waitress NEVER came back to check on us. By this time, I was irritated. We had finished our drinks, we didn't get a refill, it was like she was avoiding us for some reason.

The personal sized pizzas are way overpriced ($16) and extremely disappointing. We got ""the works"" and it was just 3 pieces of pepperoni, 3 sausage pieces, too much bell pepper and mushrooms. The veggies on it were thrown on top raw and not seasoned nor cooked. The pizza took 20 minutes. It had no sauce whatsoever too. I mean I lifted up the choose and there was no red sauce anywhere. I literally thought we were given a frozen pizza. It was an extremely thin crust pizza but they had a selection of thin crust pizza which I imagine are paper thin because they couldn't have got any thinner than the original.  The pizza here is way over priced, thrown together worse than anything I've seen in regards to pizza, had no sauce, and took too long for what equaled a frozen pizza.   The waiter came to fill our glasses of water once over the 40 minutes we were there. That wasn't cool. The menu overall was way overpriced and I wouldn't advise anyone to come to CPK. This chain needs to learn how to make real pizzas that have sauce and at least cook the mushrooms with the pizza, not putting them on raw. Finally the pizza should cost you $5 at max. I'm extremely disappointed in this place, it just doesn't get worse than expecting a decent pizza to receiving a pizza put together by ""chefs"" who must not have any culinary skills.

Considering the salad was $16, I would have expected that it be more substantial and flavorful. When the pizza did arrive, it had a nice crust but the toppings were skimpy. Each piece had about 1 small piece of chicken. The only thing that was plentiful was the onions of all things. I would have expected more toppings for $15.  I should have known that something was up when I arrived at prime lunch time on the weekend and there was no wait.

I dont know if the food is the same at every location, or if it was just here in Hawthorne. First of all, the service was horrible. We had a young server with blonde hair who seemed to hate her job (or maybe just my family and I). She seemed annoyed when I asked her the ingredients in a pizza. I had to ask her twice because I couldn't understand what she was saying. Second, we waited about an hour before we got our dinner. We would have left, but my children, husband and I were very hungry and we didn't have extra time since we had movie tickets and the movie was close to starting. When we finally got our dinner it was COLD!!!! Yes! It must have been sitting there for a while before they brought it to us. My husband's pizza was hard, my kids had to rip the pieces off their pizza and my pasta was cold and tasteless. Horrible food!

199,Lisa J.,"Long Beach, CA",0,79,21.0,1.0,2017-10-12,"I visited this location 4 days ago and was very disappointed with the service.  I believe that the server was named Jessica but I'm not 100% certain.  (She was a curvy Caucasian girl with a nose ring and brown hair.). I unexpectedly ran into a friend of mine and we walked here for lunch.  My friend is on a special diet and therefore had a lot of questions about the items on the menu.  And yes I do admit that she asked questions but when you have dietary restrictions you have to make sure you don't eat anything that will make you sick.  There isn't a lot of fresh food items here and also not many organic/vegetarian/vegan options on the menu so you essentially have to pick something and figure out what to tell the cook to take off.  You could tell that when my friend started asking questions our server got annoyed and didn't want to answer.  We ordered wine and the wine glass on the table so we asked for a replacement which she literally just came and left on the table without even saying here you go or making eye contact, she just had a total attitude.  I had to ask about four times for bread which finally came out at the same time as our food.  My companion ordered a bowl and when we received the order it was incorrect.  She asked for no meat and it had meat.  She asked for extra cilantro and it had no cilantro at all.  When she asked the waitress if the bowl had cilantro she just shook her head yes without even checking.  Eventually our server just stopped coming to our table.  I ended up asking other servers to refill our drinks and bring the cilantro that was missing.  Bottom line is that if you work in customer service you are expected to provide good service and not show if you're having a bad day, etc.  I'm not sure if my friend left a tip but I did not as I don't tip for poor service & someone who just stops coming to the table because they've decided they don't want to be bothered with you anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-redondo-beach?start=40,2.04,2.56,2.56,,2.3520000000000003

I think it is great for lunch and the prices for the portions work out. NOW, I come specifically for the mango iced tea, spinach dip, lunch salads and pizza.. service is not much of a wager because the menu is fresh, trendy and satisfying. I have had three terrible experiences; two in the last two months at this location in the Southbay galleria.. and another last week at their HB location in Bella Terra. A combination of me being lazy and me not wanting to be negative, I chose not to review my suck-ass terrible experiences. HOWEVER, today was ridiculous. It always fascinates me how managers and employees in a restaurant can be standing around and not showing a sense of urgency you when I am waiting 30+ minutes for an appetizer.. I just omg get that. And I truly feel that the management team and servers are clueless in recognizing that patrons are annoyed and not enjoying their dining experience. Today arrived at this restaurant right at opening at 11 AM and promptly ordered our appetizers. We ordered the buffalo cauliflower and spicy Asian pepper appetizer.. We received your appetizers at 11:31!!!!! The cauliflower was icebox cold. WTH!? Then, we sat there waiting for refills the entire 30 minutes we waited for our apps..no joke. Then 11:46 AM, still waiting for our actual lunch. This is the slowest service EVER experienced and no acknowledgement of it, no manager to even tell. Our server stopped by finally with refills and asked how everything was tasting but as I was beginning to respond she continued walking, LOL. Anyway. Check was dropped-off before I could order the pumpkin cheesecake. I really like this place but it has gone down hill in the last year.. i've been coming here and MB location for 15 years plus. It could do so much better if people actually put their heart into the service.

I usually just go straight to the to-go area (forget the curbside, if you're in a rush. I haven't tried it and probably wouldn't ever.) I have to say I've encountered 2 different day managers there throughout my visits and they are always friendly and willing to help, which they do. Today there was a long line of to-go orders and I was in and out of there within 5-7 minutes with the help of the lady manager. I could tell she was busy but was still upbeat and nice.  In other visits, the waitress who checks me out asks if I want bread and oil which is great! Another visit, the guy manager, super friendly, asked if I wanted a complimentary drink, I didn't take it since I already had one in the car but just those little touches makes my visits here more enjoyable.
