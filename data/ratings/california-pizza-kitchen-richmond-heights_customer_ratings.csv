32,Patt C.,"Chesterfield, MO",245,945,,4.0,2012-02-04,"The office ordered in for a working lunch yesterday. We used 569 Dine, which works based on the ZIP code of your delivery destination. The website shows all ZIP codes served, including the restaurants participating in delivery to each ZIP code. There is a $10 food minimum and a $5.50 delivery charge. If your order is more than $30, they automatically add a 10% gratuity. We were ordering for 5. Everybody thoroughly enjoyed their food. There was Sedona Tortilla Soup (and the tortilla strips were courteously in a separate container), Korean barbeque steak tacos, asparagus and spinach spaghettini (whole wheat) and Margherita pizza. I got the Wedge Salad. And tortilla spring rolls, two for $7.29. You could get 3 for $10.29. This is listed as an appetizer, so I thought a salad to go with it would work well. Tortilla spring rolls: I chose the Baja Chicken (diced chicken, Jack and Cheddar cheeses, black beans, mild chilies, red onions and cilantro with guac on the side) and the Mediterranean (grilled Portobello, eggplant, sun-dried tomatoes, caramelized onions, Fontina, Mozzarella and Parmesan with sun-dried tomato marinara on the side). The flour tortillas were all herbed up. Delicious and crunchy (even through the packing and delivery time). Two spring rolls. How much food can that be? It was six or eight three-bite pieces. Huge. Filling. Delicious. Why is this an appetizer? The Wedge will wait for another day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-richmond-heights?start=20,3.088,3.088,3.088,3.088,3.088
43,Mona H.,"Redwood City, CA",51,151,174.0,2.0,2012-05-19,"I didn't come here with Mallory W with the idea they would have superb pizza. I already know cpk is pretty generic, so I can't expect too much. I did expect good service, but we didn't even get that.  It felt like our waiter was seriously on his first day there because he was clumsy, and forgetful, among other things. He brought out my appetizer salad with my meal, which I hate! I should never have to ask someone when my appetizer is coming out, but these days I feel like I'm being forced to because of epically bad service everywhere. Anyway, our food was as expected, good, but not orgasmic. The kicker of it all was when he brought our checks and I couldn't find my credit card. Our waiter disappeared into thin air, so I was left to find it on my own.  I found out he dropped it by the register.  That was the last straw. He got a terrible tip from us both and I will most likely never return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-richmond-heights?start=40,2.9200000000000004,2.9200000000000004,2.9200000000000004,2.9200000000000004,2.9200000000000004

He suggested the avocado spring rolls.  That guy KNEW what was up. My boyfriend and I ate those up before our food came which screwed up our appetite. :) But that is what to-go boxes are for! The next visit, the waitress was prompt and gave great service too. Our food came out in about ten-fifteen minutes. Not a long wait at all! And it was very busy when we were there. That's talent! This time I had the avocado spring rolls as my meal and my boyfriend had the jerk chicken pizza. His pizza was very juicy and I recognized that it tasted good but it's not the sort of flavour I clamor for. ;) He did beg me to share my avocado spring rolls.

49,Anita K.,"Saint Louis, MO",43,164,,2.0,2013-01-15,"The changes here over the years have not been for the better.  The decor is industrial and cold.  The tables look as though they tried to shove as many seats in as possible.  It was so haphazard, we had to walk a circuitous route in several directions just to get to our table.  They have wine glasses that they leave on the table for the duration of the meal- lunch in this case.  Don't think CPK is that type of place, especially for lunch.  It took ten minutes for a waiter to say hello, another ten for our beers and to place our order, and another forty five for the pizza to arrive.  When it did, I had to get the bill and a couple of boxes so we could make it to the movie we wanted to see at the Galleria Cinema, luckily just right down the hall.  All this and it wasn't very crowded.   The menu has changed as well- the prices are higher, many of their bests salads and dressings are gone.  They also try to upsell every pizza.  I asked if the Habanero Carnitas had cheese on it...it doesn't but they can add some for a charge.  Hmmm...not really going to pay for cheese on my pizza, something I consider a standard ingredient even on a gourmet pizza.  So I asked for the traditional BBQ chicken and was asked if I wanted to add bacon.  Ummm, no thanks, again!  Bacon, although delicious, doesn't even sound that great on a BBQ chicken pizza.  And that's saying something!   I wound up having to sneak my pizza in to the movie since they don't want outside food in the theaters.  Obviously by this point I was starving but was not going to buy something else when I had a whole pizza!  Luckily it wasn't too hard to sneak in and it was easy to eat watching the movie.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-richmond-heights?start=40,3.0160000000000005,3.0160000000000005,3.0160000000000005,3.0160000000000005,3.016000000000001
27,Stacey T.,"Saint Louis, MO",243,288,115.0,3.0,2013-03-30,"While interviewing with a restaurant owner, he admitted that this chain was his favorite in St. Louis. I found that really, really hard to believe. I mean, there are some really great restaurants in St. Louis... Or, at least, so I hear.  Anyways, once said owner planted this seed in my head, I couldn't get pizza out of my head. I was taking part in some retail therapy and suggested we check out the ""fresh"" ingredients he told me about. The staff was friendly, really friendly. From the hostess, who basically let us pick our own table, to the honest and knowledgeable server, who took excellent care of us. Everyone was sunshine, puppy dogs and rainbows.  My date had two mini-appetizers, one was a dip of some sort (shows how memorable it was...) and the other was quesadillas. Neither were worth whatever she paid for them. Admittedly, the guacamole was fresh and chunky but the portion was really, really small. Smaller than tapas small. The quesadilla was just a joke. It was extra skinny and sad.... I, on the other hand, was hungry. I ordered a small starter salad. It was really great- loaded with candied nuts and the dressing was perfect. I also ordered a pizza to share. It was the special of the day (week? month?)... brussel sprouts, goat cheese and bacon! It sounded weird, but was, indeed tasty. The downfalls were that the bottom of my pizza was blackened, not burnt, but charred with way too many grill marks. I get it. A wood-fired pizza oven, or whatever, but I still don't need the taste of char to over power my entire pizza. What a disappointment. Furthermore, the pizza combination itself would have been far more balanced with a nice layer of olive oil (since there was no marinara), as goat cheese alone is very dry. I was inspired by the experience and intend to recreate the salad and the pizza at home.  All in all, customer service, however attentive and nice, is not enough to make me spend my hard earned cash. Three stars for trying.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-richmond-heights?start=20,3.1800000000000006,3.1800000000000006,3.1800000000000006,3.1800000000000006,3.1800000000000006

Friends and I decided to come here to have dinner on a early Friday evening. Place wasn't very crowded, we were here around 6pm.  We didn't order pizza this time, I think we've tried all the pizza on the menu already. We decided to go with pastas.  They now offer complimentary bread with olive oil and herbs. Bread could be warmer, it was crusty outside and soft inside, loved the olive oil.  I ordered the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine - I really liked the hint of jalapenos lime sauce, not really spicy. Skimpy on the chicken.  Kung Pao Spaghetti with Chicken - took a bite from my friend's plate, didn't really like it.

Anyway, we ordered the waldorf CHICKEN salad and the hawaiian bbq chicken pizza. i liked how the waiter asked us if we wanted the salad first or everything together-- they're supposed to ask but i think they always forget. Everything was amazingg except for the fact that they forgot to put chicken in the chicken salad lol lol... we let the waiter know and the manager came over and very kindly offered his apologies and let us have the salad for free, which despite being chicken-less, was still very, very tasty and i would definitely recommend it! the pizza was delicious and we asked for ranch, i think they charge 50 cents for that. all in all, we had a great experience!  i am also pleased that the hawaiian pizza is a chicken pizza since anything with pineapple or named hawaiian usually comes with ham.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-richmond-heights?start=40,3.2800000000000002,3.2800000000000002,3.2800000000000002,3.2800000000000002,3.2800000000000007

We had the super spinach + Quinoa salad features tender spinach, cranberries, crisp Granny Smith apples and spiced pecans.

Like, a lot of bread, which made me a happy camper. The pizzas are very expensive, but they're the only very good thing on the menu, imo. I got the corn chips and guac, which was all right, and a salad. However, there are little to no vegetarian options here. I was disappointed.

We decided to do the half and half (I think they called it the duo).  We each got half of a salad (me a Caesar, him a super spinach + quinoa).  We both decided on the oven roasted turkey with brie sandwich.  Both our salads were good but each of us agreed that we could have used just a bit more dressing.  The sandwich was delicious but I agreed with our waitress who said she thought it would be better if it had cranberry chutney on it.  All in all, it was a good lunch and fueled us for the rest of our day.

California Pizza Kitchen does not offer a happy hour, although they have a pretty large selection of cocktails ($9.99). I had a Moscow Mule (pretty classic right?), I thought it was too sweet. My friend had a ginger strawberry cocktail, too sweet as well.  We ordered a plate of 3 Tortilla Spring Rolls. I thought the spring rolls, the waitress described us bigger portion but it was way smaller. You have the choice to mix different rolls, so we ordered one of each : Mediterranean Veggie (mushrooms, eggplant, sun-dried tomatoes, caramelized onions, Mozzarella and Parmesan and marinara sauce on the side), Baja Chicken (with Monterey Jack cheese,  Cheddar, corn, black beans, poblanos, red onions and cilantro, with housemade guacamole on the side) and Thai Chicken (with Peanut sauce, bean sprouts, scallions, carrots, cilantro and Mozzarella and Peanut sauce on the side). Those rolls were tasty, I liked the Thai chicken one the most. I may try their pizza next time if I'm around.

Hand tossed BBQ Chicken original with bacon and a Cali. Veggie with goat cheese. The Brussels & Bacon flatbread was another hit amongst my dining partners.  CPK also has a kids menu which doubles as a coloring book, equipped with 3 crayons to occupy the kiddos while the adults converse.  Plenty of dining both indoors and out, a full bar, herb garden display upon entry and hosts stationed to greet you at arrival.

It was all delicious. Athough at times during my meal, I wanted something and the bartender (my server) had disappeared, the service still wasn't bad. There were also large TVs throughout the bar and dining room which nice to watch while dining. Getting back to the service though, I inquired about CPK's reward program. I handed the Bartender my filled out card to get me started and he mis-entered my phone number into the system when setting my account up. Teh way that you're found in teh system is by phone number so as of now, when I'm asked for my phone number, they won't be able to find me in the system. Thanks a lot sir.....

I ordered ahead and the food was prepared in the time that was given to me, which is always a plus. Downside, is their curbside service to go. When you pull up to the parking spot, you have to call a number. Debatable if it is an actual St. Louis number. When I called, the person on the other line seemed confused. I waited for a few minutes and no one came out. I finally had to go in to retrieve my order. I was in a hurry, which is why I thought he curbside would have been convenient. It's not the worst thing in the world, but just put a small dent in my plans since I was really on the go.

First the positives: While It may be called California PIZZA Kitchen do Not be confused, While CPK has some tasty Pizzas (Which I always considered non traditional wood fired pizzas with very different ingredients) *Their Salads and Pastas are top notch! The Chinese Chicken salad,and The *Seasonal Strawberry Fields salad (See Pic!)  Pasta: CPKs  1.)Fettuccine (Your choice of protein) =Nice garlic cream sauce. One of the best Fettuccines around! 2.) Kung Pow Spaghetti (a personal fave!)  chicken, green onions,cayenne in a flavorful peanut sauce (I personally have them hold the actual peanut topping) .... You may be apprehensive to try this the first time but IMO it is amazing and waitress said they sell a Lot of it! Secret to the Pasta Dishes?= Perfectly al dente pasta!! CPK gets points for adding new and diverse menu items over the past few years.

The appetizer we got was buffalo cauliflower something... it could have been chicken, the texture was great! The sauce is spicy but not too spicy and the bleu cheese really complimented it. I was skeptical about the cauliflower but now I'm going to try more cauliflower as a substitute type foods. And obviously the pizza was very good, crispy and flavorful.

2,Max H.,"Saint Louis, MO",446,12,42.0,1.0,2017-07-31,"Very disappointed.  It was my sisters birthday, and our family gathered for what was supposed to be a nice dinner. It took almost 10 minutes for anyone to come to our table to get our drinks. Or even say ""I'll be right with you"" she just looked at us. Meanwhile, she is standing and talking to another table.  That was the first thing that put me off. Jacky was her name. Before she brings out drinks, she greets another table and brings their drinks and bread. We get our drinks, no bread. We had to ASK for it.  Another 10-15 minutes goes by, doesn't offer appetizers, and we had to flag her to get our order. I was very pressed for time, and didn't appreciate being made to wait 25 minutes just to get bread and something to drink.  I was able to put in my order with appetizers, and she did bring out my meal first. However, I had to ask for a box THREE times, between the second and third, she boxed up ANOTHER TABLES food (the one that got their after us, and she clearly felt deserved more attention) My sister, finally said something. As well as a few of the people I was with. It was just embarrassing that we recommended this place, and she had to talk to the Waitress Jacky not once, but THREE TIMES!  It's VERY rare that I don't tip. I OVER tip because I've been a server and been there! But there was ZERO excuse for the way she treated us-they weren't busy, it's a Monday night.  When we spoke to a manager, she simply made excuses for the server.  I am very unhappy about my experience here today, and not sure if I will return. It's a shame because I Loooooove the Jambalaya!

The first time he arrived at our table he wanted to take our food order.  I politely told him that we were not ready but we would like to order our beverages at which point he rolled his eyes!  We never were offered refills on our drinks until we flagged him down.  When I requested more bread and oil for my Mother-in-Law to accompany her salad he acted annoyed.  When he brought it he slammed it down on the edge of our table and didn't even take the empty plate!  My 89 year old MIL was so upset.  We got the message loud and clear from him that he was not happy to be waiting on a group of women....well we always tip 20 percent and after he got his tip and we were done eating and just chatting he could not have been nicer....refilling water and ice tea!!!!!  We spent a lot of money to be disrespected by this twerp!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-richmond-heights,3.64,3.64,3.64,,3.6400000000000006

After several minutes a woman looked up and stared expectedly, as if daring me to speak first.  ""Two?"", she finally asked. ""Yes."" I said smiling. And then with no further instruction we stood there for another five minutes while her and the other employees planned their heist to break into the Capitol to steal the Declaration of Independence. Or rather, discuss further the table situation, with exasperated looks on all their faces as if two human beings weren't standing before them. A different woman eventually sat us, and as I looked around I noticed stacks of dirty dishes sitting on the condiment table behind us. They were there the WHOLE time. So many employees walked by. Yet the dishes remained... We were brought our appetizer and give two plates, both dirty. One with an actual piece of food the size of my palm smashed on to it. Perhaps bread? Maybe not.

The warm bread she brought to the table was baked to perfection. We started with the buffalo cauliflower. Basically baked cauliflower coated with a spicy buffalo sauce, blue cheese and green onions. It was actually amazing. My BBQ chicken salad was huge (full size), I splurged and added avocado which was a nice addition. It also included jicama, which is hard to come by at most restaurants. All in all was a great salad, although pricey coming in at just under $20. But can you really put a price on a good salad?!? My husband ordered the shrimp and garlic pizza. The crust is their signature thin crust pizza. It was good, but was a little dry and suffered from too much cheese (yes, you can have too much cheese).
