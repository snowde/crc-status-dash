The service was superior.  Desserts were great.  Drinks were fine.  Price has become reasonable and they now have a smaller appetite menu that's great and right on the money. They also have provided more bread with the humus and you can order extra for $1. Plus, the place is spotless, including the restrooms.   The reason for 3 stars instead of 4 or 5 is that they have not gotten with the idea of putting calories next to each item.

It wasent even busy in there, and i did not get  asked once if i wanted some more pepsi.I  even asked for hot sauce and they never brought it to me , untill i asked another waiter. I was better off a cheesecake factory for the price of the noodle dish. i also felt lke i was being rushed out of there because we had at least 2 people come to our table telling us which door to use  when we  were ready leave.

However, good service can't make up for bland food. Best dish of the night was the miso shrimp salad. Generous portions of shrimp, a light dressing, and crispy wonton strips made for a surprisingly good salad. The two other items I tried were simply ""meh."" The Jambalaya pasta was decent and had a nice spicy kick to it, but was actually pretty one note. Not terrible, just not outstanding. The pesto chicken pizza was just extremely dry.

The interior is rather chic with an illuminated bar and friendly servers, and my particular waiter was both helpful and knowledgeable. When I asked for a crisp Pinot Grigio, he suggested an excellent Estancia, which was exactly what I was hoping for.  Having won me over with wine, I asked his recommendation on pizza, and ended up getting the Carnitas Habanero, which was tender and tasty but hot! I could barely use half a spoonful on each slice without needing copious refills on my water glass. For dessert, we had the lemon cake which surprised me by being tasty but not overpowering. I'm wary of overly sweet frosting, but this cake was just the right balance of sweet and fluffy.

Creative toppings trump simplicity and pure love and skill poured into making a crust. On my most recent trip I settled on splitting a grilled veggie salad (I actually think the salads are better than the pizzas here) and a mushroom pizza. We made the call to add red sauce to our pizza and I was impressed of being offered an option of a few different kinds. We opted for the spicy and I have to say the pie turned out pretty good as well.

CPK has a new menu of apps around $3, which is pretty nifty. Ours was forgotten, so we got it on the house. The food wasn't something I'd crave or really want to come back for, but it was good. The jerk chicken pizza pulled off the spicy/sweet combo in an unusual way. I actually liked the salad the best, even though it was so simple.  I don't usually go to CPK to get slizzard.... it's usually for a work lunch for family thing, so I didn't notice how CHEAP wines by the glass were! There wasn't much over $6! I took advantage and had two. My mom was there, after all. Wine and beer selection is a little lacking, but it's cheap.

To be honest, I think I would have been more satisfied with Costco or little ceasars. I am not sure if I would be coming back here... Paid $15 for poor pizza. Even the free bread and oil was bland. i wish they had more seasoning in the oil. It just seemed to me like just plain olive oil.

Sat down, our server, Ricky took my order, and everything went as usual.  I asked Ricky for a basket of bread. After waiting for a while, I felt like he forgot. So I tried to catch someone's attention to remind him. But everyone would just pass by me like they didn't  see or hear me. And they wasn't busy at all.

Refill of water. Check and to go box. We spent more time trying to get someone to help us than eat. But there was a server named Maggie, she was amazing. Even though she was holding plates in her hands and she wasn't or server, she took the time to stop and ask what we needed. And she helped is every time.

The thai chicken pizza is good if you like that peanut sauce taste and the margarita pizza cant go wrong.

We were told we had about a 5 or 10 minute wait and only had one party in front of us. 20 minutes  and 3 parties seated later (two of which were 2 people like us, and one with 5 people- all came after us), we were sitting in the lobby and the serving staff was trying to convince us to sit on the porch in the wind and cold because they realized they had skipped us and wanted to get us seated. We werent upset because accidents happen and we had come a little earlier than we usually eat so we told them we would wait for a table inside...... and then we were ignored for another 15 minutes while other people were seated or greeted. Get to the table and they are in the middle of a remodel so its dark and disheveled around our table. The waitress tells us the bread is in the oven and will be right over to us... 10 minutes later she takes our drink order and apologizes again that we don't have any bread and says she will be right back... another 10 minutes goes by and she comes back to take our order and remembers that she forgot the bread. She takes the order and then sets off again for the bread, which we never asked for but now that we have been waiting to eat we really are looking forward to.  Drinks get dropped off and then about 15 minutes later our food arrives and our waitress again apologized about not getting the bread for us and she is sorry the food came out first. We were pleasant and never said a word about the service the whole night because we were hungry and just wanted a nice Sunday night dinner date but I couldn't believe how horrible it was. The food was great but I didn't get a refill on my drink until I asked for the check and a box.  The check arrived, the refill arrived but no box. I left the payment, I left a tip for her effort and I left my leftovers on the table. I don't think it was a very good first impression for my boyfriend and I don't think I will be back to CPK for awhile... and probably not this one if I do go.  California Pizza Kitchen is not supposed to be a run of the mill dinner option, it is supposed to be a premium pizza restaurant with outstanding service to match their quality and pricing.

When you order off of the kids menu, you already know what they like or don't. The crispy chicken wasn't horrible, but it leaned toward the drier side tonight. You can't go wrong with the pizza so that was gone. We had a friendly wait staff.

I sympathize with the staff because I know that it's not entirely their fault, nor is it our servers fault. But Jude was extremely professional and apologetic. His manager returned to our table, as well as the bartender to ensure we were completely happy. The chef even came out and brought us our dishes when they were ready.

I ordered the Moroccan chicken salad and it was absolutely amazing. Probably one of the best salads I've ever had. It had dates, eggplant, beets and a champagne vinaigrette.

208,Maribel S.,"Menifee, CA",6,24,13.0,3.0,2017-04-02,"My Reviews Preface: People have different taste buds and preferences. Some may like their food more/less salty, spicy, and seasoned, etc. Some may prefer mom-n-pops restaurants, others more fancy or both. Some prefer fresh & organic ingredients; others just want their food to taste ""good"". As far as customer service, I think that can be tricky based on people's personalities. So, I'm of the opinion that you try the place your looking to eat at & judge for yourself, unless there are horrid reviews of course. My Review: Food: ""White Corn Guacamole + Chips"" - wasn't very impressed. Had no flavor and I was expecting to be what the menu described in it's title and that is ""Guacamole"". It was more like small chunks of avocado mixed with the other ingredients. ALTHOUGH, in their defense, the menu did state diced avocado, HOWEVER, I expected it to have somewhat of a creamy consistency throughout. I wouldn't have this appetizer again.  Next, ""Chicken Tequila Fettuccine"": the pasta was not quite Al Dente, it was a hair under cooked but tolerable. At first glance, it was not an appetizing looking dish, it looked mostly ""earth toned"" and that didn't appeal to me. The taste, however, surprised me. I wasn't expecting it to taste good since I didn't like what I saw initially and it was also creamy. All the flavors described, however, did not deliver. I couldn't taste the tequila (nor was I expecting a strong flavor to come through) but I could taste a bit of the jalapeno, although it didn't hit the right spicy notes that I particularly wanted. Although it wasn't tasteless, I wouldn't try this dish again. Atmosphere: typical restaurant food chain Customer Service: Hostess was pleasant, greeted us well. Server was nice, not extremely attentive during the course of our lunch but I don;t prefer all the fuss while I eat anyway, just for my server to be available should I need anything further. Cleanliness: Adequate, at least in the eating area Price: typical price for such a restaurant $$ but I don't think the pricing was appropriate to the quality of food I received. Timing of Food: acceptable Overall: I would dine here again to try something else. Although it is a chain, I believe that our experience can vary from different restaurants due to who the cooks are and management of course.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-riverside,3.96,3.64,3.64,3.436,3.7680000000000002

It was my first time visiting Riverside Plaza so I didn't realize there was a public restroom. Nonetheless I was hoping they would be understanding at CPK and help a momma out. The older woman with dark black hair who opened the door greeted me kindly until I asked if my toddler could please use the restroom. She looked annoyed, completely changed her attitude, and told me coldly that in the future I needed to use the public restroom and pointed in some direction outside. While I sort of understand why they have these ""policies"" but I wasn't really asking for too much - a little kindness from one human to another perhaps? I wondered: if I were a man would this woman have treated me the same? If I were white?  Would it have mattered if she knew I were a doctor? None of that should matter.  I shouldn't have to show credentials (by way of skin color, gender, or degrees) to be treated with a little respect and humanity. But I am quite certain that any of those descriptors would have changed the way she responded to me. Anyway, recognizing that I was not wanted I went ahead and told her ""okay I will go find the public restroom."" When I arrived it was closed.  This was my first experience at this CPK and will likely be my last.

15,David B.,"Riverside, CA",3,9,,1.0,2017-09-04,(Written by Anita Bonner) We just left one of our favorite spots to get dinner. Not busy but they had a couple of large party's already seated. Our drink orders were taken by the hostess. As we sat at our table without service. I looked around to see who our server might be hoping they would see us in their section. I made eye contact with a chef (in a white jacket) walking by. He immediately came over to our table and asked if we'd been helped. We told him no and he took our order. During this time our server came over very apologetic stating she had a large party she was attending to. She made jokes with the chef and left to place our order. CPK like most restaurants has shared servers so we received our order from another server. I asked the server if he'd bring us extra dressing for our salads. He said yes but never returned. We started eating waiting for the salad dressing after about 7or8 minutes I went to the bar to ask for the dressing. Another server brought it to the table. By the time our server came back to our table we were nearly finished eating. I told her her that I didn't feel that she gave us the best service tonight. She asked why and I explained that she never came to the table even after she had apologized for not being attentive in the beginning of her service. I had to go to the bar and ask for the salad dressing we also needed refills. She went to get the refills and brought it back to the table. We never saw her again. Instead a manager came to the table (She was possibly sent) asked if we needed anything... I asked for our check. After we paid we explained how the service had been and shared our disappointment. Again she apologized and thank me for sharing my concerns she also offered me a $15.00 gift card. I didn't accept the gift card but I did accept the apology. We always have a choice in where we spend our hard earned dollars. Poor service is never acceptable.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-riverside?start=20,3.92,3.74,3.74,,3.8120000000000003
202,Denise F.,"Riverside, CA",0,5,1.0,4.0,2017-09-13,"It is sad that good food does not always guarantee good service.  We had a large party (12), arriving for reserved dinner at 6:30. So it's not like we weren't expected.  Unfortunately for this staff on a Wednesday evening, we apparently were too much for the cook. Credit the waiter for trying his best, but he failed to bring any information on why there was a long delay in service. None of us had our orders at 7:45. Thus, the manager was summoned.    Perhaps another cook would be beneficial in granting more stars for this particular restaurant.  That said, my Crunchy Thai salad was delicious. But not worth waiting for over an hour. Update Added 10/12/17: To my surprise, management went above and beyond to rectify the 2 star rating I initially gave this restaurant!  It's highly likely I will return soon, because they've practicality begged, haha, but in all seriousness, their menu selections really are delicious",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-riverside,3.96,3.77,3.77,,3.846

I tried their new Watermelon Mint martini, it was so refreshing and delicious.  The service at the bar was great.  One of my all time favorite dishes here is the Kung pao spaghetti. Its combining two of my favorite foods; Kung Pao chicken and Spaghetti. I always order this whether we are dining in or grabbing this to go.

207,Tiffany R.,"Riverside, CA",0,9,,1.0,2017-10-19,Every time I go to California Pizza Kitchen there seems to be a problem with the staff they are very rude and every time I order take out the food comes out wrong and I have to sit and wait another 15 minutes for my food to be ready.

195,Michelle W.,"Riverside, CA",2,23,32.0,5.0,2017-10-20,"Update on my experience: I've changed this review due to the fact the manager Brian reached out to me and I discussed the issue with him. I'm a regular at cpk and this review was based on one person. So I've edited my review to 5stars because I come here weekly and the service is always good, just not this one time.  I come to Cpk all the time. I always order the bbq chicken salad which is my favorite salad of all time. The food was great but the waitress we had needs to work on it. My daughter asked her for flavored tea so she offered to bring 2 diff syrups she can try, when she returned to the table she brought her a lemonade. She clearly was confused and not listening because we didn't order a lemonade. Then we asked her for bread as she did not automatically bring it to our table with the drinks. She again forgot that. I had to ask the waitress that ended up bringing our food to us to bring bread. Never came by our table to bring refills of my water. Then when I asked for the check and boxes for the pizza and the salad. She brings the Check with only a box for the pizza. Again not listening! Sigh. So I asked for the box again. This was the worse service I've experienced at cpk.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-riverside,3.96,3.83,3.83,,3.882

209,Angelina C.,"Mentone, CA",159,22,33.0,4.0,2017-12-10,"It's the night before Mr.GC leaves to Pittsburgh, so what does that mean... he's not even close to being ready. But thanks to me I'm showing off my grand master skills in packing. But before we do this chore, we grab a bite to eat for pick up. I tried something new in ordering. I did the online route. It was quick and easy. It gave options for date of meal, what is the time we wanted, too... the choice of curbside, pickups or delivery. We had plans to have a drink at the bar while we picked up our order. We walked in sat at the bar. Bartender asked what we would like, I told him I had placed an online order he said ok,but we would like to have a drink, he said no problem, let me get your name and check your order. He said it will be ready in a few min do you still want it to go. Mr.GC and I both said yes. I saw on the menu a new drink called Cha Cha Agua Fresca it really was refreshing. This is an alcoholic drink I might add. It had a chilly spice you could taste at the back of your throat. Mr.GC had a little sip while he enjoyed his tall blonde beer. Are meal was ready in no time, the bartender asked if there was anything else we would like extra; oils cheese,bread. We said yep, to all those things. Mr.GC's favorite meal is the tequila lime pasta w/chicken, I tried one of their new dishes. The spicy Chinese spaghetti w/ added chicken & shrimp. I have to say I was surprised on how spicy it really was; it definitely had a kick. Would totally order the drink and meal again while using the online ordering service. Made the beginning of the night run smooth knowing we had a lot to do before Mr.GC left at 4am.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-riverside,4.04,3.86,3.86,,3.9320000000000004
