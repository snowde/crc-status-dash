1,Jennifer H.,"Lake Forest, IL",2386,404,2166.0,2.0,2012-07-03,"My initial thought this place was clean. It was also a great place to sit down considering I had some time before my flight -- no rushing. Good thing. The service was definitelt spotty. The waitress forgot my salad. Then our entrees came out at different times. And this place was practically empty! What on earth would the service be like if there were actually customers? One bonus... There is a full bar and if you sit are the bar, there are TVs to zone out to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento-3,,,,,
5,J T.,"Madison, WI",4,251,15.0,2.0,2012-12-09,"it does have a full bar, and menu.  The food was ""OK"".  Prices are high for what you get even in an airport. The staff was friendly, but this isnt a top spot for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento-3,,,,,
3,Christopher C.,"Sacramento, CA",1352,722,1079.0,4.0,2013-07-12,"This location is in the food court of the Sacramento International Airport (SMF).  This small franchise is clean and has friendly staff.  The food is pretty good.  I had a breakfast sandwich with Applewood Bacon and scrambled eggs and some fancy cheese.  The bread was grilled,(that was a nice touch).  The prices are a little high because you are paying a premium for service and food inside the secure area of the airport.  Employees cost more, as they must undergo and be able to pass background checks, the operati8ng costs are higher, and the rent is very high.  All this leads to higher prices of about 40% more.  This is understandable so I don't really mind paying $10 for a breakfast sandwich should run about $7.  Plastic utensils is a wierd, but again understandble.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento-3,,,,,
0,Ryan H.,"Roseville, CA",8,37,5.0,3.0,2014-07-11,"not bad, however,  be careful of getting food for a group here. The price can spiral out of control and make your wallet take a nose dive into the grand canyon. Well maybe not that bad, but the portions vs price are a little off.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento-3,,,,,
8,Les M.,"Sacramento, CA",2,59,8.0,1.0,2014-11-09,"California Pizza Kitchen and Sacramento International Airport cannot ever get it right. I order a pizza with extra sauce and I get a pizza with no sauce. I ordered a wedge salad and they cut it and mixed it up like a stir fry. Today I ordered a pizza with extra extra sauce with an emphasis on extra pizza sauce and got no sauce but extra cheese. The waiter even showed me the order that was presented to them, yet they can't read English??? Freaking morons. If you cannot read and speak English, you shouldn't work in an American pizza restaurant. Go find a nice Chinese restaurant to work at. PLEASE and quit screwing up my $12 dollar mini pizza.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento-3,,,,,
6,Benjamin T.,"Orinda, CA",0,11,1.0,1.0,2015-08-20,"Even with the inherently low expectations of airport dining, the quality of the service here was stunning in its low quality. CPK SMF=the antidote to tipping.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento-3,,,,,
