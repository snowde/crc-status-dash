117,Kelly G.,"Sacramento, CA",31,50,25.0,4.0,2012-01-21,"We had a great experience here, I wasn't sure what to expect with a chain, I never am. Our server Brittany was fantastic, she courteously let me babble on about our horrible experience with food to you trying to get food from here about a month ago. She was just on top of everything. Just what I like when I go out. The food was above what I was expecting, I got the white pizza(could leave off the ricotta), lettuce wraps (OMG YUM) and my husband got the tortilla soup and fish tacos, which he enjoyed a lot. We even ordered more lettuce wraps to take home, the sauce was delish! One thing, as an old school server myself that drives me nuts, is if you are obviously looking around for someone and no one notices. I was looking around, just sorta looking, and the manager took note immediately, so I called him over just to say we had  had great food and service. I am happy.  The only thing I would change is the location. In our quote troubled economy unquote the mall was a ZOO (Are Americans THAT well trained to consume goods?) the parking lot was hell and impossible to maneuver. We had gone to Loehman's plaza, cause there used to be a CPK there, but it was gone.  I might order from food to you just so I don't EVER have to go near Arden mall again, but THOSE FOLKS really need to get their ___ together!

210,Corky C.,"Roseville, CA",1,118,,4.0,2012-02-01,"This is my first visit to any California Pizza Kitchen.  My friend took me here toward closing time at night, and we each ordered a pizza.   I did not know that this is how it works here, where one person orders a whole pizza, but indeed, we were each able to eat the whole pizza.  It's a light pizza with a light crust.   It's good, and the ingredients are good, so it goes down pretty quick.  I must admit that I do prefer a more traditional pizza and crust, but this was good for a change of pace.  The crust is sort of like a thick tortilla.  Service was good.  I will give it 3.5 stars and an extra .5 for the service and environment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento?start=260,3.04,3.04,3.04,3.44,3.0400000000000005
203,Curtis W.,"Sacramento, CA",0,20,,4.0,2012-02-20,"I actually don't think of CPK as a pizza place, but I like it.  Been a fan for ten+ years.  We were regulars at the Walnut Creek store when we lived there, and have been to the Arden store numerous times since moving to Arden-Arcade seven years ago. Between my wife and me, we've probably tried everything on the menu.  Do I like everything? No.  But most of it is good, and I definitely have some favorite items. For me, the Sicilian pizza is comfort food.  All meat with some zip. Comfort for the wife is the mushroom pepperoni and sausage pizza (a.k.a the ""mupsa""). If you need a traditional kind of pizza, you can rely on either of the above. The roasted pear and gorgonzola pizza is one I am glad they brought back.  If you're a pizza purist that thinks pizza can only be tomato sauce, cheese, and meat, you just won't be happy.  They took this one off the menu for a while but people like me complained.  I don't order every time I come in, but I got it once in while.  A lot of others apparently felt the same way so they brought it back. The Thai chicken and BBQ chicken pizzas are also among my favorites and are probably original menu items.  And they have several good pasta dishes.  The kung pao spaghetti is really good (though I ask for it made with fettuccine), but it isn't Chinese food, OK? The service is consistently good.  I have panned service in places based on one or two visits, and it isn't like CPK has never had an off night.  But I have been here MANY... MANY... times, and would say that on average, they are spot on with great service.  We're regulars here for a reason. None of this is to say that I won't eat at a traditional pizza place.  In fact, there are plenty of times I prefer the family owned pizza parlor close-by in Carmichael.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento?start=260,3.08,3.08,3.08,3.44,3.0800000000000005

Frankly the food at CPK isn't anything extraordinary, but this time the pizzas were done well and the service was spectacular (hence the 4 stars).

198,Carrie V.,"Sacramento, CA",3,82,5.0,5.0,2012-03-16,"Excellent lunch with the grandparents a few days ago.  I am not a huge fan of chain restaurants, but this is one place everyone can agree on so sometimes we go for pizza and salad.   I always get a salad, in the interest of fitting into my skinny jeans again one day, but I usually manage to pilfer a small slice of pizza from someone else at the table!  This time I was pleasantly rewarded.  My grandmother ordered the five cheese pizza, which comes topped with tomato slices and basil.  OMG.  This may have been the tastiest pizza I have ever had.  Tons of cheese, nice flavors.  Are we really at CPK?  Wow.  I highly recommend this pizza.  We also had a cobb salad, broccoli-artichoke soup, and (my favorite) the moroccan chicken salad, which I usually order with the dijon balsamic instead of the dressing it comes with.  I always get either the moroccan chicken or the roasted vegetable salad, and they are both dynamite.  Everything we ate that day was tasty, and the service was excellent. Our server, Jessica, was pleasant, prompt, and very patient.  The hostess, whose name I can't remember (I remember she said she was Puerto Rican and Mexican, had dark curly hair and was very kind), was enthusiastic and polite. She was patient with my elderly grandmother, who takes awhile to walk to the table, and even spoke Spanish to her when she realized that might be easier for her (my grandma doesn't speak much English). So, even though CPK is not my first choice when dining out, I have to admit the memory of that 5 cheese pizza still stands out in my mind...maybe I will skip the salad, wear stretchy pants, and order one for myself next time.  :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento?start=240,3.2,3.2,3.2,3.4440000000000004,3.2000000000000006

171,Matthew G.,"Sacramento, CA",5,271,18.0,2.0,2012-04-24,"This place is not a bad restaurant but it's just not for me and here's why. 1. I really don't need a waitress/waiter when it comes to pizza. I 'd rather save the 15% I spent on a tip and get a pizza to go from somewhere and eat it in the comfort of my home. 2. The pizza's are small and only come in one size. The pizzas are cut into six slices and me and my girlfriend shared one and each of us had a salad. If I didn't have the salad I could have easily eaten one by myself.  3. The pizzas are expensive. I paid $13 for a six slice Chicken and Garlic pizza. My dollar could go way farther somewhere else. Don't get me wrong, the food tasted fine. It was fresh, non greasy, and there was a good variety to choose from. But at the end of the day it just was not worth the tab I racked up.

They definitely have a large range of pizzas to choose from. They had a chicken club pizza which is exactly like a chicken club sandwich, except they added greens on top. I had never seen a pizza with fresh greens on top but it did taste great. And this means you are gettting pizza and a salad for one! They have a lot of pizzas with salads on top, so I would recommend trying those! The flat bread pizza is a bit bigger than the regular crust pizza..that is why they charge $1.50 more to make your pizza flat bread. And we cant forget the free house bread, YUM!

Apparently I love this place soooo much,  everyone in my life thinks CPK is synonymous with ME! Their menu is large, but not overwhelming. You aren't limited to just pizza, and their flavors are boundless - traditional to unique. I've tried almost everything on their menu, I proudly state this by the way, and I can get down with almost anything...but I do have my faves and go-to's! All time faves list: Apps - spinach dip and the avocado egg rolls Salads - Chinese chicken salad and the Cesar Pizza - Roasted Chicken Garlic and Tostada, sans beans :/ Other - the Chicken sandwich on their delicious focaccia Desert - Butter-cake thing or apple crisp I do appreciate their libations, however they are steep. They pretty much only carry top shelf, so pricing is premium! Their cocktail list is girly, in general, but there are some good options - again, if you don't mind forking over your arm or leg. For this being an establishment in my top 5, this is lacking a star due to customer service. Turnover is high - so quality of employees isn't always on par.

The wait time usually isn't as ridiculous as another competitor down the way, so when we have a big party, we usually like to come here. Service is usually superb, and everything we order is always delicious and on point. Recently, it was a spontaneous girls night, and we decided to grab some dinner at CPK.

Well, they said they only had 3 servers for the night, so sitting us down wouldn't make sense, because it would take a server awhile to get to us. Hmm, interesting. Only 3 servers on a Friday night? Come on now. We were seated in about 15 minutes and our server was very prompt. We ordered a couple of drinks (really strong for my taste), and I ordered the caramelized peach salad, my sister ordered the margherita thin crust pizza, and my friend ordered the turkey club. Our food came out semi promptly, but the pizza my sister and I shared came out cold. Not warm, but  cold. The mozzarella didn't even have a chance to melt, so you could make out the small little circles of mozzarella on the dish. VERY disappointed, since this is one of my favorite pizzas.

I liked the original crust a bit more thin the skinny one, which was a tad too skinny. The California Club was the winner out of the two. It had hunks of bacon, lettuce drenched in mayo, tomato, chicken and huge slabs of avocado. The Jerk Chicken one had good flavor, but wasn't too impressive.

Menu: 3 stars: The menu is very speratic. A pizza restaurant that serves Chinese, Mexican, Italian, and even a Korean dish. The drink menu was good, a nice selection of beers. Price: 3 stars: The price was very average for the one size fits all pizza style. Although my daughter ordered a thin crust pizza and I a regular pepperoni, her pizza was twice the size of mine with the same amount of toppings for the same price. Food: 2 stars : The sauce was a little sweet and tomato paste tasting. The pepperoni was just ok not overly spicy. The sausage was nothing special. It was a very generic unimpressive pizza. It reminded me of defrosted pizza. Our beer was bad. We told the manager and she said checked and said we got the bottom of the keg.

Upon arriving, our side salad was not ready and had to wait another 7 minutes for it.  They also had no bread and after waiting 4 more minutes, we just took our bag and left as we had a state conference at the double tree across the street.   Upon opening our items, the sandwich was on the wrong bread, the caesar barely filled 1/4 of the container, and there was no sauce with the mac and cheese bites.  While we were starving and had a full 5 more hours of our conference we began eating only to find A HAIR in our sandwich!? I can only presume it is this location as the CPK's in LA, Ventura and Santa Barbara counties have always been spot-on.

While walking past one evening we spotted all the renovations going on (they were still serving); so my father walks in and they said not only will they be getting the new bar, but they are going to be getting something like 6-8 new TVs in there!

We had to wait around 15 minutes, during the wait, we were given a free appetizer of artichoke dip (yay and yum!). We were shortly seated afterwards. Customer service: 5 stars! Everyone was attentive and super friendly. They all attended to our questions and needs. TIPS: -Download their CPK app and create an account to get a free ""Small Plate"" I uploaded a menu of it. Max is 2 per a receipt, but they were friendly and gave us all 3 dish for free :) -If you sit by the pizza bar you get to watch the cooks at work, flipping dough and whatnot! -Free wifi Food: Spinach artichoke dip- The dip was nice and warm. Tasty. The chips were so-so, regular and purple colored chips. Pesto Cream Penne with shrimp- The pasta was sort of hard. The shrimp was big and flavorful. Portion is big enough for one or two people if you're splitting something else too. Overall, it was decent. Chicken Tequila Fettuccine- Had an unique taste to it, like a thai flavor. It was different from the normal pasta dishes we're used to. Hawaiian Pizza- my dad's must on a pizza is pineapple. They use fresh pineapples instead of ones from a can! So weird! All their pizzas are hand rolled! It was good agreed by everyone that tried it. Wild Mushroom- includes truffle oil. Didn't get to try :( But it was the first pizza to get snatched up! Didn't hear any complaints, so it must've been decent to delicious! Spicy Chipotle Chicken- didn't want to try. Heard it's a tad bit spicy, nothing you need to down a cup of water. Looks like there are a lot of different toppings, like a burrito exploded on a pizza haha Garlic Chicken Pizza- it's not on their menu but on the front page. It's one their popular pizza. I like this one a lot :) Our bill came out to be a bit over $100, not including the 18% gratuity they charged. Overall, I would come back again, for their service and food.

It was crowded for lunch, but not too crowded to where there was a wait, so the place had a nice energy. Our server was attentive and sweet, she may have been new because she didn't know what a Chimay was and seemed a little nervous around our large group, but her service level didn't suffer. Every time I come to California Pizza Kitchen (which is a lot!) I always know what to expect which is great! The food is extremely consistent (Yay no surprises!) and the service is always good. We ordered the Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps and the Spring Rolls for the table which everyone seemed to love (both had meat in them) and I ordered the Margherita Pizza which was amazing!! It had the perfect mix of olive oil, basil and cheese and when I added red pepper flakes it was perfect! Nice thin crispy crust too. Their pizzas are big enough for two people to share with an appetizer, or for one person to eat and have plenty for leftovers! I also had a glass of their Berry Sangria which was so great! Sangria for me can be hit or miss, so I tried this one based on a recommendation from a coworker. It came in a huge glass and was so good and refreshing! Definitely recommended if you like or even kind of like sangria.

She didn't seem to be working at all. No hustle. And the stares on our way to our seat was so uncomfortable.  We looked at the menus & the reason why we chose this place was bc we wanted pizza. So we ordered the California Classic I believe (name might be wrong) and we substituted the bacon for pepperoni.  The wait time was fairly long. And it was not worth the wait. It arrives and it's a small round thing with a bunch of lettuce on top. What? I didn't know I had ordered a salad on my pizza. It has no sauce, just lettuce, tomatoes, avocado, some sort of really thin chicken & pepperoni. Maybe bc I'm not into eating healthy food but boy I had never tasted a pizza so bland in my life. It literally had NO flavor to it. I wish we would have just gone down the street to BJs and had awesome pizza for a little higher price.  The waitress only came around one time to ask how we were doing.  Then she called us ""kids"" when she brought the bill. What? Anyways. Probably won't be back here again.

Having Angry Orchard on tap is also super nice when I want something a tad stronger than lemonade. Haha.  Even their more traditional pizzas like pepperoni or pepperoni and sausage are delicious.

At first, my friend and I thought it was a potato wedge with all of those things, or maybe a a batch of potato wedges. It was actually a just a wedge of iceberg lettuce. It is literally just a lazy person's salad. Just a wedge of lettuce with all of those things on top. Nothing special at all, but hey, it was free so I can't complain.

The pizza was good, but I have had a lot better. If anyone wants good pizza, I would recommend pizza rock on K street.  Honestly, the best part of the pizza was when we asked for parmesan cheese and the red pepper flakes. The parmesan wasn't the usual form that comes in a packet, it was actual parmesan cheese that was grated. Sadly, besides the service, this was the best part of my meal.

So we ordered two appetizers and two pizzas to share. We got no bread until we literally asked three people for it. Then we got two plates of bread. We then had to ask for plates, napkins and silverware because none were provided. This should be standard. I didn't think we were Cavemen and had to eat with our hands or wipe our hands on our clothes.  But anyway, I can't even remember our waiter's name but we were seated directly to the right near the bar when you walk in at a table. The food is o.k. but the service is ugh and unacceptable.

With one bite into The Works, your taste buds will get pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, red onions, olives, oregano, and of course mozzarella. The crust and bottom of the pizza is crispy for that extra crunch. There are many other combinations of pizzas for you to choose from and each pizza has 6 slices so leftovers are highly probable. CPK also has appetizers, soups, salads, pastas, main entrees, and desserts. There is a bar where they serve wine, mixed drinks, and beer.  Of all the times I have been here, service has been great which made the visits more enjoyable. They refilled drinks, got us extra items like ranch, napkins, red pepper flakes, and cheese. Everyone greets us as we walk by and also engage in small chit chat.  CPK does have tvs all over the restaurant showing different sports games.

We thought to come here and sit for a change! Long story short, the first part of the experience wasn't that good as we waited for so long! Ashley showed up soon after I told the guy on the counter. She, politely and genuinely apologized which made us feel much better :). She then offered us an appetizer for free to make it up for us, so far so good!.  We ordered our favorite pizzas: Margarita pizza ( + tomatoes and extra basil) and the BBQ chicken pizza. We also ordered the free appetizer, some pasta. By the way, I love the bread with the olive oil they serve for free.  We were so happy with the quality and the taste of our food, we enjoyed it. Ashley kept on checking on us making sure we are happy and enjoying our meal and time. We even chatted a little bit about our families and personal lives.  Once we were done, Ashley put the leftovers in boxes, thanked us, wished us a good night and then left. I was confused on where I should pay, i thought they will bring me the check!!! So I went and asked Ashley, here manager Loren was there and she said: ""I got this, you waited so long (it wasn't that long actually) so i got this :) don't worry about it"" and I was speechless, didn't know what to say.  It was, by far, the most amazing experience I had here in Sacramento, not because of the free food and the amazing service I received, but because they were sensitive and sincerely felt sorry for letting us wait.

38,Ray L.,"Folsom, CA",359,213,275.0,4.0,2015-11-15,"I usually shy away from writing reviews on chain restaurants, but after my visit to CPK yesterday -I just couldn't help myself. Like most self proclaimed "" foodies"" , I tend to seek out family owned restaurants that are different from the norm. Since it is in my nature to "" fight the man"" , I would rather spend my hard earned money supporting local businesses rather than add to the bottom line of corporate giants. However, sometimes I need the consistency and selection that a place like CPK offers. Here is my recap from my visit yesterday: 1. For Lunch , I chose "" The Works"" which is CPK's version of what I have always considered a ""combination"" pizza (pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, red onion, green peppers, and olives). The tomato sauce  was flavorful , and was spread evenly throughout the pie. The cheese to toppings ratio was perfect, and CPK managed to not burn the crust despite being on the thinner side. With a dash of red peppers and parmesan cheese -my meal was complete. 2. My wife opted for the two-in-a bowl soup combination. The fact that both soups were served in the same bowl without some sort of divider surprised me a little bit. I expected some sort of customized bowl that prevented the 2 soups from intermingling. However, my wife made it work by eating the split pea soup first , and the baked potato soup after.  * Since my wife is pregnant , she couldn't stop there -lol. She also ordered a petite wedge salad that was on the menu under "" small plates"". The salad comes standard with blue cheese dressing  (she opted for ranch dressing instead) , bacon, egg, and tomatoes. The lettuce was not soggy,  and there was just enough dressing added. The attention to detail at CPK is amazing. The pizza, pasta, and salads are well crafted, and the ingredients used are top-notch.  CPK doesn't make the best pizza or pasta that I ever had, but they do everything well. When you are in the mood to eat but are not quite sure what you want, I would suggest giving CPK a try if you haven't already. However, since CPK operates in 30 + states- I am pretty sure you have tried it at least once.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento?start=20,3.52,3.53,3.53,3.152,3.5260000000000002

The pizza, however, was impressive.  The crusts were cooked well, toppings distributed, not over loaded.  Just enough to capture the flavor and texture combination of each.  Plenty left over and carried home.

283,D E.,"Sacramento, CA",1,5,,1.0,2016-07-30,"I had a horrible experience this evening with CPK on Arden.  After a difficult day -- a car accident that left me laid up, I decided to order CPK for delivery through a 3rd party delivery service.  The delivery service's job is to pick up the order and deliver it, that's it.   When I ordered, however, on a system that send the information to CPK, along with notes, I ordered 2 salads and specifically added ""please don't forget the dressing.""  This note was made because this particular restaurant is notorious for leaving something out of to go orders.  Well, the delivery was made and, no dressing. I called the delivery service who was quite obnoxious about it (so I won't be using Food to You anymore), but did offer pick up my dressings.  Well 2.5 hours later, no dressing. I got in the car and drove over.  I called on the way to ask if they could have two dressings ready.  The young woman on the phone (the hostess I learned when I arrived) was very sweet and very helpful and apologized for the missing dressings.  So, when I arrived, I was quite surprised when the Manager decided to question ... a woman who ordered a delivery, because she had an accident and was laid up, who drove over 7 miles to retrieve dressing for those salads ... really?  She insisted I must have received the salad dressing because she personally had been helping with the take-out orders. Again, who lies about receiving salad dressing on a delivery order simply to drive over for 2 1/4 cup size dressings? When I questioned why she was questioning me, she said she wasn't (although when she left the man waiting next to me confirmed for me how rude she was to me!).  When she returned with 2 dressings she shoved them at me and barked ""I'm sorry.""  I could have just taken the dressing and left ... but she was so rude I asked if I could speak to the manager.  Well, it turned out SHE IS THE MANAGER!  Wow.  I work for a very large organization that serves customers (members actually) and if any one of my staff treated them the way she treated me, they'd have some pretty serious explaining to do.

They offered us some bread and oil to start while we looked at the menus. The oil has a distinct mixture of herbs in it that makes it fantastic. We also usually get the hummus and pita bread appetizer. The hummus is very good because it's simple. It's not like most kinds you get from the grocery store, it's very plain and I like that. For dinner I also keep it simple with just pepperoni pizza. Their thin or regular crust is very good. In the pizza they sprinkle another herb for flavor that is so unique to their restaurant, I've never had it like that anywhere else. Again, I really love it it's what makes California Pizza Kitchen so edgy and different. The staff was very friendly and always is every time I come here. Last night we sat at the bar where we could see the guys tossing pizza dough and putting the pizzas in the fire oven. Really neat environment to have dinner in and is why my boyfriend and I love it. I do have to mention, although it's silly, my chair was broken last night and I was rocking back and forth during my meal. No big deal, I could've moved over, because we were the only ones sitting at the bar, however it seems like if a child or elderly person got that stool it could be dangerous.

Wasn't much room on the table to share our food with each other. The avocado egg roll was good but my pizza was just mushy. I couldn't lift it up without the topping falling all over my plate. Since the toppings were heavy, the pizza wouldn't hold up right even when I fold it. The dough was still chewy. And my fiancé pasta dish just looked so sad and unappetizing. He said it was bland and the chicken had no flavor. This pasta dish was about $16, not worth it. I had come in at a time where it wasn't busy. my waitress just took our order, didn't check up on us, nor could I find her. I was in need of more water since the pizza was spicy but since she was not around, I had to take my fiancé drink. Although he needed a drink too, he insisted on me having the last sip.

The shrimp was cooked to perfection, but I wish the tail wasn't on there, since it made it a little tougher to get the whole shrimp. The amount they give you is a good amount. Their BBQ chicken pizza was okay. It was a little salty, but there was enough ingredients on top and the crust wasn't too thick or thin. I wouldn't choose to order it again...

We shared an order of baked Tortilla Spring rolls: one Mediterranean Veggie roll (Wild mushrooms, eggplant, sun-dried tomatoes, caramelized onions, Mozzarella and Parmesan. Served with marinara) and one Thai Chicken roll (Peanut sauce, bean sprouts, scallions, carrots, fresh cilantro and Mozzarella. Served with Thai peanut sauce.)  It was a bit pricey for two rolls.  I liked both of them but preferred the veggie roll's milder flavor. We also shared a pizza: the California Club which featured applewood smoked bacon, roasted chicken, mozzarella, and topped with avocado, wild arugula, fresh torn basil and Romaine tossed in lemon-pepper mayo.  While I loved the chewy, toasty crust, I didn't really care for what was essentially a salad on top of my pizza!  It was difficult to execute: biting into my piece of pizza without the loose arugula falling off.  After the first slice as-is, I had to scrape the greens off.  But, what was left behind was a sauceless piece of pizza with noticeably salty bacon pieces.  The pizza's ""sauce"", a tasty lemony mayo, was on the greens that I'd scraped onto the butter plate!   But. The balance of flavor was restored back to the pizza after Austin kindly brought us a side of that mayo and we spread it on like butter!  I'm glad we tried the pizza, it tasted good except for the overly salted bacon.

There's usually a wait because of its proximity to the movie theater and Arden Fair Mall.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento?start=20,3.8,3.51,3.504,,3.626

I doubt CPK will be so easy to venture into in a month.  Comfortable seating.  Quick and friendly fun service.  The ""Reviver"" beverage was a hit.  The Lemongrass Chicken was delicious and cooked perfectly.  The bread was hot and the dipping oil/seasonings were perfect.  I do recommend this restaurant if you're at Arden Mall and are looking for a nice restaurant to enjoy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento,3.72,3.5,3.524,,3.5880000000000005

After sitting in a malfunctioning warmer for 15 minutes, my pizza was as cold and tough as a frisbee, and my ""hot"" soup was not. I asked for the manager so I could administer an IQ test, but after waiting for another five minutes I gave up. I will just dispute the charge.

39,A W.,"Richmond, CA",0,22,,5.0,2017-11-11,"5 stars specifically for the manager's (Bob) excellent customer service and keen eye. Had a great meal the food was awesome and the service was fine until we paid our bill and then decided we should have dessert on the spur of the moment. My sister politely asked the bartender, who was immediately in our line of sight because we were seated right next to the bar, for a dessert menu as our waitress had already left because the bill was paid and she thought we were leaving. Well his reply was so nasty that my sister was on the fence about whether or not we should ever go back. His tone, his body language and even his words gave the impression that he just could not be bothered. Bob to the rescue. He noticed the interaction from a distance. He came over and intervened in the conversation between my sister and the bartender in the most professional of ways. He was all too willing to take our order and even had a recommendation for how to save a relationship because the Butter Cake is absolutely to die for and would surely be worth a fight for the last bite. You know how you can have such a bad experience that you completely write off a business for good and nothing can fix it? Bob fixed it. A shining example of how interpersonal communication skills can go such a long way in providing a pleasant customer experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento?start=20,3.64,3.5,3.524,,3.5560000000000005
22,Jamye Amy Z.,"North Highlands, CA",18,11,10.0,4.0,2017-11-18,I have an hour both very excited to try this place for the first time. We got lunch special with the Mediterranean salad and sausage mushroom and pepper any pizza. I got the fettuccine with shrimp. The menu said nothing about it being cooked all done today but let me tell you that was barely cooked. I waited for the man who brought our food over to our table which were not our waitress. And he was very very rude. We had asked him for the dressing that came with my husband salad and some more bread and he never came back. I looked around after I tasted my pastor to see if the man or a waitress was coming back and neither of them were. I seen our waitress in the bar area so I approached her and asked her if she could please ask them to cook the pasta longer. So well I guess she was telling the manager and seeing if they could cook it longer my husband shared his lunch with me because he felt bad that my fettuccine was so awful. The manager brought my pasta back to the table and stood there and said he wanted me to try it why he was standing there to see if I liked it that this time. And he said Att told me at that time that it is known that they put their pasta at dente. Well not only was it not cooked the second time when I asked told him he said well if I take it back again it's going to be mush and I said OK that's fine I cannot eat the pasta like this. Not only was it still hard but it was cold and I don't understand if they cooked it some more how could it be called? So by the time it came back the third time I had shared his lunch and was basically finished. When it came back the last time it had no white sauce on it at all . The managers but there again and I told him it was fine that we just wanted our check So he said that he took Alfredo off of our bill which was nice. He gave me a box to take it with me. When I got home it was nothing but a pile of noodles with barely a drop of sauce and no fresh Parmesan cheese very very disappointing.I ended up throwing it away but the pizza and salad or very good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-sacramento?start=20,3.76,3.52,3.524,,3.616

It's one of my go to places in this part of Sacramento. Plus it's a good central location if you're meeting friends from different parts of town. It's in the part of the mall down by the movie theater. Lots of parking. Tip: Park in the back!!  I love how they have remodeled the restaurant. Lots of wood and textures. It feels very hip and modern, but cozy at the same time. I kind of wish my house looked like this place! LOL.  I always have great service here, even when it's very busy. When it's quiet I like to hang out and write or work on my phone. No one bothers you.  Great cocktails. I like the Honey Sangria....MMMMM. My go to food options are the Pepperoni, Sausage, Mushroom pizza or the Pesto Cream Penne with Chicken.
