17,Kate O.,"Alexandria, VA",28,486,85.0,3.0,2013-07-22,"Since this is an airport quick-service location, the menu is a condensed version of what you would find at a full-service restaurant.

What do you expect? Having said that, here is my not-so-flattering review. Given the very limited dining options at St.Louis Airport's Terminal 2, I opted for a quick salad and soup at CPK. With the exception of pizza and soup, everything else on their menu (sandwiches and salads) are all pre-packaged, ""grab-and-go"" type meals, which is appreciated in the rush of a busy terminal. The split pea soup was actually pretty good and it definitely hit the spot. It's a good size portion and comes with saltines. The quinoa salad, well, it's a pre-packaged salad that had been sitting awhile so I didn't expect much and it certainly met my expectations. Not good, not bad, just what you'd expect at an airport.

Thought about staying healthy and getting a salad, but I figured I hadn't had one of their pizzas in a while, so I would give it a shot. Pros: (1) pizza made fresh when you order it. Takes about 10-12 minutes. (2) overall taste was good (except for the crust, see below). Cons: (1) pizza crust is not good. Pretty much tasteless and dry. Absolutely not worth the calories. And this is coming from someone that pretty much liked ANY pizza .(2) Very little chicken on the pizza for the roughly $12 price; (3) Salads are not that tempting here because they are all prepared in advance, sitting in the front display area -- all that being said, if I come back -- likely at some point because options are so limited at STL's Terminal 2, I will definitely get a salad next time instead of a pizza!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-saint-louis-6?start=20,1.4800000000000002,1.4800000000000002,1.4800000000000002,1.4800000000000002,1.4800000000000002

One was pre-making pizzas with her back to the counter, the other one walking back and forth and studiously avoiding the line of customers waiting to order. She checked pizzas cooking, walked back and forth, avoided eye contact with us, checked cooking pizzas again...  this went on for quite some time. When she did come to the front, she noticed I had cash in my hand. ""Debit or credit!!"" she said. I did not understand she was talking to me, so she repeated, ""I can only take debit or credit!"" So I walked away. I don't expect great service in an airport self serve joint, but this was atrocious. Rude, uncaring, and not even an ""I'm sorry"" for their inability to accept legal tender. The staff needs to be reminded that they are in a customer service job. The TSA agents were nicer, friendlier, and gave far better service.

The girl is like, ""I don't know, then you would have to get a refund"" so why is that a problem?

Well this chicken pesto sandwich lived right up to the previous statement.  The tomatoes look like they had been hit with an ugly stick.  So, I passed on eating those .  The actual chicken pesto sandwich  tasted like seasoned   canned meat.  I thought the sandwich would cost no more than $8 but I want say it came to around $12, For that amount, I could have purchased one of those half done looking crackers with meat and cheese that this joint passes off as pizza.  Really a   0/5 stars  Money well wasted !!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-saint-louis-6,1.68,1.68,1.68,,1.6800000000000002
22,L C.,"Nashville, TN",4,8,11.0,2.0,2017-11-03,"I ordered the Margherita pizza which was $2 more than a plain cheese pizza. There's a small pile of ""fresh basil"" on ONE slice.  It had TWO small pieces of Italian tomatoes. Doesn't look like a specialty pizza to me. When I kindly told the lady that next time they have this order, they should spread the extra toppings along all the slices she made up excuse about it being pre-made mixes. She refused to admit that they could have done a better job. She offered to have them remake it but I don't believe in having food remade by a bitter cook. I'll just eat my plain cheese pizza as is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-saint-louis-6,1.72,1.72,1.72,,1.7200000000000002
