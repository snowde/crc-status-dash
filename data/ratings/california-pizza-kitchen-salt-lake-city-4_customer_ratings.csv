Even with that, I was stunned by the rudeness of the girl taking the order at the counter. I had a few minutes for breakfast before my flight, so I decided to get a breakfast burrito. Here's the exchange: Me: I'd like the breakfast burrito please. Girl: What meat? Me: Uh...where are the choices? Girl puts finger over her shoulder to point at the sign. Me: I'm sorry. I don't see where the choices are. Girl: What meat? I'm trying to scan the whole menu board as fast as I can before I finally see it under the item. I know that I might've been a little slow because it was the morning, but my question is: Â wouldn't it have been faster and easier if she just asked, ""bacon or sausage?"" I think so.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-salt-lake-city-4,,,,,
