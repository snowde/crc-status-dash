24,Brendan K.,"Salt Lake City, UT",160,68,151.0,4.0,2012-01-10,"We all have guilty pleasures, and CPK is one of mine! I'm not a huge fan of chain eateries, but when ever I sell my soul I tend to find myself here. Like Sky said I'm a fan of the open kitchen idea. It says I have nothing to hide, and coming from an intensive restaurant background IT REALLY SAYS A LOT! wink wink! I plead the fifth!  I have tried a plethora of items on the menu from pastas, hummus, pork tacos to pizzas. I have to say they have such a wide variety of items that it can be a bit overwhelming, let me ease your angst. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  The staff here is typically amazing even on a weekend night, they're knowledgeable, experienced, and know their stuff. If you have the chance give Bob a try he's one of the best servers you'll ever have. Take care of him, and tell him Brendan sent you! :)  In conclusion, when at Gateway and you need a culinary treat step into the CPK, ask for Bob, and enjoy!  P.S. Don't be afraid to try the kids mac 'n cheese! It's amazing and no modicum size either! Seriously, crazy good! You'll probably see me in the corner eating the Sicilian Pizza stealing bites of my sons Mac N Cheese!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-salt-lake-city?start=40,2.9920000000000004,2.9920000000000004,2.9920000000000004,2.9920000000000004,2.992000000000001

We were seated quickly however that was the last ""quick"" thing that happened. We sat for quite a while before our waiter came to take our drink order and then I noticed that he was preoccupied with a large table. We informed him we were ready to order as well which seemed to get him flustered. Another man brought out our order and I had to flag down our waiter to get refills. He brought my husband a 2nd soda however did not bring me a refill of water -- WATER!! I waited and waited - he was helping the big table, stood in front of our table talking to another waiter and still no refill. I had to ask him a 2nd time for a refill of water - I just cut my losses and told him we were ready for the check. Horrible service. The food was not very good and definitely not worth the cost.

We had slightly less than an hour to eat before the movie so we chose to go to California Pizza Kitchen which was right next door.  Our son and his friends got better service from Dominos after the Warped Tour.  We were seated outside and waited a full ten minutes before we were even acknowledged by the waitress.  When she finally broke away from her conversation with another server, we ordered our drinks and food at the same time.  Before we ordered, we asked if there would be enough time to get our food and make it to the movie.  ""Absolutely!""  After she brought our drinks, we didn't see her again until we were ready to leave.  Another server brought our food and got us silverware, no one checked to see how our food was.  A nice lady in a yellow dress brought us more water and got our check for us.  After we paid and were getting up to leave, our waitress finally came over to see how our dinner was.  (She brought us a duplicate check also.)  The food was good and we will try the restaurant again, but not that location.  Management seriously needs train their staff better.

90,Daniel K.,"Salt Lake City, UT",8,35,25.0,2.0,2014-03-23,"I won't return, simply because it is overpriced mediocre food. We went in a larger group, so I was able to try a bit of everything.  I don't mind pricey food, and wasn't shocked (like others in our party) that the pizza size was about the size of a large dinner plate.  Good thing we asked before we ordered, because sharing a pizza might be fine for some, but not for the hungry. I love the way the pizzas were prepared, but in the end, they were tough, rubbery, and honestly not amazing.  If you like tough pizza, you might like CPK.  My wife got a shrimp pasta of some kind, and it was pretty good.  Given the name of the restaurant, it's bad when the pizzas are the worst thing on the menu. We did not get the thin crust pizzas, yet the pizza was still really thin.  I don't mind thin pizza, I just hate to think of how much you would feel ripped off if you did order the thin crust.  Do yourself a favor, and avoid this place if you want some pizza.  All of the chain places (even the bad ones) have better pizza, and much better value.  Don't get me wrong, the pizza isn't awful, because how could pizza taste bad?  It's just among some of the lamest pizza I've had.  Fresh, lame pizza. Enough about the food.  If you're into cramped seating, this is the place for you.  You may not notice with the lower lighting, but with the sunlight, it won't matter.  Use the bathroom at another establishment too: there is freezing cold water (no hot water?) and drying your hands isn't easy either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-salt-lake-city?start=20,3.28,3.28,3.28,3.0160000000000005,3.2800000000000002

I had already paid and gotten the bill at the very beginning because we were all in a rush and wanted to have that out of the way. I didn't get any of my food until we all stood up hinting at them we were needing to leave back to work. The restaurant was not very busy and there was no reason it should have taken this long.

76,Darton N.,"Houston, TX",18,33,45.0,2.0,2016-07-09,"Two stars simply for attentive service. The ambience is what you expect of a restaurant downtown. Bustling movement, laughter, and overall family friendly. However, the food was very underwhelming especially when paired with the prices that California Pizza Kitchen offers. I started off (and finished) with the spinach artichoke dip that was hailed as one of their specialty dishes. What I expected was tufts of artichoke hearts and spinach baked in creamy goodness served piping hot with (maybe I set my expectations too high for a specialty) fresh tortilla chips. What I received however was a whole lot of.... lack in flavor. There was absolutely nothing special about it. Sure there was a good amount in there, but it didn't leave me wanting to dip in there more than three or four times. But let's be honest here, right? This is a pizza establishment. So let's level the playing field and judge from there. You can grab a medium pizza at say, a fast food chain, for about six dollars containing eight slices. But why wouldn't we want to spend a hefty fourteen to eighteen dollars for six pieces instead since it is the world renowned CPK? My family ordered the California Club and much to their dismay, out came a pizza no bigger than the trays the serve it on. The majority of the pizza was a salad. The sauce was nowhere to be found, the cheese barely apparent, and the bacon bits were scarce. What went wrong here? I have had peers tell me that they love it here, but it seems to be more hype than anything else. A bougie restaurant where pizzas are disguised as anything BUT pizzas. I don't even want to start on the pasta that my brother got because the price he paid for it and the amount served just seemed ridiculously unproportional. For a chain restaurant, I definitely had better standards. Thank you to our lovely waitress who made sure our cups were always filled to the brim and had the best attitude though. I'm just sorry the food wasn't as good the service. For now, I'll stick to the mom and pop pizza places if I wanna venture into something new. It'll take a lot for me to reconsider returning here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-salt-lake-city?start=20,3.52,3.52,3.52,,3.5200000000000005

Why would it not smell like fresh baked pizza dough...or ANY food for that matter? Suspect!  We were asked to wait about 5 mins to sit although we were the only ones waiting at the time and there were at least 10 tables open. We were finally seated next to a large family with a screaming toddler and a young boy bugling out tunes through a rolled up kids menu.  Appetite now beginning to wane.

8,Andrew S.,"Riverton, UT",160,382,102.0,4.0,2016-09-05,"I've always had an interesting relationship with CPK, mainly because to me it's just not somewhere that jumps and says ""come to me, come to me"" when I'm looking for somewhere to eat, but instead somewhere I've generally only gone to because others want to go and I bow to the peer pressure.  And every time I go, it's actually not that bad and I enjoy it...if this is as far as you need to read, my job is done! I think part of it is the name, and the fact that as soon as I see somewhere ""specialize"" in pizza I assume there's nothing else to offer, and that really isn't the case.  I've debated on prior visits to other locations between 3 or 4 stars because the pizza isn't anything I'd go out of the way for, and while they have many novel flavors, I've never been overly wowed by them, nor would I personally order a whole one for myself.  However, with that, what I can say is there are some good varieties of pizza, and many taste great for a slice or two and then just are lacking after that.  The trick, go with a group and get several varieties and share - it really makes it a much better experience.  My favorites, Original BBQ Chicken, Spicy Chipotle Chicken and Thai Chicken. However, while the pizza may not be quite as extraordinary as the name might be trying to make it out to be, the selection here goes well beyond that with good sandwiches, salads, pastas, soups...I think you get the idea, there is truly something for everyone. On a recent visit to this particular CPK, I got one of their specials which was Roasted Garlic Chicken with Seasonal Vegetables.  This was truly really good, with tender, flavorful chicken along with great tasting caramelized veggies that really hit the spot.  Not much was left and let's just say my plan to have some left overs went straight out the window! Service was good, friendly and our server was totally on top of keeping our waters refilled.  I like the low light ambience of this particular location, it's very warm and inviting and just adds an extra touch that helps it not to seem so chain like. I suspect I may gripe less in the future when a suggestion of CPK comes up!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-salt-lake-city,3.4,3.4,3.4,,3.4000000000000004

But literally the salad was some iceberg lettuce, 10 black beans, WAY too many tomatoes (with a yucky weird old texture), and 5 tortilla strips sprinkled on top. And it was upwards of $15. I left hungry and unimpressed. It was bland and boring and the service was meh as well. We were one of 5 tables and it took us 15 minutes to get our check after we were done. Won't be back.

I called in this morning and placed a reservation for 6:30pm on the dot for my entire family of 21 individuals. We all planned to eat before attending a Jazz game. This is why I placed the reservation. They said they would absolutely have our table ready but if we were a minute late they would give it away. All 21 of us showed up 10 minutes early (6:20pm) and discovered they had lost our reservation. ""Don't worry"", they said. We will get you back in a table in 10 minutes. We didn't get seated until 7:15pm. We literally waited for our seats, after placing a reservation, for 45 minutes. I understand they can't quite control the fact that all of their seats were physically occupied. They couldn't kick someone out of their spot. They had to wait until parties left to accommodate us. I get this. I get the reasons we had to wait. We tried to look at the menu and order our food while we were waiting. They initially said no to this, but eventually let us. The problem is that they never said sorry for losing my reservation and they never tried to make up for it. Like I said, I understand they couldn't magically create a table that seats 21 people after having lost the reservation. But they can make up for that by offering us all free drinks. Free desserts. An apology. Sure the food was ok. Our waitress was nice and great. But dang if I come to your restaurant and make a reservation for 21 people, it's for a reason. We have tickets to an event and can't sit and wait for 45 minutes for a table. We ended up missing the first quarter of the game because of the experience. Before writing this review, my wife tried to talk me out of it, because really, we feel bad for business that have seen failure at the Gateway. I really wish it could go back to how it was 10-15 years ago. I always try to visit the Gateway to help it survive.

The server (Matthew on the receipt or Nate on his name tag) stunk of BO so bad it made your eyes water. He didn't look dirty or anything, but oh god did he stink.

2,D C.,"Austin, TX",3,9,,1.0,2017-12-23,"One of the worst dining experiences I can remember having.  Was with my 5 yr old son enjoying the Gateway mall and Xmas time festivities, and wanted to grab a quick dinner.  The hostess was very nice and got us seated right away on a busy Saturday night.  From there, it was downhill, waited about 15 minutes, no one came by....no water, no acknowledgement, finally flagged a waiter down to place our order.  Then had another 30 minute wait for the food to come out.  Unfortunately, the food I ordered for my son, who was quite hungry and rambunctious, did not come out.  Waited another 5 minutes for his food, by that time just fed up and got out of there.  Food was just ok.  Waitress seemed oblivious.  I've been to many CPKs over the years, and this seems to be the outlier, but man what a buzzkill to an otherwise fun day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-salt-lake-city,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76

I ordered a banh mi bowl with the expectation that it would have the banhmi taste in a bowl - like a salad without the baguette. The food came out okay, not close at all to the banhmi's taste, but it's not bad.  Here's what listed as ingredients: Quinoa, baby kale, fresh cilantro & mint topped with warm grilled chicken, watermelon radish, fresh avocado, cucumber, carrot, bean sprouts, scallions and sesame seeds. Served with housemade chili-lime vinaigrette and serrano peppers.   Generally I'd recommend them to change the name to be less misleading - it's good on its own without having to borrow a name.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-salt-lake-city,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72
