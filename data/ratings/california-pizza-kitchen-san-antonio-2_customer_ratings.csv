We came in after the lunch rush. Service was great and the food was FABULOUS!!! We ordered a caramelized peach salad (full not half) and a California Club pizza and split both between us. The salad was one of the best I've had anywhere. It featured my usual faves, like cranberries, pecans and Gorgonzola, but the peaches & the vinaigrette really made it pop. I highly recommend trying it. The pizza was great. Really just an addition to the salad, but held its own nonetheless especially with the bacon... And the crust... Seriously makes my mouth water just thinking about it. Not oily or greasy at all.. Just a REAL pizza dough flavor cooked perfectly. It was great! We finished it off with the chocolate suflee  and strawberry shortcake, both with ice cream... Maybe a bit too much for a hot day, but whatever, they were both amazing.

29,Ashley S.,"Shelby, MS",59,46,12.0,5.0,2014-07-05,"I feel pretty naive in saying this was my first visit to a California Pizza Kitchen. My goodness I'm glad hubs talked me into it!!! We came in after the lunch rush. Service was great and the food was FABULOUS!!! We ordered a caramelized peach salad (full not half) and a California Club pizza and split both between us. The salad was one of the best I've had anywhere. It featured my usual faves, like cranberries, pecans and Gorgonzola, but the peaches & the vinaigrette really made it pop. I highly recommend trying it. The pizza was great. Really just an addition to the salad, but held its own nonetheless especially with the bacon... And the crust... Seriously makes my mouth water just thinking about it. Not oily or greasy at all.. Just a REAL pizza dough flavor cooked perfectly. It was great! We finished it off with the chocolate suflee  and strawberry shortcake, both with ice cream... Maybe a bit too much for a hot day, but whatever, they were both amazing. I have zero complaints on this visit and will definitely be back as soon as I find a location closer to home!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-antonio-2?start=20,4.08,4.08,4.08,3.4120000000000004,4.08

I had forgotten to ask for ""dressing on the side"" as I usually do, but it came that way. I started to ask for another dressing, but combo of flavors in salad really didn't need the dressing, so I ate it without. manager heard it was our first visit, came over to ask us how everything was, then also told us about free app offer and gave us a coupon for another small plate to use next visit. server was very attentive and friendly and and dishes were cleared and drinks refilled promptly. lunch special of 7"" pizza and soup or salad was $10.95 and soup sammie and soup salad combos offered for $1 or $2 less. apps $4-$7.

Luckily the rain that was threatening to ruin our Veteran's Meal held off and we pulled up to an empty CPK around 1015.  We peeped in and saw workers scurrying by as I'm sure they knew the Veteran's and Active Duty Crowd would be pouring in as the doors were unlocked.  After walking around window shopping for 30 or so minutes, the family and I returned to roughly a 3 person line that was starting to grow by the second.  We hopped in line and within ten minutes were seated by a gracious host and an attentive waiter. The Sister and I shared a BBQ Pizza and donated her Hawaiian Pizza to the nieces who happily gobbled up and pulled apart their ham and pineapples meal.. The brother n law ate a rather large salad, which I'm surprised he was able to finish after all the pancakes we had consumed that morning.  The waiter was quick and within minutes every seat in the establishment was full.  I can't say it's worth waiting 2 hours in line but this AF Veteran and Army Soldier along with her family enjoyed yet another Free Meal on Veteran's day.

I loved the atmosphere here and everyone was very nice.  The food was better than I had expected it to be.  So, that is a plus.  I ordered the Pear Gorgonzola Pizza that was $13.39, I asked for it to be on hand tossed crust.  It was amazingly good.  I also go a cup of Baked Potato soup which was also amazing $4.79, plus my drink Fresh Strawberry Mango Cooler $2.99.  The pizza is big enough for two people to share, however, if you're really hungry - a whole one is a good size.  The price of the items are not that expensive, I think this is a really good place to go to if you're on a budget, but also a good place if you better options than any fast food restaurants.  Now on customer service.  Macie, our server was very nice.  She seemed to really go out of her way to make sure we had everything we needed.  My friend ordered a Mojito while I ordered the Strawberry Mango, however, our server brought us water later on without us even ordering it.  I thought that was very thoughtful of her.  That is what makes a server stand out, little things such as the thoughtfulness of the needs of their customers without the customers even asking.   I would recommend others to come check out California Pizza Kitchen at this location for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-antonio-2,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.216,4.0
