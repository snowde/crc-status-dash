51,Edgardo G.,"San Antonio, TX",19,3,,2.0,2012-01-08,"2.5 stars. The 2.5 stars might seem surprising for some people but let me give you my ONE reason:  Almost everything on the menu has cilantro. Not cool. They should teach you in chef school that cilantro is not like salt and pepper. I know I sound harsh but c'mon... Otherwise, good service, wait times arent crazy long. Makes a neat lunch ""break"" from shopping and its bar area is cool as you can see the cooks at work.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-antonio?start=40,3.0800000000000005,3.0800000000000005,3.0800000000000005,3.0800000000000005,3.0800000000000005

Our server was friendly, attentive, and we never had to ask for drinks as she refilled them constantly. The food was spectacular...I generally don't like pizza but we got a BBQ Chicken Pizza and some tortilla spring rolls. Honestly, the pizza was great but I could have made a meal out of the tortilla spring rolls, they were so great. My only complaint was the noise in the restaurant...that has got to be the loudest restaurant I've ever eaten in. It was so loud I couldn't hear myself think at one point. Of course there is nothing that CPK can do about it, unless they wanna anger some customers but it's certainly not a place where you wanna go if you have a headache.

I went with a friend and we agreed the best thing we had was the shrimp lettuce wraps as an appetizer; our individual entrees weren't really worth mentioning, nor was the dessert.

27,Jade M.,"San Antonio, TX",204,645,1576.0,4.0,2013-01-19,"I'm definitely a fan of California Pizza Kitchen - especially their Sicilian Pizza - so DELISH!!!! This restaurant isn't very big but they have a nice outdoor seating area. Sourdough bread comes with the meal - ask for it if the server doesn't bring you some. The Club Sandwich has fresh ingredients and yummy foccacia bread. I'm not a big fan of either of their soups - they both taste mushy to me. I tried the Jerk Chicken Pizza the last time I was there - it looked good, but tasted so-so. The Spicy Chicken Tinga Quesadilla was surprisingly delicious - you could make this an entree if you're a small eater. The Fire Roasted Chile Relleno is small and could be better. The Carmelized Peach Salad is delicious and could be a meal all by itself. For dessert, no question - order the Belgian Chocolate Souffle Cake with ice cream. YUMMO.  Service - I have generally had great service at this restaurant except ONCE. I had a bill of $25 and ordered $30 worth of food to-go (which was packed up by someone other than our waiter). Our waiter didn't come to refill our drinks and after dropping off our food, came back once more to drop off the check. This would have been all fine if he didn't add $15 on to the tip I left him - which was not a meager tip - I left him $5 on my credit card, which is more than 15% - and it wasn't even stellar service!! I was rather surprised to see the additional charge on my bank statement. I called the restaurant and was helped by the manager Heather - she apologized and credited the money back to my account. Lesson learned - use cash.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-antonio?start=20,3.3760000000000003,3.3760000000000003,3.3760000000000003,3.3760000000000003,3.376000000000001

Seriously though, there isn't ANYTHING on the menu that compares to how great that buffalo chicken pizza dipped in gorgonzola ranch was (unless you venture on up to Freetail off of 1604 because they have it). But back to CPK, if I HAVE to go, and we're talking friend's going away luncheon, birthday meal chosen by someone else, or Veteran's Day when they give vets a free pizza [ ;) ], this is never my place of choice. It isn't just that the parking lot is small and people become blind to the stop signs that are there to prevent them from hitting my car, nor is it the lackluster flavor that 5 years ago was great and either my tastebuds have evolved or their quality has dropped off, the root of the problem is that they no longer have their buffalo chicken pizza with gorgonzola ranch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-antonio?start=40,3.36,3.36,3.36,3.2440000000000007,3.3600000000000003

AH! he's so dreamy!! okay back to the drink. anyway it was one of the best margaritas i had it was topped off with fresh oranges and lime, sour agave, chipotle adobo, and cointreau which is a orange flavoring. the tequila had a nice smooth citrus taste to it. i hope they keep this drink on the menu. i saw glasses and glasses coming in from the bar!   i got the jambalaya fettuccine ($15.99)  and it's one of my favorite pastas here. it comes with the blackened chicken and shrimp, crawfish, sausage and ham. i like how it's super cajuny but i didn't really taste much of the spice at this location. luckily there was red crushed peppers and cholula hot sauce on our table. sometimes i like to take the complimentary bread and dip it into the sauce. definitely a great dish to order. another one of my favorites here and probably their popular dish is the original bbq chicken pizza ($13.59) i like how the flavors blend together and it's not too saucy. each bite is great and i like how there are loads of sliced red onions on top. overall our experience was nice. one star off because our server was SUPER SLOW. either he was new or he was very forgetful. he took forever to bring us things we've asked and as well as our check.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-antonio?start=40,3.36,3.36,3.36,3.408,3.3600000000000003

The hostess and server both treated us with the utmost respect and did not judge our party by the way we looked. The server had the best sense of humor. Watching how they interact with people it's obvious they get a feel for how you are and then that same personality comes out in them. If you crack a joke or two then they tend to lighten up. If you're more on the serious side, so are they. This was just an observation.  Now, onto the food. They have these neat little ""small plates"". They are pretty good as appetizers. Not bad on price either.  The Mergharita pizza is the BEST!! You have to try it at least once. It doesn't have meat on it, but it is so so yummy!!! The meat pizza is delish too. The table next to us had a wedge salad and looked really fresh. Maybe I'll try that sometime. We just tend to go for what a place is known for.

16,Daniela B.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",8,106,40.0,5.0,2016-08-06,I have been pleased the many times I have come into this California pizza kitchen. The food is great and now have a pasta dish made out of zucchini. It taste fantastic sans the carbs. Their pizza is always so tasty like their spinach artichoke one. One of the managers is always walking around checking if the tables are doing well.  I like that aspect of this establishment which makes me come back as well as their rewards program! Andy was a great server.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-antonio,3.72,3.72,3.72,,3.7200000000000006
12,Amanda G.,"San Antonio, TX",138,80,77.0,2.0,2016-08-27,"The service needs improvement. Our server took over 7 minutes to greet us due to mingling with other staff members on a slow Saturday night. Our drink order took close to 5 minutes- again due to the server talking to staff members. Our soups, on the other hand, came out really fast! Our entrees took a little over 30 minutes though. It still was slow, so I'm not sure where the issue occurred. Complimentary bread and oil would have been nice during that long wait. We were THE ONLY table with out it. I honestly thought we had to order salads to get them. Otherwise I would have asked for some.  If we needed a refill they would take our glasses away for several minutes and then bring us another. At one point we had to share a drink. By the way they have a bar but no drink menu( unless we just didn't receive one) so I'm not sure what there was to offer. I was hoping to get a house drink but it didn't pan out that way.  My soup was good. I asked for the tortilla soup. It's not a broth soup- so be warned. More like a chunky stew. My partners soup was even thicker. He loved the flavor but wished it wasn't as thick as real mash potatoes.  We ordered a pepperoni pizza. It's enough to share or eat for one person. It was good. It's difficult to mess up pizza though. I ordered the tequila chicken pasta. The presentation was great! I actually have had this meal before. I still enjoyed it as much as last time I had it.   Due to our service being slow, watching some of the other staffs mannerisms (toothpicks in their mouths while handling food, or gossiping about their last tables); it just wasn't the best experience. I was embarrassed that I even suggested this place due to the long wait time on slow Saturday night. I do still intend to stop by for lunch or maybe order to go if I'm ever in the mood or area. The food is good. Just don't expect much from the staff here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-antonio,3.64,3.64,3.64,,3.6400000000000006

I went to the female manager and she said ""well, all these customers left at the same time. Also, we only have one busboy on duty"". When I looked around there was NO busboy around. I waited about two more minutes and when nobody STILL came out to clear the tables, I told the hostess I was leaving. The hostess knew why I was leaving and said nothing.

Met a few friends for lunch here, as they knew we were all trying to do low carb and she really likes their salads.  I got the Roasted Veggie Salad, and added grilled chicken. The grilled chicken was a good portion size of the salad, the roasted veggies were slim pickings. I changed the dressing to their champagne vinaigrette, which I cannot complain about. That dressing was amazing. The salad comes to you, and you think ""Wow! I am so glad I ordered the half size."" You finish the salad...and your still hungry, unfortunately. Its like they ""fluff it"" to make it look like a lot of food, but in reality, its not. My friend got the Moroccan-Spiced Chicken Salad. Chicken is in the title.. there was maybe 4 pieces of bite sized chicken in her salad.  Very disappointing.. The service was good.

They also serve a variety of appetizers, pastas, salads, soups and other main course dishes. But my mom and I wanted to try out their pizzas. Our waitress was fast and prompt with our service. We didn't even need to ask for drink refills. She just brought us more glasses of our lemonade when she noticed we were getting near the end of our drink. I always appreciate that. While we waited for our food, we were served with bread and dipping oil. The oil was a bit bland considering it had the herbs in it. The bread however was great! My mom ordered the Sicilian pizza and I ordered the Pepperoni, mushrooms, and Italian Sausage pizza. Both came with 6 slices each but we wanted to try each other's dishes. Both were delicious and full of flavor, especially with the fresh basil. The crust on the pizza was cooked to perfection with that perfect crunch you'd expect from an wood fire oven.

I called CPK who pushed the blame on the 3rd party. The manager on duty that night suggested next time to contact CPK directly and there wouldn't be any issues. Last night I called in our curbside order at 6:19 pm and was told curbside would be ready at 6:40. I arrived at 6:40, called the number 4 times to let them know I was outside waiting. I left the restaurant parking lot at 7:13 without food only an excuse from the Manager. The ladies answering the phone in the call center couldn't explain and the Manager couldn't explain why food to go is such an ordeal with CPK.

My water glass sat empty half of the time I spent there. About 40 minutes after ordering our food came, but it was the wrong order. My sons cheese pizza was correct but cold. Not even kinda warm. Then he brought the food out again.... cold and once again not what we ordered. I had to leave seeing that I was on my lunch hour. So no lunch today. At 8 months pregnant I REALLY wanted lunch! I had to leave but my other half waited for their food to be remade and we did get a gift card for the issues.

So second visit to California pizza place was way better. Staff was friendly as before. I did order mushroom pasta dish and it is outstanding. If I could I would eat it everyday. Haha. Again I didn't order pizza for myself even though that's what they are famous for. Also I did order same appetizer as before just because it was delicious and want to try it again.

Want pasta, go to any dozen or more places that do pasta. You want pizza and she wants pasta -- again, better options are available, and probably at better prices. California Pizza Kitchen excels at nothing. I'm pretty sure that the $16 Sicilian thin-crust I ate didn't come with cheese. However, the crust was crunchy. The meats tasted fine, but the chewing... God, the chewing... IS this what it's like to be in the Nathan's hotdog eating contest at Coney Island on the 4th of July?  My wife's pasta started out great but soon coagulated into a 1 pound lump of dough. She liked the taste of it and the shrimp was nicely prepared, but washing it down was an effort she said.  Overall, if you're looking for some eclectic ""Thai pizza"" or something, you're in luck. If you're just a regular pizza lover, give this place a pass.

Then we got our meals finished those and then ordered a butter cake (LITERALLY SO GOOD 100/10 RECOMMEND) then we finish pretty much the whole thing before he comes back and he goes ""oh how was it?"" And we go ""really good"" and he goes ""ya I can tell y'all almost finished it"" like in a disgusted tone it was so rude.
