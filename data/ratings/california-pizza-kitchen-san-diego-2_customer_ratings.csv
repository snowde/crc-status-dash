117,Angelo F.,"Chula Vista, CA",1831,466,1596.0,4.0,2012-01-08,"So this is a first time visit to a CPK.  I normally have low expectations when it comes to trendy pizza restaurants.  I prefer the smaller places and mom/pop pizza joints to be honest.  My friends recommended I try the BBQ Chicken Pizza.... To my surprise, it seemed like everyone around us was also ordering the same thing.  Now, I like my pizza pretty standard with tomato sauce, unless Im eating a white pizza.  But the tangy BBQ sauce along with the chicken was pretty dang tasty!  I can see how this can be a crave.   Pricing was cheaper than what I expected so this was a huge plus.  This CPK was very clean and service was on point.   Definitely going to explore CPK as an option in the future.... Im actually craving their BBQ Chicken Pizza now!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego-2?start=120,3.28,3.28,3.28,3.088,3.2800000000000002

Put some grilled chicken on top of the salad and you're good to go. Get the side of bread so you can sop up the remainig dressing. My fiance and his mom love the salads here too.

I mean, when I was in high school, I think we probably kept the one in the Natick Mall open. Nothing like huge pieces of bread with a whole pad of butter on top. ... and then pizza... and then dessert... On a rainy Saturday night, the Carmel Mtn location was packed. But we found seats at the bar to pass the 30 mins. I ordered a strawberry margarita. It was blended (awesomeee). The bartender gave me a huge glass for it, AND he gave me all the leftovers in another glass. Basically got 2 drinks for one. Then, through dinner, I had two more. So sue me! Awesome bartender. Thanks, man! He was kinda cute, too... drink prices are great here, also. Cuz it's the boonies? I dunno. I had the BLT pizza. Because I ALWAYS have the BLT pizza. Except when I'm skinny. Which is clearly not now. So. I had the BLT pizza. AMAZEBALLS.  At the bar, I noticed a picture of a slice of Red Velvet cake on the front of the dessert menu. I thought... they must be lying. It's a fake out. Well.. I clearly hadn't eaten enough after all the bread and all the blended marg and all the pizza, so.. I asked. Do  they really have Red Velvet cake? Oh yea, they sure do. And it's GOOD.  The Red Velvet is not made in-house. They get it from a distrubutor. The best part is.. you can order a whole cake THROUGH CPK to take home. Not kidding! CPK, keep it up.

167,Andrew M.,"Pacifica, CA",82,145,292.0,4.0,2012-03-26,"When do you give someone another chance? After two years!  Yes, I ventured back into the Carmel Mountain CPK after turning my back over two years ago. This time it was different because of a great host/server from Missouri named Jeff, a real southern gentleman, soft-spoken, smiling guy who made all the difference.  Not only did he make frequent trips to our booth, checking on us, he also gave us space when needed.  But, above all, he talked nice and his voice had a genuine tone of kindness and caring timbre! Also, that being a Sunday night, and the restaurant not spilling with humanity, made a difference in the kitchen.  Our BBQ Chicken pizza had a sweet barbecue flavored chicken cubes and red onion on soft bread,  yummy as we would have expected.  The kitchen could, however, have used a little bit more cilantro; the few cilantro bits were okay for the presentation, but failed to do much for for the taste buds!  My kids had a Cheese and a Pepperoni--the usual.   My Sam Adam paired well with my pizza dinner which we topped later with a Brownie with a dollop of cream on top (for my kids), Vanilla ice cream and a Red Velvet cake.  I'm stuffed! This time was ""now"" and so different from ""then."" ""Then"" was the time, a time over two years ago, when the server was an uninterested local teen, the pizza had rubber pieces for chicken, and it took ages to get water or give order, or get food.  Yes, it was then.  The experience meter had dipped so low into the basement that I could not bother myself to write for one star.  It was then!

I had a gift card to this place, so I figured I would try it out again, this time for takeout. I ordered online, and there was a deal for a free small plate registering for their loyalty program. I registered and printed out the offer. When I got there, there were two people in front of me and one takeout register. The first person was doing a bunch of scratchers with the cashier for 5 minutes. The 2nd person had all these questions about the loyalty program and the CPK app that took 10 minutes, and then she left when her table was ready. W.T.F.  Finally it was my turn. I handed the cashier my coupon for the free small plate, she got my order ready, then I paid and left. I look at the receipt, and the cost was $5 more than I thought it would be. I realized she had forgotten to deduct the small plate, so I went back in. Only the takeout cashier could help me, so I had to wait for her once again. By that time there were 3 new people there, but they were nice enough to let me go back to the front. When I asked the cashier about the free small plate, she was a bit annoyed (and probably stressed from the number of waiting people) and told me I needed the printout. I told her it was the first thing I gave her. She looked around and found it, rang up the register and gave me $3.81. I showed her the receipt that the small plate was $5. Confused, she did something on the register and gave me the right amount.  When I got home, I found that the small plate was ridiculously small, as were the pizzas. I had also asked for bread for 4, and I got 3 small slices of bread. I guess this is what the disciples felt like when they had to feed the 5,000. Taste wise everything was fine, but value-wise it was awful.

I decided to try something new for Veteran's Day (I could get a free pizza for being in the National Guard) and ordered the Pear and Gorgonzola thin crust pizza. Although I was a little weary of the pears because I'm not usually a fan of fruit on pizza but they weren't too overpowering and they complemented the pizza well. When the pizza arrived, it looked like a pizza with a salad on top. This surprised me but the salad was a touch and I gobbled up the arugula with gorgonzola salad quickly. After I finished my surprise salad, I started on the delicious pizza. Along with the pear, it was topped with caramelized onions, hazelnuts and gorgonzola.

As I had been snacking at all the previous restaurants, I wanted something light and decided to try the Crispy Mac and Cheese off the small plates menu. Unfortunately, this dish was not what I was expecting. I thought it would be a small bowl of mac and cheese with the panko crust on the top for a bit of crunch. I didn't expect it to be fried mac and cheese bites. There was way too much breading and not enough mac and cheese. In fact, the bites seemed rather dry and desperately needed more cheese sauce. I managed to eat one before being overwhelmed by the breading and decided to get the rest to go for my boyfriend to eat. At least the dish was under $4 but it wasn't even worth that.

I have no idea when or why this became a part of who I am but nowadays I only talk to people who cannot text. Hate the phone otherwise. Anyway I put my order in early in the morning.

Usually it would be no big deal, but when I am bringing food to a hungry account with a limited time to feed them and do my thang I get a little anxious.  In all they were about ten to 15 mins late no biggie. Still if you need an order on time then make sure you put it in for pick up early. I got a large pasta order. It leaked all over. Sorta lame because I took great care in delivering it. The food was good and I think you get about what you pay for. I like that they include two huge salads. The desert plate is just cookies and brownies. Nothing to get hyped over. My account enjoyed the food. They did not enjoy the mess it made.

If you love cobb salad, this is the best it's gonna get.  Take the beets on, they're good for you. Another salad winner is the roasted veggie. Add on the salmon or chicken and eat this up. My son loves the thin crusted sicilian. What can I say? He's a meat eater. The pasta is not too shabby either.  Tequila fettuccine or pesto cream penne with sun-dried tomatoes keeps me coming back for more...yum yum yum! The butter cake is divine and should be shared with a loved one!  The salted caramel is tasty too, you're gonna want to steal one or two spoonfuls of this heaven. Here's a few tips to enjoy your experience. 1) Eat off hours.  Yeah it gets packed at dinner, so if you need your CPK fix eat an early dinner at 4. 2) If you have a small party of 2 and it's packed, jump at the seats on the bar.  The service is faster and better! 3) It's CPK. The P stands for Pizza.  If you want Mexican carnitas or chile relleno, you should probably head over to a Mexican restaurant. If the customer is always right, then be the right customer!

Start off with a soup, this time split pea and half a Chinese chicken, all to share for a family of 2 adults and 2 kids and a baby who is starting to eat, so she gets the sauceless chicken from salad and some soup.  The only food complaint was that the salad looked smaller than usual, a bit wilted, but sparingly dressed the way a salad should be.  The service was as usual, off.

It wasn't too busy, but he had to be asked multiple times for things, silverware and napkins, and he turned around mid way out the kitchen to dish up soup to be sever with our salad, no big deal, apologized and forgiven.  Food came in timely manner from a runner and we were offered cheese and red pepper for our dinner which we accepted.  Halfway through the piccata, I toss the remaining pasta into sauce for distribution and a black, curly, ugly hair popped out, gross, I almost threw up in my mouth. We waived down the waiter, he immediately got the manager, she apologized, removed the item from bill, offered to make another, to eat now or pack for later, never making excuses. I kindly declined and she went further to offer dessert, I looked at my family to see if they were interested as I was no longer interested in eating, but she left the menu, told us to think it over and to let our waiter know. All very kind and all very professional and I have zero complaints about the way the situation was handled. Zero. The kids ended up deciding on the red velvet cake, it was ok, I make better. But all in all, it's too bad that I will mentally need to get over the hair thing before I can return, probably will be inspecting every bite for a while when I finally allow myself to return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego-2?start=220,3.96,3.32,3.32,3.2440000000000007,3.576

When we arrived at 6pm we were told we were just waiting for some patrons that had already paid to leave. 6:10....6:15....6:35...FINALLY, we were seated not at the table we were waiting for but another one in the rear corner.  It's a ""tough"" business because you can't simply ask guests to leave their table because another party is waiting. What made it difficult for me was the fact that we made reservations for 6pm, we had someone that needed to leave at 7 and most importantly it was a birthday celebration. I could sense that the manager tonight wanted to make things right and was apologetic for the situation. Shortly after we sat, we've received multiple appetizers for the entire table in inconvenience for our wait. I really appreciated the gesture and hope that anyone who reads this, will treat all people with kindness and patience.

Then we waited....Sarah, our server, refilled our tea after a few minutes, and then disappeared. After about 30 minutes, we flagged down the manager and asked where our food was; he apologized and said there was a problem with their ticket printer and ours got lost. He said they were making our order and it would be out in a couple minutes. My husband said not to rush it, just make it right. No problem! The shrimp on my dish was not cooked completely, so they had to remake my meal...the manager apologized and said he would comp our meal and offered a free dessert. Nice, but by this point it had been an hour, and we were just done. Oh and Sarah?

Accommodation: it has become the hub of family gatherings with big groups of kids (teams, etc). and as expected, boisterous, loud combo of kids squealing + adult laughters just fills the air. Service: it depends on who you get. Hope a veteran wait staff will get your order as it will be efficient and precise, drinks filled automatically.

I got there around 6pm.  Asked for a table for 3.  A gentleman walked me all the way to the very end, to a table in the very far right corner where you are covered and its very private.  I asked to be moved to the main area and to be around people.  He took me over to a booth that was empty, but needed to be cleaned, as dirty dishes were still on the table. I sat down. Someone came over and took the dirty dishes away.   Our waiter came over and asked me for my drink order.  I asked him to please have someone wipe the table as it was used by someone before me and had dirty forks and dishes on it.  Here is the KICKER!!! He bend down and started looking at the table.  He was actually looking to see if the table was dirty!!! Really?  Anyhow, he came back with a towel.  Wiped it 1/2 way in the middle.

Service sucked and we were also not impressed with the food this time. Now that my baby is eating restaurant food we started ordering kid meals when we go out. We went there on a Sunday little past the regular lunch hour (maybe around 1:45pm). First the service: We were seated by the hostess and sat there for maybe like 10+ minutes before I asked some random server/supervisor that we want to order some food (my daughter was hungry). He asked if anyone showed up to greet and take our order, I said no they did not. That guy talked to a couple of ladies at the billing desk a table away from mine, one of those ladies was our server. Our server was neither smiling nor welcoming (not sure if it was because we asked for someone to take our order instead of waiting indefinitely). She seemed overworked (which is usually the trend we noticed at CPK) and too busy to greet and make proper eye contact. I ordered kids Mac&Cheese, water and the usual bread they serve. I requested the kids meal be brought out ASAP. I said I'll order the entree's when she brings the M&C out. We got water immediately and bread in a short while but it was a while before the M&C was out. Now the food: Turns out Mac & Cheese (on the kids menu) sucks at CPK!! It was not the traditional or classic Macaroni, they made it with the fusilli (thick curly pasta). Pasta was half cooked and absolutely dry with no visible cream or cheese. This is what you serve for kids? We tried to feed that dry half cooked pasta to my daughter but she did not like it.  After a little while we could get hold of our server and I asked for extra cheese and cream to be brought out, which took a while again to come out. My Pizza, Wife's salad and soup came out fine and were good (they usually are) including the substitutes we requested.

So I ordered the $14 Thai chicken pizza, Brother had the $14 barbecue chicken sandwich, Sis-in-law had the $14 classic crispy chicken sandwich, Wee One had the $5.50 kids Hawaiian Pizza, and I grabbed a $14 cheese and tomato pizza home for Hubs. The Thai chicken pizza had very little peanut sauce so it was very dry, had even less chicken, and had a mountain of carrots, bean sprouts and scallions. I like vegetable as much as the next person (and probably more) but when it is 90% of the pizza, it is a bit ridiculous. And it is definitely something you can eat on your own. The BBQ chicken sandwich did not taste like Bbq at all. It was mushy chicken and even mushier fried onions. Both sandwiches decided to have the farmers market soup as a side and it was awful. The flavor was very similar to the spicy chowder type soups they sell in cans at the supermarket. It had chunks of raw veggies (they claimed to be roasted, but I am not buying that...) and a ""drizzle"" of olive oil on top that would probably be more adequately described as an ""oil spill/ecological disaster"" of olive oil on top. Seriously, we thought BP had been through the kitchens (Too soon?). The crispy chicken had a tiny piece of chicken in a huge square roll (because they think chicken is square?) so only the middle had chicken in it. Most of the sanwiches was just dry bread with lettuce and a ton of mayo oozing everywhere (See picture). Wee One's kid-sized pizza was the most appropriately priced but clearly the people who designed the kids menu items have no idea what ACTUALLY children are like. The ham was thinly sliced, but it was in huge pieces so W.O. kept choking on it. I had the take all the pieces off, tear them into edible non-choky chunks and then put them back on. The pineapple was also super huge chunks that had to be torn into smaller pieces for kid-sized mouths. The pineapple had a lot of the outer bits still on it like when you don't cut enough of the rind off, which is a bit irritating in a pizza. W.O. also asked for a refill on his chocolate milk and had to keep waiting and waiting. Not sure why it took 5 minutes to get a refill on chocolate milk when our server came up twice to say ""the chocolate milk will be right up"". The take home pizza was fine with the proportions and flavors, but still really expensive for a dinner plate-sized pizza. All together, including tip, this meal came to $80!!! Overall, I think California should petition to have the name changed so this restaurant doesn't sully California's name. I will never be returning to this place when the pizza at Little Caesars tasted similar to this ""gourmet"" crap and was twice the size for a third of the price. And doesn't choke toddlers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego-2,2.68,3.44,3.44,2.8200000000000003,3.1360000000000006

7,Daniel L.,"San Diego, CA",301,112,86.0,5.0,2017-10-31,This is one of my favorite pizza places of all time. You can't go wrong with anything here but def try adding an egg on your pizza as it really brings out the flavor. If you decide to get salad the bbq chicken salad is literally my favorite salad ever. Pro tip order the pita bread here it's only a dollar you get a bunch of it and it's as delicious as pizza. My last experience here they got my pizza order completely wrong and not only did they change they redo it they let me keep the original pizza for free. If you're looking for some great customer service I don't think you can go wrong with this place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego-2,3.88,3.39,3.424,,3.5860000000000003

Their pita bread is delicious and the pizza was great as well. They messed up my boyfriends order but they immediately made him a new pizza for free. Their customer service was fantastic, and I definitely look forward to coming back again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego-2,3.96,3.39,3.428,,3.6180000000000003
13,Margaret D.,"San Diego, CA",130,123,137.0,1.0,2017-11-14,"For some reason this was a bad lunch choice all around.  The parking lot was being re-paved surrounding this restaurant.  I ended up having to park across a very busy street and walk to the restaurant.  There was a large lunch crowd and we had to wait fifteen minutes to be seated.  We were told this up front and we were ok with the wait since our car was so far away.  We were finally seated at a nice booth and had our drinks served promptly.  We started with an appetizer, the white corn guacamole and chips for $5.  When it arrived my lunch companion and I were both hugely disappointed as it was a one cup serving of some cubed avocado, but it mostly consisted of corn and beans.  There was so much filler and barely any guacamole that we really felt ripped off.  Also there was a handful of chips, I think this could have been a much bigger serving.  We then split the Thai Chicken pizza, which was not as tasty as I imagined it would be.  There wasn't much chicken on there and we were both still hungry and so we rolled the dice to see if the dessert would bring some happiness to our lunch.  We ordered the Salted Carmel Pudding since most of the other desserts charged extra for the ice cream that was pictured in the desserts and when you added up the price we didn't think ordering them made much sense.  When our salted carmel pudding arrived with two spoons we laughed because the glass dish you could see there was about an inch of pudding in the glass and the rest was filled with whipped cream.  After dessert my friend and I decided that we would never come back to California Pizza Kitchen again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego-2,3.8,3.36,3.416,,3.536

When I got there around 3p. the hiring manager CHRISTIAN saw me and all of a sudden they were not in need of a dishwasher anymore. I had my food handlers certificate  and my non slip shoes on hand with 4 years of experience... He shot me down with no hand shake, just walked away so i left. Not even 3 minutes I went back in to retrieve my  application. Yep you know it! It was in the trash can. I walked out the door with my head up but I knew I had the wrong paint job...

See the attached photos.  Absolutely disgusting.  If you look up, the air duct vents are caked with dust.  This location needs a remodel.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego-2,3.68,3.31,3.416,,3.458
9,M P.,"San Diego, CA",0,4,,3.0,2017-12-18,"I've been to the Carmel Mt. CPK many times and mostly it is a fine and delicious experience.  The servers are always friendly and aim to please.   I will continue to patronize this CPK - because there are times when I absolutely must have a particular menu item and because it's only 5 minutes from home. There are two issues that irk me, however. They have discontinued the Moroccan Salad and the Chinese Chicken Salad.  Why??!!!! And.  Their rewards program leaves much to be desired.  Not only does just ONE person receive rewards credit from a party of two or more at the table - somehow this seems odd and unfair - but twice to date the server has assured us that the check amount would be posted to the rewards account, but that was not the case.  Nothing was posted. CPK almost never has ""specials"" and discounts, and I was hoping that the rewards deal would give a bit of a break.  It seems that this is not necessarily the case.  They could do better!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego-2,3.6,3.29,3.424,,3.414
1,Hayley A.,"San Diego, CA",68,20,16.0,1.0,2017-12-20,What has happened to CPK? I ordered a Waldorf salad (half size) which was $13! Yikes! There was barely any lettuce in it at all and so many apples and grapes. So basically I ordered the worlds smallest fruit salad for $13. So I wondered what a full size salad cost = $16.29.  I'm pretty sure I will never return to a cpk again. There are so many other places to grab a pizza and salad for a decent price.  I wish I took a pic of that fruit salad - it was so depressing in its little to go container.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego-2,3.44,3.25,3.424,,3.326

They are dog friendly (on the patio) and the service is great. We had Michele today and she was the sweetest! She gave us great service and she loved our dog, so that was a plus too! The food here is amazing to say the least. Today I got tke cucumber Revitalizer beverage and it was SO GOOD and super refreshing! They are not complimentary refills though - FYI. I got 2 because they were so good. Their spicy cauliflower appetizer is what I crave the most!
