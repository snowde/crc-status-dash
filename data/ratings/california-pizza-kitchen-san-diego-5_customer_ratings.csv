13,Alex L.,"Costa Mesa, CA",258,204,145.0,2.0,2012-12-11,"It's 10:30 PM on a weekday night. Do you know where your kids are?  Hopefully in a gang because if they're in Terminal 2 of the San Diego International Airport they might be duped into paying $12 for a small and pitiful looking pizza.  Or worse, they'll have paid $10 for a pre-made boxed salad like I did.   Complaining about airport food and prices is a rookie move, I know.  Even the youngest child understands that once you step foot into a sky harbour, you're basically entering a different country where the outside laws of supply and demand have been shifted toward robber baron monopolies.  Forget your dollar menus and deals; your are in Their domain now.  And you.  Will.  Pay. The aforementioned pizza?  A basic pepperoni heated up in their fake-wood fired oven.  Cheese was burnt but still chewy.  The crust had a slight crisp to it without being soft over hardened into stone.  It's edible with the price being the only part that's hard to swallow. At least the pizza had a price unlike the Cobb salad.  Rows of clear plastic to-go boxes brimming with lettuce and the promise of healthy eating sat sparkling in the cold fluorescent light of the cold case.  ""How much would this salad go for?"" I wondered, lifting the first salad within reach.  Not seeing any noticeable price on the label, I flipped it over and found the bar code.  Hmmm...  I hate it when convenience stores pull these tricks and was extra disappointed when the menu above made no mention of my salad.  Oh well, I need the veggies so what's a boy to do?  As I handed over my credit card and was given a receipt in return, I turned to my friends and let them know my lettuce box was $9.99.  Tellingly, the cashier nodded sympathetically at my comment. The actual salad was better than the crap ones sold at most grocery stores and probably better than the ones I'm used to getting at Trader Joe's.  But at 3 times the price it better have been. My lack of planning and associated laziness were the main contributors to my situation of eating an airport dinner before a red-eye flight.  I deserved what I got, but will stop at an In-and-Out next time before I get to the airport.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego-5,,,,,

14,Jim S.,"Deerfield Beach, FL",2,25,,2.0,2014-05-14,Not anywhere near as good as a real CPK. Pizza was not good. Agree with other yelp ers,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego-5,,,,,
17,amy h.,"San Marcos, CA",0,46,3.0,1.0,2014-07-31,Gross and overpriced. $10 for a small salad?! They only had 3 flavors of pizza left so I had to get the margarita which normally would be ok. Except it was like bread loaded with gross cheese. Not worth it even though we were starving.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego-5,,,,,
7,Neel K.,"Beloit, WI",71,334,352.0,2.0,2014-09-21,"I truly love CPK despite the fact that it is a chair restaurant. This location disappoints me. To start with they are rude and unwilling to customize anything. I merely asked for jalapeño or peppers and they refused. They would not even offer crushed red pepper. The pizza selection is limited and the Thai chicken is missing. They have some salads and pre-made sandwiches.  I ended up getting a BBQ pizza which was very mediocare.  I don't know how they screwed it up, but it for some reason wasn't as good as made at other locations. Overall, if you are really jonesing for a pizza it will do in a fix, but don't expect the same quality you would get at other CPK locaitons",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego-5,,,,,
11,Garett A.,"Las Vegas, NV",97,339,265.0,3.0,2014-11-19,"Stopped at the kiosk to grab a bite just prior to catching a flight. There were no prices posted and nothing was marked. I opted for the white albacore tuna sandwich. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the sandwich. Outside of the inflated airport price (nearly eleven bucks), it was a good, tasty sandwich with fresh tomato and lettuce. I could have saved a few bucks by eating before hand, but was running late and wasn't sure if I would make it in time for departure. It was quick and a nice alternative to some of the other airport options. I would do it again, but only in a pinch. Eleven bucks is a little much for a sandwich, but it's nice to know you have options near the gate when running late.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego-5,,,,,
12,John L.,"Chula Vista, CA",509,280,612.0,5.0,2014-12-10,"I've had breakfast here a few times now and this place is really good. Airport prices means it gets dinged a bit by reviewers but all in all, the food is good (best at terminal 2 in my opinion) and the people behind the counter are friendly and provide good service. What more do you want at an airport?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego-5,,,,,
10,Keith F.,"Gulf Breeze, FL",601,18,20.0,3.0,2015-11-16,"Service fine, pizza hot, a little  over cooked. Ask for a fork because the place to sit is a little ways away from kiosk",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego-5,,,,,
6,Craig D.,"Devon, PA",12,1190,12.0,4.0,2016-01-21,"(4) ~ very good pizza & service.  Notes:  It's Take-out only, so no seating.  Pizzas take about 10 minutes to make.  And Breakfast ends at 10:00 am. HIGHLIGHTS: **Denver Breakfast Pizza = (4) very good for airport food.  Might try the other Breakfast Pizzas next time.  Note: They do use scrambled eggs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego-5,,,,,
2,Rebecca T.,"Carlsbad, CA",666,806,3605.0,4.0,2016-02-14,"This is probably one of the few eateries within the airport where you can get freshly made food. Some people complained about the wait, but this is not Blaze or Pieology so don't whine about the wait time if you want fresh oven pizza. There's Panda Express next door and some sandwiches you can grab to go. That being said, the wait is 10-15 mins so make sure you have at least 30 mins of downtime before you decide to go for it.  However, I do feel sorry for those who have to wait in line for the grab and go items. They should have at least 2 cash registers to accommodate that. When I was there, only one guy was tending the register and the other at the back making pizzas.  It's so great to have fresh crispy hot pizza, real food, at the San Diego airport. I got the new mushroom and cheese pizza and it's delicious. Although $12.99 is not a cheap price, I think it's still worth it when you're super hungry and not knowing when your next meal was going to be. Also they don't have the full menu, so don't expect it to be a full CPK. It's more like a CPK Express.  The location is near Gate 25.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego-5,,,,,
5,Joseph Y.,"La Mesa, CA",376,1059,4606.0,2.0,2016-02-20,"About five years ago before the San Diego Airport decided to upgrade its food and shopping areas of terminal 2, you could find California Pizza Kitchen pretty much in every terminal behind security lines. Now it's isolated to the area behind terminal 2 east sterile area. Sometimes I'm stuck working at the airport for my job and I've never really wanted to really try CPK because their prices seemed really high to begin with. When flying out an early morning to Phoenix, I had to get some food into me before climbing onto the plane. CPK and only two other places were the only ones open so early in T2East. I made the mistake of giving them a shot instead of just grabbing a muffin. Their breakfast burrito wrap sounded pretty good. I wanted to skip the tortilla because I thought I'd get more eggs and stuff without it being wrapped up. So I asked them to make me a bowl instead. Well that plan kind of back fired on me because it seemed like they gave me even less and the cheese kind of melted all over the plate. My first clue to my food not tasting good is when I saw them throwing everyone's order into the microwave instead of having fresh food.  The breakfast burrito ( ) consisted of eggs, black beans, sasuage, cheese, onions and mozzarella cheese. I guess since they make pizza, mozzarella was the only thing lying around. The meal tasted quite bad because the everything was essentially heated up in the microwave and nothing was fresh at all. The eggs themselves had a bad rubbery texture and the cheese didn't even taste good. The sausage looked like something you'd get out of a box in the frozen breakfast department at a grocery store. None the less I was really hungry and after spending $7 on my food, I was determined to make this work for a breakfast. I don't suggest eating here though. Even though I'm not the biggest fan of Jack in The Box, at least their food isn't microwaved up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego-5,,,,,
4,Natalie M.,"San Francisco, CA",301,502,368.0,3.0,2016-08-03,"The pizza is good. I love CPK. I got the BBQ chicken pizza. Pretty bomb. It's my fave but mannnnn the service here was super questionable, food safety-wise. Workers used gloves to clean counter top with gloves/sanitizer and then wouldn't wash hands before handling food. I basically still ate it lol but watched the violations ensue. I will update if anything happens with my system Haha. They were nice but an awkward bunch for sure. They need some food safety training and regulation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego-5,,,,,

3,Justin A.,"La Jolla, CA",376,152,285.0,3.0,2017-04-02,"I had a flight at 11, and I wanted to get a bite to eat beforehand so I decided on a sausage and bacon breakfast pizza. Not too bad! The sausage and bacon are all I really wanted.
