141,Rachel E.,"Hillcrest, San Diego, CA",83,49,9.0,2.0,2013-02-19,"Went to CPK for a birthday celebration. I was pretty satisfied with the food and drink, but the environment and service were lacking a lot of luster. PROS: Will do separate checks for a large group, Food was good (4 out of 5), the roasted veggie salad was a nice alternative to boring, plain, or fatty salads you usually find at restaurants these days.  CONS: Service was inconsistent, we got our food after the rest of our party was basically done eating theirs. Also, it's in a mall (which I try to avoid).  And it was crowded and we were sat late, even with reservations.  --------------------------------- DRINK:  I was in the mood for a beer, but there weren't any great selections - I think they had three beers on tap; Red Trolley was one, but none of them made me even a little excited.  The birthday guest's drink of choice is always a Long Island Iced Tea, so I had one of those as well.  Always a good choice if you think a corporate place isn't going to pour the drinks well, because it's pretty much all alcohol.  It was a decent drink, though the bartender didn't add enough ice so she topped it off with coke (it's supposed to be the smallest of splashes).  But, at $8, it was a good choice (I was honestly expecting $10 or $12). GROUPS: Even though we had reservations at 7:00 for 8, we weren't seated until 7:30. The upside of going to this place as a group is that they'll do separate checks, so you don't have to split the bill at the end.  The downside is that they still charged us the group rate for gratuity (18%).  I typically tip 18-20% for good and great service, but I didn't want to give them an 18% tip after that visit. FOOD: The food was good, Shawn got the Carnitas & Habanero pizza, and I had the roasted veggie half salad.  A half salad is just right for the standard person (girl) - get a full salad if you plan on sharing with someone.  The roasted veggies were done well - eggplant, peppers, artichoke hearts - and also avocado and a few other things.  Pretty tasty!  Shawn said the pizza was good too.  He and his brother love spicy food, and the pizza came with a habanero salsa/dipping sauce, which they said was pretty good (and actually on the spicy side.) SERVICE: The biggest negative of the night was that all the food came out for everyone else in our group, and Shawn Michael and I did not receive our food.  The server came back around and apologized to us, said there was a mix-up in the kitchen and that it was all her fault, and that our food would be out soon.  My salad was delivered at about the point when everyone else was halfway through their food, and Shawn's pizza came after everyone else had finished their meals (and I was nearly done with my salad).  We're pretty patient people, and recognize that mistakes are made, and for the most part are pretty forgiving.  The food was still good; he enjoyed his pizza and I my salad, but when a server admits that it was totally their fault, that they messed the order up, I expect the best approach is to take a portion of the price off the bill, or comp a drink or bring a free appetizer or something.  Shawn and I were both surprised when our check came and it was still full priced (and had the mandatory 18% gratuity included).   We weren't expecting it for free, because we still benefited from eating and enjoying the meal, but the server should account for the inconvenience and the inaccuracy of their service.  For Shawn's sake I wanted to say something, or at least tip a little bit less, but he didn't want to make it into a big deal so we ended up just paying the bill and leaving.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=280,3.68,3.31,3.312,2.6640000000000006,3.458

I ordered a salad and pizza online for pick up, and it was ready to go at the agreed upon time. The food itself was okay, but surely not worth the $29.00 plus price. I figure for $30.00 you could buy two large pizzas and two rotisserie chickens at Costco down the street and feast for a few days. But the WORST part was looking over the take out counter and noticing how dirty the phone, fax machine and credit card reader were! It grossed me out to think that the very nice young man who was preparing my order had been touching that grime prior to bagging up my food. It wouldn't take much to get a cleaning rag and small brush from the kitchen and clean the machines and phone once in awhile! Maybe most customers don't notice such details, but I always do. I think a letter to the manager is in order, just to point it out, as I'm sure he's unaware of the grime.

The pizza, so amazing. they brought back my favorite, the garlic chicken pizza (YES!) and I love the pear Gorgonzola also. oh and the thai.....my bf likes the works, thin crust.  what surprises me , is the other foods on the menu are very very good. my picks are, The chicken ceaser salad, quinoa and asparagus salad add chicken , fish tacos (they are good trust me) , the pork tacos (a little spicy) and the chips and salsa. the salsa is good! the hummus app is good,, on the healthy menu the salmon and the chicken chimichurri   are delicious and light., and lastly pretty much every salad.  what I didn't like, the avocado rolls (they taste like bacon, and it should mention they have that in there, vegetarians beware of this-my brother wasn't happy with that surprise) , the mac and cheese bites (fried greasy mess of cheese) and the pasta isn't anything spectacular , actually get anything but the pastas....

It consists of chicken, shrimp, and crawfish with sausage & ham with spicy Cajun sauce (it's not spicy where you can't eat it). This is large enough to share between two people, but of course if you both are hungry I would definitely order another dish to share as well.  We also ordered the California Cobb salad which was really delicious for a salad! This salad has smoked bacon(yum!) , eggs, basil, herb with a choice of ranch or bleu cheese dressing.

First, let me say, our server Colby was awesome.  He was fast, courteous and responsive. Shortly after we ordered our food, we noticed that there was a stream of ants crawling across the windowsill which was really really dirty.  This windowsill looked as if it had not been cleaned in weeks.  There were literally dead insects on the windowsill covered in dust in addition to the ants.  As soon as we noticed the ants, we asked if we could move, and Colby was super in accommodating us and helping us get moved to our new table. After we moved, someone came and reset the two person booth that we had just left.  They then proceeded to seat another couple at the booth.  We were confused because we noticed that the windowsill had not actually been cleaned.  After a few minutes, those people also requested to be moved.  Even after both parties mentioned the ants, no one came and cleaned the booth windowsill.  We had to sit at the table nearby the whole time, knowing that the ants were still running wild. While Colby did an excellent job accommodating us and serving us, at no time did a manager come to speak with us or apologize.  Nor did anyone do the same for the other party who had to be moved.  Additionally, as we left, we mentioned the problem to the manager standing at the host stand and still received no apology.  In fact after we mentioned in, we walked around the corner where we could still see inside and the manager never left the host station to even investigate. As always, the food was delicious.  We had the Mushroom, Sausage and Pepperoni Pizza and split the Barbecue Chicken Salad.  Both were really good, and up to par with our regular CPK experiences. And I highly recommend the Agave Mojito, it was superb.   I don't think I will ever patronize this CPK again, as it was clear that cleanliness is just not important to the staff in general.  I would probably have given this review only 1 star if it weren't for the great service from Colby.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=140,3.2,3.16,3.212,2.472,3.1760000000000006

This location in general needs a remodel.  It's in the nicest most upscale mall in SD where they now offer seasons 52, true foods, pf changs and many other great places around the same price with a much nicer look and feel to them.  The bathrooms were really dark, the tables are older and it's just not a fashion valley mall type of feeling.  I understand it's better than eating in the good court and it's next to the movie theater but all the other restaurants are no further of a walking distance.  The only positive I can say for yesterday's lunch was that they have improved their bread and it's truly delicious.  They're old bread was just plain and the butter was hard as it had just come out of the fridge but the new bread is warm, soft and it comes with a really good olive oil and seasoning dip!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=80,3.12,3.09,3.18,2.9560000000000004,3.102
552,Andee S.,"Bermuda Dunes, United States",124,105,70.0,2.0,2014-08-07,"I was so disappointed with our experience at this CPK.  One of the great things about CPK is their consistency.  However this particular location leaves much to be desired. First, let me say, our server Colby was awesome.  He was fast, courteous and responsive. Shortly after we ordered our food, we noticed that there was a stream of ants crawling across the windowsill which was really really dirty.  This windowsill looked as if it had not been cleaned in weeks.  There were literally dead insects on the windowsill covered in dust in addition to the ants.  As soon as we noticed the ants, we asked if we could move, and Colby was super in accommodating us and helping us get moved to our new table. After we moved, someone came and reset the two person booth that we had just left.  They then proceeded to seat another couple at the booth.  We were confused because we noticed that the windowsill had not actually been cleaned.  After a few minutes, those people also requested to be moved.  Even after both parties mentioned the ants, no one came and cleaned the booth windowsill.  We had to sit at the table nearby the whole time, knowing that the ants were still running wild. While Colby did an excellent job accommodating us and serving us, at no time did a manager come to speak with us or apologize.  Nor did anyone do the same for the other party who had to be moved.  Additionally, as we left, we mentioned the problem to the manager standing at the host stand and still received no apology.  In fact after we mentioned in, we walked around the corner where we could still see inside and the manager never left the host station to even investigate. As always, the food was delicious.  We had the Mushroom, Sausage and Pepperoni Pizza and split the Barbecue Chicken Salad.  Both were really good, and up to par with our regular CPK experiences. And I highly recommend the Agave Mojito, it was superb.   I don't think I will ever patronize this CPK again, as it was clear that cleanliness is just not important to the staff in general.  I would probably have given this review only 1 star if it weren't for the great service from Colby.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=140,3.08,3.07,3.184,2.9200000000000004,3.074

Hear me out on this one: The reason I found myself at CPK on a Thursday night was because my aunt was hosting a fundraiser. CPK agreed to donate 20% of our bill to the Cheetah Conservation Fund. Twenty percent is a nice chunk- I appreciated they were so generous with their percentage.  Onto the food:  My date (a.k.a. my Mom) and I agreed to split a half salad. She picked the Italian Chopped salad. Would not have been my first choice because I'm not a huge fan of salami, but man, I'm glad I let her pick. The salad was great! The salami wasn't overpowering. The salad-to-dressing ratio was on point. I guess Mom always does know best. The Chicken Tequila Fettuccine great! I usually give restaurants a ""4"" if I liked the food, and a ""5"" if I consider it ""unforgettable."" The dish had a lot of different flavors put together. I'd definitely get this again. On top of it all- our server was super friendly and not too ""sale-sy."" When he picked up on the fact that we weren't super hungry, he told us to just let him know if we wanted to look at dessert menus.

VERY DISAPPOINTED. Their cheese is great, and really ruined my dinner since I was craving THAT. Second time I ordered, they remembered this delicious cheese. But they forgot my cheese & red pepper packets (I asked for these packets, twice, to clarify they were different from the fresh cheese). They also didn't give me their ""homemade"" whipped cream on the two key lime pies I ordered. Another craving they didn't satisfy. I had to stop by a grocery store on the way home to get some whipped cream. Not the same. Couldn't even finish the pie as it's in my fridge now, two days later. I clarified with the take out order taker, twice, that I just signed up for their rewards program online and would like to use their $10 off $40 order. When I called at curbside, I confirmed my total. They did not apply my coupon. But the girl added it on quickly. The girl that brought out the food was very nice so that made me not FURIOUS about all this. Missing condiments and all. Sad.

Hear me out on this one: The reason I found myself at CPK on a Thursday night was because my aunt was hosting a fundraiser. CPK agreed to donate 20% of our bill to the Cheetah Conservation Fund. Twenty percent is a nice chunk- I appreciated they were so generous with their percentage.  Onto the food:  My date (a.k.a. my Mom) and I agreed to split a half salad. She picked the Italian Chopped salad. Would not have been my first choice because I'm not a huge fan of salami, but man, I'm glad I let her pick. The salad was great! The salami wasn't overpowering. The salad-to-dressing ratio was on point. I guess Mom always does know best. The Chicken Tequila Fettuccine great! I usually give restaurants a ""4"" if I liked the food, and a ""5"" if I consider it ""unforgettable."" The dish had a lot of different flavors put together. I'd definitely get this again. On top of it all- our server was super friendly and not too ""sale-sy."" When he picked up on the fact that we weren't super hungry, he told us to just let him know if we wanted to look at dessert menus. He didn't bring them and try and guilt us into ordering more, which I really appreciated. Overall, CPK exceeded my expectations.

I told her we had called in ahead of time and she seemed to be in disbelief. At first, she said there was no record of my calling in. But then I noticed my name on the wait list. When I pointed this out to her, she seemed skeptical, stating, ""This doesn't look like a call in."" Truly bizarre reaction and accusation. Do you not want us to patronize your mediocre restaurant? We waited quite a while after that point. Nearly 50 minutes after my call, the portly hostess calls us. She notices we have a small child and then berates us in front many other guests with words to the effect of the following: ""You should have told me you had a child. Now you will have to wait longer. A child counts as a person."" Gee whiz, what a complete failure of customer service and professionalism. At last, the portly waitress seats us but only after 25 minutes beyond the wait we were promised. On the bright side, the food was decent and the server was much more friendly and on top of things.

The blend of BBQ sauce and ranch over a mix of lettuce, tomatoes, corn, black beans and TORTILLA CHIPS is delicious! I'm not a huge meat eater so I like to substitute avocado for chicken. The California Club Sandwich-It has bacon in it. Enough said. It also comes with a soup or salad, so I always choose the Dakota Smashed Pea and Barley to add on. Thai Chicken Pizza- There was a time when they took this off the menu, but it's back and it's got such a unique flavor. It's a must try! Tostada Pizza- It's like a Mexican style salad on your pizza. The only thing is that it doesn't keep very well, so you need to finish the whole thing at the restaurant. Great for sharing! Chocolate Souflle Cake-Yes, the red velvet is to die for and the butter cake melts in your mouth, but the chocolate souflle cake will forever be the greatest dessert to every grace the pages of the CPK dessert menu.

Female who answered sounded very unwelcoming and disinterested. She quoted us 25 minutes. We got to the location a little early and checked in or at least attempted to. The portly, plain Jane hostess gave us an attitude. I told her we had called in ahead of time and she seemed to be in disbelief. At first, she said there was no record of my calling in. But then I noticed my name on the wait list. When I pointed this out to her, she seemed skeptical, stating, ""This doesn't look like a call in."" Truly bizarre reaction and accusation. Do you not want us to patronize your mediocre restaurant? We waited quite a while after that point. Nearly 50 minutes after my call, the portly hostess calls us. She notices we have a small child and then berates us in front many other guests with words to the effect of the following: ""You should have told me you had a child. Now you will have to wait longer. A child counts as a person."" Gee whiz, what a complete failure of customer service and professionalism. At last, the portly waitress seats us but only after 25 minutes beyond the wait we were promised. On the bright side, the food was decent and the server was much more friendly and on top of things. We still waited well over 30 minutes for food, however.

There are two, near where I live, so I decided to go to the Fashion Valley location because I was just leaving campus, and it was the closer option. I was given a $50 gift card to CPK, so I came in one day after a long day at school. Upon my arrival, I was promptly seated at the bar by the host. He was friendly, and gave me the option to sit at a table, but since I was all by myself, I chose the latter. I looked at the menu before I was approached by a waiter, named Renee. She took my drink order first, and I got the Caribbean Sangria, and a glass of water. I came in around noon, and the lunch special was still on so I took advantage of that.  She came back with my drinks and apologized for not having pineapple in my drinks, and I laughed and told her it was perfectly fine. She came back a couple minutes later with a plate of chopped pineapples. It was a simple gesture, but all the more appreciated. The sangria was really really delicious. I've had my fair share of sangrias, but that drink alone could keep me coming back. So with that, my first impression was already off to a great start. She took my food order, and I got the lunch special with a caesar salad and their specialty, bbq chicken pizza. After that, Renee gave me some bread while I waited, and sipped on my sangria.

No one acknowledged the issue, they all played it down. The pizza was mediocre. I left feeling hungry after having four slices. The crust was unremarkable, better than stale crackers, I guess. The mozzarella had nice flavor, but the texture was too chewy. Total lack of sauce, prepare for cottonmouth if you choose to dine here. The toppings were scarce and an afterthought.

410,Tanya A.,"San Diego, United States",52,155,290.0,4.0,2016-01-03,"Wonderful Spot at the mall for lunch/dinner + drinks! CPK @ Fashion Valley is located right by AMC and is a short walk from the top floor parking lot. They have 4 pick up parking spots reserved as well in the parking lot for guests picking up pizza! I've always had a great experience at this location. I have been here several times for lunch and several times on Friday after work for dinner. The wait is never more than 10 minutes and the servers are always responsive and take care of you very well. I usually have to ask for their complimentary bread, which is fine as i Imagine some people don't want to start their meal with bread and would rather wait for what they ordered. But the bread is delicious and super fresh, so I would recommend to ask for it :) I love their spicy chipotle chicken hand tossed pizza and i always add avacado to it. I also love the Tostada pizza which is a thin crust pizza - mexican style. It does not have traditional red sauce, but rather has a black bean base topped with lettuce, cheese, and chips. You can add chicken or another meat for an additional cost to this, but I usually stick to veggie.  The drinks are pretty great as well, good for the price and delicious.  A great tip for veggies/allergies: The CPK Website has an extremely detailed Allergen Menu which basically mentions EVERY single ingredient used in their dishes. So if you are strict vegetarian, or have any kind of allergies, you can easily lookup the dish you are interested in ordering - and it will tell you what it has. I know they have gluten free crust which attracts a lot of my co-workers, but I have never personally tried that one.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=40,3.84,3.54,3.292,2.8960000000000004,3.66

This place is located on the second level of the Fashion Valley Mall next to the foodcourt and across from the AMC Theater. They have an outdoor patio for dining and a bar inside. I've been here a few times. Each visit is a different experience. This past visit was about an hour or so before closing on New Year's Eve with my friend. After doing some well deserved shopping for ourselves after Christmas, we decided to dine here. There was no wait, so we were seated right away. Our server was friendly. She also gave me a compliment on liking my Star Wars hat. Since we were famished, we already knew what we wanted to order. She took our drink orders first. I tried their Mango flavored iced tea. It was very sweet. As I was getting ready to separate our bread plate to give to my friend, I noticed that our plates had crumbs on it. I didn't know where our server went, so we got the attention of one of the male server's. He was working in the front host area. We asked for new plates. As he took our plates away, he said he will be back with new plates. He didn't return. When our server delivered our bread, I told her about the plates. She came back with freshly washed plates that were nice and warm. We ordered their Sesame Ginger Chicken Dumplings as an  appetizer and the Wild Mushroom Pizza with Wheat  Whole Grain Crust. The dumplings were steamed to perfection with popping flavors of ginger. It was really yummy! The Wild Mushroom Pizza was also very tasty! We shared the appetizer and the pizza.

No one acknowledged the issue, they all played it down. The pizza was mediocre. I left feeling hungry after having four slices. The crust was unremarkable, better than stale crackers, I guess. The mozzarella had nice flavor, but the texture was too chewy. Total lack of sauce, prepare for cottonmouth if you choose to dine here. The toppings were scarce and an afterthought.

CPK @ Fashion Valley is located right by AMC and is a short walk from the top floor parking lot. They have 4 pick up parking spots reserved as well in the parking lot for guests picking up pizza! I've always had a great experience at this location. I have been here several times for lunch and several times on Friday after work for dinner. The wait is never more than 10 minutes and the servers are always responsive and take care of you very well. I usually have to ask for their complimentary bread, which is fine as i Imagine some people don't want to start their meal with bread and would rather wait for what they ordered. But the bread is delicious and super fresh, so I would recommend to ask for it :) I love their spicy chipotle chicken hand tossed pizza and i always add avacado to it. I also love the Tostada pizza which is a thin crust pizza - mexican style. It does not have traditional red sauce, but rather has a black bean base topped with lettuce, cheese, and chips. You can add chicken or another meat for an additional cost to this, but I usually stick to veggie.  The drinks are pretty great as well, good for the price and delicious.  A great tip for veggies/allergies: The CPK Website has an extremely detailed Allergen Menu which basically mentions EVERY single ingredient used in their dishes. So if you are strict vegetarian, or have any kind of allergies, you can easily lookup the dish you are interested in ordering - and it will tell you what it has. I know they have gluten free crust which attracts a lot of my co-workers, but I have never personally tried that one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=40,3.12,3.39,3.272,2.7039999999999997,3.282

Most of his table were white folks. At that point I felt discriminated only because I am Mexican, I don't deserve good customer service?

To start it was the night before my wife's birthday and we wanted to spoil ourselves and be a little lazy. We placed an order through grubhub at 745, received a 'driver is on their way' notification about 15 minutes later.

Now the wait was a bit however for free food there will always be a wait. However they were fast at cleaning tables and getting people seated. Now if you want a good hostess look at pic and get her she is grate love her. Let's get to the food. We got gluten free pizza now most are ok even BJs is not that good but I like to stay gluten free as much As I can. To my surprise when I took a bit of it it was really good. I guess that is what you expect form a high end place. They even had BJs beat by a miles on that one to my surprise. Agin the hostess came back to see how every thing was going serval times filled my water up because I don't drink soda bad for you at meal time by the way. Now this one of those places you think cost a bit of a pizza so you don't really look at it that hard because you spend good money and not that good it just like all the others you get mad at your self. Now when they offer free food you go and check it out. By the why they take care of us  vets love them for that. Now that is a place I did not go last year on Veterans Day I should kick my self because I though it was just like the rest and went to BJs well now I know better.

We had a minimal wait and the Host was friendly and welcoming. Once seated, it was only moments before the server arrived to take our drink order.  We let him know we were ready to order and he said that we'd made some good choices. The service was excellent, our server continually check on us throughout the meal without being overbearing or intrusive. The food was delicious, fresh ingredients and I highly recommend the Strawberry Salad with chicken and avocado; other protein choices included salmon and shrimp. Also, the Cucumber Non-Alcoholic Spritzer is a must try! It's amazing and a recommendation made by our server.

The old location was located on the second level of the mall right next to the food court, the old environment looked dull and old, all of the seats were close quarters of your neighbor and they had decorated CPK pizza boxes that were stacked up around the restaurant to me it looked tacky.  The new location is like a breath of fresh air, its spacious, its modern, the colors are vibrant, the staff is very friendly. The restaurant is a representation of San Diego with awesome photography on the walls. The hostess ""Lauren"" was very nice, she showed us to our seat (which was a nice boosted chair booth) Lauren told us that they just grand opened the new restaurant 2 weeks ago and that they've added new items to CPK menu and working on adding more items soon.  Our table waiter ""Alex"" was a cool guy, he brought us some yummy on the house French bread   and a olive oil dip that tasted bomb . Com. Alex took our drink orders Raspberry ice tea (not too sweet) Peach ice tea ( not too sweet )  Regular ice tea ( not to sweet ) My mother in law ordered the brand new West Coast burger  (WCB) and it came with a side of  potatoes   My wife ordered the wild mushroom  pizza   And I ordered the jambalaya fettuccine (spicy)  The food was scrumptious and filling.  -------------------------------------------// The new location is located right next to the malls information Booth on the first floor, if you go down the escalator and walk as if your going to the C parking garage.

We started lunch around 3pm. It's a popular location, in a big shopping mall so we had a brief wait for a table. No problem.  We were seated in a nice booth and ordered drinks.  I got up to use the woman's restroom; it was VILE. I walked out, notified the hostess and asked for an alternative bathroom.  The hostess used her pen and pointed it over the bridge of my nose to direct me out a patio door to a mall restroom nearby. I had to step back. I don't know why she thought that was appropriate... People have different bubble spaces so...idk what that was about? Whatever. Anyway, I walked out the door she pointed to with her pen, and found an outdoor patio with no exit. Great.  So, I walked back into the restaurant, climbed over some children and people who were crammed in the entrance waiting to check in for a table, squeezed out the door and waiting in line for almost 10 min to use the mall restroom.  When I returned, our drinks had still not been served.  I asked to speak to the manager who arrived promptly. I explained the restroom situation. He returned later and stated the hostesses had taken care of the problem and he apologized for the inconvenience.  After all of that, we finally placed an order. My order was from the gluten free menu.  Almost 30 minutes later, a food runner appears with two pizzas that look relatively the same. I asked, ""Is that gluten free?""  Food Runner; ""Um, it doesn't' look like it. I am not sure. I don't really know. Do you want me to check?""  Me; ""Yes, yes I definitely want you to check."" Waitress came back owned the mistake and apologized. Gluten free pizza being rushed.  I really appreciate when people own their mistakes.  Gluten free pizza FINALLY arrived. We had a couple of other misunderstandings with the staff; we asked for water refills and only one empty glass was filled. Had to ask as second and third time. Relatively minor snafus. The waitress was super nice and owned every mistake.  Finally finished, I put down my credit card to pay.  I went to the restroom to wash my hands. REALLY? YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME CPK!

The half sandwich is huge! I got the roasted turkey and brie sandwich with a caesar salad. They were both super delicious. I also tried the crispy mac & cheese plate and those were really tasty too.

The original location was really close to the food court, but now that they've moved to the first level, the improvements have been amazing. Prior to their move, the seats on their ""patio,"" were pretty basic and compact, the new patio is a lot more open with updated tables and seating. We saw the inside of the restaurant briefly but it looked so much more updated than the original! Great job on the renovations!  Saturday wasn't too busy at all, Bryan and I opted to sit outside because it was such a wonderful day, again I am thoroughly impressed by the seating on the patio. We started off with the corn salsa and chips, which we love and their complimentary bread and olive oil. Tasty, for sure I always love their corn salsa! They have a CPK rewards system, totally free to register and I think you still receive a coupon for a free starter.  Bryan orders a pizza and I order a the jambalaya pasta, this is my favorite thing to order here! I love the andouille sausage they add to the pasta along with the crawdads, if you want something spicy and filling this pasta is perfect for you.

The restaurant is a representation of San Diego with awesome photography on the walls. The hostess ""Lauren"" was very nice, she showed us to our seat (which was a nice boosted chair booth) Lauren told us that they just grand opened the new restaurant 2 weeks ago and that they've added new items to CPK menu and working on adding more items soon.  Our table waiter ""Alex"" was a cool guy, he brought us some yummy on the house French bread   and a olive oil dip that tasted bomb . Com. Alex took our drink orders Raspberry ice tea (not too sweet) Peach ice tea ( not too sweet )  Regular ice tea ( not to sweet ) My mother in law ordered the brand new West Coast burger  (WCB) and it came with a side of  potatoes   My wife ordered the wild mushroom  pizza   And I ordered the jambalaya fettuccine (spicy)  The food was scrumptious and filling.  -------------------------------------------// The new location is located right next to the malls information Booth on the first floor, if you go down the escalator and walk as if your going to the C parking garage.

This new location in the mall has moved to the lower level and it's around back near Boudin. It's really nice and modern looking with a cute outdoor patio too. Parking in the structures on that side is most convenient for accessing the restaurant. Not only was the event amazing because they served us a bunch of food, but we also got ""goodie bags"" that came in pizza boxes which included a cookbook, CPK sunglasses, a t-shirt, and a $25 gift card! So, of course a few of us who attended the event went back to use our gift cards a couple days ago. Since we went in the afternoon, they had a lunch portion of their menu. I decided to do the half sandwich + half salad combo for $10.95. You have the option to upgrade to a full sandwich for a few dollars extra and I considered it, but I was really happy I didn't. The half sandwich is huge! I got the roasted turkey and brie sandwich with a caesar salad. They were both super delicious. I also tried the crispy mac & cheese plate and those were really tasty too. Both times I've gone in the past few weeks the staff have been amazingly friendly and welcoming.

The original location was really close to the food court, but now that they've moved to the first level, the improvements have been amazing. Prior to their move, the seats on their ""patio,"" were pretty basic and compact, the new patio is a lot more open with updated tables and seating. We saw the inside of the restaurant briefly but it looked so much more updated than the original! Great job on the renovations!  Saturday wasn't too busy at all, Bryan and I opted to sit outside because it was such a wonderful day, again I am thoroughly impressed by the seating on the patio. We started off with the corn salsa and chips, which we love and their complimentary bread and olive oil. Tasty, for sure I always love their corn salsa! They have a CPK rewards system, totally free to register and I think you still receive a coupon for a free starter.  Bryan orders a pizza and I order a the jambalaya pasta, this is my favorite thing to order here! I love the andouille sausage they add to the pasta along with the crawdads, if you want something spicy and filling this pasta is perfect for you.

The Chipotle mac and cheese part was good too but they had green onions and cilantro in it which really threw off the flavor for me I could have done without those. My family got the lunch Duo which I think is fabulous. Miniature personal Pizzas and either a soup or salad the pepperoni as usual was fabulous and my mom decided to try their pepperoni sausage and mushroom which she said was out of the box for her but she really enjoyed it.

My girlfriend and I decided to eat here after some Christmas shopping, so it was a great place to sit down and enjoy some pizza. Food: I ordered the California Club pizza, and my girlfriend ordered the original bbq chicken pizza. The california club pizza has bacon, roasted chicken, mozzarella, topped with avocado, basil and arugula tossed in a really light lemon-pepper mayo. I thought at first that the lemon-pepper mayo would be overbearing, but it actually was really light and did not overpower the taste of the pizza. If this pizza had tomatoes, it would be THAT much better. The original bbq chicken pizza is tasty; there is a reason why it's the first pizza on the pizza menu. It's really basic, yet surprises me every time. The crust here is amazing as well. The dough is soft, and carries the pizza nicely. Oh yeah, forgot to mention the complementary bread and olive oil. That's really good too. :x Ambiance: CPK is clean, and comfortable inside and outside on their patio. We sat outside because it was a nice day. There are plenty of tables outside, and the noise level from the mall wasn't bad at all. I'd recommend it for any type of event such as birthday parties, since they do have tables that'll accompany large parties.   Service: The customer service was great at all aspects of the restaurant. We were seated right away, and our waiter quickly came and was polite and respectful in all of our interactions. Nothing to fret about here.

If this pizza had tomatoes, it would be THAT much better. The original bbq chicken pizza is tasty; there is a reason why it's the first pizza on the pizza menu. It's really basic, yet surprises me every time. The crust here is amazing as well. The dough is soft, and carries the pizza nicely. Oh yeah, forgot to mention the complementary bread and olive oil. That's really good too. :x Ambiance: CPK is clean, and comfortable inside and outside on their patio. We sat outside because it was a nice day. There are plenty of tables outside, and the noise level from the mall wasn't bad at all. I'd recommend it for any type of event such as birthday parties, since they do have tables that'll accompany large parties.   Service: The customer service was great at all aspects of the restaurant. We were seated right away, and our waiter quickly came and was polite and respectful in all of our interactions. Nothing to fret about here.  I have always enjoyed CPK, and this location is probably the best one I've been to. Order the pizzas, you won't be disappointed; it is what they're known for, right??",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego,3.48,3.56,3.364,,3.5280000000000005
1,Ashley D.,"San Diego, CA",6,22,7.0,2.0,2017-12-03,"Two stars is being generous. The only good thing about our experience is that we were able to call ahead so we didn't have to wait long for a table. Once seated it took a very long time for our server to visit. She immediately said, ""Sorry for the wait i just got here."" Seemed unprofessional and perhaps poor planning on the hostesses part. She wasn't familiar with a margarita we requested, confirmed It with the bartender, then the wrong drink was still delivered. It took awhile to get her back to place our food order and the food was not worth the wait. Don't bother with the artichoke dip, it's disgusting. A few minutes before our food arrived she offered us bread with oil which was fine until I realized the table next to us had balsamic and oil with their bread. It was just one disappointment after another. We won't be visiting a CPK again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-diego?start=20,3.36,3.53,3.364,,3.462

We also ordered two pastas the garlic cream fettuccine which was not creamy it was dry. The other pasta that we order was the kung Pao spaghetti which was the only thing I really enjoyed, but I felt like I got ripped off with the amount of chicken that I paid extra for. I also did not like the over priced Caesar salad that we ordered I would understand if there was a twist or something special, but there wasn't definetely not worth my 12 bucks. The bread that they started us out with could had been good if it came with butter, but it came with oil instead which made the bread too greasy.
