Had the roasted garlic chicken pizza and it was super good and garlicky on your first few bites and then it got pretty salty really quick. Maybe it was the cheese. Then the spaghetti bolognese(spelling?) was as good as any spaghetti with meat sauce and the garlic creme fettuccine was really good too. The only problem with the pastas was that there is just not enough sauce. The food is good but could be better especially at those prices. And not to mention you have to pay for adding anything i.e. $1.50 thin crust, $1 mushrooms, $4 chicken..??? comes out to $13-14 pastas and pizzas.

They certainly did not skimp on the goodies, there were lots of squash, chicken, avocado, beets and almonds sprinkled in the salad.

198,Jonathan D.,"San Francisco, CA",50,29,,3.0,2012-02-05,"We decided to try out CPK for a post Super Bowl dinner.The place was pretty empty and the service was fairly prompt. We had a nice server, who was more than happy to help, but got some of the order wrong.  We ordered;  App: Firecracker Shrimp: The portion was surprisingly small, and fairly bland. It tasted like the walnut prawns you can get at any chinese restaurant tossed in some Sriracha. It was small shrimp,in a pile on top of fried sai fun noodles. I could have made it at home, better, in 5 minutes. Entree: Meat Lovers Pizza: I hate canadian bacon - since it is not real bacon and has that smack of ham flavor I cant stand. I asked the server if I could substitute the canadian bacon for extra peperoni. He said that would be fine. I also asked to get the Multi-grain crust. I received the pizza pretty quickly. It was hot and fresh and really tasty. The only issue with the pizza was that it was on the honey wheat, not multi grain, crust with the canadian bacon invading the harmony of the other meats. At that point I didn't mind so I ate it anyway. Im sure there was a mix up in the kitchen and he picked up the wrong pizza. Lemon Chicken Piccata: It came pretty quickly. The chicken was cooked well and it was nicely presented. Upon first bite the lemon flavor was overwhelming, but then quickly mellowed into the other flavors of the sauce. Each bite was another lemon attack. It wasn't bad, per se.... it was just intense. The pasta portion of the dish was a little undercooked. It was still hard and gummy to the bite. Otherwise it was pretty good.  Desert: This is where the meal shined. Brownie Sunday & Soufflé Cake - similar flavor profiles but by far the soufflé cake outshone the brownie sunday. The Sunday is served in a ala mode with some whipped cream garnishes. Its pretty good. The soufflé cake is the Brownie Sunday on crack. Its lighter fluffier and its served in a pool of rich vanilla cream. Its soft, and velvety and extremely tasty.  The overall meal was good, It wasn't great. The portions were pretty small. The food came fast, and hot. The server was pretty nice and helpful as well. Over all the meal was ok. It wont be my go-to restaurant, but something to do on a whim if I'm in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-francisco-2?start=200,3.16,3.35,3.35,2.604,3.274

My water is always filled and I like how when the meals do go out they offer fresh ground pepper in front of you. Although, they always try to sell me on dessert, but I guess that's their job. HA maybe next time.  PRICE: The pricing is not too bad for this kind of restaurant. My total is about $24 for both the pasta and the drink. $8 for drink $16 for the food with San Francisco Tax. I expected to pay this amount.  FOOD/BEVERAGE: I love the linguini. Not to dry and full of flavor. The proportions are perfect that I do not need to take home any leftovers.

After we sat down, the waiter took our drink orders and food orders. Everything was ok.  Got our drinks. Then nothing.... Literally nothing... NO BREAD. NO FOOD. After waiting 45 minutes for our food to arrive, and complained to the waiter SEVERAL times to check on the food. The waiter said he would check on the food. STILL NOTHING. Then, I went up to the manager John Hodge. He replied with a very unsatisfying/douchebag answer and looks like he could care less. "" Do you guys still want it or not."" WOW. SHOCKED. WORST CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE EVER. Apparently, the waiter didn't put our orders in right away. Then had the kitchen rush it. INCOMPETENT IDIOTS.   Gave us free/gross looking slices of cake.

Sure enough we were sat immediately and our server made sure to visit our table within a few minutes. He made great recommendations and didn't mind that we were often caught up in conversation.  I wish I could say the meal was as pleasant as the staff. My co-worker did mention to me that one of the reasons she was reminded that she did not dine at CPK as much as she would like was due to the calorie counts that are all over the menu. She told me she felt embarrassed and it often discouraged her to order what she really wanted.  I ordered a raspberry-lemon drop martini (which was recommended by our server) and it was quite delicious! I then ordered the tequila-lime chicken fettuccine and received it at a luke warm temperature and was surprised to see small bits of what looked like chicken nuggets versus chicken breast. There was definitely a lack of quality with my pasta dish.

I think I had one of their frozen pizzas once from the store - but that doesn't count. Question: where has this pizza place been all my life?! I was thoroughly impressed with all our food. We sampled their new flat bread menu. My favorite was the one with fennel sausage. I was really blown away by the quality and size of their salads. Our table shared the Caramelized Peach salad and the Roasted Veggie salad. All the ingredients were fresh. The dressing was tasty without being overbearing.  Most surprising of all was the dessert! We shared the Salted Caramel Pudding (yum!) and the melt-in-your-mouth Butter Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream (food coma, be damned!). It's funny - I always had preconceived notions of CPK. For some reason, I had categorized it with other national chains like Olive Garden and Outback Steak House. But I couldn't have been more wrong. This place is seriously legit.

The manager packed up our lunches in to go boxes and brought them to us, and they were really cold, which meant our food had been sitting there for a while completely ignored by our server. The manager took the most expensive meal and a drink off the check, but then screwed up the charge to one of the credit cards so we had to wait longer to get that cleared up.

Dinner was very delicious! and we were having a good time even though, the server didn't give us bread. i know CPK offer bread but our sever said "" it's too late so we don't have any more bread."" i understood but the unpleasant moment is when we paid the check. our check amount was $72.23 something,my father gave $100 bill to our server, but the server gave us change $27 without NO CHANGE, so i asked him (the sever is a white guy with brown color beard and has very loud voice) ""where is my changes?"" and then he is acting weird, he just grope his body and his pants pockets and siad out loud "" NO Change!"". I felt very unpleasant. I didn't ask  the change from his pocket.I just asked him about my change from restaurant.  i meant, i felt bad about our server's acting. i understand if the restaurant has any change because we came late but he sould ask us before he gave us check or change. that is MANNER!

So for dinner we ordered: a thin crust meat craver's pizza, a veggie lover regular crust pizza, a thai chicken pizza, half of Caesar salad and half of a Cobb salad. I thought that the Caesar and Cobb salad would be a lot since it was pretty expensive - about 11 dollars for the Cobb and 8 dollars for the Caesar - however it was pretty small when I got it. Thin crust meat cravers pizza was good but the crust was a little soggy and not crispy like I wish it would be.  Thai chicken pizza wasn't how I remembered it - it wasn't as good unfortunately - a lot of carrots and sprouts but not a lot of chicken and the sauce was super salty.  Veggie lovers pizza - best pizza out of the group - nice and abundant variety of veggies! always good. :) Both salads were just overpriced for the portions.  The take out service was alright - I didn't know that they have to charge 10 cents for the bag that we needed to carry out the three pizzas and two salads....but at least it wasn't a plastic bag - it was a reusable bag and kind of a cool carrier too.

Now to the most unexpected part, I had a very nice young gentleman name Marcus (sorry if I spelled your name wrong ) sit next next to us who was dining alone. We made quick eye contact and I gave a kind smile. I'm never one to intrude even with a glance to the TV to check on the Giants game in his direction but you can tell he was enjoying his time there and the banter with Raquel. Anyways Marcus provided a nice early Father's Day present by paying for our meal!!! What a BEAUTIFUL THING! Much LOVE and good vibe you my man!

Having a conference for work back in early October led me to a location pretty much across the street from this place. I was with my co-workers on an hour and a half lunch break and one pitched the idea of pizza. I saw the California Pizza Kitchen and I was a bit skeptical at first. My skepticism was based around the fact that the town I live in (Stockton, CA) had a CPK near the Mall for only a brief time before it went under. I hadn't eaten at the location when it was in town but had automatically assumed that it wasn't any good. Also, when you look at a Brand that pushes out Frozen Pizzas (see -  ), you start thinking the real deal is going to be as weak as the Frozen Pizza. I should've known better.  We sit down with about a party of 10 total and we're immediately greeted and have our drink orders taken. It was pretty dead inside for a Monday afternoon around lunch time. I noticed a couple people walk in and one of the employees knew them (as if they were regulars there). With it being pretty quiet inside with only a handful of parties, I started gauging the employee culture. I heard the bartender cracking jokes with a server, and every employee had what looked like to be a genuine smile on their faces. There was a sincere personable vibe among the staff on how they were treating the customers. It came off as if every person walking in the door was a regular.  We waited a bit for the food to come out (necessary with a party of 8). The wait wasn't too bad. The food was cooked to perfection. It's like everything came off the oven at the same time. My pizza was hot, it had more of a soft texture to the dough instead of a crispy texture, but the pie still had the golden brown look to it. Our waiter was very attentive and offered us refills to go. Overall we had a fantastic time and the food was really good. The conference was a multi-day event and I ended up eating here again the following day. Wish there was one in my town that did as well. I know Pizza is a hard business to be in. Look at all of the chains out there, along with the non chain businesses, you can pretty much find pizza anywhere every couple of blocks in San Francisco. Next time I come to town and I'm in the area, I'll be stopping by. Expect me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-francisco-2?start=40,3.0,3.31,3.256,2.612,3.186

36,Jonathan R.,"Concord, CA",257,886,1047.0,3.0,2016-12-08,"Once again, my best friend and I were burdened with the task of finding dinner in San Francisco, a city that is a melting pot of unique cuisine. The first place we found had a 45-minute wait that we just could not do. The second place we looked at was over $30.00 a plate, which was out of our budget tonight. Right before settling on Denny's, Mel's, or god forbid, McDonald's, we came across CPK.  I love the California Pizza Kitchen, and she has never been, so this was the perfect place to be. The place was pretty empty, but there was also no host at the front. Instead, the bartender ALL the way in the back made his way to the front just to seat us. We were seated right next to the exit, which on a very cold and rainy night, was not ideal. Every time the door opened, we were hit with frigid air.  We were hungry so we knew we wanted an appetizer; however, we did not want to spend $12.00 on one, so we went with the hummus starter. The plate comes with six pieces of flat bread, and a small dish of hummus topped with slice tomatoes in the middle. Both the bread and hummus was good, and definitely worth the price.  We ordered the The Works with no black olives. The pizza came out, and it looked beautiful. Not Victoria's Secret beautiful, but more like Picasso beautiful; it's unperfect and unique. It's all about the flavors though, and the flavor train was definitely present. The best part of the pie for me was the sausage. The sausage alone carries so much of the flavor that I could just eat that alone.  We ordered dessert, and like the appetizers we went for the cheapest one possible. It was a salted caramel pudding, with homemade whipped cream, and a cookie crust on the bottom. The whole thing was served in a little jar. It was small, tasted delicious, and in another word: Perfect.  The friendliest waiter of the evening wasn't even our waiter. His name is Jon, and he started a conversation with us because of our Nightmare before Christmas attire. He was incredibly sweet, fun, and I'm kind of sad he wasn't our waiter. Our waiter was fine though, and the manager of the place had a bit of a weird vibe to him. He took our check with money and we thought he was going to close us out. Instead, he hands the check to our waiter, who was just about to take care of another table. So, there was not point to what he did.  On the check there is an extra fee about a SF health care tax, or something like that. It's not a huge amount, however, it wasn't very pleasant to see either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-francisco-2,2.48,3.04,3.164,2.7640000000000002,2.8160000000000003
13,Marcus H.,"Napa, CA",197,2,,1.0,2016-12-20,"Kudos go out to our local California Pizza Kitchen, or CPK if you prefer.  For those who don't know, CPK is a kitchen that serves pizza. That doesn't keep them though for trying new things. Case in point, they went out on a limb and tried their hand at pasta; specifically Mac & Cheese tonight.  Now, normally Mac & Cheese is a dish best made by a college student on a budget completely out of their mind on a cocktail of weed from last night and caffiene as part of studying for exams tomorrow.  Of course one can't hold CPK to those impossibly high standards, and they did a fine job. They only misunderstood that they needed to cook the mac and cheese, or that it's best served hot (or at least warm). They also tried cooking other pasta- a pesto penne. Sure they misunderstood the italian term al dente to mean ""hard, crunchy pasta served cold"", but cooking non-pizza is hard! Not to half-way do anything, they are also experimenting with serving liquor.  I appreciated our server's dedication to learning how to serve liquor and how to pour fluids from one container into a glass like a human would at the bar, with such dedication I couldn't crush his dreams of learning how to socialize at a bar like a real boy. I realized that my waving for attention was both selfish and in vain, so I escorted myself to the front desk to request my own bill to pay and leave. Seeing places like CPK try and live beyond their station is refreshing in our modern climate of settling for ""only doing the things you're skilled enough to do"", no longer will America be held back my the limitations of things like competence!

Our delivery order arrived around 12 noon via Caviar. *Charred Shishito Peppers: East Asian shishito peppers pan-sautéed with soy, garlic, and red chili, Calories 220, Contains soy ($7.49) *Spinach Artichoke Dip: Served hot with housemade blue and white corn tortilla chips, Calories 930, Contains eggs, milk, soy, and wheat, May contain crustacean shellfish, fish, peanuts, and tree nuts ($11.99) *California Club Pizza: Nueske's applewood smoked bacon, roasted chicken, and Mozzarella, hearth-baked then topped with wild arugula, fresh torn basil, and Romaine tossed in lemon-pepper mayo, Calories 1320, Contains eggs, milk, soy, and wheat, no avocado, Substitute with Wheat Whole Grain Crust: Calories 25 ($15.99) As much as I like knowing how many calories are in the dishes I eat, I kind of think ignorance is bliss. That way, I don't feel so much like a fat a$$! But getting past the calories listed, I actually enjoyed the wheat crust on the pizza. And the salad to put on top of it. My coworker didn't use all the greens since they provided them on the side. I ended up grabbing a bunch of her leftover greens to eat with my slice of pizza. I adore shishito peppers, so they were good. Nice char and seasoned well. I found the spinach artichoke dip a little bland. Wanted to add salt and pepper to give it more flavor. I haven't to a CPK in years. Probably the last time was in Emeryville about five years ago? It was nice revisiting as I used to go to CPK a lot back in college.

It wasn't very busy or crowded when we came. My family & I ordered 4 pizzas for everyone to share. We ordered the Sicilian, Margherita, Roasted artichoke/Spinach & California Club pizzas.  It didn't take too long for our order to come- we waited for probably about 20 or so minutes. However, to our disappointment, our pizzas came cold & not hot at all.  It was as if they had been ready for some time, but were not served to us right away, as food should be served at any restaurant. We immediately notified the waitress who brought them out & she looked at us with disbelief.  She said ""Hmm that's weird... it's probably because we're a little understaffed. Well I can have those reheated for you...""  Being understaffed shouldn't be an excuse as to why you're serving cold food to your customers.  The California Club pizza consisted of a salad on top of a pizza, which is understandable for why it is not served hot. The others, however, should've not been served cold. When they were brought back, the waitress seemed to have an attitude & said ""Make space for me.""  The pizzas were all pretty good, but it was very disappointing that they weren't served hot. Some of them were hard/over cooked after they reheated them...  It makes me wonder if we were even served freshly made-to-order pizza...

28,Diego A.,"Daly City, CA",89,95,35.0,3.0,2018-01-12,"I'd give this location an overall 3.5 based on delivery. They often times burn the pizza crust but I have to say, I'm still drawn back by the thin crust pepperoni. The flavor is quite good. While there are many other better places, pizza-wise, I do think this CPK is a little more than decent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-francisco-2,2.68,2.8,3.076,,2.7520000000000002
