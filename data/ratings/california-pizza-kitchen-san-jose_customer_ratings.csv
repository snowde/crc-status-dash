171,Anh T.,"San Francisco, CA",653,98,155.0,3.0,2012-01-25,"I came here a couple of days ago for my boyfriend's sis's birthday dinner. I've never eaten at cpk before but the birthday girl seemed to really like this place so I looked forward to the dining experience.  Crowded crowded crowded!! The place was crawling with kids! Don't get me wrong, I like kids; but I honestly felt like i was at a chucky cheeses. The line was extremely long; but luckily, we called in an hour ahead of time to put our names on the wait list. Our table was all set when we arrived! :)) - Crispy Mac 'N' Cheese wasn't alllll that. One thing i hate about mac n' cheese is when it gets cold and the cheese hardens up. That pretty such sums up this dish; but in patty form...and deep fried.  - Korean BBQ Steak Tacos were pretty good. The spicy sauce they have on top really brought the whole dish together. On the other hand, just eating the meat alone, it had a consistency of really low grade meat...no bueno :( - Caramelized Peach  Salad was yummm(: i love fruit in my salad and the peaches and cranberries were definitely a hit for me. I think they put a little too much Gorgonzola cheese but other than that, i was still a happy camper! - Norwegian Atlantic Salmon wasn't as great as i expected it to be. The pasta was really bland and i had to add tons of salt & pepper, even lemon juice. My salmon was overcooked and it had a hard layer all around the fish... like they pan fried it for so long the sides turned hard.  Its a sad thing when the salads are better than the entrees. But then again...I didn't try the pizza either..my boyfriend says ""you're so embarrassing. Going to a pizza place and eat everything but the pizza is like going to a steakhouse and not eat the steak"".  hahaha ooopsies! ill be sure to get the pizza if i ever come back!

229,John J.,"Capitola, CA",1,7,,4.0,2012-02-20,"We had a party of 3 for lunch on a Saturday. We found the whole staff welcoming. Our server, Christina, was great. She was attentive, without hovering, knowledgeable about the menu, and prompt with her service. We thought the menu offerings were fun, interesting, and extensive. The food was tasty. We had 2 different kinds of pizza, standard cheese, and a mushroom blend. Both were good, not too heavy, and satisfying. These are not to be mistaken for New York quality pizzas, but they were fine for California, and when you need something different than Mexican. We received our second salad the same time as the pizza, and Christina did not blink an eye when we asked to cancel the salad. She assured us it would not appear on our bill. Later the manager came to check on us and to apologize for the late arriving salad. He also assured us that the salad would not be on our bill. Overall, a pleasant dining experience, and we will be back.

67,Jess D.,"Los Angeles, CA",1080,56,16.0,2.0,2012-06-15,"You know you have a YELP problem when you are dining at a restaurant and the second they mess up your order, you shout ""People are gonna hear about this on YELP! ya hear me!?""  Okay... so maybe I didn't say that loud enough for the waiter and his crappy manager to hear me, but I said it to myself in character, as I sipped from my watered down tea with melted ice.  I am getting ahead of myself here. The day started with meeting a friend for lunch at California Pizza Kitchen, or as us lazy social networking abbreviators like to say, ""CPK"". That sounds so LA... ugh!  Anyways, I ordered a half thai chicken salad, with no scallions.  Now maybe this might defeat the purpose for some people, when it comes to their Thai salads, but I am a no onion, no scallion kinda gal... so when I say no scallion, no scallion... capiche?  What does the waiter bring me? a salad with scallions all up in it. I felt as violated as a Kardashian sex tape, as I bit into the salad - and from my lip, fell an oniony flavored morsel... YES, a SCALLION!  At that point, I felt just like Faye Dunaway portraying Joan Crawford in MOMMIE DEAREST.. ""NO SCALLIONS! I SAID...NO SCALLIONS!"" (yes I reference this movie in yelp reviews a lot, just bare with me).  Just as this visual played perfect in my mind of yelling this to our waiter, he was nowhere to be found. Gone Baby Gone, Without A Trace, Bye Bye Birdie, like every bad titled tv show or movie that I had ever seen, he was MIA (and bad singers too).  A good 6-8 minutes (which felt like 30) passes by and along comes the manager to ask how everything is and fill up our drinks.  I tell her about my salad, (which by this point, I have just started eating and taking out the scallions). She then asks if I want to replace it, and I tell her, it is ok, I will just pick the rest out, being I had picked a bunch out already...plus, we had to catch a movie and time was ticking.  So, when my bill comes, she doesnt give me the salad for free, like most chain type restaurants would, she deducts just $3.00 from the salad (a $9.50 salad).  Mind you, I also purchased food for my children. It is not like the bill would have been a zero balance, if she took the salad off.  I still was going to pay for other items. I just found it kind of a bummer that instead of just crediting the half salad for their mistake, she basically wiped a measly 10% from my $30.00 meal.  At that point.. I just wanted to get up and say ""YOU CANT HANDLE THE TRUTH!"" or go into some sort of ROCK OF AGES / TWISTED SISTER ""We're Not Gonna Take It"" dance routine with my fellow dining patrons behind me all the way out the door.  One can dream, but my salad, on the other hand... like the wise guys from Good Fellas, can ""sleep with the fishes""...  Too soon?

The food is always great and comes out quickly, which can be a lifesaver when you have 2 hungry little kids.  The staff is PHENOMENAL. The hosts always greet you with a smile and seat you faster than what they quote you (if there's a wait). There are two managers, Andy and Kimmie, that always check on the guests to ensure things are going well. They are very friendly and you can tell that they enjoy their jobs! Since we do go there a lot, we usually ask for Cole or Ginger. Both are attentive and always on the ball. Our drinks get refilled before we finish them, even when it's a packed house.

I don't recommend one of those pizza/salad hybrids either; the presentation just looks awkward and I think pizza and salad belong on two separate plates. Since you came all the way to CPK, you should a pizza. They're sliced into quarters, and some of them come in the honey wheat crust variety. I had the Spicy Chicken Chipotle last time, but only because I wanted to try something new. Normally, I would recommend the Pear Gorgonzola or Thai Chicken or Jamaican Jerk. They are CPK's staples. Everything else that I've tried are a step below it. If you get dessert, get the Red Velvet Cake with vanilla ice cream, and make sure you  share with a friend. One slice is too big for just yourself, so for $8.25, you want to spread the happiness with your fellow man. In terms of just its pizza, this CPK is good. Of course there's better, Papa Murphy's Take and Bake for one, but for a sit-down pizza dinner with friends, CPK will do. Just be careful because it's pricey.

We came here about mid afternoon so no lunch rush to deal with and was seated right away. Since we were quite hungry, my bf and I ordered a spinach artichoke dip, thin crust California Club, and the chicken tequila fettuccine.  Our appetizer came out first (of course) and it was yummy. The dip wasn't thick like some places and it had a good consistency. My only negative feedback about this is the piece of artichoke heart in the dip, and the messy playing (dip spilled over the bowl). Those should be cleaned up before serving.  Our server also brought us some bread with (I'm guessing) rosemary olive oil. Let me tell you, the dip tastes really yummy with the bread! Next came our pizza and Alfredo. The pizza looked humongous because of the salad on top. It looked like a healthy pizza. I love the nuttiness of the arugula paired with some iceberg salad tossed in ranch. The bacon was cooked to perfection. It had a nice crunch with out the greasy fat or burnt taste. And the chicken melted into the pizza dough with the cheese. It was a nice combo, but a bit messy to eat.  When I first saw the Alfredo, I noticed the green pasta and thought it was a tad strange. As we tasted it, it had a perfect balance of flavor with a good hint of lime. It also had some sautéed onion and bell pepper which balanced the dish extremely we'll. Normally, we aren't fond of bell peppers because of how thick the cuts are (the flavors are very predominant). However in this dish, the peppers were julienned and brought great flavors without overpowering the dish.  Overall, everything was really yummy and we would definitely come back.  PS the mango iced tea and white Caribbean sunset sangria are delish! I'd recommend the mango iced tea!

Parking was a bit of the challenge, as it is most of the time if you're going to Oakridge mall. I drove around for about 10 minutes during lunchtime before I eventually found a spot. When I arrived, the waitress brought out mini slices of bread and oil for dipping. The bread was fresh and warm, I practically devoured the whole plate as I waited for my collegue to arrive. We started off with the ceasar salad, which was standard but good. I decided to order a pizza, given that it's their specialty. I opted for one of their original hand tossed pizza - the Wild Mushroom because I love mushrooms and it was highly recommended on Yelp. It comes with four types shaved cremeni, shiitake, white, Portobello mushrooms with mozzarella and pecorino romano cheeses. I love meat on my pizza, so I was happy to hear that I could add chicken to my pizza. The pizza was delish and the chicken was moist and soft, not overcooked or dry. The portion was big and I had a couple of slices to bring home for left overs.

272,Marc R.,"San Jose, CA",862,174,621.0,3.0,2014-06-25,"Well, of course I can only rate a chain restaurant like CPK a 3-star, especially since I've had some really good pizza in my life like Chicago deep dish pizza, and a few great NY pizza slices. As everyone else does when they go to CPK, we always order the Original BBQ Chicken Pizza (rate a 3/5) for $13.59. I remember it being a lot better when I was younger. Not sure if it just had something to do with this particular location that we visited about a week and a half ago for my little brother's college graduation celebration. Anyway, it's the standard order when we go to a CPK, which by the way, we haven't visited one in like... over 2.5 years. Anyway, the other pizza that I really like is a lesser known one, the Jamaican Jerk Chicken Pizza, which is listed on the thin-crust pizza section, but you can get it hand-tossed, which is what we did. I'd rate this pizza a 3.5/5, and it costs the same as the BBQ Chicken Pizza ($13.59). The Jamaican Jerk has a little bit of a kick to it, which we like. With all of the pizzas, we like to order a side of ranch to dip our crust, because the crust by itself doesn't taste like anything. We went with a group of 11 people, and each of us pretty much ordered an individual pizza, so we definitely ran the bill up. I personally think that the pizzas are a little pricey at almost $14 a pizza for 6 pretty small slices. But I guess that's just inflation.  In terms of service, our server wasn't the best. She didn't really know much about the pizzas and she definitely wasn't in the best of moods, and it didn't seem to put in an extra effort handling a larger group. Oh well, I guess.  We probably won't be going back to a CPK for a while, but I always enjoy those 2 pizzas, even though they are a little expensive in my books. Service could certainly use an upgrade, but all in all, CPK is always a fun, casual location to hang out with family and friends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose?start=40,3.68,3.38,3.38,3.308,3.5000000000000004

I ordered the Hawaiian (my favorite and a simple one to make so it should be good). What I got was extremely disappointing. Barely enough ingredients to cover the bland sauce underneath. The ham was sliced so thin there were holes in it. There were probably a total of 8 small pieces of pineapple (1 per slice). I think there might have been some cheese, but didn't have my microscope with me to verify. The sauce had absolutely no flavor. To top it off, it arrived cold. It seemed as though it had been sitting on a table in the back area, placed on a cold plate and served. I started eating it because I was with friends and didn't look at it closely when it arrived.

The waiter said he would bring his manger, which she told 20 mins to come to the table. when she arrived her attitude was OUT OF THIS WORLD, she was sarcastic and practically yelling. She stated that the bread is a free/complementary item so I basically should not be suprised by the fact that they are out. When I asked if there was anything (chips/crackers) they could bring for the kids to snack on until the food was ready, as we had been waiting quite some time and the kids were very hungry. She said I was welcome to order an appetizer, which would then need to be made in the kitchen. I went on Yelp to look if this location has these types of reviews. The manager looked over at my phone screen and then stated ""Don't threaten to write a review on Yelp"". This highly upset our grandmother who said that we did not say anything, but we do have the right to write a review on yelp. We asked that the manager not return to our table because her attitude and tone of voice was aggressive at the point. She returned to our table twice after that. Firstly time to show me the time that our order was entered in there system, then she came to deliver our food. I guess it was the mangers way of making herself feel in charge.

Nothing against the food itself but maybe the communication between kitchen and other staff. Our waiter was distracted and inconsistent. We had to try and flag him down since he wasn't very good with checking in with us and had to wait forever even to get a water refill. When my mom was ordering her food she asked for a salad with grilled shrimp. He even said ""okay a salad with chicken"" no sir... I said shrimp. And he repeated it back the second time, ""Okay great, a salad with shrimp."" So you would expect it to be right once it came to the table. Nope, instead it still had chicken. So we had him take it back and get shrimp which took a while because it had to be grilled. Second time around and now there was no dressing on the lettuce. Instead of apologizing and saying he would fix it, he just laughed and said huh, weird... And then walked away.

179,Stacy M.,"San Jose, CA",0,4,,2.0,2015-08-10,"Came in to Cpk Friday night after about 6 months of not dinning here. My family and I were avid fans of this location for many years but after our last experience I will not be going back. First and for most the whole staff has done a complete 360. The food had always been mediocre but the staff had always been the reason why we returned time and time again. We came mostly for Joyce and Ginger. Both amazing bartenders with the sweetest dispositions. I can't even begin to explain the service we encountered this last weekend. I will not mention a name because I'm not in the business of getting anyone in trouble, but for one we sat for nearly 10 minutes without even so much as a acknowledgment. Once we were greeted our drinks took another 10 minutes. Not to mention our waiter knew nothing about the menu and it showed. Our appetizers came out the same time as our food and all he could say was it happens like that quite often. WTH. On top of that my family and I listened to a whole conversation  our server was having with another co worker that was not only inappropriate but rather offensive. We then proceeded to ask about our two favorite girls and our waiter told us that one had moved to LA and the other was fired and proceeded to tell us the story as if it was breaking news. I'm sorry but a simple they don't work here anymore would have sufficed yet they continued on with this defamation of character that made me feel almost uncomfortable. Little did they know my family and I still are loyal regulars of hers. Between the tardiness of our food and the lack professionalism we asked to speak to a manager. But it seemed as if we were being rushed out of the door by our server and we're told the manager was very busy and then another server came over to ask if there was anything they could do for us. We're we supposed to believe that this young child like girl was the manager. We payed our bill and left never to return. If your really craving CPK I recommend the Valley Fair store. My 2 stars are only for the few crew members that still remain that remind us of why we came back  in the first place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose?start=120,3.64,3.55,3.55,3.0800000000000005,3.5860000000000003

The ingredients were actually really fresh for the most part, but it was lacking flavor and it didn't have as much of a crunch to it as I would have liked.  As for the service that too was okay, it was a bit crowded when we went so our food did take a little while to get to us, but our waitress Rebecca was a really sweet so we didn't care too much.

260,Sonia G.,"San Jose, CA",255,296,480.0,3.0,2016-01-18,"Came here during lunch rush hour on MLK day. Mall was insane. California Pizza Kitchen was packed but they sat us within 10 minutes. We sat down and were ignored for about 10 minutes. We finally flagged down a waitress to ask if they can take our drink order. We asked for water and she said she would bring it right out. All of the waitresses looked stressed out. Two managers were walking around helping pass out food to customers. One of the managers noticed us and asked if he can take our drink order and said our waitress would be right with us. We were a bit confused since we already ordered our waters. Anyways, we said we were ready to place our orders. He was very pleasant, and took down our orders. The waitress came back with our waters and said, sorry, I know our manager already took your order. Sorry about the other waitress but I guess I will be your waitress now. Your food will be right out, is there anything else I can get you? We told her no, we were fine. As a customer, I have no idea what is happening behind the scenes. Although its apparent, everyone looks stressed out, we have not officially met our waitress who is suppose to be assigned to us- and how were we suppose to know? I thought all of that was unnecessary. Just give us our drinks, and our food. The waitress was very pleasant, and nice the whole time. Service was ok- we did not need a lot of the explanation of  another waitress who was suppose to be serving us or the behind the scenes miscommunication, blah, blah, blah. I don't know about the customer service today, it was kind of all over the place, but they got it together as the restaurant slowed down.  Food was alright. I ordered the tortilla soup and the italian sandwich. I guess it is my fault for not ordering the restaurants specialty- pizza. My friend enjoyed her chicken caesar salad. The Italian sandwich was gross. The sandwich was flimsy and I wish I had ordered something else. I probably should have returned it, and ordered something different, but I ended up picking at the sandwich and only eating half (not including the bread).  Maybe my taste buds are changing as I get older, but I am just not too crazy about CPK anymore.

My family and I were looking for a place to eat while shopping around Oakridge Mall and we decided to eat at CPK. It was a Saturday night and the wait was about 30 minutes which isn't as bad compared to the wait at Cheesecake Factory. Although, they seemed disorganized. One of the waiters said we were ready to be seated, took us to our table and then told us she made a mistake and that our table wouldn't be ready in about 10 more minutes. When it was really our turn to be seated, we were given menus without the drink menu. Our waiter came and introduced himself, noticed that we didn't have drink menus and kindly got us it. After a few minutes, we ordered and waited for our food for about 15 minutes. During our wait, we had some on-the-house fresh bread to dip with herb olive oil. The waiter was kind enough to get us more after we were done! For our order, we ended up getting the Thai crunch salad, Sicilian pizza, BBQ pizza, wild mushroom pizza and the chicken tequila fettuccine.  The Thai Crunch salad was really good. Not the best salad I've ever had but it had the crunch of the ingredients, topped with thai peanut dressing that was delicious overall.  Out of the 3 pizzas I ordered, mine and my family's favorite was the BBQ chicken pizza with its sweet & tanginess. The Sicilian pizza and the wild mushroom were both tied for my 2nd favorite in different ways. The Sicilian pizza was basically a meat pizza with italian sausage, spicy capicola ham & salami. It was delicious but was a little bit too oily. Also, for a thin crusted pizza, it wasn't as crunchy as I would have liked it. The Wild Mushroom pizza is a definite pizza for mushroom lovers/vegetarians. I thought it was really good but my parents didn't like it so much so I guess it depends on the person. It was also a bit on the oily side as well. Overall, all the pizzas were pretty good but I wish they were baked a little longer because most of them came out soggy.  My favorite dish here was the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine. I finished this dish up fast. The jalapeno lime sauce was a perfect sauce to go along with it. It added a tangy taste to the spinach fettuccine. I definitely would recommend trying this dish here!  Overall, my experience was average.

I'd have to say yes! Are the other dishes up to par? I'd have to say unfortunately not. Don't get me wrong, I don't think they are capable of serving you a bad dish, but there are a couple of dishes that are just missing that ""WOW"" factor. Here is today's line-up: The Works (Pizza) Roasted Artichoke Spinach (Pizza) Sesame Ginger Chicken Dumplings Four Cheese Raviolis The pizzas were on point! No doubt! From the crust, meat, and artichoke hearts & spinach, everything was assembled and baked to perfection! Now moving on to the to the other dishes... The dumplings were decent, but the sauce that was drizzled on was a bit salty, and there was a little too much of it. I know the sauce also add's to it's presentation, but unfortunately it's consistency. The raviolis were cooked perfectly, but the cheese within was more bland than tasty. I was hoping it was just the first one I tried, but after eating my 3rd rav, it just didn't pack enough flavor for me. Our waiter was very friendly attentive, but he seemed a bit flustered at times. With a party of 14 it is understandable, but we found ourselves asking for things repeatedly. Luckily everything came out in a timely manner, so our overall experience here was a good one.

I wasn't feeling like having pizza on any of the times here. The first time I ate here with my son I chose the Jambalaya Fettuccine. It is one of their pasta items. It is described as blackened chicken and shrimp, crawfish, andouille sausage and tasso ham in our spicy cajun sauce. I really liked the flavors. Normally I don't eat spicy but their sauce I could handle. All the many shrimp were big and the crawfish were thankfully de-shelled. So those crawfish aren't too noticeable. Sausages were more visible. Fettuccine noodles were al dente. Good and consistent both times. They give a separate kids menu along with crayons. My son chose Hawaiian pizza and Fresh fruit. Second time around he chose the BBQ Chicken Pizza and also Fresh fruit. Fresh fruit are sliced pineapple and halved red grapes.  Size of our non-fat yogurt smoothies were huge. Definitely a large cup. We chose Mango & Strawberry Banana. Both were good too and made us full.

We weren't very hungry so my wife and I ordered the Asparagus & Arugula Salad, Buffalo Cauliflower, and the Wild Mushroom Strozzapreti to share.   First of all, the complimentary bread and olive oil dip was excellent.  The bread was warm and had a great texture.  The dip was a bit heavy on the rosemary but good nonetheless.  The salad was on the small side but tasty and had some good fresh ingredients. The cauliflower with the buffalo sauce was good but at $8, could have used a few more pieces. The best item was the pasta. The rolled pasta had great chewy texture, plenty of wild mushroom, and tossed in sauce with perfect amount of seasoning.  The Arnold Palmer had the right balance between lemonade and iced tea also.  Our server, David, was fantastic. He had several tables to take care of, including a large party, but seemed to be everywhere at once. We were also impressed with the fact that he split up the pasta dish for us without even being asked.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose,3.72,3.72,3.72,3.572,3.7200000000000006

My best recommendation is to park elsewhere and just walk there. Target has a parking structure and it's kind of nearest to most of the restaurants.  Anyway, we went at lunch time, 1230-ish and it was not busy at all. We got seated right away and our waiter was Noel, Noe, couldn't really see his name tag, something like that. Regardless, he was really attentive, greeted us with smile, told us about some of their drinks that they, and lastly, he came by checking up on us often and refilled our drinks without being asked. My sister-in-law ordered the Spaghetti bologanese (?) something like that, basically spaghetti with meat sauce (not pictured) but she normally likes it as she always orders that. I didn't try it. I had the Garlic Roasted Chicken Fettuccine and it was delish! It was just the right about of sauce, not too garlicky, and not too overwhelming. Really creamy and absolutely delicious. The bits and pieces of chicken was a little underwhelming, I felt that some pieces were dry and just didn't taste good. For an extra $3. I was better off without the chicken. The pizza was good. I don't like pineapple, so I didn't have any of the Hawaiian pizza, the mushroom, sausage, pepperoni pizza was good, although, the meats made the pizza a little salty.

Tiny mushrooms to add is $1.50, like really?!  -avocado eggrolls: so good! It comes with two types of dip, ranch and a chiptole creamy one. Its stuffed with avocado so if youre a fan this is a good choice for starters.  -the Works: stuffed by this pizza! Its hearty with pepperoni, sausage, olives, etc.  -blanco flatbread: big pass for me. It was basically cheese pizza that was SOOOOO oily.

I like how this restaurant has kept it's warmth.  The menus and uniforms changed but they still put the customer first.  We always have a great time and the food is always perfect. They do have a full bar which is a bonus since hubby likes scotch whiskey...ok, they don't have any scotch whiskey but they do have Jack Daniels. And that makes most everyone happy. I like the wine selection.  Not so big that you're scratching your head. But there are a few choices in good range of varietals.  I also like that they offer wine pairings with some of the menu items.  They also have 6oz and 9oz glass sizes.  (so I can get a 6oz wine for my appetizer and a 9oz with my meal). Do try the flatbreads. They're absolutely wonderful.  And I also love their tortilla spring rolls. I used to get that for my appetizer.  I appreciate they have seasonal dishes.  I wish they'd bring back the deep fried artichoke hearts. The bathroom is cleaned regularly. And it used to have a really awful smell. They've masked it. I suspect they've tried everything to get rid of it but can't. They have a counter area where you can just walk in and hop up and it's full service. This is nice if you're needing to get in and out quickly for a movie.  I love sitting there and watching the flames in the oven. It's like sitting in front of a warm fireplace. And I love the pizzas.  I wish they'd bring back the BLT pizza.   Anyway, I like the honey wheat crust.  And don't be afraid to branch out. You'd be surprised how great the pear and gorgonzola pizza is for lunch with a friend. I used to get half sized salads which were perfect.  (I like to rotate my preferences). And save room for the butter cake dessert.  We get ours without the ice cream.  Sure, we're heathens, but we don't want anything to get in the way of the toe curling numminess of the butter cake. So, I see people talk about parking.  Yes, it can suck. I park either over in the lot outside of Sears along Thornwood.  Or I'll park in the structure that's next to Sears.  There's almost always parking in the upper levels.  And then I walk to the food court area, exit the doors, turn left and walk a little ways.  It's not bad and it increases my fitbit numbers. Do I wish they had a mall entrance? Oh sure.  But they don't. So I plan on walking rather then parking near it.  There is a Valet Parking station right near them...you go past and then you can see the tent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose,3.56,3.69,3.69,3.7960000000000003,3.6380000000000003

For starters, they will serve warm bread with all of oil and herbs. This is fine but having a little balsamic vinegar with the Olive oil would go a long way. Can't complain though because it's complementary.  Pepperoni pizza- kids meal for my daughter. It's good, but so common. 3 stars.  Rib eye with finger potatoes and arugula salad- 4 stars. 12 oz ribeye. My favorite cut served with blue cheese butter. The blue cheese butter did not do much for the meat except made it slightly salty. Good  smoked grilled flavor. Slightly burned because the hubby likes it well done. The finger potatoes weren't all that- need some flavor And to be cooked further. Arugula did complement the rib eye.  I got the wild mushroom pasta. Their seasonal special menu. 3 stars mainly for flavor. The pasta was supposed to be sautéed with different wild mushroom but all I saw in the pasta was crimini mushroom. So disappointed. Supposed to have crimini, portabello, and ""seasonal mushroom"". I didn't make a big fuss because I was hungry but definitely did not come as advertise.

However, if you do decide to get it, let me know if the strawberry one tastes like lavender soap because it sure did to me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose,4.04,3.75,3.552,,3.866
5,Brenda L.,"Syracuse, NY",970,1933,3490.0,4.0,2017-12-14,"I love this place and come here on occasion with my family. It's a great restaurant to eat after a long day of shopping. I like their individual sized pizzas and salads. They even have pizzas that have tons of vegetables on top (basically a raw salad on top). I remember the excitement around this place when they first opened up. They sell alcoholic drinks, salads, sandwiches, pasta and desserts as well. The interior is casual/sophisticated but there is dining/sit-down service. It is good for a family meal or casual date. This place is called California Pizza Kitchen but their locations aren't exclusive to CA. This was the 1st place I ever saw an Asian-flavored pizza. They have frozen pizzas now at grocery stores so I try to order stuff that I don't see in their frozen food line in order to get a different experience. I always feel ripped off if I am buying something in a restaurant for more than what I can get it for at the grocery store.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose,4.0,3.76,3.552,,3.856

At $10 kid you get to make your own pizza, drink, a chef hat to decorate, an ice cream sundae and a tour of the kitchen.  The birthday child also gets a nice chef coat. The price is unbeatable and the service was great. The manager James is awesome. He was very helpful and accommodating. It felt very organized.  We got our own server that tended to all our needs.  She was great with the kids and was very attentive. Thanks Julie!  You have to have the party before the restaurant opens but you get the whole place to yourself with all the staff helping the only customers there (the party). I highly recommend having kid birthday parties here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose,4.04,3.77,3.564,,3.878

4,Alana Z.,"Campbell, CA",161,4,,2.0,2018-01-06,"Usually I go to the CPK at Valley Fair off Stevens Creek...but this by far has been a terrible restaurant experience. First, we waited 15 minutes to get our drinks and bread. Then, when we finally got our food my boyfriends steak was overcooked and dry so we had to take it back. And then our sodas were drowned down with water they poured- forgetting we ordered soda. I almost forgot to mention we waited 5 minutes after getting our food to get utensils. They gave us a $10 discount...but probably not coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-jose,4.04,3.75,3.564,,3.866
