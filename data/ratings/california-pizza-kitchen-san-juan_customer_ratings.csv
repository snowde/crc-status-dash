1,Emma D.,"Maynila, Philippines",118,279,316,3.0,2015-04-18,"Five words: Original Chicken BBQ Chopped Salad.  One of my favourite salads ever. There's just something about it that makes it taste so good. The combination of the ingredients makes it taste so fresh every time that you won't get tired of eating it and the next thing you know you're done with the whole order. I love love love it! Hey, their other stuff are good too don't get me wrong but that's just what I always get when I'm there. I love this branch because of its location, it's in a part of Greenhills where it isn't crowded all the time and the branch itself has a big area where you all can sit comfortably without having to brush elbows with your next door neighbour.  If you haven't tried CPK delivery then you're in for a treat! Everything is packed so nicely and whatever you might need would be there in the bag. Instructions are followed down to the last period. At least in my experience. So good job CPK!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-juan,,,,,
3,Lesley C.,"Maynila, Philippines",7,270,270,4.0,2015-05-16,"CPK changed its menu again. I was really sad a few years back when they took out the Jamaican Jerk Chicken Pizza. That was absolutely the best pizza they had.  In place of this, they have a lot of new stuff which is also quite palatable. They've since expanded their thin crust selections and as a vegetable lover, I thoroughly appreciated the California Veggie pizza - it has goat cheese, pine nuts, sundried tomatoes and broccoli.  Other good stuff on the menu: Sicilian thin crust, Five Cheese and Tomato, Original BBQ Chicken (can't go wrong with the classic), Mozzarella sticks, Philly Cheesesteak (YES, it's surprisingly awesome) and Moroccan Chicken salad. My sister really likes the Thai Crunch. It's a good choice if your palate is more Asian. For dessert, try the warm butter cake. It is like mamon with ice cream. So so good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-juan,,,,,
0,Mika F.,"Maynila, Philippines",50,129,173,4.0,2015-05-20,"With a name like California Pizza Kitchen, you might be expecting American-style pizza and food. Uh, not entirely. They actually serve a fusion of Asian food with Western influences. (Duh, pizza.) Their menu went through a few changes over the years, but I'm glad the quality of the food has remained the same.  CPK still serves my favorite Thai salad (Thai Crunch on their menu) and their pizzas are delicious! Try out their BBQ chicken pizza for something a little different. We're all so used to having tomato sauce on our pizza, but this one uses BBQ sauce. It might sound a bit weird, but it works, believe me! Sadly though, one of my favorite items on the menu - their Potato Leek Soup - is no longer available. :( Noooo!  If you haven't had your pizza fill with your main course yet, why not a pizza for dessert too? They've got Smores Pizza (topped with ice cream) to cap off your meal, as well as other desserts to choose from. They've got branches all around the metro, so you won't need to travel far to have some CPK! And inform me if at least one branch still serves that Potato Leek Soup, pleeeeease. :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-juan,,,,,
