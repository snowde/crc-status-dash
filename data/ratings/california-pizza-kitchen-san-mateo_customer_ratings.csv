So finally, I feel compelled to write a review. * Here's an idea: Hand out alerting monitors during long wait times so guests can browse nearby shops, instead of sitting around & hovering within earshot inside the echoing mall atrium. This isn't rocket science, this isn't even a new technology, and it's been used in restaurants for at least a decade by now. * Here's a simpler idea: Have staff neatly cross-out who's been seated and where they've been seated. Why? Because the CPK staff have said to me: ""Oh! Some one took your table."" which is ridiculous, b/c 1) the statement addresses the issue of who I should blame, instead of how the CPK staff plan to fix the mistake. * Here's the simplest idea of all: Have the SAME staff person manning & calling out the waitlist names, in order to minimize confusion.

Definitely recommend the habinero carnitas pizza - think carnitas, cilantro pesto, cheese and the SPICIEST SALSA EVER. It packs and punch!

A lot of families, a lot of people, a lot of noise. We kind of had to shout out our order to our waiter. He brought us our drinks, apologized because he had ice in my Mom's drink (we had ordered it without) so he took it back and got her a drink without ice. Our hummus arrived, tasty, the wheat pitas were hot to slather on the hummus.     Then our mains arrived. My hubs had the half Caesar salad with chicken and I had the roasted veggie salad half. Both are enormous, enough to feed two people rather easily. Our son had the mac and cheese which he loves. After a couple of minutes the California club pizza arrived ... except my Mom had ordered the California veggie pizza (which used to be the eggplant pizza). The waiter apologized profusely and took it back. He told us it would take about ten minutes to make the new pizza. After about a minute, another wait staff came by and asked if we wanted the pizza on honey whole wheat which we said yes.     My Mom and I ate my roasted veggie salad (which was super tasty) and about five minutes into our wait, the manager walked over to apologize profusely about the mix up. We told him it wasn't a problem and that we were fine. A couple of minutes later, the waiter returned to apologize again and tell us the pizza would be done within a few minutes. Sure enough, about five minutes later the pizza arrived.     The manager returned again to let us know that our pizza would be comp'ed for the mix up and made sure our bill reflected it. He apologized again to us and yet again as we left.     I have to admit, this was really refreshing.

Forget for a moment that you are at the edge of a busy shopping mall, children with limited manners, parents constantly checking their iDevices and the busyness with which the staff runs around delivering drinks and food around the place. sitting at the horseshoe bar focuses your attention on the oven and guys making the pizza - a great source of inspiration if you aren't sure what to order. Or... you could go on a random weeknight when it is much more quiet, sedate and decibels of an enjoyable level. Sit at the horseshoe bar and focus on the nice brick oven. This was a weeknight date spot for me and the girl for quite a while. 2 glasses of wine and soup or salad to start, then we could relax and decide what to get on on the main course, pizza. No hurry, no whining kids, no rushing servers waiting on multiple tables with multiple requests. Just calm, yummy scents and the heat from the brick oven. The BBQ chicken is the old standby, but they have lots of other standards (pepperoni and cheese) and more exotic mix and  match pizzas with seasonal greens, veggies and so on. If you do go on the weekend, specifically let the host(ess) know that you prefer bar seating - no kids allowed at the bar and you get in and seated quicker.

It's very unique and I've never had a fettuccine that was bursting with so much flavor. It doesn't taste like tequila per se, but there is a nice hint of lime and peppers within the sauce, and it has the perfect amount of creaminess. It comes with ample chicken and bell peppers and usually I can't even finish all of the meat. The noodles are always just the right texture and are never overcooked or under cooked. This is definitely a major plus for me, because a lot of restaurants, especially chain restaurants, do not cook the noodles for just the right amount of time. - Avocado egg rolls: These are crispy, sweet and salty, and who knew avocados would go so well within an egg roll. This is an appetizer that I usually never pass up whenever I come to CPK.  Service: I've never had an issue with the service or the wait. Most I've waited is about 15 minutes, and I've had attentive service each time.

48,Amy G.,"Mountain View, CA",101,751,739.0,4.0,2015-06-07,"Surprisingly, this place was packed around 1pm on a Sunday afternoon, though we didn't wait at all for a table. I don't remember being enchanted with CPK on my one or two visits to the chain, but I very much enjoyed the food we had this meal: we shared a The Works pizza, which includes sausage, pepperoni, olives, onions, and peppers and a full size roasted veggie salad. They ask if you want complimentary bread, which of course I accepted. The oil and herb mixture they offer for dipping is very savory, fragrant, and tasty. I have actually found myself thinking about it since my meal here and contemplating how to recreate it at home. I liked the saltiness of the meats on the pizza. Most of all, I liked how the pizza wasn't overladen with cheese and the thin, crispiness of the crust. It's fun and all to see strings of cheese dripping of pizza, but to eat it that way actually grosses me out. CPK has a lighter, more appetizing take on pizza. The roasted veggie salad consisted of a spring mix with avocado, asparagus, artichoke, and other yummy greens. I might ask for a bit lighter hand with the balsamic dressing next time, but the salad was overall tasty and with added protein would definitely satisfy as a meal by itself.

70,Jessica H.,"San Mateo, CA",0,3,,5.0,2015-06-25,"Yesterday was my first time at California Pizza Kitchen. All I have to say is WOW. Everything was great. I am a picky eater and I have to say that the food was excellent. Not only was the food very good, the customer service provided at CPK was very welcoming and it was very much appreciated.  We went in around 715 and we were told the wait was about 10-15 so of course we decided to wait. My friend wanted to look at the menu so when he asked the hostess, she was rude. She just handed him the menu without even looking at him with a smile or anything. This left a horrible impression and I was already dissatisfied. I used to work in a restaurant so I know how important first impressions are and hers was not great. I would recommend getting rid of her because she gave a bad vibe upon 10 mins being there especially that we were first timers. I will not go on about her because the rest of the staff was truly great. We were seated after 10 mins like we were told. The name of the server we had was Gianna. She was amazing. She was very helpful with her suggestions and she really made us feel welcomed. You could tell that she likes her job and she was not bothered no matter how many questions we asked. I loved her customer service and I hope we get her again. The hostess should take a couple tips from Gianna.  We were told if we sign up for the rewards, we would receive a free small plate. We got the Shaved Mushroom and Spinach flat bread. It was DELICIOUS. The name of the manager that was working was Becky.  She was super nice and friendly. You could tell that she was loved her job as well. She brought us the flat bread which was surprising because managers usually sit there and dont send food. She was very active and we really felt welcomed by her. Its nice to see that even though she is a manager, She still cared to help the servers. We were also served bread and it was soo yummy. The oil with spices was just amazing.  For the Entree we ordered the California Cobb Salad and Half Tostada pizza and half California Club. It was amazing. There are no words to describe how good the pizza was. Throughout our entire dinner, Gianna was checking on us and getting a refill and just all around great.  Towards the end of the meal, We were so full we did not want to get up and walk. Becky the manager came up and checked on us again. It was so sweet that a manager showed how much she cared about our first time here. She offered us a free dessert but we declined since we were so full. It was really sweet of her and we appreciate the amazing customer service. Both Becky and Gianna really made our first time here amazing and totally made us forget about the rude hostess. We will be back very soon and I will make sure to bring in my family and friends that have never been here before.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-mateo?start=60,3.2,3.35,3.35,2.804,3.29

Turns out EVERYONE had the same idea. CPK is packed with families and there are a dozen more waiting. There are two of us so we could have sat at the bar but it basically looked like sitting in the kitchen, so we waited. And waited. And waited. We finally got probably the worst two-top in the place, right next to the seats we'd rejected. Ha! Next to one of the waiter stations. We cajoled our way into a better seat but were clearly hated for asking. No matter. We were in a nice booth and could rest after a long shopping spree. I ordered a glass of wine and they ask if you want small or large. HUH? Regular glass of wine, which one is regular? 6 oz or 9 oz is the answer. Good lord. My friend ordered a Corona and I kid you not, the waiter brought a 24 oz giant bottle! She said ""oh, I had no idea it was a giant bottle."" We're totally mystified as the waiter knows that it's just the two of us girls. ""I can't drink all this, I wish you would have said something,"" she says. To which the waiter shrugs and says something about thinking we wanted to party. UGH. I've eaten at lots of CPKs and -- for a chain restaurant -- it's quite good. Crispy crust, regular pizzas, the signature dishes, big salads, I love it all. But this particular one needs to be cleaned and/or remodeled. It has that gross dirty carpet smell that puts me right back in college to my days waiting tables. It's the way a lot of places smell before they start cooking the food. But when you're sitting right next to the kitchen in full swing, and it smells like dirty carpet, it makes you wonder just how filthy it is.

I've only ever ordered the pizzas so I can't really review their pastas/salads/whatever else they serve. We usually get a California Club pizza, though we've tried a few other ones like the teriyaki, the mushroom and sausage, and some of the seasonal ones (one had artichoke, egg, and potatoes!). The California Club is by far my favorite -- it feels like a healthier version of pizza. They're generous with the veggies that they top it with.  One pizza's ~$15 and we usually share. Between the pizza and the free bread they serve at the beginning, it's sufficiently filling for dinner.  They can get really, really busy around lunch time. A lot of families will stop in before or after a day of shopping, so it gets especially crowded on the weekends. I'd give them 5/5 but service is really hit or miss, sometimes they're really on top of everything and other times (especially when it's really busy) it can get difficult to flag down someone to refill your water or close your check.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-mateo?start=60,3.24,3.29,3.088,2.32,3.27

There are a few go-to menu items I rotate through and I like the general consistency and quality in most CPK locations. Located in the Hillsdale mall, where the food court is currently under renovation, this CPK tends to get very busy. Add in the holiday shoppers and well, you can only imagine the wait times (both for seating and food.)  The food was perfectly fine (I got the California veggie on thin crust-their thin crust is always on point for me) and they kept the free bread coming. Our server was amazing-she kept checking on us and letting us know of delays in our food coming out. Drinks were refilled promptly and she kept her cool on what appeared to be an extremely busy Saturday. At 3:30-ish, the restaurant was nearly full but she did an amazing job of being sure we were taken care of. There were a few improvements to the overall experience that made this a 3 star rating instead of 4. First of all the ""waiting area"" is pretty much non-existent. The hostess stand is outside the front door in the mall itself. If you're put on the list to wait, there are only a few places to sit-otherwise patrons jam up in the doorway or awkwardly stand in the mall. Second, they have a few booths very close to the kitchen and the passageway to and from. We had the misfortune of being seated there. Not only did we see the messy kitchen floor, but we also had servers bustling past us or congregating waiting for their orders to be up. We just felt like we had too much activity in our seating area and it was a bit unpleasant. Sure they'd lose some seats if they took those booths out but it's not a big loss considering how chaotic our dining experience was. Other than that it's what you'd expect from CPK.

My biggest complaint is that the last few times I've visited over the past year, the place smells more and more like a cafeteria. Honestly rank odor. I can't imagine the managers haven't noticed it, which means that corporate is being stingy with money for basic maintenance. Not sure if the Hillsdale remodel scared away all their great help, but there weren't many people working tables, the manager was great and kept things going, but he seemed a bit panicked. Maybe a few staff didn't show. Whatever, I got the feeling this last time that they were understaffed. Still, the food was excellent and came out promptly. The waiter was good, but overwhelmed so I had to flag him down to get anything. Luckily, I'm assertive when late, so I got out of there in a reasonable amount of time. That being said, the restaurant was probably no more than half full. Probably due to the remodel at Hillsdale, but still. I got the feeling that corporate had abandoned this property. I mean, a tear in the seats of the booth patched with electrical tape? Come on. How much does that cost to fix? Wondering if they are waiting for a remodel, because the place has gotten very shabby. I hope they are planning on investing in this property or perhaps CPK is going by the way of Pasta Pomodoro. Same problems are arising at CPK as happened with PP it its last years.

16,Jenn M.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",1,72,49.0,3.0,2017-03-31,Three stars because the in dining is great. I ordered a chinese chicken salad and it was delicious. I was on a crunch for time so I decided to do a pick up order and it was greatly disappointing. The chinese chicken salad is supposed to come with cabbage but they gave me wilted lettuce and the chicken was rubbery - as if it wasn't cooked all the way. I was looking forward to eating this salad after a great first experience but now I would probably never get it again...I guess unless it is in dining.

Love love love their food, and they always give me excellect service with one or two exception, but this review is based on my visit today. I asked the server to give me pepper (I actually meant black pepper) but she gave me red pepper flakes but it was fine because it made the pizza even better.  Pros: Excellent customer service, the girl that served me and my mom was super nice and helpful. And she was attentive.  Food tasted the same Presentation actually got better than the times I've been there.  Portions are consistent  Cons: The Moroccan salad was underdressed and had so little butter nut squash and lack of avocado, and had less dates than the times I had it(I eat this every time I go there so believe me I know it tasted different. Thus, the salad was not mixed well which caused a bite can be all nuts.  Found a eyebrow on the avocado, not sure was mine or the cook's, so I can't make this reason to give them a 4 stars.  What threw me off was the restroom. Me and my mom decided to use it before we leave because it is usually cleaner than the restroom at the mall, but not this time. When I opened the door, I had to close it immediately because it smelled so HORRIBLE! It smelled worse than a dumbster I'm telling you...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-mateo,2.24,2.67,3.004,,2.498

6,Kelly D.,"San Francisco, CA",0,3,,4.0,2017-09-30,"Before CPK's renovations, I didn't love the restaurant honestly. I thought the food/service was okay, but not a place I'd think of going to all the time. But now, my mind has changed! It took a little bit longer to get seated than what the host told us. She had to come up to get our phone number twice and then we got the text that our table was ready like ten minutes late the second time around. So overall, it was a 35 minute wait that was supposed to be 20 like she said. Not a huge deal since they hadn't used iPads before so I'm sure some mistakes will be made.  Everything else was pretty much uphill from there! Service was kind and quick. Only thing was when we asked for bread, we were only given four pieces for a family of four lol. One each didn't really suffice haha. The spicy buffalo cauliflower (which is new to the menu) is AMAZING. Perfect appetizer. I ordered the limited time only, shrimp scampi pizza, and I hope they bring it back/make it permanent some day, it was delicious. And the new cucumber reviver was very cooling and refreshing! The presentation of everything is definitely a lot better than before as well. I'm glad they took the time to improve because I'll definitely be coming back more often!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-san-mateo,2.64,2.72,3.032,,2.688

However, there was a long line of high school kids that were in line so, as respectful members of society, we waited our turn. As we stood in line I see the table that they had set aside for us, broken apart to accommodate those in front of us. Wow!!! I was told that they would have our table ready in 5 minutes... 40 minutes later... finally, seated. I had asked to speak to the manager but was never approached by him, Mark (the usual manager, Kimi Green, was not at the restaurant that day).  We probably should have left but stayed because it was my niece's birthday and we had the grandparents with us too. Terrible... just terrible, CPK!

A really nice lady helped me over the phone but when I asked her where the curbside pick up area was she didn't know because it's like a call center so she's not working at the location I called. Anyways, I found it and called once I got there to have them bring out the order. I took away stars because once I got home I noticed something had leaked on my seat. Once opening the bag I noticed it was the oil they give you for bread. I have never been given oil for my bread, only butter, and even then they put it inside the bag w/the bread. If they would've done that it wouldn't have leaked on my seat.
