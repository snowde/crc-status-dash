105,Erin C.,"Temecula, CA",68,334,26.0,3.0,2012-02-02,"Came here about a week ago to have lunch with some girlfriends. I was actually really surprised that the place was not busy at all for lunchtime on a Saturday, especially since this is a mall location. A couple of us ordered salads and a couple of us ordered tacos. I thought my salad was just fine, the server got my requests right (no bleu cheese, dressing on the side) and he was prompt with drink refills. I just thought the food wasn't that good. The ladies that ordered tacos liked them a lot. I don't make it a habit to come to any CPK location and this experience did nothing to help or hurt that opinion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-ana?start=160,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003

The order took about 20 minutes to be ready which consisted of a medium BBQ pizza, a full order of the chopped salad and a half order of the roasted vege salad. First off my vege salad was really good, it has corn, artichoke hearts, eggplant, red  and yellow peppers on a green salad with balsamic vinaigrette dressing...I could do without the artichoke hearts. The salad was quite big for a half, more then enough. My friends got a med BBQ pizza and shared a full order of the chopped salad. For a medium pizza, its pretty small and a little expensive for the size. The chopped salad was good, I was told, and it was quite big.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-ana?start=160,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003

88,Connie C.,"Orange County, CA",633,392,1135.0,2.0,2012-03-31,"The restaurant is located in between Nordstrom and Macy's. The place is smaller than other CPK restaurants. The inside is pretty nice and colorful.  What I ordered was the following: 1. Spaghetti bolognese-This was salty and bland. The meat and the tomatoes tasted very fresh though.  2. Bread with butter-Better than the CPK in Brea...The bread was soft, but the butter was a bit hardened still.  3. White corn guacamole with chips-The guacamole was my favorite, very refreshing and good! The chips were stale...that was the down side... Service here was ok. I guess because it was weird when one of the chefs brought me a dish and I could not understand him at all...I would think that the servers would be doing that...I'm confused about their duties for their titles. The check took forever...so the manager took the tab instead of my own server. (My server only had three tables...they were couples and myself...)

Our pizzas did take awhile to come out but thats okay. we were filling up on the artichoke dip, which was DELICIOUS by the way!!  As for the pizzas we ordered: Chipotle Chicken Pizza: Spicy chipotle sauce, chicken, mild chilies, Mozzarella and Enchilado cheese. Topped with roasted corn & black bean salsa, cilantro and lime cream sauce. This was awesome!!  Loved the spicy kick to it and I am one to not eat spicy.  Loved the thickness of the pizza too Pesto Chicken Thin Crust: Pesto chicken, onions, Mozzarella, sun-dried tomatoes, basil pesto sauce and toasted pine nuts.  We requested to have half the pine nuts on one side of the pizza.  Alina was not sure if they could do that but she asked and she delivered!  Thanks!!

My friend and i went on a bit of a chilly evening. We were concerned about having to sit out on the patio since they were pretty busy that night. The manager assured us that it would be comfortable since there are heat lamps placed out there. We sat directly beneath the lamp, and proved right.  A few minutes later, our server appears, and he just looks and acts like he really doesn't want to be there at all. He didn't introduce himself at all, and the only reason we knew what his name was, was because of the fact that the manager had stated ""so n so will be here shortly"".  Luckily, the food was really delicious, and the manager was a complete doll. Maybe he could pass along the good manners to this particular staff member.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-ana?start=120,3.4,3.4,3.4,2.6079999999999997,3.4000000000000004
154,Michelle P.,"West Covina, CA",220,248,218.0,3.0,2012-04-14,"One of the better lunch spots in the area, is pretty much consistent with other CPKs.  Feeling adventurous, I decided to give their new small bites menu a try.  Korean Bbq Tacos: Not bad. These had more of szechuan flavor than a bulgogi flavor. I would have preferred they put kimchi in it, but really what am I expecting from an americanized place. They were pretty saucy.  Macaroni and Cheese: The were in nugget form. I wasn't expecting them to do that. Instead of a bowl of mac and cheese they came out with four deep fried mac and cheese nuggets. I felt like I should have a side of ketchup or ranch with them, they were so awkward. Never again.  Avocado Egg Rolls - Sooo good. Might be the avocado bias, but I really enjoyed these.  Service was fast and friendly. The wait is also not so bad for lunch area.

119,Travis B.,"Orange, CA",143,168,16.0,1.0,2012-04-22,"I was very hungry and decided to order take out from this place which was a BIG mistake to say the least. I called CPK (which apparently is a call center) and they asked if they could put me on hold so I said OK. Someone else then picked up the phone and told me the exact same thing, I said OK again. Finally the original girl gets back on the phone and begins to take my order. I mentioned something as I was ordering and obviously she was per-occupied because she replied with something that had nothing to do with what I asked. Anyways my order was finished and I was on my way to pickup my curbside order. I show up to CPK and it so happened someone was just picking up their order so it was perfect I did not have to call for the server to come out. She asked my name which I gave along with my credit card to pay. She comes back outside and says they have no record of my order in their system and she accidentally charged my card ($65) for someone else's order! (Mind you my order would have been bout $13) By this time I'm extremely agitated, turn off my car take out my two year old daughter and walk inside to ask for the manager, Anthony who looked like he was expecting me and seemed annoyed. He said the money had been refunded and if I'd like to place an order he would gladly do so. I told Anthony I wanted him to call my card company to have the funds released, he sighed and rudely told me he needed my card again so he could call the card company. About 15 minutes go by and the manager Anthony comes back and says ""like I told you before your card had the money put back towards it"". The manager, Anthony still makes no effort to offer any shape or form of compensation which made matters worse. Being the responsible adult I am, I turned around and kindly walked out the door. I will never go back to this CPK, I will gladly drive the extra 5 minutes to eat at the one in Irvine or Tustin. I can't believe they would higher managers such as Anthony given the excellent reputation of this restaurant chain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-ana?start=160,3.24,3.24,3.24,2.244,3.2400000000000007
99,Jessica V.,"Fountain Valley, CA",126,121,213.0,4.0,2012-05-01,What we usually get: - jambalaya pasta - snack size quesadilla - bbq chicken pizza - chipotle chicken pizza I'm in love with the jambalaya here. I always get it because I have a hard time trying something new. Sometimes I want a pizza so I'm caught in a dilemma but luckily I go with the bf most of the time and he always orders a pizza so I get the best of both worlds. Yay! Bbq chicken pizza is our favorite pizza here. It never disappoints and the flavor is still brought out even though I drown it with red pepper flakes! Chipotle pizza is our second favorite! We have a hard time deciding between the two sometimes! The snack size quesadillas are impressive. They pack a lot of flavor! Wish they weren't so small! Service varies. Can be slow sometimes... Service was once so slow that they comped a few of our dishes and gave us some percentage off.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-ana?start=80,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.6079999999999997,3.2000000000000006

We ended up moving two tables together and had a nice spot near the window, where we saw the weather improve slightly throughout our meal. Our server was nice - although one of my co-workers who sat next to me was slightly irked that he gave her no lemon in her water when she asked for some and then gave her a to-go box when she didn't want one. The young restaurant manager also came around to greet us near the end. That was nice; I think many restaurants are implementing that practice now to improve customer service. I ended up ordering the asparagus and spinach spaghettini with shrimp ($15). It looked delicious. Taste-wise, the shrimps and veggies were yummy but the spaghettini itself tasted a little bland. Maybe it was because I asked for no Parmesan? The portion was a little small for the price - I gobbled it all up in no time! I love asparagus and spinach, and I wished there was more of both.

We ordered the Original BBQ Chicken Pizza ($13) and two items from the small cravings menu - The Wedge Salad ($5) and the Quesadilla ($5) The BBQ Chicken Pizza was really disappointing...maybe I'm spoiled by Stonefire's pizzas but this lacked flavor. I would not recommend it and would not order it again. The Wedge Salad was DRENCHED in dressing...I guess I should've ordered the dressing on the side. I was disappointed and the flavor of the dressing was kind of bleh. The Quesadilla was the best thing we ordered, it was just decent.  The service was ok, our waiter ignored us a little bit but he looked miserable so I'll cut him some slack.

Although I didnt try everyone else's food, they ordered a variety of things.  Pasta, sandwiches, salads, pizza .. I didnt see anything that didnt look hella good. The only things i didnt like about the restaurant was that the ranch was NOT great, and the pizzas only come in personal size so if you come with a few people it could get more expensive than the average pizza place.

You didn't order enough bread, had a busy day and ran out so the best substitute is now a charge? The manager dropped by and asked how things were. I brought it up and he said yes, ""the company changed the policy and no more pita bread as a substitute.""

The pizza arrived next and I could really taste the wild mushrooms cheese and was so delish.

The wait time to be seated was about 8 minutes; not bad for a party of 6 considering it being a Sunday afternoon and St. Patricks day.  The reason i am giving them 3 stars is because we waited about 1hr for our food! The server came about 30min into our wait saying he would be back with our food. Then about 20min later he comes back and apologizes for the wait. Letting us know that one of our orders was done wrong so they had to do it again.  He made up by bringing bread and making sure we got refills on our drinks. Finally the food came and it was as good as always. I usually order the Chicken Tequila Fettucini. It is delicious i would recommend it to anyone!!! All the other plates were great as well.  So overall they deserve 3 stars.

I would like to share my distasteful experience here in hopes of returning back to CPK one day. I When I walked in, I was enthusiastically greeted by the host and was directed to my seat. As usual, I was provided with a menu and asked what I wanted to drink. When it came around to order, I ordered the asparagus and spinach spaghettini. I also ordered their salted caramel pudding for dessert.  When I received my spaghetti, I found the outside peel of a garlic glove. That didn't bother me too much. I had completed my stay here with the final check and left. My stay was done here....not so fast.  A couple hours later, I started experiencing stomach pain. My stomachache lasted several hours into the night and I had trouble sleeping. Finally at 6 am, I threw up all of the asparagus and spinach spaghettini. I had gotten food poisoning from my meal here. I called the store that morning and informed the manager about my food poisoning. He apologized and told me that I would be refunded. I thanked him and hung up the phone. Few weeks went by and I didn't see a refund and kind of forgot about it.  For some reason, I still have a grudge against this restaurant. I guess I'm just disappointed that this restaurant doesn't really value their customers and doesn't take more safety precautions to keep their customers safe.

Second batch, bread was much softer and warm. The oil that it came with was okay...I've had better.

We always want the customer happy."" I said oh thank you! Thats so nice of you. Turns out, they ring in two lettuce wraps 20 dollars total and comp one which is the one that had the hair in it. So I told her, you didn't  comp the dish you charged me for two and comp'd the one that was messed up on and gave me 20% off which is 5 bucks (when lettuce wrap is $10)  she said she would have it corrected and she came back and discounted the lettuce wrap but removed the 20%. I never asked for any discount to begin with, the fact that I was not happy is because she emphasized she is comping the appetizer AND giving us 20% (going above and beyond I thought) and turns out she only kept her word on one.

It took quite awhile for us to get our drinks then the bread seemed to take some time to arrive (we had to ask twice). I ordered a salad with my meal with ranch and when I got the salad it was like they just waved the dressing over the plate. I asked for some extra dressing and it took FOREVER for them to bring me the dressing (another server had to finally get that for me). When we finally got our main course (that once again took a long time) it was kind of dumped on the table and the server left without asking if we needed anything else. My wife ordered the chicken piccata with pasta and unfortunately her meal came with something extra, a long black hair wrapped in spaghetti noodle (my wife has blonde hair). They did ask if she wanted another meal or dessert but by that time her stomach had turned and we asked for the bill.

33,Maria R.,"Seattle, WA",86,221,397.0,3.0,2015-11-23,"Oddly enough, the first time I ever went to CPK was when I lived in Atlanta, Georgia. That means I have loved their BBQ chicken chopped salad for 15 years or more. Since we're visiting family in Cali, I was excited that they chose to meet at CPK because I hadn't been to one since those days in the A-T-L.  We arrived around 4:15 and it took them a few minutes to set up the tables for nine of us. Over the next hour or so the restaurant filled up, but at the time we ordered, the place was about 1/3 full. Bread with olive oil and the appetizers we ordered came out quickly, but there was a long wait between appetizers and our entrees.  Our waitress was thrown off her game a little when she accidentally spilled a large soda and it splattered all over the table and some of us. It took a while to clean up and after that she seemed a bit sheepish, although she was very attentive to our drink refill requests.  I would recommend CPK of you have 1. a lot of time and 2. a large family or kids. Overall the process of getting your food takes a while. And it's so loud in there that it doesn't matter if your kids are being loud, it just adds to the noise. It was perfect for us because there were two little ones and two teens in our party. But I remember seeing dismayed looks on couples' faces - maybe at not having received their food or because they couldn't hold a conversation with each other.  Overall it was great to spend time with family, but the speed and execution of the service could stand improvement. The reason I'm giving three stars instead of two: the BBQ Chicken Salad is just as delicious as it was all those years ago.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-ana?start=20,3.36,3.17,3.17,2.8920000000000003,3.246

We're Asian so while we're actually all in our early 20s, we look probably like mid-teens. I feel like our appearances factored into our treatment. We were seated by a lovely older group and there was another older couple across from us. The couple beside us was helped at least twice as often as us, and the waitress would glance at us and then skip over us to the other table across to ask about how they were doing. I had to flag them down to get refills on drinks, bread, and spoons because our plates of food didn't come with spoons like usual. Kat was our waitress and while we had to flag her down to get things, she had an amicable personality.  The fettuccine was a little bland this time, and I usually love it. They were generous with the shrimp though! The pesto penne on the other hand had only a bare sprinkling of tomatoes (my favorite part). It's kind of hit and miss with how much tomatoes are given in the penne dishes as far as my experience goes.  The bolognese and asparagus spaghettini were delicious except my cousin said that the chicken was salty. It surprised me that she had a complaint because she's really easy to please with food lol. The receipt given didn't outline the breakdown of costs as well which was weird. Overall, it was an average experience. The food was simply okay, despite spending $100+ for the entirety. With that much, I would expect a better experience like CPK usually offers me. The service was lackluster as well, and there wasn't the excuse of a busy night, which I always take into consideration when rating service.

My group of co-workers thought it would be a good and quick place to get lunch today. Man, were we wrong. Two of my co-workers in our group got their orders messed up. One asked for no blue cheese on their salad, and they got blue cheese. The other co-worker asked for avocado in her salad, and didn't have any avocado. Since we couldn't find our waiter, we tried to get an employee's attention. Once we told her the situation, she didn't apologize that the orders were wrong. She just said I'll take care of it. And thankfully she did correct the situation. But the server never came back and never apologized for the error. That annoyed me because he should have at least apologized for getting both of the orders wrong and that did not happen. Not only that, when we got the check, the waiter messed up on the check too. My one co-worker that got blue cheese on her salad got charged twice: once for the first salad that was wrong and the second one for the new salad. First of all, that is not right. Both salads that were wrong for both my co-workers should have been comped. But they weren't. That made me even more annoyed than before. And once I realized the error in the check, it took 15 mins. for us to find our server again and have him correct it. And then it took forever for him to come back to actually pick up the check and bring it back. We waited for so long that I was just getting more upset. I work for an institution that holds customer service in the highest regard and it is our top priority. I can tell you right now that this place does not care one iota about the service they give.

We were served bread and given our drinks as we waited for our orders. Our waitress always refilled out water cups and I could find no issue with the service given that day. I had to take off 1 star though because I thought the Mac and cheese would be an actual Mac and cheese and not these tiny Mac and cheese bites.

The only good things were... - The taste of the water - The starter bread & oil - The add on grilled shrimp for the salad (cooked to perfection) They have this high wall, with a low opening below eye level, that the hostess has to peek thru to figure out where to seat you.  - It feels awkward - Feels bad she has to crouch down  - Perhaps they should get rid of that thing and just put in a nice plant or something with ease at eye level; or a system where you can easily figure out which tables are avail Their Hawaiian Pizza is soggy (slightly warmed up, cools fast) flat dough, only the crust is chewy and cooked thru. There is a slight stain of tomato and then thin slices of ham and pineapple.  - where's the pizza sauce and cheese?

Pros: - Like most CPKs you receive complimentary bread & garlic/basil oil for dipping. - The food is pretty consistent and delicious, especially the pizza options and my favorite pasta to get from this location is the Chicken Tequila Pasta. - CPK has lunch specials from 11am-4pm Monday through Friday where you can have a half sandwich or small order of their pizza paired with a soup or salad and you can add chicken to your salad as well. Cons: - In the beginning we may have been sat down quick but it did take about 15 minutes to have the opportunity to order drinks, but after that the service was phenomenal! - The menus are grimy, damp, and had leftover sauce in them (view pic). - The bathrooms were not the cleanest. Overall, it's a mall located restaurant so it receives plenty of traffic but I'd hope they could give their patrons some cleaner menus.

0,Jane L.,"Orange County, CA",2,41,16.0,4.0,2018-01-03,"I am a long time CPK fan. From a lifetime in jersey to now here in California. Although it's a chain, I would say each location ranges highly in atmosphere, service, and even food.  I like this location at The Main Place Mall. You don't have to be at the mall or even go inside to eat at the CPK. Its easily accessible from the front entrance up the big ramp. It has its own entrance so you don't have to pass through the mall at all. I'm not sure why I am going on and on about this except that trying to find a restaurant in a mall can be intimidating if traveling with young children or annoying if you are in a rush. Anyhoo, this location is spacious and has a bright atmosphere. Its not as cool and modern as the location at Anaheim Garden Walk but the parking is a bit easier and the food is infinitely better. I also prefer it over the one at Brea Mall which has way tighter seating and has a dark atmosphere as well as a long wait most of the time. I've been to the one at Main Place at least twenty times and waited maybe once.  Out of those 20-30 times I have never received poor service. They are always friendly and pretty quick with the food. If it gets busy you might have to flag someone down but thats not a big deal for me.  Pizzas are all pretty good. Its really personal preference. I am a thin crust kind of gal and love their roasted artichoke and spinach. Their tostado pizza is also yummy. The flame roasted salsa they give with it is yuuuummy.  I love a bunch of their pastas. Bolognese obviously a safe bet. Pesto cream penne tastes really good with shrimp or chicken but is heavy. Garlic cream fettuccini also yummy but heavy. If you are looking for lighter they have a relatively new pasta called Wild mushroom strozzapreti but i ordered it twice and the first time i loved it but second time was blah. The lightest pasta is the shrimp scampi zucchini but its light because they give like four fettuccine noodles so I feel cheated.  My favorite appetizer is the spinach artichoke dip but they are all pretty good. They have super huge fresh salads you can share. They got rid of my favorite spinach salad so second for me is the California Cobb but I am not a salad expert. I have yet to try a main plate or power bowl. I never ordered a small bite at this location so not sure if they have them?? but those are awesome to add. CPK used to have this spicy chicken quesadilla on their small bites menu which came with a sauce on the side - the dish was to die for but they discontinued it. Bring it baaaack! I'd say this is one of the better CPK locations in the area so give it a try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-ana,3.28,3.3,3.3,,3.2920000000000003
