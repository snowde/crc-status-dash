222,Amanda I.,"Kalamazoo, United States",242,358,595.0,2.0,2012-05-08,"I'm only going to give this restaurant two stars because I sort of like the food, especially the little appetizer plates they've started to offer. And that's where it ends. I can't give it more because of the Joe, the host they have (or hopefully, had) working as a host. And his manager, who would rather defend him and his crappy behavior than listen to a customer.  My fiance and I went on a Friday night for some dinner and told Joe we'd like to go sit at the bar. However, when we went to the bar it was full so we came back to the front so he asked us if we'd like to wait for something at the bar to open up or sit at a table. While he was asking us, another couple walked in behind us; my fiance and I barely had time to look at each other and decide, and didn't even get the chance to answer when Joe was already walking off with the couple that had just walked in to seat them at a table. WTF? Seriously, he didn't give us 2 seconds to answer before he was seating people that came in after us and when we came back we were like, ""Dude, what the heck was that all about?"" And his excuse was that we didn't have an answer for him so he decided to just seat the other couple instead.  All I could do was look at him because I was so shocked by his rudeness and stupidity. So we walked out. I called the manager because I was so put off by this man's rudeness, tone, and attitude, and all she did was defend him and tell me how he always gets high secret shopper scores. Seriously Idiot? I worked in retail and trust me, you always, ALWAYS know when you're getting a secret shopper. Secret shoppers aren't that secret because they try too damn hard to act normal, you can point them out from a mile away.  Then, on what will be my last visit ever, I had the pleasure of meeting Joe again when my friends decided they wanted to meet me for dinner at CPK. We were told by Mr. Personality himself that it would be about a 30 minute wait. So we grabbed some chairs outside and waited for 35-40 minutes, even after we noticed that people who had come in after us were being seated. And when my friend, who was recovering from having pins stuck into his broken ankle, hobbled up and confronted Joe about it, the guy flat out lied to him and told him they had come in before us. Lies, lies, lies!  So my friend with the swollen ankle being fused together by metal asked Joe how much longer it would be before we were seated, his response, after he rolled his eyes, was ""30 seconds"". Oh haha, yes, very funny.  5 minutes later we eventually had a table. And I can't really remember what I ate, or if I liked it, or what my server was like because the most dominant memory I will always have of this place is the rude guy up at the front and the management that is happy to let him get away with it.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-barbara?start=80,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.8560000000000003,3.2800000000000002

It was about  a 15-minute wait during a Friday night dinner rush. Service was decent & I was happy to find out that bread is offered with meals. It's a small baguette, but this is a new addition that I liked. (Plus, the dipping oil with all the spices was yummy.) My hubby & I shared a pepperoni pizza with garlic & the tomato basil spaghettini with chicken breast (which was perfect for two people). The pizza was absolutely delicious! The pepperoni had just the right amount of spice, the crust was crispy but not burnt, perfection! (On a side note, why did they change their dough recipe? I remember it used to have a touch of sweetness, which I miss. But I digress.) The spaghettini definitely benefited from the chicken & their sauce was every bit as delish as I remembered it.

The crust was subpar, and it seemed to be mostly crust. And what else is there to really say? It's garlic and chicken. You can't screw that up! :) My girlfriend ordered the Jamaican jerk chicken pizza, on a 'regular crust' - as it used to be made before they switched to their thin crust. As our food came, they had made the wrong crust, and she was pretty bummed, so we waited for another pizza... Which she ended up getting once I had already finished my pizza. Not a huge deal, but still somewhat of annoyance.  Her mother ordered something that the waiter had specifically told her was not 'spicy'. I ended up trying it... Although not 'spicy' it was definitely 'hot', like a wasabi hot. Definitely gross nonetheless, and again, had to get another plate of chicken without the sauce.  All in all, pretty decent service for being a Saturday night. Food all in all... Meh. I'm not a huge fan of CPK.

We had a bit of a spinach and artichoke themed dinner which we didn't even realize until the waitress was like ""wow! u girls sure are spinach lovers"" LOL! I was a bit annoyed at first because we went to CPK and put our name down and they told us there would be a 25 minute wait, so we went to Sephora to spend the time and came back 5 minutes or so before it was supposed to be our turn but then we went back up to them they said they had called our name 20 minutes ago??? That was pretty strange and so we ended up having to wait longer and the host person just came off a bit rude.. Anyway though, once we were seated our waitress was really sweet and nice and helpful so I would still say the service was generally good. For appetizers we ordered spinach and artichoke dip and the crispy mac and cheese. Both were good, but we weren't too impressed by the mac and cheese things and probably wouldn't order it again. The dip was really yummy though! Then for the entree we got a thin crust spinach and artichoke pizza and I really liked that too! My roommates mostly ordered the food because I didn't have much preference but I didn't expect to like the spinach and artichoke stuff as much as I did. I like spinach, but have never been a fan of too much cheese or artichoke in food, but it was all actually really delicious! This was definitely enough food for the three of us, we were completely stuffed afterwards. Also the price was reasonable considering!

37,Stuti A.,"Cupertino, CA",6,11,3.0,4.0,2015-05-04,"Me and the roomies went to CPK for dinner this past Saturday. We had a bit of a spinach and artichoke themed dinner which we didn't even realize until the waitress was like ""wow! u girls sure are spinach lovers"" LOL! I was a bit annoyed at first because we went to CPK and put our name down and they told us there would be a 25 minute wait, so we went to Sephora to spend the time and came back 5 minutes or so before it was supposed to be our turn but then we went back up to them they said they had called our name 20 minutes ago??? That was pretty strange and so we ended up having to wait longer and the host person just came off a bit rude.. Anyway though, once we were seated our waitress was really sweet and nice and helpful so I would still say the service was generally good. For appetizers we ordered spinach and artichoke dip and the crispy mac and cheese. Both were good, but we weren't too impressed by the mac and cheese things and probably wouldn't order it again. The dip was really yummy though! Then for the entree we got a thin crust spinach and artichoke pizza and I really liked that too! My roommates mostly ordered the food because I didn't have much preference but I didn't expect to like the spinach and artichoke stuff as much as I did. I like spinach, but have never been a fan of too much cheese or artichoke in food, but it was all actually really delicious! This was definitely enough food for the three of us, we were completely stuffed afterwards. Also the price was reasonable considering! I've always loved CPK and this was another good trip :^)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-barbara?start=20,3.32,3.5,3.5,3.6,3.4280000000000004

The pizza came out and we both took one bite and choked on the amount of salt burning down our esophagus.

Floor manager has been there way to long, and has a chip on her shoulder, never smiles, and looks like she's miserable ALL the time. Maybe it's time for an upgrade. Only thing that kept me coming back is the super nice and attentive folks at the pick up counter. But now they recently changed their chicken on some items and the BBQ chicken chopped from a rotisserie type to a charred disaster that is hard, dry, and tastes like it was literally on fire... I asked for fresh chicken, and was brought the same exact chicken that looked at tasted like it was made last week...the waitress was new and embarrassed, so had the manager come by, she insisted at my table side that it was fresh, but you could tell it was straight out of a fridge, it was ice cold, and she was so confrontational that I just let it go. At $14.00 for a salad, the chicken better be orgasmic. On the same salad they also changed the cubed jicama to this shredded limp noodle resembling, no flavor, gross, wasted money of an ingredient I've ever tasted. Been my fav salad for 10 years, and the floor manager made me feel like I was being ridiculous when I talked to her about the chicken, and jicama, that looked more like cheese than a veggie, not only that, but I asked what was in a drink before I ordered it, they failed to mention it had ginger, when I asked, the bar manager said no, it didn't have ginger after I tasted it and knew it did.

Floor manager has been there way to long, and has a chip on her shoulder, never smiles, and looks like she's miserable ALL the time. Maybe it's time for an upgrade. Only thing that kept me coming back is the super nice and attentive folks at the pick up counter. But now they recently changed their chicken on some items and the BBQ chicken chopped from a rotisserie type to a charred disaster that is hard, dry, and tastes like it was literally on fire... I asked for fresh chicken, and was brought the same exact chicken that looked at tasted like it was made last week...the waitress was new and embarrassed, so had the manager come by, she insisted at my table side that it was fresh, but you could tell it was straight out of a fridge, it was ice cold, and she was so confrontational that I just let it go. At $14.00 for a salad, the chicken better be orgasmic. On the same salad they also changed the cubed jicama to this shredded limp noodle resembling, no flavor, gross, wasted money of an ingredient I've ever tasted. Been my fav salad for 10 years, and the floor manager made me feel like I was being ridiculous when I talked to her about the chicken, and jicama, that looked more like cheese than a veggie, not only that, but I asked what was in a drink before I ordered it, they failed to mention it had ginger, when I asked, the bar manager said no, it didn't have ginger after I tasted it and knew it did.

Thankfully this experience was a lot better than the last two, because I had always thought CPK was a good ""fast food"" option, and it was affirmed going here last night. My bro and I were seated at a 2 person booth.  We were offered fresh bread.  Our waitress was really nice (don't remember her name) and attentive.  I really loved my strawberry lemonade I got, and my bro tried it and liked it too! My bro ordered a four cheese and tomato pizza and seemed to enjoy it.  I got one of their seasonal specials, a curly pasta in a mushroom sauce.  Yummmm, it was so good!  My bro kept on stealing it from me so I had to give him some. I was really pleased with the amount of vegetarian options that CPK offers.  It makes me really happy to see restaraunts who are willing to serve all kinds of customers -- especially having one of their monthly specials be vegetarian (and marking what's vegetarian with a symbol on the menu)  I know that, in the future, I will come back to CPK if it's an option in the mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-barbara,2.44,3.23,3.23,2.8320000000000003,2.9139999999999997
