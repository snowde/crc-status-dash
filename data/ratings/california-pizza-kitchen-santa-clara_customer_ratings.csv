577,Patricia L.,"San Jose, CA",356,327,44.0,3.0,2012-03-06,"The bf and I were doing some shopping at Valley Fair and decided to stop by CPK for dinner. We were seated right away because we went on a Monday night. There's usually a wait on weekends though. These are the things we ordered for dinner: Avocado Club Egg Rolls (Avocado, chicken, tomato, Monterey Jack and applewood smoked bacon in a crispy wonton roll. The egg rolls are served with homemade ranchito sauce and herb ranch.) - YUM!! These were so good! I usually don't like avocado eggrolls but the addition of chicken and bacon made the eggrolls so tasty! Order these and you won't be sorry! Korean BBQ Steak Tacos (There are 2 tacos per order - Korean steak, Napa cabbage, Romaine lettuce, onions, scallions and cilantro on corn tortillas. The tacos are topped with spicy chili sauce and sesame seeds.) - The tacos were good but nothing to write home about. I did like the tangy marinade/sauce they used for the meat though. Chicken Lettuce Wraps (Minced chicken, wok-seared with Shiitake mushrooms, water chestnuts and scallions. The lettuce wraps are served with spicy soy-ginger sauce. You can also get shrimp instead of chicken or a combination of both.) - I ordered this as my entrée because I wasn't that hungry but it's a good amount of food. The lettuce wraps were good but nothing compared to my mom's recipe! Thai Crunch Salad (Napa & red cabbage, chicken, cucumbers, edamame, wontons, rice sticks, peanuts, cilantro, carrots and scallions tossed with lime-cilantro and Thai peanut dressing.) - The bf ordered this as his entrée and I've had it before. I'm not a huge fan of this salad. Maybe it's the dressing? Caribbean Sunset Sangria (The sangria is a blend of mango, apple, Ecco Domani Pinot Grigio, Malibu Passion Fruit Rum and DeKuyper Peachtree Schnapps.) The sangria was super sweet and just tasted like juice.  The menu items here are hit or miss. Some things are really good here while others are not up to par. I've also had the infamous BBQ Chicken Pizza and also didn't really like it...I've definitely had better elsewhere. Our server, Danielle, was excellent. She was fast, friendly, and efficient. She came by to make sure everything was okay and always made sure our drinks were filled. Overall, dinner was good. Not much to complain about.

It's a smaller location, but luckily we didn't have to wait since it was a weeknight. I didn't appreciate being seated at the second table to the outside door because it was super windy, and the waiters kept going in and out of this door. Not sure why, pick ups? Also, being seated here, our waitress wasn't super attentive, or was just super busy. Had to ask for utensils, plates, and the bread (the madre was starving), which should be pretty common things to give. When she finally gave us 3 slices of bread, I had to ask her for the utensils and plates as she walked away. Ridiculous. I normally order the garlic chicken pizza, but decided to change it up with the Jamacian Jerk pizza. When I asked her how it was, she said it was pretty sweet, but good. My mom ordered the jambalaya pasta, which I had remembered being good, and my dad ordered the steak tacos (he's an odd one). Our food came out, by another staf, and I sampled the jambalaya pasta first cuz they give you a ton! Pretty good, a bit on the salty side, but really liked the noodles. They were perfect al dente and width. My pizza was wayyyyyyy too sweet, but nothing a little ranch couldn't fix. Which another waitress brought. I think our waitress was being totally overworked? Not sure, but weird that she didn't come around much. My dad enjoyed his tacos, and they give you a good amount of blue and corn tortilla chips.  My waitress saw my soda was dwindling and that she'd bring me a new one. It took a good while before she brought one.  3 stars for the so-so service and seating us in the way back when there were other tables.

It's a smaller location, but luckily we didn't have to wait since it was a weeknight. I didn't appreciate being seated at the second table to the outside door because it was super windy, and the waiters kept going in and out of this door. Not sure why, pick ups? Also, being seated here, our waitress wasn't super attentive, or was just super busy. Had to ask for utensils, plates, and the bread (the madre was starving), which should be pretty common things to give. When she finally gave us 3 slices of bread, I had to ask her for the utensils and plates as she walked away. Ridiculous. I normally order the garlic chicken pizza, but decided to change it up with the Jamacian Jerk pizza. When I asked her how it was, she said it was pretty sweet, but good. My mom ordered the jambalaya pasta, which I had remembered being good, and my dad ordered the steak tacos (he's an odd one). Our food came out, by another staf, and I sampled the jambalaya pasta first cuz they give you a ton! Pretty good, a bit on the salty side, but really liked the noodles. They were perfect al dente and width. My pizza was wayyyyyyy too sweet, but nothing a little ranch couldn't fix. Which another waitress brought. I think our waitress was being totally overworked? Not sure, but weird that she didn't come around much. My dad enjoyed his tacos, and they give you a good amount of blue and corn tortilla chips.  My waitress saw my soda was dwindling and that she'd bring me a new one. It took a good while before she brought one.  3 stars for the so-so service and seating us in the way back when there were other tables. Prices here are fair, and I still love CPK, but won't get the Jamacian Jerk next time.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=120,3.56,3.31,3.56,2.8920000000000003,3.41

We were seated right away because we went on a Monday night. There's usually a wait on weekends though. These are the things we ordered for dinner: Avocado Club Egg Rolls (Avocado, chicken, tomato, Monterey Jack and applewood smoked bacon in a crispy wonton roll. The egg rolls are served with homemade ranchito sauce and herb ranch.) - YUM!! These were so good! I usually don't like avocado eggrolls but the addition of chicken and bacon made the eggrolls so tasty! Order these and you won't be sorry! Korean BBQ Steak Tacos (There are 2 tacos per order - Korean steak, Napa cabbage, Romaine lettuce, onions, scallions and cilantro on corn tortillas. The tacos are topped with spicy chili sauce and sesame seeds.) - The tacos were good but nothing to write home about. I did like the tangy marinade/sauce they used for the meat though. Chicken Lettuce Wraps (Minced chicken, wok-seared with Shiitake mushrooms, water chestnuts and scallions. The lettuce wraps are served with spicy soy-ginger sauce. You can also get shrimp instead of chicken or a combination of both.) - I ordered this as my entrée because I wasn't that hungry but it's a good amount of food. The lettuce wraps were good but nothing compared to my mom's recipe! Thai Crunch Salad (Napa & red cabbage, chicken, cucumbers, edamame, wontons, rice sticks, peanuts, cilantro, carrots and scallions tossed with lime-cilantro and Thai peanut dressing.) - The bf ordered this as his entrée and I've had it before. I'm not a huge fan of this salad. Maybe it's the dressing? Caribbean Sunset Sangria (The sangria is a blend of mango, apple, Ecco Domani Pinot Grigio, Malibu Passion Fruit Rum and DeKuyper Peachtree Schnapps.) The sangria was super sweet and just tasted like juice.  The menu items here are hit or miss. Some things are really good here while others are not up to par. I've also had the infamous BBQ Chicken Pizza and also didn't really like it...I've definitely had better elsewhere. Our server, Danielle, was excellent. She was fast, friendly, and efficient.

396,Cora W.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,6,,5.0,2013-01-07,"I know --- giving a chain 5 stars is strange, but we've had some extraordinary experience with my daughter's birthday party yesterday. Honestly, I didn't even know they offer kid's birthday party until I saw the tiny little flyer hanging outside their restroom. In short, the party started an hour before the restaurant opens, which was nice because we literally had the entire restaurants to ourselves. The kids were given a tour in the kitchen and its industrial walk-in fridge. Then the kids got to make their own pizza. By this time, the restaurant opened for lunch, so parents ordered food while the kids ate their own creations. After cake time, each kid was given a pencil and a coupon for a free kid's meal. The birthday kid gets a monogrammed chef coat.  A shout-out to the staff there, especially the manager Daniel and our server, Marla. Originally our party was set up at the patio. Since it was still early and the torch didn't warm up the place fast enough, Daniel asked his staff to move the party indoor. Some of the kids showed up late. Daniel was nice enough to offer a tour to the already excited kids and another one when more kids showed up. We had one guest who showed up 45 minutes late. I was about to tell her to order a kids meal since the rest were already eating until Marla offered her a personal tour and helped her with a personal pizza. I've got to admit some of the kids were not in their best behavior and literally trashed the space, and we were just so grateful for the staff's patience. At the end, we were even offered two pizzas to take home (I'm guessing they were from the extra two dough they had for the guests who didn't show up).  $10/kid is not bad at all, given the free kid's meal coupon is worth $6. I couldn't imagine doing this in our house. Consistently good food and exceptional service.

The lady grabbed a slice and almost put it in her mouth as she kept yapping all over the pizza. The guy comes back right before she took a bite and she placed the slice back on the plate. The guy takes it back and tells the mgr (we don't know what he said) the next thing you know he was heading back to our table and gave us the pizza. I said we weren'tgoing to accept the pizza since the lady already touched it and almost took a bite. This RUDE dingbat decides to ignore us and left tje pizza at our table. 5th - Our server finally came back and told her what happened. She was very apologetic and gave us a new pizza which should have been done in the first place.  Very very annoying experience. If you're going to eat here just keep an eye out to make sure you don't get food that other people already touchd and almost put in their mouth.

Honestly, I didn't even know they offer kid's birthday party until I saw the tiny little flyer hanging outside their restroom. In short, the party started an hour before the restaurant opens, which was nice because we literally had the entire restaurants to ourselves. The kids were given a tour in the kitchen and its industrial walk-in fridge. Then the kids got to make their own pizza. By this time, the restaurant opened for lunch, so parents ordered food while the kids ate their own creations. After cake time, each kid was given a pencil and a coupon for a free kid's meal. The birthday kid gets a monogrammed chef coat.  A shout-out to the staff there, especially the manager Daniel and our server, Marla. Originally our party was set up at the patio. Since it was still early and the torch didn't warm up the place fast enough, Daniel asked his staff to move the party indoor. Some of the kids showed up late. Daniel was nice enough to offer a tour to the already excited kids and another one when more kids showed up. We had one guest who showed up 45 minutes late. I was about to tell her to order a kids meal since the rest were already eating until Marla offered her a personal tour and helped her with a personal pizza. I've got to admit some of the kids were not in their best behavior and literally trashed the space, and we were just so grateful for the staff's patience. At the end, we were even offered two pizzas to take home (I'm guessing they were from the extra two dough they had for the guests who didn't show up).  $10/kid is not bad at all, given the free kid's meal coupon is worth $6.

Fatty foods & fruity alcoholic beverages, why not?? Not gonna lie, the best part about this place... their drinks! For those of you who'd rather taste the sweet calorie juices of a drink rather than the alcohol, they have it all here! It seems as if they added a little more to the menu, especially for beverages. I got the cooler sunrise sangria and the bestie got the passion fruit mojito. These were both hands down the best drinks we've had... And we've had A TON of drinks in our time :) Onto food: My usuals have always been the chipotle chicken pizza or BBQ chicken salad. Whenever I come with my sister, I ALWAYS have to steal a slice of her tostada pizza. Super fresh! Totally a fan of the corn guacamole sides, except the tortilla chips are a little too salty for my liking.  Minus one star for not so attentive servers.  Overall, easy accessible place to eat & catch up before or after a shopping trip.

It was my husbands bday and wanted to go CPK so we did. 1st issue - They said the wait was about 15 mins and the next thing you know it was 30 mins and just a few more minutes then it was 45. There were people who came after us that sat first. We were about ready to leave when they finally said the table was ready. 2nd - YAY! We're seated and finally ordered our drinks and food. Server was nice and got everything pretty quick. 3rd - Food came, not everything came. A few at a time which we didn't care much about. Problem was we didn't have any utensils or plates since we all decided to order food to share. We tried to get plates and utensils to no avail. It's like people just kept forgetting. 4th - Next thing you know a pizza that we ordered went to the next tabel. The lady grabbed a slice and almost put it in her mouth as she kept yapping all over the pizza. The guy comes back right before she took a bite and she placed the slice back on the plate. The guy takes it back and tells the mgr (we don't know what he said) the next thing you know he was heading back to our table and gave us the pizza. I said we weren'tgoing to accept the pizza since the lady already touched it and almost took a bite. This RUDE dingbat decides to ignore us and left tje pizza at our table. 5th - Our server finally came back and told her what happened. She was very apologetic and gave us a new pizza which should have been done in the first place.  Very very annoying experience.

91,Sean B.,"San Francisco, CA",2247,2841,1486.0,2.0,2014-01-07,"I mean, it's a chain restaurant in San Jose. So I went into it with low expectations. I really did. But for whatever reason my friend really wanted to go here tonight, so we ducked in while we waited for his iPhone to be repaired. I think he's just an Apple addict who wanted to be close-by in case something went wrong, so he could burn the case in effigy or something. He's kinda that guy. So in we went. I got a salad since I didn't want to do pizza at 7:45pm. A moment on the lips, a lifetime on the hips, and all that. He ordered a salmon dish from the ""light"" menu. We also had a special menu item, guacamole and chips, while we waited. The guacamole was bland. No other way to say it. Also, the portion was small enough that even though there were only about 15 chips on the plate, they outlasted the guacamole. I don't think this was a kitchen issue, it looked just like the picture on the menu. I just think that it's poorly conceptualized as an appetizer. The salad was just so-so. For the same price, the Cheesecake Factory, just down the hallway, is three times better and 50% bigger. My friend's salmon was just a bit dry and overcooked, and the portion was a little on the small side.  Disappointing to say the least; although again, pretty consistent with my experience of anything that's not pizza at CPK. The hosts and servers couldn't have been any nicer, which is why it's two and not one star, and I half-think that the kitchen did the best they could with uninspiring recipes and mediocre quality ingredients.

I'm not a huge fan of franchise restaurants, mainly because they all seem to have such generalized food that never really impresses, but CPK is a refreshing reanimation. This location is nice and spacious, not small and crowded like the ones in Hawaii, and the servers are extremely attentive. Speaking of, Nick, my server for a couple my visits, was GREAT!!! Since I was all alone, it was great that he didn't bug me too much but just made sure I had what I needed.  The food is pretty fantastic too. I had their BBQ Chicken Salad which was super tasty. the Sage and Truffle pizza was -Ah-MaZing and it's a good thing they keep that rich tasting pizza small, the corn/tortilla soup is okay but not amazing, the Lobster-mayo pizza is only good if you're a super fan of lobster and mayonnaise, and the Salted Caramel pudding is pretty yummy!! What I'm really saying is this: everything is spot-on delicious! I always tell myself to be more adventurous when I go to an old favorite spot, but sometimes that sentiment is hard to keep when going off-book ends in disappointment. Good thing CPK hasn't disappointed me yet!! I've been to several California Pizza Kitchens but none have impressed me like this location. Everyone up to the managers are crazy nice and super attentive.

824,Roberto Carlos ..,"San Francisco, United States",1,28,45.0,5.0,2014-02-08,"I used to wonder why a restaurant was always so busy. Was it due to the quality and selection of the food, the location, decore, lighting, ambiance, reputation, or even the chef, support staff, or management. I've come to realize, that after all is said and done, all of the above play an important role. As individuals, but especially more so, as customers, we tend to gravitate to the comfortable, to the better quality, to the individual needs and tastes we enjoy.  By that I mean, we can choose to frequent certain establishments or choose to play ""Dining Lottery"", at every occasion we eat out - especially in the Bay Area. We have no end of choices in the variety and selection of food in which we may partake. That being said, I would like to highly recommend California Pizza Kitchen, located at Westfield Mall Valley Fair. (As it can become quite busy, I recommend that you give yourself a few extra minutes to be seated. The wait time shall be justified, as I have alluded to above). We arrived just before 6 pm and were added to the waitlist. As David, at the reception area, took our names, he asked us our preference of seating location. We could be seated at booths, high tables, the bar, and even outdoors. Wow! How many restaurants have that many choices yet even offer the customer a choice as to where to sit! (Believe me, I've been in many restaurants and I have never been offered the pleasure of choice). We like David, so will you. Josh our host was a pleasant surprise and a welcome pleasure. He was very friendly, had a great smile, a great personality, a calm demeanor, and most importantly, as busy as it was at the restaurant for he and all the staff, he made us feel welcome. To me, that is going,"" Above and Beyond"". At a lot of establishments, they tend to make you feel like they are pushing cattle. Here at California Pizza Kitchen, we felt as if they had known us and were treating us as V.I.P.'s ! (On a side note, Josh offered to take our drink orders to help the wait staff.  It was crazy busy that night. I decided to play a little joke on Josh, and asked him for iced coffee. Without batting an eylash or skipping a heartbeat, Josh said that they did not carry iced coffee in the menu, but, they did have coffee, and they did have ice. He offered to bring them out with a creamer and he asked if that would be acceptable.  Holy cow!   Josh was on top of it! And as a matter of fact, we did order the iced coffee). That's what I call exceptional service. Thank you Josh. Another high point in our dining experience was our waiter, James. Once again I'd like to point out that it was quite busy. James came to our table offered to refresh our drinks drinks and gave us the menus. He pointed out that fresh bread was in the oven and he would bring it out shortly. After a while, James came back and took our orders. He noticed immediately that our ice water needed refreshing. (Without having to be asked). I call that, being ""Prescient"".  Pior experience at other establishments has proven that customers usually have to raise the waiter's attention in order to refill the water glasses. James was also very attentive, I noticed, to all his customers in his area. After delivery of our food, James made sure to stop by and ask if we needed anything else. Considering the wait for our food, James presented us with ice cream, free of charge. Quite admirable, thank you James.  As stated with Josh and David, James was  exceptional with a nice personality... Made us feel very special indeed. The food of course, at California Pizza Kitchen, is always fresh, tasty, crisp, warm, hot , cold, salty, sweet.., where and when appropriate.  They have an extensive menu, all of which are yummy. I make it a point to try something different each time I return. Sadly, I haven't been able to make it out too frequently..,but that will change. I'd also like to compliment the chef, the cooks, the other wait staff, and all the support staff necessary to keep California Pizza Kitchen running smoothly. *On a side note.* I had the pleasure of meeting Peter, the general manager. I noticed him walking around throughout the evening, checking on staff and visiting tables, speaking with customers. I caught Peter's attention and ask him to our table. I spoke to him about everything that I've written above, shook his hand and explained to him that we were highly impressed with his restaurant and his ability to pick staff and show them how to accommodate customer's needs, the California Pizza Kitchen way.  Peter was quite pleasant to talk to. Thank you Peter! I wish Peter and everyone at California Pizza Kitchen good health, prosperity, and happiness.

Dakota Smashed Pea + Barley Soup YUM! My party of 4 weren't that hungry so we didn't want to order more pizzas. We ended up going for a healthy soup and it was delicious! I really liked it, even though it kinda tasted a little like grass, pea soup. The pieces of barley really give it a bit more texture and chew since the rest of the soup is mushy. It wasn't too salty and had good pea flavor to it. Such a good surprise. The Works Little did I know that ""The Works"" is really just a combination pizza. This just goes to show you have descriptions can sometimes be a little tricky. It was still really good though. The toppings were solid and pretty fresh. The bread had a good crisp to it.  Jamaican Jerk Chicken It's nothing like Back A Yard's jerk chicken but it's still good. The thin crust went well with the saucey, BBQ-esque flavors. I was surprised that they didn't use mediocre chicken on their pizzas, as many franchise pizza places do. The chicken was decent. Everything was just a little bit on the salty and oily side.

The place was clean, the staff was attentive, and we got very quick service. The thai salad is delicious although there is not much lettuce (weird because that is what I was expecting). It was also perfect for my friend and I to share! The thin crust margherita was amazing, although I wish it had a bit more basil.  I do wish they had more thin crust options but I guess that is a set thing?

But for whatever reason my friend really wanted to go here tonight, so we ducked in while we waited for his iPhone to be repaired. I think he's just an Apple addict who wanted to be close-by in case something went wrong, so he could burn the case in effigy or something. He's kinda that guy. So in we went. I got a salad since I didn't want to do pizza at 7:45pm. A moment on the lips, a lifetime on the hips, and all that. He ordered a salmon dish from the ""light"" menu. We also had a special menu item, guacamole and chips, while we waited. The guacamole was bland. No other way to say it. Also, the portion was small enough that even though there were only about 15 chips on the plate, they outlasted the guacamole. I don't think this was a kitchen issue, it looked just like the picture on the menu. I just think that it's poorly conceptualized as an appetizer. The salad was just so-so. For the same price, the Cheesecake Factory, just down the hallway, is three times better and 50% bigger. My friend's salmon was just a bit dry and overcooked, and the portion was a little on the small side.  Disappointing to say the least; although again, pretty consistent with my experience of anything that's not pizza at CPK. The hosts and servers couldn't have been any nicer, which is why it's two and not one star, and I half-think that the kitchen did the best they could with uninspiring recipes and mediocre quality ingredients.

173,Roberto Carlos ..,"San Francisco, CA",1,28,45.0,5.0,2014-08-02,"I used to wonder why a restaurant was always so busy. Was it due to the quality and selection of the food, the location, decore, lighting, ambiance, reputation, or even the chef, support staff, or management. I've come to realize, that after all is said and done, all of the above play an important role. As individuals, but especially more so, as customers, we tend to gravitate to the comfortable, to the better quality, to the individual needs and tastes we enjoy.  By that I mean, we can choose to frequent certain establishments or choose to play ""Dining Lottery"", at every occasion we eat out - especially in the Bay Area. We have no end of choices in the variety and selection of food in which we may partake. That being said, I would like to highly recommend California Pizza Kitchen, located at Westfield Mall Valley Fair. (As it can become quite busy, I recommend that you give yourself a few extra minutes to be seated. The wait time shall be justified, as I have alluded to above). We arrived just before 6 pm and were added to the waitlist. As David, at the reception area, took our names, he asked us our preference of seating location. We could be seated at booths, high tables, the bar, and even outdoors. Wow! How many restaurants have that many choices yet even offer the customer a choice as to where to sit! (Believe me, I've been in many restaurants and I have never been offered the pleasure of choice). We like David, so will you. Josh our host was a pleasant surprise and a welcome pleasure. He was very friendly, had a great smile, a great personality, a calm demeanor, and most importantly, as busy as it was at the restaurant for he and all the staff, he made us feel welcome. To me, that is going,"" Above and Beyond"". At a lot of establishments, they tend to make you feel like they are pushing cattle. Here at California Pizza Kitchen, we felt as if they had known us and were treating us as V.I.P.'s ! (On a side note, Josh offered to take our drink orders to help the wait staff.  It was crazy busy that night. I decided to play a little joke on Josh, and asked him for iced coffee. Without batting an eylash or skipping a heartbeat, Josh said that they did not carry iced coffee in the menu, but, they did have coffee, and they did have ice. He offered to bring them out with a creamer and he asked if that would be acceptable.  Holy cow!   Josh was on top of it! And as a matter of fact, we did order the iced coffee). That's what I call exceptional service. Thank you Josh. Another high point in our dining experience was our waiter, James. Once again I'd like to point out that it was quite busy. James came to our table offered to refresh our drinks drinks and gave us the menus. He pointed out that fresh bread was in the oven and he would bring it out shortly. After a while, James came back and took our orders. He noticed immediately that our ice water needed refreshing. (Without having to be asked). I call that, being ""Prescient"".  Pior experience at other establishments has proven that customers usually have to raise the waiter's attention in order to refill the water glasses. James was also very attentive, I noticed, to all his customers in his area. After delivery of our food, James made sure to stop by and ask if we needed anything else. Considering the wait for our food, James presented us with ice cream, free of charge. Quite admirable, thank you James.  As stated with Josh and David, James was  exceptional with a nice personality... Made us feel very special indeed. The food of course, at California Pizza Kitchen, is always fresh, tasty, crisp, warm, hot , cold, salty, sweet.., where and when appropriate.  They have an extensive menu, all of which are yummy. I make it a point to try something different each time I return. Sadly, I haven't been able to make it out too frequently..,but that will change. I'd also like to compliment the chef, the cooks, the other wait staff, and all the support staff necessary to keep California Pizza Kitchen running smoothly. *On a side note.* I had the pleasure of meeting Peter, the general manager. I noticed him walking around throughout the evening, checking on staff and visiting tables, speaking with customers. I caught Peter's attention and ask him to our table. I spoke to him about everything that I've written above, shook his hand and explained to him that we were highly impressed with his restaurant and his ability to pick staff and show them how to accommodate customer's needs, the California Pizza Kitchen way.  Peter was quite pleasant to talk to. Thank you Peter! I wish Peter and everyone at California Pizza Kitchen good health, prosperity, and happiness.

I'm not a huge fan of franchise restaurants, mainly because they all seem to have such generalized food that never really impresses, but CPK is a refreshing reanimation. This location is nice and spacious, not small and crowded like the ones in Hawaii, and the servers are extremely attentive. Speaking of, Nick, my server for a couple my visits, was GREAT!!! Since I was all alone, it was great that he didn't bug me too much but just made sure I had what I needed.  The food is pretty fantastic too. I had their BBQ Chicken Salad which was super tasty. the Sage and Truffle pizza was -Ah-MaZing and it's a good thing they keep that rich tasting pizza small, the corn/tortilla soup is okay but not amazing, the Lobster-mayo pizza is only good if you're a super fan of lobster and mayonnaise, and the Salted Caramel pudding is pretty yummy!! What I'm really saying is this: everything is spot-on delicious! I always tell myself to be more adventurous when I go to an old favorite spot, but sometimes that sentiment is hard to keep when going off-book ends in disappointment. Good thing CPK hasn't disappointed me yet!! I've been to several California Pizza Kitchens but none have impressed me like this location.

That's how they get you! Dakota Smashed Pea + Barley Soup YUM! My party of 4 weren't that hungry so we didn't want to order more pizzas. We ended up going for a healthy soup and it was delicious! I really liked it, even though it kinda tasted a little like grass, pea soup. The pieces of barley really give it a bit more texture and chew since the rest of the soup is mushy. It wasn't too salty and had good pea flavor to it. Such a good surprise. The Works Little did I know that ""The Works"" is really just a combination pizza. This just goes to show you have descriptions can sometimes be a little tricky. It was still really good though. The toppings were solid and pretty fresh. The bread had a good crisp to it.  Jamaican Jerk Chicken It's nothing like Back A Yard's jerk chicken but it's still good. The thin crust went well with the saucey, BBQ-esque flavors. I was surprised that they didn't use mediocre chicken on their pizzas, as many franchise pizza places do. The chicken was decent. Everything was just a little bit on the salty and oily side. But hey it's pizza, so it's understandable. Service was pretty good, no complaints though it does get really crowded so try to put your name down early.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=200,2.96,3.31,3.164,3.12,3.17

Katie came back and took our drink orders since the kiddie pizza was cooking now.  I asked her to please help me out by recommending her favorite item(s) so I did not hold her up, she looked pretty busy.  She quickly described her favorites, and told me about her favorite 'new' item as well.  She hurried off and ordered our drinks so we could make some decisions.   She arrived back with our drinks and at the same time a young guy delivered the tiny pizza to our minor companion so he could solve the hunger issue he was dealing with, thank G-d, as his i-pad was out of juice, he was hungry, the adult conversation was boring him to death, etc., etc., etc... We made our decisions: Tuscan White Bean Hummus Petite Wedge Salad Shrimp Scampi Zucchini Cedar Plank Salmon Red Velvet Cake  Our hummus was superb and it was served with warm pita bread triangles.  The wedge salad was great, so we shared that after the hummus.  The shrimp was amazing.  It was served with thinly sliced zucchini over top of pasta in a delicious sauce.  I was jealous, as this was Ilana's food--but I kept eating it.  But, my Salmon was 'off the hook' as well.  Salmon served on a cedar plank, along side of a white corn succotash covered with feta...wooooooow, again!   While we were eating the service manager, Deanna, came to the table and invited Ilana's son on a tour of the kitchen to watch the cooks make pizza...wooooooow, again!  How cool for kids to be able to get a little tour and special treatment at such a busy location.   After he returned, the Red Velvet Cake came too!  I never eat sweets too much (I am sweet enough already), but this looked like something my grammy would have made, so just one bite--it was crazy good! Now, I realize CPK is not meant to be fine dining, of course; however, the treatment we received at this particular location was above standard--anywhere!  Tony runs a really tight ship.  You can tell from Katie's professional service, Deanna's awesome guest relations with tiny diners, and the remarkable teamwork we witnessed throughout the restaurant.  We will be back for sure to be ""wowed"" again.

And also saw it on other tables when we were seated but they did not serve us that. Anyhow we had few appetizers in mind so didn't miss it much, but pointing out inconsistency. There was no silverware provided on our table.  We placed our order of soup, appetizers and main course. She got us appetizers and some main course. So we inquired if she was getting the soup, lest she forgot about it. She replies I got what my two hands could carry :( Is that how you reply to customers in hospitality industry? All she had to say is, its coming up.  Quesadillas were burnt. Nuts had gone rancid in Pear and gorgonzola pizza, so we informed the server. She came back with a comment from chef - ""that's how hazelnut turn out once baked"". Really?

Katie came back and took our drink orders since the kiddie pizza was cooking now.  I asked her to please help me out by recommending her favorite item(s) so I did not hold her up, she looked pretty busy.  She quickly described her favorites, and told me about her favorite 'new' item as well.  She hurried off and ordered our drinks so we could make some decisions.   She arrived back with our drinks and at the same time a young guy delivered the tiny pizza to our minor companion so he could solve the hunger issue he was dealing with, thank G-d, as his i-pad was out of juice, he was hungry, the adult conversation was boring him to death, etc., etc., etc... We made our decisions: Tuscan White Bean Hummus Petite Wedge Salad Shrimp Scampi Zucchini Cedar Plank Salmon Red Velvet Cake  Our hummus was superb and it was served with warm pita bread triangles.  The wedge salad was great, so we shared that after the hummus.  The shrimp was amazing.  It was served with thinly sliced zucchini over top of pasta in a delicious sauce.  I was jealous, as this was Ilana's food--but I kept eating it.  But, my Salmon was 'off the hook' as well.  Salmon served on a cedar plank, along side of a white corn succotash covered with feta...wooooooow, again!   While we were eating the service manager, Deanna, came to the table and invited Ilana's son on a tour of the kitchen to watch the cooks make pizza...wooooooow, again!  How cool for kids to be able to get a little tour and special treatment at such a busy location.   After he returned, the Red Velvet Cake came too!  I never eat sweets too much (I am sweet enough already), but this looked like something my grammy would have made, so just one bite--it was crazy good! Now, I realize CPK is not meant to be fine dining, of course; however, the treatment we received at this particular location was above standard--anywhere!  Tony runs a really tight ship.  You can tell from Katie's professional service, Deanna's awesome guest relations with tiny diners, and the remarkable teamwork we witnessed throughout the restaurant.  We will be back for sure to be ""wowed"" again.

After explaining our situation, the hostesses (Crystal and Carly) at CPK were eager to help us out with no hesitation. We were seated within 5 minutes. They brought us warm bread and olive oil dip right away. Our waiter, Joneil, was amazing. He greeted us promptly and was totally happy to be serving us which is really great because most waiters are usually not excited to serve big parties. He always made sure our glasses were full and brought our food out in a reasonable amount of time. I got the shredded mushroom and spinach flat bread (exceptional) and had a couple bites of my friends meals and everything tasted pretty good. My friend wanted something off the old menu that they no longer served but he had the guys in the kitchen make it for her anyway (amazing!!!!). We had a couple more people join us later on in the night and he had no problem taking their orders. He even treated us to dessert!! It made our night and we couldn't be more grateful. He was even cool with splitting the tab which is usually our biggest challenge when we go out. At the end of the night he was kind enough to walk us to the door. I wish this was the experience I had every time I go out!!  Bottom line is you can't go wrong at this place. We will definitely be coming again and want to thank the staff for being so accommodating!!!!",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=180,3.96,3.51,3.348,3.668,3.69

The chopped chicken salad was fresh and tasty. At about $15 a plate, it is a little pricey, but the food here is generally a little bit expensive for the quality. I always get the Jamaican jerk chicken pizza. It's got an interesting taste to it that you can't get anywhere else. Seems like it's got some sweet and sour sauce on it with pepper and maybe cinnamon? Lots of interesting flavors. My boyfriend wasn't a fan of it, but I thought it was delicious because it tasted so different from a normal pizza.  Service was great, fast and friendly.

Started off with the avocado eggrolls and then got the chopped chicken salad (whole) and the Jamaican jerk chicken pizza to share. The avocado eggrolls were good, but not even close to the quality and deliciousness of the ones at Cheesecake Factory. They've got cheese and chicken in them and a crispy  thin shell. The chopped chicken salad was fresh and tasty. At about $15 a plate, it is a little pricey, but the food here is generally a little bit expensive for the quality. I always get the Jamaican jerk chicken pizza. It's got an interesting taste to it that you can't get anywhere else. Seems like it's got some sweet and sour sauce on it with pepper and maybe cinnamon? Lots of interesting flavors. My boyfriend wasn't a fan of it, but I thought it was delicious because it tasted so different from a normal pizza.  Service was great, fast and friendly.

811,Brendan D.,"Cupertino, United States",369,222,92.0,4.0,2015-11-30,"Just this past Saturday, I was at the mall with my family shopping of course since it was Black Friday weekend, and we decided that it'd be nice to give CPK a shot, since it's been there pretty much forever.  We entered around 5:30pm or so, we asked for a booth and were seated immediately.  After perusing through the menu, I decided on one of their seasonal specials, the sunny side up pizza, my dad went for the thin-crust sicilian pizza, my sister went for the thin-crust chicken pesto and artichoke pizza(not actually sure if this is the name, but that's what was on the pizza ^^), and my mom went for their salmon entree.  We also decided to try some appetizers, so we went for the white corn guacamole with chips and an order of 3 spring rolls thai-style. After taking our orders, our waitress asked if we wanted bread, and of course we did, and in like a minute she quickly returned with a a plate of bread and a plate for each of us to eat off of.  As a dip, we were served a small dish of olive oil that had an abundance of herbs and a few red pepper flakes.  I've actually never been to a restaurant that served herb olive oil with bread before, but it was extremely flavorful, and the red pepper flakes added just a nice hint of spiciness. Our appetizers arrived around 15 minutes or so after we ordered.  I was a bit saddened initially by the amount of guacamole we were served, and it's  maybe a few ounces in weight, but luckily the flavor made up for it.  The white corn was nice, fresh, and crisp, and it added a really nice sweetness to the guacamole.  The chips themselves were perfectly salted and complimented the guacamole well.  The spring rolls we ordered were wrapped in pieces of tortilla and pan-fried.  Each roll was served with it's own dish of peanut sauce, very similar to the peanut sauce you'd get with a Vietnamese spring roll, but more on the peanuty side.  They were a bit on the small side, but after biting them, again I was quite impressed with the flavor and crunch.  The wait for our actual dinners took a bit longer than expected, but our waitress continually checked in on us and apologized for the wait as well as making sure to refill our waters consistently, and offering up more bread each time she came, but after the 2nd order of bread, we had to call it quits to save room for the main meal.  Eventually our meals all came out together nice and hot.  The salmon my mom ordered was cooked on a piece of cedar wood it seems and in an oven.  It was cooked perfectly with a nice char on the outside, yet still soft and moist on the inside.  It was garnished with a sort of corn salsa that has a spicy kick to it, and it complimented the salmon very well.  My sunny side up pizza was a pizza with green onions, bacon, thinly-sliced and crisp fingerling potatoes, and two sunny-side up eggs.  Yummmm, even though it sounds like it should be brunch haha.  My actual pizza was a bit smaller in size than the pizzas my dad and sister received, and I guess the crust is their normal crust, which was cooked well and soft like bread when I bit in.  My whole family in general really enjoys a crisp crust when it comes to pizza, which is why my dad and sister went for thin-crust options.  Although the pizza looked quite crispy, when actually biting into it, they both noted that their respective pizza were sort of on the soft side, and probably because of too much oil on top.  A slight bummer, but the flavors were really good.  My dad's sicilian pizza was topped with spicy salami, sausage, pepperoni, and sliced basil.  It had really good flavor despite the lack of crunch.  My sister's pizza also had good flavor, but it was a bit on the heavy side because of all the pesto. We all didn't finish our respective meals because there was a lot of food, but we made sure to save room for dessert.  We asked our waitress for the dessert menu, and when she handed it to us, she highly recommended the salted caramel pudding with cookie bits.  I went for that, but my sister opted for the chocolate souffle cake with a scoop of ice cream.  The desserts came out fast, and we dug in.  My pudding was amazingly exquisitely.  The sweet caramel was balanced well by the salt, and then the soft texture of the pudding and whip cream on top was balanced by cripsy cookie bits at the bottom of the jar.  I really enjoyed this dessert and would recommend it to everyone!  My sister's souffle cake was decent, but we've had better before, and it's sort of a staple at a lot of restaurants, so it wasn't anything out of the extraordinary. Overall, we really enjoyed our meal here.  The price point is a bit high, but I mean it's Valley Fair, so it's understandable.  For both appetizers, I wish the portions could have been a bit bigger, but the entree and pizzas were all a good size for the price.  Good meal, and absolutely fantastic service.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara?start=100,3.32,3.61,3.448,2.768,3.494

She didn't even say sorry and just let us keep waiting!  Finally we were led to a table by a girl who was much better and at least apologized to us for those two rude girls in the front desk.

Lots of families with strollers parked around the waiting area. I've never seen this place so busy, and with lots of kids. My friend and I sat at one of those high tables in the rear meant for four so we had plenty of room. It was a lot quieter since the kids that could sit on those chairs had to be old enough not to fall. Sarah was prompt to ask for drink orders and brought them out with the bread I asked for (upon request). It comes with olive oil dipping sauce and the bread was toasty warm.  She proceeded to take our entree orders: wild mushroom pizza and half Thai crunch salad. Both were delicious and a portion of the pizza had a lot of cheese and herbs on it-- so good and fragrant with every bite! I finished my half salad and was surprised I didn't have to ask for less dressing. Last time I ate at a CPK it was almost drenched, not at this location though. Salad presentation was great! I dug in without taking any photos, sorry! The greens, edamame, cucumber slivers, and peanuts were evenly coated in sweet peanut dressing, generously topped with thin rice sticks that were drizzled beautifully with more dressing. For $11.50 it was very filling. The $15 full size would've been too much.  While service was always polite and friendly, our waitress wasn't around much aside from taking our orders and asking how we were doing. I think her other tables were far from ours. We asked a different waitress for napkins and she obliged. Payment was quick and the leftover pizza boxed up. Our water wasn't refilled so I assume they're still conserving water.  Turns out the Take Out area was on that end of the bar behind us. It's not the best location for that. Stanford shopping center has a designated take out area right behind the hostess stand, which is a lot more convenient than walking all the way to the back of the restaurant. I ordered a take out CA club pizza from this area and it was so busy no one came around for five minutes. With a 15 min quote, I told the manager(?) who rang me up we'd come back after shopping. Well, I came back half an hour later and this lovely lady named Sheena with stylish crimped platinum blonde hair and black roots tied up with a bandana headband already knew the CA club was for me (was she psychic?). She assured me twice the staff was preparing the salad topping fresh. I didn't mind the wait as my friend and I took our seats at the bar.

I called CPK directly and got the manager who said that she couldn't understand why the pasta was undercooked because it's cooked once during beginning of shift and then again when it's ordered. She did offer to send me a gift card for my bad experience. Once I got the gift card in the mail I ordered the same chicken tequila pasta twice. Both times I went into the restaurant to pick it up. Both times it was great just like I remembered. And both times they included bread in the bag like I had asked. Last night I ordered from Door Dash again. Mostly because the new parking situation at CPK valley fair is terrible. There is no longer spots for picking up your ToGO food. What do you know? Pasta came undercooked AGAIN and no bread and olive oil like I specifically asked. Not to mention the Door Dasher came 45 minutes late. (Which is a separate compliant I have made with DD).

But we were sitting inside on the waiting bench, right in front of their desk, why didn't she ask inside? If I didn't check, we would be waiting there without knowing we've been skipped! She didn't even say sorry and just let us keep waiting!  Finally we were led to a table by a girl who was much better and at least apologized to us for those two rude girls in the front desk. Then came the waiter, cold, and didn't care about us at all. He served three dirty plates like being left on another table, with oil on it. We requested to change. Then he brought another three, still not clean. He said, ""Oh we can not polish the plates"". Third time, I took the picture attached with this review. What can I say? We will not be here anymore.

They were crowded, but the wait time for a table was only about 15 min. or so.  We were seated by a server with a good smile.  In the past, I'd normally share a pizza and appetizer with someone, and get maybe like a half of a BBQ Chicken Salad, and the food has always been fairly good. Pizzas are normally California style with a hand-tossed thin crust topped with a variety of non-traditional ingredients and sauces. One of the proverbial favorites is the BBQ Chicken Pizza, which has a reall good flavor profile. Some are gluten-free, I think. I thought I'd venture out of my comfort zone and order something other than salad. As I was looking at the menu, though, maybe a 1/3 of it is (naturally) pizza, and the rest of the menu are appetizers, soups/salads, drinks, a handful of specialty entrees, and a handful of pastas.  I went with the Jambalaya Fettucini - spicy, w/blackened shrimp, crawfish, chicken, andouille sausage, and ham ($16.99). My Dad ordered the Kung Pao Spaghetti, which he said was good. Wait time was a good 15 min, or so.  On mine, though the flavor profile was pretty good, and piping hot, the pasta was still raw. Now, I like al dente, but the texture on the pasta was still hard! I sent it back, and had to wait another 15 minutes. The server reassured me that they would cook the pasta a little bit longer. The next one came out even more piping hot, and though it didn't have the crunchy texture this time, the pasta was still firm, and pretty borderline al dente on the firmer side, but better than the first. There is actually a really good amount of all the ingredients. My only comment about the dish though, is that it's a bit too complex with a shitload of ingredients, and prob could do without the chicken and the ham.  Been coming here off and on over the 15 years they've been here, and have always been a fairly decent standby. They are most definitely family friendly, casual, and have a good formula going.

Lots of families with strollers parked around the waiting area. I've never seen this place so busy, and with lots of kids. My friend and I sat at one of those high tables in the rear meant for four so we had plenty of room. It was a lot quieter since the kids that could sit on those chairs had to be old enough not to fall. Sarah was prompt to ask for drink orders and brought them out with the bread I asked for (upon request). It comes with olive oil dipping sauce and the bread was toasty warm.  She proceeded to take our entree orders: wild mushroom pizza and half Thai crunch salad. Both were delicious and a portion of the pizza had a lot of cheese and herbs on it-- so good and fragrant with every bite! I finished my half salad and was surprised I didn't have to ask for less dressing. Last time I ate at a CPK it was almost drenched, not at this location though. Salad presentation was great! I dug in without taking any photos, sorry! The greens, edamame, cucumber slivers, and peanuts were evenly coated in sweet peanut dressing, generously topped with thin rice sticks that were drizzled beautifully with more dressing. For $11.50 it was very filling. The $15 full size would've been too much.  While service was always polite and friendly, our waitress wasn't around much aside from taking our orders and asking how we were doing. I think her other tables were far from ours. We asked a different waitress for napkins and she obliged. Payment was quick and the leftover pizza boxed up. Our water wasn't refilled so I assume they're still conserving water.  Turns out the Take Out area was on that end of the bar behind us. It's not the best location for that. Stanford shopping center has a designated take out area right behind the hostess stand, which is a lot more convenient than walking all the way to the back of the restaurant. I ordered a take out CA club pizza from this area and it was so busy no one came around for five minutes. With a 15 min quote, I told the manager(?) who rang me up we'd come back after shopping. Well, I came back half an hour later and this lovely lady named Sheena with stylish crimped platinum blonde hair and black roots tied up with a bandana headband already knew the CA club was for me (was she psychic?). She assured me twice the staff was preparing the salad topping fresh. I didn't mind the wait as my friend and I took our seats at the bar.

After 15 minutes of waiting for 2 table spoon of sauce I told the girl that wasn't enough and needed more...so here we go again waiting for more damn sauce and after 10 minutes she comes back with more sauce and says per her manager she needs to charge me for all this extra sauce.

However, I've experienced sub standard service in ToGo every single time. Our recent worst experience is on the eve of superbowl LI (2017) , I ordered 4 pizza and 1 pasta. Pretty standard and simple. However, when i reached to pick up they closed the restaurant 1 hr early due to emergency (superbowl) which i was not made aware of. I had to call and ask them to open the door. When i got the order after paying, none of the pizza had dressings. Just Plain dough .i mean like if i just want to eat baked dough , can eat at home. Their reason: they are out of dressings and seasonings. I don't understand if you claim the order complete and have guts to ask for money, you should make sure pizza is complete. Chipolte pizza and tostada pizza is just dough without the dressing and nobody wants to pay 15 bucks for that. After some explanation, they get some dressing but of different pizza to keep us going. Ohh and they were out of bags due to 'emergency'.

I won't even talk about how the kids being juveniles, how the acted or how they dressed and that baby that smelled like $#\!!! We had to move!! I made a run for it...TO THE BAR!!!! We didn't have any kids in tow..They were at school!! Johnny at the Bar was GREAT!!! Ordered up some appetizers... Sesame Ginger Chicken Dumpling...OUTSTANDING! I could of ate 2 orders to myself!! The White Corn Guacamole +Chips..Disappointing.. Needed 2 hand to scoop! I ordered, BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad w/Avocado It was ok. Hardly any meat. For $3 dollars extra for Avocado, I hardly noticed that it was there.  The salad was bland, with a mayo after taste. I used a lot of Chalupa hot sauce to give it flavor.  The Wife ordered a Lunch Duo. Pepperoni pizza- personal 4 slices and salad, Super Spinach+ Quinoa. She enjoyed it! I did grab a slice of her pizza...It was very good!! I have had their pizza before via Doordash and I've turned into a fan!!!   If you've read or seen any of my YELP, you should know that I love PIZZA!! We had great service! Our food came out hot and in a timely fashion!! Oh that family... Security had to come and escort them out!! It was entertaining!!

Unfortunately, the construction sort of hindered my experience.  My girlfriend and I arrived and we were sat immediately. The host was super friendly and so was our server, Taylor. We started with the artichoke dip and a couple beverages: a mai tai and and Moscow Mule. The Mules here are pretty good, but maybe not the best choice with the artichoke dip. The dip was great, though. It was cheesy and it had nice, soft chunks of artichoke. It would have gone great with an 805.  For our entrees, we ordered the Lemongrass Chicken and the Shrimp Scampi with Zucchini. The chicken was perfect.

Unfortunately, the construction sort of hindered my experience.  My girlfriend and I arrived and we were sat immediately. The host was super friendly and so was our server, Taylor. We started with the artichoke dip and a couple beverages: a mai tai and and Moscow Mule. The Mules here are pretty good, but maybe not the best choice with the artichoke dip. The dip was great, though. It was cheesy and it had nice, soft chunks of artichoke. It would have gone great with an 805.  For our entrees, we ordered the Lemongrass Chicken and the Shrimp Scampi with Zucchini. The chicken was perfect.

However, when i reached to pick up they closed the restaurant 1 hr early due to emergency (superbowl) which i was not made aware of. I had to call and ask them to open the door. When i got the order after paying, none of the pizza had dressings. Just Plain dough .i mean like if i just want to eat baked dough , can eat at home. Their reason: they are out of dressings and seasonings. I don't understand if you claim the order complete and have guts to ask for money, you should make sure pizza is complete. Chipolte pizza and tostada pizza is just dough without the dressing and nobody wants to pay 15 bucks for that. After some explanation, they get some dressing but of different pizza to keep us going.

This was the best experience I have ever had at a CPK and I will be back for sure.,https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-clara,3.52,2.8,3.048,,3.088
