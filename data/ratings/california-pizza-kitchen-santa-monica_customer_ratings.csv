Big problem especially since the missing dressing was for the boss.  I called to inform them of the problem and they told me they were going to send a guy out to deliver them. Half hour later we finally got the dressings, but by that time, we were practically done with our lunches. I could have walked down to the restaurant and come back to the office faster than that.

105,Sean L.,"Palms, Los Angeles, CA",1113,175,,4.0,2013-01-02,"Happy new year! We came here on NYE around 7:30 to get a good base in our stomach before the all night binge drinking marathon.  Great decision.  4 guys. We were headed to The Penthouse at the Huntley shortly after around 9:15. It's right across the street, so it worked out perfectly. We were greeted promptly by a cute girl who sat us immediately. We sat in a booth. Very comfortable and relaxed environment. There were actually quite a few families there.  I can't remember our waiters name, but he kicked major butt. He was from Boston and had a very thick accent. Good lookin' redheaded guy.  He playfully bantered with us for awhile and was great at checking on us.  At one point, I even spilled my beer everywhere. I ordered a Samuel Adams Winter Lager on tap. I was telling a story about the time my friends neighbor got cock-blocked by Brian Urlacher and the next thing I know, my beer is all over the floor and table. I wasn't even drunk....haha.  Our waiter was on point. He came right over and got me a brand new beer. He also made a smart ass remark that killed at the table.  We ordered a BBQ Hawaiian pizza and a meat lovers pizza. The pizzas were good, but the portions were very weak. There were four of us. Two pizzas should have been enough. Also, they bring bread to the table, and we only got four pieces of bread. I was still hungry after the meal.  If the portions were bigger, this place would get 5 stars in my book.  Great service is really hard to come by, especially in SaMo, but this place was above and beyond.  PROS: Great service -Relaxed atmosphere and vibe -Quick -Delicious -BREAD! CONS: Terribly small portions I think I'll go back here by myself and eat a pizza by myself.  Enjoy the food and drinks - ask for the dude from Harvard Bar!

102,Sukhraj B.,"Orange, CA",1725,1189,1870.0,4.0,2013-02-25,"After eating a big meal of Thai food and getting some ice cream, I didn't think I'd be hungry however we spent a good 3 or 4 hours browsing the Barnes and Noble nearby after a while, I was feeling hunger pangs again. We got here about an hour and half before closing. The promenade was mostly empty by this late hour which means so was the restaurant. We were seated quickly in a booth and service is prompt and attentive.  Since it was late at night, I was freezing. I ordered a bowl of their tortilla soup and it hit the spot. Warmed me up and I was ready for the appetizer and the main meal. After quickly browsing, we both decided on the guacamole. It arrived a bit bland and we seasoned it with some table salt. Not bad after that but the portion is tiny. I don't think I'd order this again. I'm a big fan of guacamole and you have to give me more guac than that or give me equal shares of both or none at all. For my main meal, I went with the BLT pizza. It wasn't bad but I probably won't order it again. The chilled lettuce on top cools the whole pizza down which then gives it a weird taste. I like my pizza hot. This is probably a bad idea for a pizza. I do however enjoy their other pizza offerings.  Overall, it wasn't a bad meal. I enjoyed my pizza the next day as leftovers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-monica?start=100,3.48,3.48,3.48,3.088,3.4800000000000004

Our waiter was a nice enough fellow, but for some reason his jokes left me pretty irritated with his service. Maybe I was just in a mood as I'd been up earlier than usual today. Anyway, I ordered the fire roasted chile relleno, which was delicious with its blend of chicken, cheese, beans, avocado salsa, and other delights, but small in proportion to the $11 cost in my opinion.

174,Lia K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,11,,1.0,2013-06-28,"Do you enjoy decent service and moderately attentive/intelligent waiters who don't leave you sitting at your table for up to 40+ minutes without so much as a status update regarding your food? Does it irk you when you watch patrons seated a good 20 minutes after you beginning to eat their meals while you sit, staring at your table  and wishing you'd gone anywhere else? Do you take offense when you ask for something simple, such as the check, and your waiter decides that he has better things to do? If so, avoid the CPK on Wilshire. If you decide to give it a try anyway and you're feeling extra masochistic/want to enjoy your meal with a side of all-consuming rage, ask for Leonardo, the worst server in the history of chain restaurant dining. My coworkers and I are partially to blame, I suppose. We've gone to this location more than a few times for our Friday group outings and we've always known the service has only barely toed the line of being passable. Perhaps we grew TOO comfortable with the location, however, as the service last time should've been a tip (something the waiters at this location rarely deserve) to never come back. 90 minutes to churn out salads and a pizza? In fairness, everyone has a bad day and since we'd become something like ""regulars"" at this CPK, we returned, promising to give it another chance. Never again. Leonardo, Leonardo, Leonardo... How can I begin to describe your rude, off-putting demeanor, ineptitude, and generally horrendous service? As a timeline, we arrived on 06/28/13 at 12:05 to a nearly empty restaurant and waited about 10 minutes as he ran around looking like a chicken with his head chopped off. After taking our orders, we waited. And waited. And waited. Around 12:40, we finally managed to flag him down and he said that the restaurant had been flooded with to-go orders and to be patient. Well, that might be a decent excuse if the patrons who'd been seated 15 minutes after us hadn't already begun eating. We asked him to bring our checks with our meals (if they ever came) because we had to get back to the office. We even left the credit cards out for him so it could be a quick exchange. Yet, when our food came, there were no checks. In fact, we had to BEG for him to bring us our bills and that prompted a very rude, ""HOLD ON, I'M GETTING TO IT!"", complete with a dismissive wave of the hand. Keep in mind, we asked for the checks around 12:40 and it was now 1PM. When he finally decided he couldn't find anymore excuses to ignore us, he took our cards and disappeared again, casually walking around and taking NEW orders rather than going to the cash register, which it turned out was also too much for him to handle. Since I'm being thorough, I guess I should also mention that when he brought us CPK's ongoing promotional ""Thank You Cards"", he threw them at us so disdainfully that they landed in a graceless pile on a plate, nearly splashing one of us with a bright pink sauce. I'm not entirely certain, but I believe that when your service is already as poor as Leonardo's, you should at least make an effort to preserve the few pennies that you've earned of your tip. I finally couldn't take it anymore and had to complain to the manager, who was, in my mind, the one redeeming part of this lunch venture (and the only reason this place deserves the 1 star that I'm giving it). If the rest of the staff at this restaurant had 1/1000000 of the professionalism as the nice Polish manager, whose name I don't know, I might come back. As it is, even with the free meal coupon, I will NOT be returning to this location because it isn't worth the horrible taste this branch leaves in my mouth. CPK on Wilshire, do yourself a favor before you lose all your regular patrons: fire Leonardo--heck, fire your entire current lunchtime wait staff, they're all equally bad--and hire people with a basic understanding of working in the food service industry.

91,Louis D.,"Los Angeles, CA",53,60,6.0,2.0,2013-11-29,I have gone hear before and had a great experience and normally they always give pretty good service. However this time was totally horrid except for the one waiter I dealt with.  I come inside the building and the hostess says hello then just looks at me. Then she asks would you like a seat I think well umm no shit ya think I came in here looking to eat would you like my money or not? Anywho she seats me then goes off and tells the waiter about his new table however instead of saying it to him personally she yells it across the entire business. It then turns out my waiter has maybe 3 tables in the entire building and the other guy has more than 10 tables to himself and the other waiters have a few aswell. I sat there for over 10 minutes never saw the waiter he never came over hostess never asked if I was being helped even though I was seated right behind them. Appareantly my waiter has time to be laughing kidding joking and yelling around the resturant about how a previous customer I saw seated along the wall walked off and didnt pay at all. Again not something that should be yelled across the entire resturant over and over and over again over another 10 minute period of me not being helped finally the other waiter who had more than ten tables came over and asked if I was being helped I said I think that guy is the waiter but I have never seen him nor heard from him in over 20 minutes now so no guess im not being helped. He said of well can I take your order than said but im not your waiter. At this point I just ordered my drink and food at the same time because who knows when someone would be back for my order. Now once I recieved my food the pizza looked good and smelled great like normal and until I picked up the slice the dough I dont think was cooked completely as the slice fell apart andd no matter how you held the thing just kept falling apart. I personally wish I would have just got up walked away and refused to pay for this food as it was disgusting. I wondered the entire time if there manager was on vacation and that was why they were acting like raging college kids at a party or something. Well just that one guy was behaving that way. I mean just kjepy running around talking laughing super loud yelling to other employees across the room just annoying while his other employees were working there buts off and he wasnt.

We then received the pizza. That too was not worth what they charge. 15$ for a pizza the size of a traditional round china plate and 14$ for the other equally small pizza. For half that price I can make from scratch a better fresh pizza because YES the pizza sent to us both had old ingredients you could clearly see had begun to rot. I spoke to the manager who apologized and said they had a new expediter and replaced the browning smooshy avocados with fresh green ones. Over all we spent 110$ and ate one third of what we order. We took food to go after picking off rotting vegetables but collectively agreed that the local homeless may appreciate the food as we had all lost out appetites.

Why a restaurant would continue serving alcohol to young kids, as full drinks were being knocked off the table onto the floor is beyond me.  This was totally irresponsible behavior on the part of Management and I would never go back to this place.  I know as a fact that we were not the only table that complained about these kids.

Okay I know who the hell orders a salad at a ""pizza joint"" lol but that was really sad salad plus I said no dressing but they still brought it on the side, what a way to save money I'm sure your managers are real proud! Also the lettuce you served was dead had no life in it, my fork couldn't even stab it properly had to use the scoop method on your lettuce! Lol That's just sad...so here's the main reason why I'm writing this, your salad menu states you can add grilled chicken breast, not chopped chicken breast or sliced chicken breast so when my food comes it's sliced/chopped whatever the hell you name it. Here's a heads up I'm a not a child and I'm not stupid, that one chicken breast and you guys charged me for two I thought I'd just write it up here and let everyone know what a half ass job your location is serving, I even asked the waitress if that's two breasts and she insists that it was one.

37,Clark L.,"El Segundo, CA",101,2,,1.0,2017-05-03,My friend was visiting from out of town. Service was slow getting us seated. As soon as we sat down it took 25 minutes to order drinks. We had to call for assistance and when the waitress came over she was not very welcoming. We ordered sodas. By the time they had came and we had drunk less than a quarter. The manager of the establishment came over and then proceeded to ask us to leave as we were disturbing the restaurant staff. I have been to many California Pizza kitchen establishments and am a huge fan. This is not like the rest. A sad experience for me. The manager was very disappointing and rude.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-monica?start=40,3.16,3.4,3.4,2.34,3.3040000000000007

However, if you are looking for delicious food that you will want more and more of, then you are coming to the right place. They have so many options on their menu and I've had almost all of them over the years. If you have never tried CPK, you really should give it chance because they have such a wide selection of delicious pizzas, salads, kinds of pasta, and sandwiches. I love this place because it is a quick in-and-out for lunch and the service is always great. They also have a rewards program so you can add up points from all your purchases and save money over time.

5,Tiffany C.,"Los Angeles, CA",2001,829,6051.0,4.0,2017-05-31,"Haven't had CPK in awhile - came to Santa Monica on a cold Saturday evening for my birthday, wanting to celebrate by the pier. But unfortunately it was raining incredibly hard by the time we made it out to Santa Monica. Ended up ducking into CPK for dinner and to wait out the rain.  This CPK is a bit fancier than the ones I've been to. Seems like the floorplan is executed well - with a round, bar-like area in the middle with low lights hanging over the seats. Very comfy indeed. Right when you walk in, you're greeted at the front of the house by several workers. Because we came during a huge storm, there weren't too many customers and the workers seemed to be much more relaxed and eager for the holidays. We were told to sit anywhere we wanted. Very friendly service, and our server was super chill and helpful throughout the night.  Ended up ordering the classic CPK dishes that I usually enjoy eating.  Fettucine Alfredo with chicken: Even though the portion size isn't too big, the creaminess of the alfredo sauce really packs a punch, getting you full pretty quickly. With the added parmesan cheese and chicken pieces, this dish was a hit. I've always been a fan of this dish at all CPK's, and this one didn't disappoint.  BBQ Chicken pizza: a classic pizza although this time it didn't taste as good as I remembered it to taste. A bit dry and not as tasty (maybe the sauce was lacking on the pizza?); but nonetheless, it hit the spot and satisfied our hunger cravings.  And our server was incredibly nice, throwing in a birthday dessert surprise for me, topped with a candle and whipped cream! I think it was some sort of brownie with chocolate syrup, whipped cream, and some candy - it definitely ended the night on a high note.  Don't forget to ask for complimentary bread and dip once you have ordered.  tl;dr - Solid food although I would probably expect a bit more from this CPK since it's located close to the pier. The service was pretty great, putting us both at ease despite the heavy rain outside.

I have been eating at CPK my whole life and have ordered this salad sooo many times. I know what the portions are like and this was definitely not it. I spoke to the manager and he said it is all measure and it is just all condensed together so i said okay. I got home and put it in the bowl from home and it was half as much as usual. Usually I split this with another person and get full but i was completely hungry after. I paid over $17 for this????? Not acceptable. If you're going to cut down on your portions then give your customers a lower price because now i am still hungry and disappointed in the service.

195,M G.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,15,,1.0,2017-11-01,"If you have any dietary restrictions, you had better check online yourself before going there and plan out what you will be ordering. Our waiter knew NOTHING. Not only that, but he wouldn't stay around long enough for us to ask all our questions so that we could place an order. Every question, he kept running off and saying he will be right back. He would disappear for minutes at a time. One in our party has a vegan diet. Another one has food allergies. We asked if eggs are used in any bread or pizza dough for the vegan. He said ALL of their dough and pasta contains eggs. How can that be? I asked him to ask the manager. I know eggs are not used in pizza dough and most pasta. He comes back to confirm that YES, ALL THE DOUGH AND PASTA CONTAINS EGGS. At this point, I'm totally confused. Our vegan settled on a salad and because of his lack of knowledge, I'm thinking I need to order a la cart so I can put together an allergy free meal for my kid. I asked him what vegetables they have for side dishes. Instead of answering me, he said, he'll be right back. He throws an incomplete dietary guide on the table for me to look through and takes off. I look at it. It only had calorie counts on the main dishes and not the ingredients or even side dishes. I had enough. It's been well over 15 minutes of back and forth with him and we didn't have any answers to our questions. We literally could not order anything or make any headway. We had no choice but to leave because we could not get serviced. We went to another restaurant a block away and their staff was knowledgeable and attentive. Everyone was able to eat. When I got home, I opened their complete dietary guide online. It states, All pizza dough can be used to make vegan pizza. It even gives examples how. All pasta can be used. It does show that the dough and pasta shares equipment, but it doesn't actually contain the eggs. Additionally any Gluten free dough is certified and vegan so it doesn't share any equipment. Why was this so difficult? It's not everyday we can get our family together to go out, so this really ruined our night. It could have been so simple if this waiter would have been better trained and stuck around to finish our order.  We have been going to this particular restaurant since it opened. It had a rough patch with service, but got it together after the remodel. Until this last time we came. Looks like they are heading back to their old ways. Train your staff better and hire people who want to help and be of service. More and more people have dietary restrictions for one reason or another. It can be food allergies, or health or lifestyle or newly developed intolerances in highly allergic people. Your menu states you can accommodate, but your staff doesn't know how to answer questions to help people work around the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-monica?start=20,2.68,3.19,3.19,,2.9859999999999998

0,H H.,"Santa Monica, CA",2,14,,4.0,2017-11-25,"I intended to go to Hillstone down the street but the wait was too long and all I had was 30 min. on my meter so I decided to head back to my car and go to another area that wasn't as packed.   I was parked right in front of California Pizza Kitchen, so I spontaneously opted to eat here instead.  The place was packed but there wasn't a wait so I was seated immediately.  But because it was packed, my food didn't come out for about 20 minutes.  I had only 6 minutes left on my meter so I asked an employee walking by if he knew whether the meter in front of his restaurant would allow me to just add more money or if it was one of those meters that won't allow you to recycle.   He didn't know the answer.  Now most people would have said I don't know and walk away.  Luis Pablo however inquired around and then inform me that I would need to move my car because it's one of those meters that won't allow you to refill.   Now if you're familiar with the 3rd Street Promenade area, you'll know that the minute you drive out of your parking space, there will be someone who will immediately pull in as this is a heavily visited area, especially on a Saturday of the Thanksgiving weekend.  To my pleasant surprise, Luis offered to block the space for me as I pull out and then pull back in.  It only took me 2 minutes to get this done but the fact that he offered to go the extra mile to help me speaks volume on his exemplary customer service.   If the food was excellent, I would have given this place 5 stars, but since the food was good but not necessarily excellent, I'm giving this restaurant 4 star, again predominantly for Luis' superlative customer service than the food.  The garlic chicken dish was not as tender as my personal palate would have preferred (possibly over cooked and hence somewhat on the dry side). I also felt that the sauce was a bit salty for my personal palate (but most restaurants are a little too salty for my low sodium preference).  I did enjoy my cucumber reviver drink however. I don't review all the restaurants I eat at, only ones that either impressed me or unimpressed me.  I'm not so sure I would associate my receiving outstanding service to the training at CPK because if this were the case, I would have been equally impressed by my waiter, which I wasn't.  He did a decent enough job but it wasn't necessarily anything to write home about.   I made it a point to look at Luis uniform the next time he walked by so I could see his name tag, only then did I discover that he was a culinary lead.  All this time I thought he was just a busboy.  I'm not sure what a culinary lead is necessarily but that ""lead"" tells me he must be a leader of some sort.  I can totally see why CPK elected to make him a leader.  He not only represents his company well, he is truly a deserving asset to this restaurant.  It's the small simple thing like this (which most can do but won't) that makes a visit memorable and an employee to stand out above the rest.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-santa-monica,2.88,3.19,3.19,,3.066
