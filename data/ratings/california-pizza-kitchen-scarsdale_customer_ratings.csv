66,A.J. S.,"Hackensack, NJ",16,64,3.0,3.0,2012-05-30,"It was fine. A Sunday afternoon shopping and we drove past it. My daughter suggested we eat there. I said I had never been, so she said, ""we're going!"" We sat quickly even though it was pretty packed. Many families, lots of kids, I guess I was expecting something a bit more upward but, no matter. We ordered several apps, a steak quesadilla, a big salad and some mini tacos. All were fine. The main courses were Pizza, of course. Pear and Gorgonzola, yummy. ubiquitous BBQ chicken, again fine. Nothing earth shattering, but pleasant enough. The server was pleasant but oh, so slow. Apparently, they need more wait staff. When we did get her attention, I mentioned the wait. From then on she hurried so I am guessing it wasn't her fault, just too many tables and too many demands.  Perfectly acceptable. Enjoy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-scarsdale?start=60,3.1480000000000006,3.1480000000000006,3.1480000000000006,3.1480000000000006,3.1480000000000006

I think they should find a better way of calling people if they have that many people waiting either get their number and text them like some City places do or give Buzzers and Buzz them when the table is ready like cheesecake factory does. My wife ordered a 5 cheese pizza and i order the Penne with pesto sauce and chicken, Wifey did not like the pizza at all it was very soggy on the bottom it looked like they didnt dry the plates before they put the pie on it and not tasty at all, my pasta was aldente the way i want it but there was so much cream on it than pesto sauce the chicken i didnt like at all very small pieces, u littly had to digg in and look for them.

36,Miche M.,"Bronx, NY",3,40,,2.0,2013-01-03,"After hearing so much about this place, and having passed it several times, we ventured out in the snow on Saturday evening and got there around 6. The decor is nice, and considering the weather was pretty full. It's nicely lit, music was ok and it's clean. I like the open kitchen too, having worked in the industry, it's always nice to have a nose and see how things are being run these days.  The menu is pretty good with a lot of delicious looking and sounding items. My friend opted for the thin crust cheese pizza and I opted for the Kung Pao Spaghetti with Chicken. The place was quiet, there were a few tables in, and yet, the service was cat. Our waitress was very inattentive and when our food arrived, my friend had no utensils. She was eating a pizza but still.  My Kung Pao Spaghetti was ok. It was spicy, but there was just no taste of anything off it. I've had this happen in the Cheesecake Factory too. Just no flavor. Very disappointing.  The dessert menu is pretty BLAH so we just got the check. Not impressed and won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-scarsdale?start=40,3.72,3.72,3.72,3.1440000000000006,3.7200000000000006

This California Pizza Kitchen is a well-oiled MACHINE! Nicely decorated, though a little tight. The hostess at the entrance was very friendly and sat us in barely five minutes on a Friday night. Our server, Mike, commented on how nicely my boyfriend and I were dressed and stated that we were the best dressed couple in the restaurant and proceeded to speak to us in an Australian accent for the rest of the night. Not even joking... but it was hilarious. This has the regular menu of a California Pizza Kitchen but to my diet-riddled delight, a ""New Adventures"" menu with choices under 650 calories. I ordered a shrimp scampi pasta with fresh zucchini and garlic. It was surprisingly good and not too salty! We also shared the Chicken Tinga quesadilla which was crispy and wonderfully cheesy. Also, unlike the one downtown, they gave us yummy warm bread and olive oil.   (we walked from the 20 bus stop a few blocks down, mmkay). Of course, it's a chain restaurant in the middle of Scarsdale... you know there's going to be kids, but it wasn't a chaotic scene at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-scarsdale?start=40,3.6,3.6,3.6,3.504,3.6000000000000005

87,Rod B.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",12,211,,2.0,2013-10-11,"We came here twice in the past few years. The first time was nice. We both had the spinach-asparagus spaghetti with salmon. We both finished ours completely. The second time was the standard chain restaurant makes you regret returning routine. We had the spinach-asparagus spaghetti which was bad. There was a random splash of alfredo sauce and we did not finish it. The Hawaiian pizza was very bland and had no taste. I tried pouring on the parmesan cheese which did not have any taste either and I really poured it on. Our server really could care less about us and he had no problem showing it. We were ignored the whole time (minus the obligatory one time stop to ask how is everything). We had water and coffee and never got refills. He rarely walked by and when he did he never looked at our table. We went during lunch time and there were 3 tables total including ours. We had to wait awhile to get our plates cleared and waited awhile to get the check and pay it. He made it seem like we had to beg him to pay. ""Oh please please can I give you my money?"" ""Oh pretty please may I pay?"" ""Please please please take my money."" That is how it was with that long of a wait for such a low crowd. The only other explanation for his apathy is that he is incompetent and cannot handle 3 tables at once. Maybe in another couple of years we will try again if it is still open but not going back any sooner than that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-scarsdale?start=80,3.6,3.6,3.6,3.3040000000000003,3.6000000000000005

And, the complimentary italian bread slices w/butter were like an appetizer for me. HOWEVER, CPK decided to make not one, but TWO fatal mistakes, costing whatever respect & loyalty I built up towards them. 1. Changing the Traditional Cheese Pizza into the Un-traditional Cheese Pizza, resulting in less cheese, less sauce, and more end-crust. BIG MISTAKE! 2. Phasing out the complimentary italian bread slices w/butter for some tiny baguettes w/olive oil. UNBELIEVABLE!

I've tried other things on their menu...and I'm not exactly impressed but what can you expect from a chain restaurant, really?  They're supposed to be known for their pizzas, but I think they are ok at best. It's New York for Gods sake, who goes to a chain restaurant to get pizza?  I used to love the dumplings here but they have been on a steady decline, they used to be crispy and delicious...but now they're just sad and soggy.

Their food is always great and if you don't like what you ordered they will gladly take it back and give you your usual. I think the rewards program they have now sucks because no one really knows how to use it there - maybe they need to teach their staff. Would be so much easier if there was just a rewards card instead of smartphone app for discounts (CPK pizza dough). TIP: download the app before going there.

First, the lite menu offering if the chili poblano was lukewarm (given that it was Labor Day evening and the place was half full, this was inexcusable) and the surrounding greenish yellow corn sauce surrounding the dish was pretty unappetizing looking. Perhaps a dish that needs rethinking. Also it was not evenly spiced. My sobs pizza was great, and I wished I was eating his meal instead. Then, I ordered my free birthday treat if the salted caramel pudding which I've had before and lived, but being by myself this time and eating it solo I ordered it without the whipped cream and fit a half filled container. While I realized how much cream makes up this dessert, what happened to the salted caramel sauce? None!

However, okay service doesn't help the fact that the food was below average. We ordered three pizzas and one appetizer. The appetizer, the Spinach & Artichoke dip, was a gloopy microwaved mess with bland chips. The Fresh Tomato & Mozzarella was alright. Decently textured mozzarella cheese with each bite. The BBQ pizza was alright as well.  However, this was all ruined by this weird, funky salad pizza thing. The sauce did not taste good and there was too much lettuce on top & not enough of the other toppings.

11,Doug A.,"White Plains, NY",0,5,,3.0,2017-01-14,"I've been coming to this location for years - it's always been one of my favorite go-to casual restaurants. That said, I've been recently been noticing a disturbing trend re: quality and quantity. The last few visits, I've ordered one of the many pizzas on the menu. What was once a great personal pizza has become a comical facsimile: First and foremost, the pizzas themselves have gotten smaller, and anyone who says differently is not paying attention. Second: The actual ""pizza to bread"" ratio has taken a nosedive. To explain, look at the circle of pizza from above. The ""content"" of the pizza has gotten closer and closer to the middle of the circle, and the outer ""crust"" area has gotten lager and larger. As a result, you have a circle of dough with a barely passable central section of actual food. Lastly, the amount of featured toppings has decreased noticeably: For example, whereas the garlic chicken pizza used to have a bunch of chicken and other toppings all over the pizza, now there's a few chicken scraps and a topping or two strewn about haphazardly on the cheese. Of course, despite all of this, the price has remained the same! Now, it's not all negative: The service and atmosphere has remained consistently good throughout the years, and the soups and some salads are still decent. I know some people will comment that I should ""expect"" that restaurants have been offering less and less for your dollar over the last few years, but this is no excuse, nor should it be an ""acceptable"" practice. (I mean, I stopped going to Outback Steakhouse on a regular basis because their serving became so tiny it was laughable -- their bloomin' onion is half the size it used to be).

They had Chef aprons, coloring books, etc. it was a very nice set up",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-scarsdale,3.28,3.28,3.28,,3.2800000000000002

1,Jeanna L.,"New Rochelle, NY",30,58,111.0,3.0,2017-08-25,"After trying their frozen pizzas I decided that the real thing is probably worth a shot. I was surprised by the ambiance of the whole place before going I thought it would be like Panera Bread but, it isn't. It's a sit down restaurant.  Me and my boyfriend ordered the spinach artichoke dip and mushroom pizza to share. Service was very fast and the waitress was really nice and helpful. The dip was weird, it had some kind of tang to it. Could of been cheesier and cheaper. We didn't finish it and we are not ones to back out of spinach artichoke dip. The mushroom pizza had lots of mushrooms but, once again lacked cheese. I enjoyed it but, I wasn't wowed...the amount of flour on the crust was insane. We didn't get the truffle oil because $1.50 on a $15+ pizza... Overall I'd have to go back and try other items from the menu. I think it's overpriced and could use some improvements.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-scarsdale,3.24,3.59,3.59,,3.45
6,Raymond M.,"Yonkers, NY",0,20,,1.0,2017-09-09,"What a horrible experience with this restaurant. First time my family and I went, the pizza was tasteless and they did not give us what we asked for. NO ONIONS on the pizza! The second time we went, we waited for 15 minutes for the waiter to come and take our orders. The waiter came and took our order and when the food came out, the only thing that tasted decent was my child's mini pizza. That was it, we agreed that this will be the last time we go to this California Pizza place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-scarsdale,3.24,3.56,3.56,,3.432000000000001

The Murray Hill branch is our favorite branch but I remember when it gets so busy the attitude of the staffs back there changes to less pleasing. In Scarsdale, its the other way around. The food they serve in here is what you typically expect in a CPK... good pizza, salad and pastas. Nothing really fancy. This is not a fine dining italian place anyways. I'm just please because of the good attitude of the staffs and the cleanliness of this branch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-scarsdale,3.24,3.56,3.56,,3.432000000000001
