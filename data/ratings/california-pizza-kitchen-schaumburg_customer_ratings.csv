126,Farzana P.,"Kenosha, WI",30,2,,3.0,2012-01-31,So me my sister and her friend wanted some pizza! And my sis suggested this place. So we started with appetizers and got the crispy fried mac-n-cheese. It didn't take very long and looked pretty good. But there were only 4 on the plate and they were bite size. I took a bite and it was a bit bitter. We also ordered the 5 cheese pizza and it kind of a meaty taste to it. And it didn't have much taste. The last thing was garlic noodles. They smelled WAY too much like garlic. And there wasn't enough sauce. I am not sure if I will come back to this place since I live so far.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-schaumburg?start=100,3.48,3.48,3.48,2.732,3.4800000000000004
50,Jeremy C.,"Chicago, IL",63,336,1.0,3.0,2012-02-15,I now consider myself the worlds foremost expert critic of cpk's.... In the last year I feel like I've been to more cpk's than the rest of my whole previously combined.. Anyway... This is a super suburban location in the suburbs right across from woodfield. Expect lots of families here doing the post mall shopping eating here.  Let me give this place an unusual comment.. Usually at EVERY cpk you get the sourdough bread with some packets for solid cement frozen butter packets.. This place actually had room temp packets. I liked that for once... :) Service here hasn't as good as I've had at other cpk's but I def thought the food quality was very good..

We had: Chicken quesodila (sp chk) from their small plate menu. it was tasty but overpriced for $5 for 4 small triangles. Hawaiian BBQ pizza- the star of the dinner. Ive had it frozen but never fresh and I would definitely go back for more! Im excited to try their other pizzas. Fish tacos - i am a fish taco feen and unfortunately both my favorite locations to get fish tacos are no longer serving it. This was the worst of the items we ordered. The cabbage that came on top was quite bitter and there was just not enough flavor from the fish, coleslaw or ranchito sauce. Broccoli and sundried tomato pasta- our waitress accidentally brought us the  tomato basil dish, which looked quite appetizing. She was the one who suggested we get the broccoli and tomato pasta. well she corrected the error.

If you want bread you'll have to ask, but I like the sourdough that they have there.

Ordered a jerk chicken pizza with bits of bacon, chicken and veggies on it.  It was ok, but didn't really blow my socks off.  Was a bit lacking with the sauce, but overall, not really sure I'd order it again.  It really sort of made me not really want to try any other pizza on the menu.   I ordered Korean steak tacos... (who does that at a pizza joint??).  Evidently, I was on some weird stuff that day, but I did it anyway.  It was actually not bad, however for two small tacos and almost 6 bucks, it's really not worth it. What really surprised me was the garlic cream fettuccine with shrimp and chicken.  My wife and I found ourselves chowing down on that more than the pizza, appetizers or anything else.  It was actually quite good.

We haven't been to CPK in a while and it seemed like it would be a nice change of pace from the typical places we go. Gotta say, they've upped their game since the last time I was there. We split a nice white corn guacamole appetizer and a really tasty roasted artichoke and spinach pizza.   Some interesting and unique food, done well. The guac was fresh and the flavors on the pizza were really excellent.  Full without being overpowering. I was really pleased with each dish and the meal overall.

The on call manager Bruce Marvin needs to be re-educated in customer service. We have been going to this location for over 5 years, & almost every time my wife orders the fish tacos with a simple substitution of their salsa & chips for a side Caesar salad at no extra charge. Bruce is under the impression that this dish priced $10.75 should have a $2 up charge for the salad, when other sandwich dishes offer the salad as a side item already. He stated bluntly & rudely that the up charge had something to do with their price point cost difference. I know from my experience that the salad's ingredients are cheaper than the salsa and chips, when purchased in bulk from the supplier.  I have ample experience as a restaurant manager from my days at Denny's, obviously ""the customer is always right,"" does not apply for this restaurant. I refuse to pay their stupid up charge. We simply got up and left. I hope you get retrained or let go Bruce. I put in a call to your corporate office, and will continue to call until something is done to fix this situation.

Today, we had their chicken & shrimp lettuce wraps ($12.75) and works thin crust pizza ($15.25).  Lettuce wraps - 2.5 stars. Good, but not worth $13 Works pizza - 1 star at that price. The crust was crisp on the edges (good), floppy elsewhere. It reminded me of a non-toasted tortilla, in a bad way. Cheese and sauce were a huge letdown. Flavorless cheese and not enough sauce! I only ate a few bites of my slice. The max I would pay is $10, but even then, it'd rate lower than Home Run Inn's frozen pizza that I'd get for $6. Easily can make a better pizza.

Fortunately, their beverage service is free flowing. Right now they serve Pepsi products but the server made a strong point that they were changing to Coke products in two weeks.

But for whatever reason, I stop at this CPK today and I admit is was really good. I had a small plate blue cheese wedge with bacon and a hard boiled egg on it which was fantastic along with this great bread they bring you with herb and olive oil for dipping. Then I had the California club pizza which has chicken, bacon, a pile of rocket tossed in dressing along with slices of fresh avocado on their thin crust. Super good and light. Half is plenty for lunch so the other half goes in a box for supper later. Real good service also.

The bean sprouts and carrots were excellent - clean and crunchy. I would have liked the thin crust to have been a bit crisper. The strawberry and watermelon fields salad was great - the dressing blending in with the fruit instead of overwhelming it. I would have liked to have seen the waiter a bit more - I didn't get a refill of water until I was almost done with my meal although he was pleasant when he did come by. An extra napkin or two when the meal was served would have been nice since pizza is a finger food. Great atmosphere and enjoyed the background music too.

You can always tell when corporate has started dictating service standards because they all sound the same and you really don't get personalities anymore. I can't imagine they have the kind of fun working here now as when they first opened stores almost 30 years ago. The food here is always good even though they tend to add/remove dishes alot. They've lost some good dishes - Cajun Pizza, Black Bean Angel Hair. My biggest problem with CPK now is I no longer can afford to eat here as often as I'd like. I used to go once a week but now I just go every few months. Their prices are crazy - $10 for a half salad?? Pasta dishes for $13+. Every thing has gone through the roof. Those tiny little flatbread things are like $5 or $6. Every time owner ship changes the prices go up to feed a new crop of overpaid execs I guess. Started with the founders Rick and Larry and it was a little high, but I didn't see a price hike for years.

As we walked in this short haired blonde woman who was supposed to be the greeter completely ignored us. We approached her to tell her we were here as a party of 11 and she was overall indifferent and seemed to have some complexities and a power struggle because she wanted to seat us at separate tables and refused to push them in together. She didn't e plain why they couldn't be pushed together and claimed that a larger area would be an hour late---keep in mind we were the only ones waiting and this was at 8:30 and the restaurant was not ridiculously busy at all for a Friday night. She then didn't even escort us to the table...she basically just pointed the table out to us. Completely rude and unacceptable. Our server was very kind and another server or manager saw what was going on and he offered to push the two tables together. The food was just fine and very standard for what cpk is. The manager was making rounds to ask everyone how they were enjoying the food and how everything was going. He seemed to completely ignore our table---the huge table of 11. Don't know how he can miss us but he somehow totally did... We tipped very generously as our server was kind.

Shortly after she approached us again but yet again she walked passed us to the same table and started to clean up. It was clear she had no intention of acknowledging us.
