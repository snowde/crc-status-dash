34,Arielle S.,"Manhattan, NY",385,336,,4.0,2012-03-29,"First off, I would like to thank our waitress for dealing with my pain in the ass family. My family insists on switching tables, placing soup orders when asked what drinks we want, tasting each others drinks/soup and then bugging the waitress to add another to the order. The waitress very calmly put up with all these shaninigans. We tried a soup to start off with. I believe it was called sedona. If you have ever tasted the smart ones frozen meal ""sante fe style rice and beans"", it actually tasted like that but in soup format. sounds weird---but was very tasty.  We split 3 different pizzas. All were good but I will list them in order of how good: 1. Roasted Garlic Chicken Pizza 2. Thai Chicken Pizza 3.

The Sicilian Pizza is my fav...I always get it.  This location does a good job at delivering a tasty old favorite.  Of course, the Pepperoni is a classic and they do it well. For dessert, the Belgian Chocolate Souffle is awesome...very rich.  I split it with The Better Half. Service here is so/so....they have some young kids who you can tell it's their first serving job.  They're nice though, but need to learn the more refined aspects of customer service.....like making sure your Wine glass is never empty and offering dessert....we had to ask.

I had a pizza with the Gluten Free dough.  I guess that was my fault.  It was doughy and undercooked with no flavor.  If I go to any CPK again I won't order that.  My biggest complaint was the bar service.  I sat right across from the bar service.  I ordered a full glass of Cabernet.  The waitress (who was very polite and sweet) delivered it with a smile.  I stopped her and explained that I had ordered a full glass, not a half glass.  She apologized and said it was a full glass but it would show up as two 1/2 glasses on my bill.  (my suspicious mind begins).  I'm watching the bartender.  he's making two strawberry Martguerita's or daiquiris.  He pours them out and one comes up very short.  So, instead of adding a little more alcohot and giving it another shake, he holds the glass under the sink and tops it off with tap water.  I stared at him and shook my head and he ignored me.

78,Susan P.,"Cave Creek, AZ",0,2,,1.0,2013-08-29,"I have eaten at several California Pizza Kitchen locations around the country.  Anytime I see one, I go because it seems relatively consistent and reliable. My experience a few nights ago at this location, though, was absolutely disappointing.  When we first sat down, I ordered a glass of water and a full glass of their house Pinot Noir.  The water never came, and our spunky little waitress returned with a glass of white wine.  Confused, I politely asked for a glass of Pinot Noir again, and specified that it was a red wine.  She argued and said, ""No, you ordered Pinot Grigio, so here."" So, I drank it anyways because I am not the arguing type.  When it came time to order, we ordered spinach dip as an appetizer, and my friend and I split a full-size BBQ chicken salad and a mushroom pepperoni sausage pizza on a thin crust for our entrees. Considering this is three of, what I assume to be, their most popular items, I expected the exceptional quality of food I usually receive there.  The spinach dip, which was cold, came out at the same time as the salad and pizza. The pizza wasn't on a thin crust. The waitress never returned to ask for refills or anything, so we had to flag down another waiter for our bill. All in all, disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-scottsdale?start=60,2.5640000000000005,2.5640000000000005,2.5640000000000005,2.5640000000000005,2.564000000000001
39,Morgan D.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,1,,2.0,2013-10-14,"Our waiter, Chris, was fantastic. But the so-called manager, April, is condescending and rude. I don't understand how someone like this can represent a place we usually love. We go to this location about twice a month. My wife usually orders the same thing, but decided to try something new. My wife made a poor decision about what she wanted to eat. She ended up not liking it and we were apologetic to our waiter. My wife had no more than two bites of the dish she didn't enjoy. The waiter was great, and offered my wife something else on the menu. After the waiter walked away, this ""manager"", April, came over and started telling us about how that's one of the most popular items on the menu and why everyone likes it. We apologized for not liking it (doesn't that seem ridiculous in itself?), and admitted it was a poor choice on our behalf. She continued to almost lecture us as to why that dish was good. She even pointed out other people in the restaurant who were eating it. Who cares? We already said it was our fault. Why are you hassling us? By the time April left our table, my wife got her new pasta. It was cold. And I mean, the sauce had hardened and the bottom of the bowl was barely warm. Again, being extremely polite with our waiter, we apologized and asked him to reheat it. The server was beyond apologetic and said that it was completely unacceptable to receive a dish in that state (note that our sever did not bring the food over, someone else did). I can not enthuse any more how great our waiter was. He left to get the dish remade or reheated. Back comes ""manager"" April and says ""didn't like THAT one either?"" Like we were trying to get something out of this. We explained that the dish was cold. All she said was ""ok"" and walked away. No apology or anything. In fact, still in an accusing matter. We stopped another server, her name I don't recall, to ask if April was the general manager. It turns out this girl is just a glorified server. A shift manager. Why would the managers here allow such a person to represent them, their restaurant and their staff? When we got our check, it had the first dish on there, and we made no comment to take it off the bill as it was our mistake. Our waiter, Chris, came back over and said he had asked his ""manager"" to take it off the check but she had probably just 'forgotten'. Based on her attitude, highly unlikely. Not that we wouldn't have happily paid for it. It took about 10 minutes for our new check to come back to us as we watched our waiter, seemingly, having to argue with the girl to get the dish removed. As we left, April was at the door and said ""at least you know what you won't get next time"". Yes, thank you for that very obvious and unnecessary comment. Our waiter was wonderful. We highly recommend Chris. On the other hand, if we walk into that restaurant again and see April ""managing"", we will walk across the road to Macaroni Grill instead. Such a shame that ONE girl had to ruin a place we usually enjoy. Tip to the actual managers- get that girl OUT of her power position. She is incapable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-scottsdale?start=40,2.7920000000000007,2.7920000000000007,2.7920000000000007,2.7920000000000007,2.7920000000000007

I ordered a pizza but had a change to make on it: I wanted thin crust toppings on a regular crust. He said no prob. My daughter ordered the spinach and artichoke thin crust pie while her boyfriend got the spaghetti bolognese.  Spaghetti was fairly bland, pretty much due to a non-aggressive chef choices.  The spinach and artichoke pizza was very good with a crisp crust and ample toppings. The meat lovers had really good toppings but the crust?  It looked like they tacked a ring of dough onto a thin crust pizza. Some of you like thin crust but not me.

I love the look of this place- trendy décor and a pretty sleek design concept. They have a fairly large menu and a lot of food choices ranging from salads, to pasta, to pizza and a few Asian inspired dishes as well, surprisingly. One thing I really appreciate is the complimentary bread & olive oil. Restaurants seem to be quickly moving away from the ""free bread"" model much to my chagrin! But luckily, CPK hasn't. They served us a small loaf of yummy, crusty Italian bread that was warm & very soft in the middle. For the entrees my boyfriend went with the shrimp scampi zucchini- it had some tasty looking zucchini ribbons and fettucine pasta with scampi sauce and shrimp. He was pleased with the serving size and taste. I ordered the pesto cream penne and was much less enthusiastic. I think I expected it to be more ""pesto-ey""? Any other time I've ordered a pesto based pasta dish somewhere, the sauce is actually green and I can taste some pesto. Well...can't say that's the case here. It looked like they served me regular penne with a trace of cream sauce, a few shrimp, and a TON of sun-dried tomatoes. Waaaay too many sun dried tomatoes and not enough shrimp or pesto.

The service is fast efficient super friendly staff waiters know their menus well. I think CPK need to step up their looks they need to make it sunny like California warm & inviting at the same time rich in decor add color & style for God's sake if  these guys made their place look like a million bucks they could be best everybody else.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-scottsdale,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68
