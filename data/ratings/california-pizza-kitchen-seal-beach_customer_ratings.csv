Just OK service.  We had to ask for silverware after our waitress brought the food, we had to ask for peppers twice.

I said no, in a pretty ticked off tone, because she had definitely seen me sitting there not helped for that period of time. I don't know if she didn't know if I was in her section or not? Or if she was just too busy chatting it up with other customers, but by the time she came to take my drink order, I was more than ready to order my food too. She asked if I wanted bread, I said no, and she immediately brought bread anyways..

About over 1 year ago my son was eating his favorite Penne Cream Pasta and there was a piece of a metal brillow pad in his food, this is what they scub the pans with.  Yes they comped his plate and brought out a new dish, and said sorry, but that was all. Last night some how he cut the top of his tongue.  My son said that he bit his tongue and I looked and didn't see anything, but later that night he was bleeding profusely and it took a while to stop.  Though the cut was on top of the tongue and that made it difficult to imagine that my 10 year old could bite it there.  So I am thinking that something in the food cut him somehow.  Thank god that what ever it was didn't cut his throat when he swallowed it.   So go at your own risk.  I think a little quality control will go a long way at this location.  We hope to see a change here soon or else we will not go again.   I really hope that the management reads these reviews.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seal-beach?start=80,2.56,2.53,2.53,2.568,2.542

Thanks to the response from April (RM I presume) and the clear up of facts, the man who claimed to be the GM Darren, in fact was NOT the GM Darren, but another manager named Tony. Darren, I apologize. You're off the hook, but you should remove worthless managers from your staff. Leadership comes from the top and if not removed will cause the staff to act outside of company protocol. They will cause your business to lose money and that's what matters. The bottom line. I still will probably not ever visit this CPK again. I haven't actually gone to a CPK since the ""incident"" and it will be a long while until I step foot into another CPK establishment. But thank you April and Darren for setting the facts straight.  Prior review (8/1/2014): **DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY AT THIS PLACE!! LAKEWOOD CPK IS EXCELLENT. TINA IS THE BEST GM ANYWHERE!

How hard is it to swap out to thin spaghetti and cook a crust thoroughly, especially when it was told to be well done. I will not come back to this place EVER. 40$ for 2 dishes, no drinks, and bullshit customer service is not worth it.     Their server (can't remember her name) was awesome.

51,Chani B.,"Long Beach, CA",4,4,10.0,2.0,2014-08-01,"Updated review (8/29/2014):   It took three weeks for me to hear anything back from CPK management in regards to this ""incident"". Thanks to the response from April (RM I presume) and the clear up of facts, the man who claimed to be the GM Darren, in fact was NOT the GM Darren, but another manager named Tony. Darren, I apologize. You're off the hook, but you should remove worthless managers from your staff. Leadership comes from the top and if not removed will cause the staff to act outside of company protocol. They will cause your business to lose money and that's what matters. The bottom line. I still will probably not ever visit this CPK again. I haven't actually gone to a CPK since the ""incident"" and it will be a long while until I step foot into another CPK establishment. But thank you April and Darren for setting the facts straight.  Prior review (8/1/2014): **DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY AT THIS PLACE!! LAKEWOOD CPK IS EXCELLENT. TINA IS THE BEST GM ANYWHERE! I go to CPK a lot.. and when I say a lot, I mean like every week at least twice. This is the 2nd time this specific CPK has not only fucked up my order, the asshole old man of a GM Darren, had the audacity to act as if I fucked up my order. No, YOUR COOKS fucked up my order. How hard is it to swap out to thin spaghetti and cook a crust thoroughly, especially when it was told to be well done. I will not come back to this place EVER. 40$ for 2 dishes, no drinks, and bullshit customer service is not worth it.     Their server (can't remember her name) was awesome.

At around 6:30pm on October 24th,  I was told by the rude hostess that it will take 30 minutes to prepare our table for our party of 18. She also showed me where they're going to seat us. 40 minutes later, another party walked-in (most of them are wearing USC Trojan jerseys), and the rude hostess gave one of the ladies a hug as they approached the reception desk and discreetly said ""I'm giving you this table but keep it down, they were before you on the list-- pointing at us."" The rude hostess saw me looking at her after saying it and knew that I heard what she just said. I was in the reception area standing behind another person. She's not even bright enough to not even realize that several others and I in our party are right there listening to their conversation!  When I saw the party being seated, I went to the reception desk and asked the rude hostess why our table was given away. She arrogantly gave me the excuse that they cannot accommodate our party on that table. But prior to that, no one cared to ask if it's alright to seat our party somewhere else. This is already more than 30 minutes of waiting.  My husband addressed the matter to Tony, the manager. That was a waste of time! He didn't care what my husband has to say. Tony said ""What do you want me to do about it?""Neither Tony nor the rude and arrogant hostess seems to care about it, even after they were told that this is a birthday dinner.

You know what they're offering and to me, it's pretty much the same as all other CPKs.   I've been here many times, only for family occasions as my parents usually will pick this place, and we've never had a lousy experience with service.  The wait staff is usually a young crew, with a couple of exceptions here and there.  The atmosphere is pretty laid back since it's not in a mall.  We prefer this one over the location off PCH because the parking situation is usually better.   The food is always the same - it's CPK food.  Same old, same old.  As a CPK, it's fine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seal-beach?start=40,2.44,2.88,2.88,3.436,2.704

The food, ranging from the crispy warm bread served with a seasoned olive oil dip, tangy chicken Piccata, scampi zucchini, meaty Bolognese spaghetti, fresh veggie pizza with chicken, to the Belgian chocolate dessert were all well prepared, served warm and delicious.

15,Scott C.,"Long Beach, CA",2,9,,2.0,2017-09-15,"Some competence would be nice. My wife and two daughters, ages 14 and 8 were seated with three menus. Not one of them being a kids menu. Nor were we asked if we would like a kids menu. The table had spilled water on it left from the previous guest, and two sets of silverware. We had to ask for more. I guess our server expected us to share forks. The crawfish in my wife's jambalaya was tough. My daughters potato soup was bland and I can't put my finger on it but my Sicilian pizza was just off. Maybe it was the five minutes after my pizza was served that I was asked if I wanted cheese. All in all a very disappointing decision coming here.

202,Aarti K.,"Denver, United States",219,49,148.0,4.0,2017-11-08,"For the most part, the food is what you would expect - flavorful, but not necessarily extraordinary. Having said that, I would recommend the Spicy Buffalo Cauliflower, which had the perfect amount of heat. I also enjoyed the Chicken Milanese - the panko-crusted chicken was crispy, the diced tomatoes and arugula added some freshness, and the cheese gave the dish a good flavor. I'm not a big fan of their (non-alcoholic) drinks, which were overly sweet. I got the strawberry mango cooler, which was just sugary strawberry soda - I couldn't taste the mango, ginger, or guava that was mentioned in the description. The main reason I liked this CPK location was the service. We went for dinner at a busy time, and were seated within 10 minutes. Our waitress was very attentive and friendly. I've often been frustrated with poor customer service at other chain restaurants, so I was happy with my experience here.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seal-beach,2.48,2.66,2.928,,2.588

We responded, ""Ok we can choose another- Kelsey: And it looks like there aren't any clean tables, so...(while shrugging shoulders) After we were seated we were not greeted by anybody for 5 minutes.
