137,Michelle P.,"Seattle, WA",83,48,9.0,3.0,2012-01-11,Not impressed with the service however the salad I had was great. Roasted veggie salad...DIETING!! :(  I put a lot of value on serve and this waitress was very slow and would walk away in the middle of a sentence so we had to ask twice for the rest of our order. So half the table had their order and the other half watched them eat until the rest of the food arrived.  the kids got all hopped up on sugar (hot fudge sundaes). Still full of energy at home rethinking desert next time we go to dinner. The honey chicken pizza on the kids menu is actually really good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seattle?start=80,3.72,3.35,3.35,2.8920000000000003,3.498
177,Alexandra P.,"Seattle, WA",324,78,23.0,3.0,2012-01-12,"I went here with my family last night, and lets just say, I've had better, even from here...which is why I'm giving it 3 stars and not 2 because I am very well aware of what kind of service this place is capable of. First we had a party of 7, there were plenty of booths that were open up against the wall where some of us could sit in a booth and some in a chair, but we got seated in a booth right next to the kitchen (which had a very peculiar and suspicious smell) and they pulled up an extra chair so someone was right in the line of fire.  Our waitress was gone for, pretty much the entire time. We needed refills on drinks, more napkins for the kids, and there was no one to ask because we were stuck in this little corner the entire time. At one point we even had to get up and go find someone to get the kids dessert because they were getting a little ancy waiting for it.  Regardless of the service the food was still good. Chicken Piccata and the original chopped salad with gorgonzola. The salad probably being my favorite, delicious! I'm sure I'll be back here in the future, I'm not just in too much of a hurry...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seattle?start=100,3.72,3.35,3.35,2.9240000000000004,3.498

99,Kathryn H.,"Kirkland, WA",1,53,,5.0,2012-03-08,"I'm very impressed.  It's been quite awhile since I've been to a restaurant where the entire staff actually cares about being there and as importantly, cares that the customer is there.  Gavin was our waiter and he was excellent.  His appearance was professional, had a genuine smile, and knew his menu.  He was without a doubt a 10.  My friend arrived first and she was greeted promptly and then I arrived and was also greeted within a couple of minutes.  He wasn't pushy and checked on us at perfect times throughout our meal.  The manager, don't know her name, blond and very personable, was on the floor and really cared about the customers needs.   The staff seemed to be very cohesive.  As for the food, we split a bbq chicken salad and Gavin split it without us even having to ask.  It was decicious and was served on well-chilled plates..so delicious.  We also shared a pizza, which was very tasty, it was a new one, can't remember the name, but could have used more cheese for my taste.  I liked their wine by the glass selection.  Not the ususal boring Kendall Jackson and Chateau Ste Michelle.  Ordered key lime pie for dessert, which was very good and a fresh cup of coffee.  This place is in a Mall and so I wasn't expecting much.  They have their act together. Final note:  We arrived in the late afternoon and stayed for a few hours, talking business.  We were not once rushed.  We will be back! THANK YOU!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seattle?start=140,3.68,3.35,3.35,3.124,3.482

This chain is a scam. I guess if you hear enough people say a chain is so wonderful  and so great someone will believe it.

The works pizza and jalapeno carnitas pizza were great. I loved the jalapeno carnitas one a tad bit more. It came with a little side of sauce. The pizza itself wasn't spicy, BUT I can eat really spicy food, so it may be spicy to some of you who are reading this. The sauce had this kick, not right when you eat it, but after a short while. I thought it was great.  However, I do feel that $13 for a 10-inch pizza is a little much.

But I worked at the mall for about a year and a half, and if I wanted to get food after work at someplace a bit nicer than the food court or Chipotle, this was one of the better options. I would not recommend it for PIZZA pizza (tomato sauce, cheese, pepperoni, GREASE) but they do have a lot of interesting specialty pizzas. The menu is quite large and diverse. It does kind of have that overall blandness that I've come to associate with chain restaurants -- while everything I've tried is good, nothing was particularly exciting or unexpected. Actually, that's not true -- they have pizzas with salad ON THEM. That's pretty unusual, unless it's a California thing; I wouldn't know. I haven't tried one because they just sound weird. The personal pizza is usually a bit too big for me to eat in one sitting, but leftovers are nice. It's worth getting a box for your leftovers instead of stuffing yourself here, because they have good desserts. Key Lime Piiiieeeee.... The drinks are also good. I love love love their dessert coffee drink Almond Joy, which includes amaretto, coconut rum and chocolate syrup. Yummmm. Here's the thing that always bothers me about this place, though. They have a very strange service policy, that apparently is enforced by corporate, that I don't like. Servers all introduce themselves in their flat, scripted way (""Hi! I'm John and I'll be serving you tonight! Can I tell you about our specials?"") and every time I've eaten there, the manager on duty has come around at least once during the meal and asked us how we are doing. This might seem like a nice touch, but it feels very corporate-enforced. I've had two separate managers do this, a man and a woman, and both of them seemed almost suspicious of their servers. ""Is everything okay? Reeeally?"" It was a weird attitude to have, because we were doing just fine, and it made me feel like there was something weird going on except that this seems to happen every time (I've asked some co-workers if they had that happen too, and they all did.)

The manager, don't know her name, blond and very personable, was on the floor and really cared about the customers needs.   The staff seemed to be very cohesive.  As for the food, we split a bbq chicken salad and Gavin split it without us even having to ask.  It was decicious and was served on well-chilled plates..so delicious.  We also shared a pizza, which was very tasty, it was a new one, can't remember the name, but could have used more cheese for my taste.  I liked their wine by the glass selection.  Not the ususal boring Kendall Jackson and Chateau Ste Michelle.  Ordered key lime pie for dessert, which was very good and a fresh cup of coffee.  This place is in a Mall and so I wasn't expecting much.  They have their act together. Final note:  We arrived in the late afternoon and stayed for a few hours, talking business.  We were not once rushed.  We will be back!

We needed refills on drinks, more napkins for the kids, and there was no one to ask because we were stuck in this little corner the entire time.

There were probably 30 or so guests sitting in the dining area and only two servers and a manager-looking type woman....who didn't do much of anything even though she was frantically running around.  My Food: Starter- the guacamole  ($3.99) The portion was small for the hoard of chips that accompanied it. But it was very tasty. Up the portion and I would eat it for lunch everyday. Entree: half of the Asian Chicken Salad ($9.99) very good, I loved the crunch it had and the peanut sauce. Maybe a bit on the salty side, but I ate it all; I was hungry.  Monica was my server, but she was in a rush to assist her dining room guests so I was mostly assisted by the manager on duty.  Every time Monica asked the manager for help with an easy task, the manager would either attempt it and fail, or ignore her request all together. Even the hostess was able to dart to the kitchen and run some food!!!!!  At one point, the manager was ringing a to go order with the guest standing right there, and had some issue with the cash register! Wouldn't you know it, even though she was slammed, Monica stepped in and finished the transaction.  I also noticed that the hot pizzas were sitting out, waiting to be delivered for too long. No one was to blame as the two servers were trying to tackle the near impossible.  It's employees like Monica that really keep a restaurant in businesss. If her pace had slowed in the least, it would have resulted in angry customers and cold food. Even though she didn't order or deliver my food (the manager did), she was still very kind and checked in with me enough for me to tip her handsomely and give her an honest compliment on her work ethic.  Contrastingly, it's people like this manager that can drag a business down. More servers should be hired on the weekend so the employees don't experience burnout and the guests are happily fulfilled. Also, the manager should know how to do almost every task to better support the employees....just in case it gets busy (like today).

My Food: Starter- the guacamole  ($3.99) The portion was small for the hoard of chips that accompanied it. But it was very tasty. Up the portion and I would eat it for lunch everyday. Entree: half of the Asian Chicken Salad ($9.99) very good, I loved the crunch it had and the peanut sauce. Maybe a bit on the salty side, but I ate it all; I was hungry.  Monica was my server, but she was in a rush to assist her dining room guests so I was mostly assisted by the manager on duty.  Every time Monica asked the manager for help with an easy task, the manager would either attempt it and fail, or ignore her request all together. Even the hostess was able to dart to the kitchen and run some food!!!!!  At one point, the manager was ringing a to go order with the guest standing right there, and had some issue with the cash register! Wouldn't you know it, even though she was slammed, Monica stepped in and finished the transaction.  I also noticed that the hot pizzas were sitting out, waiting to be delivered for too long. No one was to blame as the two servers were trying to tackle the near impossible.  It's employees like Monica that really keep a restaurant in businesss. If her pace had slowed in the least, it would have resulted in angry customers and cold food. Even though she didn't order or deliver my food (the manager did), she was still very kind and checked in with me enough for me to tip her handsomely and give her an honest compliment on her work ethic.  Contrastingly, it's people like this manager that can drag a business down. More servers should be hired on the weekend so the employees don't experience burnout and the guests are happily fulfilled. Also, the manager should know how to do almost every task to better support the employees....just in case it gets busy (like today). Running food, taking orders, making drinks and correctly ringing to-go orders.  They really have great food, but the management side of things needs to shape up.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seattle,2.88,3.13,3.244,2.0920000000000005,3.03

We shared a sangria flight special they had.  There were a few things wrong with our visit. Where to start... We wanted to sit outside and asked if they would turn on the outdoor heater. It was a little brisk out but still a beautiful day. One waiter said sure but they only turn them on in the evenings so she'd have to get someone to turn it on. Once we were seated, another waiter said they aren't working so great right now, so they won't turn it on. Okay... I waited 15 minutes for the bread basket, and when I realized after 3 times the waitress stopped by that it wasn't coming, I asked if they still offer it. She said yes and brought it out a few minutes later. My pasta dish was ok, not great but not bad. I'd give that 3 stars.  The sangria flight was interesting to try, although nothing I would order again. His soup was ok, a little salty and bland though. The sandwich was good, but about 3 bites in he felt a sharp piece of plastic in it.

Service was a bit slow but not the servers (I can't recall her name) fault. From what we could see, there was a bartender and two servers on the floor. Our server did as good a job as possible with the amount of tables she had.  Not sure staffing short was intended though as it was mid afternoon and we came right at the beginning of a ""rush"" our server was polite and best of all, did not hold us hostage with the check.  We felt bad for her even though she never once complained about how busy she was. She handled it like a pro and seemed to enjoy her job.

She took our order and checked on us once.  My husband and I waited and waited for water. When we finally received our pizzas, I was so sad to see that my pizza was cold and under cooked. I was so hungry by the time I received my food that I tried to just eat it. When Jerby came to FINALLY  check on us we asked her for some pepper flakes, a box and our check. she NEVER came back. Instead she was texting on her phone and laughing and ignoring us. She was literally standing by the computer screen texting for 20mins. Unbelievable. I mean, if you're going to text and ignore customers, at least go in the kitchen to do it. We had to ask the hostess to help us since Jerby never came back. The hostess was friendly and prompt and asked Jerby for our check, when we got our check she had charged us for an extra pizza. We asked to have it corrected and even then she took off the cheaper pizza, (which was mine) and left the more expensive pizza, (not ours) on our bill. At this point my husband and I were just so irritated we just paid and left. This was by far the WORST experience in customer service I have EVER received.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seattle?start=20,2.4,2.54,3.0,,2.484

5,Lauren A.,"Lynnwood, WA",71,59,37.0,5.0,2017-08-01,"This was our first time here. Food was beyond amazing and everything tasted fresh.  The kids had pizza and said it was ""very good"" I had the pea and barley soup, half Cesar with avocado added and then the fried Mac n' Cheese which was surprisingly yummy.  Service was a bit slow but not the servers (I can't recall her name) fault. From what we could see, there was a bartender and two servers on the floor. Our server did as good a job as possible with the amount of tables she had.  Not sure staffing short was intended though as it was mid afternoon and we came right at the beginning of a ""rush"" our server was polite and best of all, did not hold us hostage with the check.  We felt bad for her even though she never once complained about how busy she was. She handled it like a pro and seemed to enjoy her job.  The other thing I think is worth mentioning: This restaurant does not add the tip like some in this area which shows me some social justice.  We left a 20% tip because of everything listed above.  I'm grateful to have given this place a shot. We will be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-seattle,2.24,2.58,3.004,,2.444

196,Cindy F.,"Seattle, United States",118,273,930.0,5.0,2017-09-30,"TLDR: serves more than pizza. Very filling.  Dining area has a lot of booths and feels almost like a buffet. Average noise level. I'm pretty impressed with the variety in their menu. There are a lot of Asian style foods along with the typical pizzas. There are apps, small plates, and entrees--not just pizza! I honestly had a hard time not ordering everything I saw.  Service: wait to be seated, order at the table, check brought to table, your table will be bused. Complimentary bread and oil dip: bread is crunchy on the outside and chewy inside. Just how I like it. Oil dip is not very salty but is lightly herby. Smashed Chicken Meatball Piadina: Chicken is very tender and I'm a fan of that crushed tomato--tastes very fresh! Salty and tangy flavors blend nicely. Since it comes with soup I recommend you get the half size at lunch hour--a full size is way too filling especially with the soup! Baked Potato Soup: delightfully chunky and melt in your mouth consistency. Has a slight tang to it and is not too salty. Be warned--it's super filling! Sparkling Cranberry Cooler: a bit on sour side but refreshing nonetheless.

349,Reina Q.,"Oakland, United States",1,96,105.0,1.0,2017-10-02,"Very disappointed with my experience at this location and I haven't been here long enough to get my food? I came in to place a to-go order (the greeter is exceedingly pleasant and helpful- young, brunette- I should ask for her name), the woman who takes the orders (Michaella?) is apparently too busy being idle to acknowledge or assist me in any way. She took so long that I asked the TWO other employees at the bar for help (crickets) because no one speaks except the greeter? So, to my rescue, the exceedingly polite young greeter placed my order. I hesitate to give one star, but the nice receptionist prevented me from leaving all together. If ordering here wasn't a necessity, I would leave. I will NEVER return. I won't make assumptions as to why I'm being ignored, however, no one else here seems to be suffering from a lack of polite/quick service.

When she found out the sauce would be too spicy for her, Louis discussed options for different sauces with her. He clearly wanted to please his customer. When that didn't work out, he suggested another meal that would be more to her liking. She tried something different, but the sauce provided still was too spicy, When she suggested he bring her a plain Caesar dressing, he did so with a smile on his face, I want to compliment him on his patience, goodness of heart, sense of humor, pleasant demeanor, and dedication to his customers.
