Reminds me why I dislike chain resturants, but had a gift card and the only place in this mall with a less than 40 minute wait. Last time I went to a CPK- about 10 years ago.  The pizza was actually good and the salad actually very fresh and tasty. This time a whole different story.   Bbq chicken pizza- pretty bad. Roasted vegetable salad - what a joke!  Wilted lettuce and the ""roasted vegetables"" consisted of one tiny, mushy artichoke and the thinnest sliced red pepper I've ever seen.  Seriously- there were no vegetables on this dish.  Tasteless ""dijon"" dressing.  Should have sent it back but I'm not really like that! And the bbq chicken salad -- don't even get me started. What gets me is this place isn't cheap.. I think my salad was 15 bucks and the total bill wasn't low.  But the quality - the lowest you can go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-short-hills?start=40,2.7560000000000002,2.7560000000000002,2.7560000000000002,2.7560000000000002,2.7560000000000002

17,Dodya R.,"Millburn, NJ",288,52,,3.0,2012-06-06,"I am a huge fan of this restaurant. First off, I want to say that the food there is consistently good. The atmosphere could be improved and they could also improve on making the restaurant less quieter and more adult friendly. The service is always good and when something isn't properly cooked they will take it back and start all over. (Depending in what it was). It was considerably better and of course the cheesecake factory is much better, sometimes. In the end, this is a worthwhile place to dine at and you will definitely enjoy yourself.

We were seated in the corner of the restaurant (near the back patio area) and our server was spot on in coming back and checking up on us. We never ran out of water, she gave us a few minutes to try the food and came back to see how we liked it, asked how everything was... awesome service. The manager was funny, friendly, and opened up our winning card promotional thingy (they're running it through July). It gave us 20% off our meal, which we were happy to take. The food itself was only OK... The spinach artichoke dip was not as good as I remembered (maybe I'm just getting old?) The BBQ chicken salad was good, but somehow, felt a little lacking The new habenaro pizza with pork was OK, textually, but not very flavorful (the hot sauce, which we got on the side, was hot, but without depth). Anyway, even though the food was mediocre (at 2 stars), the service warrants bringing this place up to 3.  Maybe it was just me, but I think I might have finally hit my threshold of CPK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-short-hills?start=40,3.0840000000000005,3.0840000000000005,3.0840000000000005,3.0840000000000005,3.0840000000000005

12,George S.,"Short Hills, NJ",1,41,3.0,3.0,2012-12-17,"BBQ chicken pizza is very good. California club sandwich is really good (the bread is like pizza dough, tasty). Thai crunch salad is good too. Pretty good food, I go here a lot, usually for take out. My main complaint would be orders getting messed up, happens A LOT. At the restaurant or over the phone, have had problems with both. One thing many of you may not know, that I found out the hard way, is that orders over the phone are done through a call center. Sounds ok right? Well it's not ok if the restaurant doesn't receive your order from the call center, which happened once. After talking to the manager, they said it actually happens somewhat regularly which was troubling.

0,Victor A.,"Jersey City, NJ",118,137,38.0,4.0,2013-02-11,So its my first time at California Pizza Kitchen.  I've passed by these a million times and never stopped in.  They're actually pretty good.  I had the mushroom pie.  Very good.  Crispy thin crust.  The menu seems to have a lot of fresh options.  For a chain I have to give kudos.  If I had to choose between the chains this would be a top option.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-short-hills?start=60,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.9600000000000004,3.1600000000000006
87,Salena M.,"Chatham, NJ",45,385,,4.0,2013-02-24,"This is my 2nd rating and is an update worth noting for since the menu items are becoming more adventurous, better quality and more choices available than the usual pizza, salad and pasta items. Met Anthony, manager of restaurant.  He was informative and friendly to us.  The Short Hills restaurant is flagged for various pilot programs - new menu items and the way they manage staff.   Worth mentioning on new menu items is their white corn guacamole with blue and white corn chips... this was light and exceptional in flavor--the combined ingredients didn't overwhelm each other....Similar to a double shot of espresso,  this dish would be perfect as a double shot.  Tried the spicy stuffed poblano - tasty overall but too rich and a mish-mash of flavors when the pepper is drowning in a pool of sauce. They should lighten up the load of the sauce and lucky me.. my poblano wasn't spicy at all even though it's called spicy. One con I have for this place is if they can offer multi-grain bread (which is healthier!) instead of white.  The spinach artichoke dip is still consistently delicious!  As for kids pizza - order from the ""grown-up"" menu - it's better tasting than off the kids' menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-short-hills?start=40,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.8640000000000003,3.2000000000000006

4,Kurtis P.,"Matawan, NJ",56,435,2.0,3.0,2013-03-25,"It's really sad when a place with the name ""Pizza"" in their title falls short on that one main dish. Their menu is packed full of many options and many sound great in theory, but the Pizza itself falls short and is really adequate at best. Luckily, their are other options on their menu and their salads really are the best choices. With many to choose from you can't go wrong there. CPK has that relaxed vibe, both in decor and atmosphere, and along with being BYOB it gives you more of a casual dining experience, especially for a mall. The service is alright and the prices are reasonable, but with many other dining options in the mall, I'd say you should really think twice.

Contemporary modern with booths and a few tables in the middle to squeeze extra seating out of their relatively small space. The only issue with this location (as noted in other reviews) is the high number of families with children that come here. During peak times it's almost always loud and noisy with babies screaming.  Service: Depends on the timing because, again it gets pretty crazy. Overall the servers know what they are doing. Ask for bread because they don't give it to you unless you do. It comes with herb olive oil that's pretty good. Food: Like I said, it's consistent. All their thin crust pies are crispy but chewy in texture without being too tough and I always get that crust if I'm getting pizza. That said, their salads are really good too.

Here is my story based what I believe to be factual events.    The Day was May 3, 2014, It was afternoon and my wife and I visited this location for some food.    Wife ordered pizza, which came out as expected.  I ordered pasta with meat sauce,  When it came out to me it looked fine, tasted fine, but as I kept eating, found a nice surprise that looked like spaghetti,  except it wasn't.  It was twine in my food. Yes Twine that appeared like spaghetti.   It was a good 7 inches long.  Think God I did not eat this, who knows what damage this could of caused me.  So I stopped eating and called manager over and showed him before is napped a picture.   First word out of his mouth,  ""Do you want my Job""?    I Don't get this comment one bit and I don't find this funny.   Regardless he apologized and tried to make it right, but I lost my appetite for that and since my wife was finished we just ordered keylime pie.  What I find interesting is you would of think that he would of just offered the meal on the house.  Nope,  He just said i'm going to get you another desert, even though we just had desert and refused his offer.  So he just offered his forced on desert and my meal which was contaminated on the house. I find this insulting and I should of just walked out right then and there, but my wife was 2 weeks from giving birth and didn't want to get her worked up.   I paid the bill in cash including a good tip and left.   It was at this point I felt I needed to go to corporate about this manager and service and hopefully they can make this right.   So I wrote to customer service about my experience.   I waited a week, finally a response guest relations (Leaving the personal information off but lets call her C.M.  She apologized and said they are investigating this matter and to expected a follow-up.  That was from 10/23/2014.   No follow-up, despite multiple responses back to that individual.      So here I am,  Disgusted at Short Hills Location, Disgusted at corporate even more for their lack of response.  Shame on you CPK.  Picture will be uploaded shortly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-short-hills?start=20,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.308,3.2000000000000006
73,Jillian J.,"Far Hills, NJ",0,30,2.0,1.0,2015-01-19,"So disgusted! January 9th 2015 went to order takeout at the bar! While waiting I watched the manager (FRANK) assist the cooks preparing the pizza across from me by sprinkling toppings on each pie (with glove on ONE HAND ONLY)! Even though the manager only had on one glove, he did seem to only touch the toppings with the glove. Was not so disgusted at this point! Was happy to see he was working UNTIL this manager and his glove went over to the registers, grabbed the DIRTY menus that the waiters took from the tables and took the menus, sorted/organized them and put them back at the hostess stand, where the hostess gives the menu back to the server to give to us. THEN he stepped outside into the mall and moved a couple baby carriages that were parked outside. On his way back to the kitchen, he pushed in a couple chairs and again fiddled with the register keys and straitened the menus that JUST arrived. He then headed back full circle to the pizza bar to help make pizzas!  I was still happy to see the manager working UNTIL I saw him start sprinkling toppings over the pizzas again with the same single filthy glove. He DID NOT CHANGE HIS GLOVE! What is dirtier than the menus, the chairs, the register keys AND baby strollers that moms have touched after changing their babies?????? I was so grossed out that he didn't change his glove (by the way only a glove on one hand), that I took a photo of him for corporate and walked out! Have not heard anything back from corporate!! I would never give this location a star but I had to give it something so you could see how they prepared your food! BEWARE UGH!!!!!

Had they told us it was going to be an hour we would have punted on CPK. But they either lied or just did not plan correctly. Either way, bad move.

68,Christina L.,"West Roxbury, MA",23,24,4.0,4.0,2015-02-08,"CPK is a great chain. I tried it first in Massachusetts with a lunch soup combo and a salted caramel pudding. So good. I had my first meal in Short hills with a group of ten who originally planned to eat at The Cheesecake Factory one Friday night, but were told it was a two hour wait (I had called ahead and tried to make a reservation for the ten of us. No go). California Pizza Kitchen told us it would be about half an hour. We waited maybe twenty minutes before they buzzed my phone that our table was ready. I had one of the light meals, the Shrimp Scampi Zucchini Fettuchine. Which was awesome. A smaller portion that filled me up, but still left room for some chocolates I got from our yankee swap after dinner. The only downside was they didn't serve any alcoholic beverages, but I was happy with a cranberry spritzer. Today I went back for lunch with my boyfriend and we got a plate of dumplings to share. I forgot how much they just taste like chicken and there is more wrapper than actual dumpling. The excess wrapper is also soft and mushy (in a good, dumpling-y sort of way) but it often felt like I was eating a jellyfish. The taste was good for a chicken dumpling, but there was a lot of sauce. For lunch, he ordered the Kung Pao spaghetti and really enjoyed it. Said it was spicy (but he likes spicy) and he couldn't eat the red chilies because they were hard. I ordered the California Club pizza. Ohhh mama, it was good. And I don't even like avocado all that much. The bacon was crunchy and perfect, the pizza itself was warm and an awesome contrast to the fresh tomato slices, greens and avocado on top. Those flavors were so good, I kind of wished it didn't have chicken on it because it didn't need it! I am so full right now, but I can't wait until later when I have the other half for dinner!

The food is always good but I can't have lunch without a glass of water at least. I was so disgusted when I saw the bartender refilling a customer's glass of water (into the customer's existing glass that she was drinking from) with the bar gun and the gun touches the content of the glass. For the love of God, please don't spread germs or bacteria and all those nasty stuff to the entire restaurants' patron. I wonder how many people will be drinking this woman's bacteria or virus that she might have in her mouth from her glass of water.  I think the bartender name was Alex. I literally stop drinking my soda as soon as I saw that. I was seated at the bar counter with my family and I saw the whole incident.  Also I saw the owner (Not 100% sure) fist bump 2 employees and tapped on an employee shoulder before he went into the open kitchen and start putting topping on the pizza and cutting them. The hygiene is so poor I don't know if I can come back to them again anymore. We are there at least once a month. For someone that lives 45 miles away from the mall - I considered myself a regular patron in this establishment.  Please pay attention to your employee.

Maybe I should start from the beginning. The wait was about an hour but that was okay because I understand that sometimes it gets a little busy. We sat down and it was a good table and our waiter was accommodating which is why I'm giving it 2 stars. Then we ordered two salads (which were great), something from the kids meal, and a Margherita pizza. We were waiting and waiting and waiting for SO LONG. until......... finally they brought out some bread. Usually you would think that they would bring out the bread earlier, but NOOOOOOOO. We got our food about two seconds after they brought out the bread.  When our waiter brought out the pizza I looked at it and gagged. It was so thin that I think some types of paper are ten times thicker. There was barely any sauce and the amount of oil that was on it made it so soggy and gross that all I could do was fold it 10 times over to eat it. My family had to use napkins to wipe off the excess lake of oil that was on the pizza.  After I ate my salad (btw the half is gigantic) I was just not okay with the pizza at all. I mean after all it is called California PIZZA kitchen. So I called the manager over and he was nice enough to take the pizza off of our check, so I thought that the experience was getting better. Until I decided to order dessert... BIG MISTAKE  For dessert we decided to order a chocolate soufflé while my younger brother got a brownie from the kids menu. When they brought the dessert over I almost laughed so hard because it was so horrendous that it was funny. My younger brother's brownie looked fine while my chocolate soufflé looked like it went through a hot summer day before it came to the table. There was no whipped cream on the brownie like there should've been and the soufflé was melting all over the place.  I usually have a good experience at CPK but this was total crap. I will not be recommending that anyone comes to the California pizza kitchen on a busy day and don't order the thin crust pizza unless you want to eat paper and are into that taste.

46,Erica S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",135,6,13.0,4.0,2017-03-07,"Visited this place around a months ago, the weekend before Valentines Day. It was pretty packed and we waited around 20 minutes for 2 people. **Originally I was going to give them 2 stars because of the lack of tidiness from the busboys but decided to give them 4 stars after seeing how serious they took our comments.**  Starting off with the positive: When seated, our lovely waitress made us feel very welcomed and did a thorough run through of their deals and specials. My boyfriend and I decided to go for the ""Sweet Deal for Two."" For starters, we got the spinach artichoke dip. I would say the dip was a bit on the saltier side for me, but it was very typical for a dip. For entrees, I got the Kung Pao Spaghetti with Chicken while my bf ordered their Original BBQ Chicken Pizza. I was actually quite taken back on how good the kung pao spaghetti was. Growing up with very Chinese parents, I have very high expectations when it comes to anything Chinese. The pizza was delicious and is very sizeable in terms of portion. We topped off the meal with Butter Cake, courtesy of our waitress recommendation. And gotta say, she was so right that the cake was so delicious that when finished, we were both left hanging for more! Some negative feedback:  As we were about to get served with our entrees, the family next to us paid their check and left. While the busboy was cleaning, I noticed the busboy used the exact same plates that were previously brought out with the dessert for the family next to us. To be quite frank, I was disgusted by the reaction since the plates were touched by the previous guests before but just not used. Knowing that sanitary and cleanliness are always a priority for restaurants, I called this out to our waitress who immediately agreed with us and removed the plates. She brought out fresh new ones and notified the restaurant manager asap. The restaurant manager even came to our table and address an apology for the busboy reaction and told us that the busboys were still pretty new and he will give them a talk.  Next, as we were eating dessert, my boyfriend noticed another busboy cleaning the other table that was next to us. To our bewilderment, the busboy didn't really wipe down the table and simply just dusted the crumbs onto the seat. My boyfriend brought this up again to our waitress and she again notified the manager, who took appropriate actions.  Honestly speaking, I do not think these should have happened in the first place, but being a big believer of second chances, I do hope the restaurant took steps to make these changes and address these sanitary issues to the bus boys.

The complimentary olive oil and bread was great with Italian herbs. We also ordered the crispy mac and cheese, which was delicious and surprisingly filling! My brother was most excited about the chipotle chicken pizza. The green sauce that it comes with on the side definitely brings the entire pizza together.  All in all, food was great, service was great, and we are definitely coming back soon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-short-hills,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004
37,Andrew L.,"Freehold, NJ",175,117,102.0,3.0,2017-09-23,"Took my girlfriend here for a quick bite and it was an average experience for us. The waitress was very friendly, but she was a bit slow on checking in with the customer. When we sat down, the waitress came up fairly quickly, greeted us, and asked for the drink.  After getting our drinks, she look a fairly long amount of time bringing us the drinks and bread. Afterwards, it was about 10-15mins and no one checked up on us to see if we wanted some more bread, but other tables were being frequently visited compared to ours. Now I'm not sure if it was our table's location, being at the back corner, we might have been easily forgotten about, but we definitely got checked on way less than other tables around us. Eventually our food came out. We got pizza and salad to share and honestly we loved the food. The food was great, definitely a place for a decent meal that's fairly priced. Would definitely come back. I'll give my benefit of the doubt and hope the waitress was just having an off day and our isolated location could've contributed to the lack of attention to our table. Anyways, clean, friendly, delicious, would come back again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-short-hills,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004
41,Ari M.,"Middletown, NJ",0,9,,2.0,2017-10-29,"2.5 at best. Was excited to try this place as I had never been. Just left with my gf and we are both disappointed at both the service and the food. We were given a table in the back that was dirty and the hostess removed the plates. We then waited while standing for 5 minutes for someone to wipe and set our table. This didn't happen until I went and told a passing waiter what we needed. The table was then quickly wiped and we were able to sit down, however with no menus. Our server finally came and gave us menus and our water. We ordered the avocado appetizer which was much smaller than we thought it would be. For main meals we had fish tacos and California club pizza. The fish seemed over cooked or just not fresh as it was chewy. The pizza felt like it just had arugula and some avocado and bacon dropped on it as there wasn't much chicken. We also never received nor were offered bread and oil as seems to be standard for the other tables in the restaurant. Overall disappointed with the cold/indifferent atmosphere, overall poor service, and lackluster food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-short-hills,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88
33,Khadija M.,"Bayonne, NJ",133,127,146.0,4.0,2017-11-11,"My first time at one of these chains a few nights ago. Im not a huge chain person but I am open to trying it . They were packed so my friend and I sat at the bar stools by the takeout area.  I got the buffalo cauliflower as my app and then the GF margarita pizza and my friend got the chips and guac and the chipotle chicken pizza.  The buffalo cauliflower- good! crispy, spicy. The chips and guac- not a great ratio.. needed more guac and the guac was different- chunks of avo, corn, beans. good though.  My GF pizza- BOMB af. I really loved it. It may have been the best gluten free pizza I've ever had, to be honest. The sauce was on point, the cheese was good quality, and the crust had a good crisp.  My friend liked his Pizza and it came with a really good sauce... a green cilantro sauce, yum!  The prices were a bit outrageous but that's expected of a high end (?) chain. Plus, we were in short hills mall. I would totally get pizza here again but wished there were more vegetarian options on the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-short-hills,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004
35,Sara H.,"Englewood, NJ",12,205,740.0,1.0,2017-11-13,"My husband and I stopped by for a quick bite on Veterans day, and unfortunately, we didn't have the most pleasant experience. My husband is an officer in the United States Army, and is currently stationed in Virginia. He visited me (NJ) during the veterans week and we decided to stop by CPK as we were told that the restaurants offers a special deal to the veterans.  Upon entrance, we were quickly seated into our table.  However, the moment we asked our server regarding the special offers for the veterans, the attitude of our server changed drastically. When our server brought us the special menu, I felt like he was throwing the menu at us. His attitude made it seemed like we weren't welcomed and made us feel pathetic for asking the offer.. Even after the foods were served, the server didn't check up with us even once..... I wanted to order drink, but I didn't even have a chance to order my coke as no one checked up with us. I got this impression of being mistreated because we asked for a veterans special menu. If it was the case, I think CPK shouldn't offer any deals to veterans period. However, if that wasn't the case, CPK just have a horrible customer service.  The food was decent, but the experience was just sad that I regret my visit on such special day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-short-hills,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004

I used to go almost twice-a-week, to have that salad!!  Anyhow, when I do go back I order the pot stickers, and Bianco pizza and it's always fine. Just not as special.
