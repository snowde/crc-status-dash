94,Food Junkie S.,"Chicago, IL",89,173,,4.0,2012-07-23,"I always felt CPK was a decent chain. In many ways, even better than Cheesecake, only because the waits are shorter and the food is always consistent. However, the service has always been a hit or miss. This time, the service was fantastic. My wife and I felt like we were at a fine dining establishment and not the CPK we know. Generally, the staff here is always slow and not very responsive until its time to pay. Glasses are always left empty and I can never seem to waive down my server, instead its always someone else's. Our server Max was phenomenal. Very attentive and the way he responded made you feel welcomed. Only if every establishment could train people to be more like Max from Rockford.

61,Michael S.,"Plainfield, IL",27,16,9.0,2.0,2013-07-09,"Meh. We've been to several CPK's throughout the area. This one ranks low. I don't know what it is about a lot of restaurants these days, but when the waiter/waitress finds out you're coming in for dessert, or a meal that isn't going to mean a huge, gigantic tip, they give up...and don't care. That's what happened to us. We were here on a Monday afternoon. It was busy, yes, but there were plenty of wait staff around. We weren't in the mood for pizza, as there are other menu items here that are also typically terrific. But as soon as our waiter found out we weren't ordering alcohol, and then when we placed our order for an appetizer to share and a large salad, a ""...hhmmmmph"" attitude ensued. Great way to keep happy customers coming back! (/sarcasm) Firstly, the sesame chicken dumplings are a rip off. It's like $7.99, and they give you...6? Maybe? So $8 bucks for so little food? Ugh.  The ""Italian Chopped Salad"" or whatever it's been changed to in the last year or so is also a huge disappointment. They added garbanzo beans (which they remembered to hold after we asked this time), made the portion smaller, and cut WAY BACK on the normally-awesome mustard/parmesan viniagarette. This is the 2nd or 3rd time now we've ordered this salad & could barely taste the dressing.  So lesson learned: don't go to CPK unless you plan on ordering food that's going to mean a large tip for the waiter/waitress. Possibly pass on some of the appetizers unless you're the type with money to burn; and if you're going to order their formerly-stellar chopped salad with that viniagarette to die for, ask for extra dressing on the side. Maybe it was just a bad day for our waiter; I dunno. It was a Monday, not a holiday, and the place was buzzing but not stressed. All I know this is the second time in a row we've gone to a CPK & have left unsatisfied and disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-skokie?start=60,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.568,3.2000000000000006

First of all we waited for a while before the waiter came to take off order.We asked for water and the manager had to go get it so that means the waiter forgot.

40,Lucas W.,"Wilmette, IL",23,332,,5.0,2014-01-02,"I've been coming to this CPK for over a decade now and in that time I think I've sampled basically their entire menu.  The food is absolutely delicious, always has been and always will be. There is such a wide variety of options to choose from that there's something for everyone and more than one pizza for everyone. I generally go with one of: Thai Chicken Pizza, BBQ Chicken Pizza, Chipotle Chicken Pizza or Carnitas Habanero Pizza. They're all fantastic with a lot of unique flavors. The atmosphere at this CPK is great, they used to be up on the second floor of the building next to their current one and that area with the massive mirrors and tall ceilings just felt rather stale so I was excited to see the new place which is very homey although maybe a bit dimly lit. The staff has always been attentive and responsive including honoring a few expired coupons. The only downside to CPK is the price, meals can get a bit expensive (solid $$, definitely not $$$). But I think of it this way, I get my pizza for roughly $14 (+tax/tip) but that gets me two meals so I'm paying only $7+change for two meals which is easily justifiable. Highly recommend CPK, enjoy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-skokie?start=40,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.804,3.2000000000000006

I love the atmosphere of the restaurant, our waiter was very excited to be working and very in tune with our requests. One of the people at our table did not even like a meal, but it was okay he sent it back to the kitchen and delivered them something else with no extra charge and no problems. I have to say one thing I was a bit disappointed with is portion size of the pizza. I ordered a wild mushroom pizza for about 12-13 dollars and I have to say they need to make that a bit bigger. I was not full afterwards but I loved the taste.

I am a fan of their whole menu--I'd recommend getting a pizza and appetizer to split for 2 people.  The pizzas are individual, but on the large size for that. They're working hard to please their clientele--the current menu has additions and subtractions from the past but you can see the effort at different crusts (very thin, thin and medium) and creative combinations.  I favor the Thai chicken, but I'd say there will be something you can find which pleases your taste ideas.

I don't mind going to chain restaurants sometimes, but I've always found the pizza to be on the doughy side, and we have better options closer to home. Yesterday I found myself at Old Orchard at lunchtime, and there was no wait. My friend and I both ordered half salads- she had a salad that came with peaches (canned), and I had a Chinese chicken salad. Her salad seemed to have fresher greens than mine, but the toppings were pretty lacking. My Chinese chicken salad was chopped, but it contained rotten greens. When I was clearly picking around them, the waiter asked if there was an issue. I pointed out the gross greens, and he told me that the dressing was just really dark ""if that made me feel better"". Um, no, it does not. I would expect him to check with the kitchen or offer me something else, but not to tell me that the item is fine the way it is.

I would definitely recommend it. It may be because I love sun dried tomatoes and pesto.. I also ordered the tiramisu for desert which looked gorgeous and tasted almost as good as it looked. My coworkers and I devoured that. Someone else ordered the chocolate cake which was too ""chocolate-y"" for me. A few of us also ordered drinks (martinis and mojitos), but it seems like they mixed the cups up because after getting second drinks, my coworker noticed that his drink tasted eerily similar to another.

I actually was looking forward to going to the Cheesecake Factory for dinner but I think it was prom night or something because there were a million teenagers in prom dresses waiting for tables there.. So my brother suggested California Pizza Kitchen. I think we waited about an hour and a half for a table for 12. I don't blame them though, we didn't have reservations, and we had a pretty big party. This was my first time at this restaurant and was surprised that they had a lot to offer on their menu. I ended up ordering everything on the appetizer list and loved it all! My favorite ones were the chips and spinach artichoke dip and the avocado egg rolls. The avocado egg rolls were the best I've ever had! I am a huge fan of chicken alfredo, I get it every time I go to any italian restaurant, so that's what I ordered here. They call it the Garlic Cream Fettuccine.  I ordered extra broccoli and portabello mushrooms with it. So, I was blown away when I tasted this dish! I almost never finish my meals at restaurants because I eat so much appetizers but I cleaned this plate off fast! This by far was the best Alfredo I've ever had in my life. Thinking about it makes me want to order it right now. My husband got the Hawaiian Pizza. Everyone else seemed pretty happy with everything they ordered. I can't say too much about how the pizza tasted because I didn't have any but my husband loved it. By the end of the night, they brought me out a huge ice cream sundae for my birthday with a candle. That sundae didn't have a chance. I inhaled it so fast.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-skokie?start=40,2.92,2.92,2.92,2.868,2.92

73,Karen M.,"Evanston, IL",0,18,,2.0,2015-04-26,"I keep giving my local CPK (at Old Orchard) a chance. I'm not sure why...  1. We almost left before ordering last night -- it was SOOOO noisy, with loud music blasting from the speaker above our heads. They blamed the kids but that wasn't the main problem. (I don't mind active kids, and having a restaurant blame the customers is not a good thing to do.) We were moved to another area of the restaurant. They eventually turned the volume down a bit (not enough but a bit), and the type of music changed and was MUCH better. In the first seating area the waiter couldn't even hear us and we couldn't hear him.  2. Even though the patio was not open (we ate inside), they have new furniture -- that is a GREAT improvement. The chairs they've had the past 2-3 years have been incredibly uncomfortable. The patio is one of the--perhaps the only--good part of this CPK. It is covered and so one can eat then in rainy weather. 3. I've been going to CPK since they opened in California -- they were great then. They have sold out. They now have another new menu, with a reduced selection of pizza, and many more that sounds like very traditional pizzas. Their whole ""reason to be"" seems gone. They haven't had the Tandoori Chicken Pizza for years -- it was my favorite. The Thai Chicken Pizza -- my other favorite -- now is rather tasteless and has almost no chicken. The peanut sauce is so sparce I could hardly taste it last night. And, there are too many bean sprouts and shredded carrots--both good to have, but not as the major part of the pizza. The original intention of CPK was to blend influences from different parts of the world. They seem to now be a sausage, pepperoni pizza place. I don't need to go there to spend double or triple for what I can get elsewhere. I'm disappointed in the ""new"" CPK menu choices. (I do like the Moroccan salad, which I got last week from another CPK--it now has more lettuce than in the past which I don't appreciate--the seem to give more cheap ingredients and less of the real substance of their dishes. It used to be mostly vegetables; not it is mostly lettuce.)  4.

My friends and I have a set routine when we visit any CPK, which is centered around us trying to decide between our individual go-to dishes.  I was all set for the big debate: chicken lettuce wraps or avocado chicken club egg rolls? Carnitas tacos? California club sandwich or the grilled chicken Caesar sandwich with the Sedona tortilla soup? Well, along with the interior, it seems the menu was also revamped. Three of my 5 favorite things to order are no longer options. The sandwiches can only be ordered from 11-4 during the ""lunch"" hours and even then, you only have the option of ordering a half sandwich. This is a farce. It made my ordering process a heck of a lot easier but I already went through the coping period of when CPK switched the kind of bread they used for their sandwiches and now I have to deal with having to make sure I arrive at a specific time and can only order half of what I'm crazily craving!?  Don't get me wrong, the food is delicious and I'm not about to deprive myself from the glory of dining at CPK, I just wish I could keep my options open (also they raised small plate prices..

39,Judy E.,"Chicago, IL",0,20,3.0,2.0,2015-06-06,"Visiting a friend who just moved across the street from Old Orchard, she suggested I bring California Pizza Kitchen Thai Chicken pizza. We had been big fans years ago when CPK opened on Orleans St. in Chicago, often going several times a month. I hadn't had anything but the frozen, grocery store CPK pizza for many, many years so I was excited to have the real thing again. Entering the restaurant I immediately noticed the visible grease and dirt covering the menus at the hostess stand, but I ignored it and stepped inside to a dark restaurant whose only lights were from the take-out sign and the kitchen. It was gorgeous and sunny outside, but there was no sunlight filtering through the windows, and it gave a sense of dinginess rather than the typical darker ambiance of a restaurant. I knew what I wanted and was grateful I didn't have to touch the menu laid out on the take-out counter, and the staff was fast, friendly, and efficient and I had my order to go in less than 10 minutes.    Another 10 minutes and I was sitting down to eat in my friend's kitchen, disappointed to see that the julienne veggies were just piled on top, not cooked into the pizza. And when I picked up a slice they fell off - not a few, nearly all of them. Perhaps it is unfair to compare today's pizza with its predecessor, but I was very disappointed. From the loose raw veggies that never touched the peanut sauce to the crust that tasted like the freezer version, there was nothing there to make a happy memory.  Given the dirt, dark, and lackluster pizza, I would not recommend this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-skokie?start=20,2.64,2.64,2.64,2.9520000000000004,2.64

Service was great though our waitress Gabby was tv advertisement friendly, meaning she was very nice girl.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-skokie,3.44,3.44,3.44,,3.4400000000000004
25,Danny I.,"Chicago, IL",0,1,1.0,1.0,2017-04-02,"On a bright sunny day, a friend and I decided to stop by at California pizza for a delicious meal; after all, my deceased grandmother absolutely loved this place. As we walked into the restaurant, we were treated by a nice hostess. She told us we had to wait 20 minutes just so we could have our table. I looked around the restaurant and saw that there were empty tables at every corner. Though, I didn't mind waiting. I proceeded to ask the lady about the bottles on the wall behind her which caught my eye. She laughed in my face and told me that they're actually fake to make the restaurant look more expensive, otherwise they wouldn't be able to charge $16 for a Sicilian. After that I sat down in the waiting room and was pleasantly greeted by a few of thousands of screeching children running around here like its Chuckie cheese on a Saturday afternoon. They began their demonic chanting which took part of my soul it wasn't till I was nearly passed out from this that I was able to gather the strength of a thousand Rubens and kick these satan children away from me. Once we finally got our table, we waited another 20 minutes to be greeted by our waiter. He started us off with two cups of toilet bowl water mixed with tap water to even our the acidity. We were then treated to a nice plate of bread and oil which looks like it came out of my car's engine after ten thousand miles. I couldn't help but notice the low hanging lights with the dimmest lighting I've ever seen in my life.  If the lights were fluorescent they would not have to be dangling it is a true shame. We were brought bread crumbs and never served real food. Overall 5/7",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-skokie?start=20,3.4,3.4,3.4,,3.4000000000000004

The weather was really nice outside so the outdoor seating was full, but indoor seating was readily available. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive; she came to check up on us often to make sure the food was good and our water glasses were filled.  We ordered the spinach artichoke dip as an appetizer. Then we got the wild mushroom strozzapreti and wild mushroom pizza with truffle oil. Compared to other places we've been to, I wouldn't say the spinach artichoke dip was anything special. The pasta and pizza were delicious though, and I definitely recommend those.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-skokie,3.36,3.36,3.36,,3.3600000000000003

It was a little loud at times but when you have a busy restaurant that's going to happen. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. I had the garlic pasta with chicken, which for a garlic lover like me hit the mark. My husband had the bbq chicken pizza and let me have a slice, it to was delicious. I was also happy to see they have one of my favorite kinds of wine. here. The prices were very reasonable to, all things considered.

This isn't your regular pizza chain. Best thing is you have many different options to choose from!  I'm not a big fan of deep dish pizza because after you have one slice you can't eat anymore. Thin crust is best so you can savor every bite.  They've got BBQ chicken pizza, Thai chicken pizza, Hawaiin pizza, Spicy Chipotle and many more fun pizzas to try. I just wish they can give me a slice of each pizza they have to offer. Just so I'll know which one I'd fall in love with the most.  And they're all baked in a brick oven with blazing fire before your very eyes.  I really liked the sauce they use for the wild mushroom strozzapreti, very flavorful.  The bread they serve beforehand with the olive oil is nicely baked! Yum!  I've also tried their super spinach and quinoa salad, very different, love it! And their salted caramel pudding for dessert which definitely amazed me ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-skokie,3.6,3.1,3.1,,3.3000000000000007
2,Jennifer P.,"Chicago, IL",204,277,466.0,3.0,2017-05-21,"With mixed feelings all around, I finally got the chance to dine in at California Pizza Kitchen. The reps that come to my work would bring us this amazing chopped salad and sandwiches. That generosity has since fallen off, but what I had got me curious to sample more of the menu. On this visit I had the pesto cream penne with shrimp.   Overall the service was courteous and my food was just okay. I wanted more shrimp and the pesto sauce itself fell flat. I think it needed more salt or olive oil. Maybe they shouldn't do whatever they do in order to call the dish ""creamy."" Do I want to know what they use to make it creamy. I don't know.  All I know is that I love their salads and sandwiches. If I worked closer to this restaurant, I'd probably become a regular. I've noticed that this location gets packed in the afternoon. I did get some leers from the wait staff for choosing to linger in my large booth after finishing my average pasta dish. I had some time to kill between running errands and before my shift at work. Needless to say, when I got up to finally leave, the entire staff at the front entrance was staring at me like they had been staring for awhile. It was amusing. They all seemed to smile at the same time, saying their good byes, secretly wishing they could have followed that up with, ""Don't let the door hit you in the caboose!""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-skokie,3.56,3.12,3.12,,3.2960000000000007

I came with a coworker for lunch one afternoon and the food was pretty delicious! I'd equate it to the same quality as the Cheesecake Factory next door but a more limited menu. Price point seems about the same to me (perhaps a dollar or two cheaper).  Their complimentary bread and herb olive oil was so good - better than the bread and butter offering at most other restaurants! I ordered the tequila chicken pasta (tastyyyy!) and got their corn advocado guac app ($5 for a small portion). The app was unique but not something I'd order again - I'm glad that it was a small serving compared to other apps that seem to tip more towards the $10 mark these days. My pasta was made well and was a very healthy serving for the price. I left completely satisfied and was very happy with the service and quality of food! My coworker got the 1/2 salad which was a very generous serving as well! Definitely will be coming back for more!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-skokie,3.56,3.15,3.15,,3.314
26,Karen W.,"Chicago, IL",0,7,,1.0,2017-06-22,The take-out service is consistently sub par.  You must go through your order and open the dishes to see if they are correct before you go home.  There are too many times that I can count when the order is wrong when I get home.  I enjoy their salads but will take a break from this restaurant because they just can't get it right.  Apologies don't help when you are home and the order is wrong.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-skokie?start=20,3.4,3.12,3.12,,3.2320000000000007

Me and my daughter which is 14 mo (she was in a light umbrella stroller) and my friend, her son which is 6 years old and her 1 mo newborn daughter (which was in an infant car seat) wanted to have dinner here at 5pm today (Friday). The place was almost empty (2 occupied tables inside and maybe 2 outside on the patio). The girl at the entrance tried to tell us in different ways that we are not welcome to dine here. First she said that we could only be out on the patio which is exactly what we wanted, than she said that they can only sit 4 persons at a table.    We did not get it ... we were 2 adults, 2 kids and one newborn ... I guess because of the 5th person which is 1mo old in an infant car seat made it impossible for us. Than she said we could not get in with the strollers bla bla bla. She called the manager which started with the same story, so we lost it and just turned around and leave saying that we didn't know that families with kids are not welcome.

Also, their bread was delicious! It was such a treat to do curbside carry out. Recently they removed the pizza I loved from the menu, and stopped providing the bread. I'm guessing the bread was a cost saving measure? They raised the pizza prices and took away bread. I've been back twice and tried 2 different pizzas, both were very mediocre. The only redeeming thing is they have some really great ranch dressing, but it's not enough to come back for.

I asked for some more chicken which they gladly brought but it was pretty bland overall with little flavor and I found 1 piece of roasted garlic. Service was pretty good and I must say the artichoke dip was really awesome but the tortilla spring rolls were way overpriced for the amount, for love of God one roll with a 1/2 small scoop of quacamole was  $4,30 NOOOOO.  Also nothing to do with CPK because I think the manager tried to ameliorate the problem which was a screaming child whose parents appeared to make NO attempt to stop the horrible noise. I do not appreciate going out to dinner and having my ears assailed by the eardrum splitting screams of uncontrolled children. We used to take our gilrs out a lot and when they even once started making noise either my husband or I would scoop them up and take them outside or to the car if necessary and I can tell you it only took a few times of this before they never ever repeated the behaviour. People with children need to get this and GET the heck out so as not to torture others with their poorly socialized chidren",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-skokie,3.44,3.11,3.11,,3.242
