97,Michele B.,"La Mesa, CA",20,9,1.0,1.0,2012-02-29,"No Happy Hour. No French Fries! Okay, I admit... I am not prone to writing reviews. But this place nerved me so here goes. I stopped by after work thinking I'd have a nice Hop Head Red that they once had on tap over the summer. No such luck. Okay, I'm flexible. But also no Happy Hour Specials? At all?  Okay, fine....with all the little kids in the place - I can see it. I had the caramelized peach salad with chicken which was pretty okay. The chicken was nicely grilled, hot, moist, tender - the salad was served with a nice white balsamic vinaigrette. Only one piece of undesirable greens - I can live with it. The side of bread was really unmentionable - cold and tasteless. But free, so... I asked for a side of French Fries and was told they don't have French Fries. Really? With all the little kids in this place? And no happy hour ...

83,Jeff J.,"West New York, NJ",4,41,,3.0,2012-09-04,"Notable stars sprinkled throughout this menu. After moving to the east coast, there's not much that stands out about the pizza from this place. Then again, there's a couple things I'll admit I miss a little bit. The BBQ chicken pizza was always a big hit with me. It's sweet, tangy and a real good pizza.  Growing up, this was always the place my mom wanted to go for her birthday. At night, it gets crowded, so try to make a reservation. She raved about their salads. Since I haven't tried one, I can't give any other insight into it.  What stood out to me was their chicken caesar sandwiches served on herb cheese focaccia bread. Note to self: I got to find out how to make this bread. Anyways, it's served with a cup of soup on the side; they used to offer this awesome one, the adobe chicken chowder -- a tad of spice, not too much chicken and some crispy tortilla chip strips laid on top added a nice crunch to it. My school was close to this place, so for lunches, we often ordered it to go. It became the usual go to place for a quick pick up and affordable, yet delicious, lunch. This brings me to my next point. My favorite part about CPK: roadside service. Simply pull up to the tent marked as such, and that's it. Let the waiter/waitress come to you. It's easy, convenient and best of all, fast. No waiting for a table. Only friendly, curbside pick up. If only everything was this easy. Just remember, try to leave a small tip. These waiters/waitresses/curbside hosts/hostesses need some lovin' too.  I'm proud to say to my east coast friends that I'll be back when I'm in the area. Probably just to pick up a chicken caesar sandwich on that focaccia bread.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-solana-beach?start=80,3.24,3.24,3.24,2.54,3.2400000000000007

85,Alain G.,"Encinitas, CA",3,29,,2.0,2012-12-01,"I kind of wish I could enjoy California Pizza Kitchen (CPK) more than I really do.  Because there are just so many good things about this restaurant!  However, every time I go I just end up thinking ""meh."" Let's start with the pros.  The food isn't bad.  The menu is a nice mix between standard pepperoni pizza choices and slightly more adventurous Gorgonzola/pine nut/pear pizza options.  I like adventurous pizza so this aspect to the restaurant appeals to me.  CPK is also a chain located in several areas around San Diego including Solana Beach, La Jolla and downtown San Diego area (off Friars Road).  These locations make it a reliable, convenient choice.  I've never had to wait longer than 20 minutes at any location.  So if you're starving, it's the kind of place you know you could get into on a Friday/Saturday night in areas of San Diego that normally tend to be more crowded. The cons?  While the food isn't bad, it's not great either.  Nothing I've had at CPK has been especially memorable.  I don't mind eating the food but there's really nothing ""signature"" about a CPK pizza.  I would just as soon get a pizza from any other place. However, I will admit that CPK is a great place to take kids.  It's definitely a step up from Pizza Hut but still has the kind of things that kids like to eat.  So as a family outing it's a good option.  As a going out on the town with your date option?  Meh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-solana-beach?start=80,3.08,3.08,3.08,2.472,3.0800000000000005
102,Roslyn B.,"San Diego, CA",0,15,,1.0,2013-02-06,"Words cannot describe how utterly horrific it is to make a togo order from this place. They have some train wreck of a call center in Colorado that takes your order, then sends it to your specific location. That is, if you can understand to which location they are referring and if your order will ever make it to the one that you ""called"". The operators call Solana Beach by the name of the shopping center (did anyone know that center even had a name??) and pronounce La Jolla ""luh jawla"". And that's honestly just irritating; the truly bad part is that they ALWAYS MESS UP YOUR ORDER: I ask to substitute shrimp, I end up with chicken still tossed into my salad and a side of hot shrimp. I ask for bread, nope, no bread. When every single person insists dressing comes one the side, the one time I finally stop requesting dressing on the side, my salad comes drenched. The other part of the call center that drives me insane is how many times the call has cut out in the middle of ordering. You then have to call back, hope you remember the person's name, and try to confirm that your order made it to the restaurant and wasn't lost somewhere over the rockies. Then, to top it all off, they try to upsell you some ""delicious slice of key lime pie"" or an ""iced cold beverage' its like no, thanks, if I wanted that I'd order it, please just listen to what I DO want and maybe you'll get it right for once. Either every single person in that call center has had a lobotomy or is enjoying Colorado's newly passed marijuana laws a little too much because I have yet to come across one who is competent. Bottom line: wish I could count how many times I've just gone home to eat frozen deli-mex taquitos from 1998 over having to deal with CPK's togo issues. The service inside is equally as bad so dining in isn't exactly a viable option either. I wish I didn't love those few menu items and the bread as much as I do because i would honestly never even look at the place ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-solana-beach?start=100,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.468,3.0000000000000004

92,Dan H.,"Carlsbad, CA",283,37,4.0,1.0,2013-12-05,"Oh man where do I start.... when we walked in the hostess was very friendly and helped our rather large group find a table pretty quickly. We had been on our weekend Harley ride all day and stopped in a quick bite for dinner. Once seated at our table we waited about 20 mins for the waiter to come over and greet us. Once he did he was really blunt and stuck up. He was a Mexican guy and a few of us in the group Spanish is our first language meaning we are more comfortable speaking that language. One of our party started ordering in Spanish and he stopped her in the middle of her drink order and told her in his broken English "" I espeaka english, OK!"" little rude fuck!! She looked at us like I cant believe he just said that. She then continued in English for this guy. We all ordered drinks and the guy disappeared for another 20 mins. Finally the manager came over to check on us, then our drinks appeared. We made sure to order while we had the guy there. He was supper annoyed by us and his attitude sure as hell showed it. The manager came over and was checking on us while this guy was MIA our food finally showed up. I ordered the Hawaiian pizza and it was very dry even at the point of starving the food was just ""OK"". We ate our food and the only time this guy was on it was when he brought the check. I paid $40 for a salad and a 10"" pizza that taste like bread with melted cheese with dried out ham and dehydrated pineapple on it.  I think this guy needs a job somewhere behind the scenes and not dealing with customers I am not saying fire him but put him somewhere else. I will not be going back to this place, I have received better service at a dine in pizza hut where they don't expect tips.

The pizza was on a very thin but edible crust that did not taste rice floury - like some of gf stuff does. However, the crust does come out of the fridge / freezer so is not that fresh - from what I can tell. Everything else was pretty standard toppings. I felt it was really nice to have the option and CPK has definitely trained their employees on how to avoid cross contamination (new gloves, own baking dish, different prep area), but in the end Udis frozen is pretty much the same thing and about $4 cheaper.

54,Valerie P.,"Boise, ID",2,13,,1.0,2014-08-16,"If I was writing this review a year ago, it would have been four stars. Today, I feel that giving one start is generous. Read on to hear me out.  I've never had such a terrible experience at a restaurant. My boyfriend and I ended up spending our entire Friday night date talking about writing this yelp review to warn others in the community.  First complaint: Waitstaff  We were greeted by 5 people hanging out at the host stand-excessive and overwhelming when you walk in. Two different hosts put their fingers on our plates before they set them in front of us...  If you haven't been recently, they've renovated and changed their menu. The new furniture is a bunch of cheap decor trying to be modern but ended up being inconvenient- our table was uneven and the coasters too thin to slip under the table legs. In fact, the coasters were so thin, they didn't even absorb the condensation from our glasses. Yet again giving off a cheap vibe.  Our waitress asked us if we wanted another entree when she came to take our entree plate... I've never heard of that before. Who goes and buys two rounds of entrees? Wouldn't you just order them at the same time? She complained to us that another server took our drink orders before she could get to our table, unprofessional. Later  our waitress was audibly arguing with other waitstaff before bringing our check.. unprofessional.  Not to mention, while sitting on the patio two children were running around and yelling without their shoes off trying to touch the fire in the heaters. Unique to our experience, but added to our frustration.  Second major complaint: Food & Drinks Our drinks were severely watered down and overpriced for sure... who orders a margarita and doesn't even feel it?!  A little picky in some points in my review? probably. The whole time my boyfriend kept saying, at least the food tastes good! At least our meal is good.  But here's the kicker..... My boyfriend got food poisoning from his sausage, mushroom, and pepperoni pizza.  It had to be that because we ate all of the same food all day leading up to the entree!  CPK used to be great!

By this point we were very frustrated as we had been waiting for an HOUR AND A HALF just for our pizza.

There are now a lot of non-pizza options, which is great because I've never been super impressed by their pizza. I decided to try the Pesto Cream Penne with Chicken and actually found the dish to be very good. The sauce was amazing and there was plenty of sundried tomatoes to add extra flavor. The portion size proved to be plenty for two meals for me. Unfortunately, my man didn't care for his Tostada Thin Crust pizza at all. Although it's topped with black beans and cheese, the lettuce seemed to overwhelm the pizza. The tiny bit of ranch drizzle and the side of salsa didn't add enough moisture to overcome the lack of a sauce. He thought that each slice made a better taco than a pizza. We also had some trouble communicating with our waitress. We signed up for the Pizza Dough while we were at the table and tried to get her to add the points to our card but we don't think that it happened. She tried to tell us that she already added it but we hadn't given her the number yet. We eventually just gave up. On the plus side though, you get a free small plate for signing up and we were able to redeem that. We chose the White Corn Guacamole and Chips and thought that it was pretty good.

17,Drew L.,"San Diego, CA",301,280,432.0,2.0,2015-05-09,"Prelims: the interior looks like every other CPK in the world, with a bar, some booth seating, some regular seating, and a full view of the pizza making process. I went at lunch time on a Saturday so I didn't get the lunch deal of half pizza and salad. The lighting is pretty good, it's spacious, and it's located in a plaza with plenty of parking. But I came on a Saturday so take it with a grain of salt, although it is Solana Beach so maybe parking is never an issue.  I set aside a specific paragraph for the service. Normally I couldn't give a rat's behind about service because I come to restaurant to eat food, not to be served. As a former worker in the service industry, I know and understand that service is oftentimes very dependent on other customers, the kitchen, and a lot of other things outside of a server's control and they shouldn't be penalized on the tip just because they are the face of the disaster that's slowly detonating behind them. But in this case, I am fuming over the way that I was treated at this location. I came as a single. Yes, the fiancee was sleeping after work - I'm a sad, sad little man. I came after playing ball for 2 hours and then having a light workout at the Fit Athletic Club next door (SHOUT OUT TO TRISH FOR THE YELP FIT EVENT! YOU'RE AWESOME!!!) so I was understandably starving for some sort of protein. Hell, for any sort of food. But as a single, I don't really represent a lot in terms of tip. So if I'm a little lower on the priority list, fine. Whatever. I was seated at a booth and it takes 15 minutes for the server to come and tell me that she would be ""right with me"". 10 minutes later, water. ""Right with me""...right.... So after 25 minutes, I finally get to order. I order the Works pizza. 8 minutes later, she comes and offers me bread. I refuse out of principle that this is taking forever and the fact that I need to watch my figure. It takes another 18 minutes for the food to get to me. So a starving single man needs to wait 40 minutes to get his food - while the mom and daughter sitting behind me gets seated 10 minutes after me, gets orders in within 5 minutes, and gets their food, all before I even order. They finished eating when I GOT my food and left while I was eating. Are you kidding me? While the server makes apologies, in this case, all apologies are excuses.  The food was standard. The works pizza is with sausage, bell pepper, red onion, and oregano. It was ok. But the food was totally spoiled because I was sitting there playing with my phone for a solid 40 minutes. I left after one hour; 15 minutes to eat. One hour for a single person to sit, order and eat. Objectively, the food was standard; it tasted like a pizza and I only ate half because I was past the point of hungry and I saved the rest. If you are desperate for pizza in this area, I would recommend putting your craving off and eating at Rubio's next door. Better food, better service. I regret putting down $18 (yes, I still tipped. You should too) for a substandard lunch. If I'm not worth your time, serve me faster so that other customers get my table. Whatever. Lesson is seriously learned.    TL;DR Don't come alone or they treat you like you are not worth their time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-solana-beach?start=20,3.28,3.28,3.28,3.3040000000000003,3.2800000000000002

I was pretty hungry so this was quite frustrating. She asked if we wanted bread, in which case of course I said yes being the starch-freak that I am. Bread was brought out promptly and devoured fast. I always love the bread and olive oil combo at CPK - it's one of my favorites. We eventually received our food (not from our server) and were asked if we needed anything else (pepper for the salad, etc). I tried a few slices of the Roasted Garlic Chicken my friend ordered and thought it was excellent! I hadn't tried this particular pizza yet, so I may go ahead and order it again the next time I find myself at CPK. As for my Caesar Salad, I think the quality and taste of their Caesar's have gone down in the past few years. It didn't taste as good as it used to. In fact, as mentioned in a previous CPK review at a different location, it seems like their food and portion sizes have gone down indefinitely. For some reason (maybe because I love pizza), I still find myself coming back even with these negative changes - haha.  All in all, this location's layout is unique (as I find most CPK locations to be), but I think I'd try something different if I'm in this area again. CPK used to be one of my favorites, but now I've gotten tired of it and am disappointed in the changes. It's more expensive now as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-solana-beach,3.92,3.92,3.92,3.2440000000000007,3.92

We ordered : THE ORIGINAL BBQ CHICKEN CHOPPED SALAD Black beans, sweet corn, jicama, fresh cilantro & basil, crispy corn tortilla strips, Monterey Jack and our housemade herb ranch. Topped with BBQ chicken, tomatoes and scallions plus Avocado. Half-order - $14.69 The salads were split for both of us without asking as we had indicated to our server that we would share the salad.   This was a nice touch.  The salad was fresh and crisp. The salad plates were chilled.  The salads ingredients were fresh and although I would have preferred more sweet corn, the blend of housemade herb ranch was perfect.

16,Bijan A.,"Encinitas, CA",1,1,,1.0,2017-03-29,"Me and my Mother, both of whom have good palettes and can actually cook, anonymously agreed that while the service was adequate, the food not only lacked in substantial taste but also size portions. While this review can only be limited to the dishes we tried, (and probably the last we will ever try) which were the Salmon in the main dishes section of the menu, and the Hawaiian Pizza (a personal favorite of mine); we were underwhelmed by the severe lack of seasoning on the salmon, and portion size for a whopping $20; and the lack of flavor and blandness on the pizza which costed us $14, which tasted similar to, if not worse than a store bought pizza for 5 dollars.  The evening out which I anticipated to be at-least somewhat decent since I'd seen the place had been renovated and items where priced higher around the $15-25 range, unfortunately turned sour quickly. When we got there, we were shown good customer service. We took a while to order since everything was priced so high and even asked how large the portion sizes were and were told we would be adequately fed, so I anticipated no predicaments in relation to being fed enough. While we decided we were given delicious fresh baked rosemary bread with an olive oil basil dip (which I thought was a little too oily and could've used some balsamic vinaigrette). But after we ordered the salmon and the Hawaiian Pizza and got them we noticed a multitude of unacceptable problems that paying $34 for two people is not what you'd expect for the food to have. First, the Salmon, seasoned with paprika and butter (which for the record is NOT what you season salmon with, I haven't a clue what they were thinking when they thought that would taste good). Butter is just more fat, something that drowns out the tender flavor of salmon and offers an oil that fish doesn't need. And paprika which is primarily used to give food an orange hue, doesn't offer any saltiness or spice or sourness that makes fish so delicious, it's just food coloring to pretend something has flavor. The Salmon was a completely bland, narrow strip no more than a few inches longer than my pointer finger and index finger stretched out together, with tasteless broccoli which I asked in place of the white corn which would've undoubtedly have been worse. Granted me and my mother split the Salmon dish and the 11' Hawaiian pizza but even after both we felt underfed. And I am by no means a heavy eater, or fat for that matter. And when we talked to the manager working there, complaining about the lack of flavor, and how we payed $20 for tasteless crap she dismissed us by saying, ""It's part of what we do, to add little seasoning so the customer can add their own salt and pepper."" I was infuriated talking with mom about how, ""If you pay $20 for Salmon you're expecting it to have it's own unique flavor to it, you're expecting something to be cooked with perfect seasoning before you cook it in a correct portion size, not the customer literally adding salt and pepper from the table onto it to give it flavor and having the salt and pepper roll off the top cuz the Salmon is already cooked and none of those flavors were cooked into the salmon."" If it had been cooked onto the salmon with a little lime juice it would've made it much more delicious. It's ridiculous, when you go out to eat, you the customer, especially if you're paying $20 for Salmon, are expecting well prepared food better than you could cook on your own at home. That's part of the whole premise of eating out, taking a break from cooking yourself, and eating good food, and I can honestly tell you, that is miles away from the experience I had. Moving on to the Hawaiian Pizza, like I stated before, for $14 I could gone to Blaze's pizza and gotten nearly two build your owns, choosing each and every flavor I'd want, to make it far more delicious than what we were served. Similarly you could go to Round Table Pizza and get a $14 with a uniquely designed pizza with a hundred more toppings than the mediocre pizza we got that was no better than a store bought basic pizza. After being completely dissatisfied and being told straight up, ""We are the only ones they've heard that have complained about their food,"" we told them every aspect of our dissatisfaction, and the manager feeling sorry, said she would give us a free desert. The desert I had was a cake with basic vanilla ice cream on top, and, NO Joke literally whipped cream from a spray can...I mean come on, I can spray cream onto a loaf cake I buy from a store for $2 and stick a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top and charge someone close to $10 dollars, I mean it was free for us, but for the poor sucker paying $10 for something with such a little amount of complexity to it is laughable.  I would never recommend to anyone, going to California Pizza Kitchen, there are MUCH BETTER ways to spend $20 on Salmon or $14 on pizza. I regret ever coming here and it was a complete waste of money. Don't buy into their scam!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-solana-beach?start=20,3.68,3.36,3.36,,3.4880000000000004
