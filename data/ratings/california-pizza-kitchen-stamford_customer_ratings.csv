27,Roy K.,"Stamford, CT",1,3,,4.0,2012-05-14,"I don't review much but after looking at all the negative reviews, I had to put in a positive one to balance things out. I suspect that people often put in bad reviews when it's a chain restaurant. But if one can put that fact aside for a moment and focus only on the pizza, I think CPK in Stamford offers a good alternative to Colony or Coal House or Outpost when you are in the mood for a slightly different pizza. Bear in mind, I do know how to enjoy good ""standard"" pizza, and there is no comparing CPK to Pepe's in NH, Lombardi's in Soho, Grimaldi's in Brooklyn, Patsy's in midtown, and Jonh's in the West Village. However, CPK definitely offers a different kind of pizza, and the crust is surprisingly chewy and good and the toppings very unique. Our favorite choices are the Greek Salad pizza, and the Carne Asada pizza which they may not have on their menu anymore. The place being family friendly is a plus too if you have kids, and the restaurant is very spacious and inviting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-stamford?start=60,2.768,2.768,2.768,2.768,2.768

It was my first time here and being a new stamford resident, i was ready to explore my new neighborhood's various restaurants.. Long story short, the food was pretty good but i'm giving 5 stars for the service we got. It was a busy friday night and they ran out of some ingredient and had us waiting for a lot longer than usual. The long wait was compensated with a pizza and soup and on the house by the kind manager!

What really offends me was the pizza. It's hard to think they make the pizza fresh when my sausage, mushroom and pepperoni felt like it was frozen and slapped in the microwave.

12,Rachel A.,"Norwalk, CT",1,22,7.0,5.0,2013-10-01,"This is a review for the new gluten free pizza.  If you are gluten-intolerant in the Fairfield County area and you are missing pizza, and you just aren't in the mood for Fat Cat, THEN GO HERE.  I got their gluten-free BBQ chicken pizza. First of all: it's actually, like, the size of a pizza. I had to take home two slices, and I'm still stuffed hours later. This pizza is on POINT. The crust, which is made in house (it's not that icky Still Riding frozen business!), is thin, crispy (crust was crunchy, if that's not your thing then I'm sorry), chewy and awesome. Let me repeat that: the crust, which is gluten-free, is MADE IN HOUSE. Toppings were great, very flavorful. They have certifications from GIG (Gluten Intolerance Group) for safe, non-cross-contamination kitchen practices, and boy, did it show. Not only did my pizza come with a little plastic flag that said ""gluten free"" on it, but my server actually had to ask me to box up my own slices. Why? Because he may well have handled something glutenous at his other tables and didn't want to risk contaminating mine! Apparently this is company policy, as his manager advised him to do it. Super awesome policy!  The only complaint I've got is that it's pricy at 15.25 a pie, but I could have very easily split one pizza and a small salad with a dining companion, and gotten out with a full meal for two for under 30 bucks. They also have gluten-free stuff on their non-pizza menu (I spotted a caramelized peach salad that was GF and seemed like it would be delicious!). Excited to bring my Celiac'd SO here sometime soon for date night! We'll be back, definitely.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-stamford?start=40,2.76,2.76,2.76,2.836,2.76

I got a chips and guacamole appetizer and then the Thai Chicken Pizza.

That's some bullshit right there. Ok- so ordered one of their signature drinks and it was very good. Except a server was yelling behind my back to tell someone in the kitchen to clean the outside tables. Ugh. Why hasn't this girl been trained not to yell over patron's heads? I then had one if my rave faves at this chain- the California  Cobb salad- delish. Except the bar reeked of garbage- it clearly hadn't been emptied. The bartender told me it's emptied every night. Yup- I'm sure it is. But when I can smell rotting garbage at 2:00 in the afternoon they probably need to empty it more often right? Or scrub the bins. Or something. Because ewwwww... So the bartender is a sweet girl but untrained- I had to pour my own beer into the glass with no napkin or coaster.

All in all the service and condition of the restaurant was inexcusable as it was not busy at all, floor was dirty, tables had to go coffee cups on them throughout their dining room and the bar had scattered menus and more to go coffee cups laying around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-stamford,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68

33,Meenah A.,"Lancaster, CA",0,3,1.0,1.0,2017-03-25,"Came here on a vacation from California, and I was quick to realize why you should never dine at a CPK outside of California--service was HORRIBLE. My party of 4 arrived at 5:35 and we were seated promptly. Our order was also taken quickly, but that was the extent of our decent experience. 3 lemonades and a water, which took almost 20 minutes to arrive. Got our food at around 6:05, and 3 of us finished our food at 6:15. The waiter finally arrived back to collect our dishes (we hoped that he would refill the water too, but that didn't happen), and he quickly grabbed the 3 empty dishes and STACKED THEM in my 4th friend's plate of food that she was STILL EATING. He did not care to ask if she was finished, he just took our empty dishes and put them in her food, forcing her to be finished too. Rude and unnecessary. We asked for dessert menus (still with empty water cups) and he dropped them on our table without even stopping. He then took almost 15 minutes to come back and take our dessert orders, while we watched him serve other tables and make drinks for other customers who had arrived after us. Our dessert (chocolate cake and ice cream sundaes) were ordered at around 6:30, and did not arrive until nearly 6:50. When they came out, the ice cream was melted and the ""warm chocolate cake"" was cold. We asked for the check and set up our cards at around 6:45, and watched him as he walked around the restaurant with our booklets and cards in his apron until almost 7:00.  Terrible experience. Will not be returning on my next visit to Connecticut.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-stamford,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44

31,Nicole Y.,"San Diego, CA",10,111,105.0,3.0,2017-05-15,"I think my time here at this CPK was just okay. Not the best. I came on Mother's Day with my mom and brother for lunch. They do have gluten free pizza dough, so my mom and I got that and it was delicious. Both of us were only able to finish half our pizzas. She ordered a raspberry tea and it was not real tea. It was syrup. Tasted like sugary gross fake tea, so she just got a regular iced tea and that was fine. The reason for my three stars is the service. We were seated immediately, but the food took a long time to come out. There were not that many people there, but our server was not attentive whatsoever. I understand that waiters have other tables to tend, but she was just standing behind the bar texting.. She forgot to bring out my water and forgot to make us teas. I personally, did not enjoy this particular location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-stamford,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72

Asked the waitress for advice on what to order and her suggestions were great we had a pizza with beacon, lettuce, onion, mushrooms and cheese, the Ribeyes was flavorful and delicious, love love the avocado egg roll club and crispy Mac and cheese. It was nice that the General manager came to our table and spoke to us for a bit very nice person and asked if everything was to our pleasing. Yes it was.

28,Lourdes M.,"Bellerose, NY",172,578,1373.0,3.0,2018-01-09,"I love CPK. This location is a non-busy branch during a  mid-week lunchtime visit.  I enjoyed - as always - their flat breads (white truffle and mint seasoned this time)  and salad (which I shared with my niece) combination for a fair price. I loved their cucumber infused drink, it was so refreshing. My niece enjoyed her pumpkin pie dessert which she found out later on that the serving size was good for two people. It was a lovely visit. The location is within the shopping center of the downtown center. Quiet and safe neighborhood. The wait staff who served us was excellent- even provided us a tip to get to the train station the easiest way.  I would love to come back if will be in the area again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-stamford,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84
