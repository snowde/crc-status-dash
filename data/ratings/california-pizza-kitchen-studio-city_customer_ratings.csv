My friend and I came here on our lunch hour and indulged in their white pizza, which was good but maybe a little oily and could have used more garlic. We also started with mojitos, which were good! and had their spinach and artichoke dip, which was absolutely delicious. That dip, yum. Our waitress was really nice and bubbly, everyone said goodbye to us as we left, it was awesome. They also have a newly designed menu with more delicious and healthier options. Nice job, CPK.

I really didn't know that this is a much smaller CPK than the usual ones, but we were seated within 5 minutes. Our waitress was prompt with handing us our menus, bread and water. We both ordered our separate pizzas and within 10 minutes of putting in our order, we both got our pizzas. I had to dock this spot a star because our pizzas came out luke-warm, which is unusual because when we order our pizzas at other locations, that isn't the case. No, it didn't take the taste away from the food, just an observation. Overall, this location makes the cut. On top of the luke-warm food, took another star off for parking situation, as you're either stuck looking for metered parking (although it's free on Sundays, yay!) or their parking structure, where you get 90 mins. free with validation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-studio-city?start=80,3.48,3.48,3.48,2.9560000000000004,3.4800000000000004

LOVE KIDS! I for one can't stand them! Yes, I have one and that's about all I can handle. BIG Mistake!!! to ask my little human where he'd like to go for dinner the other night - his first choice was Dan Tana's (that's my boy) but last minute No! then he said Bucca de Beppo or whatever the name of the place was and I just didn't feel like dealing with the whole Universal City Walk thing then he said CPK. Shoot me now! is what I thought when we walked in - the hostess grabbed some menus and went to seat us and I thought I was going to die. There was not one quiet table in the place and every single table had kids at it - LOTS of them! I ended up asking to sit at the first two seats at the bar, closest to the door. And get this - even another parent was seated at the further end of the bar with TWO KIDS! Shit, I don't know how everyone in the place doesn't need a drink OR FIVE to deal with the commotion in here. I thought it was an elementary or preschool fundraiser night - Nope! The staff confirmed it's ALWAYS like this. Holy shit! Save me now. That was the last time I will step foot in this place.  Curbside to go is the way to go, unless you wish to dine in hell. Mommy and Me class, meets Gymboree, meets the Circus or wherever the hell people take young kids. Just thinking of what the adult to child ratio of this place is raises my blood pressure.

So I do, the guy who took my order told me that they'd be able to deliver since it was such a big order. So I say ok great. An hour before my sons party they call to say oh hey sorry we can't deliver, we don't delver on weekends. I was so pissed. Why would you wait to call that late? You didn't think it'd be smart to call when you opened and first saw my order? So I send my husband, they completely messed up my order. And on top of that I had ordered 2 Mac n Cheese trays that I was told they had and cost $40, well they gave me 2 kid orders of Mac n Cheese. Which was not enough to feed the 34 kids at the party. Because they messed up they did comp the pizza, but yet 4 salads and 2 kids orders of Mac n Cheese cost me $200? How does that even add up? Such a horrible experience.

When the food arrived I was quite hungry.  For a minute I thought wow this really hits the spot... it sure does. I pulled a coiled METAL ROD out of the chicken.  How I found it I will never know because the chicken looks like confetti and you could barely see it.  I almost put it in my mouth and look down. When the server asked how my lunch was I showed him and he got his manager right away.  He took it back to the kitchen and when I asked him what it was he said, ""oh that's a piece of the machine we use to cut our mushrooms."" Oh good to know for some reason I thought it was a piece of chicken. I was accomodated and the chef for some reason was chatting up friends and standing near the door.  He never once approached me or apologized as I left he said, ""don't worry I catch hell for this.""  Nothing remotely like I would expect him to react and that was certainly not my intention.

I swear I didn't puff the magic dragon before walking in, but I ate my whole pizza and then was eating a slice off of my sister's plate and another one that was on the table. I'm surprised I didn't try to reach over to the table next to me and cop a slice before they cleaned off their table.  CPK is definitely a nice date night place. The main downside for me is that for what it is, Pizza, it is on the pricey side. I really wanted a drink also, but I think pints were being sold at 6-8 which is ok... I guess?

As they have a large and rather innovative selection of pizzas that are generally better in quality than those of other large pizza chains, I tend to be a fan of California Pizza and would rate their food as four stars. This particular location, however, only gets three stars from me as I have been to locations which I've found to be considerably better. This particular location tends to be crowded, particularly with screaming kids whose parents seem to encourage them to be as obnoxious as possible, and slow awkward service.

Right when I was seated I was hit with the stench of the restroom. Now my table was placed all the way across the room from the restrooms, it shouldn't be smelling this bad from across the room. Gross. My next complaint is about how over crowded it is. This is a sad excuse for a restaurant. My back was literally touching another persons. They squished way to many tables in there.  My 3rd complain is about their waiters. It took about 20-25 minutes for them to come and take our order for drinks. Not only did they take forever to ask and bring back, but they managed to mess up our drink order.  My 4th complaint is about their appetizers. I literally dream about their artichoke and spinach dip. How in the world do they manage to ruin a simple dip is amazing. Not only did the dip taste nasty but the chips were stale.  My last complaint is about their dishes. I ordered a soup with a water, and both of the dishes tasted like Clorox. I sent both back and right away my appetite disappeared.  I would never recommend this place to anyone. This place is literally disgusting and dirty. I will never come back.

This location really follows through with those polices and makes your evening and meal that much nicer. In Los Angeles, it sometimes can be hard to go to chain or corporate owned restaurants and have a warm experience. Many restaurants have servers who are overworked and focused on heavy sales and also have a high turnover rate and each visit can seem like they fired everyone and got new people. CPK in the Valley, has the charm and feel of a nice local restaurant.

What an amazing guy who really enjoys his job and makes every effort for people to enjoy themselves while out to eat.  Each child was given an apron (chef coat for the birthday girl!) and chef hat. Our lovely server Melanie (cute red head) made sure the kids were happy and ready to make their own pizzas. She brought them dough, sauce and all the fixins.  The kids had a blast making and designing their own pizza. Who wouldn't?  After their pizzas were ready to go into the oven, Joe Baylis arranged for the kids to have a tour of the kitchen and see their pizzas go into the oven. Melanie took the kids on the tour and introduced the kids to the nicest kitchen staff in town. After the tour, they returned to their seats and their pizzas were brought out to them.  Delicious!

After speaking to the female manager b/c clearly Joe is incompetent of customer service or any type of follow-up, I called my bank - at which point they told me: If CPK doesn't have / keep records of these transactions, but it was deducted from your account to theirs, it's completely illegal (...well, duh) and that they see people go through this all the time and the vendors like to take money, not give so just file a claim and don't waste any more time w/ the business. The female manager called me back after she spoke to her busy GM (at dinner) and said they'll refund my money. They wanted to keep questioning my bank. Really? Chase is stealing my money under CPK? I hardly doubt that. I sent them my bank statement via email and it still wasn't good enough b/c THEY COULD NOT FIND IT ON THEIR SIDE (not my issue - and how much tax are you not going to pay b/c of this ""technical issue?"") So after all that, I still had to threaten them to report them to IRS to get my refund. Will I EVER go to ANY CPK? Probably NOT. And when did their FOOD GET SO BAD? You WASTED so much of my TIME!!!

My first reaction was the great ambiance of the whole place being on the second floor and having lots of windows to look out. But I was tired and just wanted to make a pick up for food. I asked the young lady about the dinner choice my friend had suggested and she verified how great it was. I hinted maybe I would like to order dessert and she kindly took the time to go through the sweets menu with me until I found something.  As I sat and waited for my order, she walked over a sample of flat bread, one of the small dishes they serve, recommending I try it since it was my first time to a CPK.  The time and effort just put into the little gestures she offered, extra bread, utensils, the sample of food, was extraordinary considering I had just walked in for take out. I was so tired and weary having a long commute home from work, but I literally left smiling and really thankful I stopped in to this location. I thanked her graciously for all her help and she mentioned her name was Jane. She also said her card was on the hostess stand. On the way out I picked up the card only come to find out she was the General Manager. wow!   Working in the Food and Beverage industry for over ten years it was a gift to have someone take the extra time and effort as Jane did just to make my first experience a memorable one.

I told them that this was the 2nd time that that has happened to me and I was very frustrated.  Almost 15 minutes later the woman comes out with the kids pizza.  After a quick apology, she said, ""The trick is that you have to bypass the call center and speak directly with the restaurant.""  What?!? There is a ""trick"" to ordering that is different than what the directions on the phone explicitly say?  It is shocking to me that there should be a ""trick,"" and that CPK has not figured this out yet and made it clear to the caller how to place a pick-up order.  At this point she saw I had 2 screaming kids in the back, I had waited 2x the amount of time that she initially told me after they had messed up/lost my order, yet she passed me the bill for the $6 kids pizza.  I do not expect to receive free food, but I expected to receive some acknowledgement of the screw up.  She told me she could let her manager know and see what they could do.  I told her I didn't have time to wait any more.  And also, I'm surprised that the manager didn't know/wasn't told about this kind of issue.     So, to the Manager of CPK:  Please address the automated instructions to place a pick-up order so that customers aren't expected to know a ""trick"" so that they can actually get their order.  And please take care of dissatisfied customers that are victims of your errors.   There are many other great family friendly and pizza places in the neighborhood that I will be taking my business to in the future--PizzaRev, The Counter, Loteria, Maria's, Pagliacci's, Mexicali, Lemonade, Granville, etc., etc., etc.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-studio-city?start=80,3.36,3.48,3.48,2.5960000000000005,3.4320000000000004

12,Nick I.,"Los Angeles, CA",76,192,393.0,2.0,2017-06-10,"Tonight, my wife and, I decided to have dinner here, and I think we would've been better off, going somewhere else. I have been eating at California Pizza Kitchen since it started catching on (circa 1990's) here throughout the Southland, and within the last ten years, I've noticed a gradual decline in customer service. Although, their servers are halfway decent, there isn't that customer to server connection that there was, years ago. Our night began with what seemed like two teenaged girls at the outside entrance taking our names down, to get us a table. I had asked for a booth, and was quickly accommodated. Shortly after we sat down, two menus were slide across the table, as we were told our server would be right with us. For starters, we ordered their classic Spinach - Artichoke Dip along with the Avocado Club Egg rolls. They tasted just like mini Club Sandwiches but, I could tell they used liquid smoke to help ramp up the flavor. Being a Chef, I can tell that Bacon, if cured properly, wouldn't need any additives like Liquid Smoke. Next, I dipped into the Spinach - Artichoke Dip. It tasted creamy as always but, I noticed they were offering less, as far as portion size goes. Just as we were finishing the appetizers, our entrees finally arrived. I had the Hearth Roasted Halibut on a Cedar Plank with roasted Asparagus, butternut Squash, Farro, and baby Kale. The fish tasted very good. It was tender and, juicy but, a bit under seasoned for my palette. The Asparagus, and Squash were cooked perfectly. My wife had the Thai Crunch Salad, (which ended up being too spicy for her to eat, so we had to send it back.) and, to drink, we had Strawberry Lemonade, and an Iced Tea, without Lemon. After the bad experience with my wife's meal, we asked for the check,(which they conveniently took their time with) so that we could leave. Oh, and, we never were asked if we wanted refills on our drinks, nor were we asked how everything was. I guess, these days, the staff have better things to do than to care about customer service. Honestly? I regretfully say, California Pizza Kitchen isn't what it used to be.

My hubby ordered the halibut... which he said was great. However, I ordered the crunchy Thai salad and had a less than favorable experience. Don't get me wrong, the flavor was 100% there, and it tasted wonderfully, but what they neglected to mention in the description on the menu was that the dressing was spicy. So, for someone who has ulcers and chronic acid reflux, having spicy anything is no bueno. So, I returned the salad and asked to have the item removed from the bill (which they happily did), and gave me a menu so I could order something less taxing on my digestive system. After I browsed the menu, I had finally made a selection and waited for the server to return. Then waited some more, and another 20 minutes on top of that. By the time the server came back, my husband was already done with his meal; there was really no point in ordering anything else since my hubby was already done. I then asked the server for the check... another ten minutes passes, and the check finally came. I gave him my card, then it took another ten minutes for him to bring it back.

Any restaurant with more than 10 units and/or any restaurant with Corporate Regulatory Structures."" As we're aware this can have it's definite share of pros ANDDDD cons. I mean hell, we've all viewed McDonald's locations that can't get it right to save their own lives and we've just as easily viewed franchise success stories like Fat Burger, In-N-Out and Starbucks that seemingly blow your mind by delivering ""satisfaction"" EACH AND EVERY TIME. Emphasis on ""BUH-LOWWW""! Well, my lovelies California Pizza Kitchen (CPK for ""us"" regulars) falls into the latter end of the aforementioned bracket and with over 200 locations to date, some of which are international, this is palpably the SINGLE ONE franchise that actually got the memo in doing things COMPLETELY right! (.....bows to pay homage.... ""I'm not worthy."") Home of the ""perfect pizza"", this particular location - flatbread'ing on Ventura Blvd. within Studio City just somehow does it for me!  Parking is (somewhat) accessible and the views from upstairs are spectacular. To be frank, I don't even much care for pizza. I attribute that to my Cal Poly days of late night flatbread and Ramen noodle binges. I mean seriously,.....we were sooooo- broke that we could barely afford to pay attention and pizza was pretty much all that we could collectively scrounge up funds for simply to satisfy our late night cravings. Need I say more???  Well, take my word for it when I say that, what Domino's and Pizza Hut may have ruined for me then, CPK has DEFINITELY managed to redeem. We're talking carne asada pizzas, wild mushroom pizzas and the list goes on and on like Donkey Kong's schlong!!!! If you can think it, THEY CAN MAKE IT!!!, and the bliss doesn't eclipse there as the salad selections are just as wonderful as is their variance of other options, i.e. the jambalaya!  #Yazz-Gawd'! This Southern inspired dish should be illegal! It's sinfully DELICIOUS and encompasses a bit a new age flare on an otherwise classic fave-!!! #somebody-spank-&-cuff-me!!! Alas,.... what CPK has managed to do, ladies and famished Yelping gents, is THEIR HOMEWORK. Sharpening their pencils on the perfection of culinary preparation as well as erasing any such misconceptions of subpar customer service.  I find that feat, to be orgasmic, within itself. The result of their having attended a session or two of summer school is this certifiably happy camper, whose thrilled to provide 5 stars while fervently testifying that ""CPK ......... CP-Slays!!!""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-studio-city,3.28,3.45,3.45,,3.382
44,Alex C.,"Los Angeles, CA",256,11,1.0,4.0,2017-07-28,"So I went to CPK the other night and had my first absolutely awful experience a couple nights ago, but I'm not going to base my single yelp review off of my first and only experience at this restaurant. Let's just say our server was also the bartender and the only time we saw her was when she took our order, filled our drinks (after) our entire meal, and to give us the check. A hostess ended up checking on us to make sure we were okay when we ran out of bread and ended up bringing us more instead of our server as well as when our food items were on the counter a brilliant server named Carl brought us our dishes, which were ignored by MULTIPLE employees specifically waiting for their table's dishes. We ended up finding our initial server behind the bar serving the 3 people she had sitting up there. To be honest, I get it she had to be the bartender and on the floor but you should not have someone work both if they cannot give decent service to both. The only time we saw her was after the seats at the bar cleared and we were already done with our meal. Again, this CPK is great and this is just about the only bad experience I've ever had here but it was really really bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-studio-city?start=40,3.36,3.44,3.44,,3.4080000000000004

23,Ella F.,"San Francisco, CA",590,21,2.0,2.0,2017-08-15,"I feel so bad giving this review cause ive always loved CPK especially in newport beach. But its become one of those places where the food looks really good in the pictures but taste like absolute shit. Im not sure what happened their food used to be so good. The pizza was so bland and wet, the dumplings were drenched in chives and cilantro. It might be different if there prices werent so high. Literally got two small flatbread pizzas and two appetizers for 70$. And the dishes were dirty. The service was so nice though I honestly couldnt complain about the food to them. This place is really not worth your money, I hope it changes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-studio-city?start=20,3.28,3.42,3.42,,3.3640000000000003

1,Daren C.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,24,8.0,2.0,2017-11-04,"We frequent this CPK location, but the service we received last night was probably the worst we've received at this CPK or any CPK for that matter. We're probably in this CPK or the Encino location at least once a week. Understandably, it was a busy Friday evening and they were backed up. However, it took about 20min from the time we ordered drinks before they arrived. These were not specialty drinks... just simple straight pours.  During that time, the server stopped by 2-3 times saying it would be one moment because the bartender was backed up. What was even more frustrating is there was never an apology. The server was so cavalier about it with comments like ""it'll be just a minute guys"" as we saw others around us being served. When the drinks came, we declined them and decided to leave since we were over it.  Again, we totally understand being busy... but at least have the employees trained to properly make the situation right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-studio-city,3.56,3.43,3.43,,3.482
16,Noelle W.,"Santa Monica, CA",9,16,,5.0,2017-11-17,"Not usually a fan of major chains but there's no denying CPK is yummy every.single.time. Excellent service, delicious individual pizza and salad (great lunch special) and fair pricing. If you're up for major ambiance and super creative culinary experience, drive on. But meeting a friend for a meal and want to catch up in a comfy booth with satisfying food (including complimentary scrumptious bread), friendly service and no super loud music blaring?

We had to switch out some drinks and also ask for a bunch of extras and she had an amazing attitude about it and made our dining experience very enjoyable.

0,Gigi D.,"Los Angeles, CA",1038,662,3193.0,4.0,2017-12-18,"For someone with lots of food allergies, you'd never expect them to actually like a CALIFORNIA PIZZA KITCHEN, considering PIZZA is in the name of the restaurant and I can't eat pizza... That being said, don't be fooled by the name, this sit down chain restaurant has SO MUCH TO OFFER, I actually bet the restaurant secretly wants to change its name to California Kitchen.  I've been once before (different location) and really did love what I got... So much so, I ordered it again, and while the portion was pretty small (despite getting both chicken and salmon to top off my vegetable salad), I loved it none the less. NOW THAT is saying something for me too because typically even if Food is good, I get really upset when the portions are small. My husband and our friends all REALLY enjoyed their meals too: my husband got the chicken fettachini Alfredo with broccoli, and our friends got the rib eye and Caesar Salad with Milinase Chicken. YUM! We were all happy campers.  To top off the meal, we ordered the butter cake and the chocolate cake. While the chocolate cake was a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT that was taken away from our table (and we weren't charged for it) the BUTTER CAKE was out of this world. So if you do eat sweets, that dessert is HIGHLY recommended by my friends and husband! I'll be making CPK a staple in my husband and my restaurant rotation, despite the service being slightly slow... Again, it was worth it.  Oh and I have to note, our server at this location, Jamie... PHENOMENAL! Friggin' loved her. If she weren't working I totally would have asked her to pull a chair up and join us. Oh wait, even though she WAS WORKING, I still asked her to pull a chair up, ha ha!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-studio-city,3.72,3.49,3.49,,3.5820000000000003

4,Jonathan T.,"Bloomingdale, NJ",109,41,16.0,5.0,2018-01-11,"Loved every second here! I got two apps and both were very delicious... chicken dumplings and avocado with chips. The table got 6 entrees and we split each one... four pizzas: Spinach Avocado with Greens, BQQ Chicken with onions, Cajun Jerky Chipotle, and Dry Roasted Garlic Chicken. BQQ was good as always. Cajun had a mild kick and was very filling in a good way. Dry roasted was a bit bland. Spinach Avocado was really good all the mixtures really complemented each other. Bolognese Pasta was very meaty and filling, loved it as the finisher. The dessert was out of this world... NOT KIDDING, no regret getting it and my spoon couldn't be dropped for the Caramel Whip Cream Pudding.
