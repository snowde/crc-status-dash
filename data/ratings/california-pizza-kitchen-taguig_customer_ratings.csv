0,Mariel F.,"Maynila, Philippines",169,276,571,5.0,2015-05-29,"I've always liked CPK. I've been coming here since they opened maybe 10 years ago and I've never had a bad meal here. I believe and it goes without saying that this is the best food franchise we've ever gotten from the States (of course not counting the obvious American fast food chains) I tried the BGC branch a few nights ago with my boyfriend who has never eaten here before. I made him try the Thai crunch salad and their prosciutto pizza, both my staples for some years now, I can't eat here without having any of the two. I don't know if it was just me but the chef of this branch so far may be the best one out of all their branches. Everything just tasted better than normal. I don't know why. I actually asked the server to give my commendation to the chef. It was that good. This branch is smaller than others albeit newer and more sophisticated. I had a great meal that night with my favorite person in the world, all thanks to that mystery chef! Kudos!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-taguig,,,,,
2,Michael G.,"Taguig, Philippines",0,37,20,3.0,2016-02-13,"Friendly staff and good pizza, but with some issues: You expect a pizza place to offer delivery, and they do. But its miserable. They're perpetually under staffed so they can't even make simple deliveries to nearby condos within a five minute walk. Rather they ask you to call an outsourced delivery service like Food Panda, who then quotes a delivery time of 90 minutes!!! For a restaurant that's a 5 minute walk away??? Oh & they have a 750p minimum order too, so after 10 minutes wasted on the phone, they wouldn't deliver my food anyway. They also changed their menu about a year ago & took away many of their classic favorites. No more Peking duck pizza, no more tartuffo, no more apple crumble.  They're pizza is good, but not great. Better than Yellow Cab or Papa Johns. But the best pizza in BGC can be found at nearby Caffe Puccini. Oh and Caffe Puccini offers reasonable delivery too!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-taguig,,,,,
1,Ysa A.,"Makati, Philippines",0,1,1,3.0,2017-04-16,"The food and the ambiance was great and I didn't mind sitting near the kitchen area. We ordered pizza and the 3-dip appetizer. The restaurant location (BGC) was also a plus but what ruined the whole experience was when one of the crew started taking the ""almost empty"" plates while one of us was still eating. We told him that we're still eating and he took the empty pizza plate (which is ok). He also put the dipping sauce one by one on the table and took the plate. It was rude. I understand that the place had a waiting list but it insinuates that they want us to leave right away. We would've if they served the food faster.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-taguig,,,,,
