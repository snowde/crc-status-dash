The feel to this restaurant is pretty simple a lot of elderly folks come here which is cool and it seems like that is what it has become a family hang out, not much for a dinner with a friend, date, or just quiet time alone. It was soo loud and the little child next to me kept on making a mess.. The food was tasteless and cold..

228,Edward W.,"Milton, GA",218,850,246.0,3.0,2012-01-28,"2 5 stars.  Based on one visit... CP-just oK.  Typical CPK food. Good salads, decent pizzas, good iced tea... Why just 2.5 stars, oh Yelp-addicted one? Here's why.  First, parking is a mess.  Not enough spots.  Tight spaces.  I'd bet they have frequent fender benders in this lot.  Thank goodness the lovely and beautiful M, my terrific but demolition derby-prone wife, does not come to this store often.  I'd have to have a good auto body place on speed dial.  Meeting me here today, I felt fortunate that she parked on Ventura Blvd. Then inside, it took a server 15 minutes to come to the table to greet us, and that was only after I stood up and waved my arms like a football linesman stopping the play clock (you guys know what that looks like).  Our salads were snail-paced in coming out, too.  Not sure what's up with this store, but I didn't have the same management-level service that others had mentioned at this location. To recap:  Decent food, but heads up on the service.  And parking made me consider putting ""CPK"", ""parking"" and ""valet"" in the same sentence.  That just doesn't seem right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tarzana?start=120,3.404,3.404,3.404,3.404,3.4040000000000004

195,Lauren D.,"Encino, CA",4,8,,1.0,2012-06-01,"I never ever write reviews, and I love CPK, but this is the first time I have been here since I've discovered I have a gluten intolerance. First off, before we sat down, I asked for a gluten free menu. The hostess said they didn't have one but the nutritional info might help (it didn't). I open the regular menu & there are little circles with ""GF"" next to gluten free options. This alone definitely wasn't review worthy alone, but c'mon, a hostess at a big franchise restaurant like this should know at least where allergen information is listed.  Anyways, what really got me was that I love the BBQ chopped salad but saw the tortilla strips weren't gluten free. I asked the waitress if they were really flour tortillas (restaurants won't include foods that are processed in facilities that process wheat b/c people with celiac generally cannot process these foods, but I've discussed I can tolerate these foods without issues). She didn't seem too willing to find out for me, so I gave up & ordered the veggie salad (blah!). A few secs later I called her back with a great idea (I really love that BBQ chopped salad... but whats a BBQ chopped salad without a little crunch?). I asked if the chef could crush a few corn chips on top of the BBQ salad for me instead of the ones made for the salad since I saw that they were included on the small bite menu as ""GF."" Extremely confident that she would come back with great news, she told me ""they were really busy and couldn't accommodate substitutions."" Sorry, but I didn't realize grabbing 3 chips and closing your hand was that much work. Now, maybe I'm just sick of being gluten free & never being able to have anything yummy without having to pay double the price of a non-gluten free item, but a restaurant of this size should educate their employees and be a little more willing to ""accommodate"" our simple requests. I know I was in a pizza kitchen, but it's not like I'm asking for gluten free pizza to magically appear (like BJs Brewery and Pizza Cookery)! ;)  It's not just a fad diet people, we really do get sick if we eat wheat, but we still like to enjoy our food. Grr! Anyways, I'll probably give it another shot, but hopefully not at this location!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tarzana?start=160,3.0760000000000005,3.0760000000000005,3.0760000000000005,3.0760000000000005,3.076000000000001
173,Chelsea K.,"Agoura Hills, CA",2,13,,5.0,2012-07-22,"I've had several very pleasant experiences at this CPK recently. I'm a vegetarian with a dairy allergy, and between the detailed information on their website (they actually have a separate ovo-vegetarian menu which I've never seen anywhere else!) and their very helpful staff, I've been able to get delicious food here without issue. They'll remove cheese (and meat) from any of their pizzas, you can sub avocado for meat, and add more veggies.

124,Chris H.,"Jourdanton, TX",46,33,7.0,3.0,2012-09-03,"So, we went here and got a booth seat. The wait for a drink wasn't bad or horrible. It was on time, and the waiter was so sweet. He was prompt. He was funny. He took our drink order and came back and gave us all our drinks. I think it was my mom who had to ask again for her wine, but past that, it was good service, since there was no one there, practically( at 11:30am/Noon)empty. When we ordered our meal, it was fairly fast and no wait, like, none at all. Very little wait. I love CPK.     CPK s one of my favorite places. The one thing I didn't like was that there was a family with kids that were screaming at the top of their lungs and I thought that it was going to be louder. The parents did nothing to calm down the kids, either. When they left it was so much quieter. It was so much better. No more bratty kids screaming at the top of their lungs.  Their menus are smaller now. :( I liked when they were bigger and had more soups. And more pizza. It was better before. I loved taking my time to look at the intricate dishes on the menu. My parents were looking for the broccoli soup they had ordered once, and tried to make. I also noticed that they have only two soups...not many to chose from. I would've liked to order my two favorite soups. The potato chowder and the tortilla soup. yum. :) They only have the tortilla soup with is one of my favorites. I highly recommend it, by the way. I noticed that they have a good handful of everything, except the soups. There were only two this time. Only two. Two soups...wow. And the kind waiter let us know that they deleted it by costumer feedback. Why!? I loved the soup selection they had before! I don't care what other people think.

183,Yu W.,"WOODLAND HILLS, CA",159,179,106.0,3.0,2012-12-11,"the last time i stepped foot into a CPK was probably about 4 years ago when my parents came to visit me in Irvine. AND for some reason, i remember it being a whole lot nicer.  THIS LOCATION was clean, well kept and the staff was super friendly.  BUT for the PRICE that they charge for their food, i was expecting a WHOLE LOT more in the QUALITY of the food and presentation.  we ordered a thin crust margharita pizza, avocado egg rolls and the bbq chicken salad. the total came out to $38 plus tip. so about $45.00 for 3 people.  1. margharita pizza  - the pizza came out with (what looked like) canned tomato cubes, bits of basil (instead of whole leaf) and a few slices of some salty mozzarrella cheese. the bottom wasn't crispy at all the first time they brought it out and we actually sent it back to be cooked some more.  2. avocado egg rolls - these were money. but maybe because it had a lot of bacon in it (and who doesn't like a lot of bacon in anything). it just didn't taste gourmet in my opinion.  3. bbq chicken salad - this was probably my favorite of the night. chicken was moist. not too much bbq sauce and the ice berg lettuce was nice and cold.  *when i asked for bread, they brought out cold slices of bread that you could buy at a grocery store!!! they didn't even warm them up for us to make it seem like they baked them fresh! i was almost tempted to ask them to toast the slices for us, but decided that it wasn't even worth the effort to ask and eat.  in my personal opinion. for $45 for 3 people. go to BJ Restaurant down the street in Woodland HIlls or Salvemini's Italian Kitchen (GREAT PIZZA).

I have never tried something from the menu that I did not like...A few days ago, I wanted to treat my parents to dinner before they left the country to visit Guatemala so I decided to bring them to this location. We had great customer service from our waiter David. My mom ordered the Tequilla Spaghetti and loved it. My dad ordered the BBQ Chicken classic pizza but I added serrano chili to it. (If you love spice, you should try it too!) I ordered my favorite, the Kung Pao Spaghetti with chicken and shrimp. My parents loved it just as much as I did. We ordered my nephew a cheese pizza and he had a great time playing with the children's activity book they gave him while we waited for the order. After our meal, the manager came up to our table and asked us if we enjoyed our meal. I told him this was one of my favorite restaurants and that my parents had never been but they loved it too. He was so glad to hear this, that he offered us dessert on the house! My parents are very hard to impress, and this CPK did everything right.

160,Donna W.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",2,164,121.0,2.0,2013-05-02,"Many many years ago we used to go to this location often.  CPK is my sisters favorite place to eat so we always wind up eating there when we go out together. After my sister and mother suffered some dysentery upset after a visit to the Tarzana store, it was decided we would go to the Westfield Plaza location.  Indeed we have been going there for the last 10 years. Unfortunately they are moving to another location in the mall and has been closed for many months with the re-opening for sometime ""in the summer"". The Tarzana location, like many restaurants, seem to ""cycle"".  Sometimes they are good and sometimes not so good.   I fear this location is going through some PMS at this point. It started with our server Mireya.  She honestly seemed to not only been disinterested but annoyed that she was having to work.   We placed our order, and did ask for some bread with the meal.  Sad with CPK's increase in prices they have gone to a different kind of bread. Rather then those nice slices of soft bread they would bring with butter, they now served a little hunk of ""bread"" that one would need shark teeth to eat.  Instead of butter they bring a little bowl of oil because they know that one would need to marinate it in the oil overnight in order to be able to chew it, obviously I have no intention of camping out overnight so I can eat it.  So much for the bread.    With my order I am very specific as to how I like the crust cooked.   Now mind you the Topanga location would always get it right and in fact when I ate at this location two months ago after the first attempt they got it right the second time.  So this time our order comes our server plunks it down on the table and skitters off.  I thought it looked a bit overcooked but as always was willing to be open minded and wait and see.  I started eating the lettuce that is served on top of it.  Our waitress- while on the move- asked how everything was- I had lettuce in my mouth, sis mentioned ok.   I NEVER SAW THE WAITRESS AGAIN.  We never got our drinks refilled.  Meanwhile the other servers who were in our area checked their tables often.  Mireya was nowhere to be seen.  Thank goodness I had ordered extra dressing because much like the bread this thing needed to be drenched in dressing to be able to eat. For the record I have all my own teeth and chewing is not an issue for me! How is it that a paper thin crust is so overcooked that one could use it for heat resistant tiles on the Space Shuttle?  It was after 1 PM and I had not eaten in about 24 hours and I was starved.  Since our server never came by I ate about half of it and that was it.  It took my sister another 20 minutes to finish her meal at which time our server finally appeared with our check.   I asked her that if I were to come there again what kind of instructions would it take to get my order correct.  She replied that she supervised this herself and flounced away. The manager came by and was VERY NICE.  He explained that now they are doing the crusts different and there will be no way to get a lightly cooked crust any more. According to him that CPK is going through some changes.  Now they are PRE-COOKING the crusts and then leaving them out.  When its time for them to be used they prepare them and cook them again.  So although I have been able to get it right in the past he said this will no longer be the case.  Again he was very nice and he did take my meal off the order. So kudos to the manager, even though he told me that I can not ever again get my food cooked the way it was before and to my liking.  At least I know that this CPK is off my list for good.  I will give Westfield a chance of course when the re-open. If I am forced to go to this location again with my sister (I sure hope the Westfield location is open in July when I see my sister again) I will just order some water.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tarzana?start=200,3.84,3.84,3.84,2.472,3.84

I did curbside not because I'm lazy but because i have a child who is restless.  upon entering the parking lot, the keyes keyes keyes..keyes on van nuys luxury lineup was parked in the spaces designated specifically for curbside and GUESS WHAT..they weren't picking up curbside. If it was not enough that these car owners do not use turn signals but now they are encroaching on CPK's customer's right to pickup curbside? I found a regular parking space, called the lady to tell her that i was outside and five minutes later, I got nothing. I walk in with my little one and wait at the take out line (at this point it was 5 minutes after they said it would be ready) and told the lady i had a pickup order failing to tell her that i was the one who called and was waiting outside. The manager, noticing my demeanor inquired on how everything was and i shrugged and looked away. she continues to engage me and proceeds to ask if there was an issue with the service and i tell her the parking lot is like the wild west of CPK parking lots and that i was unable to park in the designated space in addition to not getting someone to come out after i had called.  at this point the woman helping me with my order is ignoring me because she's probably the one who answered and the manager says to me that she hasn't been paying attention to the parking lot because she has been managing the restaurant, not in a mean way but in a CYA kind of way where she can absolve herself from any culpability for letting autonation park up front, so by that logic, dont' bother telling the manager about a clogged toilet on your visit, because SHE'S managing a restaurant.  I'm no lawyer, but a service that involves your establishment's food is part of managing a restaurant. FURTHERMORE, instead of addressing  the issue she felt like she could have addressed (i.e. not having someone come out after i call) she automatically defers that topic and tells me she's basically not in charge of the spots designated for curbside  . so there you go. you want scorched earth? you got it. She could have said absolutely nothing and i would not be writing this.  one star for getting the order right and for being open when i got there",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tarzana?start=140,3.8,3.8,3.8,2.372,3.8

We were starved so getting seated quickly was the best. The waitress was fast on the drinks and was helpful about suggestions and modifications to my dinner. Food was brought out not too much later and it has ok. I've had better pasta plates elsewhere but hey, it's called a pizza kitchen for a reason. They're slightly pretentious in having certain items on the menu but overall the food is made ok. Pizza is their signature dish and I definitely enjoyed trying my friends pizza.

114,Rachel C.,"Los Angeles, CA",723,68,31.0,4.0,2013-07-29,"This CPK is one of the good ones. Though sometimes they have their off days.  I have been coming here quite a while and as a whole, they are a pretty good restaurant. I started coming here more since they decided to ruin the Topanga Mall one by throwing it in the middle of the mall. Call me bland, normal, too original etc. But my favorite pizza here is the original cheese (slightly undercooked so it isn't burned on the crusts)  When I come here, we order two appetizers (Avocado Spring Rolls, Spinach Artichoke Dip and/or Sesame Wontons) they are to die for. I will get my Pina Colada which surprisingly amazing especially with extra pineapple! My friends will get either the California Club, Original BBQ Chicken Pizza or they will tell the waiter to surprise them and we have a new pizza to try!  However, one tip to CPK if I may. Stop trying to change your menu around so much. I understand that you are trying to keep it interesting, but it's slightly becoming annoying. In the past year or two they have changed the menu twice. Now they have ""unofficially"" taken off the Traditional Cheese from the menu. They did technically replace it with the Five Cheese and Tomatoe pizza which is nothing up to par.  The Five Cheese and Tomato Pizza was the one that our waiter ""surprised"" us with. We were ultra excited to try it. When we did we were slightly let down. First, there is no sauce, it was to be replaced with the large slices of tomato up on top of the pizza....doesnt compare. They cheeses however are great all together, but once you take off the tomato you might as well be eating a stuffed crust pizza at Pizza Hut....or is it Dominoes that has that? Whichever it is, it was good, just a little bit below the standards of what I would expect from CPK.  Want to save loads of money on trips to CPK if you are regulars like we are? Join the Pizza Dough Rewards. Every $100.00 you stack up you get $5 off. Without knowing it, We constantly get $10-20 every other trip because the whole check is added no matter how much I actually pay. So when you go with a large group and split it you still are getting the points on your own card which is great!

After little bit of digging through the pizza, we assumed that it came from the chicken.

Instead of going to the kitchen and worry about safety of others, she puts on this face of doubt, glances at the price of glass that we gave her and says ""hmm, this is not glass, it looks like a piece of plastic"", and looks back at us. In my mind I was like ""is she for real ?!"" Then she proceeds to making this ""mhmm"" sounds when we spoke to her.  After about 3 min of listening to her opinion about that piece of glass that we gave to her and where it came from, she finally slowly walked to the kitchen to talk to the cooks.  While she was gone me and my gf looked closer at the piece of pizza that she was chewing on, and we both agreed that it was imbedded into the dough. When manager came back, we explained to her that we took a closer look and it looks like that piece of glass was in the dough.

Christina just won the company car for the month, because I pulled her name out of the hat, so Christina wanted to celebrate and chose CPK to eat at. I ordered the Fresh Mango Strawberry Cooler to drink. The first time I got the drink, I noticed two very small hairs in it that weren't mine. The waiter was very nice enough to make me a new drink. It was quite delicious, the only thing that sucked is you don't get any refills. We started our lunch off by sharing an appetizer, the spinach artichoke dip, and boy was it good. It had lots of flavor and plenty of chips left over. The only drawback is I wished they used fresh hot tortilla chips, which would definitely compliment the dip. I ordered the Original BBQ Chicken Pizza, and my eyes were definitely much bigger than my stomach. I should have simply just shared a pizza with John and Christina, but knowing me, I always want my own. I ended up giving John and Christina each a slice of my pizza, because after eating some of the spinach artichoke dip, I was a bit stuffed. The pizza was flavorful, however the crust was way too thick. Also, the crust was a bit lopsided, so it looked like they were in a rush to get the pizza in the oven instead of kneeding it more evenly. I think there could have been more cheese, because there was way too much bread for the amount of toppings they added on my pizza.

We also order the mac and cheese balls and they came out cold--gross. The waitress kindly took it back and recommended the kids mac and cheese portion as an appetizer. Sadly it barely had any cheese, so it just tasted like you were having fussili pasta. FYI- The tricolore salad is now on a ""secret"" menu.

159,Gita W.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,30,4.0,1.0,2015-03-12,"I arrived on a Wednesday night at 6pm with a party of six. CPK was packed with some sort of school benefit. We should have gone somewhere else. But the host said ""20 minutes"". That didn't seem so terrible.  We waited 30 minutes and when the host approached us, he asked, ""Is a table okay?"" My friend and I stared at him blankly...I was tempted to suggested we actually preferred the floor. Obviously he meant to ask if we preferred a booth. After a moment of our blank stare he said ""I have a table over here, but it's in the middle of the restaurant, is that okay?"" Way to up-sell buddy. My girlfriend, confused, asked ""What's wrong with the table?"" ""Nothing"" he replied, ""I just won't have a booth available for another 20 minutes."" Again, way to up-sell. Obviously, we took the table. The host seated us and quickly returned with the highchair we needed. However, we were still short one chair for the adults. I ended up grabbing one from an unoccupied table. Hey, that's okay, I got it. Our server arrived fairly quickly, especially considering how busy the restaurant was. She took our drink order and they all came back correctly. That's where her expertise ended. We were ready to order when she returned with the drinks. I asked for the Hawaiian BBQ Chicken Pizza with a GF crust. She told me that only certain pizzas could be made GF. Ok...which ones? She listed them off, one of them was the regular BBQ Chicken Pizza. I should note that the only difference (that I could see from the menu) between the Hawaiian and regular BBQ pizza was pineapple. So I asked, can I please have the regular BBQ Chicken pizza, GF crust and add pineapple to it? I swear, the look on her face was ""oh, duh"". Maybe she was new and didn't yet know how to manipulate the menu. That can take a couple months.  Meanwhile, chaos was ensuing around our table. Maybe this is what the host was trying to suggest when he weakly asked if we wanted to wait for a booth. There were kids everywhere and parents were allowing them to run around the restaurant. I saw one kid almost take out a server carrying a tray full of drinks. I'll admit, I kind of wish he'd bumped into her and gotten doused. Maybe he would've learned to watch where he was going. For the server's sake, I'm glad she was on her toes. It was so obnoxious, my girlfriend asked if we could move tables. We got a blank stare from our server. She said that they were so busy, we'd have to check with the host and most likely go back on the wait-list. And by ""we"" she meant us, not her. Talk about ""full service"". So my girlfriend asked the host, but that was a battle not worth fighting. A few minutes later, the server checked on us and asked what we'd decided to do about moving tables. My girlfriend said if it happened, great, but she didn't expect it to. So our server asked, ""So should I put your food order in then?"" I get it. If she put our order in and we moved tables, the servers would have to switch tables and transfer tabs, plus, our food would inevitably go to the wrong table, go back to expo and get cold while the staff figured out where we'd moved to. I get it. At the same time, there are better ways to phrase what she meant. After the server walked away, I wasn't confident that our order was going in, so I found the manager and explained what was going on. She flagged our server and told her to put the order in. A few minutes later, the server came by the table and said, ""So I'll put your order in? You're not going to switch tables after all?"" O. M. G. Given all the confusion, our food actually came out rather quickly. I was surprised. Extra napkins and sauces came out when asked, drinks were refilled and all of the food was correct. After dinner, dirty plates were left stacked on our table. We stacked them as a signal to the server that we were done. By now there were many empty tables around us. She came by several times with empty hands, but the plates were never cleared. We ordered desert and asked for the check. She handed the check to my friend and walked over to the computer to put in our desert order. Somebody find the problem here. Eh? Bueller? Half way to the computer, she paused and doubled back. Deserts took forever. We only ordered 2 brownies. The server came back with our check, came back to take the check, returned with our credit card slip and returned a fourth time after that to ask, ""Did you get your brownies?"" No. No we didn't.  Worst. Experience. Ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tarzana?start=180,3.52,3.52,3.52,2.5000000000000004,3.5200000000000005

But I have had it with California Pizza Kitchen, esp. the one in Tarzana. On one occasion, there was hair in our lettuce wraps, on another occasion, our Sprites were basically watered-down sparkling water. I ask for extra sauce and they always forget. Tonight, I ordered the Chicken Piccata and I rushed over there before they close. I come home and instead of the Chicken Piccata, they have given me some spicy green Fetuccini, which I couldn't even eat a bite of b/c I'm allergic to spicy foods. And they were closed and I couldn't go back and get my order corrected. How on earth does Chicken Picatta get mistaken for spicy Fettucini? And they had forgotten the extra broccoli I ordered. The staff is always rude and act like they're doing you a favor and the time I told them there was hair in the lettuce wraps, they acted like they were frustrated with me.

They all know I love it!! The service was good. I don't know if they got new cooks or something but we order 3 pastas which were  the chicken tequila, the Kung pao spaghetti and the famous Jambalaya. We also order avocado rolls. First of all the pastas were horrible is like they dip them in water or something. They tasted nasty to be honest. The rolls were super greasy and left a bad taste on our mouths. We order the famous bbq chicken pizza and we got the Thai pizza. It was not even cut right and super dry. We just took everything home because my family and girlfriend are not the type who complain. My girlfriend wrote to corporate and they just said sorry for the unconvinced like they didn't even care.

When we were seated my sister noted that the menu seemed longer than another location we were used to going to In culver city, but again that could be due to the amount of time that had passed since we went to a cpk.  There were a lot of new summer drinks and dishes to try. I got the seasonal harvest sangria which was good, and my sister got the white wine sangria. She normally hates alcohol,  but for some reason she loves that sangria. I think it tastes more fruity than most cocktails.  Between the two of us,  we shared the ribeye with argula and potatoes as sides. Everything was cooked well.  My mom got the lettuce wraps with chicken, and she liked it so much that she asked for more of the peanut sauce to take home with her leftovers.  My step dad got the chicken tequila fettuccine,  which is a classic favorite of his that he enjoyed.  My brother wasn't there, but wanted the meat lover's pizza and even though they took it off the menu, the server said that they could make it for him, which was really nice.

187,David H.,"CANOGA PARK, CA",0,6,3.0,1.0,2016-01-14,"To start let me state that I will never be visiting this California Pizza Kitchen again due to the lack of respect and customer service that I experienced at this location. Our server (Ryan) started out great by giving us bread and our wine quickly but things went downhill shortly after that. After my family - except my father! - had our food delivered we waited for the last plate to arrive... and then we kept waiting. Ryan came back and told us that our lack of a request for a side order held the meal up. After another 10 minutes (now 20 minutes) Ryan changed his story saying that there was a mix up between tables and our food wasn't entered. All of this aside, we just wanted to pay (DIDN'T WANT A COMPED MEAL) and leave after speaking to a manager about our experience. Apparently this was also the wrong move. The manager ""Jamie"" came to our table to listen for around 2 minutes before walking off the second we said we would pay and leave. I personally told her after (verbatim) that I felt disrespected and that I felt we received poor customer service. The response to this was that we had said that we would pay and wanted to leave so she left. Apparently this is what I pay CPK's inflated pricing structure for.  I had one of the worst experiences I have ever had at a restaurant (including fast food) and it was ONLY because of how ""Jamie"" treated me and my family. I won't be coming back (not that Jamie cares) and I am calling their corporate office tomorrow (another first) just to complain about the lack of ownership of their manager. Beware if you come after 5 p.m. and have anything negative happen during your dinner as you will be paying the price. FREE ADVICE: When a customer says that maybe another location would be better suited to a larger rush crowd for a fundraiser, answering with ""I beg to differ"" is not very constructive and a weirdly argumentative way to say that you disagree.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tarzana?start=160,2.24,2.9,2.9,2.5960000000000005,2.636

Not a fan of avocado added on to the salad.  Recommendation: if you order to-go, request that they give you more BBQ sauce containers (2-3 extra). The normal is one small, half-filled container, which isn't enough to coat the whole salad. I'd also ask for more ranch dressing too (just in case). The Baked Potato soup is also quality (for a high-ish end pizza chain), with chunks of potato soup. It's good, but not as good as their old Potato Leak soup, which they discontinued a while back. I used to really like the pizza, but maybe my food tasters have changed (or the quality has gone down). The crust is very doughy and the actual topping portion of the pizza is too small.

22,Leana M.,"Austin, TX",0,5,,1.0,2016-03-29,"I had given this restaurant a 5 star rating before but now it's down to 1 because of the service and management I've recently experienced. My husband ordered an iced tea and drank a little then left for work. I stayed by myself to finish my meal and drank the rest of his iced tea bc I wasn't going to let it go to waste. The server brings the bill and charged us 2 iced teas. I bring it to his attention and he said well you were drinking the iced tea. But I never ordered my own iced tea just drank the rest of my husbands. He changed it, but when he brings the bill back he added a charge of $2 because I asked for my chicken to not have seasoning. I have never been charged because I wanted something taken OFF my food. He claims that CPK had to cook new chicken because they pre marinate their food. Why is that my problem? Not everybody wants their meat seasoned.  The manager Jaime came and she is one of the rudest individuals I've ever had the displeasure of meeting. She is unpleasant to talk to so if you have a problem dont even bother asking to see a manager she is no help. She made it very clear that CPK's outlook on service is ""give me your money, don't care if you come back.""  Very displease, this was my third time eating here in the last week and it was the first time I had an issue with my food and service. But now I will not be back and I will tell my friends, family, and whoever else not to go back either.

This Tarzana CPK was so delightful, the food was well prepared and served quickly after ordering. But the thing that impressed us most (and why I'm writing this review) was the attitude of the staff. We were greeted with a big smile by Josie who seated us, and all of the servers and staff were super nice. Maybe CPK treats it's employees really well or they just have a friendly bunch of people working there... whatever the reason, it's amazing how an upbeat attitude can upgrade a restaurant experience.

The best meal here is by far the ribeye. I thought a restaurant called California Pizza Kitchen would have terrible ribeye. Apparently though, one of the worst things here is the pizza! My last experience here was truly awful and if I based my review on that alone it would probably get one star.  The pizza is so bad. It's not fresh at all and packaged into little dough balls. It's so bland and tasteless and they barely put anything on it to make it substantial. Don't get the pizza here, anyone who likes it needs to have there taste buds checked. Another think I did not like here was the macaroni and cheese. I usually actually like the Mac and cheese, but last time I checked it's really bad. The pasta was so soggy and it tasted like nothing. The last thing I got was the original BBQ chicken salad. I'm not even going to waste my time talking about that. The point is food you expect to be good here isn't good at all and the food that you would never think to order at a CPK is actually very good.  The service is a mess. They are terrible at timing. The don't know when to serve the food at all. Five minutes after they gave me my bread and drinks, they brought out the Mac and cheese, cheese pizza, and salad. That is actually unbelievable. I mean what teacher give there student a test five minutes after they learn the lesson. I will admit my waiter was a pretty nice guy though.  Overall, such an overrated restaurant chain.

She was right - it definitely tasted like teriyaki sauce.  The chicken was white meat, moist & very easy to cut into.  I'll definitely have it again.  My wife & daughter also enjoyed their dishes.  My daughter is vegetarian & CPK definitely has enough choices for her.  And my wife & I enjoy the rest of the menu, as well as the wine selections.  When CPK had their famous & wonderful tiramisu dessert, I looked the world over for a better tiramisu.  I...could...not...find a better tiramisu than CPKs.  I'm actually glad they discontinued it, for my waist's sake!  Love CPK & I definitely recommend it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tarzana?start=100,2.76,2.75,2.75,3.2520000000000002,2.7539999999999996

Manager (Josie) stopped by and was helpful. Fast. Friday 7pm, no waiting (it got busy later). Parked in front, though they had free valet parking available. Place is family friendly (with toddler) and cool about custom orders.  Bread was fresh, soft. Food came out right without issues. All this should be expected, but it doesn't always work out that way.

7,R.M. M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,18,,1.0,2017-09-16,"We used to come here regularly and also order take-out. The food was always great. But on Thursday night, about 20 minutes after we placed our order, we were told they had run out of pizza dough. This sent all the servers into a complete panic.  We decided to stay and just go with a salad instead of the pizza. Usually, the salads here are delicious and fresh.  We started getting irritated with the service when we had to ask three separate times to get water.  It then took about 30 additional minutes from the time we changed our order to get a sub-par salad which tasted like it was tossed with more water than dressing.  Add all that to the fact that this CPK is now holding school fundraisers every Thursday night.  The restaurant was over run by families who all know each other, giving you the feeling you just walked into a stranger's private party. We will be going somewhere else for pizza in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tarzana?start=20,3.44,2.81,2.81,,3.0620000000000003

It took 20 minutes to receive a simple drink. On top of that it took forever for our food to come out only to find hair in my pasta. I asked our server to take it back and although he offered to have them make a new one, I declined because I was grossed out and didn't feel like waiting any longer. Definitely will not return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tarzana,3.52,2.84,2.84,,3.112

The water tastes like iron. We hadn't seen our waiter or any busboy for over 20 minutes which led us to pour our own water.

Kids menu says salad and pasta, the salad never made it to the table. 2 stars at least because my daughters ordered ice tea and they didn't like it so they brought me a different drink which they were satisfied.

61,Taniel V.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,17,21.0,3.0,2017-12-30,"CPK typically has good pizzas but ordering outside of that category can be risky. I ordered a ""new"" item on the menu - roasted garlic chicken with seasonal veggies. Although the chicken looked moist on the outside, it was actually pretty dry. After a couple of bites, I had to take some of my fiancé's bbq sauce she had on the side to be able to eat some of it. I didn't even try to eat the second piece of chicken. Even with the bbq sauce it wasn't that good.  The service was good and fast. The only annoying thing was that there's only a few parking spots for self park which were all full so we had to valet. Why does CPK even offer to valet?? The valet is complimentary which is nice, but the valet driver was in casual wear and didn't look too professional. I even had to question if he was actually the employee or just some kid on the street.  I come here once in a while and will come back but probably stick with a pizza, and look for street parking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tarzana,3.44,2.94,2.94,,3.14

65,Mimi S.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,100,13.0,1.0,2018-01-02,"something is wrong with this location. Last time we ate there, we got a to go order missing salad dressing for my entree. Without knowing, I poured the oil for the bread on my salad and later realized it was not the intended dressing. When I complained they said they'd reimburse my card for the cost of the salad. However, the refund never appeared on my card and I let it go. Recently we decided to get dinner to go. When you order online, it asks you to mention any allergies. I made it very clear to avoid peanuts to do a peanut allergy. When I unpacked the bags I realized that one of the meals was not only wrong but included peanuts and peanut sauce! Thank goodness it was noticed before it was consumed. I called the store and spoke with the manager. He was very apologetic and said he'd comp the whole order. He told me if I didn't see the reverse charge in a few days to call. So after a week, I called and he assured me entered the refund and to be patient. Its been over two weeks and no refund. I hope the refund shows because I think it would be really horrible for them to claim they will reverse charges just to appease customers in the moment with no intention of actually doing so. I really don't want to have to call a third time over an extremely dangerous and negligent mistake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tarzana,3.32,2.98,2.98,,3.116

They were so sweet and had all of my food fresh and ready at the exact time I asked them to have it done. There was no wait they wanted to help walk my catering to the car!
