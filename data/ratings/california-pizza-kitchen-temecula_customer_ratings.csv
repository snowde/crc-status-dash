Yeah, our waiter was alright, for the 2 minutes of presence she oh so graced us with. It wasnt her problem though, it was the skinny noodly lookin manager that couldnt stop flirtin with all the female workers. My bf and I were watching him and damn... we both were in the restaurant industry for years and we have no clue on how the hell hes the effin manager there. Place was pretty dead and no one really looked happy up in that beeatch.

Taking care of my kids makes all the difference to me and my wife.  My wife had a kung pau spaghetti which she said was excellent.  I have to say the whole family was full and satisfied.  The bathrooms were clean too.  I feel like I've cheated myself by not coming here sooner.  We will definately be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-temecula?start=140,3.6,3.6,3.6,3.2840000000000003,3.6000000000000005

I dont understand restaurants that have salads on their menus with some type of meat and the meat comes out cold. I just pushed it aside and ate my cold pizza and the rest of my now vegetarian salad because I did not want to complain that the chicken she just brought out was cold.

Not soggy at all! Also CPK has a couch and firepit area on the patio now. It's really nice to sit outside in that area of the patio.

We had the avocado rolls for an appetizer, they were good but too greasy for a ""healthy restaurant"".  We shared the Cesar salad, which was tasty and their croutons are super yummy! The problem is they put huge pieces of shaved Parmesan on top, that you have to cut with a knife! Not the kind of work I want to put in on a salad. I had the Shrimp and Zucchini pasta on the lighter fare menu. It was very good and the shrimp were cooked perfectly! It could use more salt and seasoning, but was very good for the price.  Of course we had to order a pizza so we went with the good old standard of the BBQ chicken pizza. The hubby loves bacon, so he added it and I picked it off and put it on his slices. I am not so sure its worth the $1.50, it wasn't very good in my opinion. For drinks we had the sangria and the long island iced tea.

We're so used to eating Alfredo that this was something interesting to try. When our dish came in you can smell the spices and it already seemed tasty just by looking at it. I don't like my pasta cooked al dante but all the other ingredients made up for it. I've been craving for crawfish for quite some time (crawfish season in Dec!), so yummy. I was surprised the shrimp were big compared to most restaurants. The tails were still on, which I find a tiiiiny bit annoying so I cut them off and saved them for last :).

The 3rd meal was pasta and was just average.  I thought it was weird that our food came to us in less than 5 minutes....was it already prepared??  And I know we always have to ask for bread, which I still don't agree with.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-temecula?start=120,3.16,3.16,3.16,3.3360000000000003,3.1600000000000006

I just kept eating the bread to trick myself into thinking I got full from it.  I kept thinking how sad that I wasted $15 on a tasteless meal. But besides the Shrimp Scampi, staff was excellent and served us on time. I had no problem with waiting and they were always nice to bring us bread.

We did that $32 for two deal they had going on which gives you an appetizer, two entrees and a dessert. Sounded decent. My girlfriend and I ordered that and our friend just got an order if their crispy mac and cheese.  We got the spinach artichoke dip, my gf got their bbq chicken pizza, i got a hawaiian pizza and we ordered the key line pie for dessert. The appetizer came out and it was sadly the best part of our meal. The chips were good the dip was good so we had high hopes. Her pizza was alright, but my hawaiian pizza was just nasty. Hardly any sauce and the sauce that was on it has such a flavor that I ended up spitting it out. I ate a few pieces of the ham off the top and just decided to fill up on the dip.  Our friend who got the mac and cheese was deceived by their very poorly written menu. It described the crispy mac and cheese to have panko on top and it worded it in such a way that you would think it would just be a small thing of mac and cheese with panko on top. Nope, they tiny DENSE fried balls of mac and cheese, 4 of them on a plate with the tiniest bit of what I can only explain as cheese whiz drizzled onto the bottom of the plate. They were so small and they had so much breading that they were hard, dense and barely even had any mac and cheese in them at all. She couldn't even eat them.  Our waiter, Andrew, really needs to learn some customer service skills. He came around way too often, didn't ask us if he could take some of our empty dirty plates and he just kept asking us how everything tasted and didn't pick up on our very unenthusiastic tones as we said basically the food was meh. He hovered and just made our already disappointing dinner, awkward. We finally told him the mac and cheese things were gross after my friend asked him for the menu one more time because she wanted to read again the description of the mac and cheese she ordered. She told him that it made it sound different that what she got and that they were really gross. All he said was ""Oh... I'm sorry..."" And then hovered around for a moment before finally walking off... Like uhhhh are you going to offer us anything different or offer to take it off the menu? Nope you just walk off. But he did end up taking it off the check for us which was nice, he just kinda did it so that was nice. I dunno the quality of the food was just completely not worth the price, we got the key lime pie to go and it wasn't even good it tasted store bought. Ughh and they charge 2.99 for soda....

Last week I was invited to tag along to run the errands, and as a result found myself at CPK for a quick lunch. After a morning of running errands and shopping at the mall, we had TONS of stuff in tow and required a larger booth to accommodate all of our belongings. The hostess didn't have any problem at all seating us in a booth twice the necessary size for the amount of people we had, and we were approaching the lunch rush. Our order was taken quickly, and the food came out even faster.  I had the Sam Adams winter lager with the chipotle chicken pizza, while my wife and her friend both enjoyed the soup/sandwich option.

38,Kristine T.,"Temecula, CA",37,5,,1.0,2017-01-05,"Okay...I consider myself pretty much an expert when it comes to good pizza considering I come from the Pizza Capitol of the world NJ/NY area...I have seen 4 and five star reviews and wonder if ANY of these people even KNOW what a good pizza is. I ordered this via food delivery and granted, I will admit that I didn't expect my pizza to be piping hot...but, not even WARM?!?!? It was COLD. Just plain COLD. Pizza crust, especially super thin pizza crust is good when it has a cracker crunch. This was so chewy, my jaw hurts from trying to chew it. I swear both pizzas looked as though they were cooked, refrigerated and then cooked again.  I got the ""wild"" mushroom (false advertising much?) and there was NOTHING wild about the mushrooms on this pizza. When I think of wild mushrooms I think of boletes, Chanterelles, or matsutaki. I admit that I knew what kind of mushrooms they were before I ordered but you cannot call it a ""wild"" mushroom pizza when the mushrooms come from the nearest grocery store. But I love mushrooms so I gave the name 'wild"" a free pass.  I bought a pepperoni pizza, the mushroom and a sandwich for my daughter and the bill came to 65.00!!!!!!!!!!! For flavor, I had to add some poi ploy chili sauce and cilantro to my ""wild"" mushroom pizza. The pepperoni pizza was pitiful as well. Just plain pitiful. I don't think there was even 13.00 worth of anything having to do with this pizza. I am rarely if ever displeased with the quality of a meal at any restaurant, but these pizzas were so below par I am shocked that ANYONE would give this chain 2 stars...much less a 4 or 5 star. I have been wanting to try this place for three years now and I couldn't be more disappointed. I am thoroughly disgusted at the 65.00 I paid for the convenience of delivery. NEVER AGAIN. Sorry CPK...your delivered pizza did not deliver at all. You should take yourself right off the delivery menu.

She goes, ""Well, we close in 15 minutes."" I assured her we would be ""quick"". *Eyeroll. Our server came over like 60 seconds later and said, ""The hostess said you're ready to order."" There were still like 5 parties in the restaurant and like 10 billion servers. Ok..I'm exaggerating but you'd think in that time my daughter wouldn't have had to ask for a drink refill twice and we wouldn't have had to hunt down staff to get some napkins. My pizza literally came out burnt where I couldn't eat like an eighth of it. So sad when you're sitting there with empty drinks and greasy hands and blondie the hostess can't pipe down about her boyfriend long enough to give her server some help. Cooks off work sat with hoodies on, feet on the walls on their phone by the kitchen and servers sat at the bar while the rest of the patrons, arms flailing around, tried to get service.

I had the Halibut last time which I raved about. Chose Salmon roasted on a plank. I really was looking fwd to this dish. Salmon was not dry at all. It was roasted to my liking. No flavor, no buttery richness.  Hmmm, perhaps farm raised??? I poured the herb infused olive oil from our bread to add something to this dish. My recommendation would be to order the Halibut.

My hubby was the only one who likes peppers but he enjoyed them. Our server was very attentive and kept our drinks full and made sure we had everything we needed.  The disappointment came with our food. Bland bland bland. Pepperoni pizza was oddly sweet, my garlic chicken had little flavor, and the expensive carne asada with avocado had no flavor or balance at all. We sprinkled salt in everything and still it just felt like there was something missing from everything. The only thing we enjoyed was the avocado egg rolls.

I asked why and her reply was that there is only one cup left, now I am thinking that one cup must be very old. I asked her how long before brewing a new pot?
