We arrived and were seated pretty fast, it was around 12:30ish on a Saturday afternoon. Our server was Faith, and she was good at making sure our table was taken care of! Now about 8 years ago I found my favorite pizza, the BBQ Chicken Pizza, it changed the way I thought of pizza, no longer did I think that pizza had to have a tomato base sauce, and to this day, I still love my bbq chicken pizza to be bbq sauce, cheese, chicken, red onions & cilantro, but I noticed on the menu right under the original bbq chicken, they had an Hawaiian BBQ Chicken it's just like the original, but with fresh pineapples added to it. OMG I love the combo of chicken and pineapples, so that's what I ordered, and let me tell you, it was perfectly delicious!   I also saw they had a small dish that was White Corn Guacamole, that had sweet white corn, diced avocado, black beans, jicama, bell peppers, cilantro & serrano peppers with white & blue corn tortilla chips. Omg this small dish was perfect to share and tasted so dang good, I think I am going to have to try to make it at home.

69,Don V.,"Tucson, AZ",316,78,537.0,2.0,2013-04-09,"After a very long hot day at the art and wine festival on Mill Avenue, the GF and I decided to try a new joint (built up a pretty good appetite). Once again yelp came to the rescue. After reading many reviews about this place I was very hesitant to dine here. Seeing that we were already at the location and didn't feel like going anywhere else, we decided to get our food fix here. (Boy did I pay for that decision!). The restaurant itself is awesome, had the right lighting, the background music was loud enough to hear but low enough to hear each other talk, and it's an open bar.  After being seated, we were greeted by a very rude waitress (Britni) who took our drink order. Five or so minutes later she came back with our waters and took our order. We ordered the California club pizza and also a peach tea. Fifteen minutes rolls by and no sign of our waitress, our glasses of water were empty, haven't got the peach tea yet (starting to get annoyed). The food runner brought out our ""eye candy"" pizza, Man - O - Man it looked delicious. Keep in mind we still haven't got the peach tea yet, with our waitress nowhere to be found I waved down another waitress, who kindly stopped and asked if we needed anything.  Ask her if she could get us a side of ranch and our peach tea we ordered 20 or so minutes ago. She apologized and said she'll be right out with it. Soon after she had left ""OUR"" waitress (Britni) shows up and ask if we needed anything. In my mind I was thinking (OMG are you for reals! Where the hell have you been!). Asked her about our peach tea and asked her for a refill on my water.  She reply's back ""Oh, I totally forgot about the peach tea"".  No apology what so ever. The peach tea FINALLY came out after we were done with our pizza.To top it off she charged us for the troubled peach tea. Aside from the horrible waitress the pizza was awesome and full of flavor.  P.S. If you hate your job that much, please do us all a favor and quit.

50,ImaYelper Y.,"San Diego, CA",55,228,107.0,3.0,2013-07-18,I was checking in here and noticed the low rating they seemed to be getting and said to my husband 3 stars are they joking?  Have they tasted this food?  They cant be serious I mean have you had the BBQ chicken salad?  Have you tried the habenero pizza?   Those two items just keep us coming back but heres where things start to change and stars start to disappear.  Since Summer hit we can no longer sit outside and enjoy the patio its just too hot so we are forced inside.  The music is so incredibly loud and not just on one visit but the last 5 or 6 visits for that awesome salad we almost wanted to shoot ourselves in the head.   You couldnt have a decent conversation.  We couldnt hear each other.  We asked them to turn it down they did slightly then asked if it was ok and I said honestly no its still not ok its horrible.  They didnt turn it down any more like they should of but thankfully another song came on that wasnt as blaring.  Next few visits we noticed the music is off the charts insanely loud but we didnt want to draw more attention to ourselves we figured lets just get our salad and get the heck outta here.   The next thing that really starts to bother me is their cumbersome approach to a frequent diners card.  You sign up for the pizza dough ap and then they are supposed to load your points sometimes they load them and other times you dont get that lucky.  You have to be a pain in the butt asking about your points if they got it right etc. just not fun and tends to be embarrassing.   They have a new promo get double points til end of July or something but we never get double so they go ask management and management pushes it off on call corporate there is a number on front of pizza dough but there is only a number for them and when you call they blow you off again.   They probably would have retained that 4 star rating I initially gave if they only turn down the music and train all their employees on how pizza dough works oh and the curbside service sucks too wow do they not do a very good job of communicating.  Last two calls went horribly wrong I felt like I was on Candid Camera and these people needed me to help them do their job it was like an Abbot and Costello movie.   I call and say oh I didnt know you delivered it curbside the response is oh yes we do so I check to see if my salad is ready and she says when you pick it up and I say didnt you say you had curbside?  She says oh you want curbside?  (Its 120 degrees outside)  Yes I would like curbside.  She seemed flustered (had her on speaker) husband says screw this I will go in and pick it up.  I have called in orders twice and the communication was so bad both times we HAD to go in and pick it up rather than have them make good on their curbside service.  I guess that was maybe a very interesting way that they have come up with to get out of the 120 degree weather.  It worked!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tempe?start=60,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.8920000000000003,3.2000000000000006

The third person came at least 15min after we ordered and had to wait for our waiter to put his order in.  After about 30min from our initial order, the manager came over and said our order was ""getting sorted out""--which was the first we'd heard of an issue. Our pizzas finally all came out together, still with no apology or even acknowledgement from our waiter that there had been some kind of issue. We left Tempe Marketplace after finishing and while at another store, I realized that I didn't have my Visa from CPK. I realized that the waiter never gave it back. So I had to take our entire party back to Tempe Marketplace, park, and walk back on a 110 degree day.  When I got there, I told the woman at the front desk that the waiter hadn't returned my card. She told me to get out my ID and someone would be with me. Then she turned and did a walk through the restaurant, filling water, collecting plates, etc without telling anyone that we were waiting. Eventually, the manager came out and just handed back my card, with no apology for the waiter keeping the card to begin with.

He mentioned that he doesn't drink repeatedly and it made ordering drinks a little awkward. At one point, we ordered a lemon drop shot and we asked if he could make them. He said they had a martini and he could just pour it into two glasses. Sure. Ok. Fine. I guess that works. It turns out he made each one of us a martini in a rocks glass and charged us for two martinis. This is not what we asked for. And next time, we'll just ask for a table so the bartender who doesn't drink won't make us feel weird about ordering drinks. I believe our meal was good, I just can't get over the lemon drop shot/martini confusion.

Somewhere I would fill my face with carbs and move on to the gig. There was a 40 minute wait so I opted to be served at the bar straight away. From here on my expectations were exceeded as we had extremely fast and polite service even with the restaurant being as busy as a blue arse fly. I got the thin, crispy crust pear and blue cheese pizza which made me giggle with absolute delight as though fairies entered the restaurant and sprinkled the inside of my mouth with delicious magic dust... magic dust which actually just tasted of good pizza. The crust was very well done and made a pleasent change from the carb heavy American deep pan. Then it happened... the Quesadilla starter came out with a sauce that anyone who likes sriracha NEEDS to try. It's ranch... with... wait for it.... SRIRACHA! A mystical Asian/American spell was cast on my taste buds and I promise I will forever cast sriracha on to my ranch for the time I remain a wizard.

He never updated us on  how long our food would be after we've been waiting for 30+ mins. After we received our food, it took even longer for him to come check on us. Water refills again, our table didn't have silverware or plates or napkins. I wanted some pepper flakes for my pizza etc.  The pizza was good. I had that with the tortilla soup for the lunch combo. The soup was undesired after first try. I didn't even touch it.  The worst part about this visit was that we even told our server it was for a birthday. After they took all of our plates we were left there aimlessly waiting for at-least another 20-30 mins. The kids were getting impatient. By the time everyone started to get up to go ask for the check, Andrew came with ice cream. Set it on the table and honestly that's what we had to wait for? This place has the worst customer service and worst birthday experience anyone could ever imagine. Never again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tempe,3.8,3.43,3.43,,3.5780000000000003
13,Lloyd B.,"Chandler, AZ",48,226,1.0,2.0,2017-08-07,"Went on a Sunday evening about 7:30 with my son for a little dinner.  The restaurant was relatively quiet (customers, not noise level!)  Very noisy considering the sparse number of diners.  A five minute wait got us a table and a nice young server who was pleasant and initially attentive.  Our drinks came quickly.  We ordered an appetizer (Szechwan Chicken Dumplings) and their Sicilian regular crust Pizza.  Our server asked if we wanted our appetizer before he served the pizza and we said we did and thanked him for his suggestion.  About 15 minutes later a young lady brings our pizza and places it on the table.  When I told her we were expecting an appetizer, she offered to take the pizza back.  We were hungry and didn't care for the possibility of reheated pizza so we told her we would just keep it.  About 5 minutes later our second server returned with our appetizer which we discovered to just be tepid, probably sitting under the heat lamp for awhile.  Six small dumplings with little flavor to them.  The pizza was a bit dry, could have used more sauce and more cheese despite a fair amount of freshly grated parmesan cheese she grated directly on our pizza.  I would give it a 2.5 and the dumplings a 2 at best.  Our original server returned with our bill, my water was never refilled.  I doubt I will ever try them again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tempe,3.84,3.44,3.44,,3.6

Our waitress Tova was very helpful and welcoming :)  The side salad is so big and yummy! They have many dressing to choose from. Tova gave us great recommendations. The Champagne vinaigrette and cilantro peanut are delicious!  The thin crust spinach and artichoke pizza is a must! The portions were just right and I didn't leave with a gut bomb!! I recommend this place to anyone!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tempe,3.92,3.48,3.48,,3.656
142,Cris L.,"Glendale, AZ",101,13,1.0,4.0,2017-08-25,"So we had an interesting experience. It went from average to bad to good to average. Really up and down. I think we might've had a new server. There were 3 of us and they gave us one drink menu so we were sharing it. We placed it on the center of the table and While we were looking at it, the server just came and dropped a plate of bread right in the middle of the table on the menu we were looking at. Just drops it and walks a way. We all looked up at each other. While we were waiting for our drinks (a long time) a manager brought us an appetizer welcoming us as first timers. Still waiting for drinks. Then our food came, still waiting for drinks. Finally our drinks came, then another manager came by and offered to discount our food, we were thankful. One of the drinks was an odd one, the CPK signature drink so my friend sent it back. And ordered wine instead. Our server never came back around to ask us for more drinks or how was everything. Management did. However we managed to get another round of drinks in when he came over to leave the check which he had to reprint because he never came back to see if we wanted another round. Lol. So this is why I think the server was new. Good job to management for the follow-up and TIP: your server needs to be more aware of what's going on at each table. And pay attention to the order, example: server didn't remember who ordered what drink, drops the appetizers directly in front of each one of us without notice or excusing his reach. WE had to start moving plates around pushing water glasses to the side to make room in the middle for pizza and appetizers instead of dropping them under our noses. He was very detached. But I will say management was very attentive, apologetic and turned it around to make it a positive experience.

I'm sorry I didn't grab his name but from the second I walked in his was warm and friendly. Showed me the new items on the menu and made the extra effort later on to bring by a special treat since it had been so long since my last visit.

4,Karen B.,"Mesa, AZ",2,70,114.0,5.0,2017-10-02,I came with my 7 year old God-daughter on Saturday about 2pm.  The restaurant was slammed but they found a nice spot for us.  I really appreciated the free wi-fi so that she could play around when she got bored.  I had the GF crust with the Sicilian toppings.  The waitress was super knowledgeable about what is certified and what isn't.  Very accommodating and ensured I really understood what I ordered (Celiac wise).  The manager was very friendly when he came to check.  The Gluten Free crust was some of the best in town.  It actually had a nice crisp on it!!  My God-daughter ate the entire kids pizza!  She loved it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tempe,3.84,3.49,3.49,,3.6300000000000003
2,Manuth P.,"Tempe, AZ",0,8,1.0,5.0,2017-10-17,"Yelp Review California Pizza Kitchen 2000 E Rio Salado Pakwy Tempe, Arizona 85281 California Pizza Kitchen deserves solid 5 stars. The service I received was amazing for my Friday night with my friends. The Chicken fettucini was amazingly paired up with the amazing Raspberry Lemonade  We arrived around 6:30 pm and the restaurant was relatively packed from a Friday night. We were seated immediately. The server was really polite and very interactive with the menu. I got a Chicken Fettucini with a Raspberry lemonade for my drink. The fettucini was amazing. It was really creamy, cheesy and full of flavor. The chicken breast was perfectly cooked and full of juice. The meat was tender and full of flavor. The quality was top notched and I was not regretting getting the Chicken Fettucini. I ended my night with a Belgian Chocolate Souffle cake and let me tell you that beat all the desert I had had in my life. It was a warm chocolate cake served with Hagen Das vanilla ice cream on top, with the side of sweet whipped cream. The cake was amazing. I split it in half and there came the deliciously melted chocolate lava dripping out and it was delicious. The service was really great. Our drinks were filled up by the time we almost finished them. The server always stopped by to see if we needed anything or how good the food was. The restaurant atmosphere was amazing because the lights were dimly lit, thus giving a very relaxing atmosphere in a very crowded restaurant. The food took almost 15 mintues to get ready which is pretty reasonable for four complex dishes. They also gave us French bread served free-of-charge. The price was absolutely fair for the quality of the amazing food. My total cost was about 25 dollars, tips not included. The Chicken Fettucini cost about 13 dollars.  Overall, I was very happy with my experience with California Pizza Kitchen. The food, service, and the atmosphere were amazing and I will definitely return again.

19,Lindsey O.,"Tempe, AZ",89,1,,1.0,2017-10-19,"Service was horrible. First of all, we walked in and they were out of pizza. How does that happen? Second of all, we walked in 15 minutes prior to close, thought they closed 30 minutes later than they did. The host went to seat us and we sat down at our table and the waitress came over and told us to leave and that it was too close to closing time and then yelled at the host in front of us and then made a different server serve us. We left because it was so awkward after that. Horrible service. Worst CPK EVER!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tempe,3.76,3.54,3.54,,3.628

It was excellent as well as the herbed potatoes that accompanied it. My wife ordered a salad that was great, and the kids finished off a Hawaiian pizza. Everyone was very satisfied.

This time, s/o and I decided to get takeout. The online ordering system wasn't working (and wasn't telling us why it wasn't working), so we called in the order. We got a call 7 minutes later (which we missed, unfortunately until 20 minutes later) saying that they didn't have any of s/o's dish, so he had to switch. We get to the location 15 minutes later (as told to), and went to the takeout window, where we stood around for another 15 minutes before someone in the kitchen spotted us and got a server to talk to us. While we waited, I noticed that my pasta was just sitting out on the counter. I'm not positive they have a hot holding space, but I'm assuming they do, and I was a little disappointed my food wasn't  kept hot. S/o and I ended up getting the same thing (Kung Pao-his with spaghetti, mine with fettucine) and although mine was still good, it wasn't as good as his  the Cobb salad was bombbbb though (and I loved the beets!) I did love the little touch of having the seasoned oil in a to go container to go with the bread though :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tempe,3.72,3.62,3.62,,3.6600000000000006
