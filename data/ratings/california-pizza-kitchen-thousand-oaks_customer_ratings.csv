75,Nancy D.,"San Diego, CA",62,26,,2.0,2012-03-27,"By the looks of the other reviews, I can see that I am not the only person that has had a poor experience at the TO CPK. We went last Saturday, late afternoon. It was not busy at all. They started to seat us right next to the door, but we have been seated there before and you have to hold on to everything everytime they come in or out. So they seated us towards the back...BIG MISTAKE - out of sight, out of mind. Service was awful...a.w.f.u.l. We had to ask for everything...every time. At one point, we spilled a full glass of water. We had to go behind the counter to get a rag and clean it up ourselves...our waitress never even knew it happened.  At various times, we would ask someone that walked by for help...NEVER happened. We ordered our food...and when it finally came (over 40 minutes for the 5 of us), one pizza was luke warm (obviously had been sitting around), and my salad appeared to have been made with lettuce that had been frozen..kind of wimpy, soggy, and transparent.  We typically like CPK, but I think we will go next door to PF Changs or Claim Jumper next time we are in town. I am sure they will welcome the business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-thousand-oaks?start=160,2.7280000000000006,2.7280000000000006,2.7280000000000006,2.7280000000000006,2.728000000000001

152,Renee R.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",68,47,1.0,2.0,2012-11-04,With so many other restaurants in the area service is something that is a determining factor on if I keep going back to a restaurant.  CPK is not somewhere I will choose to spend my money in the future.  I have been to many CPK locations and the food is always decent which it was at this location too but in two different visits my order was incorrect (simply a no onion change each time).  I understand that things happen but it is how staff reacts that makes the difference. When my pizza was wrong the server admitted it and took it back to get the correct one made but my food did not come out until the rest of the party (5 people) was finished eating.  There was no urgency to get the pizza to me quickly to correct the error.  The second time we had ordered take out so there was no change that could be made.  The service both for takeout and dining was lacking and slow.  We will spend out money at one of the many other TO restaurants from now on.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-thousand-oaks?start=100,2.7920000000000007,2.7920000000000007,2.7920000000000007,2.7920000000000007,2.7920000000000007

65,Christina G.,"Agoura Hills, CA",378,2,,1.0,2012-11-20,"Absolutely TERRIBLE service. WORST restaurant experience EVER. My friends and I went ice-skating, and there were signs everywhere saying ""free kids meal after ice skating!"" Of course, we were ecstatic. We had some time before the rink opened, so we walked over and sat at the bar. We talked to a waitress by the name of Giovanna, and she told us that we had to spend $10 and we got 2 free kids meals. We didn't have time to order, but we came back after we skated. We came back, and sat in the same spot and saw the same waitress. We ordered one regular pizza, and then two kid pizzas. After the food was delivered and we had began eating, she comes over and says, ""Sorry guys, bad news. I was wrong and you only get one kids meal. So you have to pay for the other one."" Of course, we were upset. My buddy went, ""Why do WE have to pay for your mistake? We wouldn't have ordered this if you hadn't told us."" With sass, she said, ""Do you wanna speak to my manager?"" And obviously we said yes. The female manager came over and tells us she can't do anything, and then walks away. We all look at each other puzzled. Giovanna comes back and tells us we were ""lucky"" because you have to be 10 or under to get a kids meal. (If that's the case, then why let us order it?) The manager comes back and says once again we are lucky to get one free. I looked down at one of the kiddie pizzas, where I had taken one slice out of it and had one bite. I said, ""Do you want this pizza back and then make it free?"" She agreed. So she comes back and brings us the check where we only got one pizza for free. Now they tell us we can't get the other one for free because we aren't 10. Meanwhile before they told us we were LUCKY to get that deal. The VERY rude waitress says, ""Go ahead and have your mom come and bring you $5. Did you drive your Daddy's beamer here? I didn't go to college to deal with this ****."" The manager came back after we tell Giovanna we aren't paying for the pizza. Once again, I ask why we have to pay for THEIR misconception. She tells us too bad and she isn't changing it. Finally the chef comes out and I explain the whole situation. He agrees to give us both pizzas for free. The manager was standing right there and very kindly I look at her and said thank you for your help. Not even looking at me she smirked and just rolled her eyes. ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. NEVER going to a CPK AGAIN. WHY would you make the CUSTOMER PAY for your mistake? Just because we are 17 made them think they could pull one on us. If we had a parent with us, I'm sure we would have been treated with much more respect. We wouldn't have ordered the stupid pizzas if it wasn't for the waitresses misunderstanding. OH, and my friend was SICK after eating their Hawaiian Pizza. Coincidence?  NEVER go here. RUDE AND DISRESPECTFUL. They do NOT appreciate their customers. Isn't that what the business is all about?

62,Holly D.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",2,5,,1.0,2012-12-09,"For people who bought the ice rink/California Pizza Kitchen deal: BEYOND disappointed in CPK today. We had a lovely morning skating with another family today. We went to CPK afterward and asked to sit with our friends at the restaurant. By doing so, the manager would not honor our free kids meals. They considered us ""one party"" and would only allow two free kids meals. We then said we'd just sit separately then, but she still wouldn't allow it. That is totally unacceptable! Each of our families purchased these deals separately as individual groups. The fact we want to sit together should have been inconsequential. The manager's unwillingness to work with us on this caused her to lose our business today. Instead of giving each family the two free meals promised with our Conejo Deal (totaling maybe $18), they lost the business of two groups totaling probably $100. Be warned, people! Don't make this an excursion you do with friends, as CPK won't honor your Conejo Deal. HUGE mistake on their part!

Then when our lunch arrived the first employee we spoke to stated that lunch was on him....he turns out to be the General Manager (Amir K). He was generous, very concerned about our dining experience and Gracious too. He took an ordinary situation and made it extraordinary. His genuine concern for us is refreshing in a world where more and more people take no pride in their work or business.

125,Susan E.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",1,21,,5.0,2014-07-29,"My husband and I eat at least once a week at the CPK in Thousand Oaks. Their management and wait staff are superior to other local restaurants. They are consistently professional, friendly, engaging and demonstrate a very high level of personal interest in how your meal and your entire experience  turns out.  Their menu options are nicely varied and the quality and quantity of the food is excellent. So many chain restaurants rely heavily on salt and sugar to appeal to peoples' desire for a tasty meal. I have to say that CPK seasons their food perfectly and uses salt and sugar very judiciously so that I would describe their food as really well-prepared and healthy, substantial but elegant comfort food.  In particular I want to single out Emily, one of the TO store managers. She demonstrates the ideal qualities of a genuine, engaging, warm personality and a strong desire to help out her team to make sure that the customer gets exactly what s/he wants. She is an incredible asset to the restaurant.  When one small issue cropped during a visit, the general manager, Amir, stepped up to make sure we knew he was addressing our concerns, going above and beyond what we could have ever expected to make sure we were taken care of. He let us know in several ways how much our opinions and experiences mattered to him and that every single concern and suggestion was going to be included in his team management meeting.

She is not at all happy in her job clearly and I've never had such an unpleasant experience at any California pizza kitchen. I have the pizza dough reward app on my phone. I informed her when she came to take our order and gave her the check in code. She wrote it down. When the bill came, she didn't input my card. I knew I had $5 off from the rewards and I kindly asked her to add it to our bill. She told me she didn't see any reward but she would check. I told her it was on my phone. She said oh it might be something that you can only use on your next visit even though I had clearly walked into the restaurant with this reward so it would make zero sense that I would have to ""return"" to utilize it. I asked her to please check again. She never came back with info about the reward and asked us if the bill was all set as if I never had that conversation with her. I reminded her that she mentioned she was going to recheck the system for my $5 off.  She reluctantly checked. She told me the code wasn't working and to give her a phone number instead. I handed her my exact membership # and she rolled her eyes at me. Finally she came back and told us that she had found it.  And even though we had attached the credit card to the bill for her to swipe and gave her no attitude for her laziness, she managed to leave the ""signature"" portion of the check after the card has been swiped at the POS system. She came back and handed us a bill without the credit card signature authorization portion leaving both of us puzzled and frustrated. We were worried she was going to double charge after we informed her she didn't give us a signature receipt so I made sure to check the time stamps on the receipts to ensure it wasn't done twice on purpose. I would never come to her again and I believe she didn't want to honor the discount on purpose.  Also, our leftover pizza was not put in a nice box it was shoved into a little container.

I recently discovered this specific locations Curb Side Pick up and received my meals that way. The last few times tho, even after confirming my order was correct when making it over the phone, there has been a few issues. When I've picked my order up and taken it home, the order has been wrong. This happened a few times but I never said anything. A few days ago, I made an order over the phone to pick it up at Curbside and the lady that took my order confirmed everything with me twice and then told me the total at the end upon request. When I went to pick it up, the employee that brought out my order gave me a different total that was more than what the previous total that was told to me was. When I told the server he just apologized and took my card. Even though he sensed my frustration he didn't offer to compensate me for the mistake. In my opinion, when your told one thing with an order, especially the price. You don't go back on the original price your told. What if I only brought that exact amount and couldn't pay for the rest of my order? Times are hard financially and I asked the grand total in advance for a reason. After I got home and took out my order, on top of it the order was missing specific things that I confirmed with the person that took my order and reassured me nothing would be forgotten. It for sure didn't seem worth the extra dollars that I really could afford to spare. If I knew that the total was a little more than I had expected, I would have taken something out before they made everything I wanted.

I have been coming to Thousand Oaks for many many years and the food is always amazing as well as the service. Yesterday I dined in for lunch with myself and 3 others. We ordered 2 salads, and 2 pizzas. A couple of drinks and the bill was $82. I noticed that both the pizzas and salads went up in price and the salad portion is noticeably different. Is also noticed that the portion of oil in their dipping oil has also gone down. Something so minor, yet so noticeable. I know all restaurants are doing what they need to do right now, but the full size of the salads really got a lot smaller, especially with using a different bowl now instead of a plate. I just think that if you lower the portion size, then why do you need to raise the price by 1-2 dollars each item.

The managers at this location are rude, unhelpful, and are only concerned about upping sales. The last time we ate here, my mother asked for her chicken on her salad to be made fresh, not pre-marinated with garlic, because she is ALLERGIC and the manger was so rude and refused even though with pervious managers they agreed to do it with no extra charge. He only agreed to do it ""one time only"" after my father came into the restaurant and he backed down because my dad is a tall, 6 foot tall, intimidating guy. This specific CPK is not the only location that refuses to help with special orders. The fact that a restaurant refuses to make FRESH chicken that does not have bull shit sprinkled on it is disgusting. Pre-marinated, mass produced food is what is making the American people obese. In addition, the service is hit or miss. Once again, that comes down to management.

I am still a big fan of the original BBQ Chicken chopped salad, Chicken Tequila Fettuccine, BBQ Chicken pizza and the Thai Chicken pizza unfortunately for my kids and I that's about it. Those (4) dishes are clearly a solid 4 - 4.5 stars and have been the market standard and replicated on virtually what seems like most every competing restaurant menu over the years.  The downside is the franchise has become stale and the menu and overall vibe has changed along with the prices which are a joke basically $15 - $17 per which as we all know the portions are small to say the least. I really like the location in the Lakes especially when my kids were younger and now it's more of a craving issue as i'm longing for the The original BBQ Chicken chopped salad or Chicken Tequila Fettuccine otherwise there are a wealth of better overall options to choose from.

Although everything started well, we were sat promptly and the drink order was taken right away.  And then everything started going south.  The bread we requested never came until the appetizers were brought out.  Then the food order came out with two wrong dishes.  Although one was fixed, the second and most important for the toddler had to be made again.  The waitress said it would be taken off the bill and brought out right away.  After waiting another 10 minutes it was brought out but the pasta sauce was still wrong (we just ordered fettucini alfredo) so they had to remake it yet again.  At this point my son was over it since it was going on 20 over minutes and we had all finished our food at this point (which he didn't want to partake in).  After asking for the bill so we could just take everyone home since full meltdown had started, I realized we were still charged for the dish and asked what had happened.  Waitress then said taking food was up to manager discretion and i said ok that is not what had been said earlier.  So she stepped away to find manager I assume but after waiting another 10 minutes we simply had to leave.  Very disappointed especially since this location messages being family friendly.  Not if you want an unhappy family with hungry kids.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-thousand-oaks?start=100,2.88,3.21,3.21,2.148,3.078

We ordered our drinks and entrees at the same time.  We stated that 2 of us were splitting a salad and and entree as were the other two.  She asked us if we wanted bread for the table and of course we said yes. About 5 minutes later she brings our drinks and about 10 minutes after that she arrives with our entrees.  We asked her what about our salads, which you would assume would come out before the entrees, she asked, ""so you want me to send these back?""  Yes and please bring our salads.  She went and retrieved our salads, and of course we had to ask for utensils and extra plates to share.  She rolled her eyes and hurried off to get what we needed. When she returned she asked if we wanted ground pepper and I answered yes.  I served up the salads and everyone started to eat their salad.  I waited and waited for the pepper and I decided to start of my salad since I thought she forgot about it.  A few minutes later I saw her walking by with a tray of drinks for another table and then she came back to ours to offer the pepper.  As we were almost finished with our salads, she arrives with the bread she offered. Our entrees came and she brought extra plates which was nice since we were sharing, but then a few minutes later she arrives again with more plates and seemed confused that we already had plates. What really blew my mind was as we were looking over the bill, the server came by to clear my wife's plate in front of her and she placed a dirty plate that she cleared from another table on top of my wife's plate and cleared it.  I have NEVER seen that before was totally turned off by her actions. This is not the same CPK I have been going to.  Their prices are much higher and the portions are noticeably smaller.  I saw a manager walking around once, but that was it.  It seems that they are cutting back on staff, management and portions.  Very sad and I'm not sure if I will be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-thousand-oaks?start=40,2.8,3.22,3.22,2.6640000000000006,3.0520000000000005

We brought him here on a recent weeknight you thank him for helping us attack our garage clutter. We came on a night when the whole center was as quiet as I've ever seen it. Was surprised that the parking lot was so empty. No problem getting a table right away.  We sat out on the patio, even though it was in the cooler side.  I had a hard time picking a pizza, as some of the creative ones aren't on the menu any longer.  AG went for pasta with chicken, and was pleased with his choice. My traditional pizza was a bit past its prime when served, and I didn't care for the sausage that much. It was okay, but not worthy of a restaurant with ""pizza"" in its name! Best bets of the night were our server's smile and great attitude, plus the avocado/white corn guacamole, and the strawberry shortcake for dessert. The view from the patio is ever lovely - another plus. Overall, my thoughts are with the create your own pizzas for a reasonable price places abounding, traditional pizza restaurants like CPK need to step up their culinary game.  It's too expensive for what you get, in my humble opinion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-thousand-oaks,3.36,3.14,3.14,,3.2280000000000006

I told him no problem. 30 minutes later I received a call from DoorDash corporate advising that California PIZZA Kitchen had run out of PIZZA dough. Obviously, I cancelled the order. Total dumpster fire of a restaurant. If the manager had called and apologized - and not thrown out some weak excuse an hour before closing about no more pizza dough..Totally wouldn't be making my first negative Yelp review.

THE ORIGINAL BBQ CHICKEN CHOPPED SALAD = this was ok and I did enjoy the fresh crunch of the jicama, but overall, nothing special.  I also realized at home that the ranch dressing was forgotten in my to-go order.
