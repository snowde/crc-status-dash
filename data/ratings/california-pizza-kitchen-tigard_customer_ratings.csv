77,Joey Y.,"Portland, OR",115,210,17.0,3.0,2012-01-04,"My friend and I tried CPK since everything else was closed at Bridgeport. I don't like pizza. I especially don't like pizzas that are overpriced. Therefore, I don't like CPK. Yes, yes. They serve other things such as pasta and other dishes but I don't like pastas as well. So why did I go here? (Read the first sentence.) Anyways, I tried CPK many times when I was living in CA. To be honest, their pizzas are not too bad; they are just too freaking small. Their Thai and BBQ Chicken pizzas are good. Don't get the California (Something) Pizza with avocado and bacon. It's literally a baked dough with salad on top of it.  To me it's just another chain restaurant that is popular with big groups and families.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tigard?start=60,3.32,3.32,3.32,2.8600000000000003,3.3200000000000003
43,Mike B.,"Salem, OR",40,198,43.0,4.0,2012-01-15,"After seeing a movie at Bridgeport Regal, we wanted a little coffee and dessert.  CPK was right up the way, so that is where we went.  Having just gorged on two boxes of candy at the theater, I simply wanted coffee (besides, I knew my three companions would each order something different and would allow me to assist them!) My partner had their tiramisu, our companions had their butter cake and red velvet cake.  Being able to nibble on each of theirs, I couldn't decide which was better.  All three were decadent, delicious, and delectable!  You can't go wrong with any of them. Our waitstaff was engaging, and friendly and indulged our one companion with his relentless questions with ease and candor!   We were there late and stayed until after they stopped letting customers in, but it was nice to have a place to go nearby for coffee and sweets after a movie.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tigard?start=80,3.44,3.44,3.44,2.9600000000000004,3.4400000000000004

69,Mike K.,"Sheridan, OR",16,305,5.0,3.0,2012-04-26,"CPK seems to get something of a bad rap in Portland...maybe it's because California is part of the name, or because it's a big chain of restaurants, or because they seem to be placed around shopping malls, or maybe all three.  But if I just think about the food itself, nothing else, it's pretty good.  I think their thin crust pizza is just right, and there are enough varieties to be interesting.  I'm impressed by their salads too. I also like that they have a decent wine selection, and that you can get a 3 oz. or 6 oz. glass depending on how you're feeling (at most restaurants your only option is a 5 oz. glass).  Their service is spot-on, attentive but not annoying. So why only three stars?  The main reason would be the price.  Yes, the food is good but there are so many good options in this town that are so much cheaper.  It also tends to be very bright and noisy in the dining room, and I'm not a big fan of either one.  And here's the grumpy old man in me coming out, but does everyone with kids have to take them to the most expensive pizza in town?  The place was crawling with them, and I understand they have a right to be there but I would've expected fewer kids at CPK than, say, Abby's or Chuck E. Cheese...not so.   Anyway, I do enjoy the food at CPK, which is the most important (but not the only) thing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tigard?start=60,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.9880000000000004,3.2800000000000002

While I am used to waiting half an hour for a table in the Portland Area, this wait felt like an eternity. When we finally got seated, our waiter was only sub-par. While he seemed nice, it seemed like his mind was on something other than the job. I think he probably said a total of 10 words to us. The food was pretty good, but like the seating, it took forever to get to our table. I don't know, I'm not a very picky person, but I just didn't appreciate much about this restaurant. I guess all I can say for certain about this place was that I just don't think I will wait 50 minutes for a table here again. I'm pretty sure we were told 25 minutes, I don't know 30 maybe even 35 minutes would have been okay with me, but when we stood there for nearly an hour, we were just hungry and upset.

The pizza I ordered was the original BBQ chicken, which cpk should be pros at making. The pizza came on a crust that was as thin as I've ever seen. It looked like a cracker. I did not order thin crust, and original BBQ does not come on thin crust. The pizza was not even remotely warm and looked like it had been sitting for an hour.

The Thai Crunch salad is improved with warmed grilled chicken instead of the chilled chunked chicken (say that fast three times).  No complaints here--their salads are solid.  Add a star if you stick with the salads. The pepperoni pizza is also in their wheel house--my son devoured it after his 2 hour lacrosse practice (go, Aardvarks!).  The three tortilla spring rolls order was a case of poor judgment and more meh.  My husband didn't finish it, but our lacrosse player earned a few assists. The service was fine; the restaurant was busy.  I just don't like it.  Pity we were here, especially when Yelp pointed me to more interesting fare within 10 minutes of CPK.  $80 for four is a lot to pay for mediocre food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tigard,3.64,3.64,3.64,3.1480000000000006,3.6400000000000006

The food is good, even very good in some cases.  Service is good and fairly fast. Usually by cute people in their twenties or so.  The food is  of course centered on pizza.  Made on a tasty bready thin Pizza which is quite tasty and always cooked perfect for me. Also on the menu are soup, salads, entrees, my parents love the cedar plank salmon.   They also have deserts some are seasonal like the strawberry shortcake. Prices are OK and the decor is bright and modern.  In nice weather you can sit outside, they even have those directional heaters out there.  The place feels like it should be a four star.  I think the real reason I give it three instead is that it feels institutional,  while they smile and say the right things, the servers seem in a hurry.  I don't think this is the servers fault as it has been the same since they opened and at other branches I have been to,  I think it is that servers have to big an area to serve.  I have also noticed servers don't seem to last long,  I am here every couple of months and the staff always seems new.  Also everything is just so like you could be anywhere,  no real personality to the restaurant.  In all I think at the prices they charge they should be doing better at these things.  Don't get me wrong I really like the BBQ chicken pizza and I will be back but  the place is at the bottom end of my list of favorites. .

127,Anthony M.,"West Linn, OR",0,6,3.0,3.0,2015-12-12,"I tend to always write longer reivews, so in short, I will be leaving a quick paragraph for anyone looking to eat here. The bulk of my reviews are to help the managment team see their flaws and progress towards a better experience for us guests. The food was pretty good. We ordered the Spicy Chipotle pizza on thin crust, a few of the small dishes and the BBQ chicken salad for our entrées. We got the Tiramisu for dessert. I didn't enjoy the small dishes but my girlfriend and her aunt found them to be OK. The pizza we ordered was nice and I would get it again. The dessert was not that great because of the overpowering cream they lathered ontop. The waitress, who never introduced herself to my girlfriend and me, was not very inviting and didnt make the experience as great as it could've been. I will come back for pizza, but I am disappointed in the way the my waitress addressed us today.  Continuing into my longer reivew, my girlfriend and I came here to meet up with her aunt for a quick lunch date. We showed up after her aunt had already gotten seats, so we promptly walked over to where she was sitting after not being welcomed at the door. We sat down and already had waters, menus, etc. The waitress who came up to us didn't bother to learn our names or even tell us hers. She asked us if we wanted any other drinks and walked off.  When we were ready to order, the waitresses was timely on checking up on us. We got our orders in, and she left. After that, she tended to not check up on us as often as before. I actually ran out of water without recieving a fill up even after dessert came.  The food came in pretty quick, and I enjoyed the pizza. The small dishes had a lack of flavor, and I personally was expecting more. The salad was of good quality, and my girlfriend enjoyed it. Overall, we had pretty good food with a few accepting. Also, the plating was nice and clean.  My biggest concern was the customer service. Our waitress did not sell me on the experience at this California Pizza Kitchen. If I want, I can order my food to go and eat in the comfort of my own home, but going out to resturants is about the experience that you gain while eating. The food is only a small fraction of that experience. If I do not feel welcome, how can I thoroughly enjoy my food? As I stated before, the point of eating out is the customer experience, and I had a very unwelcoming and bland experience. If the team leader reads these reviews, I ask that you help your team with expanding the conversation and maybe learning the names of your guests. The key is to make us feel welcome and sell the experience along with the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tigard?start=20,3.44,3.44,3.44,3.372,3.4400000000000004

I'm usually a meat combo type guy, but I crave this pizza, the way the fresh tomatoes and fresh mozzarella come together is just perfect.

The description of the Sesame Chicken Dumplings drew me in: ""Chinese dumplings topped with sesame seeds and scallions. Served with our soy-ginger chili sauce."" I was a bit disappointed that they were steamed not fried (I found the dough a bit ""doughy"" / undercooked), and the soy-ginger chili sauce was very tasty but as it was not served on the side / rather drizzled over the dumplings I found myself mopping up the platter with one of the dumplings to get enough. I had a peach tea to go with the meal, it was fresh tea and enough peach to notice but not so heavy as to over power.  The wife had a berry sangria and we both agreed it was very, very tasty. We split a large Thai Crunch salad, with the quac on the (wife's) side.  I enjoyed the combination of elements, next time I'll ask for more won ton strips.   We also split a large potato and bacon soup - very tasty. The service was very good and we were brought some terrific crusty bread, oil and vinegar to go with the soup and salad, a really perfect pairing.  The place is really comfortable, I like the decor and felt very welcomed there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tigard,3.68,3.43,3.43,,3.5300000000000002
8,Marcus G.,"Portland, OR",0,26,13.0,3.0,2017-01-07,"I am a return customer for CPK. My go to is the BBQ chicken chop salad. The salad is great but the advertising/marketing is misleading. I was asked if I wanted a ""lunch menu"" and agreed come to find out the lunch specials are only during the week. So would you just hand me a food menu instead of leading me to believe I was eligible for a lunch special?  Also, I am not sure if there is a high demand for avacados and low supply but I was surprised to pay $3.00 for a quarter of an avocado.  All in all decent food, not the best customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tigard,3.72,3.41,3.41,,3.5340000000000003

6,Theresa C.,"Portland, OR",133,55,445.0,3.0,2017-01-16,"First of all service was great. Ordered CPK bbq pizza, and chicken lettuce wraps. The bbq pizza was good. The chicken lettuce wrap portion shrunk quite a bit from previous visits, awful. The lettuce used to be served looking just like half a head of lettuce. This time around it came neatly cut into the size of 4 wonton wrappers. Which makes a bigger mess when you top it off with chicken, and try to eat it. Please go back to your old ways, and don't mess with the lettuce. It was perfect the way it was before.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tigard,3.8,3.44,3.44,,3.584

The only issue is with parking when I order curbside, as there are no signs indicating curbside, just 10 minute parking. So you have to call back to let them know you're there. It'd be great if they had 2 signs reserved for curbside in front where they can see thru the window and monitor for customers waiting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tigard?start=20,3.84,3.5,3.5,,3.636
4,Mikhail H.,"Beaverton, OR",1528,1085,1765.0,3.0,2017-06-22,"There are two things which you should know about this place: 1.) Their food is actually damn good. I have tried many things from pizza, salads, appetizers and entrees...I have a favorite sandwich/salad combo. 2.) They have some of the world's worst service. Take out is not a bad option - just double check your order. We went here for a dinner before going to a movie. Thank God we had over two hours to kill since that was how long our food took....no exaggeration. Everything was very good. We started with a magarita pizza in lieu of an appetizer - just tell them to do that if you cannot find something awesome. I still want to try their amazing looking guac but my husband unfortunately hates guac so please give that one a go on my behalf! The pizza was grand though and they really do have a perfectly paper thin crust piled high with cheese. Next up were our entrees which took nearly an hour to get which was just crazy. Getting my correct drink took an insane amount of time - apparently I was thwarted by diet Coke! I had the halibut which was quite good. My husband did a soup and salad which he loved. I do like the amount of diversity in their menu - also that you can order based on how much food you do or don't want. We were trying to kill a lot of time before seeing a movie. Next up was strawberry shortcake ala mode...OMG, it was amazing!! Their shortcakes are skillfully made - perfectly flaky with such a great flavor!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tigard,3.84,3.5,3.5,,3.636
2,Derek I.,"Portland, OR",183,352,75.0,2.0,2017-07-13,"Uninspired and poorly executed. Come here if you want mediocre food. One of the new pastas was a strazapeti with wild mushrooms. If you really want to make it better, add shrimp. Heck, add new noodles, new sauce and all new ingredients. Throw out the original and boom - something edible.  My wife's Cajun jambalaya was mediocre and the ""sauce"" tasted like burned/charred spices. It's not worth coming here.

Got my usual petite wedge with avocado instead of bacon for lunch & was shocked when it came out to be $10, double what I'm used to. Turns out they charged me $3 for avocado without telling me. Also, didn't look up my rewards card or anything. Just handed me the bill & walked off. When I got my salad, I've never felt like I wasted my money more; especially seeing what my $3 avocado got me. With so much great food over here at reasonable prices & good portions, I wont be coming back or recommending it to clients or co-workers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tigard,3.56,3.47,3.47,,3.5060000000000002

I am so ashamed of coming here that I will never come back...please save your money and don't eat here you'll be better off at Olive Garden for some pasta and for pizza go to Bellagios.

""no really you take up serving space""  Please note this place is extremely overpriced for what you get and I was still paying.. so I don't understand why we couldn't sit, especially when the inside was almost dead.  I forgot to add a soda and he acted like it was the end of the freakin world.  Get your shit together bro.  Worst service ever. There are so many better places to eat.
