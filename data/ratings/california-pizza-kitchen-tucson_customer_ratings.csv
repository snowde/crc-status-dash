18,Steve K.,"Tucson, AZ",58,26,5.0,4.0,2012-04-19,"I was really surprised to see the run of poor reviews of this CPK at the Tucson Mall because we have had overall excellent experiences there, so I am adding my honest opinion here because I would hate to see a good place like this disappear. This review is based on our numerous experiences here over the past year and half since it opened in Tucson.  We are a family of four which includes a 3 year old and 7 year old, and on average we eat here about once or twice a month.   THE FOOD.  We try to eat as HEALTHY as possible, and when we go out, we attempt to do the same knowing that it isn't always going to happen.  In that regard, we find that CPK is a nice compromise with pretty healthy fare which also tastes fresh and clean.  For appetizers/soups, we can recommend the Lettuce Wraps, Tortilla Spring Rolls, and Artichoke and Broccoli Soup for the freshness, tastiness (without tasting overly salty or fatty), and presentation.  We also like the Korean BBQ Steak tacos.  For  those of you familiar with Korean BBQ, the steak in this dish does NOT taste like Korean BBQ.  When they first introduced this item, it tasted just like Korean BBQ, but they changed the sauce so it taste less burnt and a little more sweet and spicy.  I am Korean and I prefer the original, but this new sauce is acceptable especially when you are living in Tucson.  We do not recommend the Spinach/Artichoke Dip because it gets cold very quickly and seems to have more of a heavy buttery taste to it.  The chips were fine. For entrees, we like several of the salads including the BBQ Chicken Chopped and the Caramelized Peach.  On the BBQ Chopped, I ask for them to use about half to three-quarters of the dressing they normally would, and it suits me just fine.  Of all the pizzas, we like the Greek with Avocados sub'd in.  Their other pizzas are good too, but we like this the most because we think the fresh vegetables and make it less heavy yet very tasty.  Of their pasta/specialties dishes, we enjoy their Kung Pao Spaghetti, Asparagus & SPinach Spaghettini, and Norwegian Salmon.  The portions are not crazy big yet filling, and the flavors suit us by being good but not salty or oily.   The Kids Meals are reasonably sized and enjoyed by our children.  They come with an entree and drink.  Our 7 year old always gets the buttered noodles and shares with the 3 year old.  For the three year old, we order the artichoke and broccoli soup.  The servers count the soup as her entree and give her a free drink as well.   We haven't tried the desserts and cannot speak to that.   THE SERVICE.  I've noticed many people have complained about how poor the service is, and we have not had that experience overall.  Now, on one occasion, I had the waitress accidentally spill cold water on my right leg.  However, I did not get angry because I could tell she was flustered by how busy she was, and I could also see she was really sorry.  I think good service equates to attentiveness, and I have found that most of the servers are just that.  On our drinks,  they routinely bring out fresh refills for us and exchange our glasses before we get to the bottom.  They return to our table often enough that we do not feel like we have to wave someone down.  Lastly, when we are getting ready to leave, they offer us to-go cups with fresh refills.   Overall, we have enjoyed our experiences at CPK.    One other thing I might mention is that we have done take-out a few times, but it just doesn't feel the same.  I would recommend dining in over pick-up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tucson,3.3760000000000003,3.3760000000000003,3.3760000000000003,3.3760000000000003,3.376000000000001
43,Sarah S.,"Tucson, AZ",200,133,4.0,2.0,2012-05-25,"Not the worst meal I have ever had, but far from what I expected. My mom had eaten at the CPK in Michigan, and had been raving about their food for months. So when she moved out here, I figured I would treat her to something I knew she liked. Bad plan. Apparently the food is different from location to location, and my mom hated it here. I had never had CPK, but this location makes me never want it again. The service was slow, and my $6 wedge salad was a tiny joke, a small wedge, tomatoes, and egg.... that was it for $6. I mean I understand the idea, but I thought I would get cucumber, croutons, maybe shredded carrot... something more for the price.  But I pushed on mostly because we had already ordered our entrees. I got a spaghetti dish with chicken, and a fancy name. All it was, is noodles, bland sauce, and a small amount of chicken on top. Boring. Really I could have gotten better at Olive Garden (which is where we should have gone).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tucson?start=40,3.1440000000000006,3.1440000000000006,3.1440000000000006,3.1440000000000006,3.1440000000000006
33,Brenner T.,"Tucson, AZ",121,96,30.0,4.0,2012-06-02,"For a chain restaurant, I had a superb experience here. As Steve K. mentioned, I'm very surprised by the amount of unhappiness expressed by other Yelpers, but I guess I should add my two cents!  Came here on a Wednesday night around 7:00 and it was maybe half full, but outside patio seating seemed busier. I sat at the bar to watch the Heat vs. Celtics game (go Celtics!) and I was helped within 30 seconds of sitting down by hands down one of the friendliest bartenders I've encountered. Yes, people in this industry do need to be upbeat and positive towards customers, but I felt that she was just genuinely friendly to both myself and the other patrons. Caitlyn may have been her name, but I'm not sure..I'll edit that later if I remember. My water glass was never empty and she wasn't pushy about ordering cocktails.  I started with a Caesar and it came out promptly. Good execution, but still a basic Caesar salad. Unfortunately, I was only halfway done with my salad when the Hawaiian Barbecue Pizza I ordered came to the bar...and just sat there while I finished up my salad. Call it picky, that's fine, but I prefer spacing between courses like that.  Nevertheless, I started on the pizza and was content with my choice. Semi-crunchy thin crust and fresh toppings were abundant on the pizza and I had plenty to take home for lunch the next day. The aforementioned bartender noticed throughout my meal that I was downing water like there was no tomorrow and brought me a to go cup filled with more water. Now, that's what I call service. I left her a plentiful tip and went on my way. Maybe try the bar if you're looking for efficient service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tucson?start=20,3.408,3.408,3.408,3.408,3.408
2,Kathy N.,"Tucson, AZ",235,375,644.0,4.0,2012-07-16,"Arrived on Saturday at the Tucson Mall starving and since Choice Greens (formally Chopped) is no longer a lunch option at the mall, we decided to hit California Pizza Kitchen. Such a nice little oasis in the sea of crappy mall food! Located just outside the mall over by H&M it's far enough removed that it's almost like you're not at the mall at all. It was really packed when we arrived and had to wait in the small waiting area with a number of others, two being mothers/grandmothers with ginormous strollers that blocked the door and bench seating. Rude. We opted to eat outside and were seated within 7 or 8 minutes. The skies were all dark and gray and it was a steamy day as a monsoon was soon approaching but with the outdoor misters, the environment was cool and pleasant. Didn't wait long at all for a waitress and we decided to try out the sangrias. One red and one white: White Caribbean Sunset Sangria which is a blend of mango, apple, pinot grigio, passion fruit rum and peach schnapps and comes decorated with pineapple fronds(?), pineapple and a maraschino cherry. The Red Appleberry Sangria was raspberry, orange, lime and cranberry, merlot, Tuaca & sour apple pucker and came garnished with thin slices of green apple and limes. Both were good but the white was much more refreshing. Went with salads for lunch, just half portions which were more than enough for a lunchtime meal. In fact, there is no way we could have finished full salads. I had the Cobb with bleu cheese (added beets to the salad) and it was tasty. My dining companion had the Waldorf with the Dijon balsamic vinaigrette. Both salads were fresh and delicious but nothing to write about (ha! Punny....since I'm writing about them!). Next time I'll try one of the more interesting selections. All in all, a nice dining experience. Service was attentive without being obnoxious and the outdoor patio dining was a welcome retreat from the hustle and bustle both inside the restaurant as well as inside the mall. Next time (yes, I'd go back) I think I might have to try the cranberry walnut chicken salad sandwich and a refreshing Paloma!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tucson,3.44,3.44,3.44,3.44,3.4400000000000004
5,Lauren T.,"Tucson, AZ",160,275,24.0,2.0,2012-08-02,"I hadn't been to California Pizza Kitchen in years, but it seems that since I have been, they have changed their menu. I used to love and and now it is just pretty pricey for the quality of pizza. I got the white pizza with the smoked applewood bacon and it was probably the worst white pizza that I have ever had. Their bread from their mini menu was good. They did a fair job on refilling my water but other then that, not even their service was exceptional.  I say skip. There is better pizza here in Tucson.

15,Saba B.,"Tucson, AZ",371,431,81.0,3.0,2013-01-14,"I enter mall mega-chains with extreme trepidation, and I can safely say that CPK isn't as bad as some of the other mallstrosities, although watching  teen shoppers traipse in and out of H & M is an ambience killer. My partner had a gift card though, so we had nothing to lose. His chicken piccatta was actually tender, moist, and lemony with spaghettini on the side rich with capers and lightly oiled. My roasted veggie salad was huge even though I ordered a half, and whoever manned the grill left them just crisp enough to add pop. The service is sharp, although they must be trained to turn over tables at a blinding rate because we must have been asked if we were ready to order five or six times when we hadn't even glanced at the menu. CPK's does the corporate pizza to specs, and the constant mob at the door can't be wrong.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tucson,2.84,2.84,2.84,3.372,2.84

Although a chain, it's chain done right.  I can't wait to go back and try the pizza and other items.  I definitely recommend for catering.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tucson?start=20,2.88,2.88,2.88,3.604,2.88

My friend brought me here as a late birthday present lunch and I had a great great time.The server was friendly and answered any question I had about the menu and she was quite humorous as well. I started off with an appetizer of chicken lettuce wraps and that was mighty tasty! It had a great dipping sauce that went along with it which was nice creamy and sweat but not too sweat. The chicken was cooked right and didn't have too much of an overpowering taste of the water chestnuts. As my main entree I ordered a Shrimp Zucchini, Fettuccine pasta! Try saying that 5 times fast! That was also delicious! The shrimp wasn't over cooked and still had it's flavored the the Zucchini was thinly sliced into the pasta so it was like you were eating the pasta with zucchini noodles. Which tasted great and was cooked pretty well to taste. As my beverage I enjoyed a full body 8oz of red wine of Melbot which went perfectly with my dish, Next time I want to the their own red wine that they brew which a story lies behind it about a surgeon who created that wine. So hopefully my next visit I will be able to try that wine and actually hit a pizza dish since it is called a pizza kitchen!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tucson?start=20,3.04,3.04,3.04,3.54,3.0400000000000005

12,Ashley J.,"Tucson, AZ",67,310,214.0,3.0,2013-04-29,"I love the CPK pizzas, and I've dined-in at different locations, but yesterday was my first time to try this location, here in Tucson. And??? Not impressed. They had a big sign out front boasting ""We're more than just pizza!"" so I thought - why not? Lets try something else (my usual is a salad & pizza that I split with the hubbs). We started with the ""avocado"" egg rolls. I say it in quotations because it should have been called ""chicken"" egg rolls. Seriously. there was a teeny, tiny sliver of avocado that you couldn't even taste because it was overpowered by the chicken. Tasted okay (I'd give it a B+ grade), but nothing spectacular and certainly not what I was expecting since I thought it would be predominantly avocado (silly me!) For my entree I asked the waitress for her recommendation. I wanted tacos but there were a couple different types and I was torn between fish tacos (mahi mahi) and carnitas tacos. She said to go with the carnitas, for sure. The conviction made me think they must be stellar. Unfortunately when they came out....not so much. Honestly, the meat tasted like it'd been cooked 3 days prior and had just been sitting there in the back. Not fresh or juicy like carnitas are supposed to be. Really, it tasted like more chicken that had been cooked in some sort of flavoring packet (carnitas is supposed to be pork!) It was very disappointing. I'd give it a C- grade. Finally, the beverages.... I was excited because their menu boasted ""fresh squeezed lemonade"" with various flavors. I LOVE fresh lemonade so I was all over it! Well, if by ""fresh"" they mean ""fresh from Minute Maid"" then maybe I'd agree. Definitely did NOT taste fresh at all (no lemon pulp or anything that would hint that it was truly freshly squeezed). Additionally, all the flavors were nothing but syrup - no real fruit at all. I tried a strawberry lemonade then switched to raspberry lemonade for my refill and both just tasted like straight sugar-syrup. Very disappointing (a grade of C or C+ at best). Overall I'd say - stick to the pizza. That's what they know how to do and thats what they do best. Although I also have to say that when I've visited other locations I've had a very different experience so maybe these problems are exclusive to JUST this location. Either way - if you're trying something other than pizza, order at your own risk!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tucson,3.28,3.28,3.28,,3.2800000000000002

I found a server and told her we needed to order food. Finally the manager came out as we had been there about 20 minutes sitting alone not to mention already being there just waiting for a table.  She apologized profusely and offered up an appetizer. we accepted. She came back with fish crackers for the children and advised that it was not good that we were there for 20 minutes and had not even been able to order. After that it was quick and the food was good but we can't make children wait that long.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tucson,3.8,3.8,3.8,,3.8

0,Christina C.,"Tucson, AZ",27,123,38.0,4.0,2014-08-04,"My experience at this location has always been great. We had such a great experience at the bar one time. I believe his name was Jose, my apologies if I am wrong. He was very attentive and knowledgeable of the menu. I decided to eat here on my birthday and we had another server who was great and made great recommendations. Although this is a chain pizza place and can be a little pricy, I really enjoy the atmosphere and staff.  I used to really enjoy the BLT Pizza which is no longer on the menu, but if you ask nicely they can make it for you. :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tucson,3.84,3.84,3.84,,3.84

14,Patti C.,"Tucson, AZ",6,54,36.0,3.0,2014-10-15,My husband and I went here on a Saturday night. Our server was very attentive and quick to refill our drinks. We were offered a free appetizer if we filled out a form. We choose one of the flat breads. It was very good. I had the veggie pizza and my hubby has a spicy pasta dish which he said was good. I am only giving 3 stars because it is a chain and the food wasn't amazing.Would I go back again? Yes.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tucson,3.8,3.8,3.8,,3.8
