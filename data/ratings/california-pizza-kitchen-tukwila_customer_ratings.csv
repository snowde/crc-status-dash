To start off we ordered the guac+chips(pretty good, not enough avocado) off the small cravings menu which was decently priced at $4.  Our main dishes consisted of the pesto chicken pasta(yum!), tequila fettucine, chicken picatta, and bbq chicken pizza.  All of which tasted grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreat!! So far, all of the food I've had here has been pretty on point with no complaints...  but I do feel that their menu items, other than the pizza are slightly over priced in comparision to the serving size you recieve.  The quality of the food however has never been an issue.

A little spicy to be honest. I do think it is slightly over priced. I could be wrong. Service: My waiter provided good service. Made sure my drink was refilled.

This is a good place to go if you're craving upscale modern fare... from pizzas, to salads, to pastas, this place has something for everyone. My personal favorites include: BBQ chicken chopped salad, Hawaiian BBQ chicken pizza, mushroom ravioli, spinach and artichoke dip, white pizza, wild mushroom pizza, and their tostada pizza.  If you're into desserts, try the tiramisu or butter cake!! Totally worth it... just make sure to plan a few extra hours at the gym!  My only complaint is about the prices! CPK is expensive for what it is!! I'd say on average you should expect to spend $20-$25 per person... add some adult beverages and an appetizer to that, and your looking at $30-$35 easy.  P.S.

I really like this location since it is near everything and anything, plus it has easy parking. I ordered the usual tostada pizza, and the wife ordered a the classic BBQ chicken pizza. OMG, I was in heaven. Since I had it last, they made slight adjustments to the tostada pizza, that made it even better. It is a thin crust pizza/with a salad on top. Brilliant. The BBQ chicken pizza had the right amount of BBQ sauce, and plenty of chicken, which made it a great choice.  We usually order the Tiramisu bc it is simply amazing, but the waitress convinced us to try one of their seasonal desserts...salted caramel pudding. I died and went to heaven, bc this bite sized dessert was incredible. To be honest, you should probably skip the pizzas, sandwiches, and salads, and go straight to dessert.

I highly recommend getting something different from the classic pepperoni. The weirder, the better. Their pizza with black beans and tortilla strips is surprisingly good and was actually way better than the one I tried with pepperoni and black olives. The dessert is a pretty high quality number, as well. We tried some sort of molten chocolate cake that was actually better than the pizza.

I wanted to do something special today so I was determined to come to CPK.  I asked to see what options I'd have there. They came up with a huge menu of options I hadn't considered and pointed out that it's fine also to have any pizza without cheese. I asked which one would be the best option for that, and they mentioned the spinach artichoke pizza.  The pizza itself was delicious! I hadn't had a pizza in my hand in years, and it felt like I got to be a part of the club again. The service was also incredible. When they first came out with the pizza, the waiter mentioned he thought half of the pizza was a little burnt. To me, I didn't see it, but I shrugged and he said he already was having them make a new pizza. I got to keep the first one.

Our server acted like she didn't want to be there at all; she took my menu away from me while I WAS STILL ORDERING, because apparently since we'd NEVER been there, and I was having a slightly hard time deciding what I wanted, meant that we must have just put her out of her way so much, because I needed one extra minute to order.

First of all why would you come all the way to our table and give us cocktail napkins but no water!!! I was so annoyed with their service!! Then our server shows up and it's not the person she had pointed out earlier. Andy was really nice and apologized for the wait, which was not his fault because he just got on shift. We ordered our food, Kung pao spaghetti fettuccine with mushrooms and a BBQ chopped salad. Our salad comes and I had to ask for bread, really!! The bread came with and herb oil which tastes bitter so I had asked for butter, then our pasta comes out, and my Kung pao was great, but my husbands pasta was not cooked fully, still very hard in the center, and the cream sauce was non existence!!! We sent it back and decided not to order another dish. It was so disappointing! Then the executive chef came out to apologize and offered us a free dessert, he was really nice and understanding. The staff on the other hand is a different story! They need to go back and start their training, I have never been to a cpk that has this bad of service, and they weren't busy at all! No one was around, they just come and drop off your food and disappear! FAILED!!

Why do I bring this up?  Well, for some reason, American corporate chain restaurants--capable as they sometimes are of delivering exceptional values--often fail abysmally in hospitality. Here the restaurant was only two-thirds full, but there was still a ten-minute wait to be seated--caused in part by a lineup of families at the door.  When the host finally walked me over to a booth, he simply tossed the menu onto the table top and walked away.   To my surprise, when I put my hand down to pick up the menu, it came up smeared with oil.  No one had bothered to wipe the table top.  And too bad I didn't bring a dog with me, because there was enough food on the floor beneath the table for a second meal. Perhaps serving jobs are made too easy nowadays.  Maybe they've been broken down into smaller and smaller domains of responsibility--like a Japanese department store with more attendants than shoppers.  I mean, something must account for the dismal boredom that I repeatedly encounter in the serving staff in such places. To be fair, the food at Tukwila California Pizza Kitchen was okay.  I had a half Caesar salad and a Margherita thin-crust pizza, which, along with a bottomless soda and a 20% tip, came to $30.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tukwila?start=40,3.32,3.32,3.32,3.2760000000000007,3.3200000000000003

I go in and there wasn't anyone in the waiting area, the place wasn't even full and she told me to wait, which was fine. Well I waited longer than expected for a place that was not busy at the moment. Once she came to back she asked if I wanted to sit indoor or outside, and I said indoor, she then grabbed the menus and walked off, she didn't even say a word. So the other guy who was there don't remember his name it started with K, said ""oh, I think she means to follow her"" and well I responded with, ""well she didn't say anything to me"". She literally just walked away.  Once I got seated she didn't even make eye contact and didn't say anything until I said thank you. The other waiter ""K"" came and apologized saying its her fist time out on the floor and she is usually in the kitchen. So sweet of him to try to cover for her, but I think it was BS, I didn't buy it at all.   ""K"" took over after that which was good, because the other one looked she was not having a good day or something. He took care of us which was good and the food was really tasty, I got the chicken chimichuri, and didn't even get a chance to take a picture because I got a call about a family emergency.

Every time I come here, (normally in the evenings on a Friday or Saturday), there is hardly ever a wait! If anything, we would have to wait for less than 5 minutes. Which is a major bonus because who likes waiting for more than 15mins to get seated on the weekend after a long week? The people up front are always very nice and greet us when we enter and leave. But as for waiters, it's a hit or miss. Last week, was a bad experience which was such a disappoint. After we were seated, it took our waiter about 10 minutes to come to our table and finally get our drinks by that point we were already ready to order. He didn't really have an explanation or apologize for the wait (which I think is a bit rude). The last few times we have came we have gotten complimentary bread and this time we didn't. But the table next to us did? Hmm...  Once we got our food, he didn't check on us at all throughout our dinner. When we asked for our checked, he had it ready already. Hmm... what if we wanted dessert? I don't know but I really did not like the waiter that we had.

My mom wanted to go here for her birthday. I can think of other places I would rather go for a birthday, but it was her birthday. We walk in and get greeted by the hostess. We are then greeted by Elizabeth who proceeded to show us to our table. Enroute to our table my Mom asked if our party of four could sit at the corner booth. Elizabeth was quick to say, ""No, I'm sorry but corner booths are for parties of five."" Mind you, this was during a week day. They were not busy, but I took her word for it. Being it's my Mom's birthday I was a bit irritated so I said, ""Maybe we bring five people on your next birthday."" Before walking away Elizabeth says, ""Oh, happy birthday."" We sit down and get settled in to look at our menus. This whole time while looking at the menu I periodically look around the restaurant and I eventually notice a family of four sitting in a corner booth. I tried not to be too obvious, but I kept looking over to see if there was a small child in the party, or maybe someone happened to be using the restroom when I initially looked over there. Time passes and I realize it's just a party of four in a corner booth. I think to myself, ""Okay, maybe the corner booth we requested is their last booth to seat a party of five."" Though there are several tables that have five chairs and place settings for parties of five. We eventually decide on meal choices and place our orders, and while we wait the nice hostess that initially greeted us walks by with a party of four. I turn to see where this party of four is being seated, lo and behold they get seated in the corner booth my Mom requested. At this point I am upset and plan on talking with Elizabeth before leaving to express my displeasure.  We eventually get our food, which was okay, nothing special. My mom got the Thai Salad that she was craving, my better half got a salad and Mac & Cheese, our little girl a Pepperoni Pizza, and I got the BBQ Chicken Pizza. Again, the food was okay. I have nothing bad to say about the quality of our meal. As we are leaving my Mom tells me that she would like to talk with Elizabeth. I think Mom could tell I was quite upset, and chose to be the one to voice our dissatisfaction. We walk to the front and ask the hostess if we could speak to the manager Elizabeth. She said she would get her right away. As Elizabeth walks over toward the front my Mom confronts her, they exchange words and they then part ways. I asked​ my mom what was said. My mom then told me that she told Elizabeth that we noticed other parties of four that were seated in the corner booths, and that we were unhappy with being told one thing and seeing another. My Mom then told me that the only thing Elizabeth said about our concern was, ""I understand."" I truly hope she ""understands"" that she could have made my Mom's birthday dinner better by either letting her sit in that corner booth, or at least be consistent when saying, ""the corner booths are for parties of five."" Or, just a simple ""I'm sorry"" would have been nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tukwila,3.4,3.49,3.49,,3.454
21,Molly C.,"Kent, WA",21,6,,5.0,2017-03-21,"CPK has the best food in the Tukwila area. I work here, but if I'm going out to dinner I'm going to CPK other places just aren't worth the money. When you come be sure to try the Avocado Rolls, Lettuce Wraps, Jamaican Jerk, California Club Pizza and for dessert you can't go wrong with Butter Cake. Sign up for our rewards program and get a free small plate-I highly recommend the Buffalo Cauliflower. Come give us a try you won't be disappointed!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tukwila?start=20,3.4,3.52,3.52,,3.4720000000000004

8,Tim M.,"Tacoma, WA",3,98,21.0,3.0,2017-05-23,"My first experience with the CPK chain. This is one of those places I've been meaning to try for a very long time but just never found myself in the right ""location"" to make it happen. First, let me say that the place was EXTREMELY loud. I'm not sure how anyone could have a conversation in here. I know my fellow diner and I really couldn't. It was that loud. Just WAY too loud. I'm not real sure why, but it's a VERY loud space that does not attribute to any conversation at normal volume levels. I'll follow that up with this: Upon being greeted by the hostess, I inquired about sitting outside since it was the first sunny day we've had in the Seattle area in something like 8 years or whatever (It may not have been 8 years, but it sure feels like it. If you've been here, you know.). She informed me that she could not seat us outside because there was only one server working that area and, I quote - ""She's pretty stressed out right now."" :-/ Fine, whatever, just give me a table in this venue with the volume levels of a rock concert. Based on those two items alone, I'm not sure I'll be returning here any time soon. I give it a 3 star rating because the food was okay. Granted, I didn't order a pizza, even though that is the namesake. But they do offer a lot more than just pizzas. I wouldn't call the food great, but it wasn't bad either. Not sure I'm really a fan. I think I can find other dining options that are better than this at this price point. Your mileage may vary.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tukwila,3.36,3.51,3.51,,3.45
4,Dee C.,"Port Orchard, WA",80,45,56.0,4.0,2017-06-03,"It's been awhile since I've been to CPK, actually since I've been home in Hawaii. It's always been my favorite place to dine and because we were at Westfield mall, we decided to stop in. Surprisingly it wasnt busy for a holiday since there wasn't any wait so we were seated almost immediately.  Our server , i believe his name was Evan, provided such awesome service and Always made sure we were helped.  I ordered my usual, garlic cream fettuccine with shrimp as well as spinach artichoke dip. My fiancé ordered a lettuce wrap and a pizza. CPK never seems to fail when it comes to their pastas and dip. They offer a wide variety of appetizers, salads pastas and pizzas.  I would definitely recommend this place if you haven't tried it yet. It's such a bummer they don't have many locations open in different cities of WA considering the 4 stars given, I'm sure they'd have more business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tukwila,3.48,3.51,3.51,,3.498

1,Maggie S.,"Seattle, WA",1,24,31.0,4.0,2017-08-23,"I am a fan of Ma' & Pa' pizza places so I was not excited to try a chain pizza restaurant, but from the moment I sat down I was impressed with California Pizza Kitchen. The menu is huge and delicious looking. The staff at this particular place was very friendly. After sitting down, the manager came out with a free app, insisting we try their guacamole and chips on the house since it was our first time in! It was fantastic. The worst part of the whole experience was trying to pick only one thing to order for myself.  Once we ordered, they brought out delicious  free bread and amazing oil for dipping. They were also very helpful with my mother-in-law's food allergies. She ordered a Margarita Pizza, while my partner and I shared the Sicilian Pizza and the California Salad.  I am giving them 4/5 stars only because I didn't think my salad was worth menu price at $16.00. I have had better salads for less. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but $16.00 is too much for a salad. For all three of us, the bill came to about $50 without any drinks. Which is a little high, but also take into consideration that this is really close to Seattle. **but this location was not in Seattle.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tukwila,3.48,3.52,3.52,,3.5040000000000004
