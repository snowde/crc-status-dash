77,Matt R.,"Orange County, CA",20,419,238.0,3.0,2012-05-14,"Am I in a restaurant, or a nursing home? Holy cow, I know this isn't as popular as it used to be, but I felt like I was eating at Sizzler during the early bird special. I felt embarrassed ordering multiple alcoholic beverages, like someone was going to tell me to 'keep it down, Sonny!' I really hate their pizza. Why the hell would you take a perfectly normal pizza and dump a completely unrelated dish on top of it, like a salad? I think if you look at their menu you'd find pork lo mein pizza, BBQ rack of rib pizza, fondue pizza, fish and chips pizza, strawberry yogurt pizza, need I go on? Yuck! Had a couple of their small cravings (appetizers) which were pretty good. Also very cheap. I had the mac & cheese bites, quesadillas and korean tacos. All were pretty good, and pretty cheap. Tiny portions, but I like that, especially if priced correctly. I had the tequila chicken alfredo pasta. It was good, but a little on the bland side. My wife had the carnitas pizza. It was good, but again, putting all that weird crap on a pizza isn't my idea of anything more than a novelty. At least everything was priced reasonable. I think even the pizza was under $10. We even got a decent bottle of wine for $20. The bartender was heavy handed with the jack on my jack and coke, as well. Big points for that. All in all, it's kind of hard to enjoy much of anything in a restaurant that's really not much nicer than Denny's decor. The yellow color inside is closer to orange, which really makes it feel even older.  IF I came back here I would have to sit at the bar. The bar seems a little less like a family dining area and a little more casual and modern. Unfortunately, the night we were there, the bar was packed and the tables, all empty. I'd return, but I'm not particularly excited about it.

We came here for lunch right when it opened at 11:00a on a Friday.  My kids ordered the curly mac 'n' cheese that came with a beverage with free refills ($5.50), and my sister and I shared the full size roasted vegetable salad ($13.25) and the roasted garlic chicken pizza ($12.25).  I usually try not to order anything garlicky during the day, but I couldn't find a pizza that I really wanted to try.  Besides, I wasn't planning on seeing any friends later, so it was all good. The pizza was good, the salad was okay.  My kids' mac 'n' cheese was bland (which was probably better for them).  All in all, everything was okay, yet still on the pricey side, just like I remembered from when I ate here years and years ago (yay for coupon), but I gave them an extra 1/2 star for their friendly service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tustin?start=80,3.4,3.4,3.4,2.8280000000000003,3.4000000000000004

The only ""gripe"" I have is a result of what I like..they're consistent but also very rigid in how they prepare/view a variation to a meal. While their food is very fresh, it is also measured to the ounce and in small baggies to ensure that all portions are the same. Big deal? Nah...but my wife has a challenging diet and removes a ton of things from her favorite salads and I mentioned to the server (who was a bit arrogant) that it'd be nice if she could have a bit more of what she did retain on the salad....well, they didn't and she received the salad sans all the things she can't eat with the typical 1 ounce baggie portion of what she could eat....all for the same price. So if a salad has a 7 baggie combo and you eliminate 5 of those baggies...could you maybe get an extra baggie or two fo the two you're keeping?? I mean if they're just vegetables and no hard cost...would it kill you or does the binder you're ""chef's"" read keep it so strict that you can't physically pull one more ounce out of the pre-made bin? I made another comment to the server that ""could she get a few more beans?"" in her salad and he smiled, walked away...never to return again but towards the end for any desert requests.

While their pizza was pretty decent (while terribly greasy.. even w/o meat) their service was absolutely horrible. The hostess was not at the stand at the time when we arrived, and failed to present us with the slightest smile nor friendliness. There were plenty of tables available but hardly any place to wait. We sat down after waiting for about 10 minutes and were greeted by a less than stoked server. We enjoyed their tuscan hummus as a starter. The Tuscan Hummus was creamier than their grecian counterparts as I believe this was made with a starchier white bean as opposed to the usual chickpeas. (loads more oil as well) Try it with their whole wheat pita, its a chewy delight!  We also ordered their crispy thin margarita pizza which was ridiculously oily, and soft. The pizza wasn't erect, it was more.. floppy.. Which was okay.. Probably laden with grease. If you order a pizza, you're guaranteed to be stuffed to the brim, I advise that you share it! Overall, the food was OKAY but the service was bad. Our server was not friendly, she did not refill our drinks a single time, and only checked up on us once.

55,Rob L.,"Irvine, CA",4739,412,1621.0,3.0,2013-10-20,"We have always been a fan of CPK and this is our first time visiting the one in The Market Place in Tustin.  This review is for THIS particular location only. THAI CRUNCH SALAD:  A very nice blend of napa cabbage, cilantro, and other greens mixed with nuts and rice sticks and tossed in a very tasty Thai peanut dressing.  The dressing was rich but it didn't overwhelm the freshness of the salad.  It is a crunchy kind of salad, so if that's what you crave, you'll love it. Hot! WILD MUSHROOM PIZZA:  Amazing!  It was topped with an exotic mix of mushrooms such as Shitake and Portobello, and the pizza had a very rich mushroom aroma which was every mushroom lover's dream.  This is how you differentiate a good pizza from a great one - the aroma.  You can smell the flavor of the ingredients.  Hot! SERVICE:  Our server has been excellent throughout.  He has been attentive, courteous and helpful.  Our iced tea and water was never empty.  When we told him that we were sharing the salad and the pizza, he gave us a choice of serving us the salad first and then the pizza, or serving both items at the same time.  We opted to have the salad first and then the pizza.  Awesome! So, now you ask, what is the difference between 3 stars and 4 stars?  The answer:  How a restaurant is willing to accommodate special requests from a customer. We requested the Thai crunch salad without cilantro and the server said all the salads are pre-mixed and that cannot be done.  And he was really apologetic about it.  Note:  This is NOT the server's fault.  There is nothing that he can do about it.  It is the restaurant's policy or the setup of the kitchen that they cannot accommodate such a simple request.  We have been to a CPK in the San Diego area, ordered the exact same salad with the special request of no cilantro and there was no problem.  I guess the kitchen there was willing to make a separate batch of salad for us. And that is precisely the difference between a 3-star restaurant and a 4-star restaurant.  A 4-star restaurant would have happily and easily accommodated such a simple request.  A 3-star restaurant is either unwilling or unable to do so.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tustin?start=60,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.2199999999999998,3.1600000000000006

Love their salads such as the Cobb and the Roasted Veggie. Recently I fell in love with the Arugula and Quinoa Salad with Chicken. YUM. As for pasta if I'm feeling a rebellious (from my diet) I will go for the Kung Pao Spaghetti and you just CAN'T pass up the Spinach and Artichoke Dip. Take-out during weekday lunch hours can be a little hectic as everyone crowds at the counter area trying to pick up their order. One time I waited at the counter for 15 minutes trying to pick up 1 salad.... wasn't happy about that! What I give them props for is they are really fast with getting the order ready.

48,Charles C.,"Irvine, CA",13,252,131.0,2.0,2015-06-08,"To start off with, one of the biggest pet peeves I have with restaurants is when the appetizers are brought out and then the food comes out right after it.  To avoid this problem, I usually stagger the order because chain restaurants like CPK tend to ""Cattle"" you in and out and they really don't care about the dining experience.  Nobody wants a table full of food all run out at the same time.   Case in point:  My wife and I dined here Sunday 8/7/15 at approximately 6PM and had no problems getting a table since it was pretty quiet which was surprising for a Sunday dining time.  We sat in the furthest corner booth and our waiter was Philip.  Philip was nice and engaging.  We ordered the Hummus and a Caesar Salad to split.  We put the order in and then waiting another 10 minutes to order our entree's which were the Jambalaya and Zucchini Fettuccini.  They were run out by a food runner a little late but it wasn't too bad. We made it through about half of our appetizers when another food runner brought out our entree's.  This is a clear operations problem because Philip was nowhere to be seen throughout our meal except to let me know he would bring me another water which, by the way never came until the end of the meal followed by 4-5 apologies.  There was no problem getting the check quickly though.  I would assume that this happened because they needed the table.  The main problem here is a complete lack of communication between the server, the kitchen and the runners.  We essentially had to make a choice of finishing our appetizers and letting our food get cold or opt into our main course and leave the rest of the appetizers.  We opted for the latter alternative which resulted in us wasting about 50% of our appetizers.     The competition for dining in this corridor is becoming very intense with several new restaurants planned like Taps, Daves BBQ and Wokcano plus the new Mizu Sushi Bar and Grill already in place.  Establishments like CPK need to up their game if they are going to compete and operational excellence is probably the easiest thing to accomplish if they put some time into it.  Again, this place was nowhere near capacity so this should not have happened.  The Irvine Companies seem to have no problem with removing stores that don't fit the profile they are trying to achieve here and several chains have been essentially told to seek business elsewhere like On The Border and Buca Di Beppo.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tustin?start=60,2.96,3.11,3.11,3.208,3.05

I'm talking one of those 'wow' service experiences that are so on point that I wanted to stay there all night. My wife and I went to dinner there last night and we went right in the thick of a Friday night dinner rush. The wait was about 20 minutes, which wasn't too bad considering how busy it was. We were sat at the same time as party of 9 (5 of which were young children) right by us. Not a big deal, but just to put a bit of perspective on the situation, we had the same server as that party.    Then our server, Phillip, walked up. He was fun, witty, professional, had a sense of urgency - if I owned a restaurant I would want an entire staff of him. He was able to suggest good drinks, walk us through the appetizers without being pushy or trying to sell us on anything and just made the dining experience better than most. His timing was on point; his table presence was warm and fun. He made quite the positive first impression.  To reiterate, California Pizza Kitchen, being a corporate chain, has the same food at every location - which is good food. The reason for the 5 star review is because of our server Phillip and his amazing customer service and table side presence.

Service was good.  Now they offer shredded parm for your meal instead of the powdered cheese shaker on the table.  Free refills on milk for the kids is a nice bonus.  Overall, it's decent for a chain, though I feel like the prices are higher than before.  I'd give it a 3.5 if there were half stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tustin?start=40,3.72,3.2,3.2,3.0520000000000005,3.408000000000001

The food was nothing spectacular. Average at most, but I expected that going into it.  My review is solely based off of the service that my table received from our waitress. She was pushy, impersonable and she made us feel like we had to rush to eat our food and pay.  Initially, I wasn't going to write this review, but by the time we ended our lunch, I was so irritated that I deemed it necessary.  My first issue was that our waitress seemed upset that she even had to take our order just by her demeanor. Secondly, when I placed my order with her she reached over me to grab the menu (she couldn't be patient enough for me to hand it back to her) and her sleeve from her shirt was on my bread plate/bread. The main issue that stuck out to me the most was when she put the bill on our table. We didn't look at the bill right away because I literally just finished my food. Then our waitress comes back to our table after 3-4 minutes and says, ""I'm off shift in five minutes so are you going to pay the bill?"" In all of the restaurants I've been to, I've always had a server introduce another server to take over their shift instead of interrupting a conversation in a rude manner to pay the bill.

What does any of this have to do with CPK?  I'm almost there - I dropping my car off on a Thursday evening for its 2nd visit to Tustin Mazda for what turned out to be the ""Engine"" warning light (it would have been too easy for Mazda to have the idiot light say that; instead you get a picture that looks like a small red fan).  On my first visit the previous week, they figured out that particular idiot light meant I needed a new oxygen sensor (isn't it obvious?).  They didn't have the part in stock, so I had to make another appointment.  It was the night before that appointment.  I had just dropped my car off and was driving a loaner; it was dinnertime and I was famished.  I asked Yelp where the nearest pizza could be found, and it brought me here to CPK. I arrived around 5pm; it was my very first visit ever to CPK.  The interior was cheerful, not particularly crowded, and refreshingly cool after the scorching, atypical June temperature.  I asked for and was taken to a booth; my server Justine appeared almost instantly and gave me a menu.  I asked her about the draft beer selection, and requested three tastes.  Justine made that happen and brought me some warm, complimentary bread and oil faster than bi-partisan cooperation vanishes in an election year. Having narrowed my pizza choice down to two, I consulted with Justine about the choice of pizza and crust style.  She convinced me to go with the thin crust Sicilian (Spicy marinara, Italian sausage, spicy Capicola ham, salami, Mozzarella, shaved Parmesan, fresh basil and oregano).  She then brought me my choice from the draft samples (an IPA) and I sipped it while reading about the antics of those big, playful boys in Washington via my New York Times app.  How on Earth do those henchmen of He Who Must Not be Named sleep at night, let alone look at themselves in the mirror?  Oh, I forgot - like their Master, they're all Undead, so have no reflections... Just as I was contemplating relocating to Canada, my pizza arrived and I immediately cheered up.  I cut myself a slice and dug in - I was pleasantly surprised!  While there's no doubt that CPK is chain pizza, it's unquestionably high-end for a chain restaurant.  The sauce has a nice kick, while the toppings are both decent quality and plentiful.  The weak point of this particular pie was the crust.  It sounded good (both on paper and when Justine gave it her recommendation) but I found it soggy; which highlighted the fact that it didn't have the proper ""independent suspension"" to stand up under the load of toppings on the Sicilian.   To sum things up, I found the bread surprisingly tasty and I very much liked the oil.  The overall pizza quality was a shade better than AOK; we'll call it 3  1/2 stars.  I'll round my overall rating for this visit up to four stars for Justine's cheerful, friendly, and attentive service. While I still overwhelmingly prefer the pizza quality at Mom and Pop and micro-chain pizza restaurants, CPK will certainly do in a pinch; when I come back, I'll try a different crust style.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-tustin,3.2,3.49,3.49,3.216,3.374

Today we had the Spicy Buffalo Cauliflower (I'd skip this), Spinach Artichoke Dip (gooey cheesy, its what you expect), Tortilla Spring Rolls (Thai Chicken and Baja Chicken, interesting take on a spring roll using tortillas and then rolling them up then grilled, my son loves these), Jamaican Jerk Chicken thin crust pizza (great flavor, a little heat, I'd get this again and again), and the chicken meatball thingy (meatballs inside a flatbread thingy, didn't get great reviews).

We were en route and about 5 min away from the restaurant. She said there was no wait at the time for a party of 4. Once we got there we waited nearly 20 min for a table and then we waited an additional 10 min to be greeted once we sat down. With that said, beware of this establishment. They may have great food but certainly lack customer service skills and the ability to estimate wait times. To management, I suggest you train you staff better on customer service and the ability to open their eyes and count the number of tables and the number of guests waiting. If there are guests standing in front if you they're hoping to be seated. Therefore, there is a wait time.

231,Richard S.,"Tustin, CA",1,112,,2.0,2017-10-27,"Take out review, pretty disapointing. Went in and have a couple of women at the takeout counter trying to decide. Person at the registrar is going on and on about the different items, and after several minutes I cross my arms and consign myself to waiting. Then the big reveal, he picks up pizza box that is sitting there, opens it and shows the women to explain ""this is the Hand tossed"". Picks up the other pizza ""this is the thin crust"". So finally after all this they take a menu to decide what to order. I step up give my name and (you guessed it) he pulls out the pizzas that were display items for me. Do I get shown my pizzas. Nope, stuffed in a bag and charged $31 for my 2 pizzas, 6 pieces of hard bread and some plastic ware.  When I did get to my wife's office 10 minutes later, the pizzas almost warm, but no plates and not enough plastic for the 5 of to use. I think I need to find someplace I can get hot pizza that aren't on display in the future. To add insult to injury I call the manager about what happened and I get some cock and bull story - Mgr ""I was out for several days"", 'this just happened 2 hours ago' Mgr ""Oh ahhh I just walked in, ah I'm doing closing."" I told the hostess to tell the Manager about this, so either Sgt.

The pastas were both mild and forgettable, but the greatest issue was that the food was pretty cooled down. Personally, I believe serving the food warm would have made my experience exponentially better. As explained, the food wasn't anything special (you could find or cook half the things on the menu for a cheaper price). The only other reason you would go here instead of a cheaper place would be if you have absolutely no idea what you want to eat. There is a large enough variety of food on the menu for everyone to eat something that suits their taste.  Other review keep saying the service was horrible, but I found it pretty tolerable (and even great at times).
