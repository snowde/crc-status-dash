The Spicy Chipotle Chicken was by far the table favorite, it came with an amazing roasted corn salsa on top & the lime crema was fantastic.  The Works pizza was what I imagine a Meat-atarian would order, just covered in animals & smelled of heart burn, but I'm sure it was delicious.  The Jamaican Jerk Chicken was interesting, but I still preferred the Spicy Chipotle.

Well, first off, usually, I'm not a chain restaurant fan, but since moving out here, it seems that is the choice. Anyways, there has been a CPK in every city we have lived in, but never tried one and after being quoted an hour and twenty minutes for the two of us at the Chinese place around the corner, we popped in here and got seats at  the bar right away. Renee looked after us and the service was stellar. Actually, all the staff were super friendly...no obviously disgruntled employees, and in an open kitchen, you usually spot at least one ;) Anyways, we were both impressed with the menu selection. There were enough light, fresh selections for me, and hearty, cheesy, meaty selections for the man. The arugula and asparagus salad I had as a starter was perfect, and he polished off his jerk chicken pizza...no box needed there. I saw a few of the ""non-pizza"" dishes go out, and the chile relleno looked amazing, plus they got us to sign up for some loyalty club so we get a couple of $5 off coupons for next time. Anyways, for a chain, a damn good one. Seriously quality ingredients seemed to be used...goat cheese, shaved parmasean...which on a mass scale is usually rare...think about Chili's...ick. I suppose the chain does help the prices on the product though, since it was very reasonable. My salad was around $5, and the pizzas were around $12, which you could probably share if you weren't married to a Marine (meaning we got two). AND, genuinely nice people at the bar too.

It's just pissing me off. Please just give me what I ask for! The food was good - Sicilian pizza, Pepperoni pizza, Thai crunch and Chinese chicken salads were enjoyable.

I find that to be unsanitary personally. I overheard the bartender telling her regulars that she was quitting in a few days so I think she just didn't have her heart in the service anymore. She was nice but was not detail oriented. I ordered a salad with no tomatoes and it came with tomatoes and it had to be remade which caused it to come out right before I got my entree. Also when I got the salad she did not give me any silverware and also did not offer me any bread.

The server placed our drink orders  and everyone placed their food orders also.  The personal size pizza pies everyone ordered looked and smelled delicious.  I watched as the cooks were making them and put the pizza in the old school oven where I can actually look inside.  I thought that was pretty neat. All I had to drink was a vodka and cranberry.  I will come back another time to try some of that smell good pizza.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-virginia-beach?start=20,3.52,3.37,3.37,3.088,3.43

I hadn't eaten at CPK in about 4 or 5 years, so I was glad to see my favorite dish was still on the menu- the chicken tequila fettuccine. I stopped in around 6:15 pm on a Tuesday evening and sat at the bar- the first thing I noticed was that quite a few servers were flitting about the kitchen area and did not have their hair up and had long swinging ponytails. I find that to be unsanitary personally. I overheard the bartender telling her regulars that she was quitting in a few days so I think she just didn't have her heart in the service anymore. She was nice but was not detail oriented. I ordered a salad with no tomatoes and it came with tomatoes and it had to be remade which caused it to come out right before I got my entree. Also when I got the salad she did not give me any silverware and also did not offer me any bread. I had a Moscow mule and it was made with Agave sour mix instead of lime Juice which made it sweeter then I cared for. The fettuccine was still good.

It's a tradition for my high school friends and I to get dinner here when we're all in town. So we all ordered drinks which were brought out promptly. I ordered their orchard sangria which was large and very sweet.  For pizza, I ordered their caramelized onion and chicken pizza which was pretty good. I'm not a crust person, but I did eat all the crust this time. Our service was decent until our waitress brought us our checks without prompting. She didn't even ask if we wanted dessert - which I did.  But i'll be back for tradition sake and good pizza.",https://nz.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-virginia-beach,3.2,3.23,3.23,,3.218
