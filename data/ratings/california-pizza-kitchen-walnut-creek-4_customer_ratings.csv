44,Jen Z.,"Flushing, NY",0,46,81.0,3.0,2016-07-17,"First time coming here with another person because she wanted me to try out the pizza here. Me being a native New Yorker why not, I love pizza. The interior is very nice and the food is pretty good for the price too. I only ordered a Hawaiian pizza along with my regular ice tea. The reason I only gave them 3 stars was because the wait for my food was about 30min and the new waiter we got just didn't seem like he cared.. We weren't going crazy on complaining, we just wanted to know why did it take so long because the other customers that came a while after us already got their food but his reply was 'It's not my fault.' and then he asked us if we wanted to talk to the manager. The manager was super nice and apologized. After our meal and when we got our receipt we noticed that the manager deducted the total of our meals, she gave it to us for free and was only asked to pay for tip. Very unexpected. We didn't complain because we wanted a free meal..the total of our food wasn't even expensive. Only $33. We both decided to drop $5 inside the receipt book before we left just cause we felt it wasn't right to not pay for the meal. We tried talking to the manager again that we will stay pay but she refused and told us to just pay the tip and explained that they shouldn't be keeping customers waiting for over 15min just for pizza.  Overall, the food and price was good but the wait and how the waiter approached us was kinda rude in some way. I rather pay the meal than pay the tip..  I remember Leo (not sure if he's one of the manager but he seemed like one) and I forgot the closing manager's name (I'm sorry!!) who helped us with the food. Both were super nice! I'll def come back just not with the same waiter again lol sucks how the previous waiter had to take a break and replaced it with someone else who gave no enthusiasm. In case if the waiter was having a terrible day, then I apologize but hey, you always gotta keep smiling when it comes to work. I've been there before many times. Random personal comment/opinion: I still think NYC's pizza is much better though haha xD",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-walnut-creek-4?start=60,2.732,2.732,2.732,2.732,2.7320000000000007
53,Sara P.,"Livermore, CA",0,7,,5.0,2016-07-22,"Amazing service from our server ""G"" or ""Garrett"" according to the receipt ;). WARNING: dry sense of humor! I asked for no ice in my water, when he came to refill it with a pitcher, one ice cube had made it's way into my cup. He apologized and brought me a new glass of non-iced water. LOL. He recommended the avocado egg rolls and they were super delish! I would recommend these to anyone + the Garlic Cream Fettucine with Chicken! Also, the restaurant looks absolutely gorgeous :D, I wasn't expecting this from a CPK. They have a lot of outdoor seating which is great for the summer. They also have a full bar so maybe I'll stop by there next time!

Tried the garlic chicken which tasted good but vegetables cold and chicken dry.  My wife had Kung po  pasta with chicken but brought out shrimp.  They rushed a new dish which was overly salted and dry.

I asked for soy sauce, Marcelo never brought it. I asked for no green onions and it had green onions. When it finally came, it was dry and overly salty.  Our waiter delivered my soda half full in a cracked glass.  When Marcelo gave us the check, we expected we would not be charged for my dish as it was wrong and finally came 10 minutes after my husband's.

Haven't been to the new location, but the old location was great.  The service is always quick and their servers and hosts are personable and polite. The pizzas are great, but I especially love the Moroccan Chicken Salad - my favorite! The half size is very filling. They also always give complimentary bread and olive oil.

The service takes along time getting drinks out, when ordering they forget add ons on your meal, don't come by to see if you need anything. When there a couple by us got their food and when the girl asked for silverware the waitress walked away and actually rolled her eyes and let out a deep breath. The worst part she never came back and we had to flag someone for them. The food, once you get it and if you have something to eat it with is good.

Super comfortable, high class, and modern interior, with open spaced outdoor patio and spacious indoor seatings. Our server was very nice and attentive. The complementary sourdough bread with herb olive oil was as delicious as usual.  Today we decided to go with all pastas. Great flavors and good portions, I would just like my fettuccine to be cooked harder. SHRIMP SCAMPI ZUCCHINI is a light option that has an amazing great flavor. CHICKEN TEQUILA FETTUCCINE is just slightly creamy and perfectly delicious. GARLIC CREAM FETTUCCINE was a bit to heavy.  Overall, I love this new location and renovation, I will be back for more! Favorites: * SHRIMP SCAMPI ZUCCHINI ($15.59) - A lighter spin on a traditional recipe. Zucchini ribbons sautéed with lemon, garlic and white wine, tossed with parsley, Parmesan and a touch of fettuccine. * CHICKEN TEQUILA FETTUCCINE ($14.99) - Creamy jalapeño lime sauce with spinach fettuccine, red onions, bell peppers and fresh cilantro.

The Tequila Chicken, w/o chicken. The flavors were ok, nothing spectacular or wanting to repeat. I'll try other items perhaps in the future. Service was on point & available.

I ordered the shrimp scampi zucchini which was so good and honestly just the right portion. I coupled it with a glass of sangria and I must say it was a large glass filled with all kinds of fruit. Definitely one of the best sangria from a restaurant I've had. My friend ordered the California Cobb salad and found it to be fresh and again a good portion for an entree. Lastly, we ordered the butter cake for dessert well because the menu says ""just trust us""...Lol so we did. It was served warm, very moist and with fresh whipped cream. We added the Häagen-Dazs vanilla scoop! Overall no complaints on the food. It was quite delicious and we left saying we couldn't wait to come back and try other things on the menu.

To my surprise I ended up with a smokehouse barbecue sand which. I confronted the server Mari and he insists that this is my ""California Club"" so I didn't even bother talking to him anymore. I asked another server what it was and immediately he answers smokehouse barbecue. I told him the situation and without hesitation he offered to replace it. I didn't catch his name but next time I come in I'll definitely be looking for him to serve my family and I. The manager also made the situation more bearable so props to the other staff.  P.S.

Located on Main Street, towards the end of Broadway Plaza and the soon to be open Agora apartment complex, this CPK has revamped their interior. The new, more open layout is appealing along with the simple yet rustic wooden benches. Although I'm sure the ingredients are the same, they are really playing up the farmers/growers aspect of their menu with decorative herbs and pictures featuring California specific agricultural themes.  Food is pleasantly reliable as always. Service needs a bit more attention-the pacing of the delivery and check out was a bit off. I didn't recognize staff from the prior location so maybe everyone in training? Anyway, I am forever a CPK fan and it's still a weekend, go-to spot after shopping or movies in Downtown Walnut Creek.

This one was swimming in oil so was oily and bland. Yuck. We would have ordered coffee and dessert and expected our server to come by since our plates were cleared. After 10 minutes she hadn't shown so we paid and left. The final coup de grace was something contained xanthan gum in enough quantity to create a laxative effect on one of us within 20 minutes. Terrible. New location but very disappointing food and service. Pizza Kitchen used to be wonderful because it was predictable and reliable.

It was not busy, there were plenty of staff milling around, but our wait person was more interested in chatting with coworkers than taking care of us.

Once she finally got to us we where able to order out food; margarita pizza and a small salad with drinks. A couple sat next to us who were greeted right away, as it should be. It took a while to receive my drink, the couple next to us received complementary bread and butter while no one else at the bar did.

We excused the ill person and attended him outside but none of the staff even bothered to help with the mess at the table or in the Isle. We tried to clean up the mess the best we could but soon we were out of napkins. I went to the bar as no servers bothered to help and got more napkins but they were only so effective. After three CPK staff walked by and one actually stepped in the mess as I cleaned on my hands and knees I decides to see if I could find some rags. The hostess station had some rags and cleaner but no hostess but due to the smell I decided it was best for all patrons to liberate the cleaner and the rags.

29,Tori Lynn L.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",157,95,345.0,4.0,2017-02-14,"I wasn't expecting to celebrate valentine's day last weekend, but I was at California Pizza Kitchen with some friends and they were offering a special Valentine's day Special ($35) that began 2/10- and ends today 2/14.  The special was a smaller menu and gave a few options to choose one appetizer, two entrees and one desert.  So, with 5 adults (two of which were a couple with 3 kids), we all decided to share two Valentine's Day specials.    I haven't been to CPK, in a long time, so it was good to try a variety of their dishes.  For the appetizer we ordered: lettuce wrap with chicken, spinach artichoke dip.  For the two entrees (four for us) we ordered: BBQ chicken pizza, Hawaiian Pizza, BBQ chicken salad, and Thai Crunch Salad.  For the desert we ordered the key lime pie and the butter cake because they ran out of the red velvet cake.  However, the buttter cake was surprisingly really good.   So, how did the food fare?   Given this isn't a fancy, upscale, date type restaurant; I would say overall, the food averaged 3.5.  The bread and olive oil (4).  I love their bread but I didn't eat much of it because of all the food we had coming.  Appetizer- lettuce wrap with chicken (3.5).  The lettuce was on a separate plate so you can put as much chicken and sauce as you like in your lettuce wrap.  Lettuce was fresh, chicken was chopped up into tiny morsels and was already sautéed in some sauce, and there was additional sauce to add that made it more flavorful/tasty.  It was pretty good but nothing really spectacular.  Appetizer- spinach artichoke dip (2.5 stars).  Though, the artichoke dip was incredibly tasty and delicious, the chips which were a combination of blue tortilla and white tortilla were stale.  Actually, some were stale.  I found out this out later from my friends.  I just ate one blue chip and one white chip and said YUCK, that's enough for me!  Apparently, they mixed stale chips with fresh chips here at CPK.  I am glad one of my friends actually told the waitress about this.   BBQ chicken pizza- this is one of my favorite pizzas at CPK (4).  I enjoyed it.  Plenty of BBQ sauce but not so much to overwhelm the chicken, gouda cheese, red onions and cilantro on top.  The thin crust was really good.  It wasn't as thin as some places, which I actually prefer.  Hawaiian Pizza (4.5) - this is also a favorite of mine at CPK.  The waitress was kind enough to see if we could substitute the tomato sauce for a white sauce due to my inability to eat anything with tomato in it because of the acidity.  Unfortunately, there was no other sauce but she asked us if we just wanted it on olive oil, and surprisingly this actually tasted very good.  With fresh ham and pineapple, I wish I had gotten 2 slices!  But we were all sharing.  BBQ chicken salad (3).  Nothing special here.   All the vegetables with the chicken, tortilla strips, and bbq sauce tasted alright.   Thai Crunch salad (3).  Again, nothing special here.  The vegetables, chicken, wonton strips and peanut sauce all tasted ok together.  Key lime pie (4).  Pretty darn good, except we had to split it into several tiny wedges!  Butter cake (4.5).  I did not know what to expect with this one, but it was really delicious cake topped with vanilla ice cream.  It was sweet but not too sweet which was great because it was already topped with vanilla ice cream.  I believe with the Valentine Special there was an option to order a bottle of wine but we did not. I don't remember if that was included in the $35 or you had to pay extra.    The customer service here was excellent (4.5).  The waitress attended to our needs, frequent check-ins, gave us more plates, offered more water, and easy check out.  She was also friendly and conversational.  Atmosphere/environment (3.5), only because it is so loud in here!  Other than that, very spacious, lot's of seating, nice lighting, comfy and casual, modern interior with nice paintings, and clean bathrooms.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-walnut-creek-4?start=20,3.12,3.12,3.12,2.9280000000000004,3.1200000000000006

It's poorly lit area and frankly, it's hard to find because it doesn't look like a traditional CPK. Secondly, I don't understand why we got sat all the way in the back and passed many empty tables that were more appealing.  The food as expected was just ok, we got the deep fried mac and cheese appetizer, it was dry and had no flavor. My issue here is the pizza and paying extra for every little thing. You have to pay extra for thin crust. Really? Are the pizzas pre-made and you're that inconvenienced to switch the dough? You have to pay extra for half and half, come on even Pizza Hut doesn't do that. You have to pay extra for pineapple, ok, this I kinda understand, but $1.50 for a few slices? Not ok.

For an app we got the chicken lettuce wraps.  Perfectly round, fresh and crispy pieces of lettuce, great chicken to veggies ratio, interesting sauce with a slight kick.  Wonderful dish. Also got the Banh Mi Bowl (Quinoa, baby kale, fresh cilantro & mint topped with grilled chicken, watermelon radishes, fresh avocado, cucumbers, carrots, bean sprouts, scallions and sesame seeds.
