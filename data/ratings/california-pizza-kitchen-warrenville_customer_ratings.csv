22,Cristina F.,"Chicago, IL",83,62,401.0,2.0,2012-01-29,"I went to CPK for the first time a few weeks ago. It was a slow Monday night and we were celebrating a friend's birthday. The pizza was delicious--- ingredients tasted fresh, cheese was amazing. I would give it  3.5 stars. However, the service was horrible. I'm giving this restaurant 2 stars because the server never bothered to refill our waters and he was basically MIA after giving us our food. I have worked as a server so I would say I have pretty fair expectations. When the restaurant is empty, there is NO EXCUSE for bad service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-warrenville?start=60,3.48,3.48,3.48,2.8880000000000003,3.4800000000000004
26,Max C.,"Naperville, IL",4,94,6.0,3.0,2012-04-07,"I really only come here because it's tough to find a pizza place that serves pizza individually.  The pizza is OK, it's almost unremarkable to forgettable.  But if i'm craving pizza for lunch, I have to get my fix.  The service is always good, and the managers have no problem refilling drinks themselves in case the staff is busy at the time.  The service pushes this from a 2 star to a 3 star review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-warrenville?start=60,3.44,3.44,3.44,3.0520000000000005,3.4400000000000004
40,Ellie M.,"Chicago, IL",13,21,18.0,3.0,2012-04-14,"I love their salads, which is funny because I'm a total carb-a-holic and it's crazy that I don't order pizza here. It's just that so rarely I find a good salad, made with fresh greens, veggies & cheeses, chopped and tossed the right way. CPK does this right, and for that, I am willing to pay $10-13 for a good salad. They have so many varieties. I love their Waldorf, Thai crunch, BBQ chopped & regular chopped salads. They offer them in 1/2 or full portions, and the 1/2 is perfect as a regular meal or to split with a couple friends before your meal.  Their pizza is also good, but I'm a Chicago deep-dish or authentic Italian pizza fan, so I rarely get pizza here. Some of my friends and I have been coming here since high school, and they always get the same pizzas. There is a BLT pizza!  One thing I must say, though, is that sometimes the service is a little cray cray. This one time, my girlfriend and I had this obnoxious waiter that made us very uncomfortable. He stayed too long, awkwardly chatting it up, rarely leaving us time to chat with one another. Then when we needed to pay our bill and get our food wrapped, he was nowhere to be found. The next time I visited CPK, I had a darling waitress who was delightful and very professional. I think it's just hit or miss!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-warrenville?start=40,3.44,3.44,3.44,2.9880000000000004,3.4400000000000004
50,C L.,"Naperville, IL",38,82,5.0,4.0,2012-05-26,"Whether it's margharita pizzas or chicken limone, CPK offers variety. The waldorf salad is my favorite. The service is always quick and attentive, and the food usually doesn't disappoint. I would stay away from the BLT pizza... basically a crust with some bacon strips and shredded lettuce thrown on top. When you see it, it's not too appetizing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-warrenville?start=40,3.56,3.56,3.56,3.056,3.5600000000000005
51,Jennifer C.,"Naperville, IL",0,26,,2.0,2012-10-14,"great service... food is just OK... portions are good , but you definitely pay for it!!  The value is very poor... my son ordered the pepperoni pizza... this pizza was no different than Little Caesars for over DOUBLE the price.  My  husband had the Sicilian Lovers, and both of these had hardly any cheese at all!!  Yet, both were priced between $13-$16!! We enjoyed the fresh avocado, corn and bean salsa appetizer... yet when we asked for a few more tortilla chips to finish up the dip, they charged us more. It would have been nice to have more description on the menu for the salad I ordered (BBQ chicken)... the menu just stated BBQ sauce, ranch and cilantro... there were several other things on the actual salad, including cheese, and tortilla strips, both of which I would have eliminated when ordering, to keep it healthier.

80,Alison V.,"Minooka, IL",763,579,549.0,5.0,2012-12-01,"I had a wonderful lunch here today. The food: We had a white pizza and a California veggie on honey wheat crust. They were both scrumptious but I enjoyed the veggie a bit more since it had more ingredients (like mushrooms, roasted eggplant, baby asparagus, and red onions) and packed more flavor into each bite than the white. The beverage: I tried something new to drink: mango iced tea. They take normal ice tea and add in sweetened flavored syrups.  They had several varieties (peach, raspberry, and another one too), but I am so happy I tried the mango.   ** Sidenote: It tastes a lot like CBTL's Mucho Mango (my favorite beverage on the planet), so you can imagine how happy I was since I normally have to travel 2,000 miles to get one of those. ** The service: Bonnie was wonderful - very helpful in making our pizza selection and attentive throughout the entire meal.  Perfect in every way!

20,Matt B.,"Lisle, IL",0,36,3.0,2.0,2013-07-21,I had the salmon and it ranged from the consistency of dry chicken to salmon jerky.  The person I went with had pasta and it was under-cooked.

76,Amanda S.,"Chicago, IL",234,281,83.0,3.0,2013-10-13,"I came here with my kids. I'm not sure if it's a super family friendly place, but we didn't feel out of place by any measure. I ordered the four cheese ravioli. My eldest daughter ordered Macaroni and Cheese from the child's menu. My other daughter decided she wasn't very hungry so we would share my adult portion of raviolis. My husband ordered the Jambalaya pasta.  The server was very friendly, however he wasn't very comfortable with the kids. He asked them very awkward questions. No points taken off though because some people just don't have a way with kids. I get that. The food came fast. My husband and eldest daughter both enjoyed their meals. They said the taste and portion sizes were perfect! Mine however, was a tiny portion. There were maybe 8 raviolis total. More sauce than anything else. My daughter had a bigger portion of macaroni and cheese from the children's menu. I had her split it my younger daughter because there was no way I was going to be able to fill hers and my belly on my dish. It wasn't very tasty either. Overall. it was an ""just okay"" kind of experience. I probably won't be back. Rock Bottom is next door and they are comparable in price, but hugher in quality.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-warrenville?start=20,3.48,3.48,3.48,2.732,3.4800000000000004
67,Heidi K.,"Naperville, IL",44,290,677.0,3.0,2013-11-23,"I like the location of this CPK. I've had two online order pickups and each time, the cashier was extremely friendly and helpful when I came to pick up my order. I've also dined in twice; the first time was fine but the second was rather disappointing. I think I'll stick to online ordering. I'm addicted to their Quinoa and Arugula salad. I don't know what it is; but I crave it constantly. I've tried recreating it with little success, so I don't mine forking over the $10 or so on occasion as a treat to myself. I've also had their Margherita pizza, which was fabulous (first time trying CPK). I was alone, and was seated at a high-top table near the bar, which was fine. Server was great and I got set up with their Pizza Dough rewards card.  One my second dine in experience, the bf and I were seated in a booth. I had their Chicken Tequila Fettuccine. It was delicious, except my experience was ruined by our inattentive waitress. She was more concerned with socializing with her regulars seated about 3 tables away. It took me three tries and waiting 20 minutes for a water refill. It was a Sunday afternoon and hardly anyone was in the restaurant. Yet we were also seated by a group of three men who were talking loudly and generally being disruptive. There's no reason to talk that loud when there's 5 other parties dining in.  Overall I don't care to dine in there, but as I said, I've had no issues with my online ordering. So, I'll stick to that and keep away from the terrible waitstaff and ignorant patrons.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-warrenville?start=20,3.4,3.4,3.4,2.7,3.4000000000000004

I have dined at the Oak Brook location and enjoyed it, but this location was remarkable!  I have a background in restaurant marketing and general advertising--but not with this chain.  I was blown-away at how perfectly they handled everything.  This was a particularly noteworthy experience.  The staff is highly trained.  I was extremely impressed--it was better than a textbook example of how a server and manager should connect with their customers.

We were greeted with a smile and had a table ready and waiting! And we're talking 7:30pm on a Saturday! - Server was charismatic, knew his stuff, and had a great attitude. So mad I didn't take down his name -- he was a tall gentleman with blonde hair put in a ponytail. You, sir, are amazing. - Service was attentive, food was super fast, and restaurant was clean with a great atmosphere/ambiance. - The food was holy crap delicious. I had the peach salad with salmon, and a white wine margarita. Probably the best margarita of my life.

21,Jason V.,"Chicago, IL",0,3,,5.0,2014-08-05,"CPK has been the go to for fresh, great food. I do a ton of pick up ordering. Staff is always friendly and helpful. The other night they were late in getting my food ready (15 minutes past the expected ready time). The staff was very apologetic as they were clearly slammed and had mistakenly given an aggressive ready time. I was only 5 minutes into driving home after getting the food when I received a call from the staff informing me they had comped my meal because we waited so long. I've NEVER had a restaurant do that. Ever. Despite being late in getting me my food, that classy move just got them a loyal customer.

There were 5 of us, and we were splitting a whole slew of things. The dumpling appetizers were good, as were the egg rolls with lots of avocado and bacon, which were even better. The harvest salad was surprisingly ultra fresh and delish, with lots of candied pecans, fruit, field greens, cranberries gorgonzola cheese. The best pizza and the one I would order again is the extra thin artichoke, spinach and chicken pizza. With a generous helping of these 3 ingredients and both mozzarella cheese and parmesan cheese, that was an awesome pizza. While a pasta dish was good and the meat-lovers pizza was hearty and tasty, this was the best entrée/pizza. Service was fantastic, our waiter kept up with all the drink and water refills as much as the alcoholic drinks.

The bread slices have shrunk, they don't bring out any Parmesan cheese or butter to go with anymore (just a dish of olive oil), and the BBQ chicken salad appeared to be completely lacking any jicama. We tried the lettuce wraps but they weren't nearly as good as the ones at Pei Wei. Oh, and when two people are dining would it have killed them to provide four pieces of lettuce instead of only three? Overpriced and underwhelming is my new view of this restaurant. I do rather like the atmosphere of this location but that's not enough to make me want to come back. I will say the hostess was absolutely wonderful and friendly.

My girlfriend and I came here one Saturday night which was our first mistake, the place was packed with long wait times. Once we were seated our waiter arrived, and he reminded me of Pauly D from the jersey shore, very fake and and annoying. The prices here are outrageous, especially for mediocre pizza. I got the gluten free pizza and it tasted like cardboard, avid what it worse was the price 16 bucks for a small personal pizza!! The girlfriend got Martini and it was almost the price of her pizza, now I'm not a cheapskate by any means, but if your going to charge an arm and a leg for your service I better leave happy and satisfied which i did not.

The waiter creeped me out and wasn't very friendly. Their appetizer menu is very small and they hardly have anything that's Italian, seriously it's a pizza place have something that's italian. I had the white pizza which was good but my boyfriend got the gluten free pizza which he thought tasted terrible.

My husband I were starving and he felt like CPK, a place I would frequent in junior high when cruising Oakbrook mall with my besties. The one out here on Diehl is well positioned across the street from the world's BEST Target, and in front of an enormous movie theater. The interior is bright and nice and the service is fine, but last night, we wanted takeout. CPK has online ordering (YES!) and curbside pickup (HELL YES!) and we scanned the menu with glee to pick out our choices. I noticed that a LOT of the menu items had truffle oil on them(I'm severely allergic to truffles), but the pizza we chose did not, so I didn't think twice about it and moved on.  We picked up our food and a delightful young lady brought it out to us promptly. Upon arriving home, we saw we were missing our appetizer. Annoying, but they credited our bill and still let my husband go pick it up, so forgivable. I had a slice of pizza and it was delicious. Then I went for a second slice and smelled... Truffle oil. Oh god, I thought. Is it on every slice? It's not supposed to be on this pizza at all! I put the slice back down and waited. Terrified. An hour later, fears confirmed: I was sicker than sick. I'm fine now, but yikes. Don't sneak weird ingredients that can make people barf on to pizza, please. In conclusion, I won't be going back to CPK, but you probably should.

78,Mike Z.,"Chicago, IL",0,26,,1.0,2016-06-14,"I eat at CPKs all over and they are usually so consistent I don't even review them. This one was pretty bad. I walked in at about 7:45 and the bar was empty but totally trashed. Literally no place for one person to sit that was clean. The bartender was nice enough but took forever to come back after he dropped the menus. I think the guy was the only bartender on and was doing his best. I ordered the bbq chicken pizza (which I always get) and the crust was so soggy I couldn't pick it up. Aren't they known for their pizza? I had waited long enough so I just dealt with it. I got the impression that the manager would not have helped anyway. 3 tables had issues while I sat at the bar. At one point he told a table that had a complaint ""whatever"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-warrenville?start=20,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006

9,Beth R.,"Naperville, IL",0,11,3.0,1.0,2016-11-08,"I placed an order online for two pizzas and chose to pick them up with the ""curbside"" option. The order went through and I got an email a few seconds later confirming my order and saying the pizzas would be ready in 20 minutes. I live about 15-20 minutes away from this location, so I got in the car and drove over to make sure I showed up in time. Upon arrival, I called into the restaurant as I was instructed to do from my confirmation email. I told the employee who answered the phone that I was waiting in one of the Curbside Pick-Up parking spots outside. She said someone would be out promptly. Twenty minutes later, no food, so I call back in and the same employee answered the phone and said someone ""would be out promptly."" Another employee came out a few seconds later and confirmed my order. I asked her what took so long and she said the employee who answered the phone ""got busy and forgot."" Nice excuse. Pretty sure I can't use that at my job. She went to get the pizzas, came back out to my car and her exact words were,""Well......that doesn't look like how they USUALLY make it!"" and this was in reference to the spicy chipotle chicken pizza I had ordered. At this point, I'm annoyed that I've waited 20 minutes, and one of my pizzas isn't ""how they usually make it."" So, I asked the employee if I can just have my money back. She avoided the question and said she was going to run inside and get the sauce for my pizza. Umm..excuse me? The pizza doesn't even have the right SAUCE on it? Okay...  She comes back out with the sauce and I go home. With the chicken pizza, I specifically ordered it to come without poblano peppers. With the first bite, I noticed they were on there.... For $30+ for two pizzas, I could have definitely had a better meal somewhere else with far better service and less hassle.

However, we were seated next to a pile of dirty dishes which sat until the food came.  All the staff was busy cleaning up elsewhere so we waited almost 10min for someone to take our order.  We ordered as soon as she came - two pizzas and 2 waters. After another 10 minutes I went to the bar to get the water since they were all busy cleaning.  One of the kitchen staff had to get the bartender's attention since he was busy cleaning the bar (it's about 9:35 at this point, 25 min before closing) The pizzas come about 5 min later.  The wife's looks good, nicely browned, bubbled crust.  Mine was shoved in the oven and not touched: one side brown with a burn bubble and the other flat and raw looking: think ""freezer pizza"" Of course she goes back to cleaning because, why waste time with customers, especially since they aren't paying?  I took a couple of bites of one piece and left the rest.  When she came back she offered to make another one - I had been there over half an hour at that point and it was within 15 minutes of closing so I declined. I go to the one at Oakbrook Mall and it's usually good.  I would never set foot in this CPK again.  If they are going to offer Veterans Day specials they should at least treat the customers with the minimum respect they would give anyone else, otherwise don't offer them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-warrenville,2.2,2.2,2.2,,2.2
