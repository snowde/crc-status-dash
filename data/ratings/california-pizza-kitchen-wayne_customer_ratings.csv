60,Lor A.,"Voorhees Township, NJ",308,323,724.0,4.0,2012-03-18,"I don't typically love chain restaurants, but my friend and I had a good experience at CPK this weekend.  The wait was about 25 minutes at 8:00 PM, which is NOTHING compared to the wait at the Cheesecake Factory (as if I even need to say that).  The host at CPK is a trip...he is silly as hell and he looks like Sammy Hagar.   Apparently their soda machines were not working, therefore we had to choose non-carbonated beverages.  No problem.  Water for me, iced tea for her. We split the sesame ginger dumplings for our appetizer.  They were a little under-seasoned, but the plum sauce that accompanied them more than made up for it.  I couldn't decided between a pizza and a salad, so being the clever broad I am, I opted for the tricolor salad pizza.  It's essentially the tricolor salad (mixed greens, tomato, and shaved Parmesan cheese) on top of a thin, Parmesan seasoned crust.  Sounds like it would be Parmesan overload, but it was excellent. My friend ordered some huge-ass salad that had everything you can imagine, right down to pears and walnuts (which she sheepishly said that there weren't enough of).  It seemed like the tables around us were waiting an awfully long time for their apps and entrees, however, all of our food came out very timely.  I kind of felt guilty biting into everything while our fellow diners looked on with envy. All apologies! Tatiana was our server and she was very sweet and attentive.  She didn't rush us and she kept telling us to please take our time upon receiving the bill.  CPK offers a full bar menu, and if I read said menu correctly, it looks like you can order a half-glass of wine (should you choose to partially imbibe).  A half-glass of wine is an appetizer for me, however, this might suit you lightweights out there quite well.   Not a bad choice if you're looking to grab a relatively inexpensive sit-down dinner at the mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wayne?start=60,3.056,3.056,3.056,3.056,3.0560000000000005
75,Edwin M.,"Verona, NJ",11,73,,4.0,2012-05-19,I've been here a million times and the service is consistently really good. On occasion I have had a waiter who seems as if he/she rather be sleeping but they don't seem to last in this cpk. As for the pizza itself it is very good as well. I usually don't really care for franchise food however they do a good job here. The stuff always tastes fresh as well.  My personal fave is the BLT pizza.  For some reason I LOVE their brownie sundaes. Actually am having one right now as I write this review...

And here ... the service is just not that good. In fact, it was downright annoying. I met my cousin for dinner; she beat me & already got a table by the time I arrived. I walked up to the host & explained I was meeting a woman who was just seated a few mins ago. ""Oh, are you the party of two? She's over there,"" and he gestured vaguely to the right side of the dining room. You can't bring me to her table? Fine. I awkwardly scanned the dining room, staring at strangers eating, until I found her. So much for hosting, amirite? Our waiter was a combination of lazy & rude. He never asked if I wanted a drink; he just brought me water & asked what I was ordering as soon as I sat down. Each time he brought us more water, he left the empty glasses on the table. By the end of the night, we had 5 empty glasses cluttered around us. My cousin asked for cheese on her salad & he forgot it twice.  Halfway through our meal, and interrupting our conversation without an apology, he asked if we wanted dessert. When we said no (mostly because we were still eating dinner), he brought over our check!! We weren't close to finishing our meal, but we can take the hint: it's Friday night & since we're not drinking or getting dessert (yet), you want to turn our table. He looked confused when I asked for a box for the remaining half of my pizza -- did you think I was going to keep eating when you asked me to pay after eating 2 (of six) slices? We were asked to pay 35 mins in, & we stayed only an hour. My food was great -- and there's your second star -- but does that really matter? Between the hosts & the wait staff, it's really not the hassle. So the next time you're craving those delicious pizzas? Just drive the extra 15-20 mins & visit the Short Hills Mall or Garden State Plaza CPKs instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wayne?start=40,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.9200000000000004,3.2800000000000002

The host knows our family and they're very friendly. The food is as usual delicious however my last visit to CPK with my family wasn't as pleasant.  We get our table immediately (kudos) but our waitress did not come until 5-10 minutes into our sitting. When she came, she brought our drinks relatively quickly and we went right into ordering our food. The food took a bit longer than usual to come out, I'd say 15-20 minutes? [I don't want to peg an exact time, but it was in these ranges]. I ordered a Kung-Pow Chicken Spaghetti less on the spicy side. It wasn't as spicy as it usually was which is good. My father ordered a half sized roasted veggie salad however the asparagus wasn't cooked well. We told the waitress about it and she sincerely apologized about it. Here comes the good part. FLIES. Tons of them! So yes, the food smelled very appetizing but it should be the restaurant's job to do something about this! Sanitation? I don't know. But it sure bothered my family and two other tables that were around us. (They had it harder). I cannot stress this enough but please be aware of flies.

57,Bill M.,"Glastonbury, CT",9,53,1.0,2.0,2014-09-19,"Meh. Well put Yelp, Meh.  Ambiance - 3 Stars: It's CPK... what do you expect.  Service - 1 Star: They're just not good. The guy who seats you is a bit scary, intense, and a bit intrusive. Some of the wait staff is okay, but generally they're rude.  The worst experience was when the chef left the kitchen after complaining about one of the dishes. One of the specials was a chicken stuffed pepper with cilantro and other fresh vegetables, sounds delicious right? Well it wasn't. When it came out we immediately noticed a strange smell. Oh well, give it a try anyway. It was gross. There was a noticeable taste of just bad. My initial reaction was that the chicken was either uncooked, or had gone sour. I singled out a piece of chicken, and it smelled awful - and tasted the same way it smelled. When we informed the waiter that we did not want to continue eating it, nor did we want a replacement - the CHEF came out. Why they didn't send the manager out is beyond me, and why the manager didn't prevent the chef from approaching us is also beyond me. He began arguing with me that I had poor taste, and that the ""bad"" taste we were experiencing was Cilantro. Cilantro does not taste like rotten meat, it tastes like soap. He continued to argue that the meat wasn't bad, which makes me assume even more that he KNEW the meat was bad, and served it anyway! After I couldn't take any more of his crap, I interrupted him - explained to him that it was extremely poor customer service to argue with a customer - and told him to leave my presence. A manager never came out to apologize for his rudeness.  Food - 3 Stars: Despite a few of the dishes we had there being on the rather - awful - side, I still had plenty of tasty pizzas. The Habanero Carnitas is one of my favorites.  Price - 3 Stars: I think the pizza is a bit expensive for what it is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wayne?start=40,3.36,3.36,3.36,2.7600000000000007,3.3600000000000003

Both had nice fresh ingredients, especially compared to other chains, but being next to NYC definitely isn't going to compare to pizza there.

I ordered the Hawaiin, I had to spit twice, once from a rubbery piece of chicken, and again from some kind of grit I still haven't identified but actually hurt my tooth. And that could be explained away by bad luck, but the final nail in the coffin was that it was just an under-cooked pie. The dough was floppy and there was no crisp to the crust at all. I'm usually not picky about these things, but this is the first time I've ever really regretted something as simple as pizza.

I rather not even leave a review but I must say this night my family and I experienced the worst service. Fast forward, our food comes and before I realized we had no utensils our waitress disappears into the abyss.  After staring at my food for a minute or two and feeling Hangry my little one quickly walked over to the other table and got us 2 of 4 utensils sets. OK deeeep breeeath, WoooooSaaaaaa..... I looked over to my wife and daughters dish and realize there was no fettuccine Alfredo sauce in the dish. Ummm is this CPKs version of fettuccine Alfredo??  Anyway, moving on to what was just the beginning. Our waitress comes back and I tell her we had to take utensils from the other table but needed more. In the same breath I asked for more fettuccine sauce for two of the 4 dishes and more butter for another. Yeap, that requires her to make multiple trips back to the kitchen. Although she was polite and complied I could sense she would rather disappear back into the abyss.  Ok..ok...Let me concentrate and talk about the only good part of my night. It was my dish, Chicken Piccata, pasta with capers was actually delish!!! It allowed me to gather my thoughts enough to relax long enough to enjoy a few bites.  Now back to the madness, I got no refills of my glass of water nor was I asked. Never received the additional silverware we needed, classic waitressing 101.. What some details can change your entire dining experiencing. Not to mention we went here because my daughter chose it for her birthday dinner. So my wife towards the end asks me if were gonna get a dessert for my daughter and mention its her birthday in hopes they would come out with a candle and a quick Happy Birthday song BUT I quickly looked at my wife and said that I refused to ask because I was just so disturbed by the waitress and lack of service and good food.

2,Vince M.,"Pequannock, NJ",11,125,281.0,3.0,2017-10-08,"We were very favorably impressed, with CPK. So I'll break down our review, and you'll understand why only three stars. Service. The service was excellent! From the time we walked in the door, to the time we left, service was pleasant, attentive, and prompt, but never intrusive. It's the kind of service that makes you want to come back. Ambiance. CPK is a very pleasant place to dine. It's roomy, very clean, well-kept, light and airy. The food. This is where CPK fell, from five stars to three. I ordered the pizza Margherita, and I was surprised at the excessive amount of pizza cheese. Normally, excessive cheese would be a good thing for most. But on a pizza Margherita, the cheese should be sparse, and the mozzarella should be fresh, rather than sliced pizza cheese. I found the pizza Margherita to be overly oily and heavy. I also ordered the buffalo cauliflower. I have had this dish both at home and in other restaurants, but at CPK the cauliflower appears to have been batter coated and fried, and then dressed with buffalo sauce. Again, I found it to be overly oily and heavy. The one bright spot, was the ultimate Bloody Marys. It was very well-crafted, with just the right amount of spice, but not too hot. The garnishes were interesting;  however, the mozzarella in the garnish should have been fresh, not sliced pizza cheese. We do intend to return however, and next time I will probably choose a much lighter version of the fare that I enjoyed this time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wayne,3.32,3.32,3.32,,3.3200000000000003

1,Ashleigh C.,"Honolulu, HI",50,16,7.0,1.0,2017-12-12,"This was the worst CPK I've ever been to. Let's start off with the fact that after I finished eating, there was a roach I had to kill; it was crawling on my bag sitting on top of the bar counter.  Note* This incident took place on a Monday afternoon.  Before that disastrous ordeal, I started off with a lunch combo of a chicken meatball piadina with a mediterranean salad. This was the meal I settled for after being informed that they were out of stock of the seasonal short ribs & mac meal (which I had my heart set on). The piadina and salad were okay except for the fact that the dressing that came with my salad was weird and orange, I'm pretty sure that wasn't the dressing it was suppose to come with. I was too hungry to notice sooner. Then before I left, I ordered a bahn mi bowl to go. Now home, I've noticed that I got the same weird orange dressing for the bowl when it was supposed to come with a chilli-lime vinaigrette! What a huge, disappointing difference this dressing would make, if I decide to even eat the bowl after seeing that roach on the bar counter! What a waste of $30 dollars.  The only positive thing I have to say is that the staff seemed friendly and my beehive sangria was delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wayne,3.24,3.24,3.24,,3.2400000000000007
