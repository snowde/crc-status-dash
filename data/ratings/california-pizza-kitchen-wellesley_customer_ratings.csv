46,Ronald L.,"Wellesley, MA",11,51,7.0,4.0,2012-01-11,"Ate here last night with the kids.  They do a great job catering to the kids and food is consistently good and prompt in our case.  Our server Courtney was great, kids liked her and she was very sweet to them. My daughter who is 5 gets the adult portion of the Chicken Piccata and my son gets a small pizza and a side of broccoli.  I had the caramelized  peach salad (Yum)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wellesley,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.48
14,Alicia D.,"Salem, MA",149,192,65.0,1.0,2012-05-04,"""No Soup for You"" was the motto on my first and only foray to this place.  I participated in a fundraiser at work, there was a large order from my group, and my soup was missing.  In addition to the non existent soup, I ordered the Mediterranean Hummus ""plate"", which was more like a Mediterranean Hummus ""saucer"" or ""cat dish"" for its size. This made the loss of the soup all that more tragic, as I was hungry and looking forward to my lunch.  (stomach rumbling in remembrance) So....naturally I called to ask what could be done, and I was told by the manager who came to the phone after a long wait, ""I packed the order myself and did not leave anything out.""  Well.  OK.  But.  I still don't have any soup.  The person coordinating on my end told me it was one short.  So, what's a girl to do?  The manager reluctantly agreed to process a refund, but gosh I would have LOVED if someone had brought over my soup.  I was stuck with the very tiny cat sized ""plate"" of (I admit) rather delicious hummus, a chopped mix of cucumber, onions and olives, a tablespoon of dressing, and a ""shot glass"" of feta cheese.  So, the one star is for good hummus.  But there was a crazy small amount of it.  One does not want a refund at lunchtime when they're hungry--please bring over the soup that was ordered, and DON'T try to blame it on me.  Ugh, never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wellesley?start=20,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116

44,Ian Y.,"Hartford, CT",183,363,156.0,4.0,2013-05-29,"I'm begrudgingly giving this place 4 stars because my first experience at a CPK (albeit a different one that ended up closing) was so bad that I swore I would never eat at a CPK again.  But alas, when meeting up with some relatives, it was decided that we would dine at a CPK, and I didn't want to argue. I had the Spicy Korean BBQ Pork Pizza, which was delicious, and priced only at $12, it was a pretty good deal.  The Sobe-fruit juice drink was also good, though priced at $3, it's on the high side (even with free refills). The staff was very friendly and prompt with getting our orders in and our check to us when we had to leave in a rush.  The atmosphere was also nice, even though the restaurant was quite crowded. So, fine.  I'll give in and reward CPK with 4 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wellesley,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76

I called to ask if I could order food and either pick it up or if they could run it over to me (since it is literally a few yards away) and they said its $100 minimum, and they were very rude. There aren't a lot of food choices in the area, especially since I can't leave my job.

4,Andrew J.,"Manhattan, NY",202,142,401.0,2.0,2013-11-14,The food wasn't very well prepared.  Staff was slow and relatively inattentive considering this was lunch and there weren't very many people.

2,Sanjay P.,"Wellesley Hills, MA",0,6,,5.0,2013-11-17,"Really tasty, fresh food with fresh ingredients. Great service and professional staff. I had been here a year back  and I can certainly say that this place has changed for the better.  The asparagus and arugula salad was impressive and the deserts were to die for.. Good job with the improvements made over the last few months! Keep it up! We are watching, CPK.

I've been here three times and every time, the food has been served reasonably fast and just as ordered, and the service has been attentive and polite. It's never super crowded.

0,Joe S.,"Wellesley, MA",0,60,2.0,1.0,2015-01-05,I am constantly unimpressed with CpK. I have been here multiple times and it always disappoints. $13 for a cheese pizza that is so small. Not a good value. Spaghetti Bolognese was rated a B-/C+ from someone at our table. The service was fine but I've been here when the service is terrible.

Service is slow, and the food actually doesn't taste the same as other CPK's. My BBQ chicken pizza was wayyy too saucy and the chicken was very chewy. It took forever to get our check and my water was never refilled. Not a great experience overall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wellesley,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52

35,Brandon K.,"Westwood, MA",161,1505,24565.0,5.0,2015-10-10,"This place is cool!  I thought these were only in malls, but found this, here on Yelp, and decided to check it out. I ordered multiple pizzas over the phone, on the  way to Wellesley to an event as well as some errands.  First impression of this place: the woman on the phone... she was so professional, it sounded like I was going to The Capital Grille. The ""Did you want Curbside?"" part, at the end was stunning... They have that? Wow.  Anyway, I didn't get curbside, because I wanted to see what the restaurant looked like, so I know what I'll be looking to come back to. The atmosphere is amazing. Lots of booths, tables, and everyone inside (employees and customers) seemed to all be having a great time. The take out counter is very small and compact, yet the guy who was there was very friendly, happy, and informative about a great rewards program they have.  Once home, the pizza was still hot (and I went somewhere after and then home another 20 minutes away in Westwood!), and was delicious. I think I like thicker pizza better, but this thin crust pizza was super delicious and tasteful. The bread was also good, yet tiny.  Overall, I would definitely return here, and will dine-in soon, as it looked like a great place to go for dinner or lunch. I wonder how the mall locations (like Natick) compare.....  Located in Linden Square in Wellesley, on Linden Street, easily accessible via Route 135 or Route 9.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wellesley,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68

40,R B.,"Brookline, MA",0,55,1.0,1.0,2016-08-10,"Pretty awful!  This chain needs a complete supply chain and operational overhaul.  From the frozen or dated  tasting salmon to the poor quality control and training,  there are bigger problems than with just this one location obviously.    We ordered a half Caesar for 7.75 with added salmon for 4.75. Granted for that price I would not expect the best however, the Caesar was made with  veryso so bottled dressing,  shaved cheese and many mediocre croutons it had about one ounce or less of cut up salmon dispersed throughout the salad. Strange presentation. Could not easily tell what was a crouton and what was salmon.  The cubes of salmon were of approximately the same size as the plain croutons.  Ate the salad, told them to forget bringing me more salmon as I realized it was not as fresh as it should be.  The  manager comped the dinner but really-- who needs this hassle.  I cannot remember having such a poor meal. No wonder cheesecake factory next door had a twenty minute wait and this restaurant had many empty tables.  The floor was also dirty, s part of bench upholstery ripped.

At other locations I have DEVOURED the pear & gorgonzolla pizza. This time? Pizza was overcooked and pretty tasteless...I could hardly get through 2 slices. The before-meal bread was good I guess...

Always a crap-shoot. My only consistently negative comment would be for the ""mixed drinks"".  Bottom line: Don't bother ordering one.  Drinks at this location are incredibly weak, at best, or contain no actual alcohol, at worst.

Yes it can get hectic there because everyone seems to come in early with hungry kids in tow ( as we are as well). Even when busy, attentive servers and managers on the ball are there to rectify those issues that inevitably come up. Best example was tonight's experience with late food that the manager and server quickly explained what went wrong and rushed the order to catch up. I've read the other less than favorable reviews and disagree with the overall tone. We have eaten here once a month for the last five years on average and come back again and again because it's reliable and easy to enjoy a night out here with our family",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wellesley,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68
32,colleen c.,"Brighton, MA",69,2,,2.0,2017-12-03,"I've been into CPK many times with my daughter after one of her classes or if my husband is working late. From the perimeter, it seems like a good place- kid friendly, good food selection, & even decent wine for adults. The thing is the servers seem very mad every time I go there. Like they really don't want to serve you, your bothering them, and sometimes even rude. I get that Wellesley is a Well to do town and it may feel a little like that to the service people. But here's the deal- I personally do not come from that background growing up, and I was a waitress through college. I was good to my customers - I served well. I do not feel the need to tip 20% to a waitress who seems bothered by me or who rudely drops my bill at the table without saying thank you. The food and beverage bill add up. And the quality and s just average if that. Unfortunately, we won't be returning to CPK. I'd rather spend 10-15.00 more at Alta Strada or the cottage and get better service & higher quality food. My advice to the servers? If you don't like the job, get out. We all have to work and this is your job so do it well or move on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wellesley,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
