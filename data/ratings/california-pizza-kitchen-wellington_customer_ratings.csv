53,Michelle M.,"Wellington, FL",48,235,332.0,2.0,2012-07-18,"I love pizza, so I really looked forward to eating here, but I was just disappointed. There are good chains, and I think CPK is overpriced and the atmosphere seemed cold and unwelcoming.  The prices were absolutely outrageous to me. $13 for what is about the size of a personal pan pizza? Yes, I get that they put on fancy toppings and it is a bit more substantial than your normal pizza place, but come on! My husband and I shared a meat cravers pizza, and I found it nothing more than average. The spinach dip was merely okay. Their beer prices, also ridiculous.  Selection wise, I give them an A++. They have a million different combinations of pizza, as well as pasta and salads. The prices just took away from any enjoyment I may have had eating.  There are so many good, local, low priced pizza joints out there, try them and not here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wellington?start=20,3.0480000000000005,3.0480000000000005,3.0480000000000005,3.0480000000000005,3.048000000000001

We were seated very quickly but it took a while for our entrees to come out. I ordered the carnitas tacos, they were ok. I really think $10 for two tacos (that only included salsa and chips as a side)were overpriced. The tacos weren't nasty but they didn't blow me away either. My friend ordered the meat cravers pizza.

The best thing about the place was the 1)  the peaceful surroundings - the music is not loud and the people are quiet. 2) they make it a point to pay particular attention to people with food allergies and make sure you don't get sick 3) the employees and waitstaff are very friendly and attentive. -very relaxed and were nice to our little kids who can be bratty very frequently.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wellington?start=20,3.56,3.56,3.56,3.564,3.5600000000000005

They have amazing salads (large, fresh, unique and tasty) and everything has a fresh, light-handed approach. Many people overlook their spicy/Mexican-flare which is often as-good/better than their specialty pizzas.  Their White-Corn Guacamole is excellent.  Their Tortilla Soup is very good (especially combined with the Potato Leak, as ""Two in a Bowl"").  I believe the Chili Relleno's are new, very tasty. They're also extremely good about sending food back that is not to your liking.  It's a policy for the entire chain, it seems.

50,Jamie K.,"Boynton Beach, FL",26,77,,4.0,2015-06-15,"It was a shopping girl's day but before diving in heels first to the good stuff, we had to fill our bellies and regain energy. We figured California Pizza Kitchen had a little bit of everything for everyone. Our server was very sweet when she came to the table for our drink orders, everyone was drinking wine or beer (because what else do you do in the middle of the day on Saturday?) and it was a fresh strawberry mango cooler for me (preggo here.) Our server brought over bread and was very patient as we chatted away without looking at the menu for a good 20 minutes. What I really appreciated though, was she happened to notice that I wasn't quite downing my drink; while refreshing and very delicious it was a little too sweet for even my liking. Shocking I know. After finally stopping to look at the menu, we all ordered, my girlfriend's had the Tuscan hummus and the chicken flatbread and I was still undecided by the time she got to me. I asked for recommendations and settled on the vegetable salad which came highly recommended.  Because we went back to talking without missing a breath, I didn't notice whether the food wait was long or short, but alas it was time to eat. I know for sure one of my girlfriend's loved her flatbread because it was almost gone before we left, my other friend enjoyed her hummus and commented on how much she liked the pita that it came with and she appreciated the freshness of the vegetables. My salad, wowzers; I was talking about that thing even the next day it was that good. It had every fresh vegetable you can imagine: roasted eggplant, avocado, tomatoes, red and yellow peppers, roasted corn and sun dried tomatoes all over romaine lettuce and tossed with a light, and very mildly sweet Dijon balsamic vinaigrette. I also threw some grilled chicken in for a little protein. Honestly, my husband and I had stopped going to CPK because they took our favorite pizza off the menu - this salad would make me go back. It was really delicious and loaded with vegetables that were all very fresh, I just enjoyed that every bite I took had a different flavor. If you are a salad lover, go for this one for sure.  We didn't save any room for dessert this day because we had a shopping mission to accomplish, but it was definitely a good choice for everyone and I will now be back to CPK in the near future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wellington?start=20,3.56,3.56,3.56,3.472,3.5600000000000005

46,Jay Infamous L.,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",150,493,35.0,3.0,2015-07-12,"One of the few spots I went to this recent trip in West Palm Beach.  My love for pizza is probably as much as my love for burgers so when trying out California Pizza Kitchen for the first time was somewhat anticipated. Firstly, had the strawberry Mango Cooler which sounded good at first till it arrives. It looked like flavored water...which is what most of it taste like. It is suggested that you stir this drink a little to get some kind of flavor out of it but that helps very little. It tasted like 40% water at the begin, 20% fruit juice in the middle and another 40% water when it gets towards the end of the drink. I should of went with the margarita instead. Now for the pizza: I had the mushroom pepperoni sausage pizza, which I wouldn't of minded if I could of gotten it without mushrooms in the first place. The pizza however was good and so was the Ceasar salad that came with it as well but it could of been more filling and as mentioned would of preferred to have the choice of having it just pepperoni and sausage or to at least choose an alternative to the mushrooms.

Pair it with mushrooms and shrimp and it's a hit!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wellington,4.12,4.12,4.12,,4.12
4,Pamela F.,"Los Angeles, CA",61,441,624.0,2.0,2016-12-28,"We love CPK so this was a big disappointment after an hour drive from our Lake Worth Airbnb. Service started out great (and why not? we sat at the counter) chatted up the sangria choices until we ordered the sampler and our thai chicken pizza and then, evaporated. It took 30 minutes to get the drink -- and another 45 minutes to get the pizza. We finally broke down and asked if our order had been lost after we burned through the entire sangria sampler and it was nearing 3 p.m. (we arrived at 1:40). Probably the worst service experience at any CPK ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wellington,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0
2,Mark M.,"West Palm Beach, FL",72,45,186.0,5.0,2017-03-18,"California Pizza Kitchen, Wellington: This restaurant went FAR above my expectations that I had for it, going in. I ate by myself at the bar and chatted with a couple individuals I had just met. Ambiance: Dimly lit, except for in certain areas of seating. At the bar, you get dinner and a show! You can see the two ""pizza chefs"" making the pizzas and putting them into the oven. Food: Being my first time here in awhile, I tried two ""spicy"" menu items. Both of which were amazing. 1st, I ordered the Spicy Cauliflower dish, & 2nd, I ordered the Chipotle Spicy Chicken pizza. The bartender/my server was amazing and her name was Carly. She was attentive and courteous to all her guests(including me). She was on top of whenever I needed a refill on my sweet tea and even gave me one to-go. As an ex-Chick-fil-A employee and hospitality manager after working there for 5 years, I can recognize a reputable and great operation when I see one. California Pizza Kitchen is running on all ""cylinders,"" and looks like they have many pleased guests like myself, as well. I will definitely be returning in the near future to sample some of the other menu items and update this review. I would place this establishment in my top-10 of favorite places to eat, in West Palm Beach/Wellington. Keep up the great work, CPK!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wellington,4.04,4.04,4.04,,4.04

6,Natalie C.,"Lake Worth, FL",68,94,292.0,5.0,2017-04-28,"I'm embarrassed to say it but this was a first for me. I had heard of California Pizza for years but had never given them a try. I was at the mall doing some retail therapy when I decided to try it for lunch. It was a weekday and the place was packed like Friday night happy hour. While I contemplated why so many people were not at work, I decided to sit at the bar and browse the menu. To start I had a glass of their delicious orchid sangria. I don't remember what was in it but it sure tasted good. I went with the margherita pizza and was glad I did. The margherita is my test. If you mess up this pizza you shouldn't be in the business. A nice crispy crust, a robust red sauce and real good cheese and fresh basil. California hit the nail on the head. It was really good. Good pizza from a chain restaurant not a mom and pop kinda surprised me... pleasantly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wellington,4.08,4.08,4.08,,4.08
11,Jennifer K.,"Lake Worth, FL",72,156,44.0,4.0,2017-05-20,We recently started going back here! We were on hiatus for a little while but they've updated and change the menu and all their new selections have been good so far. The staff is always attentive. They redesigned the Decour is well. The bathrooms are always clean and it's great for a quick meal while you're shopping and you don't want to go to the food court. The avocado corn salsa with blue chips is my favorite thing.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wellington,4.08,4.08,4.08,,4.08
15,T W.,"Boynton Beach, FL",0,18,,3.0,2017-05-28,"My wife likes this place for some reason... but after joining her here for a half dozen times... I still don't see the attraction. To me, the food is VERY average, typical chain restaurant fare. The pricing seems to be way high compared to the quality of the meals. I do not mind paying a premium price for genuinely good food... but I hate it when I get a mediocre meal... and then have the bill to be twice what you would expect for that meal. My wife says she likes the place because she can get salad.. or sometimes a decent pasta. Well, maybe there is a small bit of truth to that.... but $40 for a lunch, when the food is average, is way out of bounds for me.

5,Susan B.,"Wellington, FL",19,113,,3.0,2017-06-23,The food and service continue to be excellent but the restaurants is way too loud for any kind of conversation. All fabric has been removed and chairs and booths are mostly hard surfaces with nothing to muffle the noise. The decor is current but not comfortable or suitable for this sized restaurant but the food and service still attract a steady stream of guests.  We will go at 11:00am in the future to avoid the amazingly high noise decibels...noon on Friday was almost unbearable between screaming babies (understandable) and the acoustics or lack thereof.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wellington,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0

0,Chad H.,"Arlington, VA",139,304,601.0,4.0,2017-11-26,"I usually enjoy my meal at California Pizza Kitchen, and this time was no different. This particular location is inside Wellington Mall. To start out, we shared the Bianco Flatbread which was very good. The combination of gorgonzola and mozzarella cheese went very well together. We first ordered the smashed pea barley soup, but it was a little watery, so we returned it for the sedona tortilla soup. The tortilla soup was thick and delicious, and not too spicy which I appreciate. I ordered the Bahn Mi Bowl for my main dish. Very flavorful with quinoa, chicken, avocado, cucumbers, and more. I liked that they put the chili-lime vinaigrette dressing on the side. The bowl could have has a bit more chicken in it, but nevertheless, I still enjoyed it. If you are super hungry, I recommend something else, but it was good for a lighter dinner.  Service was good for the most part. Took sometime for one of the beverages to come out, but otherwise was fine. When we needed to exchange the barley soup for the sedona tortilla, that was no issue. Waiter was friendly. Overall, I enjoy California Pizza Kitchen and will certainly return to the one by where I live. Nice atmosphere, good food, and positive vibes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-wellington,3.92,3.92,3.92,,3.92
