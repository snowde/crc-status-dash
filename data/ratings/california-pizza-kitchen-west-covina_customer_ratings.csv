42,Ivan L.,"Walnut, CA",564,28,4.0,4.0,2012-01-04,"3 stars, +1 more for the excellent customer service from Manuel. You already know what you're going to get from CPK when you come here. My gf and I decided to try something different, she went with the Chile blah blah I don't even remember what it's called but I went with the sun dried pasta penne cream thing. The Chile thing was different, but it was good! Something I've never had before. My penne pasta was ok at BEST. Ordered chicken with it ($3 more ok no big deal right? Except, I counted like 7 TINY pieces of chicken. That coupled with a mediocre sized plate of pasta = I'm still hungry). My GF loves the mango/strawberry-iced-teas but our server mixed and matched them to perfection. He frequented our table and was always making sure we were satisfied with everything (I wasn't with the food but his exceptional service was a difference maker). Honestly, I can cook the pastas and the pizzas at home for far less than what CPK charges. However, the service here is fantastic, thanks to Manuel. Real cool, down to earth dude. Hopefully all the other wait staff is just as attentive and caring as he is.  It's been a while since I tipped +30%.

68,Angel L.,"Baldwin Park, CA",536,140,349.0,3.0,2012-02-04,"mmm.. 3.3 stars?? Came here a couple nights ago with a friend to catch up over some dinner. We got there at about 830 pm ish. (I ended up eating a little before getting there so I didn't order anything.) It was my friend's first time so I was really excited to have her try some of my favorite dishes... so much for that!! Looks like CPK is undergoing some changes with their menu.. my beloved cranberry walnut chicken salad sandwich is no longer available along with a couple other dishes! ): DEEEVVASSSTATTTIONNNN! boo. Our server, Eric, was very informative, funny, and patient with us. I guess he's been with the company for about five years now? he gave us the whole run down of the menu as to what was more popular and which ones he preferred. I would totalllly hire him I had a restaurant. just saying! Anyways, it took them a while to take our order this time around too ): My friend was STARVING! and it was funny cause we were joking that Eric could've put my friend's baby in danger! (she's prego :D ) but Eric was a really good sport about it. He kept us laughing and smiling the whole time. We ended up ordering the spinach artichoke dip and the california club pizza. Their dip just doesn't seem to come out as hot as I'd like it... everrr. But it was creamy and not too heavy. My friend liked it, lots. The california club pizza looked amazinggggg! I've had it before but I didn't have any this time around since I ate already. It comes topped with avocado, and shredded lettuce. Let's just say I got a thumbs up from m'friend (: yay! The score remains at 3 stars and the only reason why I even bothered mentioning the 0.3 is because of Eric's capability to dissect each and every dish we talked about as well as making us laugh.  It seems that service is one of this location's weak points..

Both presentation and flavors are always spot on. The pizzas are very good too for a chain place. The wild mushroom one is on the top of my list (make sure to add truffle oil).

69,Melissa G.,"Monterey Park, CA",139,268,209.0,2.0,2014-01-17,"If you look at all the recent reviews, you'll see that CPK is going down hill. I used to LOVE coming here a few years ago, but this past week's lackluster experience ruined years of being a happy patron for me. First off, the food. The food is what makes up 75% of a rating, and I must say I was sorely disappointed. We tried the spaghetti bolognese (pretty basic, so should be easy right?) and overall the dish was pretty plain. To begin with, there wasn't enough sauce for all of the noodles, but then again the sauce itself didn't have a very strong flavor to it, so I'm not it would have made a huge difference anyway. We also had the wild mushroom pizza. Taste-wise this dish was okay. The most disappointing thing is that the dish was cold. Finally, the nail in the coffin was the service, or lack thereof. Our server was inattentive and though we asked for a refill of lemonade twice, the refill wasn't given to us until after she gave us the check. 2 stars for CPK. If it weren't for the giftcard we used I'd probably be even more irked. We will most likely not be back.

104,Savanah D.,"Solana Beach, CA",1,56,6.0,1.0,2014-01-23,"I went here for dinner with my boyfriend. The host didn't seem like he wanted to be there. He was going to seat us near a huge, loud birthday party (maybe 14 people), when there were tons of other empty tables everywhere else. We requested a different, quieter spot, and then sat at the table we picked. We had two different waiters. Our second waiter took his time getting our order in. We ordered something to go, and he placed the order. About fifteen minutes later, I see him folding pizza boxes on the other side of the restaurant. He did this for about 9 minutes. He brought our to-go pizza and it was the wrong pizza we ordered. So we sent it back, and got our correct pizza. If the people who work here were more people-oriented and seemed like they like working there, I think it would be a better place. I think the waiters and hosts don't really care that much about what the customers want! Not going back there. Also, everything is over-priced. $12 for a salad? We got one salad, two pizzas, and one beer. The total was about 60 dollars. You would think that when the food is that expensive, the service would be over the top, really nice. Not here. I'd rather go to Pizza Port in San Diego: 2 beers, 2 pizzas for about 40 bucks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-west-covina?start=80,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96

61,Jowel G.,"Covina, CA",152,377,987.0,4.0,2014-02-16,"The night of Valentines which is just another Friday night dinner night for us was I guess a better night than usual. The service and additional selections were a plus. Why can't this be every night?! Early dinner advantage-parking up front, no wait, prime seating. It's still considered Winter but the 89 degree temps made for a comfortable night to dine out in the patio.  We were given the special pre fixe menu and the regular menu. The pre fix was such a deal with an appetizer 2 entrees and a dessert for only $30. Unfortunately, we came in with predetermined options in our head and that was it. Starter was the steamed dumplings that stands great on its own. Can be filling if you eat all of it yourself. I haven't had the tequila lime chicken fettuccine in years. One of my favorite dishes that reminds me of the old and now defunct Crocodile Cafe in Pasadena. I asked to go light on the cream, so my chicken and pasta are not drowning in sauce.  I guess tequila is just part of the name now because I don't taste the tequila just the lime. It's all good though-yummy nonetheless. The chimichurri chicken and vegetables were a welcomed change for the palette. I had to reach with my fork for a taste. Perfectly cooked chicken and grilled veggies were fresh.  The chimichurri sauce was as green as pesto with a slight punch of heat.
