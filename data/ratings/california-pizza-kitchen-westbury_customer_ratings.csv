When we arrived we noticed there was a long wait, but we didnt expect it to be that long. We waited 45 minutes before we were seated. By the time we were seated, we were starving! We ordered a Tuscan Hummus as a appetizer. It was pretty good. After that we decided to share a Hawaiian BBQ Chicken. It was also really yummy. The worst part of our meal was the drinks. I currently cant remember what we ordered. It was some kind of fruit non virgin pina colada. It was so sweet! It was such a waste, both of us only drink a little of it and decided to order water instead.

122,Alli P.,"New York, NY",24,72,29.0,4.0,2012-04-16,Im a big fan of Hawaiian Pizza and the one at CPK is done pretty well. However what I want ALL of you to know is that if you like macaroni and cheese you NEED to get the crispy mac and cheese appetizer. Dont go by the pictures on their website because it does not do those magic bites any justice. The plate really is appetizer portion and probably is good enough for just one person- my boyfriend and I were so impressed with them that we would have been happy with our own plates and possible a few more to make it a dinner! The breading is very tasty and not so oily that you regret eating it later on. The cheese filling is just gooey enough where you wont complain about it needing more cheese or having too much. Weve tried to recreate them at home but nothing really compares.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-westbury?start=120,3.36,3.36,3.36,2.9280000000000004,3.3600000000000003

I have never ordered a drink at CPK, other than a coke before today. Based on the mojito , I will continue in that manner in the future.  The newer Carnitas pizza is yummy and the salsa seems like its made in-house, although tasted fresher on my previous visit.  Here at the Garden City location, there is a really nice waitress who smiles so much.  I don't recall here name but her name tag says she's from Merrick. I checked later and see that's a nearby town, I'm not from around the Islip area. (I think that's what they call it here.) The only reason I held back a star is the mojito ...

7,Alyssa P.,"Brooklyn, NY",613,1079,2515.0,4.0,2013-07-09,"After months of listening to a colleague tell me that i had to try you out, i visited with the hubs.  Bored with some of the other establishments in the area we decided to try something new.  So glad we did.  I had a great meal. After calling ahead (saturday night around 9 there was a 15 minute wait) we arrived and were immediately seated at a table in the middle of the room.  The arrangement and décor is on the simple side.  Large picture windows take up most of the wall space on 3 sides of the restaurant and a large curved bar with an exposed kitchen swings you around to the dining room.  The space was open and bright yet still maintained an intimate feel. After several minutes our waiter arrived to take our drink orders.  He was a true delight.  Very friendly and totally accommodating*.   We started with a couple tortilla spring rolls ($8.50 for 2).  #1: Baja chicken (jack, cheddar, corn, black beans, onions, cilantro and  guac.)  Yum.  #2: Thai chicken (sprouts, onions, carrots, cilantro, mozz cheese and peanut sauce.)  Yum yum yum.  Thai was definitely the winner.  Loved the flavors and the peanut sauce was soooo good. Order size is really good, because they're made in, like, 9"" tortillas each roll is cut into 3 pieces and ended up being a larger appetizer than we originally thought.  Next up were the pizzas.  Having never been before we weren't sure of the pizza size and ended up ordering two*.  First up was the Jamaican Jerk Chicken (jerk seasoning, bacon, onions and bell peppers on a thin crust).  Really good flavor.  Had great spice that you could actually see and the crust had that perfect crunch to it.  And they did not skimp on the bacon.  Yay bacon! Second pizza on the table was the Original BBQ Chicken (bbq sauce, smoked gouda, red onions and cilantro on a regular hand tossed crust).  MMmmm I love BBQ chicken pizza.  And this one was top notch.  Sauce was smoky and sweet and there was plenty of chicken.  Both pizzas were good, but I think we both liked the crust of the original better.   After spending the day outside in 97* temperatures it was nice to sit in an air-conditioned establishment and enjoy a quiet meal, and the free refills on sodas AND flavored iced teas/lemonades didn't hurt.  Between the two of us there must have been 10 refills.  And our waiter even poured me an extra one for the road.  So nice of him and really was the icing on the cake.  I'm reserving that 5th star for the next time but our first trip offered up great pizza, good atmosphere, refreshing mango iced tea and I'm absolutely looking forward to my next visit.  *Depending on the level of your hunger one pizza can easily feed 2 people.  Of the 2 pizzas we ordered we took home just a little less than a whole pizza.  Don't get me wrong- it made for an awesome left-overs-lunch the next day but next time I don't think we'll order so much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-westbury?start=40,3.08,3.08,3.08,2.9280000000000004,3.0800000000000005

At 20 years old, I've come here for over ten years and so shouldn't be so surprised at what a kiddie farm this is. There are families everywhere, many with toddlers and pre-adolescents. The service is nonetheless swift and deals pretty well with the audiences. Parking is rarely a problem, on the outskirts parking lot of a Costco and Sports Authority. It's just the restaurant that's crowded all the time and groups of people always sitting and standing around the entrance waiting for a table. It can feel chaotic with all the noisy lounging, running and dining. Still, the staff manages to deal with this crowd. As for the food and the CPK chain, I mostly have to talk about discussing food quality here. Whatever you're risking for flavor, the average hot dish will give you the heavy chest feeling and icy throat fire of heartburn with its abundance of oil. The mere thought dissolves my appetite. The food tastes great, sure, if you eat it before it hardens after spending 15 minutes in the open air, but the consequences are still the same. Desserts are decent, still just as fattening. I hear drinking hot fluids afterwards helps alleviate this issue, but I mean that's considering you and you friends have room if you haven't cleaned the plates you've been served; then you just get bloated. The bottle of table wine always confuses me.  But still, if you eat little and fast enough, you might get away with something that I never have.

96,Gilbert T.,"Uniondale, NY",1,44,1.0,4.0,2014-01-12,"I came here with my family today for a late lunch. We have been to CPK years ago, but haven't been back recently. Our experience was fairly good. We started with a Half Waldorf Chicken Salad and a Half Caramelized Peach Salad. I have had the Waldorf Chicken Salad previously and I remember enjoying it a lot (this was actually the only reason why I convinced my family to go back to CPK--for their Waldorf Chicken Salad). I was ecstatic to have my salad and devoured it in no time flat. The variety of textures, the crunchy pears, the creamy bleu cheese, the soft red halved grapes, with the leafy greens was just as I remembered it. However, my sister did not like her caramelized peach salad, but put up with it and finished it. She was nauseous afterwards but she sucked it up. For our main entrees, my parents shared a Mushroom Sausage and Pepperoni Hand tossed pizza which was good! I'm a big pepperoni fan and there was a good balance between the three flavors. Highly recommend it. I shared a California Club pizza with my sister and it was okay. There was lots of lettuce and not enough dressing. It was kind of dry and sort of bland. I wanted something sort of citrusy/vinegary to cut through the avocado. If there was a little more dressing and salt and pepper, it would've been excellent.  My other sister had the ""Two In a Bowl"" soup. It was split corn and pea soup. She finished the entire bowl and really enjoyed it. No complaints there. Tip: Be adventurous with the menu. What i LOVE about this place is that they encourage adventurous eaters who are willing to try new things. If you don't like something you decided to try, they'll replace it with something you do love. Such a great policy. Also, if you get the flavored ice tea, make sure to mix it before enjoying.

My son ventured from his normal pepperoni and tried the Hawaiian kids portion. As for me I had the Thai Chicken pizza.  Overall the night didn't disappoint and it certainly would require a return visit.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-westbury?start=60,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.768,3.1600000000000006

It wasn't that crowded when we got there..however by the time we were finished and leaving it was PACKED. Service was BAD. This waitress obviously didn't want to be tipped. She came over to our table to take our drink order about 10 minutes after we were seated. When she finally came around to bring our drinks, she didn't apologize for the long wait, rather put down our drinks and LEFT. Yes, LEFT without taking our FOOD ORDERS. WE WERE RAVENOUS. When she finally took our orders, it took another 30 or more minutes for the food to come because the ""kitchen was backed up"". People who sat down AFTER us were ALREADY eating. Kids were getting cranky and couldn't sit still. Food finally arrived. We ate, and ordered some more food to go for the parents who didn't join us in our meal. We asked for the check as well because we figured it would take a long time for her to bring us that check anyway, we didn't want to stay there any longer. Long after the take out food arrived, we were STILL on the seat, waiting for the check. Unfortunately, I didn't bring cash that day so I paid with card and had to wait for the waitress to bring me my receipt to sign. I nicely informed  her as she waited our neighbors that the heck was ready. She turned to say ""thank you for telling me"" and left.

Not sure if the waitress was on her first day on the job or what the situation was but other staff/ manager walked around and had nothing to say with the obvious discomfort. For starters we ordered wine which was left on the table for us to pour on our own. The waitress did not know the obvious difference between Pinot Grigio and Pinot noir (red/ white). From appetizers to entrees and then to dessert all dishes were left on the table. We were so uncomfortable that we just kept pushing the plates towards the end of the table. Dessert was served without spoons. Once requested we were handed 5 serving spoons that were nearly impossible to fit in our mouths. Not sure if this place is considered fast food or a chain which I'm not familiar with. Considering the prices we expected just the basic service which this place lacked to the max.

Next, we were seated and left wondering who our waiter was for 10 minutes.  Following this, the waiter came out and took our order for a couple of appetizers, a flat bread mushroom/spinach flatbread and tortilla spring rolls.  My wife asked for bread and butter as well.  The waiter said he would be right back.  15-20 minutes later, the waiter came back with the appetizers and bread together.  Why didn't they give is the bread while the appetizers were cooking? The appetizers came out cold, the waiter offered to heat it up, we took him up on the offer.  In the mean time, we started on the bread.  It was stale, definitely not fresh.  The butter was spoiled, it tasted terrible.  Because it was not fresh, the cold bread just tasted terrible. 5 minutes later, the appetizers came back, they were basically around the same temperature as when we got them.  The waiter asked if he could reheat them again, I told him it was fine, we would deal with it.  The actual taste on the spring rolls was weird, it had an odd smell to them.  I'm not sure what it was.  The flatbread was lukewarm and not really crispy, because it was made long ago.  Why must everything be lukewarm, and why can't the food be fresh? We ordered a basil pesto penne for the main entree.  It was also lukewarm, and actually quite dry.  The flavor was just ok, almost decent, not something I would ever seek out.

The Details: Now that most chain restaurants in New York have to put the calorie facts next to the entree options, I feel like there's literally nothing I can eat and not feel guilty about (always trying to lose 5 lbs). That being said the California pizza kitchen is definitely calorific so go into that expecting you'll have to do a few more lunges afterwards.  They recently made their pizza smaller to be less gluttonous, and probably less expensive to make. Either way the food is delicious.

My tried and true favorite is the BBQ chicken pizza with bacon and pineapples! CPK lets you split your pies in half for like a $1.00 charge I believe. So you can try two flavors at once and I do it every time I come here. If you're into salads, the BBQ chicken chopped salad is amaze-balls lol  They have a rewards program and if you come here you can rack up some freebies. I would suggest anyone to sign up.

(Not our order-sorry).  Finally our waiter came over took our drink order while we wait for drinks someone brought out 2 more dinner dishes to our table - again not our order. I did both ice this wasn't happening to just us. There were servers circling the dining room with dishes they didn't know which table to serve. I ordered a salad and a main and my friend ordered a pizza. My main course was served (just mine and before my salad came out) we had no small serving plates. When I ask for some they brought over 3 (table was small and we were only 2).. Anyway midway through my main my friend was serve her pizza -- wrong pizza! Sent back pizza only to come back burnt 15 mins later. I received my salad (who knows how many trips the salad took before it found its way to my table) . We also ordered 1 pizza To go and ask that we get it with check. They brought the to go pizza before we were serve our meal.  Who's running the kitchen and managing the orders and staff? It made for a very unpleasant experience. When I made a comment to our waiter that service was poor tonight his reasons was tonight is better than its been.

My husband and I haven't been to CPK for over 5 years so we decided our Friday night dinner will be spent here since all the other good restaurants around had a long wait while this place had no wait at all. We were seated right away when we arrived and 10 minutes later, the server finally came to our table and asked us what we wanted to drink. He came back with our water but forgot my lemon. I reminded him shortly after but didn't get my lemon until about 15 minutes later. I ordered the spinach artichoke dip for our appetizer, a sausage with pineapple thin crust pizza and my husband got the mahi mahi tacos. The spinach dip came out about 10 minutes later and it looked watery (not creamy).  The dip was not cheesy and lacking all ingredients. I could honestly say the spinach artichoke dip from Trader Joe's was better than this. Our entrees took FOREVER to come out, it wasn't even that busy and it took like 40 minutes before it finally came out. The pizza was the WORST I've ever had in my life (at this CPK location)! It was soft and soggy like undercooked pizza and lacking sausages in some areas. My husband said his mahi mahi tacos was ok, it needed more fish in them and the salsa dip looked rotten. The service here was subpar, server was not friendly nor attentive. My pizza cost the same as all the other specialty pizzas; if I knew that was the case, I would've just ordered a regular supreme.

My BF has his usual chicken piccata.  I come during the slower hours, so that may have helped. The reason for this place getting 4 stars is based on how we were discriminated upon entering. The hostess was in the front with a waitress having a quick convo...whatever...and the waitress gave us one look...and blatantly shook her head and said, ""uh uh, don't put them by me..."" did some scratching off on the section floor plan that the hostess has, and continued, ""i'ma change my section!""   I didn't care...because there was no way I wanted to tip or give my money to THAT miserable, obnoxious, judgemental and possibly racist person! Overall, I get great service from other servers. I've even seen the servers do a great job. Not only do they help the customers, but they help one another without question.  I'm pretty observant of servers because my sister was one at a 4 star restaurant in Manhattan. I've also done my fair share of hospitality work and know it is NOT easy!  Servers start stereotyping the kinds of people who come in, for example: ""asians and tourists don't tip"", or, ""that family always eats everything then complains and wants everything comped."" I know it's done. But seriously, don't freaking say it out loud or in front of people...ESPECIALLY CUSTOMERS!!! I would never mistreat a server.

That should've been my first single to run.

Our food came her pasta was tasteless. when the waiter brought my pizza he spilled the pizza all over me it's it was like discussing. Did I mention that I was wearing a white vest? I could've understand that it was a mistake, but the fact that he laughed and then I saw him laughing every time he looked over the table just pissed me off. Then the head waitress came over and said oh I just put a new piece in as a rush for you he'll be here in a minute and walked away like no one apologized, I shouldn't of had to pay for pizza. Then the pizza came and it was dry, burned, and disgusting.  Did I mention that I had a SWAT away little flies, probably fruit flies, during the entire time we were there?

The pasta tasted fresh and homemade. Not like Olive Garden or Bertucci's which more tastes like of of the box(not that there is anything wrong with Olive Garden's rendition). I was shocked and amazed by the pasta. There really was no garlic flavor, so if you want a dish with heavy garlic flavor, I would not recommend this one. If I didn't know any better, I would have thought that is was just regular Fettuccine in a cream sauce. For dessert, I usually get the Butter Cake, but I can find it to be a little on the dry side. Definitely do not get it without ice cream. This time, I decided to try the Belgian Chocolate Soufflé Cake. It was the best decision ever! It is so good and the vanilla bean sauce makes it even better. It gives it a nice flavor without overpowering the chocolate. The only thing is, there is no chocolate sauce in the middle, so I wouldn't really call it a soufflé.

The service here is where you can really play Russian roulette.  Some servers are good and responsive.  Some are not.  Ours today for example was nice but dude could not count to save his life.  We had 6 people, he brought out 4 pieces of bread and 2 plates.  We told him we clearly needed more plates so he brought out 3 more.  3.  Sigh.  He did at least bring out a few more pieces of bread.  He refilled drinks ASAP and checked in frequently.  Extremely pleasant, but boy numbers were not his friend today.  This is the CPK Westbury eating experience in a nutshell.  2.5 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-westbury,3.0,3.12,3.12,,3.0720000000000005
37,Barry K.,"Merrick, NY",0,15,,1.0,2017-01-15,The service was extremely slow. The restaurant was not busy on a Sunday evening at 8:00 p.m. This was my second visit in less than a month and I experienced the same issue 2 weeks earlier. The management better step up their game or this CPK will be history within a year. The pizza is nothing special that can't be enjoyed and found at a local pizzeria.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-westbury?start=20,2.88,3.1,3.1,,3.0120000000000005

0,Diane S.,"Syosset, NY",158,364,483.0,2.0,2017-01-23,"OK, I am particularly annoyed today with CPK for the following reason: On line, looking at their menu with no prices, I see the down at the bottom - lunch 'duos.' yes, I see the word DUO and know what it means... I'm going to get a nice bargain here ! A coworker was on her way there, and I was to text my order. Looking at the menu it starts highlighted: STEP ONE: choose a personal pizza or half sandwich... easy, I can do that... STEP TWO: choose a cup of soup or salad... fantastic - here we go - no problem... then STEP THREE: add your favorite to complete your meal.. there's a few beverages, a few apps and a few desserts - sweet !  bonus like a happy meal... then Jess comes back with my lunch and my change of a TWENTY is 92 cents. WHAAA?? The online menu fails to inform you that Step three - complete your meal, comes at a premium.  This makes me mad. I figured the lunch ""SPECIAL"" would be $8 - $10 $12 ? tops... nope. Lets review the food. 7"" Pizza - I chose the mushroom pepperoni sausage pizza - it was dry and a bit hard to chew, not chewy - it was hard to chew, like cardboard is hard to chew.  The toppings were tasty however. Salad: I chose Caesar, a dull standard, I know, because after all - I really only wanted pizza, but it was a lunch special for god's sake. The salad was lost in the huge container it came in - the lettuce not chilled, so wilty would have been a kind word.  The parmesan shaving and the big bricks of crouton made it look good but didn't save it. Last and certainly least - the ""Butter Cake"" I guess this was ok if it is supposed to be one of those Italian desserts that are meant to be stale and break the plastic cutlery.  California Pizza Kitchen...

31,Kaitlyn A.,"East Rockaway, NY",0,5,1.0,1.0,2017-02-18,California pizza kitchen? More like McDonald's playpen cafeteria. The atmosphere of this establishment reminded me of babysitting my brothers three kids all under the age of seven. I would comment on the food but it was way too spicy to even eat (that was probably our fault).

We spent over an hour and a half there and most of the time it was waiting for our server. He spent more time chatting with co workers than attending to the customers.

Cleanliness and overall atmosphere and ambiance of this place is virtually nonexistent. Hurried and harried service, by a seemingly uninterested server.

22,Barbara A.,"Westbury, NY",4,35,,1.0,2017-07-27,"My husband said his salmon tasted funny, my salad was less then OK, and my son said his chicken was good, but I never saw such a small portion. We also shared a so so pizza and the price was $90.00 before the tip. Did I mention that the service was also pretty bad. The waiter disappeared until dinner was over, so we never got refills and I never got to tell him he brought the wrong salad dressing, and literally out of nowhere, at the end of the meal he asked if we wanted water. So if you want to go to a fairly dumpy place, have the worst service and less then average food, for a pretty hefty price, go to the California Pizza Kitchen.  There are three chain restaurants right there in a row on Old Country Road, California Pizza Kitchen, Olive Garden, and Ruby Tuesdays, and the California Pizza Kitchen is by far the worst and most expensive!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-westbury?start=20,2.4,3.02,3.02,,2.7720000000000002
64,Cortney W.,"Brooklyn, NY",534,366,1044.0,3.0,2017-08-12,I wasn't impressed with this location. My cousin and I arrived after 9 PM specifically for dessert. For the butter cake which is delicious. We were seated right away by the host and the server came over pretty quickly. He asked what we would like to order and we asked for the dessert menu. We ordered the cake and then we were asked if we wanted anything else so I decided on ordering coffee.  The cake arrived in a good amount of time and he came back to say the coffee was brewing. The cake and coffee were very good. No sooner than we put our forks down he asked if we wanted anything else. The tone was a bit off putting so I assumed it was closing time. It was only 10 PM and the restaurant closed at 11 PM. We continued to sit and chat and then he came back and said do you want the check now?  Again it was rudely stated and like he was rushing us out of the restaurant.  We paid and he had the nerve to ask if we needed change. Ummm taking a $6 tip for yourself for dessert and coffee for one. No. The price didn't warrant it and neither did his attitude.  I noted that he was a lot more friendly with the table beside us. Perhaps people he knew because his attitude was that different. Some retraining maybe necessary for this particular server.

When in doubt, choose a chain restaurant? I had not been here in years so I figured why not? It was surprisingly quiet for a Friday night. We were seated at a table in the far back, right by where the kitchen/bar area is so you can watch them make your pizza (which is kind of cool to watch). We settled on the garlic pizza since it seemed simple enough. The pizza was okay, not great, definitely not bad, just okay. They weren't lying about the amount of garlic, that's for sure.  Our waiter was super friendly and kept checking up on us. The hostess seemed to want to tell us everything and anything about CPK. The bill came out to $36 for 1 pizza and 2 beers.
