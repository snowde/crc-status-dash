7,K D.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,26,,1.0,2012-04-06,"Food is significantly worse then the real cpk. Will never eat here again. Avoid at all costs. The actual place has a better menu option. This is a sad attempt at a resturant. ASAP or not, I'd rather eat better food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-westlake-village,,,,,

I like that, makes me feel like my food is getting prepared to the best of its abilities. Over all decent pizza and good artichoke dip. They could get little more variety with the beverages though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-westlake-village,,,,,
3,Staci F.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",35,141,,3.0,2012-10-25,"This place is always a hit or miss for me. A miss because i am not usually a fan or corporate food chains. But i can't seem to steer away from the cobb salad they have. Its amazing!! I love how they offer a full or half size. The half size is a perfect portions. It comes with Beets too!! my fave!! anyways. I only go here for my salad. Otherwise, there food is your usual food chain food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/california-pizza-kitchen-westlake-village,,,,,
