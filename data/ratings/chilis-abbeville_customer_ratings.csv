4,Brandi K.,"New Orleans, LA",1272,386,361.0,2.0,2014-01-11,"*2.5 stars* Stopped by one afternoon for (what I hoped to be) a quick drink or two at the bar. The lunch rush was slowing down but there were a number of people still lingering, including in the bar area.  It took quite a while to even be acknowledged by a bartender. So much so, I was wondering if I should even stay or not. Eventually he came around and took my order of a Coors and a Grandmarnier. I got a funny look for it... I can only speculate why. Although (I think) it was a pretty simple order, it still took a while to receive.  I could see what the pattern was going to be like during why visit, so as soon as I was done with the first Gma, I ordered another one. When it arrived I immediately asked for my check. It still took forever to receive. My advice: don't be in a rush when dining/drinking here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-abbeville,,,,,
1,Kim B.,"Maurice, LA",85,86,92.0,4.0,2016-04-11,"It's a chain restaurant, So I'll only review my experiences at this location. The food is good, it's gotten A LOT BETTER than what it used to be. I feel like it tastes fresher and the food comes out at a good amount of time. i used to have to wait forever for my appetizers, entree's and desserts. I do like to come here if I'm bringing out my Godchild bc he does love their burgers and chips. This is a good location to come to bc of the friendly staff and the wait for food isn't so long anymore.  my TO GO experience. They were GREAT. I ordered food for my son's birthday party (ribs,salad, appetizer) and my family of somewhat picky eaters were all happy. I'll most def order catering again for last minute parties. I ordered 6 hours ahead of time and had no problems with pick up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-abbeville,,,,,
3,Reynold L.,"Kaplan, LA",0,5,,1.0,2017-05-11,Called ahead after my daughters graduation for 15 people. Got there and it really was not that busy at all. Took an half hour far a waitress to come take our drink orders. Another half hour far our food order then anther hour to get out food. Mine was incorrect with 3 items missing from my order. My 77 year old mother was the last to get her food when we were almost done eating. The manager which was from Houma and just helping out did what he could but it left me a very bad experience. I've been a Chef for 30 years and know those nights when what can go wrong will go wrong but it's hard to ignore when it's happening to you. Manager took some off of the bill but I had the highest check and only took off 10$. Not looking far a free meal but come on. The food took so long that my graduating daughter had to box hers up because she had to go to a senior project lock down for graduating class.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-abbeville,,,,,
2,Ben T.,"San Antonio, TX",0,4,,1.0,2017-06-17,"This is the worst restaurant I have ever been to! Every time I have been there, it has taken over 10 minutes for a waiter to say hello. The food has always come out warm instead of hot. The staff is nice but I don't understand what is wrong in the management. I have eaten at chilis restaurant my entire life and its only been this particular restaurant in abbeville that is poorly managed. Corporate needs to get involved. The entrance stinks... the restaurant stinks. They need to tear it down and start afresh. With new building and new management!!! The managers are NOT doing their job. Do not eat there. You will have an awful time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-abbeville,,,,,

The our 35 margarita dinner included a desert and even though It slipped my mind our server brought us boxes without even bringing it up. I didn't remember until I got home, you guys should also put just a touch more tequila in your margaritas but I like the amount you get. The chilli's in Elk Grove California is still hands down the best!! The best part of this chilli's was hanging with my son and the food. Service needs to step it up I would have never let my guest walk out with out there full dining experience which includes their desert!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-abbeville,,,,,
