16,Lisa E.,"Abilene, TX",36,47,,2.0,2013-08-18,the drinks are awful..the hostess are even worse. the foods okay. Any other chilis I got to I get margaritas..this chilis I don't even bother it taste like I am drinking just the mix.   this chilis is a disgrace. I also went there when they were having kidds kids..where a certain percent of your bill went to kidds kids..and our waiter had no idea what I was talking about and he never said anything about it again. bad staff. worse bartenders..,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-abilene-5?start=20,2.408,2.408,2.408,2.408,2.4080000000000004

20,Jennifer R.,"Copperas Cove, TX",0,6,,1.0,2014-04-25,"Our family has given this place 3 chances and only once have I actually liked my food (a salad). Just tried the fajitas and I am pretty disgusted. I am almost certain the chicken portion was boiled because it had that chunky texture and no cook marks whatsoever. The steak portion came out bleeding. It was rare and mushy. I didn't request it that way but I've never been served bleeding fajitas at any other establishment that served fajitas. Tried to pick a lower cost margarita for a Friday evening, no prices on the drink menu so I go for a little mini margarita sampler which would equal one standard size... Turns out that was $9!!!! My husbands fries where blatantly heat lamped and had no flavor. When the server asked how the food was as she could see we were done, my hubby told her the fajitas weren't great (obvious by how little I ate of them), couldn't care less and brought our check. That's $55 we will never get back again. I am so done with this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-abilene-5?start=40,2.404,2.404,2.404,2.404,2.404

0,Kendall T.,"Abilene, TX",6,21,7.0,2.0,2014-12-22,"This restaurant has gone downhill fast. Just recently, a few from the kitchen staff were let go because of a group photo where one actually mooned the camera in the kitchen. Our last visit was not a good experience either. It was tough to get a table (we were a party of 5+1 child). Our waitress was not available to take our order, so another waitress attempted to help us. It took several minutes to get our order placed. Then we only got partial portions of our meal.  Meals that had fries, were returned 3 times because they were cold. After eating part of our meal, because the rest did not show up till late, we had a visit from the manager. He advised he was new from another restaurant from South Texas, and asked if we wanted a free desert. That was the best he could do to make up for our poor experience. We hesitated to pay the ticket, but did with no gratuity.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-abilene-5?start=20,2.472,2.472,2.472,2.472,2.472

Always a waiting line, but open seating in the bar allows us to slip right in.

The jalapenos were on top rather than inside and they really were not that hot.  They are consistently good although they are never exactly the same.  I guess that is because they are freshly made there in the kitchen.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-abilene-5,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997
7,Carrie B.,"Abilene, TX",18,53,12.0,2.0,2015-07-01,This Chilis has gotten worse over the years. Honestly if you want Chilis in Abilene go to the north side one off I20 and HWY 351. Much better service. This one you can expect to wait an hour for your food. This visit we waited at the hostess station for 5 minutes with no hostess in dire. Finally the bartender came over and sat us. Our food then took an hour to get to the table. Last time we came here we had placed a to go order and when we came to pick up they were out of salad. How does that happen?  They were nice and sent our order to the other Chilis though. Anyways the other Chilis even if out of your way is way worth it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-abilene-5?start=20,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003

The place is dirty, the service is awful, and the food horrible.  Decided to try it again since this town is limited on restaurants. Didn't think it could be worse then a few months ago. I was wrong. Took over a hour to get our food. Took over 15 min to even have our drink order taken. Dirty glasses, dirty silverware, from the table we could watch the cooks outside smoking, which is really gross.

12,Shelly S.,"Eastland, TX",22,14,,1.0,2015-09-15,"We waited for awhile before a waitress finally came and seated us, after the bartender yelled towards the kitchen for someone to come up. She seated us at a dirty table that was too little to fit two plates on. Another waitress was getting ready for a party next to us by dragging the tables and chairs across the floor, one by one. I don't think she could have made any more noise if she tried. The food is mediocre here, at best.

5,Larry W.,"Tucumcari, NM",27,7,,4.0,2015-12-19,"Stopped in while traveling through. The wait staff was friendly and pretty attentive considering there was a large table she was also taking care of. Overall the restaurant needed a little cleaning there were dirty tables (floor included) near by which was likely a result of the server being busy. When our order was delivered I mentioned that the tea tasted funny and requested a water instead, the tea remained on my bill and we needed to get going so I didn't have a chance to ask them to remove it. I think if I had asked my server rather than another server it would have been removed, she likely didn't communicate the change to my server.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-abilene-5?start=20,,,,,

The waitress was very nice and attentive. She checked on us often. For the first time EVER, everyone's food was nice and hot when it came out. I didn't know the southwestern eggrolls could be nice and crispy because every time I've ever ordered them they were soggy and Luke warm at best.

31,Barbara T.,"Abilene, TX",47,67,71.0,4.0,2016-04-14,"Wednesday night, I downloaded the app to get call ahead seating.  Easy.  We were seated within minutes of entering.  Our friendly  waitress showed up soon thereafter to get our drink order. We all get Dr Pepper,  as their tea isn't much to brag on.  My son ordered the chili dip in a skillet  n chips.  She quickly returned with correct drinks and said appetizer.  Son ordered the chicken quesadillas,  husband orders ribs, fries, and is convinced to up size the little mini molten for the full size for $2 difference.  I ordered the mango talapia, sub corn on cob for rice.  By the time the appetizer is devoured, our food arrives hot. The quesadilla has chicken that appears to be shredded,  not fajita style, with scant cheese.  The ribs are not very meaty. But mama is very happy with the VERY SPICY glaze on the cooked right fish topped with a mango jalapeno relish, bright green broccoli,  and tender, juicy corn on the cob. The green salad I snagged from my nonveggie eating son was topped with a small amount of cheese, dressing,  and croutons.  We got the dessert to go, which turned out to be a large, tender, chocolate bundt cake with a gooey chocolate center, a side of vanilla ice cream,  with caramel,  and melted chocolate crackle topping.  Our waitress was great and the food satisfied .  The only complaint was the crying toddler at the next table, who occasional screams tore at our nerves. Been there, done that, so to a point, I can tolerate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-abilene-5,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88

Hostess hardly friendly at all and didn't even ask about a children's menu. The floor was quite gross but someone was going around trying to get everything up. Nobody even asked us for drinks for about 10-15 min. Then that took a while to get. Appetizer came pretty quick but the guacamole was flavorless and the salad was nothing more than juice in a bowl. Half and hour later, still no food. Sigh. Not even our soups came until she realized she forgot them as she delivered our meals... After 35 min. Waitress was friendly enough but overall, I think they are having a bad day. We are now all done and I will say that...

I shortly needed more water for this soon after. 2 men sat at a table next to me about 10 minutes after I did. They were so flirt serviced for tips I was ignored. I always leave a 20% tip, but when I went to pay In the table machine I was asked how the service was. It was terrible & I said so & for the first time I thought she didn't even need a terrible tip. So I wrote that on the payment machine. Well, something happened to the machine & she had to do the ticket herself & saw my remarks. It was obviously unappreciated by her & she let me know it by her upset look on her face when she gave me the ticket to sign. She doesn't deserve to be in this business.

Chili's, like most, don't particularly care about one or two customers because of the business they bring.  Over 13 minutes and no drinks, we canceled and continued to dine. When we received our bill it showed a comp for drinks. One normally takes them off the bill but to comp shows no fault on Chili's behalf.  It is my opinion this is becoming the norm for franchise restaurants.

We let our waiter know then my husband got a glass of wine and I ordered an extra spicy Bloody Mary. Of course his wine was great but my bloody Mary tasted like water downed tomato juice. Not spicy at all. I had a Bloody Mary there earlier that day with my friend and it was fantastic! Super spicy and strong. Disappointed to say the least for my dinner date with my hubby. We sat in the bar area and it was super loud also between the football games and a fan yelling at every touchdown and his little kids yelling and scraping thier chairs loudly on the tile.
