My friends had the appetizer trio and fajitas; everyone was satisfied and said they would get the same meal again. Bathroom and dining area clean and one guy was sweeping nonstop. The only problem: the DNA issue. I cringe when I see servers or bartenders doing anything that might get their DNA in my food or drinks. If I managed any food establishment I would aways ask them to never eat or drink in clear view of customers or touch your face/hair while serving them. Wash hands frequently.

I find it humorous every time I go it looks like they've created a new menu but it always the same stuff with new pictures.  I've never had a problem with the food at this Chili's but to be fair I don't go to a Chili's expecting a fine dining experience (and to be fair their price point doesn't reflect that either). Chili's is doing a ""new"" thing and having you place your refills and pay for your meal from a computer screen directly placed on your table. I think. The service at this location is reflecting this change. Although the service wasn't bad it wasn't exceptionally either (but again to be fair if I worked here I would not hustle for my tip because of how they have the computers at the tables set up).  In a nutshell quality food at a quality price but if you're feeling like having something special or frankly healthy Chili's might not be your best option.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-alexandria-3?start=20,3.04,3.04,3.04,2.572,3.0400000000000005

I liked how the platter came with 3 different sauces, though (in which one contained 2 of the Crispy Cheddar Bites already taking a dip :P! We also shared a couple of the Molten Chocolate Cake, which looked like a mini volcano of chocolate cake, topped with vanilla ice cream (that was covered with a thin chocolate shell), drizzled with fudge - this was pretty delicious, as the cake itself was very moist, and the ratio of the ice cream to the cake was pretty good.  Our server was Kathy, who was very nice.  However, during the lunch rush, the kitchen does get backed up, so we did wait for some time in receiving our orders.  In addition, we had to wait a while to get a check, because our server went a little MIA at the end.  I am not sure if I'd come back to this location, as there is a TGI Friday's up Route 1 that serves fresher food.   +tablet-ordering system at each table +lunch/appetizer deals +Molten Chocolate Cake +HH +MIA service",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-alexandria-3,3.12,3.12,3.12,2.636,3.1200000000000006

They even ordered additional food as they were eating and got that food before we received any part of our meal. There were six of them, all teenagers and it was obvious they were friends with the waiter. So we sat there listening to a bunch of teenagers cuss and talk nonsense for an entire hr before I had enough and told my friend let's walk out but my friend was so mad and hungry after driving 7hrs that she asked to speak to the manager. I decided to give 3 stars because while we waited forever to get the little food we ordered...the manager was pleasant and apologized when my friend spoke to her, and said our ticket would be on the house....the waitress while pleasant, never came back to ask if we wanted our drinks refilled nor did she offer any explanation for why we were still waiting and she also failed to  ask us if we wanted anything else....in which we actually wanted desert for the kids and another drink. We were aggravated and upset but spoke to the manager with respect and she was understanding of our frustrations. The food was hot and it was good. Overall, I won't return...I can't see waiting 1.5 for a burger and desert again. Kudos to the manager though, she handled the situation by taking responsibility and she even made sure we got our food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-alexandria-3,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12
