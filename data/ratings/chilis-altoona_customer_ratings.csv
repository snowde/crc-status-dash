19,Matthew U.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2086,1447,650.0,2.0,2012-03-10,"My recent visit was by far the worst visit I have ever had at any Chili's location. Upon arrival we were told that since we did not call ahead to reserve a table we would have to wait. Once we were seated they attempted to sit 8 fully grown adults and a baby into a corner booth. Even though there were tables available to move like they did for the call ahead people, which they conveniently were able to provide another table so that their party of 12 could grow. The bathrooms were like walking into a swamp. the urinal was freely overflowing to the point that over half the bathroom floor was wet. Very unsanitary, quite an infection control issue. The only good parts of my meal were the water I drank and the salad that didn't take them long to prepare. The only thing hot, which I am using loosely here, it was more like lukewarm, was the broccoli that was probably just pulled out of a warming plate. My Monterrey chicken was cold, the bacon wasn't crisp, the mashed potatoes were dry with a nice coating of cold gravy that kind of reminded me of being served gravy flavored ice cream, that's how NOT warm it was. Then to be charged the 18% tip because it was suggested for our party was more of an insult to me than a tip to them. The server, Sheena, was excellent; the food, hostess, management and timeliness was not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-altoona,,,,,
0,Stephanie L.,"Gallitzin, PA",3,43,14.0,4.0,2013-07-12,"We eat here frequently, especially when we want a guarantee of good food and good service. It's never a crapshoot; this location is a guarantee of a drama-free experience.  Food is standard fare for the chain, presented well and it comes out of the kitchen at a good pace. I've never been here that they've foisted your entree on you before you've finished your starters.  Mixed drinks are very good (not watered down) and the wait staff are knowledgeable about the food menu and bar menu. The staff here is particularly friendly to kids, which is a real plus for our family.  Good parking but a busy front strip where people speed so park on the sides. Call ahead works well for busy times, generally Fri & Sat and during Steelers games.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-altoona,,,,,
18,Tim W.,"Lancaster, PA",16,634,819.0,5.0,2014-10-04,"I love this Chili's restaurant and they make some great flame broiled burgers.  The service here was always great and the drinks were strong which is why I'm giving the 5-star rating.  If I'm ever in the area again, I will go to Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-altoona,,,,,
12,Jimmy H.,"Martinsburg, PA",5,4,,3.0,2015-01-19,"I used to consider this establishment a 4-star restaurant.  Times have changed.  Instantly you are greeted with sorrow at the door.  The girl is obviously more concerned with Facebook than work.  You can see it in her jowls.  Bravo for abstaining from the Samsung Galaxy.  This is the kind of service that should be expected from a greeter with such a low wage for such a demanding position of required attitude.  Compare this to the annoyance of ""welcome to Walmart.""  A+ The waiter gave an above-average performance -- Not bad for a Monday night.  $5 tip plus the change for you sir. B+ The employees themselves were exceptional for a quick-food joint.  I would've expected, at least a little nose residue or droopy eyes, but no, this is America and a damn fine one at that.  I was without a doubt impressed by their performances. A- The place loses its appeal once you are greeted with the sudden realization that their menu has changed.  This is not good. (See the Cuban Chicken at Panera -- once a classical favorite, but now missing from all space & time for no reason -- replaced by the BLT, for the love of Crice.  Change is unwarranted.  Bring back the jalapeño burger and pizza!   C- The worst of all obscenities comes when an order is placed.  ""I'm sorry, we are out of guacamole.""  ""Also out of cornbread.""  ""We don't have peppers either.""  ""Oh sorry about that, we are even out of Pico de Gallo.""  Excuse me, but how exactly do you run out of Pico de Gallo!??  That's the equivalent of Home Depot running out of hammers.  Imagine driving 30 minutes only to find out Texas Roadhouse has run out of floor peanuts.   D- Speaking of the devil, Chillies is an excellent place when the Roadhouse parking lot has filled up with decoy cars & customers.  Go in once: they're never that busy.  Imagine how much better the place would be without all that birthday singing on every visit, but that's for another review. Chillies itself is in fact a quality plot of enjoyment.  Stop by for a load of appetizers and tasty food.  Be warned, they'll ask if you're up for dessert.  ""Oh, no thank you,"" we always say.  And it's back home to the Misses.   Chillies has the potential to be 4-stars once again, but the new, alternate menu is a little too intimidating for my tastes.  I would even consider 5-stars for your liking, but the fact that the only TV I can see is Skip Bayless talking on mute.  For once I would like to be seated in front of a Penguins game, or at least Sportscenter replays.  Once it was Olympic curling.   C- but I watched it anyway.  Then forgot to look at the menu again.  ""Do you still need more time to decide?""  Yes.  Yes, please.  Oh, and I said no lemon in this water, thanks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-altoona,,,,,
17,Briana W.,"Roaring Spring, PA",1,18,16.0,5.0,2015-02-16,"Went here for Valentine's Day this year, I got a sirloin steak with skillet potatoes and corn on the cob. Everything was delicious and my steak was done perfect. We finished it off with the skillet chocolate chip cookie, it's incredible. Not to mention our food took only minutes to be prepared, great service and food!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-altoona,,,,,
13,Tyler M.,"Virginia Beach, VA",2,5,,1.0,2015-04-16,"Every time I've gone I've had absolutely horrible service. Takes at least 10 minutes just to get our drinks, rarely offers us refills, our food takes forever and we get unlimited nachos and they never get refilled! I've gone back several times because the food is good and to try and give them redemption but they just suck at serving",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-altoona,,,,,
16,Suzanne Y.,"Huntingdon, PA",40,5,,5.0,2015-05-25,"Went here for lunch on a Monday, not too busy which was great for having kids. The Texas Cheese fries are my favorite and the sweet and smokey burger was wonderful!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-altoona,,,,,
10,Josh H.,"Las Vegas, NV",23,21,67.0,4.0,2015-09-20,It's a Chili's so everyone should know what it is! Good place to eat and good new menu options. The new Fresco salad was yummy!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-altoona,,,,,
14,Randy B.,"Altoona, PA",2,6,,5.0,2015-11-29,"I really enjoy eating here. Most of the food is great including the Texas cheese fries and the shrimp tacos! :) also good are the flatbread pizza, honey chipotle chicken, and big mouth bites. I don't drink alcohol but all the drinks are very tempting. Prices are pretty good compared to other similar restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-altoona,,,,,
15,James S.,"Bellwood, PA",0,7,,5.0,2016-01-01,"Had the enchiladas, they were awesome. Our server Molly was very attentive, probably the best service I've received in several years. Very nice dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-altoona,,,,,
11,Shelly S.,"Altoona, PA",48,77,7.0,2.0,2016-08-01,"I'm not a fan of Chili's, but my husband was hungry and it was right there, so we went. It continues to go downhill. Our server wasn't busy, but she seemed like she was. I mean having 2 tables and the one was paying their bill when we sat down, doesn't seem busy to me. I ordered a burger and my husband had Cajun chicken & shrimp pasta. My burger came out and the lettuce look like it should have been thrown away months ago. My Fries were cold and looked like they should have been thrown away. My husband asked for no tomatoes or onions, and it comes out warm, with tomatoes and onions. He didn't say anything, but he wasn't happy. When I was finished with my meal and out of water for awhile, she comes over and asked if I'd like more water. She never pre-bussed the table at all, until she brought us our check. When we got home we both felt sick. We left the server a great tip though. We both have served, so we tip right, she might have been having an off day. I always say that I will never come back, well I won't be coming back this time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-altoona,,,,,
9,Matthew B.,"Altoona, PA",0,43,1.0,5.0,2016-08-28,By far best ribs in town! All of their other foods are great as well! Great service great cleanliness I will def be eating here again!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-altoona,,,,,
7,P S.,"Bellwood, PA",0,18,,1.0,2016-10-15,"We had a decent dinner at Chili's.  However,  WATCH OUT if using the trivia device at your table.    If you use the device for anything,  they try to sneak in a $1.99 charge for ""entertainment.""    This is an absolutely deceptive ripoff!!   Chili's  should be ashamed of this OUTRAGEOUS  attempt to  pad your bill.  We will not be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-altoona,,,,,
6,Preet K.,"Columbus, OH",0,2,,1.0,2017-04-08,If I can rate this zero stars I would. The service and food presentation was horrendous. Made me lose my appetite.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-altoona,,,,,
4,Alex S.,"Altoona, PA",40,268,69.0,3.0,2017-05-08,"Well I can't say this is the worst experience I've had at a chain, but it ranks up there. Came here on a Saturday late afternoon, a little before 4PM. I figured that would be the best bet on a Saturday, and the parking lot was pretty empty. However, when we walked in, we were told there was going to be a ten minute wait anyway, with only one group of three ahead of us. There was quite a few empty tables, but they were dirty and it appeared as if no one was concerned with cleaning them. When we finally were seated, the waiter barely paid us any mind besides to take our food and drink orders. The only reason I'm giving three stars is because the food still came out in a timely manner and tasted good. I've never had issues like this before, so hopefully this was just a one time fluke.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-altoona,,,,,
8,Casey W.,"Roaring Spring, PA",0,5,,2.0,2017-05-23,The food was pretty good we got the Wisconsins fried cheese bites which were pretty good and our entrée where pretty good except my corn on cob was like mushy rubbery kinda and not very good but other then food was excellent. The service kinda disappointed me we asked for chips and salsa 2x to two different waitresses before we got it and she didn't check in with us much at all so I said the service was below par,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-altoona,,,,,
5,Benjamin T.,"Stony Brook, NY",0,4,,1.0,2017-10-21,"I have come to this restaurant twice. The experience I had before was that the food comes out way to slow. This time this wasn't the case. Instead I realized that the server I had (Stephanie) was extremely rude. She didn't seem to care for us at all. She took our orders and then visited us once to ask me for a refill, which I am very glad. She did not have a smile on her face nor talked in a pleasant tone. I'm starting to think she's racist because I was with my Chinese friends. Come on, at least make an effort to act like you like your job. When we asked for separate checks she rolled her eyes shook her head and laughed. We asked to split it between 3 cards which isn't that tedious of a task. If one signs up for the job such as a waitress, a positive attitude and the willingness to serve his or her customers should be present at all times. Olive gardens service is great, and so is red lobster. Today, it might've been just the waitress, but through this experience I wouldn't want to come back, I honestly lost my appetite. Chili's, I love you, but please invest more time selecting waitresses, especially people like these. Thanks",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-altoona,,,,,
2,Mike K.,"Altoona, PA",4,31,13.0,3.0,2017-10-28,Chilis is usually good and the food was fine. However it was something else to see two of the wait staff fight over who had to be stuck with my wife and I.  Once the loser of The Who-wants-to-talk-to-us-contest had to talk to us she rushed through our order cutting my wife off and barely taking a second to listen to my simple request of requesting a different dipping sauce.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-altoona,,,,,
1,Kyle T.,"Duncansville, PA",90,14,3.0,3.0,2017-11-19,"Now why I ordered a burrito when I could have crossed the street and gotten one from Chipotle, I do not know.  This is far from what the picture shows on the menu. The beans were cold, the chicken was barely flavored but the waitress was a gem. She asked how the food was, I answered with above written and she was very apologetic. She gave us another entree even though I had already eaten half of the first one. The second one was hot but still bland.  What I am trying to say that everyone probably already knows is, get Mexican-style food at a Mexican restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-altoona,,,,,
3,Rick B.,"Altoona, PA",0,28,1.0,2.0,2017-12-15,Pictures look good flavor on mex side isnt there. Meats are okay. But cadillac style adds no flavor. Flavor has soaked out. And they arent real fond when you tell them about it. Get chipotle for flavor or don patron for relax good food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-altoona,,,,,
