25,Gavin E.,"Deltona, FL",7,12,3.0,1.0,2012-01-20,"Good atmosphere. Staff are nice enough, and that's where the compliments stop. I ordered bone in buffalo wings and blackened chicken sliders. I got boneless chicken nuggets, which i returned and while i was waiting for the wings my main course came?  The only resemblance of the sliders to the menu description was it was chicken. Otherwise nothing the menu said was on the plate was actually there. The fries, which it wasn't supposed to come with, we're so salty it ruined the sliders and the wings. By the way the wings came half way through the meal. This is the 3rd time I've been here to give It a chance, but never again.  Do yourself a favor and either go somewhere else, or next door to chateau which is ok at best",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-andover?start=20,1.924,1.924,1.924,1.924,1.9240000000000002
29,Darryl A.,"Fairfax, VT",0,3,,2.0,2012-04-05,"Nasty.  Picked up take out from here.  The ingredients used were of very poor quality. The ""bacon"" on my cheeseburger was more like fried fat strips, lettuce was shriveled and not crisp. The burger itself was over cooked and dried out, as were the chicken wings.  I think their M.O. is to just slather everything with a ridiculous amount of sauces and hope that the customers will not notice. I will not be back, nor would I recommend it to anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-andover?start=20,2.056,2.056,2.056,2.056,2.056

22,Frannie Z.,"Haverhill, MA",24,378,37.0,3.0,2013-01-21,"Chili's makes good nachos. Chili's makes good nachos? Chili's makes good nachos! I've never before gotten the nachos at Chili's so (as you can see) I am mildly surprised that they do a good job. Although I will admit seeing single nachos lined up around the edge of the plate was a bit disappointing, I got over it quickly. I realized that each and every one of these nachos has exactly the perfect amount of topping PLUS the tortilla was still crispy. I must say, I would prefer 12 absolutely perfect nachos to a plate full of no cheese on the bottom, toppings falling off nachos. I seem to have more difficulty with either the service or the space at Chili's than the actual food. Last time at a different location we had a loony waitress. This time, the waiter was awesome but they stuck our group in the bar. Now, mind you, we were there at 5PM and the dining room was empty. They had a huge double booth that would have fit the 7 of us just fine. The bar was so loud I couldn't hear the people at the other end of the table. By the end of the night I had a headache from having to talk so loud to be heard. I guess my tips would be: 1. Get the nachos 2. Don't sit in the bar unless you have earplugs 3. Keep your expectations low",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-andover?start=20,2.1879999999999997,2.1879999999999997,2.1879999999999997,2.1879999999999997,2.1879999999999997

17,Kartik P.,"Atlanta, GA",52,193,78.0,4.0,2013-11-12,"Its chilis. Its where you find good enough burritos, nachos, mexican fix, burger fix and drink fix.  I must admit though, that I have been loyal to chilis as far as time goes. Have almost tried everything on their menu and like most of the items. Its not a great culinary experience, but it is satisfying both pocket wise and stomach wise. Above average portion sizes and drink sizes. Like their choco lava cake to finish things off. If you going to dine alone and late, this might provide a good deal during their happy hour.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-andover,,,,,
15,Bill B.,"South El Monte, CA",638,409,2442.0,5.0,2014-01-25,Visited this restaurant two evenings in a row while on business travel. The front desk team and the lady who took my to go order were very professional friendly extremely conscientious. I Was offered a complimentary drink when I waited for my to go order in the bar. The bar has some very cool dark blue neon lighting. I had salmon which was a huge portion perfectly great Grilled and seasonsed to perfection. This the first Chili's that actually placed my side orders to go in separate containers that's a major league plus. Normally Chiles just carelessly slops them them in the to go container. The large size to go drinks are much greater in quantity then if you order in. My side dishes were piping hot firm perfectly prepared. The restrooms were spotless the dining in seating areas were neat and clean. Music is kind of corny that's why we have headphones,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-andover,,,,,

She was rude and kept disappearing. She seemed like she couldn't even be bothered with us. It took a very long time to get our food and when we wanted to order dessert, we had to ask another waitress to find our waitress. When we got our bill we learned that she had overcharged us for a meal and when asked to correct it she fixed it and said ""I fixed your bill"" and mumbled under her breath ""even though it was only 99 cents"". I know its not a significant amount but it was her error and she shouldn't be rude to the customer. It will be the last time I dine at the Andover location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-andover?start=20,,,,,

It was delicious! We got the sampler fajitas and chipotle salad, everything was hot fresh and flavorful (I do wish we got more of the sides and guacamole though). The best part was definitely the freshly baked chocolate chip cookie in a pan with ice cream on top. Amazing! Service was pretty fast and I love that we could pay at the touch screen on the table.

28,Robert C.,"Andover, MA",0,4,,2.0,2015-06-03,"The only reason I am even giving them 2 stars is for the fact that I know the food is good.  Living in Andover, i was hoping to find a nice place with awesome ribs (as they always are at chilis) close to home.  Came in at 6:30 not busy, not crowded at all.  Were seated immediately by a very friendly host and it seemed like any other, awesome chilis experience.  We sat, figured out drinks and what we wanted for food (after 15 years combined serving and bartending my girlfriend and I like to be fast and decisive).  We waited and talked for a few minutes, watching all the servers walk by us, look at us, and ignore us. At 6:45, i started getting agitated by the fact we hadn't even be greeted by out server yet.  Another 15 minutes rolls by and we called it quits.  We drove 7 minutes up to the chilis in salem nh.  There are Over double the amount of people here, and yet in 3 minutes we have cold beers, and our food order in.  Don't bother at the Andover chilis, take the 10 minutes to go to salem, wilmington or reading.  Youll save a lot of time and aggravation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-andover?start=20,,,,,

16,Jesse J.,"Lowell, MA",0,38,10.0,2.0,2015-07-28,"Slipped in for a working lunch. Chili's is attached to a hotel, in this very, very business-oriented area-- I think there are 6 office parks within 2 miles. It was quiet-- no one at the bar and only about 3 other tables were occupied.  Pulled out my laptop, looked for WiFi network ... Huh? None??? EVERY Chili's has WiFi. What the heck is going on here? Ok, no big deal. My company gives me an air card for use.  But I'm low on juice... I looked around again-- not a single outlet under any table whatsoever??!  You've got to be kidding me.  I inquired of the waitress  she seemed to agree. ""I have no idea why we're not set up with wifi. It makes no sense to me either,"" she replied.  Lunch was ok-- Mexican taco salad of some sort-- but uncomfortable and rushed. I had to get back to work. :-(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-andover,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72
10,Jenni L.,"St Pete Beach, Tampa Bay, FL",219,408,237.0,1.0,2015-08-13,"I'm a big fan of the Chili's chain of restaurants, but this is one of the worst experiences I've ever had.  We were staying at the adjacent hotel and decided to stop over for a ""quick"" dinner after a long day on the road. Ha! It was clear as soon as we walked in that they were understaffed. It took over 5 minutes for someone to greet us and show us to our table.  Our server kept forgetting what we ordered to drink - came back twice to confirm what we got.  We shared the 2-for-20 meal. It literally took 30 minutes for our appetizer to come out. We thought maybe the server forgot to put in our order, but she was nowhere to be found to ask her. When she finally came out with it, she just dropped it on the table and walked away without saying anything to us at all. Rude!  Our meal came after another ridiculously long wait and both chicken dishes tasted bland and rubbery. Not at all like they usually do. Drink refills were painfully slow.  I understand that it's not always the servers fault for being understaffed or for the kitchen being backed up, but it's still not appropriate to be rude. An apology for the wait or even a little compassion would have gone a long way. Wasted two hours of our life and over $50. Will never return to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-andover,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68

Chili's serves hot wellprepared Tex Mex food, tasty in a comfortable relatively quiet environment. But food is only one component of a dining night out.

12,Craig S.,"Tewksbury, MA",41,46,,1.0,2016-05-15,"UNDERSTAFFED, COLD FOOD DELIVERED 45 MINUTES AFTER BEING ORDERED, OVERWORKED WAIT STAFF, MANAGEMENT THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO CARE WHAT PEOPLE THINK - OR WHAT THEIR EXPERIENCE MIGHT BE. My wife and I had a terrible experience last night when we went out to dinner at our local, Chili's Grill and Bar on River Road in Andover, MA (your #1068).   We arrived at 7:30 and saw that the restaurant was not full - probably 60% full with a few larger parties waiting for tables.  We weren't seated right away because the greeter said that the tables needed to be cleaned.  OK - after 10 minutes, she did seat us.   And after being seated, there we sat for 20 min,. before our server came over and asked us if we wanted anything to drink?  We ordered wine - two glasses - one Merlot, the other Pino Giorgio.  Then we waited, and waited, and waited for our drinks - AND TO PLACE AN ORDER.   It was at least another twenty-five minutes before the server came back order to take our order.  My wife ordered the Mango Chicken - I ordered the Fajitas (spell?).  We asked about the wine that we still hadn't received.   The server then told us that they were ""short handed"" and begged our ""forgiveness"".   The wine finally arrived after another 10 minutes.  And the food we ordered didn't arrive until I got mad enough to get up, speak with the greeter and ask to speak with the manager who came over and said ""short staffed, very sorry, apologies"" and rushed off.   We still didn't get our meals.  Finally after another 5 minutes, the food arrived DELIVERED BY THIS MANAGER.  Interesting enough, the food arrived VERY COLD, and flavorless.  I tried to get the manager's attention about the cold food.  He avoided us every time he ""flew"" by with other people's ""probably cold"" food. This manager is a disaster and his lack of management and customer service skills suggest he should be terminated.  He's shooting himself and his restaurant unit in the foot because no one who might read this and the other Yelp Reviews are likely to return.  Remember on a Saturday night at 7:30 the restaurant was 40% empty.  NO WONDER.  Who would want to duplicate this kind of experience?  No one I know. I have sent a copy of this review to CHILI'S.  Who knows if they'll even read it.  I doubt it for some reason.  God help other restaurant visitors to this unit if their experience is anything like ours.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-andover,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
11,Bryan S.,"Memphis, TN",22,17,1.0,1.0,2016-05-30,"I'm sorry guys I tried. I really did (3 times!) because your takeout folks are pretty nice and I wanted a place to eat during my 6 week work trip. But it gets worse every time and today my food was inedible. First try: ordered one of the fish plates with double fish. It was an unusual order apparently so I asked to just get 2 to save time and simplify. Refused said he didn't want me to overpay. Okay. Was told 15 minutes. Gave em 25 just in case. Waited another 30 passed that until finally the takeout dude told me they forgot about my order and left it out. He seemed genuine and said it was fine now and he even scolded the cooks! Took it home only to find that it was ICE COLD. I was starving so I forced it down.  Next try a little less eventful except that they forgot the rice and double meat... figured they were getting better, at least now I got warm food. Tried one more time. Super simple just give me a steak, medium. Now I'm looking at a piece of raw meat as I hungrily write this review. I'm not talking pink rare-this piece is cold and purple throughout except for the most outer layer. Even the fries are stale. :( Sorry I'm done.

The hostess who greeted us was not friendly at all and gave us attitude right off the bat. We get seated and have to wait 15 minutes along with another family that walked in right in front of us. After waiting, my brother in law got up to look for someone to help us, but couldn't find anyone. We asked the first waiter we saw since we came in and he quickly got defensive and said ""I ain't yo waiter!"" and we said"" Excuse me sir? We have been waiting for the past 15 minutes and have not been served yet, is there anyone here who could help us?"" ""Like I said I aint yo waiter"" ""Well can you please find someone?"" ""Fine!"". We walked right out as did the other family that arrived with us. They actually waited longer than us since we were already out on the parking lot when they came out.  Honestly worst service ever.
