2,Brandon B.,"New York, NY",0,2,,1.0,2015-01-01,"One of the grossest meals I've ever had.  Was forced to go here because it's New Year's Day and we couldn't find anything else that was open.  Food was really bad and it came out very cold.  Service was pretty poor.  Margaritas weren't bad at all, but they are quite pricey.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-apodaca,,,,,

I am here for 3 weeks and no doubt will be back since it is in walking distance from the MTY hotel enclave and was good enough for another visit. Had the fried pickles app, bountiful and delicious as you might expect from anything deep fried, the Buffalo chicken sandwich, and 2 ice cold Tecate drafts. Ready for a fried food induced coma nap.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-apodaca,,,,,
1,M L.,"Littleton, CO",9,97,20.0,1.0,2016-06-03,"I haven't eaten at a Chilis in over 9 years after getting sick from a burger. Against my better judgment, I gave this one a try. My drink shows up with something floating on top. I don't know what the hell that was. I decided to try the chicken on this venture. It was like trying to chew leather. Two tiny bites of that and I was out of there. I took an Imodium for good measure and 24 hours later all systems are still normal. Whew...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-apodaca,,,,,
