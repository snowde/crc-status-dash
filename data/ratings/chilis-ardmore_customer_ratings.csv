11,Jay C.,"Gainesville, TX",1,12,,1.0,2015-04-26,"I've now eaten here twice, and can honestly say that I will never eat here again. They have a new menu across the board at all their restaurants, so simply avoiding the Ardmore location won't do me any good.   To be fair, the service is good, but the food is just awful. On our first trip to the newest location in Ardmore, I ordered a burger and fries. Can't go wrong with the old standard, right? Wrong! The fries were okay, but the burger was a sad creation indeed, not to mention overpriced.  Decided to give them a second shot, but this time I opted for steak fajitas. Worst, and I do mean the worst fajitas I've ever had. The portion size is ludicrous and on top of that, they put maybe the worst sauce on it known to man, so I used a napkin to dab it off and finished the meagre portion of steak left on my plate. And by the way, this hideous dinner was almost $16! Not a bad price if they were edible and  much, much bigger. Whatever happened to Chili's, it isn't good. I can truly say that for me, this is the worst restaurant in Ardmore. You want a burger, go to Interurban, and for a good fajita, either Casa Romo or El Tapatio. If you happen upon Chili's of Ardmore, just keep on driving.  Chili's, go back to your old menu and make your restaurant worth visiting again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ardmore,,,,,
13,Riki P.,"Bethany, OK",13,6,,4.0,2015-04-28,"I've been here several times. I'm not accustomed to the old menu at chili's, so no comparisons there. I love tex mex so that's what I get, and it's been good each time. I feel like I got a lot of food, it tasted fresh. The queso dip is very yummy. The wait staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and prompt,. I knocked them down a star because I got a cold molten lava cake once, and the kitchen forgot the avocados on a dish that was supposed to have it, but the wait staff handled both incidents satisfactorily. Overall, good experience. I will go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ardmore,,,,,
7,Jackie M.,"San Antonio, TX",12,8,2.0,5.0,2015-11-29,"This review is educated to our server, Alex. We jut stopped in for a break and a bite, driving from Kansas City home to San Antonio.  He found a way to make us smile and laugh, even though we were exhausted from the road trip with out 1 yr old, who he showered with attention.  Having been in the service industry for many years, I've realized great servers are hard to come by and Alex is one of them. Makes me wish we'd make the drive more often just to stop in and say hello.  Of course the food was good, consistent as ever. Just really enjoyed the company. Thanks, Alex, if you're reading!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ardmore,,,,,
3,Cheri Y.,"Navarre, FL",5000,509,9794.0,4.0,2015-12-28,"This chilis just opened a few months ago & hubby & I decided to check out the burgers & wings they offer.  I had never been to a chilis b4 so I can't comment on the old menu, however the current menu has some yummy stuff! :)'  Hubby & I have been in several times now & we both LOVE the table side guac. Super fresh giant whole avocados you can either mash yourself or they will do it for you. It comes with chips & salsa.  The smokey wings are also fantastic. They are not fried, just smoked. LOVE these.  The burgers are yummy too. They actually have a build a burger menu so you can get them anyway you want them. You can order a regular patty, two thin patties, a turkey burger patty or a black bean veggie patty & add your toppings. They come with seasoned fries in a little metal basket that keeps them hot & crispy. LOVE! :)) The Margaritas are BOMB too & we also love the tablet at the table. When we get ready to go we can just pay & bolt. Super convenient.  Every time we have been there we have had excellent service. Sitting in the bar area is the best Bc they have some really big tv's to catch the game & the booths are very comfy.  We Love the new chilis. It's our new fave bar, burger & wing place in the area :)  Recommend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ardmore,,,,,
4,Phillip D.,"Mansfield, TX",90,249,193.0,3.0,2016-01-12,"First of all, it is a Chili's. A chain. Plain Jane chain. However, I am trying to eat healthy (NOT a NY resolution. Been at this a while.) and I know I can eat here under 600 calories. Most of the top-rated restaurants in town were either bad choices for the diet or really mixed reviews. I sat at the bar and the service was a little slow. The bartender was solo and was slammed, so I'm OK with it. Besides, two irrelevant BBALL games were on & the NFL Network. Fortunately NOT the State of Confusion speech. Even the NBA is riveting by comparison. Ordered Ancho Salmon w/o rice and w/double broccoli. My usual. They overdid the salmon-crispy on the bottom on one edge. The rest was right. Perfectly Edible. The broccoli was actually really good. Perfectly steamed and nicely seasoned. A manager shared some coaching with the bartender in front of customers. He did it well-but he should have done it out of earshot. Nothing really stood out. The service was fine. The food was fine. No complaints. Chains have to really Wow me to go 4 star. I don't know what would earn a chain 5 stars - it hasn't happened.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ardmore,,,,,
10,Maggie M.,"Lewisville, TX",28,5,,5.0,2016-02-01,"This was our first time at Chili's. We had a very good experience! Our server was great; we were never left wondering where she was. Menu is rather large which made deciding on a meal more challenging. Presentation was great, produce was fresh. Would definitely recommend for a date night, especially if you don't want to spend a lot of $$!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ardmore,,,,,
9,Daniel B.,"Edmond, OK",0,1,,1.0,2016-03-30,"Chilis, you F'd up. This is probably the worst chilis ever, service is horrible with the management being  even worse. I usually enjoy the food and the experience at chilis  but this is the worst dining experience I have EVER had. Once I complained to the ""so called"" manager chuck about the horrid service he proceeded to side with his servers leaving me as a dissatisfied guest to spread the word to the small amount of people in this town to never eat here unless they are looking to waste money. Ten thumbs down, negative 5 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ardmore,,,,,
12,Seymour B.,"Sulphur, OK",0,19,,4.0,2016-06-05,"Ok, been a chili's fan forever... Rode our Harley's down today for some chow, it was crowded ( understandably), and the food was pretty good.... But, when the food service is slow, and your sitting there for awhile to eat, and server comes up to you w/ excuses of cooks calling in, that's unacceptable to me... Just apologize for the wait. And end it. Excuses are unprofessional and are a disservice to the the consumer. Like I said, food was good but slow.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ardmore,,,,,
5,Ralph D.,"Grand Prairie, TX",2,30,23.0,5.0,2016-09-03,"Road trip to OKC and stop in Ardmore craving a Chili's Santa Fe Chicken Salad.....did not disappoint. In fact I intentionally go to different Chili's to check for consistency.  The grilled chicken was well prepared by the cook.  The lettuce was cool, chrisp and chopped proportional to fork serving.  Heather submitted our order perfectly.   FYI. No tortilla strips with both sauces on side keeps carbs to a minimum and lettuce doesn't get soggy.  Finally the working relationship between staff i.e. Heather 1 and Heather 2, is congenial and professional making everything look seamless.   Well done, great experience and a definite repeat visit.  Also kudos to the young man who brought our meal. Great smile and polite. Check it out folks I 35 northbound Exit 31A or just Waze it. :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ardmore,,,,,
8,Chloe B.,"Manhattan, KS",1,71,2.0,3.0,2016-11-06,It was one of the new designs of Chili's so the decor was really cool and clean. Also had the technology at the table so you could pay anytime. Our waitress was slow but pretty good otherwise. Food is about the same as every other Chili's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ardmore,,,,,
6,Sabrina J.,"Ardmore, OK",0,6,,2.0,2017-03-12,"I don't know what's going on at this Chilis but most of the staff seemed pissed off.  We waited for almost 10 minutes for a table, and only got one when I said something to the bartender.  People before us had been waiting longer and no it was not crowded or busy.  We ended up w a great waiter and my steak was actually fabulous. I was just so amazed at watching the other workers stomp around and seem so miserable, the manager had the same persona when he came out to glare at customers.  When we left, there were more people lined up to be seated. Bad atmosphere, good food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ardmore,,,,,
2,Pamela H.,"Ardmore, OK",24,1,,1.0,2017-10-24,We  have had our food for 20 minutes and are still waiting on silver wear.  Hard to eat steak with the two guacamole forks.  Bad service and ok food,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ardmore,,,,,
0,Dennis M.,"Ardmore, OK",10,62,3.0,5.0,2017-10-29,The two for $22.00 is an amazing amount of food and the chicken fajitas are more than enough. We watch our calorie intake and options are good. Our waiter was very attentive and friendly and we had no complaints whatsoever. Enjoyed the meal.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ardmore,,,,,
