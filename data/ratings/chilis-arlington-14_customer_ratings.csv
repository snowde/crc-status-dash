39,Tiger C.,"Laguna Beach, CA",65,127,,1.0,2012-02-17,"Upon entering this Chili's, I was freaked out by what was going on the moment I entered.  It was in the evening, and there were barely any people in the restaurant.  Same for the servers, barely any were visible.  Until we saw what was going on in the back of the restaurant, the servers were doing some sort of rap circle throw down.  Thought that was cool, until they just kept doing it and nobody came to serve us.  After 15 minutes, we walked out; they were still doing their flow. On another occasion, met a friend for lunch and got a burger at the bar area.  Good thing was we got served.  Not so good was the food.  Probably the most unmemorable food I have had at a Chili's before.  Not all Chili's are created equal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-arlington-14?start=40,2.96,2.96,2.96,1.8600000000000003,2.96

27,Jonathan M.,"Washington, DC",32,63,21.0,4.0,2012-03-07,"To quote a fellow Arlingtonian, ""You can call it Trans-fat. I call it happiness."" It's not that I'm low brow, or a bottom feeder... I just like a good grease bomb every now and then.  hoity toity restaurants have their place. But on a Friday Night after a long week of doing the Gov'ment's bidding, I need a place to unwind with a frosty beer mug and some fatty comfort food. There's peace in knowing that I will in no way be able to rationalize the terror that I am about to unleash on my stomach. Chili's usually keeps itself honest with this ideology, and I'm a huge fan of that.  Chili's isn't always the best at service, and the food there lacks a certain originality. But its not designed to woo you. Its designed to DESTROY you!  I came in for a Friday happy hour early and squatted on two bar tables at once. When the waiter asked me if I had a bigger group coming, I said yes, and he helped me rearrange the furniture to fit my incoming group. That was a class move, I thought. The Happy Hour here isn't bad at all...cheap drinks, low priced appetizers from the Happy Hour List. I ordered the Bacon Bigmouth Bites with ranch dressing and made sure to pester the server for more onion strings. He delivered, and with a smile. That goes a long way in my book.  It's noisy, but you know that. It's Chili's, not the Palm. I can't tell you how many times I've been to a Chili's over the years. There not all a homerun, that's for sure. But I have to say you know what you're going to get. I hope it's a massive Margarita that would make Michael Scott and the Dunder Mifflanites jealous, (and or sloshed), and the bacon Bigmouth Burger (that I immediately regretted not ordering). Ultimately, I find myself comparing every single burger I eat to something on the Chili's menu, and as Jules Winfield would say, ""That's a tasty burger"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-arlington-14?start=40,2.96,2.96,2.96,2.16,2.96

103,Samantha G.,"Chicago, IL",1090,1717,2677.0,2.0,2012-06-20,"So my mom gave me a Chili's gift card for Xmas like 2 years ago. And the BF and I were in Crystal City last weekend and trying to eat on the cheap. So that is how we wound up here - aiming for a bite to eat that would not go over $15 (the value of the gift card). The overall problem with Chili's is that they don't have good food. Seriously, the skillet queso is like the only worthy thing on their menu. Ok, maybe that's a tad harsh. It ain't all bad. But it's not exactly quality food either. The problem with this particular Chili's is the lack of service. And I do mean a serious lack of service. We sat at our table for at least 10 minutes before anyone came over. Our drinks were slow to arrive. Our food was very fast to arrive. We were checked on just once, which was immediately after our food arrived. Our check had to be flagged down. Sure, I've experienced worse. But meh, it shouldn't have been that lacking. So yeah, not a fan of this Chili's location (or really any Chili's - except for the skillet queso).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-arlington-14,2.96,2.96,2.96,1.864,2.96

Everything is pre-made, canned, frozen, and industrialized in flavor and texture.          The primary problem here is the parking....in that it's non existent. We paid 10 dollars to park for less than an hour in the adjacent garage but, when trying to leave, we told they didn't accept real people money (credit cards) so we had to re-park, then find an ATM....there were no ATMs within a mile open as they're all behind doors so we bummed $6.00 off a friend to cover the $4.00 we already had in coin.....like living in a third world country, they should be ashamed of the parking situation here.          In conclusion, dreadful.

Granted, I only order 3 ingredients (bacon, cheese, onion) on them, they are heavenly. And I go there at least once a week. I have never had bad service at this location and there has never been an issue with my food. I usually order a salad, potato skins and a strawberry mango frozen margarita and they are always perfect. (Though I imagine it'd be difficult to mess up either of those items)  The 2 for $20 or 2 for $35 (the option that includes a margarita) are the best ideas ever.

Chili's is where you want to go when you have absolutely no idea what you want to eat, and are fooled into thinking this is a good idea.  Every time I have been here, I've left dissatisfied and regret being hungry enough to walk through the door. The food is not special by any means. It's bland, tasteless, and worst of all, overpriced.  For example, the wings. Fried to produce a mediocre crispness, then bathed in a thin sauce of disappointment resembling Texas Pete hot sauce and butter. $10. Gone.  Don't let the menu pictures fool you, or the sound of the sizzling skillet. I learned the hard way by ordering chicken fajitas the other night. I mean- how do you screw up fajitas?! Well, Chili's apparently screws them up by adding zero seasoning, and upcharging you for rice and beans. They were terrible. I hated every second. $15. Gone.  So take my advice, if you're in Crystal City, and the thought of going here crosses your mind, immediately punch yourself in the face, and walk down the street to Kabob Palace.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-arlington-14?start=40,2.64,2.64,2.64,1.9280000000000002,2.64

There are enough good restaurants in this area that you shouldn't have to waste your money or allowed caloric intake at a gosh-darned Chili's. HOWEVER--that being said, this place offers something that most places in crystal city don't, which is a decent salad. I know that the salads here don't exactly qualify as health food, but sometimes you just need some greens, ya know? I've only been here twice, but I try to cut the calories by getting dressing on the side, holding the bacon, switching from fried to grilled chicken, etc. Chili's is Chili's, meaning they usually earn about a 1-star review. In this location, the pure existence of salads on their menus, combined with the fact that it holds the hours you would expect from a chain restaurant, means it gets an extra star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-arlington-14?start=40,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.248,2.44

Details if you need them: I was in town on business and staying at the hotel across the street. Not a big Chili's fan, but it was the only restaurant in sight from my hotel across the street. I stopped in 6/28/13 at about 8:30pm and the young woman working the reception was away from her station. I waited patiently. When she returned, she stepped around me and began helping the people second in line, who came in behind me. They were then seated. Uh, hello?  When she got back to me, she somewhat rudely asked if she could help me. I pointed out that I'd been there before the people she just seated, as I thought she should know. She dismissively said she didn't see me, though she had to have seen me - she actually had to vary her path to literally get *around* me - I was standing right in front of her podium! If she hadn't seen me, she would've run into me. But whatever. I asked for a table and she told me there was a 40 minute wait. What?? There was an empty table 10 feet behind her, not far inside the door. I rather stared at her, but couldn't even fathom why I'd bother to ask about it.

We didn't include a tip because we wanted to tip based on his service, given the already ridiculous delivery and service fees.  The driver was 2 hours late. He arrived a few min. ago and says we owe him cash. I said no I paid via credit card. He continues to aggressively argue with me about this. I go to get my phone to show him my emailed receipt and he interrupts ""Where is my tip."" I said ""Tip??"" He said, ""Yes I need a tip"" I had to forcefully tell him to first confirm with his manager that I indeed paid already and he proceeded to insinuate that we were trying to not pay when he called over his walkie talkie.

I told him he wasn't going to be getting one b/c he was so rude to us and had taken 2 hours to get us our food. He refused to leave until we had given him money. At this point, he was so threatening that I basically tried to shove a dollar at him (not very nice, I know, but I was so shocked by his attitude) He then decided to leave.

This was tasty too.   However when it came to entrees, I ordered the steak (classic rib eye with steamed broccoli and mashed potatoes) and was looking forward to this but our waiter brought it by and I saw his fingers touching my food... like sauce all over his fingers because his fingers were literally in my steak.  I tried eating the other side of the steak but was thoroughly disgusted at this point and didn't eat my entree.  That ruined the experience and we paid for our meal without saying anything and left.  I think the restaurant should  reevaluate its hygienic practices and instruct its employees on sanitary serving.  I doubt I would return to this Chili's, and it's a shame because I loved their drinks and the food I did eat was tasty.

Who runs this place and why are they still open??  (Btw, lived nearby is DC for 15 years and I try and come here occasionally and want to embrace this location like every other chili's - but they consistently underdeliver for everything)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-arlington-14?start=40,2.08,2.47,2.47,,2.3140000000000005

90,Claudia C.,"San Ramon, CA",425,364,444.0,3.0,2016-04-09,"3 stars for food and 4 stars for service. My friends and I came here 30 minutes before close after a long flight. Honestly, it was the only place we could find that was open around the DCA area.  At this late in the evening, we set our expectations low. We just needed some sustenance to satiate our hunger. Surprisingly though, we had a really attentive server who provided great service despite dining until 30 minutes past closing time. We got the Texas fries and onion rings as apps. Both were delicious. I'd recommend getting either or both if you're here. Where things fell relatively short was the entree. I ordered the mango tilapia which comes with brown rice and steamed vegetables on the side. Flavors were ok...the tilapia was clearly frozen and defrosted, the vegetables needed a couple more minutes of steaming and were old, and the brown rice didn't really taste like anything. Our party of four ended up leave with a bill around $50 including drinks so I can't really complain about the price. It's definitely a great place for apps and food is reasonably priced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-arlington-14,2.16,2.47,2.47,,2.3460000000000005

91,Latasha T.,"Detroit, MI",0,7,,1.0,2016-05-27,"Honestly this restaurant deserve 0 stars. I dined in at this restaurant tonight with my family while on vacation from out of state and after witnessing the server take our appetizers to the wrong table and then bring the exact order to us we knew this place was disgusting. I can understand a restaurant not wanting to waste product; however, the restaurant also expects that business goes well. And in order to achieve great results you have to put in great efforts... I asked the server politely if they could remake the order and the server was combative and argued with me. I asked to speak to the manager and he said that he was one of the mangers. Wow! Surprising, so I asked to speak with another manager. He went to the back, came back out, and apologized about his actions and said that it would be 10 minutes for a fresh order. I appreciated his apology and it made the experience a little better.  After 10 minutes a new server brought the appetizers out and I tasted the Texas style fries, and the fries tasted reheated and old: anyone who loves fries knows the difference between fresh and old fries. After realizing that the exact order was re-served to us when the walking manager came and asked how our experience was I explained the issue. He said he was a general manager from another store filling in because they were short staffed here, and he had the general manager come over and speak to us. I explained to her what we experienced and as the GENERAL MANAGER she argued with me.  I just couldn't believe how bad of a customer experience this was! I wouldn't recommend anyone to eat here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-arlington-14,2.2,2.45,2.45,,2.3500000000000005
95,Kodee M.,"Spotsylvania Courthouse, VA",90,9,,2.0,2016-06-13,"Stopped by here before work. Was seated for about 15 minutes before anyone came to us. Thought we would be smart and order drinks a food together. (Hell, we've had plenty of time to look at the menu)  The wait staff looked TERRIBLE. Everyone looked like they had been working for days nonstop. Our waitress was friendly but VERY slow. Even to just get us napkins seemed to take forever.  The two stars I give this location is to the cooks. Steak was cooked PERFECTLY. As for the bartender: a glass of whiskey isn't a mixed drink. It's just 3 shots.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-arlington-14,2.2,2.44,2.44,,2.3440000000000003
96,Christine B.,"Bowie, MD",76,92,47.0,3.0,2016-07-11,"I have never visited this location, and I am unsure if I will again. After being Ina one day conference at an adjacent hotel, it was assumed that this restaurant would be able to accommodate those who desired to eat at this location with more than likely large groups (5 or more). A a party of 7 in a restaurant that appeared to be 30% at capacity, we waited almost 30 minutes before we asked a server if we could just take an empty table. I was notified by one of the servers that they were without a hostess. They also appeared to be understaffed, which both attributed to the unnecessary wait time. When we did sit, our server made her best attempt to try to take care of our table, which is why we stayed and ate. This location needs more staff present to accommodate the patrons.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-arlington-14,2.28,2.46,2.46,,2.388

100,Ricki F.,"Hiram, GA",2,24,25.0,1.0,2016-07-26,"This was my worst dining experience EVER! I thought going to a Chili's would be a safe choice but I was wrong. Our server was unpleasant and everything came out on a delay. If that was the worse of it all would've been well. The appetizer came out without plates. We waited a while for them while our food got cold then when we got them, the plates weren't clean. I got my wine and it had fingerprints all over the glass and food residue was next to the rim left over from someone else's lips! Then the food came and the rim of every plate was atrocious with dirty smudges and water marks. I was so grossed out. The manager claimed she will have a meeting with her employees about cleaning the dishes. This is unacceptable. I will NEVER go to this location again and from the reviews I see they should be shut down. Disgusting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-arlington-14,2.04,2.4,2.4,,2.2560000000000002
