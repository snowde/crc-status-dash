15,Deke M.,"Tampa, FL",39,1169,1194.0,1.0,2012-04-01,"We must've gotten the same waitresses as the other reviewer.  Very poor service.  Beginning with the male hostess who was overwhelmed and not managing the greeting area well.  He looked for ""back-ups"" which he didn't get.  Only 5 pm and the restaurant side was virtually empty.  Three-four waitresses stood near the kitchen alcove doing nothing, even though tables needed to be cleared. We asked for bar booth seating (where chips & salsa are free--you pay for them on the restaurant side).  While we're waiting to be seated by him, a couple strolls past the hostess and takes the available booth!  He does nothing.  A second booth becomes available but is piled high with dirty dishes.  No waitress cleans it.  The hostess attempts to start.  A second group of customers swishes by us and attempts to take it.  We have to stand squished in between the bar and the booth for over five minutes before a waitress cleans it.  Then three come out.  They don't bother to clean the wet seat, we do it ourselves.  Finally seated, many waitresses standing around. Long time to get our drink order.  Service continues like this throughout the meal so will proceed to food review. Delicious!  The chips are thin, dry and crunchy and go great with the bitey salsa. The $5 Queso sauce is gritty and salty, not as good as we remembered.  Old Timer burger is one of the finest anywhere (too bad the ketchup on the table was out and it took forever to get a second).  Jalapeno bacon burger got rave reviews.  Mushroom swiss burger with blue cheese added got rave reviews. Chicken alfredo got rave reviews tho' way too much food.  French fries were yummy (minus ketchup).  Food took a longer time to arrive than usual.  The din in the bar was horrific between the shouters and music (which was so loud you couldn't hear it if you know what I mean).   Waitress didn't know what to do when we did NOT want the free second beer that comes with happy hour.  Diet Coke appeared watered down or flat.  Not enough napkins but we got up and grabbed from the bar as needed.  Avoided dessert and one more wait.  Their loss.  $55 plus tip to feed four of us is pretty decent but it reflected an $8 overcharge.  We just paid it.

Ok there are only so many tables, you can only have so many orders, so you can't really get unexpectedly busy, but even so if I have to wait i would rather sit at a table with drinks and chips versus outside for 20 minutes.

We were ready to take our business  elsewhere when server Vickie asked how she could help and said she would be happy to serve our group in a manner that we found most convenient. We agreed to stay with the understanding that we would not encounter the uncooperative server again. Vickie, Torme and a couple of other ladies did a wonderful job and were friendly. When we voiced our concerns with the manager he made the standard apology but defended the rude server saying she reacted that way because there was only one server on duty. Not sure where all the others came from suddenly? He also suggested in the future we call ahead when bringing a large group. I can see how that would help a day or even a few hours in advance, but that just isn't practical when participating in a youth sporting tournament. This manager and the rude server didn't seem to appreciate the fact that we just provided a much better revenue day and generous tips. Will avoid going there in the future.

It's close, convenient, and the service is pretty good. We usually go in with s large group but this time it was just me and my mother, hungry after a day at a local event. We sat at a booth in the bar area. Like Applebee's, they also have the table kiosks BUT you can only reorder drinks or order dessert from it. Games can also be played on them for a fee. You can pay from this device and it will print out a receipt too. We didn't use it this time.  We wanted the tableside guacamole where they mix the guacamole in front of you but our waitress said they were out so we got the regular order of guac. The chips that came with the chips and salsa were weak. The chips were thin so they broke when scooping and some were greasy. The salsa was very watery. The guac was just ok.  I ordered a simple Grilled Chicken Salad which was perfect and my mother got a Southwestern Trio consisting of a chicken quesadilla, chicken soft taco, and chicken enchilada. She said the enchilada was good but the soft taco was a disappointment. It just didn't have enough cheese for her. The quesadilla had shredded chicken and she wasn't a fan of that.

I told her a place to sit and she replied ""well go in the bar... you can seat yourself ya know"" Should have walked out right then!!! I told her the tables were dirty and she said well they'll clean them soon... then she walked away!!!!  Amber was pleasant and patient as we figured out what we wanted. She even made some nice suggestions. Our drinks stayed full the whole time we were there (which is HUGE in my book as I'm also a server) when we got our food she was very attentive to our needs.  The side of asparagus was flavorless and looked old...  But the fajitas were pretty good. I always order fajitas at chili's.  We didn't complain about the asparagus or anything while we were there... I chalk that disaster up to some food is just always better than others.

37,William C.,"Texarkana, AR",9,23,9.0,2.0,2016-04-30,Been a Loyal Chili's customer since the chains inception. Every site is totally different when it comes to quality of service. I would rate the CG Winter Haven store far superior than this Auburndale store. Managers at Adale store seem to not give a crap...period.

4,Ava H.,"Auburndale, FL",0,1,,1.0,2016-05-08,"My Mother's Day dinner with my daughter and my niece and my son-in-law was absolutely horrible as my food was undercooked the servers never came the drinks were never refilled and the place was filthy to the point to where I wanted to up and leave but I was so overwhelmed with Hunger I took one bite of the food and then felt sick right after. the servers sat around doing nothing conversating and the manager himself was barely doing anything sitting around looking at the dirty tables that weren't cleaned or dealt with. I also need to point out the fact that there were people served before me with piping hot food& on my table was served with cold undercooked food my Mother's Day dinner has been horribly ruined and I will never be eating at that establishment ever again. I was not asked how I would like my burger cooked. Had to ask for clean forks and knives repetitively. I do not know who does the hiring for this particular chilis, but in my opinion in the restaurant service for over 18 years they need to be fired.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-auburndale?start=20,1.72,1.72,1.72,,1.7200000000000002

Let me paint this picture. We have a large 16 party table on an early Sunday afternoon. Everyone's is hungry and the adults are ready for the 2-for-1 frozen margarita special. However, we were told they ""ran out"" of frozen marg...what??!! That's when our suspicions were proven right, they're not truly frozen - must be pre-made mixers...not cool. We ordered margs on the rocks which were more rocks than margs. We then ordered another round and asked for less ice...guess what, we got less ice and the same amount of marg (pic included) Waitress told us the bartender is stingy... When our orders came, most seemed like we ordered from the kids menu. First and last...hope this helps.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-auburndale,1.8,1.8,1.8,,1.8000000000000003

He is an arrogant, pompous, ridiculous man with a ferocious power trip and no sense of etiquette whatsoever. I won't return until this man is relieved of his burden of ownership. Awful. He tore down another customer and did not care who was listening and watching. My husband and I were made very uncomfortable. Patrons beware, you may get dinner and a show you weren't expecting.

45,Alyssa P.,"Auburndale, FL",32,1,,1.0,2017-02-12,"I wish I could give this place 0 stars! Probably the worst restaurant in Auburndale. Last few times I've ate there the food was cold, service was slow and no matter where you sit it's freezing. The very last time I went a huge roach crawled across our table and onto one of our plates of food. I had to kill the roach with a napkin and our waitress brushed it off & said ""sorry bout that. I'll bring the manager over"". The manager comes over &  first thing she says is ""so how are we doing?"" ??? How do you think I'm doing??? She acted like it was an everyday thing!! She asked what if we wanted something else, I told her ""I'm just ready to leave"" & she let us go without paying. Over the last 6 months the place has went down hill & is just disgusting.

41,James R.,"Auburndale, FL",0,12,5.0,1.0,2017-07-26,"Unbelievably bad from the beginning. After just over 5 minutes of waiting before we saw someone emerge on the floor, we were seated.  After we were seated another 12 minutes passed before we seen a waitress.  We told her we were ready to order and showed an email I had gotten earlier in the day from Chili's. She said that's the first she saw that one. Over 5 minutes later she came back and asked to see my email on my phone again. She walked away with it saying while she's walking, ""I'm showing this to my manager.""  After a couple of minutes she returned because I was getting a phone call. That's a BIG no-no taking someone's phone with my information on it. Then finally the manager shows up to tell us they won't honor it. We complained about the 30 minutes of events leading up to this and he smarted off and tried to side step the taking of my phone issue.  Rather than any real explanation he simple decided to embarrass us with tables full surrounding us, and said they weren't honoring it.  I guess I should have read the reviews before going.  One star is an above average rating. The last time I was at this location I had to sit through fowl language discussions coming from the kitchen.

They acted as though we were inconveniencing them to come eat there when it's a restaurant. The food was overcooked to the point I didn't eat mine and my husband ate about half of his.
