27,Kathleen M.,"Atlanta, GA",2363,1627,1470.0,2.0,2012-02-08,"I know a Chili's is a Chili's, but this isn't even a good one.  Their constantly redesigned menus seem to become more jarring to the eye each time around and increasingly difficult to read. I tried to focus on the ""lighter fare"" section, which meant under 750 calories. I don't know about you, but that seems like a pretty high limit: made me wary of what the caloric content was of other items on the menu. I went with the grilled chicken salad which was a hearty meh: the chicken itself was fine, but the lettuce was heavy on the iceberg and they just put plain Kraft shredded cheddar on top with some haphazard canned black beans. I can't cook and I'm pretty sure I could make something better at home.  Our server was nice enough but totally scatterbrained and seemed quite terrified of us. Food was a little slow to come out especially given how empty the place was. So yeah, it's a Chili's... and one I'd avoid at that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-augusta-2?start=20,2.6000000000000005,2.6000000000000005,2.6000000000000005,2.6000000000000005,2.6000000000000005

25,Monica K.,"Grovetown, GA",3,17,,2.0,2013-06-24,"Decent food at a decent price, but our waiter decided to take a break in the middle of our service so he went MIA for about 20 minutes after we received our food. The food was OK but the menu is horribly laid out. I know this isn't fine dining by any means but a menu that is less than 10 pages, would be a great start. It doesn't help that half the pages are full of pictures...Just stick with a simple menu, everyone knows the food isn't going to look anything like the pictures, so why bother? My husband and I only dined here because we received a free flatbread. My husband ordered a burger which was cooked pretty good but 5 Guys is better.  We probably won't be back but at least the flatbread was good.

I made my mom go back, she hated it previously, but even she's impressed by the improvements they've made.

Maybe I should have ordered that last night.  (According to the menu it's been updated and it looked delicious)  In my absence from dining at Chili's the menu has changed. I was overwhelmed by the choices!  That's not necessarily a bad thing.  Here's the bad- the restaurant wasn't really busy, but the service was seriously lacking.  The table was right by the hostess stand and door despite there being plenty of other places- lots of foot traffic going past, plus a draft from the door.   I had the crispy chicken tacos that come with rice and beans. The rice and beans were good, the tacos were a total disappointment. The taco was cold, and basically had a chicken nugget in the middle of it. The cheese had not even melted on the taco. The chicken was a lot of breading and not much meat.

We got the $20 dinner for 2 and he ordered half rack of ribs, I ordered their chicken cajun pasta, and a free skillet chocolate chip cookie for my birthday. We also had free chips and salsa, I'm not sure if they're unlimited but that's what we were offered. My husband would have liked his ribs to be in sauce instead of dry rubbed because well, it was too dry for his liking. My pasta was great, the pasta noodles could've been cooked better but overall okay. I devoured the cookie skillet! It was decadent and I'd definitely get it again. Service was great, he was a little too attentive to the point it was kind of awkward to enjoy our meal but he made sure he was on top of our needs!

Food was decent; I ordered the full rack of Dr Pepper ribs, and I was sufficiently satisfied. We also got the chips with salsa and guac. Those were good too. The problem is that all our plates were overpriced in my opinion. $17.99 for a rack of ribs and like $10 for the chips. Ridiculous. Our waiter provided good service, but he brown-nosed a little too hard by asking us if everything is ok every 5 minutes. After tip, the meal came out to a little over $65 for a group of 4.

Well folks I can't really form a complete opinion on the food after only one time but I can tell you to order the house or chef salad instead of lemon dressing one. I just don't consider lettuce leaves with salad dressing and a teaspoon of cheese a SALAD. South west soup was good and chips were excellent. SERVICE what little there was needs to improve pronto. We waited for silverware we waited for refills we had to ask for the chips ( they were supposed to come with three of our orders ) we never got second offer of soup.
