43,Natalie B.,"Round Rock, TX",8,26,,2.0,2012-01-17,"The thing I like about Chili's is that I know what to expect. Sure, sometimes you want a culinary adventure, but other times you just want to stop in, eat something that tastes good, and get on with your day. Normally, Chili's fulfills all those requirements fairly well, but not today!  We went at lunch time, and the waiting area near the entrance was packed. We were told that there would be a 5-10 minute wait, so my husband stayed to listen for our name while I went to use the restroom. On the way to the restroom, I noticed that there were plenty of empty, clean tables--but no one was being seated at them! The hostess kept disappearing to the kitchen, to the bar, to bus tables--she was everywhere except the hostess station. In our first 10 minutes of waiting, not one party was seated. After 20 minutes, three parties were seated that had come in after my husband and I, while we were still waiting. My husband asked the hostess why those people had been seated before us when we had been waiting longer, and she said, ""Oh, because I scratched your name off the list."" She never called our name, just decided to arbitrarily scratch it off the list. She apologized for the wait, but didn't apologize for her mistake. Finally, we were seated. The food was fine, but our server seemed very rushed. When my husband asked for lime for his water, the server went to the drink station, cut up a lime, and delivered it back to my husband in his bare hand. We're not germophobes, so that didn't particularly bother us, but it was kind of strange. I'll still go to Chili's. Heck, I'll probably still go to this Chili's. But this was definitely not a great Chili's experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-austin-20?start=40,2.6000000000000005,2.6000000000000005,2.6000000000000005,2.6000000000000005,2.6000000000000005

So many others in town are bashers and hate on me and my drag crew when we go in to eat before a show. It's the Liza's (my troupe) routine to get all gussied up and then go to Chili's for southwestern eggrolls. SO TASTY. AM I RITE? NE WAYZ, sometimes the managers are real jerks. One homophobe even refused to give us more ranch dipping sauce! But the manager here was so sweet (and cute :) )and even asked for my number after the meal. WILL BE BACK VERY SOON.

Mediocre?  My friend had buffalo wings, chips and salsa, and shared some string onions. The fried jalapenos were the best thing on the table. Salsa was jar-ish. Chips cold. My sandwich was edible. Kinda dry, grilled chicken. My fries were dead. Stone cold, laid in the window too long, dead. Hard, cold sticks o' greasy potato.  Didn't eat. The service was outstanding, though. The girl who waited on us had a great attitude and kept our tea topped off. Hope my date tipped her well. She should get a gig in a fancy place.

45,AJ E.,"Austin, TX",0,15,,1.0,2012-08-14,"So, I gave this place a pretty good review a few months ago.  I'm disappointed to retract it now.  A couple of days ago (August 8, 2012 if I recall correctly), I was here with my family for the nth time.  We frequent(ed) this place and pretty much walk in and out of here without remark... until now. As usual, I order a half-portion of their Texas Cheese Fries for an appetizer.  Something unusual came with it this time, though.  As I was chewing a mouthful of gooey, cheesy fries topped with a jalapeno and some bacon bits, I noticed something was hesitant be shredded to bits by my teeth.  And believe me, I was trying.  For a moment, I considered giving up and just swallowing.  I didn't think much of it.  Until I kept chewing... I put my fingers in my mouth and reach for this un-chewable, hard thing.  To my extreme disgust, I pulled out a GIANT fingernail.  This thing could have been a toenail.  Anyway, how do I know it wasn't mine?  Because I don't grow my fingernails out half an inch.  It was also coated in cheese.  I had to wipe off the cheese to make sure it was what I thought it was.  I took a picture of this fingernail, right next to the mouthful of Texas Cheese Fries I spit out with it.  I wish I could share it here to validate my story. By the time the waiter came back with our food, I politely told him to take the food back and let us pay for the drinks we ordered so that we can leave.  He fetched the manager; an Asian lady I've seen many times before (although she does not know/recognize me).  Even she was shocked.  She was profusely polite (and not just then - she always has been quite courteous).  She asked if there was anything she could do.  Nope.  I just wanted to walk out of there.  She declined my offer to pay for drinks (not even the margarita was a good-enough chaser) and gave us her sincere apology. Now, I've been here countless times before without incident.  I really liked this place.  However, after this, in good conscience I cannot recommend that anyone eat here until whatever sanitation issue in the kitchen is resolved.  A fingernail, folks.  Not a little clipping either.  And I THOUGHT TO SWALLOW IT.  I was under the assumption that those in food service had to keep their nails clipped...  I just gagged again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-austin-20?start=40,2.372,2.372,2.372,2.372,2.372

42,Emma N.,"Cedar Park, TX",1,29,3.0,2.0,2013-01-05,"Me and my BF got carry out today. At 3pm ( not exactly a busy time in the restaurant ) we waited about 5 minutes just to be helped at the ""to go"" counter. Other workers in the building did not even acknowledge us. Ok, so far not great but not the end of the world either.  The guy who came over to help us was polite to us. He was courteous and helpful. That is the only reason they get two stars instead of one.   The food was ready when we got there which was about 15 minutes after we called. I got the Chicken fajitas and the bf got some three piece app for his meal. He picked two kinds of chicken and some little hamburger thingys.  His food was ok. not spectacular and not uneatable. Just ok. Mine, MEH, I've had better food made by my 3 year old niece. Upon opening the box to be sure everything was there I noticed they had only given me tort's, a small small portion of chicken, tons and tons of onions and a few strips of green peppers. No Cheese, no lettuce, blah....once he returned with some lettuce, some sour cream (both a good sized portion) and some cheese, I noticed that the cheese was in one of those 2oz to go cups, and was only 1/3 of the way full. UGH! the best part is the cheese! I asked him to get me some more which he quickly did.  We got home and I have to say the veggies (massive amounts of onions and small amount of green peppers) where either over or under cooked. The only reasoning I can come up with for this is that they over cooked the veggies threw a ton of onions in under cooked those and then threw them all in my container to take home. PFFT!~ Thanks for charging me the same price as you would in the restaurant but not even close to the same quality chili's In the end I will never go to this location for take out again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-austin-20?start=40,2.472,2.472,2.472,2.472,2.472

Suggestions: - Hostess should be there to greet and seat customers - not clean tables. - Waiters should know what section they are working before customers arrive.   - Discussions on who is working where should take place off the floor and not in front of customers. - Appetizers should arrive before the meal, especially when requested as such. - Plates should be dried off before being given to customers. - Food should be served fresh and hot. - Wait staff should do what they say they are going to do.  (ie. be right back...)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-austin-20,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92

I wanted to order the Awesome Blossom, but I've learned that calorie abyss is long gone. I'm not a a huge fan of big chain restaurants but not against eating at them once in a while. There was a lot to like here. The ambiance is decent. Inoffensive pop songs play at an ignorable volume while people can face each other and still watch two different TVs that are playing the same show, which is inaudible with closed captioning enabled. Our server, Melissa, was very pleasant, professional and attentive. It wasn't a busy night, but we didn't have to wait long for her if we needed something. The receipts have a handy ""Gratuity Guide"" that shows potential tip values at 15% and 18% if you're living in 1995 inflation rates/are a cheap asshole and 20% and 22% if you're a decent human being that understands and appreciates the rarity and the value of quality service from those who have very little incentive to provide it. Either you tip well in these instances or do everyone a favor and eat your beans at home straight out of the can, you cheap trash. The food was alright. I've had better strawberry lemonade, but it was pretty tasty. My friend ordered a steak, which was fine after salting. I ordered the chicken Cajun pasta. She seemed to enjoy hers, but mine was only okay. The meat was great, but the presentation was a bit lacking. The meat was sliced but still mostly in one piece and not really mixed together with the pasta. Not that big of a deal cutting it up and mixing it myself, but I feel like there wasn't nearly enough sauce. There was just enough to partially coat the penne, but I prefer my pasta to be swimming in rich, flavorful sauce. There are these little tablet game screens on every table that cost $2 if you have children that need to channel their annoying into. I guess it's more cost effective and lower maintenance than the restaurant arcades of yore, but really, if your kid needs these things, maybe not bring them. And people who bring babies who can't even eat there, why can't you just go to McDonald's if you can't afford a babysitter? Whyyyyyyyyyy? I visited the bathroom. Their toilet seems commercial grade, but the flow of the flush (or FOTF) was oddly weak. I pushed the handle a few times just to get a good spin going. It was like watching an hourglass with water instead of sand. There might be issues with this if you leave something sizable behind. The worst thing was a small issue. When we were seated, our table and seats were still damp from being wiped down. I sat on it, didn't feel it through my pants. Okay, it's just water or cleaning solution or whatever. No stains on my butt. But why couldn't someone use a towel or something? Overall, good, not great, but a convenient walk if you're staying at the Econolodge nearby and enough distractions to keep your unruly children complacent enough for you to forget about your joyless marriage, if only for an hour or so.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-austin-20,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005

9,Slow P.,"Austin, TX",0,1,,3.0,2016-06-22,Food was good. Had to wait a while for the food after ordering and was not that busy. Been a while since last visit .. and would order a frozen coronarita. Ordered one again and this time was not impressed with the drink. Drink was more liquid than frozen and foamy on top. My expectations were a little let down on this visit.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-austin-20,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92
14,Sarah L.,"Austin, TX",0,9,,1.0,2016-07-21,"Though I usually really like Chili's, this one is not great. It took an unacceptable amount of time to get our food even though we were the only customers there besides one other small family. Our waiter was either very new or needed to be re-trained. When we finally got our food, it was terrible! I had pasta and the noodles were rock hard, like they had barely even been cooked. My mom asked for salsa and had to ask for it again and then never received it. Our silverware was also filthy and we asked for replacements when we sat down- took 15 minutes just to get new silverware!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-austin-20,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84
5,Greg M.,"Round Rock, TX",0,15,,1.0,2016-10-28,"We had dinner October 27,2016 We had the 2 for $20 We both had the Fajita's and Carnitas  and before we even left the restaurant my cousin was in the restroom. I dropped her off at her home and had to rush myself to the restroom and it didn't stop til 10 am this morning. My cousin called me and told me she spoke to a Manager named Kim and kim said she would comp our meal for today. I was not in the mood to go back and try their food again. Well my cousin convinced me and we returned we even asked for Kim and she never came out... They did give us another free meal and dessert  which was nice... I had the chicken salad and did not finish the salad but did eat the chocolate dessert. One of the employees came out and stated she didnt know what the conversation with Kim  who never came out. They charged us for the Tea.  I couldn't careless if you charged me for the Tea but it would have been nice to speak to the Manager and talk about the ill food which has kept me in the restroom most of the evening and through out the night. I will not be returning the service was horrible and the food went through us.....  Thanks Kim for stopping by and talking with us about our meal and service.... Oh never mind she didnt.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-austin-20,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8

0,Jennie N.,"Houston, TX",85,6,18.0,4.0,2017-07-15,"I came here with a party of four and had to wait maybe 5 minutes until we were acknowledged by the host who was also running the to-go counter at the time. This was during lunch time so the wait was expected and understandable. Once attended to, we were quickly seated and taken care of accordingly!  We each ordered a lunch combo and the waiter remembered our order without taking any notes or anything which was pretty impressive! It took a little longer than usual for the soup to be served, but again, the restaurant was in a pretty busy lunch rush. Everything was hot and tasted great. The portion of fries were smaller than what's normally given at other locations I've visited, but other than that, everything was great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-austin-20,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84
