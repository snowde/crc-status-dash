Whenever I go to Chili's it reminds me of the Austin Power's movie with the Fat Bastard singing the Chili's theme song and trying to eat Mini Me :) I go here once a while for lunch as their new lunch menu is quick and good (soup and sandwich combo). We went for dinner last night and it was a little disappointing. The table they seated us was really dirty but in the plus side the waiter was really nice. We got the grilled lime and garlic shrimp and the baby back ribs. The food was ok and good have been better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-austin-6,,,,,
