4,Maiqui P.,"Manila, Philippines",25,249,264.0,5.0,2015-06-04,"I have been a fan of Chili's for over a decade now. Chili's is where i discovered my love for Mexican food. Over the years it has changed a lot of dishes and recipes but i always enjoy what they offer. Their portions are huge which makes it worth the price. I also enjoy their drinks, i have fond memories of my grandmother letting me try her margarita! But going back to the food, anything you order is delicious! I dont usually order salad but i make sure i do when i am at Chili's. The bottomless nachos are a trap - they never end. Be careful with those because if you get full eating all the nachos, you may not have space left for their other dishes which are mouth-watering and always make you feel good afterwards. I really look for the flavor of Chili's and i won't mind making the trip! Who cares if i have to drive and look for parking just to get a taste of my favorite Tex-Mex restaurant in the entire world! I know I can rely on Chili's because its taste is consistent no matter what continent i am in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bar-and-grill-mandaluyong,,,,,

Although they are a bit expensive, I still think with Chili's quality of food, it's all worth it.  I personally like their Fish and Chips. It's pretty hard to impress me when it comes to this dish but theirs is one I would recommend to anyone! The fish is perfectly seasoned and the batter it's coated with is equally satisfying! The tartare sauce that comes with it also help the fish shine.  Chili's is also known to have the best frozen strawberry mojito and I must agree! It's super good, I could actually have three to four glasses of this drink in one sitting. Their regular mojito isn't bad at all either but as a big strawberry fan, I'd always prefer the pink perfect concoction.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bar-and-grill-mandaluyong,,,,,
2,Kristely B.,"Quezon City, Philippines",20,54,156.0,3.0,2016-06-19,"Had dinner here with friends. So we didn't know what to order. But we had the Santa Fe quesadillas and it's awesomeeeeeee! We had the trio appetizer (buffalo wings, egg roll, and something else that I can't remember) We also had the Fajitas (shrimp and beef). I thought it was just good. I'd say the service was friendly. They suggested stuff for us. They were quick and attentive. The food was good enough for a Mexican restaurant - lots of salsa and stuff like that. I'm not really familiar with Mexican cuisine so they all kinda taste the same for me. (Sorry for the amateur review). I think it was pricey (oh especially the desserts, you'd pay like $7++ for a brownie with a vanilla ice cream on top?). Yeah I can make that myself with only $2. So we didn't really order desserts. Other than the overpriced menu, I think it's an average Mexican place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bar-and-grill-mandaluyong,,,,,
1,Joey R.,"Pasig, Philippines",880,441,3289.0,4.0,2016-07-09,"Honestly, when Carlo finds out that there is a promo at Chili's, we will most definitely be there! He loves this place. Seriously. Hahaha! We always end up ordering the Burger Bites and Unlimited Chips + Dip. I know it is a BIG chain but they serve really good American food and the service is amazing! One time a kid threw his toy plane into my drink (I did not do anything bad to the kid after, I promise). It wasn't the management's fault but they gave me a new drink and didn't charge me. :) Personally, since the food is quite heavy, I go for the Crispy Chicken Tenders and/or the Crispy Chicken Salad. When I am really hungry I order the Southern Smokehouse Burger or the Country Fried Steak. Big burger with bacon strips and onion rings or a deep fried steak? Bring on the meat! When I'm here, I prefer to just drink my Liter Mug of Beer or Strawberry Margarita on the rocks. Very chill and cozy place to be with friends and family. Always a favorite!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bar-and-grill-mandaluyong,,,,,
3,Pasquale S.,"Vanl√∏se, Copenhagen, Denmark",12,16,,4.0,2016-08-07,"Great ribs! They are not very cheap, however it's worth a visit and dishes are big. My favourite is the sweet chipotle version",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bar-and-grill-mandaluyong,,,,,
