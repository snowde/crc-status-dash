1,Bettina B.,"Quezon City, Philippines",89,18,81,4.0,2017-05-13,"When it comes to delicious all-American grub, Chili's has always been one of my family's top picks. Just recently, Chili's launched some new dishes, including what they call ""Art of the Burger,"" where their chefs created fresh new flavor combinations! Aside from that, they also have new sides and shakes for those in search for the unique. Here's a look at what to expect on your next visit: Crispy Corn Masa Fries (P300) It's their tasty house-made fusion of potatoes and toasted corn seasoned with chimichurri sauce, parmesan blend, cilantro, and lemon-char seasoning salt, served with three dips (jalapeño aioli, chipotle aioli, and ketchup) A similar dish is their Chicken-loaded Crispy Corn Masa Fries (P525) which makes use of the same tasty house-made fusion of potatoes and toasted corn, but topped with smoked and grilled chicken mix, queso blanco, queso crumbles, green chile sauce, and cilantro. Both items are good to share (and actually pretty heavy), so I suggest getting only one order per group of maybe four to five people to leave enough room for the main dish. These were pretty addicting - everyone couldn't seem to stop eating them since the fries really have good flavor combinations to them. For the dips, my favorite is the chipotle aioli (plus anything with cheese is okay in my book.) For the burgers, we started off with the bites. The Bacon Perfection Bites (P650) is Chili's house-made blend of premium ground beef and bacon, topped with pickles, cheese, and more bacon (who doesn't like bacon!?) It is then drizzled with jalapeño aioli on a buttered toasted bites bun and served with garlic parmesan fries. If you want something healthier, compared to bacon, at least, here is their Shrimp Masterpieces (P550) - succulent house-made shrimp patty on pickled onion coleslaw, pico de gallo, chipotle aioli, and Southwest Cajun seasoning. Of course, the burger is smothered in queso fundido on the same buttered toasted bites bun. Also served with garlic parmesan fries. These burgers are the perfect size to share. But if you want to go big, then perhaps the Magnificent Beef & Shrimp Burger (P650) is the one for you. Thanks to Chili's, we now have the perfect marriage of a hamburger patty and shrimp patty with, of course, queso fundido. The entire thing is placed on pickled onion coleslaw, pico de gallo, and chipotle aioli, topped with avocado slices.  Avocado seem to be all the rage nowadays, so it's nice that they found a way to incorporate it into their newest burger. Work of art indeed! Last but not the least is their Sunrise Burger (P550), a carefully constructed breakfast burger with leaf lettuce, tomato, onions, and their signature sauce, topped with queso fundido, bacon, and fried egg. Since burgers and fries go best with shakes, they also came up with two new offerings! The Molten Shake is all about the chocolate, while the Coffee Toffee is, well, all about the coffee (and toffee). For P220, it is a pretty sweet deal, if you ask me. ;) Don't skip on dessert since their Salted Caramel Molten Lava Cake (P420) will change your life! It's everything your salted caramel loving heart desires and more!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bar-and-grill-quezon-city,,,,,

Chili's Philippines recently launched the 'Art of The Burger"" featuring four new distinct creations that boast the use of fresh ingredients to create new flavour combinations.  As would be expected from a meat-obsessed concept, Chili's puts a heavy emphasis on the patty. The new Magnificent Burger uses a hamburger beef patty and shrimp patty with Queso Fundido and it comes on a buttered toasted potato bun with pickled onion coleslaw, pico de gallo, avocado slices, and chipotle aioli sauce. The shrimp patty adds a subtle sweetness, while the pico de gallo brings it all alive. The Sunrise Burger is your typical all-American-style patty, but with a little more heft. A fried egg on top adds extra flavor, as well as the crispy bacon adding just the right amount of saltiness. Some may find it exceedingly rich, especially with the egg, bacon, and queso fundido but the grilled red onions are there to cut through things.  The Shrimp Masterpieces and Bacon Perfection Bites are indulgent, addictive addition to the Art of The Burger menu. These little fellas are not just for people with small hands who can't commit to a full burger. Even people with huge hands and sausage fingers happily devour them nonetheless. These new burger creations are charmingly served with a side of Garlic-Parmesan Fries. And speaking of Fries, Chili's also created the Crispy Corn Masa Fries, an excellent starter and a nice deviation from the usual french fries. For the full experience, get the Chicken Loaded Crispy Corn Masa Fries that comes with three sauces--Ketchup, Chipotle Aioli, and Jalapeno Aioli. And after you're finished with the burgers and fries, peruse the menu once more and do try the new Salted Caramel Molten and the Milkshakes. Pro Tip: Get the Coffee Toffee Shake. There is usually a wait but please, just wait it out. Your body and soul will thank you. It's hard to expect anything less from Chili's, honestly. The new Art of the Burger menu is proof that the almighty above loves us and want us to be full at all times. Seriously though, I'm not going to go too deep on this other than to say that the Magnificent Burger is one of the great burgers I've had in Manila.  The experience of eating these new flavour creations for the first time is hard to put into words, but it's essentially a party in my mouth. They complement each other in making Chili's an excellent place for unapologetically delicious comfort dishes.  I recommend you try them soon before they're gone!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bar-and-grill-quezon-city,,,,,
