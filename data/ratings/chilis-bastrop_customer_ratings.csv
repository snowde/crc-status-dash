Rather than drive him all the way to Austin, i decided to give this one another chance. There must be new management, because the service and food was as I expect Chili's to be. The downside was too many screaming, running, snot-nosed brats and a men's restroom that looked like something out of a NYC tenement.

I saw a lot of hands on the food. It seemed mostly from the last person who finishes up the plate after it has left the cooks. They poor the brocoli out of a bag and then push it with their fingers so it looks nice. They touched the bread, fries and more. Wear some gloves please! Wait staff - do not touch the food.

Says that the cost of the free item is more expensive than the entrée so they won't accept it. There is nothing on that coupon that says a lunch entrée cannot be purchased. It has other specifics like you cannot order an appetizer as your meal, but nothing about the lunch combo. Other waiters have let us use it. I wouldn't mind if the rules on the coupon stated cannot be used at lunch or with lunch portions but she just pulls that stipulation out of nowhere so it angers me.

The portions were massive, though, but not tasty enough to take home.   I got home and my stomach asked, ""What did you do to me? Why must you punish me?"" Holy Chorro-izo!

I mean, pasta is yummy. Chili's is yummy. It seemed like a win/win. No/no. Neither was a win. The service wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either. The waiter just seemed a little distracted. Maybe he had a hot date later and was distracted? Maybe he just didn't really give af? It's ok, I didn't really give af about the tip either, so it evened out. The food was lackluster. I get it, it's a Chili's, not a fine dining establishment, but we were sitting RIGHT BY the kitchen and our food was lukewarm. Did he take a detour? Maybe he was canoodling with his hot date; she or he had to be hotter than the food. I got the pasta and it was okay. I did not eat it all, and I was starving. I decided to carb up back at the hotel with some Fig Newtons. yes, i chose Fig Newtons over this mess of a pasta dish. It was the Chicken Alfredo one. The bread wasn't even that good. It was cold and dry. How do you mess up bread?!  I was just glad to get our dinner over with and get out of there.

Not because of the quality of the food, but the quality of the customer service. I have lived in Bastrop for two decades and have had to come to this establishment over the years due to family/work obligations and have consistently experienced rude hostesses and servers, but nothing has been so upsetting than a recent to go order my family placed. The order was placed over the phone, and when  my mother asked the employee to repeat the order he huffed and said he ""got it,"" but when he did repeat the order it was wrong. He was politely corrected. Later, when we went to pick up the order a woman from the kitchen shouted at us if we had been helped. When we said not yet, she found the man who had originally taken our order to finish the transaction. He then asked us ""which one of us ordered"" then proceeded to complain to my mother for asking him ""3 times"" if he had gotten the order right. Then he patronizingly showed my mother the display on the computer as proof while explaining to her that he had in fact gotten the order correct because in his mind, my mother was the one who has ordered incorrectly and he had done us a favor for correcting it. My mother and I both work in the service industry, and were appalled that someone representing service would act in such a condescending, immature, and rude manner towards a customer.
