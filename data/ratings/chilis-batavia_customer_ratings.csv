37,Kevin M.,"Geneva, IL",0,2,,1.0,2012-02-14,Unbelievable.  no organization at all.  Wait an hour and 15 minutes after being told 35 minutes and withno order to how they are seating.  Then we get a booth where they have to put a chair on the end.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-batavia?start=20,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000004
28,Margaux D.,"Aurora, IL",157,143,129.0,3.0,2012-02-19,"Another steakhouse chain. This location isn't any different than any other Chili's I've been to. They've changed their menu a lot recently and they have these new receivers on every table that allow you to pay your bill and order on them. However, they never work and somehow these electronic waiters just don't do it for me. The one thing I can say about this Chili's is that the staff is attentive. I've had service at other locations where I've had to wait a lot longer for service.  Another note: If you're going to order a drink, be sure to have two forms of ID. Apparently this is a new law in Batavia because kids were stealing their relatives' ID's and using them to buy drinks. I've only been double-carded here, though. Bring a college ID or something I guess.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-batavia?start=20,1.9000000000000001,1.9000000000000001,1.9000000000000001,1.9000000000000001,1.9000000000000004

29,Kevin R.,"Algonquin, IL",59,10,,1.0,2014-07-30,"Chili's has been thoroughly disappointing to me lately. First off, the water both my girlfriend and I received had a very weird taste to it and I couldn't even stomach it. (Normally, I can stomach most things) Secondly,  the server we had really didn't seem all to interested in our table. She never cleared a single item the entire time and even left the mango iced tea on our table that my girlfriend told her she didnt because it was too sweet. We had no room on the table. Finally, we both got the fajitas and the chicken was DEFINITELY not chicken.  It was rubbery and over processed....almost gelatinous.

We were sat right away; we missed the rush by minutes.  We ordered right away to not get caught up in the rush.  Forty minutes later we asked to speak to a manager and told her we were leaving in 5 minutes if our food didn't come out.  Of course it came out right away then but had clearly been sitting. We could see the kitchen from our seat and it was absolute chaos.  By this time our kids were beyond restless so we ate fast and tried to rush out. Of course, even though we had complained,  the manager hadn't made any adjustments to the bill.  Just a reminder to us to not go back.  After the adjustment I insisted on and tip (it wasn't the waiters fault! ) It still cost almost $40 for two kids and 2 adults with no apps, no dessert.

31,Kersten R.,"Batavia, IL",123,22,5.0,1.0,2014-10-30,"Executive Management/owners should take a deep look into their food quality and staff lately. We live closeby and chilis has always been a go to place...in fact I don't mind waiting.... as long as the food is hot and good and if it is busy...good service always a plus and will be reflected in tip.  Today (thurs) my son and I came at noon...every chain around was packed with lunch bunch....not this place...dead as a door nail....no receptionist....waited for 15 minutes as my son kept saying lets just go....wise little man...we should have. Waitress (ended up being ours) was unapologetic and rude. Waited another 15 for her to take our order....again no one there. She finally took our order never to be seen from again. My son ordered kids meal pizza which tasted metallic and I ordered beef enchiladas which are usually awesome....not this time...brown, sickly, avocado on old-tasting, lukewarm food. Manager came over and was abrupt and said 'well u aren't paying for the kids meal anyway so why should it matter?!'

23,Juli D.,"Elgin, IL",0,7,2.0,2.0,2015-02-05,"A review for a chain restaurant...don't you know what to expect from a place like Chili's? Yes. I expect decent food, decent service, leaving with the feeling that I overpaid a bit, but overall, satisfied.  I don't frequent these chain places but I know they are usually a safe bet.   We should have just eaten at the Sam's Club cafe and called it a night.  One of the stars is for those tablet things the kids can play with while we wait.  It was busier than I thought it would be on a Wednesday evening. Our food took forever to arrive.  My husband had the sirloin with grilled avocado.  He said it wad good.  The kids had chicken tenders and they were good.  One of my kids ordered the mashed potatoes from the kids' picture menu.  They arrived with cheese and bacon.  That kid hates cheese. The future lawyer in her pointed at the picture which showed plain mashed potatoes and said it lied.  I agreed,  but we didn't make a fuss.  She just ignored the potatoes.  I had the shrimp tacos. I love tacos. I love shrimp tacos. These were not good.  The shrimp was floppy and just had an awful texture.  I picked them out and just ate the slaw. Then one of my kids realized they never got their drinks.  When our server came around I told him the shrimp was gross and pointed to the pile on my plate. I mentioned that they never got the drinks,  but we didn't want them as we were done with our meal.  The server offered me another meal,  but I was Chili-ed out at this point.  He offered to talk to the manager,  and I agreed.   He said manager took half off my shrimp tacos ($5.50--wooo, but that's not even the point) but never came out to apologize.  That don't-give-a-shrimp attitude is what left a really bad taste in my mouth.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-batavia?start=20,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000004

6,Jen R.,"San Marcos, CA",51,237,12.0,4.0,2015-07-11,"There is absolutely nothing wrong with this Chili's. Which is weird because... well, it's Chili's. We're not huge fans of nationwide restaurant chains but my husband got a gift card to here and we were hungry.  The food was good! It didn't taste microwaved or overly salty. Husband got the smokehouse burger, which was delicious (he let me have JUST ONE bite). I opted for the unlimited soup and salad. The salad was not just iceberg, which made me very happy. They got that ranch dressing on fleek. The chili was good  (needed lots of hot sauce) and the chicken enchilada soup was about as good as the worst thing you could get at Taco Bell. I couldn't finish it. We probably won't go again for a while, if ever, just because... well, it's Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-batavia,,,,,

I ordered the margarita chex mex bowl and my husband ordered the original chicken crispers. I asked for no beans.....I got beans. The food tasted horrible, it was very greasy. Not even ten minutes after I left I was so sick to my stomach.  Prior to this experience I have not patronized a Chilis for months because I feel like the food choices are poor.  The service we always receive is poor and the good is never anything to remember. I do not recommend anyone to go to Chilis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-batavia,,,,,
27,Mark D.,"North Aurora, IL",0,6,4.0,1.0,2015-08-30,The worst service  i have had. The menu has changed and the food is terrible. My chicken was ice cold. Waitress never even checked on us.

18,F S.,"St. Charles, IL",0,9,,1.0,2015-10-24,"A horribly managed location this Chilis is! We have had very mediocre service here before but this takes the cake.  Me and the GF walk in and the teenage ""Hostess"" walks up and we decide to sit in the bar area in a booth the Hostess suggests.  Well we are sitting there for like 12 minutes and see no waitress in site.  Nobody at all has come up to us to say anything.  After a few more minutes a bored looking, not at all engaged blonde haired waitress walks by our table but she is doing her best to ignore us as she takes the bill from another table.  She just plods on by as we sit there.  Its been almost 15 minutes now without any service or acknowledgement.  Then a few more minutes go by and the waitress starts slowly picking up dishes from the table that just left the whole time not even a glance in our direction as we are looking at her. We are only maybe 15 feet away.  At this point we don't even want to be served if she ever came over, by this crumby excuse for a waitress so we get up and leave.  As we are leaving the Hostess sees us and I inform her we are leaving and will not be back as we sat there for almost 20 minutes without anybody even approaching our table.  The management is non existent here.  I guess Chilis is so profitable they can just let money walk right out the door.   To Chilis Corporate; this Chilis in Batavia IL. his hurting your brand...get a clue. We will not go to Chilis anymore and will share our experience beyond this review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-batavia,,,,,

24,Brian P.,"Batavia, IL",78,12,,1.0,2015-10-27,Waited almost 45 minutes for the server to tell us that our food got pushed back because a plate spilled (which happened before we ordered) and the kitchen had to make that one first. Being in the industry I know when a server lies and makes up an excuse when he forgets to put an order in. Don't lie to your table and avoid them. Communicate to them and let them know your human and totally forgot. I would be more forgiving but now I'm just passed.

Server was nice and friendly guy, joking around and accommodating. Pleasant to interact with.  2) Owner (or manager) who was also working in the kitchen, was also on hand to help out with placing orders in case server got busy. Impressive !  3) Portions were good ! Clean, prepared and presented well, looked appetizing.  4) Server was generous to point out that it was ""kids eat free"" day. So our kid got a kiddo meal ! Lots of points for that.  5) Will recommend this franchise above other Chilis' in the area to friends and associates.

Extremely poorly managed.  The kitchen very disorganized and while I was waiting for my food I saw a waitress come in with a plate and a number of staff were looking at something on the plate that obviously shouldn't have been there.  I'm not a lip reader but I thought I saw an ""oh no"" and ""oh shit"".  I did call to let the manager know about the food and was credited 50% and told ""the cook was a little overwhelmed etc"".  Really!?  My pocket book was overwhelmed I just paid for this junk.

We each got the chicken crispers although I went the crunchy route whereas my fiance stuck to the classic beer-battered chicken. He opted for 2 sides of fries which were crunchy but could've used more of that delicious seasoned salt. I got fries and onion rings but they were a little stingy on the fries. High demand, I guess. The avocado ranch was delicious! Our food wasn't super hot by the time we got home but that could've been the 15 minute car ride so I won't hold it against them.
