28,Jay M.,"Boston, MA",41,235,,4.0,2012-01-30,"Went on a busy Friday night - was very happy that we called ahead.  We were seated right when we got there.  Service was good and food was very good.  Had the chicken sandwich and fries - both came out very hot and very fresh (I get the same thing at every Chilli's I go to and sometimes it is hit or miss).  I would recommend this Chilli's, just a cautionary note to call ahead so you don't have to wait a long time to be seated (they allow it if there is a wait)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beavercreek?start=20,2.288,2.288,2.288,2.288,2.2880000000000003
27,Sarah F.,"Columbus, OH",125,512,202.0,1.0,2012-02-14,"Yuck. First, they sit the 6 of us at a table that really seems to be for 4. I took the window seat and I literally had to climb over the chair because there was no room to get in at all. The whole time I was uncomfortable and angry. Then, my sister orders something off their ""light"" menu, and it comes with a butter soaked bun and cheese covered broccoli. Not exactly low cal friendly. She asked for a different bun, and they only brought her another top! Just half!!! I couldn't believe it. The burger I got, veggie burger, was boring and not great, and my coke was flat. I used to love this location years ago, not sure what happened.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beavercreek?start=20,2.02,2.02,2.02,2.02,2.02
17,Tracie F.,"Redondo Beach, Los Angeles, CA",352,690,57.0,2.0,2012-07-15,"I have to say that I do love Chili's but sadly, not this location. Why you ask? I shall explain... We were seated by a very pleasant hostess who gave us menus that were in severe need of replacement. They were sticky and worn and just overall gross. I didn't even want to let my paws touch them. Yuck! Our waitress was very mediocre. She was not attentive at all. We asked her for a few minutes while we contemplated what we were going to order. Well she sure gave us a ""few"" minutes...like 10 of them. While that doesn't seem like an exorbitant amount of time, it is an eon when you are starving. Service didn't get much better than that. I got the all you can eat soup and salad. I was not asked if I wanted seconds until my salad plate and soup bowl had a long extended absence of food. When I did get my refill on soup I was unable to eat it all. I asked for a ""to go"" bowl and was denied. I was able to get the left-over chips to go however, taking the remaining bowl of soup was a big no-no. I can understand if I was asking for a new bowl to go home with. I could not understand why I could not wrap up the soup that I had already eaten. Apparently this is their policy, one I have never encountered before.  Overall, the whole lack of customer service really left a bad taste in my mouth. Will we be back? Maybe...if we get a hankering for chili's and we are in the area. I would however, ask for another waitress. This one just did not cut it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beavercreek,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152
25,Brian K.,"Pittsboro, NC",3,58,7.0,3.0,2012-09-25,This is a Chili's.  It is the same as every Chili's.  If you already like Chili's you'll be happy.  If you don't already like Chili's this one's a fine place to give it a try.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beavercreek?start=20,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998

22,Destiny J.,"San Antonio, TX",15,10,,2.0,2013-10-31,"I was already on edge about eating at this location. Upon entrance the menus were sitting on a serving tray with a hand written paper sign that said "" please wait to be seated"". Anyway I had the spicy shrimp tacos they were too spicy that I couldn't even enjoy them and I LOVE spicy food. Let's just say the only thing that was good were the margaritas. That same night my stomach cramped up so bad and I've been having a rumbling stomach and loose stool for 2 days since I ate there. I will never eat there again",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beavercreek?start=20,,,,,
14,Scott S.,"Dayton, OH",83,47,8.0,5.0,2014-03-01,"I'm not a big chain-restaurant guy... I love indy restaurants. However...  Chili's gets very high marks across the board from me. A wide variety on their menu, decent service and atmosphere. I've eaten at Chili's many times... LOVE the chili queso dip! I get it almost every time I eat there. But what prompted me to write a review was the spicy shrimp tacos! omgosh! So flavorful, and an interesting mix of flavors at that. Very fresh! The term ""flavor explosion"" may be overused in advertising, but it certainly applies in this case! Trust me, if you like that sort of dish, in lieu of a burger or something more overtly Tex-Mex, you won't be disappointed.  Count'em, THREE soft tacos stuffed with shrimp and all the trimmings, with a side of REAL beans and rice. (Not refried beans.) Let me know if you enjoyed them as much as I did!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beavercreek,,,,,
19,Phillip F.,"Dayton, OH",5,18,,3.0,2014-04-28,"Be careful when you order steak. When my friend ordered the classic ribeye, they don't tell you its a 6oz. You have to ask for the 10oz. Needless to say we had to wait for them to cook another one. Outside of that the food was good. Its not a wow experience. Our waitress was less then stellar. She needs better customer service training or something. The manager was pleasant and handled things very well. I've had better experiences but it isn't the worst.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beavercreek,,,,,
23,Sandy P.,"Springfield, OH",1136,105,688.0,1.0,2014-05-04,"I don't expect much from chain restaurants. However this was worse than expected.  I've never eaten at Chili's before so when we sat down I asked Leena, our server, what they were known for.  She said the southwestern egg rolls were the best and their food was the best.  She suggested the watermelon margarita so I ordered it.  It was not made according to the menu.  There was no sugar or salt on the rim; no lime and the watermelon puree was a few days too old.  It was really a poorly made drink.  She said either Rich or Keith made it but whoever it was needs bartender 101.  We got the trio appetizer with eggrolls, potato skins and artichoke dip.  The egg rolls were descent, the potato skins were still cold in the middle and the artichoke dip was good with plenty of nacho chips. The smokehouse burger did not come with 4 slices of bacon as the menu states. Maybe the cook thought three was enough.  It was cooked well done when ordered medium.  The fries had no seasoning on them.  It was mediocre at best.  The buffalo wings arrived plain; they needed a sauce or something to make them have some flavor.  They actually tasted as though they'd been made beforehand and then just reheated in a microwave. They were mushy not crisp.  I didn't order anything I was already so disappointed with the cocktail and appetizer there was no need to waste more money.  This location has no much competition that you'd think they'd work even harder to make their food stand out. Not the case here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beavercreek?start=20,,,,,
21,Andrew H.,"Dayton, OH",0,1,,1.0,2014-08-12,Terrible service won't eat here again everything was burnt had to have them take it back so it took another 25 minutes to get our food then they of course still want to charge you full price without even apologizing for wasting your time with their mediocre food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beavercreek?start=20,,,,,
29,Steve G.,"Yellow Springs, OH",0,16,,1.0,2014-10-06,Service was very slow. They brought out the wrong food and did not seem to care. It took very long to get the correct food which was not very good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beavercreek?start=20,,,,,
15,Kim S.,"Dayton, OH",1,20,38.0,2.0,2014-10-23,"I go to Chillies once or twice a year. Usually have a good experience. But not this last time.   My husband and I wanted to try their new burgers. I ordered mine with american cheese , lettuce , bacon, and mayo. The waitress offered chips and salsa which I thought was a free thing. Some resteraunts will offer them for free. We were not told that we would be charged $4.99 for them. We didn't even eat half of them before our food came. So that was a waste.     When the food came everything looked good. My husband liked his burger but said it was a little salty. My burger tasted good for the first two or three bites but then it started tasting very salty. Then about half way trough.....BAM !! I was ambushed by pickles . I hate pickles! I didn't ask for them so I don't know why they were on there, hideing under the lettuce.    Then to top it all off our bill was a shocker at $32.59 for two burgers, fries,$5 for chips and salsa and 2 Cokes.  I don't think we will ever go back to Chillies. Too expensive and the food is not that good. We should of just went across the street to Logan's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beavercreek,,,,,

13,Ethan G.,"Springboro, OH",42,13,4.0,1.0,2015-07-12,Terrible. I have been to chilies in multiple states multiple times and this one is terrible I had been to it in a while because the service was terrible the 3 other times I had been and the food was way over cooked. I ordered carry out about a week ago and the food was just as terrible but I thought maybe it was because of it being carry out so I decided to give it a shot again today. 3 of us walked in sat down for 15 minutes and didn't even get a hello we waited another 10 minutes and left. Letting the hosts know on the way out and they were nothing but rude that we even said anything. Will not be going back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beavercreek,,,,,

First visit I'd picked my meal up to go and the pick up area floor was very dirty. Besides the floors being filthy, my meal was incorrect.  Second visit I decided to dine in to give a second chance and this visit was worse! The floor was as dirty as the first visit and they sat my spouse and I near a table that was left with food and dirty dishes that another guest had left. The severs didn't clear the tables nearly 20 mins after. It took 40 mins to receive our meal. Waiter Calli was nice but not sure why it took so long to receive our meal. The location was not busy.

1,Mark A.,"Honolulu, HI",47,265,935.0,2.0,2017-06-20,"I ate here for lunch one day.  The food was ok, but the service was subpar.  I got there and was seated right away.  There were few other people in the restaurant. I sat down and ordered a margarita.  Despite this, I never received a glass of water.  How often do you eat at a restaurant in this country and get a glass of water automatically? Anyway, I ordered the mango lime chicken.  I tried asking my waitress questions about it or about other things on the menu but she was no help. Eventually I got my food and ate it.  The food was ok, but nothing special. Despite it being marked as spicy, all the heat was in the sauce, which was served on the side; it also meant that without the sauce, the chicken was rather bland. When I was done eating, I asked for the check, and it felt like it took a while to get.  Really, my whole experience here was a let down and I don't think I would go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beavercreek,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44

Asked for plain rice but was told this was the only type they served.  Sure can't call this Tex-Mex not even certain it could be called Mexican.  Will never eat here again. Only reason we tried this Chili's is because my wife had eaten the chicken dish at another Chili's and thought it was excellent. NOT HERE!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beavercreek,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
