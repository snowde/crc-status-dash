9,Robert G.,"Texarkana, TX",8,235,131.0,1.0,2012-10-26,"Just like Applebee's but not as good and more expensive. Who designed this place, anyway?  It feels dingy even though it isn't.   I had the $10 appetizer sampler.  They offer the same kind of thing at Applebee's, but Applebee's actually tastes good.  And my boneless chicken wings were cold, stone cold.  I think the problem is systemic rather than situational.  The place needs a makeover from the interior design to the recipes.  Ugh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beckley,,,,,
13,Guy P.,"Beckley, WV",0,5,2.0,5.0,2013-10-17,I don't know what happened to the other reviewers but I have always had good experiences here.   This time is no different.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beckley,,,,,
12,Jane B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",23,9,3.0,4.0,2013-11-24,Much cleaner than my last visit here two years ago. Seemed like the servers were trained well. Went in with party of eleven and everything went smoothly.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beckley,,,,,
5,Nekko S.,"Ridgecrest, CA",21,32,,1.0,2014-04-21,"I'll never eat at another chili's again. Don't get me wrong, most of the employees are great.  Chandra and Patricia and Stacie are some of the hardest working, nicest people you will ever meet.  I should know, I used to work there. Now, before you think ""here's another disgruntled ex-employee post"" hear me out.  I've worked at corporate and private restaurants, casual dining and resort.  I've done everything from dishwashing to managing so I feel I've earned a right to say a thing or two. My biggest issue with Chili's isn't the quality of the food, though most of it is pre-frozen and half mixed (those mashed potatoes? Half real potatoes and half mix. Same with most other things here.)  My issue comes from sanitation.  Yes, the restaurant seems clean enough, and it is.  I spent many evenings washing the kitchen floor.  The food, though...  I brought up a major issue with mixing old and new product to the kitchen manager and then the district manager, who informed me that all Chili's do the same thing - pour an old pan of dressing, salsa, cheese, whatever, into a new pan, fill it up and put a new date on it.  That ranch you're chowing down on could be a year old mixed in with fresh stuff.  That's just not the way to do it. I also remember vividly people grabbing chips or fries and dipping them into whatever they like, salsa, ranch, honey mustard.  I even saw a server once grab a handful of cheese and just nom it there over the pan.  Yes, I took it to the managers.  It's hard, though, when your GM is doing it, too. As for service, I was told the day I was let go that it wasn't the fact I'd had a seizure at work the day before but that I spent too much time with my customers and not enough time cleaning.  I knew then it was a horrid match and was happy to be out there door.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beckley,,,,,
14,Mel P.,"Byesville, OH",0,17,6.0,1.0,2014-04-22,I wish I could give this place 0 stars! Our server had no clue what was offered at the bar and was the slowest server I have ever had (even though she acted busy with us and another table). We waited a long time to get greeted and even longer to receive our drinks. Then she took our appetizer order and did not come back for our food order until we were well beyond finished with our appetizer. Poor service + subpar food = bad experience. Thank goodness for good company! I'm going to Applebee's next time!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beckley,,,,,
6,Joshua D.,"Sterling, VA",150,655,71.0,1.0,2014-05-13,"Still really bad. Just a wreck. See my previous reviews for the massive array of problems. But this time: - Ribs came out cold. Tasted OK flavor-wise, but they were straight up cold. - Dry rub on the ribs isn't supposed to also come on dry ribs. The meat should be tender and juicy. But the dry-rub ribs had actual dried-out meat. - Brought me the wrong drink. - Seating arrangement is just bad. They have tables out in the middle of walkways and they're too close to other patrons. The worst part was there were tons of empty booths but they chose to seat people at these tables instead. - Our server was whiny. She was whining about how they gave her her own section on her fifth day back from taking a month off or something. GUESS WHAT? The rest of us have much more stressful jobs that require more than walking back and forth between tables with food. We don't care. Get my drink right and do the one thing you are there to do correctly and then maybe you can whine even a little bit... but not really. Do your job with a smile and make us happy we came there. - The ribs seem expensive given that I could've gotten bigger, hotter, more flavorful ribs at a nonchain. - They have Ziosks here now. And they're just annoying. But I'd rather interact with those than any server I've ever had at this Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beckley,,,,,
10,Patrick M.,"Mount Hope, WV",24,7,,5.0,2014-07-06,I love the food. They also have some of the best drinks in the area. I've never had a negative experience. The servers and bartenders I've had are always fabulous.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beckley,,,,,
4,Lynn M.,"Danese, WV",15,58,1.0,4.0,2015-03-08,We were seated as soon as we walked in. Server seemed a bit in a hurry for us to order but I was slow this was the first time I've been in chili's in over ten years. Finally decided on the ribs which were awesome. Ribs came with fried potatoes which I didn't like they had some seasoning on them that tastes soured. The broccoli was great cooked just right. I didn't understand that you pay with the computer screen on the end of the table lol and had to ask. All in all was an ok experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beckley,,,,,
8,Ronald O.,"Louisville, KY",1,3,,3.0,2015-05-28,"Overnighted in Beckley.  Hadn't been to a Chili's in years and this seemed to be about as good as anyplace to eat while in town.  Restaurant was in good condition, clean and seating readily available. Waiter was quick to serve, and food, drinks, and salad were promptly delivered. Quality was good and being there was pleasant.  I was fascinated by the computer at the table for re-order of drinks or desserts, but especially enjoyed the pay at the table feature.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beckley,,,,,
11,Tom B.,"Beckley, WV",0,7,,3.0,2015-08-09,"Seated as soon as we walked in, waitress was quick to get our drink and appetizer orders. Entrees were served in a timely manner and everyone's glass stayed full. Cheeseburger was delicious except for the bun. I don't much care for theirs, it's reminds me of a pretzel bun. Still good eating and I'll return again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beckley,,,,,
7,Angela M.,"Beckley, WV",22,2,,1.0,2015-12-27,"I haven't been inside this particular Chili's, so I guess my issue is more with the chain itself, though I did just attempt to eat food from this location, via takeout. Chili's used to be my favorite restaurant.  My love affair with the chicken crispers began in 1994, in the suburbs of Detroit, Michigan.  I loved them, and for nearly 20 years, I ordered them anytime I was near a Chili's.   I can't tell you what happened... A couple of years ago, we were shopping at the location in Barboursville, WV.  Chili's was nearby, and I had not had it in a while, since there was not one near our home.  I ordered my beloved chicken crispers, and despite their typical golden color, they were quite possibly the worst thing I've ever tasted in a restaurant, EVER.  This includes a random experience with Wolf-fish while on my honeymoon many years before.  I asked for the manager, and told her I thought they tasted funny.  I asked her if perhaps the batter had changed, and she said no, they were the same as they always were, but she was happy to remake them for me.  I wish she had not wasted her inventory, because the second set tasted the same as the first.  Details? Sure. First off, the tenders should be called ""tender-ettes"", because they are not even quite half the size they used to be.  Two, the batter, that gloriously seasoned batter that was not even slightly crispy, despite their name, did not taste even remotely close to what I knew, remembered, and loved.  It was bland, flavorless, with a hint of old frying oil hanging about.  That alone would be a great sadness, but then I arrive at the chicken itself.  Despite being much smaller, and yet just as golden brown, the chicken didn't even taste DONE.  It was sinewy, chewy, with a weird after-taste. I  was able to eat the majority of one tender, and just had to stop.  Thank goodness the fries were good, and the corn, or I would have been hungry on top of disappointed.   Now I'm sure you are thinking, "" This was in Barboursville, WV,.... So lady, why are you griping on Beckley, WV's, page?"" Because it sadly does not matter what chili's I go to, I have the same experience.   Maybe the oil is old.  Maybe that's a location thing.  But the actual product is VASTLY different from what it used to be.  Tonight's to-go order is the third or fourth attempt by me in the past three years to rekindle that love for Chili's, and its just not possible.  Tonight, it only took one bite of that nasty chicken, one bite that I could not even chew without gagging and spitting out, before I raided the fridge for leftovers instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beckley,,,,,
2,Heather H.,"Raleigh, WV",24,145,46.0,3.0,2016-07-12,Our lunch today was not bad...they were understaffed and told us that immediately..but the experience was ok. The honey chipole chicken tenders were good as was the corn and the southwest mac n cheese. My son ate all of his steak and fries...we got the 2 for 20 meal and it was about 30 for all including tip. The server was working hard.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beckley,,,,,
1,D J.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",0,35,11.0,1.0,2016-07-19,Walked in and waited 15 minutes before someone even noticed me and my 5 year old son was standing there waiting for service. The waitress just sat and looked at us and finally we just walked out and went to Cheddars. Never again will I go back there!! No wonder at lunch there's only 6 cars total.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beckley,,,,,
3,Chuck C.,"Shady Spring, WV",23,4,,4.0,2016-08-29,"Love eating there, probably one of my favorite chain restaurants in Beckley to eat at. Foods great, clean, and always good service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beckley,,,,,
0,Bob M.,"Smyrna, GA",604,69,118.0,3.0,2018-01-07,Be sure to ask your server to repeat your order to make sure they got it right. If you have a coupon ditto on the request because you cannot get your appetizer order in until your dinner order is in.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-beckley,,,,,
