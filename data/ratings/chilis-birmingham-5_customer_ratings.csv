25,Police Lives Matter ..,"Greenville, SC",0,187,17.0,2.0,2012-05-30,"I had the steak & ribs which was not good. My server, Cory obviously has never been trained. He stood around in a daze, never checked on me and never asked how the food was.

20,Joshua S.,"Trussville, AL",62,106,614.0,2.0,2014-04-01,"If you were recently released from prison, you will love it! Chilli's is great. Just not this one... The food isn't bad, then again it's hard to screw up a bacon burger.  I normally frequent the chain when traveling as the menu is excellent; I wouldn't stop here on HWY 11 unless my appendix ruptured and needed a phone. Ok, maybe too harsh...  The bottom line is that it's inconsistent due to the overwhelmingly ""service without giving a sh^t"" attitude. You can tell when people love work, this group doesn't. I can't blame them, but I can avoid the disappointment. There is a mix of great wait staff and cooks, but don't cross your fingers for them.  If I want superior customer service, I will go to chick-fil-a, Publix, or establishments listed under adult services on craigslist. If I want a bacon burger and some methamphetamine, I will come here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-birmingham-5?start=20,,,,,
22,Buck B.,"Trussville, AL",1,44,,1.0,2015-05-08,"The food is not worth the price and the three times we've been here in the last two months, the service has been terrible!  Last night our waitress treated us like an after thought.  Not ever again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-birmingham-5?start=20,,,,,

12,John S.,"Trussville, AL",34,275,142.0,4.0,2015-10-05,"Picked up a Quesadilla Explosion Salad and appetizer trio (Southwestern Egg Rolls, Cheddar Bites and Boneless Buffalo Wings) to share for supper. Online ordering was easy and order was ready and accurate when arrived. I definitely recommend the car side to-go option.

15,Laronica C.,"Birmingham, AL",158,93,533.0,4.0,2016-01-17,"I can understand why this place has such low reviews in the past, but the last two times I've been to this location on Gadsden Hwy have been on point! Now, to be fair I had stopped going here a couple of years ago, except maybe to pick up a cheeseburger to go. And admittedly they previously had problems with being too slow when no one was there and food being lukewarm. But this location recently underwent a major renovation, which includes the menu, not just the building. This updated Chili's (atmosphere) reminds me of the Chili's of old and that's a good thing because I was always a fan. Years ago when I lived in other cities, Chili's was the fun, go-to place for large groups for economical eats and drinks. Maybe they listened to the complaints of bland food and slow service.   When I first moved to this side of town in '08 there weren't many sit-down restaurants and Bham wasn't really the foodie town it is now. There were more chain restaurants and for this area Chili's was pretty much it.  As other restaurants began popping up, the service here declined and so did the patronage. The parking lot was always empty and rarely was it ever busy. Then a few months ago I noticed new paint and a completely revamped building. It looks really good! So about a month ago we decided to check it out. Not only was I impressed with the updated menu options, but the prices totally agreed with my budget! They have several meal options 2 for $20 and 2 for $35 (which includes 2 Presidente margaritas).  They also have ""7 meal choices for $7 in 7 minutes"" during lunch. Normally when you have specials like that you don't get great meal choices, but those specials include some of their popular items. Chili's has gone back to its original Tex-Mex roots and incorporated a lot of flavorful dishes one might find in a regular Mexican restaurant.  The place was busy and bustling with activity and it was lively and fun! New tv's and layout give it a true sports bar feel on the bar side. And there are several tv's on the restaurant side but they aren't intrusive or loud. The service was excellent; our server Jeremy was really good and he was backed up by Nigel so we never needed anything.   Today I had chicken enchiladas and my friend had chicken burrito with beans. Both meals were excellent in taste and quality. The burrito was HUGE! My enchiladas came with rice and beans, topped with pico di gallo and a sweet corn and pepper mixture. Yum! It was a lot of food. The beans were spicy and very tasty and the rice was flavored with lime and cilantro. Yes, I was shocked to enjoy a true Mexican meal at Chili's but it happened! And I LOVE Mexican food and I would not steer you wrong!  Each of our meals were only $9.99 each. We did not get any alcoholic beverages, but the next time we will. I recommend giving Chili's another shot if you haven't been recently.  It's very obvious they worked hard to make some positive changes. Sometimes I don't feel like going to another side of town and I just need to eat without all of the extra-extra-ness! Next time I'll take pics!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-birmingham-5,,,,,
18,Brandon J.,"Birmingham, AL",89,5,,2.0,2016-01-29,Was seated and order drinks and appetizer pretty quick. Waited for close to an hour for entrees to come out and when they did they were luke warm.  Didn't want to send it back in fear of waiting a long time again. My fiancé got a Coke and something was in the glass. It looked like soggy bread. I am not one to complain so i didn't get any discounts for poor service. The waitress did apologize but told us several times our food was coming out and the. We waited longer.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-birmingham-5,,,,,
10,Rikesha F.,"Birmingham, AL",175,216,1363.0,2.0,2016-02-06,"This used to be my favorite location. Quality and service has really declined over the years.  On this visit I ordered the triple dipper as my meal. I chose the big mouth bites, southwestern egg rolls and crispy chicken crispers. The egg rolls were fine, but the chicken crispers were hard and looked more like nuggets or popcorn chicken instead of tenders. The cheese on the big mouth bites was hardened and there was hardly any bacon on the sliders.  My date ordered the avocado sirloin something. He got a small piece of beef that didn't resemble steak. No avocado either. In fact, he didn't even get the correct meal. When asked about it, the waitress told him that our server was new and he thought he wanted the regular sirloin. He ate it like a champ without complaining.  We ordered the caramel toffee brownie skillet for dessert. They didn't have any  toffee toppings nor nuts since ours didn't come with it. The waitress didn't tell us they were out, but she did apologize and asked if she could take it off of our ticket. We told her no, because to be honest, the entire meal was disappointing anyway.  Chili's, please do better. You are about to lose one of the last few loyal customers you have left.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-birmingham-5,,,,,
17,Shonda W.,"Birmingham, AL",63,163,33.0,4.0,2016-02-10,"Sad to see all the terrible reviews. I have always had great service at this location and the food is always very good. They always have some special going on which is nice, drink specials most of the day, and I usually have a free app coupon in my email.

Thank you for his service. 5 star for the food! 1 star for margarita- maybe the bartender can make it less salty. It's like we're drinking a sour mix and salt with no tequila and tri-sec.

The most recent trip was for lunch yesterday.  I was seated immediately and my waitress, while busy, was attentive and friendly.  The food was hot and good and was plentiful for only $7.

1,Gage M.,"Birmingham, AL",75,2,,1.0,2017-07-18,"Tonight I went to Trussville Chili's for dinner with my two daughters and their baby boys. The service was terrible. Some boy, I think his name was Matt, waited on us, and from what I could tell, he was training a young lady. He didn't bother to write our orders down, so it's no surprise he messed up our order. One of my daughters had ordered the Southwest Rolls, but then changed her mind and ordered the Cajun Pasta. This was while he was standing there taking our orders with no pen or paper. I then ordered last, asking for the BBQ chicken breast and 1/2 Rack of Ribs in a combo plate. He told my daughters that their dinners came with an appetizer as part of the 2 for $22., so they order the Texas Fries. When he brought the appetizer he didn't bring the little saucer plates. So when he came by a little later, we requested the plates. He said he would get them, he never did. Then when the dinners arrived, he brought my daughters their meals AND the Southwest Rolls, but NO combo plate for me! That's when he started calling me ""Sweetie"", a 53 year old woman, and he's calling me sweetie. I'm sure he thought it was cute or complimentary, I found it in very disrespectful, especially since completely left off my dinner. He took the egg rolls back and said he would get my dinner. When my daughters finished their meals, and mine had still not arrived, I asked the young lady working with him to just cancel it. He came by a little while after that and said, ""You want to just cancel your meal, okay, sorry Sweetie"". He was very flippant and arrogant. He then brought the ticket again, calling me ""Sweetie"" and said, ""you wanted just one check, right?""  I paid the $45 bill (The girls ordered a Margarita), of which I didn't even receive a meal, and I still tipped $10 because I wanted to make sure the girl got some tip money, but I really wish I hadn't left any tip. His attitude was infuriating. $55 spent to have my order lost and be insulted by the waiter.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-birmingham-5,,,,,
8,Adam G.,"Odenville, AL",0,4,,2.0,2017-08-06,"Went to the Trussville location August 5th for dinner with friends. Went for a late dinner, so it was not crowded and we were seated quickly for a party of 6. Ordered our drinks and those came out with no problem. I had a Long Island, others had beers or mixed drinks. Ordered our food and I ordered the prime rib tacos. While waiting for our food, we ordered another round of drinks. My second Long Island was horrible. Basically tasted like pure alcohol. My wife ordered another margarita. First one was the watermelon, second she just wanted a regular margarita. The waiter who also appeared to be the bar tender said he would make her a ""special one"". It came back biohazard green and had a dark green/black mixture in the bottom of it. Upon stirring it up, it just got worse. It tasted nothing like a margarita. She had him take it back and once again, she said she just wanted a regular margarita. Our food came out and the waiter wouldn't even put my tacos on the table. He said they weren't made right and was having them redone. Few minutes later he came back with new tacos. Not sure what my expectation was, but it basically tasted like crock pot roast with gravy thrown in soft taco shells with some lettuce. The beans were stone cold also.  When he returned with my wife's margarita, it was yellow and once again tasted nothing like a margarita. Other people in our group said their food was just ""okay"". Someone else had cold beans also. I gave this two stars only because our first round of drinks were good, otherwise it would have been one star. Our bill was over $60 and I left there hungry. Probably won't be back to this Chilis anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-birmingham-5,,,,,
7,Anna G.,"San Diego, CA",59,6,,1.0,2017-08-19,"Went here for lunch, it was just me, sat at the bar. Waited over 20 minutes for them to tell me they didn't have what I ordered. They weren't busy, wasn't peak lunch hour. Will not be going back. This is why supporting local establishments is so important. These big chains don't value their customers. I didn't even get an apology.  Go to Jim & Nicks in the same parking lot. They're always sweet and welcoming, and take great care of their guests.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-birmingham-5,,,,,

3,Samuel P.,"Center Point, AL",165,273,773.0,3.0,2017-09-16,"I ended up meeting some friends during a late Friday afternoon and think goodness that it wasn't crowded yet, but that all change once we got ready to leave. I was surprised that they have the prices for alcohol beverage displayed on the menu since most restaurants don't do that and since Chili's alcohol beverages are affordable, that's a plus for me. I normally don't order cocktail drinks unless I'm on vacation, but since the prices are reasonable, I just figure what the heck. The drink I ended up getting was called the Coconut State of Mind and it definitely put me in a good state of mind. My friend order chips and salsa and they must've made changes on the chips because they're not as thin as I recall, but the salsa is still the same. My main course I had was a Southern Smokehouse Burger with fries and even though the burger was good and juicy, I was disappointed that it wasn't as big as I would've like. Our waitress Jasmine was positive, engaging, and checked on us during our whole dinner and I hope to have her again as my waitress next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-birmingham-5,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84
4,Jennifer S.,"Jackson, GA",0,28,1.0,1.0,2017-12-03,"Avoid if you can. We went for dinner while visiting family, our service started out good but unfortunately went down hill from there. When my food came out it was awful so I ordered something else which is something I rarely do. The service was painfully slow, we had to wait for food and drink refills. When the check came they tried to charge me $10 extra ""because the computer couldn't add it correctly."" What?? Make sure you check your bill carefully if you eat here. My food not being good was not the waitresses fault but trying to extort $10 out of me was. The manager never even came over to check with our table. Poor management, improper staffing and bad food.

The steak quesadillas were good and so was the chips and salsa our waiter even brought us a fresh Bach of chips and salsa which was good overall I thought my experience here was good,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-birmingham-5,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8
