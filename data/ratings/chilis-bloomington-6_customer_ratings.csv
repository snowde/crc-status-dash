24,Kay S.,"St Paul, MN",29,5,1.0,1.0,2012-03-20,"I work in Bloomington and our office usually orders lunch out 3-4 days a week.   We tried Chili's to go online ordering last week for the first time.  Absolutely everything we ordered was wrong and of course we didn't check it before returning to the office.  The steaks were cooked wrong, the meals were missing bread, they sent the wrong sauce for our appetizer and also didn't put the jalapenos on the side as their online menu offers.  I called and spoke to the manager who offered to send out gift certificates.  We did get the gift certificates, $20 even though our meals were $32, and tried them again today.  Today, our meals included bread and the steaks were cooked right, however, they again forgot the sauce for the appetizer.  Also, the ""fried cheese"" had a very freezer-burned taste.  Very disappointed as Chili's is one of the chains that I usually like.  I really think they need to double check their to go orders better.  Maybe the service inside the restaurant is better, but definitely don't trust the take out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bloomington-6?start=20,,,,,
9,Tim S.,"Edina, MN",288,207,941.0,1.0,2012-11-25,"I have gone to this location for a very long time, but not in Yoda years.  I've lived in the neighborhood for over 16 years, so it's a place to go. I know what to expect, and it's a good place to go with friends for happy hour or to grab a bite to eat. Most of the time service is good, but today, it was a nightmare.  We had to wait at least 10 minutes to place a drink order. Finally, I saw one of the servers say ""Could you let Stephanie know Table 57 is hers?"" to someone. She only had a couple of tables in her section, so I don't know why she couldn't handle it. The other server probably noticed that we were about to walk out, so she took our drink order and explained that Stephanie was busy. She then decided that it was probably best to take our food order too. I ordered a soup and salad, and after the first few slurps of my soup, I noticed something that appalled me: there was a hair in my soup. Since my black/grey hair is receding and this hair was of Chewbacca color and length, I knew it wasn't mine. I asked to speak to the manager, who came over, apologized and offered more soup. I told her that was not an option since it obviously would come from the same pot. So she offered to take it off the bill. Stephanie eventually came around, never apologized for the long wait or for the soup, and when I received the bill, I had to remind her to take off the soup. It saddens me to leave a crappy review for Chili's but considering I had crappy service, they left me no choice. I'm sure I'll be back, but two thumbs way down for this visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bloomington-6,,,,,
19,Steve C.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,4,,1.0,2013-09-13,Had lunch with family here last week and food was terrible.  My 8 year old loves ribs but totally called the lame dish spot on.  My wife's veggies were too salty and it was a blah experience overall  regards to the food.  Service was ok given not many there on a weekend lunch...now I know why.  This is $55 I wish I had back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bloomington-6,,,,,
17,Eric G.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,3,,5.0,2014-07-14,"Get the beef fajitas! I've gone to this location (and other Chili's elsewhere) a number of times and usually order the above because it is almost uniformly excellent. Beef is tender and lean and very tasty, which is the heart of any good fajita, and the rest of the ingredients are good, too. And the quantity is just right, you come away feeling well fed but not stuffed. Also, the basic chips and salsa were quite good, too, especially by Midwest standards. And, finally, service was friendly and efficient and the little devices on the tables make it easy to pay the bill and add the tip you want while allowing the staff to focus more on the rest of the customers.  5/5",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bloomington-6,,,,,
16,K O.,"Victoria, MN",0,5,,4.0,2014-08-24,Haven't eaten at this chili's for years. Wasn't sure what to expect based on the few recent reviews I read.  Was pleasantly surprised by the service and food. Enjoyed a wonderful lunch. The waiter was attentive and knew what to recommend from the menu. Everyone in my party enjoyed the food - from the chips & salsa to the burgers and fresh Mex fare. We'll be back !,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bloomington-6,,,,,
6,Ericka A.,"Chicagoland, IL",1239,1525,2754.0,4.0,2014-09-11,"You know what? I can't hate on them. I recognize that the food isn't authentic, but it was tasty, it was abundant, it was reasonably priced, and it was one of the few places my dad and I could agree on. It also doesn't hurt that they have 2-for-1 margaritas, which made dealing with my dad during a rough time all the more bearable. Service was prompt and they had no problem accommodating my father's dietary restrictions. They have these new devices on the tables that allow you to place orders yourself or call your server. We never used them because our waiters were never far from our table. The steak fajitas are my go-to here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bloomington-6,,,,,
14,Yohann T.,"Minnetonka, MN",10,69,108.0,5.0,2015-06-22,"Been here a handful of times with my wife and also with my siblings. There were a few times when my wife ordered margaritas and she ended up getting two, not realizing it was HH. She absolutely loves it. The food and service is great! Even during busy times, we've never had to wait more than 15 minutes. We recommend this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bloomington-6,,,,,
15,Teresa E.,"Minot, ND",4,9,44.0,5.0,2015-08-07,Best salsa ever! Wish they were complimentary though. Never had to pay more a dollar for bottomless chips and salsa ($5.99). Very good food and happy with portion size. Staff was friendly and the establishment was clean. The menu was a little big and slightly overwhelming but I also liked having choices- just took a minute for someone as indecisive as myself to decide. Simple and easy to reach from the highway.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bloomington-6,,,,,
3,Jim P.,"Lynnwood, WA",102,424,364.0,3.0,2015-11-03,"Living now in the Seattle area after living in the SW (Oklahoma & Texas) for many years, I have always enjoyed Chilis diverse menu and when I travel, seek out opportunities to continue enjoying their delicious salsa, fajitas, soft tacos and of course their tart & limey house frozen margaritas.  This visit, there was a ""promotional"" prime rib supplement to the regular menu offering new items that I could not resist!   When my order was placed in front of me, the smothered (mild verde sauce) prime rib burrito sided with black beans was a monstrosity that almost filled the entire platter, much too large a portion for my lunch so I left about a third of my meal behind. The content of my leftover lunch was almost entirely rice as I had already picked out the few tasty morsels of marinated meat. To be honest the menu should have disclosed this meal as a smothered rice burrito with prime rib pieces added and if I were to order again, would request the server to ask the kitchen to substitute a smaller quantity of black beans or refried beans rather than all of that filler which doesn't belong in a meat burrito anyway!  Service was friendly and my tea was replenished once. Price was in line for a sit down meal and my three star visit could easily have been 4 stars if it were not for all that rice!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bloomington-6,,,,,
12,Sean L.,"Minneapolis, MN",21,21,44.0,2.0,2015-12-13,This location has good staffing. I would have to say the margaritas here are awesome. Other than that the rice here wasn't the good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bloomington-6,,,,,
13,Donavan B.,"Chicago, IL",0,39,,1.0,2016-01-16,They need to update their sanitizing procedures with their employees.  I travel around the country and visit a lot of Chili's.  This one by far was the worst.  Witnessed first hand a bar tender wiping down the bar with a rag and next step was to grab the INSIDE of a glass to fill with water for a patron.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bloomington-6,,,,,
11,T. Allan P.,"Winnipeg, Canada",0,28,4.0,3.0,2016-04-03,"Seated right away, but you can tell they are going for speed rather than quality in their food. Seasoning wasn't great on anything. I ordered the fajitas and was quite surprised when I was brought 3 dishes out as I had to make my own fajitas. It wouldn't have been terrible, but they seated us at such a tiny table to begin with. So while everyone else is eating their food, I'm making mine. And they give you more food than the actual tortilla's are able to hold. I wasn't a fan.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bloomington-6,,,,,
4,Abhishek M.,"Chicago, IL",96,158,497.0,3.0,2016-05-27,"Standard Chili's menu and experience. However, the reason for 3 stars is finding a fly in my Arnold Palmer, one that was missed by the bar tender and server. Sure they replaced my drink but it was after I took a sip! Glad to not be a vegetarian, for a change.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bloomington-6,,,,,
10,Tim J.,"Norwood Young America, MN",12,13,,3.0,2016-05-28,"Walked into the place to see two large groups waiting too be seated. One group was seated prior to the a group that was already there waiting. They said they were going to leave because a few groups had been seated before them even though they gave their name, and sat down. I walked around and saw 5 empty tables and a few booths completely open. Then as I am standing at the hosting desk a man comes up and crabbily tells me he has groups ahead of me. I need to sit down and wait. Did not ask my name, had a face on like his job was an unpleasant task. His name was Greg, and he seemed to be a manager or supervisor of some sort.- not sure.  Before I could say anything he took a group of people who had come in 10 minutes after us that were behind em to a table. Same number in their group (3). No one else was left at the front, and Greg told me to sit down, practically demanded it and said he would be with me in a bout 10 minutes. I just looked at him, and said we would like to request a table. Then another fellow came along and started to take a group that had just walked in as Greg was telling me to wait to their table. Then that guy looked at me and asked if I was waiting. I said yes and we were taken to a table. No menu and colors for the kiddo. Wait time for a table. over 20 minutes and no one at the front most of the time.  I remarked to my daughter that I would be getting on Yelp tonight. The David came along to wait on us. He was smiling, professional and patient as we took some time deciding what to order. Once our glasses of soda were empty David was right there to refill them without a wait. David was friendly and the meal was good. Not great, but good fare for a casual dinner out at good prices. There is a good selection at chili's as well. David saved the day making our experience here a pleasant one. Whoever is in charge of seating people and letting the hosting station stay unmanned for up to 10 minutes at a time, and the  someone walks up and grabs people at random should get some retraining. Maybe Greg was having an off day though I think he just does not like his job.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bloomington-6,,,,,
7,Barry N.,"Minneapolis, MN",0,4,,3.0,2017-01-28,It seems the portions on the fajitas for 2  has been decreased and the portion size on the condiments is not enough for 2 people. The fajitas are still tasty but they are cutting corners on portion size.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bloomington-6,,,,,
8,Guillermo L.,"Inver Grove Heights, MN",11,2,,5.0,2017-03-24,Great experience. The manager Alberto was very helpful. Love going here and I'd definitely recommend it to friend,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bloomington-6,,,,,

2,Murphy A.,"Eagan, MN",7,1,,1.0,2017-12-12,"There was something black in my sprite, the manager came to my table and says she didn't know what it was, she suggested it may have been dust but clearly it wasn't, it looked more like he kind of mold that grows around moisture. I was given 50% discount on my bill like I really needed it. Chili's is off my list of places to dine cause I'm questioning the cleanliness of this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bloomington-6,,,,,
1,Mark M.,"Minneapolis, MN",5,25,1.0,4.0,2018-01-05,"Standard chili's experience, with a very attentive server who filled our water any time it was below half full. I got the chicken fajitas which were too much for one sitting and my fiancée got the Cajun chicken pasta. Both dishes very good. The waitress forgot to apply the discount to the bill and then had charged us for 2 sodas when we didn't have any. The bathroom was citrusy clean and properly stocked.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bloomington-6,,,,,
0,Lisa L.,"Eden Prairie, MN",22,31,86.0,4.0,2018-01-12,"I am not a huge fan of large chain restaurants but here I am giving this place four stars. Why? Well, they have a large free parking lot, competent servers, a wide variety of  meals to choose from and also my father in law gave us a one hundred dollar gift card for the holidays. Can you say free Long Island? Now you can see the reason for the four stars. Went here last weekend. Sat in the bar. Duh. Who wants to eat within view of kiddos? Not this chick. Sorry not sorry.  First up, drinks. I ordered the obvious Long Island. Husband had a Surly Furious, 22 oz. because I did not marry no 16 oz. man.  Second, food. I tried the Ultimate Bacon Burger. I had no regrets. Huge burger dripping with several sauces. Ladies, do not order this on a first date. Messy as hell but just as delicious. There were also fries. Just as tasty. Husband had the Honey Chipotle Crispers & Waffles. Not my jam but he has ordered it before and liked it enough to order it again so there it is. He picked off the jalapeños but have no fear I did not let them go to waste. Third, dessert. Sadly after all that food and 2 drinks each there was no room for dessert. But there is still money left on that gift card so we shall we back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bloomington-6,3.2,3.2,3.2,,3.2000000000000006
