11,Jason L.,"Canfield, OH",3,21,,4.0,2013-01-02,"Good food, good prices, great service on 12/29/12 for dinner, like the low calorie menu",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-boardman,,,,,
10,Elaine B.,"NORTH LIMA, OH",29,14,15.0,4.0,2013-04-03,"Just stopped in for some appetizers, food and service very good and friendly.  Prices are reasonable. Our servers name was Tara and she was awesome.  Wasn't really hungry but decided to order the skillet queso.  My fault, I should have read the menu, thought it was more of a hot cheese dip you get at Mexican Restaurants.  This was more of a spicy thick chilli bean dip.  Tara noticed I wasn't really diggin' it and when she asked me what was wrong, I just told her it was my fault by the person I was with was eating it just fine.  She came by again and told us that she took it off the bill because she wanted us to be happy.  Even though I told her it was my own fault she still politely took it off.  We will go there again.  We do enjoy their food and service.  I love the coupons there too!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-boardman,,,,,
13,Draft D.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,44,3.0,3.0,2014-05-04,"Good staple when everywhere else is packed. Food is ok, service is bland but consistently average for a chain and prices are a little high but tolerable. Better than Cheddar s and Olive Garden but not as good as Texas Road House.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-boardman,,,,,
14,Bekka O.,"Lisbon, OH",0,3,,5.0,2014-06-03,I would go to Chili's at least once a month if my boyfriend liked spicy food. Now I only get to go every once in a while when a friend can go with me. Their food is absolutely amazing. Chips and salsa; to die for. They have great deals like 2 for $20 and it's a nice way to get great food for cheap. All the waiters/waitresses I've ever had were nice and there to get you exactly what you need. Definitely recommend this place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-boardman,,,,,
12,Elizabeth C.,"Columbiana, OH",0,3,,5.0,2014-10-20,The chicken fajitas are my favorite! Great food and great service! My family and I eat there all of the time and we have never had a bad experience. The new Flatbreads are very good as well definitely worth a try,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-boardman,,,,,
4,Liz P.,"Struthers, OH",59,39,39.0,3.0,2015-09-14,"Meh? What can I say that will not make you turn your back and run. So I will do this review in categories... Food: Mediocre at best. The quality is not like it used to be, and that is the way it is now with 75% of restaurants. The owners want to save cash so they end up cutting corners so then the quality goes down the tubes then when they decide they don't want to give you a quality product they settle on second rate, run of the mill food and then wonder why they lose sales. End Rant. Go to product: Chicken and guacamole sandwich and chips and salsa. Service: its O.K...I will be honest, I gone there and had great servers and I have gone there and had crappy servers. No matter what I still tip 20% or more so you crappy servers better step up your game. Convenience: Here is the best one. It is right on the corner of 224 and Market St. in the mall parking lot. Atmosphere: Let's just say that the corporate world of Chili's does not seem to care about this store. The bathrooms have needed some serious work for years and now have a horrid smell along with the water on the floors, the tiles cracking and missing. I am sure management is aware but must need bonuses because the sales or so low because of the mediocre food.  Its Dusty and dingy and most of the tables wobble and if you sit at the bar you can tell it needs to be deep cleaned because you can smell the drains sitting there.  It just needs some serious TLC... On a positive note they have nice T.V's and if your favorite game is on the bartender will usually turn the volume up for you. So all and all if you like your typical corporate food, mediocre atmosphere, dirty bathrooms, dusty booths, wobbly tables and smelly bars then you should go here. Unless, you are getting their chips and salsa because that is about one of the only reasons I go back. There is also lots of local places in Boardman that are not corporately owned that blow this place out of the water! Try One!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-boardman,,,,,
8,Punky R.,"New Castle, PA",1,3,,1.0,2015-10-28,"Horrible experience. There are much better places in the area.  Once we sat down, we sat there for over ten minutes before a waiter came to greet us and take our drink order. While we were waiting, we noticed napkins and straw wrappers on the floor in every direction we looked. I had to wipe off our table myself with a wet nap I had in my purse because it was sticky and gross. We were about to get up and leave when the waiter finally came to our table. When we did order, we got the white queso and fajitas. When the appetizer arrived, it was the wrong one. When we got the correct one, our dinners came out immediately after, so we didn't have time to eat the queso.  We didn't have time to taste the food before the waiter came to ask how everything was. She was immediately followed by the manager, who asked the same thing. We answered that we hadn't had a chance to taste the food yet, and the manager left. We didn't see either until it was time to get the check. When we tasted the food, it was bland, and my shrimp was almost completely raw. I wanted to send it back, but the waiter never came back to our table except to give us the check. She offered us dessert but never mentioned boxes for the food we couldn't eat.  This entire experience was absolutely horrible from start to finish. Save yourself a headache and go elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-boardman,,,,,
9,JD D.,"New Castle, PA",0,16,,1.0,2016-03-12,"The worst service and food prep ever experienced.  We were a group of 5 ppl and our waitress was not interested in serving us from the start.  Asked for waters, it took 20 minutes to get them.  We ordered fried pickles, it took 20 minutes and they could not have been pickles.  Saw onion and garlic pieces.  WTH?  Ordered boneless wings looked reheated.  Service was rough going all the way through and the manager Sat there and did nothing.  Never walked around, never asked if anyone's food was good.. Nothing.  Actually saw him look at us toward end of night like we had done something wrong.  What a disappointment.  Terrible may be to kind.  Still gave a 10% tip because we know the service industry is difficult but we never should have left a penny.  Suggestion: Go elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-boardman,,,,,
5,Jeanine D.,"Youngstown, OH",3,6,27.0,4.0,2016-06-10,"I picked up Chili's to go. They have parking right by the door, so quick and easy access. My foods was ready and it was exactly what I ordered including the extra sauce. The food is good and the poison size is the same as if I was dining there. Some restaurants like to skim on takeout orders.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-boardman,,,,,
6,Mark V.,"Berlin Center, OH",0,6,1.0,1.0,2016-11-04,We came for guacamole. They ran out on Friday nite. What? Bad managing. They said they have hard avocados.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-boardman,,,,,
1,Leslie H.,"Niles, OH",27,79,570.0,5.0,2016-12-09,Stopped in for a quick dinner. Ordered off of the 2 for 20 menu.  I got the chicken fajitas and Hubby ordered the steak for an up charge of 2 dollars.  I would recommend trying the fajitas. Well seasoned with warm tortilla shells.     Ordered a side of guacamole which was fresh and delicious.  Service was great but the beer is a little pricy by the bottle. Cheaper if you order a draft beer. They have happy hour at the bar but all the seats were taken.  oh well next time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-boardman,,,,,
0,Chelsea M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",304,744,469.0,4.0,2017-03-30,"my family and I stopped in Monday for dinner. We ordered 2 apps... Loaded Nachos and a Chipotle Chicken Flatbread. Both apps were delicious. I ordered the Sante Fe Salad. the salad had chicken, diced avocado, salsa, tortilla strips, ranch and santé fe sauce. the sauce had a great heat and the salad was delicious!!  Other members of our party ordered the sunny side up burger, Caribbean salad, fajitas and a smoked burrito. Everyone enjoyed their meal but I heard a few dislikes from the Caribbean salad and smoked burrito (particularly the sauce and dressing on each)  For desset, we all shared 2 molten lava cakes.... Salted Caramel and Chocolate. omg they were both FABULOUS!!!! I plan on heading to chili's soon just for dessert! Chelsea was our server and she did a nice job of keeping up with our party. I see myself here for happy hour very soon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-boardman,,,,,

3,Bill S.,"Avon Lake, OH",17,1,,4.0,2017-06-02,Awesome fajitas and chips and queso dip! Also enjoy the sunrise burger! The service is usually very good and prices are reasonable.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-boardman,,,,,
2,Steve R.,"Beachwood, OH",1,9,,2.0,2017-07-15,"Stopped in knowing what to expect, yet I was disappointed. Hostess was packaging silverware, handling every fork by the tines, when I commented to her she said she had washed her hands. Table top was sticky and video ordering game gizmo was covered in layers of filth. My chicken was served cold (not just cool, actually cold). Manager needs to step up their game. The bill comes and we had been charged a $1.99 ""entertain fee.""  I pointed it out to server who took it off bill. I wonder how many people get scammed like that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-boardman,,,,,
