We were immediately blown when they said they don't do the unlimited salsa and chips combo anymore. Like honestly that was the only reason we had even decided to come (Chili's might b my least fave out of the Fridays/Applebees clan). After we got over that shock we got the 2 for 20. He got some pasta dish and I got the Bacon Ranch Chicken Quesdilla. I must say I was I was pleasantly surprised. It was really Bad, Michael Jackson Bad! Our waitress was friendly and prompt too. I gotta say this might have been my most pleasant experience at a Chili's yet. Would I say I'm a born again fan?

Granted I haven't been to a Chilis restaurant in probably 7 months and the last one was in Short Pump in Richmond, VA. We ordered the chips and salsa and were surprised you no longer get free refills! We also ordered the southwest egg rolls which are about 1/2 the size they used to be...but still delicious. I ordered the BLT Quesadilla. It was very small but the guacamole was what really made this yummy. Hubby had the sliders- always delicious.

56,Brook H.,"Columbia, MD",58,287,220.0,4.0,2013-01-10,"I have to warn you that my experience was possibly influenced by the fact that my Brother-in-Law is a manager at the central training Chili's for the region. Therefore, upon his announced arrival, we were treated to an excellent experience. I cannot guarantee that your experience will be the same, barring having a relative that is ~also~ a manager at a central training restaurant for your region. The food here was quite good, especially the Southwestern Eggrolls. I could eat those all day and night, even with the consequences of devouring so much fried food. I decided to order the Monterey Chicken and wasn't disappointed. There wasn't a single complaint from our entire party of 10 (+2 toddlers) about anything we received. I think one of the cool things about Chili's are the electronic touchscreen devices at each table. You can put on clips of shows (good for the kids), play various games (some free, some cost a dollar), or even order drinks from the bar (warn your server, though). So, based on my experience, I enjoyed this Chili's a lot.

46,Mom To One B.,"Bowie, MD",1,17,,5.0,2013-04-11,"This review is based on my carry-out experiences. We go to chili's about three times a month and get carry out. The servers always make sure everything is In the bag. If you ask for extra of anything, they always put it in the bag. When we get there, the order is always ready. We usually get about three meals and desserts in our order and they always make sure everything is perfect. I appreciate this because there are times when you get carry-out and everything is thrown in your bag, things are forgotten, you have to go back inside to get things and the order isn't ready at the time they give. I appreciate chili's because they treat the carry-out customers the same way as the customers dining in. I never have to worry about going through my bag to make sure everything is in there, and the food is always good. I wish I could say the same thing about Bob Evans.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bowie?start=60,2.2920000000000003,2.2920000000000003,2.2920000000000003,2.2920000000000003,2.2920000000000003

53,Tiffany S.,"Silver Spring, MD",43,9,1.0,2.0,2014-03-02,"I have never written a review before, but after visiting this Chili's I just had to write a review and WARN future guests. This Chili's management is very, very poor. Here is my story. It was a Saturday at around 1 pm when I entered. Nobody was at the front to greet me, and after waiting 10 minutes I went to ask the nearest waitress if we were going to be seated. The restaurant was not packed, in fact there might have been ten groups of people only.  After about 5 more minutes of waiting (now we are at 15 min of waiting before being seated in an empty restaurant) the manager finally seats us. He doesn't tell us who our server was. There are no utensils or plates on the table. 10 min later our server approached us. He was cheery, and overall a great server, which is why I blame the management. We ordered drinks and our entrees. Drink service was slow (but the drink was good) and our food even slower. While I was waiting, I noticed that people were gathered at the front door waiting to be greeted. At one point it looked like there were about ( sets of people, and nobody was there to greet and seat them. It was just shocking to me. The manager came back to our table and told me that he apologizes for my food taking a while but When the food came out, it was not up to their standards . I had ordered boneless buffalo wings. Having just gotten over a bout of food poisoning a week ago I was scared. The food finally came and was good and I did not get sick.  Bottom line, is that the service is EXTREMELY slow, and to me, the good and drink are not worth the terrible service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bowie?start=40,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152

59,Mary J.,"Washington, DC",0,18,,2.0,2014-04-20,"I have been to Chili's before and this stands out as a particularly bad location. I would not recommend it. First, there was a 20 minute wait  even though there were plenty of open seats. We had the worst seat - on a corner between the kitchen, the register, and the restroom even though there were plenty of open seats away from those areas - lots of foot traffic and noise. We ordered appetizers that were not even lukewarm - they were cold.  The waitress was nice but she was slow. When we got our bill it had a charge for a table game. I complained because there was no clear notice that there were any charges associated with the electronic thing on our table and I would not have let my child touch it if the possibility of charges was clearly  displayed. (I may elevate this complaint to a government agency. They should not have those things on the table unless the potential charges are clearly marked.) The waitress removed the charges for the cold food and the game. She brought out the appetizer again and it was still cold. Overall, there was enough bad here for me to say I would not return.

39,Sean C.,"Washington, DC",0,95,,3.0,2014-11-25,"I've been going with my family off and on for about 10 years. I can relate to the negative reviews here but those are not our typical experiences. If you're doing some shopping in the area it's an OK place to stop by for lunch -- it is not a destination. We have found the food consistently good and servers pleasant.  As mentioned in another review, there is the odd phenomenon of showing up after 1 pm on a Saturday and Sunday and having trouble getting seated, even though half the tables are empty. Sometimes during those times, someone who is clearly the manager, and also apparently his wife, are waiting tables. This points to a staffing problem, maybe not hiring as many servers as they need.  We were recently seated at a table in the bar area for the first time, and apparently served by someone not a regular server (not the bartender -- maybe a kitchen worker). It was OK, except for a blond woman -- a BIG Maryland football fan -- sitting at the bar swearing up a storm. We were sitting with kids and a little embarrassed.  I'd say most of our experiences are OK, enough that we go back, but operations could defiantly be tightened up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bowie?start=20,2.6,2.6,2.6,2.444,2.6

55,Laila M.,"Goddard, MD",0,2,,1.0,2015-03-16,"I should have left when I stepped foot in the joint, but I allowed myself to get too hungry and I was dying for a burger. I would normally go to the Chilis in Rockville and have always received great food and service.  But as for THIS location in BOWIE... :-( 1. The restaurant is filthy. I have no idea if they just do not have any one to sweep that dirty floor or what, but they have absolutely no problem seating you at a table with piles of trash under it.  2. I should have mentioned that you WILL walk in to an empty hostess station. There will be no one there to seat you and you will be just standing there looking hungry and confused. The more desperate you look, the better. Someone will eventually realize that you actually are standing there because you would like to be seated.  3. Food- Pray over it!  Twice. Once I made it to a table and summoned a server, I knew right then that I had no business even ordering my food because God just sent me several signs that I shouldn't be eating at this establishment! Sigh ...  Anyway, I order a Smokehouse Burger and a side salad. When I saw a server bringing  my salad to the table, I started praying right away that it would be ok. I was HUNGRY!  What do I see when I look down? A friggin hair right on the plate! Damn damn damn! So I let the server know that I think it was time for me to leave and she said she completely understood. She went to get the mgr who apologized and said that my burger was ready. He asked very nicely for me to please stay and enjoy my burger as he was going to take ""care"" of the meal. I told him my concerns with the untidiness of the place and my questions regarding the cleanliness of the food prep area. He assured me my burger would be ok.   So I reluctantly said ok after doing an extensive examination of the plate. The burger was fine but the potato bun was not soft at all. I had to saw it with my knife. Potato rolls should not be hard.  Bottom line: There is no need to go on.  I will NOT go to this particular Chilis ever again.

My food came out cold broccoli had black fungus not cooked raw.

Monet was not the least bit apologetic about any of this. Instead she cowardly want to get the management to correct her mishaps instead of handling it herself. She clearly does not think like an owner for this restaurant all she was doing seems to be like she's collecting a check.  With that being said my bar experience proceeded to take a turn for the worst.  Monet had a bad attitude and was coming off annoyed.

While trying to use the monitor, I later discovered it wasn't working for me to order.  I noticed 15 minutes later, while talking to my girls and trying to understand the monitor, that no one had greeted us or even asked if we wanted something to drink. Finally, a young guy walks up and introduces himself and takes our drink order.  Ten minutes have passed and we still haven't received ANYTHING.  Finally , another guy named Charles came by and said he was covering for my server because he had other tables to cover.  He only covered one table and that family came in after me and he only served that table. I found that to be weird that he left our table to deal wothnsomeone else and give them the utmost respect and service. Charles took our drink orders AGAIN and proceeded to take our order for appetizers.  I didn't want to wait along time for anything else so I decided to order everything so we didn't have to keep ordering and waiting. I ordered the salmon, ribs with mashed potatoes and southwestern Mac n cheese for dinner and my girls ordered chicken crispers and fries.   My ribs were tough and the southwestern Mac n cheese was horrible.  The mango lemonade was too.sweet.  I eventually had a bad headache after my meal.   Despite all of this, charles was attentive, courteous and overall nice.  I didn't want to get angry with him because of the other two people who weren't good at all.  There was another server there who had her hair up in a ponytail and she knocked out her tables with problem as well.  I didn't catch her name but I just wanted to put my review out.  That location has to do better. Its no way that a busy restaurant like that wasn't properly staffed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bowie?start=20,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.6320000000000006,2.44

Ordered chicken strips and broccoli for baby boy. But after his meal was served, he decided he wanted fries and broccoli, instead. Keri-Ann quickly put the order in for fries. (I tried a piece of the chicken strip. It was pretty darn tasty, I must say.) I ordered prime rib tacos, 7 year-old had burger sliders and hub ordered the fajitas. It was good. Typical chain restaurant food. The mixed berry margarita was VERY syrupy and too sweet. Ugh.  Anywho. The total for the 4 of us was $78. We enjoyed Keri-Ann, who was very personable.

This location definitely isn't as great as the one that used to be in Annapolis, but since it shut down this one is the only option.  The food was alright. We started with the chips and salsa which is always my go to! Love the fresh salsa so much and I always get an order to go. I also got the half rack of baby back ribs, and although the meat was sparse, the flavor was really good. Fries seemed a bit over cooked and greasy but were seasoned well. My mom really liked the ranch dressing that came with her salad. Make sure to end the night with the molten cake, which is by far my favorite chain restaurant dessert out there. The service was pretty slow, and our waiter overcharged our check initially. Had we not looked at the receipt, we would have been charged $12.00 for two iced teas.

I never got a chance to eat because the bartender had such a bad attitude I had to leave. I sat at the bar where only 4 people were sitting (Not busy yet). She ignored me and walked to the back cooking area. She finally comes out and I order a beer. I told her I was ordering food but make it to go. She told me to go to another place in the restaurant to place my order. I asked her why she can't just take my order while I'm at the bar and put it ""to go"". She immediately gets a major attitude, raises her voice and says ""You can do it your way"" 3 times. She began pouring my beer but then walked back to talk to the cooking staff. She comes back and says, ""your beer is coming"" and goes to chat with someone else (ignoring me). I got up and walked out.

The restaurant area is kept separate from the bar area -- I choose to go to the bar 1) to get the HH deals and 2) so that I don't have to wait for a table.  Be careful when choosing seating at the bar -- If you sit in the wrong section you'll feel a draft from either the front or back door.  I'd recommend you sit towards the middle of the bar to avoid the draft. The service is always friendly and pretty quick.  I've noticed that service at the bar is quite a bit faster than the service at the tall bar tables. The happy hour specials are fantastic!  Half off most appetizers except for the larger combo platters.  There are $4 wine specials, $3 beers, and $3 rail specials.  Can you really beat these prices?  These aren't the strongest drinks I've ever had at a happy hour -- for $3, just get a few rounds and you'll be a-okay. The food is just alright -- good, but nothing to write home about.  There are a lot of diverse options on both the entree menu and the list of appetizers.  I usually go with an order of the wings and the texas cheese fries. I'll keep coming back because I can get a few drinks and a couple of appetizers for around $20 + tip.  Pretty good HH find if you're not trying to break the bank.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-bowie,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004

No server offered us or even stopped by. We grabbed a servers attention after waiting 15 min after 5:35. The server said that he would find out what was going on and still didn't even come back to let us know what was going on.
