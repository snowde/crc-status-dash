35,John F.,"Nashville, TN",1,91,,5.0,2012-01-02,Ate there with a friend for lunch. Greeted right away and sat at the bar. Drink order was taken immediately and served. Appetizers came out right away followed by our main course. The restaurant was busy but the staff handle the crowd very well. We had ordered one meal and mentioned that we would split it and they went the extra step and split if for us. The food was great...a lot better than other Chili's I have been to.

I had the avocado burger which was absolutely delicious. Trying to eat healthier these days and if you take the time to actually read through the menu, finding something to eat is not hard.

I ordered the chips & salsa first before ordering so I could get something in my stomach. The salad comes, the meal comes and no chips! My father said his chili was horrible and sent it back. He never does this so it had to be awful. I waited 15 minutes before I ever got any food....They did still bring the chips but they were useless.  The booth we sat in was cut open and not clean.

We understand it's a busy time for the business lunch crowd, but when we put our order in we waited over 40 minutes to receive our food. The majority of the order was only salads, sandwiches, and an appetizer (which is easy to make). The manager already gave us our lunch for free for being so late, but on top of that, the food was cold and did not include any of our items that said on the menu. Also, before we even asked about our order, the waiter was ingoring us the whole time we were there. Not only did we wait forever, but I am also an hourly employee which when I was out for 1.5 hours!

I think they have that part down. This trip my fiancé and I got a table in the bar but decided on entrees. We ordered the two for 20 meal deal. Cheese sticks as apps that were decent but came with a tiny container of marinara. People, In with a grown man...one dip for him and its all gone. We ordered Parmesan crusted sirloins with broccoli and potatoes. The steak was cooked at the temp I requested although it was still a tiny brick. My potatoes were just blah. Could have never been hot since cheese didn't melt on them. The broccoli. Oh lord the broccoli. It was raw. I cook it at home so I know. So they sent it back and I actually saw him pop it in a microwave and it was still raw. They offered me ""French fries"" like I didn't already have terrible spuds on my plate. It wasn't our servers fault. He was nice. The kitchen on the other hand has to learn the art of steaming broccoli. The manager came out and apologized. Apology accepted.

The food tasted good but the presentation of my salad was on par with a fast food restaurant if not worse.  On a trio to the restroom we were almost run over by a dancing server and again on the return by a server slinging his dust rag in the air.  Our server disappeared after we got our food??  The kitchen floor was disgusting, service was avg and upon leaving we had to navigate around several tables that were pulled out from wall with dirty dustpans beside them (no server actively cleaning them).  Too expensive for this type of service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brentwood?start=20,2.536,2.536,2.536,2.536,2.536

10,Jennifer P.,"Nashville, TN",26,175,19.0,2.0,2016-08-24,"The service here has gone steadily downhill -- but it's not the servers... it's the manager who schedules them.   The poor servers are understaffed and overworked and they take the brunt of unhappy customers.  Based on the slow/cold food I think the kitchen is understaffed too.  If you are aiming for profit by short-changing your staff, you may find your customers desert you too.  Let me reiterate the SERVERS are excellent and try to do a good job.

I looked around for a server, but didn't see one.  Thankfully I was close enough to the little bar they keep the water pitchers at, so I was able to help myself.   After I had finished half of that glass of water, our waitress checked on us for the first time since taking our order.  At that time she refilled my husband's glass.  We did not see her again the rest of the time we were there.  I refilled my own glass again and had to hunt someone down to get a box for the food.  If it weren't for the little kiosk at the table, we probably never would have received the check.  I don't recommend going to this particular Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brentwood?start=20,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96

I rarely stray away from my typical order, which is the triple dipper. I ALWAYS get at least the southwestern egg rolls and boneless wings, and my third choice is sometimes random...usually between the spinach and artichoke dip or sliders. Another favorite of mine is the skillet queso and chips. Idk what it is about the southwestern egg rolls and skillet queso that keeps me coming back, but it's so good. Bottomless chips and salsa in the bar area is always a plus, too! I've never had too much of an issue with service, probably bc I come during slow hours (3pm-ish) and I sit in the bar area.

On the bright side, I did really enjoy the quesadilla explosion salad - the quesadilla, which I usually do not ever get one, had an extra sort of crispy / fried taste feel to it that let me know I was going to like this, but it was likely not even close to healthy, despite being served alongside a salad.  My wife really likes the shrimp tacos, too, which is one of her go-to dishes at Chili's.  I enjoyed the mango flavored tea, too!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brentwood,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84

We waited 8 minutes for a server (named Bree), which as a server I can say is not THAT bad but it is pretty noticeable. We order drinks and were asked immediately what we wanted for dinner instantly after she dropped of the drinks, not asking if we wanted appetizers. I ordered a margarita and an appetizer at the same time and I didn't get the drink until after we ordered dinner. Our dinner was dropped off by what looked like a manager. He filled up our drinks and we never saw our server or the manager for that matter for 10-15 more minutes. No one came and checked how our meal was or if we needed anything. Our server came back up and got us a Togo box and then seem bothered when we asked for dessert almost half walking away as we were. It took 17 minutes for dessert. Again, it's not busy. The food was mediocre. The cheese bites tasted like something from sonic and was cold. The queso tasted like slightly warmed spaghetti-o's. You know the kind.
