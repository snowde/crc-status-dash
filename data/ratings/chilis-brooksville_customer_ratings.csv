35,Shelley M.,"Zelienople, PA",17,4,,1.0,2015-03-29,We went to have dinner for the first time at this location last night around 6pm. They told us 30-45 min wait. We looked around and saw the dining room was a third empty. We walked across the parking lot and had a nice dinner at Bob Evans. 45 mins indeed.

15,John B.,"Brooksville, FL",56,84,11.0,1.0,2015-04-06,"CHILLED OUT on Chili's! We stopped into this brand spanking new Chili's in hopes of having a better experience than we've had at the one on Commercial Way in Spring Hill.  Our initial negative wave was noise! The first thing that hit us was a very HIGH ambient noise level. Lots of sparse and stark surfaces within a building causes sounds to bounce off the walls and ceilings and directly into your ears. Unfortunately today, a lot of establishments go for this 'clean' and 'modern' motif, with no curtains, upholstery or soft surfaces that tend to 'soak' up sound. In exchange for the clean and sterile look, you end up with sound waves inundating your ears from all directions.  Because of the high noise level we chose to sit at the bar, which was located separated a bit from the main dining area. We felt it would be doable. Sitting at the end of the bar, we were eventually noticed by the server/bar tender. My lovable and affable fiancée asked for a glass of Pinot Grigio. Not a huge or complicated order by any means. The server announced that they were 'out' of Pinot Grigio, and they had been out since Saturday. Really? Really? Lovable and affable looked at me, and I could see the hand-writing on the wall. Well, at least I could see it in her eyes. I knew this Chili's chow train was coming to a screeching halt, and quite abruptly.  So, based on the high noise level, and the restaurant being out of what most restaurateurs would consider a staple wine, we opted to depart the premises. We kindly advised the server we would be vacating our seats and without further ado, we walked out. Our first exposure to this Chili's has cemented what we had read and heard. They need to get their act together, control their inventory and consider another line of business. Perhaps something less food centered??? Or, wine centered?? Maybe they should consider selling EAR PLUGS!?? Now there's a thought! If you decide to give this Chili's a go, take your own wine, and a pair of ear plugs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brooksville,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003

Not only because it's new and clean but they have a very knowledgeable staff. We sat in the bar area at a table around dinner time on a weekday. Bartender Nick was attentive and after speaking with him we found he's been in this business a while and knows his stuff! We ordered the table side guacamole with his recommendation which was pretty good but we've had this before in Citywalk at a Mexican restaurant and it was excellent there so we were a little jaded.  I'm dieting so I ordered their steak from their light menu and it was filling and yummy as far as low cal foods go.  But my diet went out the window when we ended up ordering the brownie skillet. THAT was to die for. This would be on my last request menu. So good.  We will be back.

She said she called us and our table was ready. We were never ""called"". After being seated we were introduced to 2 servers who would be ""working  together"" to serve us. We had our drinks from the bar but we're not offered any water.  Our chips and guacamole came but we had no napkins or utensils.  We attempted to get our servers' attention several times as they walked by but were completely ignored.  My husband finally had to get up and request napkins and utensils from another server.  There was toilet paper all over the bathroom floor so I'm sure it had not been checked in a while as they were not very busy for a Friday evening.  Now I know why.  We will be driving the extra 15 miles the next time we want to go to Chili's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brooksville?start=20,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000005

16,Thomas T.,"Silver Beach, MI",5,135,176.0,1.0,2016-01-10,"First time here. I really like Mexican food. Surprisingly there are not very many Mexican restaurants around this area, so I thought Chili's Tex-Mex might be a good substitute. WRONG! I walk in and this place was VERY LOUD, NOISEY! I sit down and the waitress wants my drink order in 5 seconds, as I hem and haw she just says ""I'll bring you some water to start"". Fine. She brings the water, with a slice of lemon floating in it- WHICH I HATE! As I am looking at the glass deciding whether or not to ask for another glass of CLEAN water, I notice another piece of food down towards the bottom on the INSIDE of the glass. It looked like a bean skin! ICK! As I pointed to it, the waitress also noticed and she apologized and said she would bring another right away, I ordered a Coke as well and she said she would bring me chips and salsa (usual and complimentary or included with the price, whichever way you want to look at it). I ordered the Smoked Chicken Quesadilla and started in on the chips and salsa. The salsa was a little weak, but O.K. I squeezed some limes into it as I usually do with any salsa and I stirred it with my fork. A BIG, NASTY piece of SKIN came up on my fork and I was quite disgusted. It wasn't actually skin- it was an old, soggy chip that some how ended-up in my salsa!  I asked for the manager and he told me ""Yeh, that happens sometimes, we keep the chips right next to the salsa and sometimes they fall in"". He offered to bring me new salsa, but as I thought about his answer it didn't make sense to me. Either you don't store your salsa in a refrigerator (which would be stupid AND dangerous!) or you keep your tortilla chips in the refrigerator, which would be VERY stupid! How else could chips accidentally fall into the salsa sometimes??? When my quesadilla came out I opted for dipping the cut pieces in my salsa rather than the white jalapeno sauce that came with the entrée, good thing too! Just as I was about to try the jalapeno sauce I noticed A LONG, NASTY BLACK HAIR IN THE SAUCE!!! WTF???! I have very short hair (maybe 3/4 of an inch), there is no way this was mine! I asked for the manager again. This time when he came out I was becoming quite annoyed. The table next to me heard the story. He apologized and said he personally would re-make my food in about 5 minutes and bring it out to me. He brought my quesadilla out and said he would comp my meal. I ate about half of my food, but I really wasn't all that hungry anymore.  - Dirty water glass. - Soggy, old chip that looks like skin in my salsa. - Hair in my quesadilla sauce. = Loss of appetite. I really expected better from a national chain like Chili's, guess I was wrong.(see photos) ***********UPDATE  01/19/2016*********************** I sent the above to Chili's Corp. over a week ago. I received no response, I guess Chili's doesn't care about it's customers! ***********UPDATED UPDATE************************ A few days after the above update, the Chili's manager did finally contact me and sent a gift card. I used it at the Chili's on HWY 19, Springhill- the food and the service were much better!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brooksville,,,,,

19,Jacki S.,"Hazleton, PA",7,9,4.0,2.0,2017-04-02,"I'm not quite sure if my review will help as I see other have had similar experiences at this particular chili's. I had a bad time the second I walked in the door. My husband and daughter and I were driving around looking for somewhere to eat. And we came across this location. We have been frequenting another location as it is absolutely perfect and decided it's got to be as good as the other right? NO! As soon as I walked in I almost fell on my rear the floor thru out the entire restaurant mind you was like a skating rink. It was like someone mopped the floor with grease. Yet as a whole it seemed clean so I have no idea what that was all about. Our server I believe his name was zach was the only plus in my entire time there. He was sweet pleasant and definitely over worked yet still had a smile on his face. That man deserves a raise. It was a bunch of little things that added up to a bad experience and some were out of chili's hands but they didn't help. We got seated quickly and as it was a Saturday night at around 8, I was pleasantly surprised. The pleasant disappeared rather quickly. It was as loud as a freight train in there! No thanks to the pregnant woman giving birth on the floor right next our table. Obviously it took time to get our food not really complaining as it was expected since we went when we did. But the food was not good just a touch above edible. My daughter had the mac n cheese and it looked old. My husband and I got steak. He ordered his medium with fries and I got mine well done with mashed potatoes and broccoli. They somehow switched our steak preference and he got well done as I was stuck with medium. That turned me off but as I was helping my daughter and my husband was almost finished by the time I got to mine I was stuck with it. It rolled my stomach to eat yet I did so anyway since I'm paying quite a bit for it! It was all hot when it was delivered yet potatoes looked old. The steak was so chewy which surprised me as it was still pink. From my understanding it gets chewy when it's over cooked so I have no idea. It was altogether an unpleasant experience. From the greasy floor, no toilet paper or paper towels in the bathroom and food that was expensive and not worth it. I will be making sure I go to the other location from now on.

6,Desirea B.,"Tampa, FL",0,6,4.0,3.0,2017-11-13,"I'm only giving three stars because the food was good. The waitress was slow, made us wait while she tended to other tasks that were given after mine. She gave us our drinks told us she would be ""right back"" with our straws but didn't return till 6 minuets later. (Why not grab the straws before bringing the drinks?) also had to wait for sauce over 10 minuets. While I tried to remind her she replied with ""I still have to put the request in for them. I'll be right back"" once again.. (why didn't you do that while you put in the order for our pickles?) after we ate our food, we asked for the ""lava cake"" dessert and she brought us a small one for both of us to share but charged us for a big one. Thankfully we noticed the mistake and had her correct it. Our whole bill was over $55.00. I think we should have had better for what we paid. But at least the food was decently good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brooksville,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24

0,Missy P.,"Watertown, MA",10,95,19.0,5.0,2017-12-23,"Clutch your farm-raised, sustainable pearls folks! MY BLACK BEAN BURGER WAS NOT AS HOT AS I'd have liked! So, because I'm insufferable, I sent it back, screaming at the waitress, as she clearly did not regard my need for a formed bean patty with the seriousness this requires.  I'm kidding. Ever have one of those moments that you realize  you've become everyone you hate? I just had one of those moments, thumbing through my own yelp reviews.  I went to Chili's and it was goddamn great. My server, Marcy, was sharp as a tack and funny and charming. The food was perfectly fine and I caught a quick buzz off the happy hour drafts. When I asked for a hotter black bean burger Marcy and the manager were wonderful. They both handled it with grace, they didn't make things awkward and they're both damn good at their jobs.  The restaurant and restrooms were clean and everyone was cheerful. I'd go back and ask to sit in her section in a heartbeat! *it is gonna be 2018 in a few short days and the world feels pretty miserable. I'm goddamn done contributing to that. 2018 is the year of no negative Yelp reviews!  BE THE CHANGE YOU WANT TO SEE IN THE YELP!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brooksville,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36
3,Amy M.,"Sanford, Orlando, FL",0,47,1.0,4.0,2018-01-06,"I called in my order and asked for no green onions. When I arrived at the location I was promptly greeted. My food was brought out just as I said my name. The guy opened it up and said ""I double checked there's no green onions"". As I was walking towards the door a guy from the kitchen staff came and opened the door for me and said ""thank you for choosing Chili's tonight, drive safe and keep warm!"" Got home the food is delicious and I'm still smiling from the interaction. Was it anything crazy or above and beyond? No. But in a world where customer service seems to be a huge lack it was just really nice to be thanked for choosing them and showing a genuine concern for my safety. Thank you Chili's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-brooksville,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
