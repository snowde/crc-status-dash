34,Braxton G.,"Fort Worth, TX",3,12,,4.0,2012-06-16,Only had bad service once here. The servers are far above most. Quick and friendly. Its a chain restaurant so don't expect something original and amazing. I go here almost every Wednesday night and its always an enjoyable time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-burleson-3?start=20,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997
26,Shelly R.,"Fort Worth, TX",79,37,49.0,4.0,2012-11-28,Good food. This day we went the whole staff was running around like they were confused as hell.  Sometimes Ive waited too long to  be seated-even when its slow. This past time I went there was a supervisor ?  named Stephanie who was absolutley helpful and attentive!  Great service from her while our waitress was  busy. That chocolate lava cake thing is a must DO!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-burleson-3?start=20,2.512,2.512,2.512,2.512,2.5120000000000005
31,Claudia J.,"Burleson, TX",96,38,1.0,4.0,2013-08-01,"I frequent this location since it's close to my house and the staff are always friendly. The past few times I've gone the service has been slow, even when then restaurant isn't packed, but that can be attributed to numerous things. My favorite item on their menu is the chicken enchilada soup. I'm not a soup person by any means but this one is mouth watering good. So good that I purposely choose not to look at the calorie content! It's also a great place to have a margarita...or two.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-burleson-3?start=20,2.416,2.416,2.416,2.416,2.416

25,Jack H.,"Fort Worth, TX",82,75,248.0,1.0,2014-08-09,"Yep. Typical chain restaurant. We've all been to chilis. And most likely all left feeling the same way. Wondering why we even bother. The service was good, except they have the new tablet things at the table , you can search the menu, re order drinks and pay. That can't be good for a waiters career. I had the sirloin steak, which tasted similar to the meat at a fast food restaurant . My wife had the half rack of ribs, flavor was there but the meat wasn't. If you want to suck on bones, please go to chilis. It was also served on a broken plate. But we did 2 for $20. How much do you expect?  The Long Island iced tea tasted a lot like lemonade but was strong. It's mediocre food. We went with family so it wasn't our choice. Next time, we decide!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-burleson-3?start=20,2.02,2.02,2.02,2.02,2.02
33,Devin C.,"Denton, TX",0,8,,4.0,2014-12-26,"My girlfriend, her parents, and I decided to meet up at Chili's for some dinner. We all decided to split into couples and have two $20 for 2 combos. The combo lets two people share an appetizer, along with a entree each all for 20 dollars! They also had a $35 combo that included two margaritas and a desert on top of the rest, but we didn't think we could eat a whole dessert so we went with the first. For appetizers the parents got chips and guacamole, and we got the onion rings which we all shared. The guacamole is to die for, and I could eat the appetizers all day! The parents both got a 6oz steak with fries, which they both enjoyed. I I thought they looked a bit on the small side, but they were full afterwards. My girlfriend got the original chicken crispers which were basically just chicken nugget/strips with a side of corn on the cob and fries, and I thought they were pretty average tasting. I got a bacon burger with fries, and I was so blown away by the taste!!! I always get the bacon burger, and I guarantee no disappointment. I thought that the waiter was nice, but she could have shown a bit more interest in our table. I also noticed while walking back from the bathroom that the kitchen looked a bit messy, but obviously that doesn't effect the fresh food at all. Looking at the dinner as a whole I thought it was pretty great, and I think Chili's  is my favorite restaurant to eat at!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-burleson-3?start=20,2.32,2.32,2.32,2.32,2.32
32,Darla S.,"Burleson, TX",0,85,106.0,4.0,2015-01-04,"We always enjoy Chilis. It's a nice family atmosphere. Today's experience was no exception. Tyler our server did a fantastic job, especially for having a large group to attend to. However, as a mom, and there were several of us moms at the same table, the Ziosks pose quite a problem. If kids can create extra items on the bills then they should only be brought to the table when it's time to pay. also by just bringing the Z's at the end of the meal would eliminate the need to struggle to keep all the kids from messing with them during the meal thus for making moms jobs that much more difficult.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-burleson-3?start=20,2.2239999999999998,2.2239999999999998,2.2239999999999998,2.2239999999999998,2.2239999999999998
30,Don H.,"Burleson, TX",28,1,2.0,2.0,2015-03-15,"I know most restaurant are usually staffed by teenage waiters but your usually expect a few ""grown up"" managers to keep things in line. The food here is ok, sometimes even good but consistently horrible service. Don't even think about take out...last time, they said online to pull in to the take out space and they'd bring the food out. I waited 15 minutes and finally walked in. There was some teenage waitress using the whole take out counter to count her tips, when I walked up she acted like I was intruding in the breakroom. Another 5 minutes and someone noticed me...my food had been sitting there ready the whole time, they had seen me sitting in my car. It was just lazy with now aver to be seen to crack the whip.

28,Coni V.,"Crowley, TX",0,8,,1.0,2015-03-28,Used to be our favorite place to go. They've redone their menu and the choices are not as good. One member of the wait staff is a young man with a large belt buckle. He is slow and has a hard time taking care of his section. I would avoid Chili's now. It hurts my heart to give them a thumbs down.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-burleson-3?start=20,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000005
24,Robert K.,"Burleson, TX",0,17,8.0,1.0,2015-05-01,Absolutely the worst place to eat in Burleson . We ate on a Thursday the food took forever. My wife ordered fajitas and they didn't bring her tortillas. Drinks were only refilled when asked  I spoke with manager asked her for corporate number and her name (MOD) She apologized about our service and said it was unacceptable she then looked at me and asked if I still wanted the number HORRIBLE DO NOT GO,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-burleson-3?start=20,1.956,1.956,1.956,1.956,1.956

My waiter must have been slow she acted like she couldn't  comprehend our orders or was her mind some where else? So here's the fun part the manager came over ""not our waitress Houdini"" to apologize for how long our food was taking he also proceeded to tell us if we want desert it's in him. Reall, moving on 5 mins later everyone's food came out but mine I don't know if they had to run to HEB and purchase some pre cooked fajitas , I say that because  10 mins later when my food arrived that's what it taste like.

18,Wes L.,"Fort Worth, TX",131,111,234.0,3.0,2015-12-22,I like chili's alright. It's decent food for cheap. This location is kept clean with pleasant servers. It can also get you lunch within an hour if you've only got an hour to eat. We work 10 min away and come in and get out quick. I've tried quite a bit on the menu and I can't complain too much about the food. It's not too quality but I'm sure you already knew that coming to chili's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-burleson-3,,,,,
21,Kristin W.,"Mansfield, TX",15,26,2.0,5.0,2016-03-26,I ordered online and picked up at the ToGo door. Food was ready even sooner than predicted and very tasty. I had the old timer with broccoli instead of fries. My boyfriend said the carnitas burrito with black beans hit the spot. The fried pickles are my favorite appetizer and we topped it off with a chocolate molten lava cake. I don't know about the dine in at this location but the ToGo process was easy and good!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-burleson-3?start=20,,,,,
23,Kara-Lee W.,"Godley, TX",1,10,,1.0,2016-04-07,Was just ate at this location and sat in the bar area.  Had only received our chips and drinks when a woman at the bar fell over into the floor and hit her head on the step up to our booth.  She got up and was obviously drunk.  The bar had blatantly over served and didn't care.   When I asked our server if they were going to call them a cab and stated that she was clearly over served our server got an attitude.  He did not care that she was too drunk to drive. I will not give money to a restaurant that is reckless with their alcohol license just to make money.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-burleson-3?start=20,,,,,

I paid extra to have my steak turned to a 10oz from the 6 but it looked no bigger than the 6oz at all. The steak was cooked too long and was tough. My whole family left still hungry. I didn't know till i got the bill the ""table entertainment"" (i can only guess was the 2min or less we spent checking out the tablet thing on the table) was a $2 charge. Could hardly ever get waiters attention. That was probably our last trip. It's changed... & not for the better :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-burleson-3?start=20,,,,,

I had one beer and the gentleman I met with had 4 expensive drinks. I ended up having to leave for something and I asked for the check (My) Check with one beer. When I got my check he gave me the wrong one and had put all but one of his drinks on mine. I didn't want to cause a scene or seem cheap so I just paid it but it pissed me off all night that he didn't pay attention to what he was doing and I had to pay for what wasn't mine. I will never go to this location again and or order for my employees through out the week like I usually do.

It is something about the menagerie of food items and the flavoring they add to everything to make their food unique. To be fair I typically don't enjoy Applebee's and TGI Fridays either - so it is not just Chilis.  However, Saturday at this location I had a really positive experience. I ordered the child's plate of sliders with asparagus and a half sweet, half unsweet tea. The meal was tasty and just the right amount. Had I ordered the regular meal size with 4 sliders the greasy experience would have been overpowering. But with 2 and the asparagus it was perfect.
