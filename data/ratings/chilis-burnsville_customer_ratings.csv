14,DZ A.,"San Francisco, CA",26,150,61.0,3.0,2012-01-22,"It's a Chili's what can I say. Friday nights service is slow and you could have to wait 45 minutes for a table.  Finding a spot in the lot is very challenging.  Last time we ate there, our food was cold. Queso dip was so cool, 2 1/2 year old dough right in. The two can eat for $35 is a good deal, app, two entree, two margaritas and dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-burnsville,,,,,
13,Chimeren P.,"London, United Kingdom",80,194,358.0,3.0,2012-02-21,"Well it's a chain..yes but at least with a chain you know what to expect. We've come here a few times with large groups after a day of go-kart racing.  When I made reservations we had no wait.  Last time I didn't and we did have to wait awhile but we had about 15 people so totally understandable. I never remember what I ordered here as it's always that forgettable. But they do offer low calorie options so I'm positive it was something low cal with chicken. The main reason we come here is my BF loves the memphis dry rub ribs. He always gets the full rack and can never finish them. Bonus leftovers for lunch.   Service is always good and we've never had trouble with the parking.  No complaints, I'm sure we'll be back here again next time we are in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-burnsville,,,,,
16,A L C.,"Post Falls, ID",11,118,5.0,4.0,2012-08-22,"Kids, Husband & I ate there twice on vacation.  Table top IPAD things are ingenious, as are the 2 for 1 margaritas during happy hour & the kids eat free on Tuesday promotion.  $35 for 4 with booze & dessert on Tuesday night!  Split the pick 3 appetizer platter both times.  Watched the game.  Kids were plugged into games on table computer.  Servers were awesome.  Great date night :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-burnsville,,,,,
12,B H.,"Washington, DC",0,37,,1.0,2013-08-09,"I have low expectations at large chains but this was a convenient place to meet up.    There was nothing redeeming about the meal.  The guacomole on the guacomole burger was disgusting mush, the burger was way over cooked, fries were soggy.  My friend ordered the chicken fajita... the chicken was not edible. Just shockingly bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-burnsville,,,,,
10,Chris K.,"Burnsville, MN",166,8,3.0,5.0,2013-10-04,"This particular Chili's really stands out above the rest because they give free meals to anyone who is homeless every Thursday!  Tell all your homeless friends, free meals at this Chili's every Thursday. Good on you Chili's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-burnsville,,,,,
17,Jose D.,"Savage, MN",4,12,,3.0,2014-01-02,"DO NOT even try to get out once they lock the door even if you try to warm up your car in the middle of the winter for your family. If the service crew is too young, do not take the risk. No common sense.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-burnsville,,,,,
11,Lola T.,"Broomfield, CO",0,26,3.0,1.0,2014-01-18,"Do not go there!!! I would rather eat fast food then eat at this restaurant again. The food was mediocre as best, the staff had no clue what they are doing, and it took forever to get our orders in half empty restaurant. I am not even sure they deserve any stars... if I could I would give them ZERO. Stay away!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-burnsville,,,,,

6,Kelly S.,"Burnsville, MN",34,8,3.0,4.0,2016-02-06,I recommend any tex mex dish with prime rib. It's so tender it's like butter. I had the mix and match fajitas with prime rib and chicken. The chicken was less to be desired but the prime rib made up for it. They also gave me a lot more of the prime rib than chicken. :D,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-burnsville,,,,,
9,Trevor K.,"Burnsville, MN",0,66,20.0,1.0,2016-05-19,We used to absolutely love this place. The food is great but the staff is just rude. When we talking to the management they are of course very apologetic but then we come back and the same thing happens again and again. If you go just order take out.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-burnsville,,,,,
8,Crown Heights B.,"Maple Grove, MN",25,26,10.0,2.0,2016-09-04,"OMG! Just ordered the Cajun Chicken Pasta Togo and it was horrible, chicken was dry and pasta was way over cooked. The only reason why I'm giving it two stars instead of one is because the customer service was great! This was a waste of $15.00, Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-burnsville,,,,,
7,Rebecca V.,"Mentone, CA",0,12,,3.0,2016-10-06,"The last two times I have ordered take-out has been a disaster.  The first time I went and picked up my order, drove all the way home (Lakeville) to open my food box and my order was completely wrong.  I did call the restaurant and they comped my meal, and I said I would come back for the correct order, which I received and was given $10 in chili's bucks.    This satisfied me for my inconvenience.  However, the last time I placed a take-out order, I placed in online, got a confirmation email, and I sent my husband to pick up.  He then called to say they have no record of my order and that I must have ordered at the wrong Chilis.  I had to send a text picture of the email to my husband to show the staff.  They made the order and again comped the meal.  Although, my husband was less pleased he had to wait around for My food on his way home from work.   Comping the meals is fine the first time, but the takeout screw-ups are becoming a lot more frustrating and inconvenient than comping a meal while sitting around another 20 min to get food togo defeating the purpose to takeout to begin with.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-burnsville,,,,,
5,Patrick C.,"Minneapolis, MN",4,207,,5.0,2017-01-21,"Good Chili's location. I've been here a few times, and I've always left happy. They take my coupons without fuss, and I love, love, love that I can pay and even order food from their POS interactive device on the table. Who needs to wait around for the check? Not me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-burnsville,,,,,
2,Daniel L.,"San Francisco, CA",44,47,341.0,3.0,2017-02-26,"I was lucky enough to stop by this place for the 10 dollar 3 course meal. I just felt so happy by how much food they give you. I had the salad, half rack of ribs + sides, and last but not least their chocolate lava cake. Don't get me wrong, this was a still a chain restaurant where they do everything the same and nothing particularly stands out. But, for that price and quality time we get to spend with friends I say it's worth stopping by once in a while. Oh by the way, I haven't been to Chili's a while and they have tablets on their tables now! Be careful though, they do charge you a price for playing with it. We kept outscoring everyone on those Trivia games, just look for the highest score. Anyhow, Chili's, it is what it is: mediocre place you go once in a while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-burnsville,,,,,
4,Todd E.,"San Diego, CA",17,2,1.0,5.0,2017-07-06,"I absolutely love this Chilis, they have 2 for ones all day and you can't get a cheaper lunch at a McDonald's. The food is always consistently great no matter which Chilis you choose. The manager Mike was awesome and keeps the place running smoothly. The bartenders are freindly and are always prompt with drinks and food. I have made this my ""go to"" place for lunch! YUMMY",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-burnsville,,,,,
1,Kathleen K.,"Farmington, MN",24,293,5.0,2.0,2017-09-24,"We visited Chili's on a slow night. The service was good but the food was below average. The Oldtimer burger was overcooked and dry. The Caribbean Salad was better years ago with the original recipe. Now it is too much lettuce and not enough flavor. You can do much better in this area. Caribbean Salad with Grilled Chicken Pineapple, mandarin oranges, dried cranberries, red bell peppers, green onions, cilantro, sesame seeds with honey-lime dressing. Oldtimer Burger with cheese",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-burnsville,,,,,
3,Steve H.,"Burnsville, MN",41,1,,5.0,2017-10-27,I really love this Chili's. I have always had good service. We typically eat there 3-4 times a month as it is an easy meal for the family. And you can't go wrong with the two for ones...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-burnsville,,,,,
