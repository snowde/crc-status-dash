4,Alberto R.,"Aguas Buenas, Puerto Rico",26,56,49,5.0,2012-02-08,"We have been to Chili's on a number of occasions for the varied food fare that has never disappointed us.  This time, the unplanned excuse was Tuesday's happy hour, conveniently from 4 to 7 pm for those of us that want to beat the late drunk drivers. Drinks are 2 for 1 as long as they contain alcohol (why else would you be there) and includes all their fancy fare including the Mojito and the Margarita Presidente that we had.  Drinks are a good size made with brand components and the barman's service was attentive and quick. You have many choices of finger food to eat at the bar and we chose a Triple Play platter that included excellent Buffalo Wings (be sure to order the ""Hot"" version).  Extra points are awarded for free Wi-Fi and TV monitors. This promo may not last forever, so put it in your tickler soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-caguas,,,,,

0,Randall B.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",19,14,14,5.0,2013-11-24,This Cjilis knows how to take care of you. sit at the bar for great service. there is a movie theater beside Chili's if you let your partner know you need to go fast because of the movies they seem to step it up and you get in and out in no time. Hint... do not order a well done steak or burger though. for the cooking time I mean. food drink and service of the bar outstanding. I have sat at the tables service is mediocre at best. and they seem to get the food wrong.  whoever trains the bar staff should maybe train the wait staff. P.S. Julio at the bar...GREAT,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-caguas,,,,,
3,Armando E.,"Cayey, Puerto Rico",1,1,1,3.0,2015-02-28,"Didn't have the best experience. I went there yesterday for lunch and sit at the bar. NO ONE came to take our order. After waiting for like 15 minutes a bartender finally came to take care of us. We ordered some drinks and it took them 15 more minutes for the drinks to arrive. The place wasn't crowded, I believe it was more about laziness. The drinks were awesome though. We asked for a few minutes in order to think about the food. Those minutes were equal to half an hour for them. We waited half an hour for them to come back and ask us for our order. Honestly I don't know what happened, but the service was horrible. Too bad to leave $0 tip, because food was amazing also.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-caguas,,,,,
2,Shary A.,"Kansas City, MO",176,219,1118,3.0,2015-03-30,I came here only once with my boyfriend to meet up with my best friend and a colleague for the tuesday 2-for-1 drinks special from 4-7pm. We sat at the bar area and received good service. The food was your standard Chili's food and was served fairly fast. I would probably come to this chilis again if i had plans to meet up with my friends from that area.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-caguas,,,,,
1,Ruth S.,"Tomás de Castro, Puerto Rico",1,35,2,4.0,2015-11-14,Best dishes are the appetizers.  That being said they're so good that I always end up going when I'm in Catalinas Mall.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-caguas,,,,,
