4,Barry G.,"Ridgeway, SC",3,21,2.0,2.0,2013-12-08,"The only thing I've had here that is consistently good are the ribs.  I'm frankly disappointed in this Chili's and feel they could do so much better.  Sorry Chili's, I can't recommend you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-camden,,,,,
2,Ginger M.,"Ridgeway, SC",49,35,49.0,4.0,2016-01-31,"Chili's in Lugoff...we almost always sit at the bar and have Always received great service. This one is convienently located in front of Walmart and let me tell you, sometimes you need a margarita before shopping at Walmart! The ""House"" margarita is the ""$3.50 All day, Every day"" and it is a bit on the sour side but I like it. The food has been good and consistent each visit with lots of choices. A good chain restaurant!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-camden,,,,,
3,Brittany M.,"Lugoff, SC",0,3,,2.0,2016-09-14,"I love Chili's (actually worked at Chili's in Cola. at one point) but this past time was just bad. The food was great- as always- but the service--NO! It was a Friday night and pretty busy. Our server (Nicole? I think?) forgot to put in our appetizer. She didn't write anything down. She made excuses that ""someone took them"" but we knew what was up-- I ordered my daughter's mashed potatoes PLAIN (9 months old) and she brought them with their white gravy (pretty heavily peppered--not baby friendly). She couldn't manage to remember my cousin's tea was sweet. She sat down hot food plates right in front of my baby on two occasions. BIG NO. She had three other tables besides me and complained out loud when she got sat again. Both my cousin and I placed to-go order that she did not write down and had to return to the table twice to ask what we had ordered. The manager never visited the table at all. We both got chipotle fingers for our meals and ordered ribs to go. We got the southwest eggrolls as our app (that came after the entree). I had the Patron margarita. Everything tasted great!! For me, dining out is more about the service and positive experience than the food--I can order take-out for a lot less. Funny thing is there was a table of two guys (father and son) that she was happily waiting on while overlooking us (and we tip BIG when the service is right)--so her loss. I'll make sure to go on a less busy night next time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-camden,,,,,
1,Nancy M.,"Coconut Creek, FL",1143,607,3214.0,3.0,2017-09-14,"Chloe too excellent care of our party last night. There was three of us, me, my ex and my dad. We arrived around 630 and happy hour was until 7 so I had two margaritas. Monday's at Chili's they offered 4 dollars off fajitas so you know we had to order them. My only complaint was the chipotle butter drowned the steak slices. It was almost soupy so I didn't enjoy mine all that much. I like a dryer grilled with seasoning steak this was the opposite of that.  Dad had a half rack of baby back ribs which he devoured. Chili's is a franchise but I've eaten in so many of them this was the first time they were drowned in that chipotle butter.  My ex jeff had the combo fajitas  and he ate every drop of his.  It's a typical chili's just like every other one in the United States. Clean, goid deals and prices and a hot meal. I liked it. No real complaints except that soupy chipotle butter I could have done without..kinda ruined my meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-camden,,,,,
0,Lynn T.,"Fayetteville, GA",0,18,28.0,3.0,2017-10-08,"We were seated right away. It was not crowded at all. The waitperson was very sweet almost to the point of being timid. We ordered black bean burgers that were quite tasty. Our burgers were a special order and apparently it is better to stick to the menu. The you lady specifically doubled check to make sure my didn't want cheese. However the burger still came out with cheese. The burger were also void of sated onions. Go figure! Any how,  I don't blame her she did put it in correctly. She apologize numerous times. I did like the way the friendly staff helped each other out and worked as a team! Kudos for Chili's trainers and staff. They are the only reason I would go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-camden,,,,,
