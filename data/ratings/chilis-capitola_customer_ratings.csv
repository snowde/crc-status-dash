74,Jessica C.,"Santa Cruz, CA",83,10,1.0,3.0,2012-03-15,My friend suggested we go here and my first thought was-what am I going to eat? So I looked at the menu and saw nachos. I was kind of bracing myself for a mediocre plate of nachos so I set my expectations a bit low. I ordered the regular nachos without meat and it was pretty satisfying for nachos. The cheese wasn't as hot as I would like it but the guacamole made up for it because it was nothing short of delicious. I also had a mango margarita with salt on the rim which was surprisingly a good combo. The salt was not on the rim the last one I ordered one. So this was all in all a good lunch.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-capitola?start=100,3.08,3.08,3.08,2.476,3.0800000000000005
174,April S.,"Watsonville, CA",1,6,,2.0,2012-03-19,"Great place to go when you literally have all day....service is VERY slow, even when there are only a couple tables being served.  I've gone a couple times on my lunch and always get back late (even after letting them know I'm short on time because I'm on lunch). Last time I was there I had 40 minutes for lunch and the place was empty, only 2 other tables being served and all I ordered was an appetizer which took about 20-25 minutes to get to me and by that time the fries and cheese were almost cold so must have been sitting there for a while before my waitress bothered to bring it out to me, then I asked for a side of jalapenos and as I waited I watched my waitress go to her other 2 tables and pick up plates and come in and out of the kitchen WITHOUT my jalapens...finally when she walked past my table I asked her again for my jalapenos and she had totally forgot about me asking for them the first time!!! I'd be a little more understanding if it was crazy busy but I mean, COME ON!!

Let me take this opportunity to tell you, its not just me.

92,Gene K.,"San Jose, CA",12,26,3.0,4.0,2012-10-20,"My wife and I went in on during dinner time on a Saturday night. Sure enough, it was pretty crowded. But the wait was only 15 minutes, or so the hostess said. I don't know because when it gets busy like that, we just go to the bar area and grab ourselves a seat You are served just the same as the regular dining area with even the same menu. However the hostess made a mistake in telling us that it was happy hour. We found out after our bill arrived that she was in fact mistaken since happy hours aren't on Saturdays. The ambiance was typical loud on a Saturday night. I ordered the half rack of ribs and the salmon filet. To my surprise, the salmon was seasoned just right, and was cooked well too, not dry at all.  My wife had the mushroom burger, and she really enjoyed her burger. She said it was juicy and flavorful and quite hearty. You can't ask for much more from a chain restaurant. Our server was attentive, and got us drinks and appetizer fast. All in all, an enjoyable dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-capitola?start=60,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.384,3.2000000000000006

I sat five feet away from my drinks for well over ten minutes, our waiter Shane walked right by four or five times looked at the drinks and us and kept going. I ended up asking another water who had to go find Shane to hand us our drink. After twenty minutes he finally asked us for our food order. Never asked us if we needed another drink, I finally flagged him down and ordered another round, but asked for them quickly. The bartender had them up after about five minutes, it took Shane another ten after that to bring 'em to our table. I got another waiters attention because Shane was too busy, to get a mangier. After explaining to the mangier, he said sorry and offered nothing to make our visit worth the waiting. After talking to the mangier it took another ten minutes to find Shane and get our bill, after we had been done eating for fifteen minutes or more. I walked into the mall with my 16month old son while my boyfriend paid. Shane made sure to say sorry to my boyfriend and said ""Sorry the bartenders are really shitty"".

I find this Chilis to be the best location I have eaten at. The food and service are generally very good. It's a small location attached to the Capitola mall so that can be a pain for both seating and parking.  This last time we went we had a larger than normal party. Our waiter Shane rose to the challenge. He brought extra plates, and everything we might need for a family with quite a few kids. He was friendly and quick and we appreciated his efficiencies.  Minus two stars because:  Our kids meals all came out WAY before the adult meals. Our kids were finished eating, and we found ourselves quickly scarfing down ours as the kids grew more and more impatient.  Minus another star because my chicken wings were so breaded you couldn't find meat and I ended up sending them back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-capitola?start=80,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.252,3.1600000000000006
110,jeff m.,"Santa Cruz, CA",3,32,,2.0,2013-01-23,"Went to lunch there today 01-23-13. Taking the wife to lunch as we were doing errands. I suggested Chili's because of all the times I've gone to them. From Carmel to San Francisco, they've always been good. The Chili's at 1855 41st Ave, Capitola, is not one of those aforementioned Cili's I've experienced. As a fact, this restaurant experience was one of the worst ones ever! The service is good, I guess?  When we ordered our drinks, the coffee the wife ordered was served in a dirty cup. When unwrapping the napkin that held the silverware for my place, it was dirty. Of course the server brought us clean utensils & coffee served in a clean cup; should have walked out then? When we got our orders; the combos with soup an sandwich; the soup was cold. We asked the server to warm it up & when she came back, it was still cold. The next time an individual came out, it was the manager. She brought our soups heated to the degree that we were happy with, but had added bacon that we didn't want or ask for. At this point we just held back & removed the bacon.  The grilled sandwiches were good; cooked good. The back chatter of the supervisor critiquing the host, didn't make up for the fact that the building was cold. The waitperson did offer to give us dessert; whoopee. My wife kept talking to the person in her friendly consoling tone, which I admit was getting to me. I just wanted out of there & at that point, I know these people don't have a clue & I will never go back there.    It soured the rest of the day. I think headquarters needs to come to that particular restaurant & pave the policy for them, because if it has to rely on its own for conducting business, they'll lose. I've lived in the area since 1965 & the restaurants that I've gone to that were in that poor of operation, are only memories, that I couldn't tell you the name of. In the business reputation of Chili's, it might not be a bad thing that it close & people forget it ever existed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-capitola?start=80,3.08,3.08,3.08,2.12,3.0800000000000005

There is nothing bad about the food, the food actually looked interesting and good to me when we looked at the menu. Ok, let's get started. We were sitting by our waitor and soon asked if we could order anything. We said we needed more time and he left. Then we looked at the menu over and over again and even carefully read the description of each item for over 10 minutes, the waitor didn't show up.

169,Amber B.,"Santa Cruz, CA",101,26,13.0,2.0,2014-02-16,"I went here with some friends about a month ago and was very disappointed. We waited for about five minutes just for a hostess to show up even though the restaurant wasn't that busy. Upon being seated, I ordered the bacon ranch quesadilla as per usual and was brought out the completely wrong quesadilla that I did not order. When I informed the server of the mistake, she said she would gladly take care of it. However, she came back with which I believed to be the same exact quesadilla. The only difference was that bacon bits seemed to have been just thrown onto the quesadilla in a futile attempt to disguise the fact that this was the same quesadilla from before. In addition, our waitress was not attentive and came back with requests for more ranch and napkins after we had already finished our meal. I'm not sure if it was because she seemed to have a lot of other tables at the time, but I don't believe that is any excuse to provide poor service to guests. She tried to make up for this by being extremely friendly when she was paying attention to us, which one of my friends then reminded me that we had ""come to eat, not to be her friend"". Wise words. Also, I  visited this location last summer with my family and the hostess sat us in a closed section without informing a server, causing us to wait for about fifteen minutes before any one approached us. I probably will not be visiting this location again. I believe that management needs to do a better job in training their employees on the basics of communication, hospitality, and service. I think they have done an extremely less than adequate job when it comes down to running an efficient restaurant and hopefully changes can be made for future improvement.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-capitola?start=120,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.216,2.44

The other night my parents and I went, we had one appetizer and three meals, three sodas, and it was almost $70! This would have normally cost us about 45 to 50, but they nickel and dimed us for every side and double charged for the chips and salsa. They have these new computer at the table where you can order drinks and appetizers, and play games for $1. The problem is that even if you accidently press a button it charges you.

Called in at 6pm, said they had some open tables for a family of four.  Arrived and no hostess by the entrance for a good 5 minutes. Finally got seated by a waitress who cares enough to explain the new ziosk technology they have - it's like a mini screen on every table that customers can use to refill/re-order their drinks, pay their bills, etc... Our waiter Isaac came by to let us know he'll be with us in a few minutes (polite of him to communicate despite how busy he was).  By the time he got to us, he promptly took our orders and kept checking back on us frequently (almost every time he passed by our table on his way to other people's).  He'd come to check up on our drinks, refills on appetizer chips, and if we needed anything at all. The line by the door got longer & the restaurant was getting busier but Isaac stayed on top of his customers and was always attentive & kind-mannered. The other waitresses next to our table were very pleasant and patient too. The food was amazing despite the franchise. We got the 2 for $20. The original BBQ baby back ribs were moist & well-seasoned. Hubby had the chicken fajitas and loved the grilled white meat and mini salad bar rack that it came with. This restaurant is quite kid & family-friendly. They had tons of crayon kits for the kids, ziosk had $0.99 game apps to keep anyone entertained, TV mounted throughout for the hubbies to enjoy, and delicious food choices for all.  I've been to other Chili's before and their ribs are usually dry & overcooked and service is usually inconsistent, but this particular location has it down to a science! They even have a quick 5-question survey on the ziosk to ask how your dining experience was - that shows us how much they care about their service. Great job, Chili's management.

55,Dawn H.,"Santa Cruz, CA",116,26,,1.0,2015-01-24,"Firstly, the service was great. Crystal (I think - I had to call to check who was serving the bar so I could write this - Kim answered the phone and was bubbly and pleasant, by the way) was very likable and timely and great. Nothing that happened was her fault. I wish i had more cash to leave her at the end, because I know what it's like to have my tips suffer due to crap cooking and management. Chili's had pretty much lost us as customers due to so many horrible experiences and food issues. But we tried again, and they had made such fabulous changes to the menu - even little tablets at the tables for games and payment - just great! New menu items seemed pretty good so we've gone back a few times in the last few months. Too good to be true? Unfortunately, yes.  My sirloin/avocado dish was great - cooked medium rare like i requested. my boyfriend's (contrary to what we initially thought at first cut, as the manager did actually ask us to check before he left the steaks with us, which was nice - too bad we didn't notice right away...it was obviously not medium rare but it looked bearable at first) was medium well, almost well.  whoops, our bad, we didn't notice right away. but no, this was NOT anywhere near medium rare. server does the right thing and brings out a little plate to take the steak and not the whole meal.  A medium rare steak simply doesn't take long. and we were willing to be totally content if the new one came out right....or even close to right.  so we wait. and wait. and get more drinks. and wait. two steaks walk right by us. same kind as he ordered.....they had CLEARLY been put on the fire long after we sent the steak back. That is unacceptable. Our replacement steak should have been priority. So i am eating super slowly and trying to get my bf to share my steak so he can enjoy his dinner. he had a few pieces, but by now his potatoes and broccoli are ice cold. We saw our server trying to get the new steak from the cooks and manager multiple times. She never lost sight of the dilemma. Finally, she brings us a replacement and asked us to check it (looking nervous) - honestly you could SEE it was almost well-done. way too firm. Sure enough, it was WORSE than the first. Unbelievable.... So at this point we're just over it - bf doesn't want to wait anymore. So basically our entire meal was ruined.  I am WELL versed in corporate restaurant protocol for unhappy patrons, particularly when it was due to a restaurant screwup. Both meals should have come off the bill at the VERY LEAST. I am willing to pay for my bar tab, however. That I can understand. Crystal (who is totally stuck under that management thumb since she has to wait for them to void things - ugh I don't miss that frustration) is of course apologetic and brings our bill, which only has his meal taken off.  She tells us the manager will be over to speak with us. So we wait. and wait. and wait. And he does come over to the bar to do something but on his way back past us I said ""whoa whoa "" and he turns, looks at me (full eye contact and irritated look!) and turns and walks briskly away. Purposefully. (this is when i decide that infuriated yelping will be in my immediate future) I didn't catch the manager's name, but apparently it was either James or Mario (like I said, I called the front desk to find out who I had dealt with and there were two managers on duty. For what it's worth, this one was dark hair, bigger dude. Not much to go on there) So we do something I NEVER DO. We scrounge for cash for a decent tip and left only money for the bar tab. I wrote a note on the tab and talked to the server, making sure she wouldn't get screwed if we did this. Normally the only recourse a patron has is to punish the server, but she had been wonderful, and done all she could do. I watched her try to remedy the trainwreck. And for us to pay for my meal basically does not bring consequences to the (lack of) management.  Like I said, I know corporate restaurant policy, and in this instance, we should AT LEAST not have been charged for food. Simply removing a meal that never got served is not enough. BOTH of our experiences were ruined, and you can BET I am gonna tell the world. If the manager had just done the right thing, or at least acknowledged our presence, I may have let it fly.  They were not THAT crazed, just a mild Sat night. Normal night for a mall restaurant. There were two managers on duty. We were served leather twice. In an untimely manner. With no management contact after the fact.  My LORDY they need better management. Or to retrain the angry bub. That was a completely avoidable sequence of events. I feel terrible for the servers that have to bust their ass under that kind of non-supportive misled management. Their tips will suffer when average patrons don't know where to lay the proper blame. I loved my food, and was excited to find a new favorite I could hopefully count on. But I doubt we will go back now.

Second, my wife's silverware was dirty and  had to be replaced; thirdly,  our water had a funky aftertaste reminiscent of old dishwater.  Finally, after a long wait, our entrees appeared (chicken tacos).   The chicken was barely warm, way too salty, and tasted like cat food.

My husband looked at me shocked because he was thinking what I was. It was a flipping fingernail!!!! Are you kidding me. I gagged and just about wanted to throw the whole meal up. Our waitress got the manager.  He offered to comp my meal and dessert.  I didn't want anything else from their kitchen. No thanks.  I really feel like the whole check should've been comped.

I didn't ask for a manager because I was so frustrated and she didn't seem concerned. I will eventually go back but it will be a little while. I am hoping it was just an off day for the staff.

I was literally watching one of the hosts moving dirty dishes from one table to another I was like bro really. I'm assuming that they are hiring for bussers cause obviously they had none. The host went to sit some people at a table and the lady told him oh it's dirty over here too. When we were getting seated the host looked at the table and then realized it was still a little dirty and kept walking. Then we got sat in the very back corner surrounded by dirty tables. And it was a Tuesday night so it wasn't packed. Maybe because management wasn't there or they obviously didn't care to come out and help their employees. The host was a sweet guy and all, so was our waiter but the atmosphere wasn't the best. Honestly though I'm not posting this so management can come and tell their employees about how they need to try harder I feel it's management who needs to help out more.

2,Josh T.,"Santa Cruz, CA",0,27,1.0,1.0,2017-09-03,"I knew that we shouldn't have gone to chili's, I knew we would be disappointed but it's the chips and salsa. So we went anyways. Apparently they're doing an on line wait list in addition to the in restaurant waitlist. This translated into an extremely long wait, but you know.... chips and salsa. The two young men who were hosting seemed to be lost in general, like just lost but they were also busing tables so I'm sure that accounted for their general inability to function. Once we finally were seated, the waiter was relatively nice. We ordered 1 order of the ultimate meat meal combo or whatever they call it to share. We had to ask our waiter to go find our order after about 30 minutes. When it arrived, (without the fries initially) it was the saddest food I have ever seen. The corn on the cob was revolting it tasted freezer burnt and whatever they put on it tasted foul. The ribs were worse than usual at chilis, they had been sitting out for awhile, really gross. The chicken crispers were soaked in oil and just gross. The jalapeño cheese sausage was actually not horrible in taste but in looks it's was really bad. When our fries finally showed up they were ok, I mean it pretty hard to screw up fries.  The bill was 31.00 for two sodas, one entree and chips and salsa. The service was abysmal. While I understand that I shouldn't expect too much from a chain restaurant, this place is awful and has gotten worse over the years.  If the owners read these reviews, they really need to reevaluate how their restaurant is running. Also please take my advice, this place gets 2 1/2 stars for a reason! Do not go there! No matter how strong the craving for chips and salsa is! The service is horrible and no one who is there is happy, you will leave bloated and disappointed at how much you spent for the crap you got.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-capitola,2.0,2.39,2.39,,2.2340000000000004

I never come here because the quality of food was never good for me.  It was really busy during dinner so we expected to wait. They seemed understaffed as it took 20 minutes for a server to ask for beverages. Knowing this we had our order ready too.  Food took about 40 minutes to come out and you can tell the cooks in the back were swamped. I don't expect fine dining lol but it was still unacceptable. Food seemed frozen and heated/cooked too fast, vegetables tasted frozen and the steak was overly salty.  Their onion rings were good even with their watery ranch lol. I think I would have to be really wasted to enjoy their food. Although the people next to us had good looking burgers. I think Santa Cruz Diner would have been a better option and that place is pretty bad too. I think it would help to get... More employees to help out. The hosts were running around like headless chickens and bussing too. It was clear the kitchen had too many tickets or just unorganized.

We are also currently disputing charges with out bank. We came in and sat down at a bar table, waited for someone to come to our table for 15 minutes...even though a female waitress in the bar walked passed us 3 times without acknowledging us. The restaurant was steady but by no means slammed. Finally a big jersey shore looking dude came up to us and took our order. About 15 minutes later, our food was brought to us by a food runner who dumped and ran... and we still had not received our beers (which had been sitting at the bar for over 10 minutes ready for jersey boy to bring it to us). I had to walk up to the bartender and ask him to hand me our beers. We finished our beer and our food, at this point our server hadn't even come to ask us how our food was/clear a plate/refresh drinks..NOTHING, even though he was walking by to other tables. I walked over to the host station got a manager and expressed how disappointed we were with the visit. I told him I wanted nothing out of it, but thought he should know as we were frequent, long time customers and this is not how this place normally operates. He apologized, and said he would adjust our bill and talk with the waiter after we left. We pay our bill over the little electronic device and the manager had taken off our beers for our trouble. We left our waiter a $0 tip, as that was what he deserved for the 0 service we got (and I have never done that). This morning I logged into my bank account online to find our server added himself in a $4 tip. I will be calling Chili's when they open today, and going into my bank tomorrow morning to dispute the charges. I am shocked and they have lost a customer for life at this location.

The fajitas came out and the steak was two different temperatures. The side of rice was cold like it came just from the fridge. Then there was hair in the salad. The service is tolerable and probably adequate considering that they were busy on a Monday. But we waited a long time for our order and then for our waitress to come check on us. She actually walked past at least five times maybe more looked directly at me and kept walking. The Ziosk device also wasn't functioning so we couldn't even request the waitress to come. I don't think that we will ever come back again. I can say one mistake could happen but for both of us to have separate issues with our food and a lack of response from the staff it is something that turns you off to a restaurant forever.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-capitola,2.52,2.43,2.43,,2.466
