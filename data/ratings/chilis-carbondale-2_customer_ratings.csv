10,Peter G.,"Carbondale, IL",0,52,3.0,4.0,2013-05-16,"My favorite of the big box restaurants, near the Carbondale Mall.  If you join their email club, they will mail you a coupon for a free dessert and/or appetizer, good for M-Th, every week.  New lunch menu is appreciated.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carbondale-2,,,,,
7,Omar N.,"Anniston, AL",10,20,5.0,5.0,2014-09-01,"We wanted to try Chili's in C'dale and found the experience excellent.  The server was extremely courteous and polite and most importantly, patient. He answered our questions expertly and was very professional.  Chain restaurants are not always the best at anything.  This Chili's is an exception.  Service was super.  Order was correct.  Food served super quickly.  Quality of food excellent!  (We ordered the ""two for twenty"" chicken fajitas).  Facility was very clean.  Best chain restaurant in C'dale.  Loved the electronics at the table.  Slick way to tip and get your receipt.  We'll definitely return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carbondale-2,,,,,
6,Scott V.,"Du Quoin, IL",0,15,2.0,5.0,2014-09-14,"Great food and atmosphere, not somewhere we eat all the time but when we do it's always a good. Very kid friendly. Alli was our waitress and never left us hanging, by far one of the best we've had at any restaurant lately. Never leave this place hungry!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carbondale-2,,,,,
5,Keri S.,"Ashkum, IL",57,10,,3.0,2016-09-18,My experience here was good. My waitress was fantastic. I didn't enjoy the salad but only because I don't like spring mix salad and wish regular restaurants would still offer either iceberg or romain. My daughter the chicken crispers they came out under cooked but the waitress fixed the situation and removed it from our bill. They were extremely busy so service was slow but I thought they did great for how busy they were.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carbondale-2,,,,,
4,Randy C.,"Nashville, TN",56,11,5.0,5.0,2016-12-18,Great food and service. When we eat at a chain restaurant.We usually go to Chillis . Always great food and service,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carbondale-2,,,,,
3,Paula K.,"Chester, IL",43,39,13.0,1.0,2017-03-25,I usually love Chili's but this location is one I will never step foot in again. The waitstaff acts like it is a huge inconvenience to wait on your table and don't care if your order is right or not. Portion sizes are also noticeably smaller than other locations. I only caught on to this when I had been at another location (Fairview Heights) just 2 days earlier and the food I was served here was almost half of what I had gotten 2 days prior,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carbondale-2,,,,,

2,Pootums P.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,86,2.0,3.0,2017-09-11,This is a chain with mediocre food. The service and staff make minimum wage. Don't get your hopes up that this location is any better or worse than any of the others. Period.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carbondale-2,,,,,
0,Kim K.,"Burbank, CA",147,575,3293.0,4.0,2017-09-30,"Visited Sept 30, 2017 8 pm Wait time was over 30 minutes.  They take your name and cell to text you when your table is ready.  They also sent a text that had a link to show you where your place in line was.. however the link didn't work and when I brought this to the attention of staff, the girls response was that she was unaware it even sent a text regarding it.  She manually told me how much longer but i think she was missing my point that the LINK DID NOT WORK!  Regardless we were seated just a few minutes later.  Service seemed a tad on the slowly side,  but it was busy.  Our waitress (blonde female with glasses)  was friendly. Took our drink order.  Came back with drinks and took our food order.  My husband and I shared the steak and shrimp combo fajitas.  Plenty for us to share. We added on the white queso and salsa for $1 (queso was luke warm at best and it was a tiny tiny cup- maybe 1-2 oz?) Sides were great- quocomole, sour cream, shredded cheese, side of beans and rice.  The steak was a little under done quick made it chewy. And shrimp was smaller than what's pictured on menu, but it was good. Served with a bunch of floor tortillas.  Overall 4 outta 5! Kids shared a quesadilla with a bunch of stuff inside and they had no complaints.  I ordered a hot tea and wish I had a small teapot with now hot  water rather than have to wait to get a refill.  However when the waitress came around again she brought me a whole new cup of got water with lemon.  I appreciate them giving me two tee bags. Parking is ample!  The bathrooms were clean.  For $1.99 you can set your kids up with unlimited games on the electronic menus. You can also view the menu (bar menu said ""COMING SOON"",order food [however I like the human interaction and could not see a reason i would choose to use this service]  pay your bill, add a top  [with a sliding scale tip calculator]  and print your receipt [except ours was broken ]). This place gets packed but turnover seems to be pretty  quick.  So unless you are starving I say the wait is worth it.  Would come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carbondale-2,,,,,
