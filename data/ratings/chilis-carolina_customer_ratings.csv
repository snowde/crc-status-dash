0,Liz L.,"Carolina, Puerto Rico",0,2,8,5.0,2014-10-12,Chilis is great i love the service and the food is fast and good i go there a lot and they treat us like family . The dishes are great; Who does not love chilis! And also you can celebrate your birthday with a molten and the staff singing .The best part is the end : the dessert i always get a molten .  My opinion is that it is a great place for family meals.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-carolina,,,,,
