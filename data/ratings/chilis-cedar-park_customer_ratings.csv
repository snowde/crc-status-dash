62,Kristen F.,"Austin, TX",132,693,96.0,3.0,2012-03-04,"Ya know, it's Chili's.  My only issue with them is that they have a serious problem with their employees, chain-wide, not respecting vegetarian's requests to not have meat in their food.  I got served a real burger instead of a veggie burger once, which was probably the server's fault.  I order a salad with the black bean patty on top instead of chicken, but numerous times, little chops of chicken make their way into my salad.  I want to think I've caught all of them, but I probably haven't.  Be careful, y'all, especially in Austin.  You should know better. If you check in on Foursquare and show your server, you get free chips and salsa.  The one appetizer two entrees for $20 isn't a bad deal, either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cedar-park?start=60,2.316,2.316,2.316,2.316,2.316

72,Leslie P.,"Round Rock, TX",10,37,,2.0,2013-04-07,"I get more and more disappointed with Chili's every passing year. They keep cutting costs and quality while raising their prices. Unfortunately, there are few places in Cedar Park that aren't drive through open passed 9 pm. I tend to go in on the later side, order ""to go"" from the bar, and have a drink while I wait. This Chili's does get points for the bar and the regulars that make it a bit more comfortable while waiting for my order; however, orders do seem to take longer than they should. Will I go back? More than likely since my options are limited, but if I lived in Austin with access to late night options, I'd skip Chili's and hit up a mom and pop with better food and more ambiance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cedar-park?start=60,2.184,2.184,2.184,2.184,2.184

The food is bland and tasteless. I am amazed at how a simple -basic- dish like Fajitas can be done so poorly.

Later, when I asked my server, Justin, about her he confirmed that she had in fact left.  Well, needless to say my daughter was very upset. Justin to the rescue!

Did I happen to mention that I am a chef by trade? I've been coming to this Chili's for a number of years now, and the quality of the food and service has steadily declined.  I rate this on par with the Applebee's around the corner.  I don't recommend that place, either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cedar-park?start=60,2.4,2.4,2.4,2.6280000000000006,2.4

53,Bill W.,"Austin, TX",1,14,,1.0,2014-08-08,"Just finished eating at the Chili's in Cedar Park on Pecan Park Blvd. Used to come to this location quite a lot but they just lost my business! Crowd was quite small for a Friday night and we were seated very quickly.  Server was friendly but completely unattentive throughout the entire meal. Initial round of drinks took almost 10 minutes to get to us. When the server dropped off the meal she took right back off. When I noticed that my enchiladas had sour cream sauce instead of green chile sauce, she was nowhere to be found. Being very hungry I just started eating my meal. Our daughter got up and asked another server to have a manager come see us at our table. Well over 15 minutes later our server showed back up and I explained that my meal had come out incorrect but we were wondering why she had disappeared. She stated that she was helping out in the back (not taking care of her paying customers). She did apologize and offered to put together a to-go meal of the correct meal and comp'd the incorrect meal. Another couple minutes later (and nearly 20 minutes after our initial request) the manager on-duty came by our table. This guy said he was sorry and fed us some line that they were running out of things in the back (which was not the issue what-so-ever). Not a sincere apology from this guy at all, just more like (I'll do my duty and apologize and move on). When I explained to him about the unattentiveness of our server he said he would look in to it.

The food was terrible I got spicy shrimp tacos with rice and beans. Shrimp was okay not spicy at all, not even mild. Everything about/in the tacos were gross.The avacado slices were like sliced bricks (not ripe!). Tortillas were dried out. I got to the point where I dumped out everything from each taco and literally just picked out and ate the shrimp. The beans were ehhh okay. Rice tasted like it had been sitting out for a while. This is the worst Chili's I have ever came across! The empty parking lot made me think they were closed early..should have went with that first warning.

I got the Baby back ribs which i always got as a young kid going to Chilis.  The ribs were like i remembered them and were pretty decent for not bbq joint baby backs.  My side of broccoli was clearly frozen broccoli and it was rubbery and served not even warm by the time i got it.  Disgusting.  The apple cinnamon side isn't as good as i remember it being 20 years ago, and wasn't warmed appropriately either.  Just like cold apple pie filling from a can.   My wife's Margherita flatbread was kind of a joke.  Not cooked, and had a ranch based sauce all over it, so i have no idea how that fits the theme.  In fact, it tasted suspiciously like their southwestern eggrolls and dip.   Anyway for the price they charge for the ribs, i'd say you definitely don't even get your money's worth for what I paid and got.

Very strange and I didn't eat more than 2 chips worth. The chips were very good on their own, warm, crunchy and salty , which at least helped this appetizer out minimally.  I ordered the margherita flatbread which is an appetizer to share.  It was quite big with about 9 pieces, but it didn't seem properly cooked.  The crust reminded me of a cauliflower crust almost with how thin and pieced together it seemed.  The inner part was somehow not cooked through to where it had a gooey/doughy appearance after you took a bite.  The actual topping on the pizza did not really scream margherita pizza to me.  The pesto sauce on top also didn't quite match the description of 'drizzle' ... It was more like doused in ranch.  It did not seem like a pesto at all, but just full on ranch dressing.  It overpowered the rest of the ingredients, so it tasted like I was eating undercooked, cheesy ranch weirdness. I didn't try anyone else's meals, so I can't speak to their other items.  This is my first time ever going to chili's and I can say that I wouldn't opt to go back unless under duress.

They came out and looked and smelled very good. The smoke was readily apparent. They come with a side of smoky BBQ sauce, which tasted similar to Cattlemens bbq, which I do like. The wings had been smoked and then fried, which is a delicious combination. They are on the small side, but I like my wings fried crisp, and it's easier to do that with smaller wings.  This was a very good happy hour treat. I also like the table top system which allows you to reorder drinks and pay your ticket at your table.

I will start by saying that our waitress was efficient and helpful - she deserves to be working at a better restaurant. I ordered the bottomless chili and salad.  My server fell down in this one spot as she didn't bring me any chili until my dining companions received their food.  As an FYI - I have been craving chili for the past several weeks.  This version was simply WAY too salty to eat much of it at all.  It might have worked if you were just putting it on a hot dog - but not as a main dish. I traded it out for a couple of other soups and although they were OK, the salty trend continued and they was no doubt that these were coming out of a big bag. My wife and daughter got the half rack of ribs which were nicely done and quite tasty. We ordered chips and guac for app and it came out frozen.  That was replaced quickly with apologies from the manager - but the replacement was obviously also not fresh.

It was a dead Monday afternoon, Our party of 7 arrived to the ghost town. After the usual confusion of picking a table or a booth, we finally decided on the long booths to the right of the door. We were greeted to slimy seats covered in pepper that i decided was tolerable enough to clean for my family. At 12:15 we ordered queso. What we got was not queso, rather a mix of cowboy stew and corn, and isn't queso supposed to be rather warm? Ordering our meals at 12:30 the waiting games began. With the music blaring 60's disco and 80's rock and roll at full volume i could barely hear it over the TV overhead blasting the olympic games. Now without being able to hear a word my party was saying i decided to eat some chips alone and sip on a soft drink watching two random countries play volleyball against each other. Now its 1:45 and my brain cannot take anymore music banging or volleyball (even though i didnt mind the ladies playing the sport). Only one other party of 2 has entered the building and we still dont have our food. I would have given this review a 1/5 stars because of the wait, the noise, my burger came out cold, and two soups came out way too salty. I honestly feel like the cooks in the back were just having a bad day and couldnt stand working in the same musical environment as we were put through.

We ordered 2 simple appetizers and a main to share.   The appetizers came first and were edible. The main was okay but they left all the plates on the table, even though many were empty.  We ended up piling up the plates and glasses together like we were the bussing staff and nobody ever bothered to collect them.   I also ordered a cocktail to start.  It came 20 minutes after ordering and with the food.  Since I had wanted to pair a beer with one of the appetizers, they brought it all out at once.  When I asked whether there was any way of having the beer I wanted to pair with the meal and having the cocktail later, without it just sitting there and becoming warm and stale, I was simply told ""No. We can get rid of it or leave it here"".  Perhaps the waitress hadn't ever actually been to another low budget restaurant like Jim's but that was there response.  Like they were a monopoly! ROFL.   I went back in another time to the bar to watch a game and got someone who was very friendly but again ridiculously slow with the drink and delivered some expensive but low-budget wings.  No wonder the wings place next door is so busy all the time.  It's mediocre wings and a decent price and the drinks come through in less than 20 minutes.  Not a high bar, but it seems too high.  I would have thought you could expect consistent quality from Chilis; albeit not great but you could expect consistency and decide accordingly.  It seems that is not possible any longer.
