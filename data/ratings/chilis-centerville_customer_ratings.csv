The chicken crispers are good, and the fries are not bad.  The cole slaw is average/below average.  I was surprised by how average the ribs were.  I got them based on the famous ""Chilis Babyback Ribs"" song, and was disappointed.

15,Trevor J.,"Salt Lake City, UT",125,179,148.0,2.0,2015-10-20,"This is the worst Chilli's location I have ever seen! I go relatively often since my work gives out gift cards and this location is near my house, but I know to expect at least an hour and usually an hour and a half or more for my total visit, including not getting my food for the first 2/3 of that.  I almost always go on week nights and have been once on a Friday night, and usually show up around 6:45-7:30. We are typically seated fairly quickly (or at least as soon as someone eventually shows up at the host stand), then the server will usually moseys over after we've been there for 10 or so minutes to let us know that he ""will be with us soon"".  Not sure if these guys are just severely understaffed or if they are just bad a planning scheduling because the servers are usually covering WAY too many tables. Its also rough since we have kids so we are always fighting with them until the food comes, and when you are waiting to long for that things can get hostile. They've also been out of chip 3 of the last 4 times I've been, and on the last they were nice enough to run us out some free ones when they were ready.  The food quality has also been sub par at this location, and nearly everything we have gotten has been just okay and some things have been no good. Usually you can call fajitas a safe bet, what can you mess up on sautéed meat and veggies right, well the 2 times I ordered them at this location the skillet was not sizzling when I got them and the meat didn't taste great and veggies were soggy so I have not since and will not order them again at this location.  If you are a manager or owner of this location, please go do something about the terrible quality of everything here, Im not complaining because I am a food snob too good for chilli's, I love chilli's it has always been one of my favorite restaurants, and I with I could rely on this location, I like chilli's so much that I still go to this location knowing that it will be sub par compared to other locations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-centerville,,,,,

21,Andrea B.,"Bountiful, UT",8,8,5.0,1.0,2015-11-22,"If negative five stars were an option, that's what it would be.  Now, I have nothing against Chili's, its a good restaurant to find food with a big group, and all other locations I have been to are good. But the last time, and the very last time I will visit this location, was the worst experience i've ever had at a restaurant.  We waited 20 minutes to be seated, which was expected for a Friday night, then we were seated and it was seriously another 20 minutes before we even saw our waitress. So we gave her our order and were on our way. 30 minutes go by, and we grab our waitress for more drinks and casually, politely ask if they are backed up in the kitchen. When she realizes, she COMPLETELY FORGOT TO PUT IN OUR FOOD ORDER. Appalled, my dad says, we have been here for over an hour, are you joking? She apologizes and apologizes and says she has been working all day and that she'll bring out free chips and queso. So she does and another 15 minutes pass. At this point, I am done wrestling a restless 1 yr old, and had somewhere to be, so I just say, have them send my food to go, i'll get it later. So the food finally arrives, they forgot half the stuff we asked for, so my dad asks for to go boxes and the manager. And the girl has a confused look on her face so he tells her, my daughter had to leave because this took so long, you forgot half the things we asked for, I am just done I would like to let your manager know, we would just like to take this to go and leave. So the manager comes over, apologizes, asks what was forgotten and that the chips and queso would be free and we could each get free dessert as well. The waitress brings us the rest of our food and boxes, my dad orders desserts for us and we think we are in the clear. Then here comes the waitress again saying they can only do 2 free desserts, not four. So my dad loses it. Says forget it, just get me the bill, we are done and we never want to come back. So she panics, runs to her manager and brings all 4 free desserts, my dad pays, for the ""free"" chips and queso nonetheless, and leaves.  Side note: My neighbors were also there that night with a gift card the manager had personally given them because of a similar experience we had, so that they would come back, only to be told by her that they couldn't use it. I can only hope they can get it together, hire a new manager, because she is completely incompetent, and become a decent restaurant again, otherwise I can only hope they close and a better restaurant takes their place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-centerville?start=20,,,,,

The new ""home"" BBQ sauce was something else. I didn't love it and I didn't hate it. I couldn't put my finger on it. It was borderline synthetic tasting, but then I tried it again and it was just a sauce I hadn't tasted before. It flip flopped for me, so I just stopped dipping my rib meat in it. The dry rub on top was fantastic. My husband got chicken and shrimp fajitas. He really liked them. I had a taste and liked it a lot. They had a nice, light, summer-like flavor. The chicken was moist and the shrimp was cooked nicely. It wasn't shriveled up and rubbery like some I've had in my journey to find the perfect fajitas.

We all loved what we had and our server Daniel, was the greatest. Didn't need to ask for refills of drinks and our friend loved his lunch too and commented what a good server Daniel was.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-centerville,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
1,Dave O.,"Farmington, UT",3,39,6.0,1.0,2017-08-25,"Hair.  Full-on strand of hair on top of my steak!  I'm not freaked out, and I calmly told the server about the problem.  He offered to have the kitchen cook up a new one, but my apatite was pretty well gone, so I just asked him to take it off the bill (which he did).  Then...It gets REAL weird.  The server takes my plate with the ""hair-steak"" and I can see him showing another worker (manager perhaps?) and this guy clearly rolls his eyes and says something to him.  Then he comes back to the table, unceremoniously drops of the bill at the table, and walks away like he can't wait to get rid of us.  I'm like...""excuse me, we still want to buy a dessert please"" Lol!  We get the molten cake, and leave.   There's only two reasons I can think of that they would treat us this way; First, this ""hair-in-the-food"" problem happens ALL the time here, and the server immediately chalked us up as an unlikely tip, so why try?  OR, They think I planted a hair on my steak to get something for free!  Seriously, that is how they made me feel!  like I was trying to pull prank on them.   So ""Thanks a lot"" for adding insult to injury today Chili's!  I don't care how much we like your damn molten cake.  We'll find another place to spend 50 bucks next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-centerville,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
3,Suzanne S.,"Draper, UT",11,193,173.0,3.0,2017-09-29,"The table was sticky and dirty. The portable table credit card scanner was filthy.  We have been to Chili's many times, but not at this location.  My Caribbean  salad was good as usual. My husbands Mex-egg rolls were not good. His slider was good enough but was very plain. Onion rings ok- for the price we expected larger portions. The strawberry-aid was terrible, although the raspberry lemon aid was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-centerville,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
9,Thomas P.,"North Salt Lake, UT",0,94,,4.0,2017-10-17,"It has been a while since I've been to Chili's. The menu selection has shrunk. Our server, Monica, was great. The food was good as well as the portion size.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-centerville,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
4,Ele M.,"American Fork, UT",115,11,6.0,5.0,2017-10-19,"If you ever decide to eat at this location do yourself and request Jake as your server! I have never had such incredible service. Everything was perfect, and FAST! He had great suggestions for us and paid the perfect amount of attention to the table. Awesome meal, incredible service. We'll definitely be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-centerville,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
