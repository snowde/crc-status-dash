76,Anthony P.,"Chandler, AZ",6,16,,5.0,2012-01-08,Prob one of my favorite places to eat. Never have had bad food or service at chili's. The menu lay out is nice and they have a lot of good items to choose from. If you sit in the bar area they have nice flat screen tv's with sports on and it's first come first serve seating. Awesome place to hang out with friends. The one by the chandler mall is also the best I've been too. 2 thumbs up and 5 stars.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chandler-3?start=80,2.676,2.676,2.676,2.676,2.676

40,Laura S.,"Fairfield, CA",275,449,511.0,3.0,2012-04-19,"Chili's is my go-to place when I don't want to spend a lot of money and I am not in the mood to get gussied up for a nice dinner. That said, Chili's has raised their prices so many times in the last couple years that it makes me wonder ""Why do I ever go to Chili's?""  I could spend less money at My Big Fat Greek Express or Cornish Pasty Company (or similar places) and be a lot more satisfied.   The one thing that keeps me coming back to Chili's, other than its proximity to the Chandler mall, is the chicken enchilada soup.  I also like their salsa.  The thing of it is, I have copycat recipes for both of those items that are spot on so... once again... why do I go to Chili's?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chandler-3?start=60,2.444,2.444,2.444,2.444,2.444
62,Kevin C.,"Hereford, AZ",87,281,80.0,4.0,2012-05-06,"For a chain operation, Chili's has been run pretty well for years.  I like their recent facelift - they didn't change their look so much as to render it unrecognizable from their original look, but it looks more modern and is well-executed.  The menu is vast and pretty much anyone can find something they like.  The service at this particular location has been excellent for our lunch crew, across a number of visits.  Not spectacular, but never disappoints.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chandler-3?start=80,2.576,2.576,2.576,2.576,2.576

71,Jaswant A. S.,"San Diego, CA",37,577,427.0,4.0,2012-06-24,"I'm not a big fan of chains so whenever our eclectic foodie group votes to go to Chili's, I always feel  a wave of excitement comparable to that of receiving  an invitation to a Red Hat Society cuddle party. I end up going anyway placing value in the camaraderie of our group higher than an itch to try something new and different and maybe dangerous. The place is easy to spot because it's right on the corner of the little restaurant row part of the Chandler Mall on Chandler Blvd that includes Firebirds, Keg, Majerle's, Elephant Bar, etc. Funny thing is I'm always asking which driveway to turn into for the other ones but Chili's is the easiest since it's the first. Plenty of parking as it's shared  with other restaurants in the area.     So we've been here so many times we have our own waitress  who knows what we're probably ordering and we always get  the same table in the corner on the way to the restrooms.  Not that we're predictable or anything. I usually get the  bacon ranch quesadillas. But I might get the chicken  club quesadilla instead depending on how long it was since the last time we came by. Their burgers are quite decent as well. The great thing about this place is  there's a big enough menu to satisfy everyone in a big  cranky group. I'll give an extra star just based on that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chandler-3?start=80,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997

Stopped by today for dinner and we ordered the 2 for 20 special (an app and 2 entrees).  The food was alright-we ordered the Spicy Chicken Fajitas, the Bacon Chicken Quesadilla and started off with the Onion and Jalapeno Stack. The jalapenos were lame but everything else tasted great after a long day at work. What was not so great was the service. Two waiters introduced themselves (I figured one was training) but neither bothered to stop by and fill up our drinks or really check in. The girl who served us seemed to spend most of her time on the other side of the dining room and the teen host actually ended up being the one to refill my Strawberry Lemonade.

47,Claudine F.,"Chandler, AZ",15,102,212.0,1.0,2013-04-16,"Terrible service from this location. No one put in our appetizer order that we immediately gave to one of our 3 servers that was supposedly ""taking care"" of us. After waiting close to 20 minutes, our daughter's meal came out which we ordered with our dinners well after the appetizer. We ordered, onion strings and jalapeños so we knew even with a backed up kitchen, there's no way it would take that long for our appetizer. At this point, we didn't want our dinners sitting under heat lamps for 15 more minutes while they try to make us an appetizer. We had our 3rd server who claimed to also be ""talking care"" of us check on the food situation, and he let us know that one of the servers must have forgotten to enter our appetizer since it wasn't in the system at all.  We made sure to cancel that order. Then the first server, the one who neglected to put our order in correctly in the first place, had the nerve to come tell us that she will make sure that the appetizer does not go on our bill. Like we were going to pay for food we never received. The rest of the food came out, just a couple burgers. It was decent, consistent chili's quality. At least the kitchen was doing their job correctly. Not once during our dinner were we checked on. We even had an EMPTY beer and margarita and we were not offered or asked if we wanted another round or asked how our food was. Plus the server looked so inconvenienced when we asked for the check. We are not picky or rude people, so I really do not understand the horrible service.... I am in the service industry and even waited tables in the past, and I would never even imagine giving a guest as horrible of an experience as we received at this particular Chili's. Save your money, do not go to this location. There are  plenty of other food options near the Chandler mall. Advice for Chili's: 2-3 servers  for one table is excessive and unnecessary. Someone drops the ball at some point, which clearly happened on this occasion. The guest ends up with a terrible experience which they tell all their friends and Yelp about.... And your 3 servers get to share a NOT so generous tip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chandler-3?start=60,2.244,2.244,2.244,2.244,2.2440000000000007
54,Preston S.,"Oklahoma City, OK",162,178,32.0,3.0,2013-07-05,Oh Chilli's the butt of so many jokes. But you are ok. Not too bad. They changed their menu mostly for the better. Remolded the restaurant to a much better modern look. I love the fried Jalapenos and the spicy onion strings app. Really good. Just spicy enough for me. The fajitas and the bacon ranch quesadilla are good. The chocolate molten cake is always a good dessert. So moist and chocolaty and good. For a cheap dinner or for apps and drinks with friends it is an ok place and the prices are good. Much better than that apple place in my opinion.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chandler-3?start=60,2.444,2.444,2.444,2.444,2.444

The appearance of the interior maybe a little, the menu has had a few tweaks but overall it is still the same old mediocre burgers, steaks and for some reason now pizza. Tonight I had an oldtimer burger and asked for it cooked medium well, it was crispy as could be when I got it and lacking the flavor department. My fiancé's big mouth bite sliders were decent.

I mean, yeah it's Chili's and the menu is basic but give us a few. So we asked him to come back in a bit- he was circling back within a minute. Still, we were undecided. So, of course, once we figured out what to order it took our server 10 minutes to come around! And he was lurking over us through most of the meal. It was just a strange experience, and it sort of wrecked the meal. It was like any time we actually needed him he was never around and when we wanted some privacy he was all over us. Makes me realize how the good servers have some innate sense as to when they should drop in to your table. I had some enchiladas, which weren't bad. My wife ordered a chicken sandwich on pretzel bread- our daughter had the cheese quesedillas. The food was average at best.

Seriously is this what this SERVICE industry has come to!? The saddest part is that we have driven the industry with our inability to communicate with people face to face.

These men have gotten to know me on a first name basis and I'm not the only one. Hearing Aaron greet ""John"" as soon as he walks in the door is a daily thing, or hearing Eddie ask ""Susan"" if she wants the usual. It's awesome how much these guys care.

Parents beware...the Ziosk offers games your children will want to play.  While it may be tempting - the games are NOT free.  Since I have an adult child (aka husband) who thought it was interesting to see what was available, it ended up in an additional charge of 99 cents to our bill.  Yeah, I know it's only 99 cents but a bucks a buck, AND the charge ""could"" be per game title instead of per table.  Thankfully my husband only played one.   This is a very SNEAKY way to pad profits, so parents hand your kids your phone or ask for crayons and paper.  Leave the Ziosk alone!

38,Amanda V.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,28,2.0,1.0,2015-04-21,"My husband, daughter and I dined at this Chili's location five weeks ago for the very first time and then for the second time two weeks ago. Our first visit was one of the worst restaurant experience as we have ever encountered. My daughters grilled cheese came out 12 minutes after a food runner had dropped off my husband and eyes food. As you can imagine having a toddler who is who is hungry and confused as to where her meal is can be somewhat of an unpleasant experience. Aside from her food coming out 12 minutes after my husband and eyes my husband's food was incorrect. But unfortunately we never saw our server again so we were unable to rectify the issue. And sadly we both waited till my daughters food came out to eat so both of our entrées were cold. We gave that experience a benefit of doubt thinking they could've just had an off night, and this was just a random thing. So we went again three weeks after that visit and I have to say it was worse than the first. After we were seated it took over 10 minutes for us to be acknowledged at the table. Going on over 25 minutes from when we sat down one water and on beer were finally brought. When the beverages were placed at our table we were hoping to order our food since we were going on over at most a half hour of being there we already knew what we wanted. As the server place the drinks down she said she'd be right back well no joke more than 10 minutes went by still no server. My husband had to go up to the bar to get a refill on my water. He asked the bartender if we could place our order, bartender replied that she would be right over. Once we placed our order with our original server we know joke never saw her again. A food runner brought out our entrées which sadly were incorrect again. My chicken sandwich was cold, my daughters kids meal was missing her side, and my husbands fajitas were cooked more than well done and the runner failed to bring his toppings such as salsa, guacamole, cheese etc.. The runner came back a few minutes later with the missing items. But sadly mine was still cold.  After eating we waited around for our server to come so we could mention these issues to her and also get our check, but we literally never saw her again, the table behind us overheard us asking for our check and they mentioned that we could pay on this iPad looking thing. We were able to pay our tab, and left never once saw the server again. If the server would have come by once our meals were Broughton we would've had the opportunity to express our disappointment with her. But we were never given the opportunity at that restaurant. My husband and I hardly ever go out to eat with her daughter so when we do we choose places that are kid friendly. But also that we know can have somewhat of a fast service. There's no reason for us to dine at a Chili's restaurant for almost 2 hours when we know already what we were going to order. We were so upset on the way home that the food was not great service was horrible and etc. that I decided to send an email to Chili's customer service the following day. It took almost 2 weeks to get a reply back from them, and when I did get a reply it was so generic, They did not address any of the specific issues, but said they were sending complementary gift card. Writing that email certainly had nothing to do with money or wanting a free meal. But we were just six so extremely disappointed on the second visit that someone needed to know. Like I said before we gave the first visit the benefit of the doubt and decided to go back a second time. Wish we extremely regret. We will be giving the gift card away because my husband and I know for sure we will never dinette that chilies location, or any other chilies locations ever again.  I do need to know that I'm both visits the restaurant was not busy. There were many many many empty tables so it's not like they were swamped.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chandler-3?start=40,2.72,2.72,2.72,2.02,2.72

Had it not been for her, this location would be all but useless. My party arrived at about 8pm. After standing unattended for about five minutes, a host came and addressed us. They set up a table for my party (6 adults, 1 preschooler, 1 newborn) and we were seated. Eventually, a server came and took our drink orders. The drinks took about 15 minutes to arrive. Once the drinks arrived, we ordered. So at this point, it was about 8:30. We finally received our food at around 9:10/9:15pm. One member of our party ordered a steak with shrimp, broccoli, and mashed potatoes. The plate was warm, but the meal was room temperature, at best. Another member ordered pasta and received cold pasta and bread that was hard as a hockey puck. I had ordered mini cheeseburgers for my daughter (the preschooler) and they arrived with no cheese. Finally, I had ordered the loaded baked potato soup and they informed me that the soup was frozen and they could not make me that soup. That's fine, but they didn't tell me this until five minutes before everyone else's food came out! I have never had such a horrid experience at a restaurant. I don't intend to return to that location. The entire detestable experience didn't conclude until close to 9:45pm after we finally got to-go boxes for our cold-served food.

We started with the buffalo fried cauliflower -enough for 2+ to share. I've never tried this before anywhere else so I can't compare it to anything but it was battered fried cauliflower with a side of buffalo sauce. It was good but since they were battered fried one could eat so many.  My meal was great -my usual go to here. Since I don't eat meat my friend said her meal was great and was a huge portion enough for 2. I noticed they have updated their menu and have some new items too.

Didn't seem to have the same crunch as usual. They were brought to the table without little plates. I was finally able to get someone's attention after about five minutes.  Our entrees were a chicken salad, Old timer burger, and a sirloin steak. My husband pronounced the salad as ""okay"" and ate half of it.  The burger I had was virtually tasteless. I have to believe they've changed the meat they're buying. My daughter ordered her steak as medium. It came out very bloody and hard to cut. She gave up and asked for it to be cooked a little longer. To their credit, they brought her a new steak. It was exactly like the prior one, so she asked for a box. Servers were pleasant. Overall, we were all disappointed in a place we've been going to for more than 10 years. Not worth the cost.

Ended up getting 2 meat combo (ribs and the chicken tenders) along with Texas toast, French fries and New roasted street corn. Unfortunately we had a longer than expected wait for our food due to the busy environment.

My server/bartender (Cory) was great, he was full of energy and had great personality, probably one of the best ones I've seen yet at Chili's. The reason I am giving a 3 star and not 1 is because of him. My husband and I did the 2 for $22, which we always do. Portions are great, he enjoyed his food but I did not. I ordered the chicken fajitas and all the veggies were raw. (And the rice could of had more flavor)  I've been to chili's a million times and the veggies were never raw) My husband asked the server for new veggies and Cory did right away. He apologized right away and said because of the new menu change, the food is made differently. But the pictures showed them cooked..... but I was happy with his quick action that I thought the rest of the meal and our time there would be enjoyable. It didn't bug us that we saw servers and cooks coming and seating in the booth in front of us. We could hear the small talk but nothing inappropriate. What made my EXPERIENCE go down was hearing and seeing the cook come out and complain about the person asking for cooked veggies and my server nervously saying ""shhh that's my table over there.""  It made the rest of the time there awkward, hearing people talk about us. My husband liked his food and the fajitas could be better, more flavor for the rice and cooked veggies.

Unfortunately, the machine decided to suddenly kick me out, so I'm posting the review here instead. Our visit to Chili's was fantastic. We had been in LA in October and saw TV commercials for the first time in years. Surprise surprise, Chili's is blasting commercials about their new baby back ribs all. The. Time. Fast forward to today, and we're deciding on grub. Ribs come to mind, and so we head to Chili's. Now, Chili's in general has never really been on my list of places to go for food... It's not that anything is notably wrong or bad... It's just that for the most part, Chili's has been a heavy hitting contender on my mediocre list. Today was an exception... Today, we had Adriana as our server. She was AMAZING! Courteous, fast, and knowledgeable about the menu, and she was ALWAYS smiling! People don't often realize, but a smile makes a big difference in how people perceive you! She always seemed to be right on time with refills, without interrupting our flow of conversation.

Took about 5min for use to be greeted by our server. He wasint rude, but wasint exactly friendly either. We asked for suggestions on drinks he had none to offer. When asking about certain drinks the only answered he had to offer was I don't know I don't like that type of drink. Didint really have any suggestions about the menus either. My friend went with one of there penne pasta. She though it was okeay. I went with the unlimited chips salsa soup and salad. For the soup I ordered the chicken enchilada it was absolutely delicious I actually had two bowls. The fresca saled was just as equally as yummy but I would recommend having some vegetables on it not just cheese and. I finished the salsa pretty quick I asked my server for another salsa and it never came. I also asked for another Margarita and that never came out as well. The last soup I ordered was the potato,.... yuck bad choices. How are sold dining experience we probably won't install or server on other servers. For example I never got silverware. Our check was all messed up so we asked them to split it. When are check came out it definitely was not split. We had to track down another server to do it for us. When waiting for a check it took over 20 minutes this is absolutely ridiculous. Upon leaving the restaurant I need Italy got sick to my stomach and started puking in their parking lot. I'm pretty sure it was food poisoning from that potato soup because something was very very off about it. So basically I just paid $20 to pick up my home now very very disappointed in the quality of food and your lack of service. .
