21,Sasha S.,"Charleston, WV",11,195,8.0,1.0,2012-04-16,"It is rare for a restaurant, let alone a chain restaurant, to evoke any sort of strong reaction in me but just seeing the sign for this one makes me cuss. To severely curtail my rant I'll just say that it took 1 1/2 hours from entering to receive our food, our order was wrong, our waitress was rude, and when we contacted corporate they gave us certificates for about half the amount of what we spent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-charleston-2?start=20,1.924,1.924,1.924,1.924,1.9240000000000002
24,Kathryn B.,"Mount Pleasant, MI",0,8,,1.0,2013-03-10,"Memorable, but not in a good way. I went to a late dinner with three other people, we arrived around 9 and were less than greeted by the hostess. She asked us ""How many?"" in passing while on her way to another table. When she returned, she ""cleared"" our table and led us to our seats. The table was still dirty, complete with two old giftcard holders at the end of the table closest to the wall. The waiter that we had made up for the sour tastes in our mouth from the hostess. He was attentive and might be the only good thing about our experience. The food was mediocre at best, and served on dirty dishware. I ordered soup and was given a dirty spoon, a salad presented on a greasy plate, and the story was the same for my friends. One of my friends ordered chicken tacos, and they were too spicy for her (she wasn't expecting as much seasoning as they came with). She was hesitant to send them back, but our waiter was understanding and ensured it wasn't a problem. When her new chicken tacos came back, the kitchen staff didn't even give her new taco shells-- they scraped off some of the seasoning (not very well) and flipped them over. Good try guys.  Honestly, there are a TON of other places to eat around that area, so don't settle for this Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-charleston-2?start=20,,,,,
23,Eno O.,"Easton, MD",165,39,15.0,3.0,2013-09-07,"Went there for lunch one day. I had EXCELLENT service. I was glad that they had a lunch special that could allow you to get a soup and salad together. They were not stingy with the chicken when it came to the spicy southwest chicken soup! However, the soup did not taste great, though it was edible -- I finished it all, leaving some chicken behind. The asian chicken salad with some kind of ginger dressing and wontons was DELICIOUS! The premises were clean and well-kept overall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-charleston-2?start=20,,,,,
20,Lee L.,"Atlanta, GA",6,23,103.0,2.0,2013-12-05,"Wow. This visit was just bad. Do NOT go here.  To start, I walked in and waited and waited to be sat while servers walked past me and looked at me. There were actually people standing around doing nothing. I guess people at this location aren't proponents of teamwork. Finally I was seated.  My server was nice. He was energetic and somewhat attentive. I didn't have to wait very long to have my drink or entree order taken. I ordered the old timer with fries.  When my food did come out the burger was nearly cut in two. I'm assuming so the cook could see whether or not it had been cooked properly. Isn't there a thermometer or something for that so you don't mangle the food? My fries did not look appealing at all. I tried one and sure enough they were stale and taser awful. I asked the server if I could get a different batch since these were stale. I normally don't do that, but I love Chili's fries and I know how good they can taste. My server brought out another basket with fries that appeared to be from the same batch. They looked just as bad and tasted just as stale. I expected them to cook up a fresh batch since they didn't close for another two hours. I was really insulted by this demonstration of laziness and blatant disregard for customer service. I didn't ask for another batch as I was frustrated at this point and asked for the rest of my burger to go.  I love Chili's food and will still visit other locations, but I would rather shred $15 than patronize this particular location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-charleston-2?start=20,,,,,
17,Kin R.,"Charleston, WV",0,17,,2.0,2014-08-29,"I arrived at about 2:30 in the afternoon and the place was half empty.  Still, it took a long time to get a drink.  I ordered an appetizer and it took a very long time to get it.  My appetizer was dried out.  The place was messy and not particularly clean.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-charleston-2,,,,,
22,MR L.,"Washington, DC",0,26,9.0,1.0,2014-10-26,"Well, I know why their overall rating averages 1.5 stars.  Yesterday evening, we decided to eat outside of the hotel and decided to go next door to Chili's.  Greeted with a warm hello and then taken to a booth.  As we were walking towards the booth, I noticed napkins and food in the walk way and in front of the booth the hostess was planning to sit us.  I asked if he was going to clean the floor before sitting us and he said oh, yes let me get a broom.  Other people were already in the area eating (ooh). I thought if you keep the dinning area like this how do you keep the kitchen?  As we turned to walk out we actually walked pass the kitchen where the door was open and the floor looked like the floor in front of the booth.  So, if you are okay with dirty floors and overall dirty environment for lunch or dinner then stop by Chili's in Charleston WV connected to the Town Center or do like we did and go to Tidewater Grill (read that review for the outcome of that experience).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-charleston-2?start=20,,,,,
19,Wendy B.,"Sumerco, WV",1,10,,4.0,2014-11-01,"We ate around 6:00pm on Oct 28, 2014.  .  Always love the Chips and Queso.  Cajun Chicken pasta was pretty good, pasta could be cooked a little longer but overall good flavor.  Server was pretty good just needed to take our empty cups and plates.  Our table started to run out of room.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-charleston-2,,,,,
15,Serious C.,"Chesapeake, VA",1,33,26.0,4.0,2015-02-22,"Normally the food takes forever to arrive, but today was a normal wait time. The salmon was nice and flaky with a crispy bottom. The warm chocolate chip with ice cream and chocolate shell was awesome. Our server was attentive. If the floors weren't so nasty, as they normally are, I would've given 5 stars. Food was EVERYWHERE. The booths are never swept under so there was squashed food, and there were straw wrappers in the aisles. The seats needed cleaned from the previous guest's food droppings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-charleston-2,,,,,
14,Shelia J.,"Charleston, WV",1,3,,1.0,2015-07-30,"I never want to eat here.....NEVER, but my husband likes the fajitas. We ordered our food togo, I chose something easy, a cheeseburger with 2 patties, yet again a terrible experience. The cheese on the burger was so BURNT   that i thought they accidently added bacon; not a problem until I took a bite. The absolute worst. They will not get my money again.  Disappointed again, and still hungry. 1 star, only because i wanted to post my review. Iv worked food service and it maybe considered a menial job, but take pride in your work, and respect the money i spent on inedible food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-charleston-2,,,,,

12,Lisa W.,"Proctorville, OH",1,2,1.0,1.0,2016-05-02,"Worst service ever It was a busy evening, concert had just let out,,, however,there are events almost every weekend in Charleston, that should come as no surprise and businesses should be staffed to handle the crowd.  We didn't get to have dinner prior to the show, so he dropped me off and I got us 2 seats at bar to have a nice dinner before our hour plus drive home.  Bartender ""Bree"" chit chatted with man sitting next to me, talked with another couple sitting at bar, took 2 other couples orders. Absolutely, refused to serve us after sitting there quite awhile.   We got up and walked out.  Rudest bartender ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-charleston-2,,,,,
16,Nelson G.,"Charleston, WV",10,14,,1.0,2016-07-20,My wife and I went to Chilis on Saturday evening (7/16)  around 7pm. We wanted to sit outside because of the nice weather. We were happy to see that their were several empty two top tables outside and others. We also noticed that their was several empty tables inside so we thought we would get right in . We were wrong the hostess informed us that it would be at least a twenty or more minute wait. She took my cell number so she could text me when our table would be ready. Finally 35 minutes later we received a text. It was too late we were already seated at the Outback and had placed our order. Chilis had no wait staff and I have never been waited on by the same person twice at this location. About a month ago I did get to eat at this location and ordered their Cajun Chicken Pasta it is now severed in a very small portion compared to a year ago and no bread but the price didn't go down. This company continues to try and squeeze more profit out of their menu. It's back firing with me because I'm not going back good luck Chilis,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-charleston-2,,,,,
4,Melissa B.,"Louisville, KY",684,1154,12100.0,3.0,2016-07-28,"I was notified that I had 150 points to use that was expiring today, so I used them on a FREE appetizer...the loaded spicy cheesy fries with bacon, jalapeños and cheese with Ranch dipping sauce. I did the Lunch to Go since I work in the mall...All in all, ordering, walking time about 10 minutes...so I was extremely disappointed when it was so mushed together, cold and solid...very unappealing.  The girl at the pick up point was very friendly and helpful and so was the hostess....but next time I will eat there....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-charleston-2,,,,,
6,Kate L.,"Evansville, IN",14,5,,1.0,2016-08-05,"So basically, yes, it's Chili's. It's a chain.  I know.  Let's get that part of out the way, first.   On the way home from a family vacation, we stopped in Charleston, WV, which was halfway between our original destination and home. We arrived in town rather late (7:30 p.m.), and the hotel I'd chosen had no restaurants around it (which was poor planning on my part).  Hungry and tired, I looked on Google Maps for the nearest shopping center which I knew would have chains.  I have kids - chains work better and keep them happy at this point.  Plus, we were hungry and we were tired.  Oh, hey - there's Chili's....let's just go there. So, we get to Chili's.  It's around 7:45 - 8 p.m.  The place is not busy...maybe four or five other tables that I could see were occupied.  We were seated, and about five minutes later our server comes up (I forget his name) - personable enough.  Took our drink orders.  I asked if we could go ahead and order some skillet queso, and told him we were also just ready to order. At the mention of skillet queso (maybe it was my imagination) - this kid gets a real weird, almost quizzical look on his face. like he maybe didn't know what I meant.  I brushed it off as me being cranky. Server brings our drinks and the chips and salsa.  He tells us they're ""heating up the queso"" which became like a joke for our family.  Seriously.  The guy made like five trips back to our table in something like 45 minutes to tell us that ""they"" were ""still working on the queso"" or ""still heating up that queso""...until finally, my husband just asked him to cancel the queso order, and take it off our bill.   Almost immediately after that, our food comes out (I think he was waiting on the queso to come with the food...I don't know?  It's the mystery of the queso.) - except for mine.  I figured maybe he just couldn't carry all that at once...sorta shrugged it off.  Nope - mine was apparently still being grossly overcooked and so was not finished yet.  So, a few minutes later the waiter appears with my burger, and, alas, no fries, and told me that ""they're working on a fresh batch of fries"".  Great. Sure. Whatever.  Thanks.  (I am always, always very pleasant to people while screaming with rage at them in my mind.) Guess what?  My fries never arrived.  (I don't really care, because a) I generally don't eat them, and b) at this point I was just so fully pissed I had lost my appetite - but it's the principle of the thing).  Oh, and my burger was burnt.  Not inedible, but pretty crappy. During the entire 90 minutes(!) we were there, our waiter never refilled our drinks, and never stopped back to check with us, except those many, many times he stopped by to let us know about that queso...that 45 minute time period where everything seemingly revolved around the whereabouts of ""The Queso"".  Never checked to see how our meals were, never asked if we needed refills, never told us how to access our check on the Ziosk...didn't even BRING US A CHECK.  If I were the type of person who ""dines and dashes"", it would have been really easy to just walk out and not pay.  For real. So, you know - I was just so exhausted and annoyed and about ready to lose it, which I rarely do - when my kids and husband were finished eating, I grabbed the Ziosk thing, and pulled up our bill.  I was really upset to see that the queso was on our bill.  Not wanting to even approach our waiter about this, I paid it, and I did something i have only done one other time in my life - I undertipped him.  He didn't take the queso off the bill, so I took it out of his tip.  It's not something I am real proud of, having had many friends over the years who have supported themselves as servers...but this was really, really poor service.  I don't think it was purposeful, I just think the people there don't care. It should be noted that while we were there, there was a large table of people behind us who had to ask for ""to go"" boxes for their food numerous times.   So anyway - lesson learned...next time I will do more research on where I am staying, and I'll just hit a Panera Bread or something.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-charleston-2,,,,,
8,George Y.,"Daniels, WV",0,8,3.0,2.0,2016-11-30,Don't take chicken to go. They do not cook the chicken breast fully and they know you are take out and will not come back to complain.

7,Mark B.,"Saint Albans, WV",21,55,9.0,4.0,2016-12-15,"Update!!! Corporate chilies comped half our meal and the manager Chris is a great guy and made it right. Stuff happens and everyone has an off day. We will give chilies a second chance next time we are eating at the mall or want to have drinks. I should have checked yelp before going here. What a terrible experience. Our waitress wasn't very good but the worst part was the wait for food and food quality. We waited for over an hour to get our meals and about an hour before we got anything other than our chips that we ordered. My wife and I along with our two boys pretty much filled up on chips and salsa because our food hadn't came yet. Our waitress made mention about the fact that we ordered another basket but that was only because no other food was deliver to us. I asked to speak to the manager and on our way out I talked with him and he was nice but really didn't have any explanation for the poor food quality or the long wait times. The flat bread we had was floppy, the southwest chicken salad was soaked in dressing , and the loaded baked potato soup was weird and tasted as. We won't be back. You can see by my other reviews I'm not a hard person to please eating out but this was sad even for a chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-charleston-2,,,,,
11,Linda G.,"Charleston, WV",0,12,8.0,2.0,2017-01-16,"Had lunch there today. Ordered burger with ketchup, mayo, tomato, and pickles. Waited 45 minutes, finally came. It was 2 dried out patties on bun with mustard. Waiter said he would correct it. Came back with a slice of tomato and a metal dish of mayo. Then went back and got a metal container with 3 pickle slices that had some sort of herb sprinkled all over them. Ugh! Only good thing was the loaded potato soup that came before the 45 min wait on the burgers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-charleston-2,,,,,
10,Tom H.,"Charleston, WV",0,12,,3.0,2017-04-22,"I like this place - it has a bad reputation for slow service but it's because it's always packed! The servers arent the greatest or most friendliest I admit - and that's what brings the rating down - but they have really cheap and tasty margaritas!

9,Rony K.,"Marietta, GA",0,2,,1.0,2017-05-17,The food was mediocre at best and the Male Bartender had the personality of a wet rock. Of course he seemed a bit more attention to the male customers.

3,AJ B.,"Wheeling, WV",38,6,8.0,4.0,2017-06-01,"I was so thirsty. Well, I was hungry, too. I was in Charleston for the state baseball playoffs. I am hoping and praying that CCHS Maroon Knights play really well tonight.  Anyhow, after shopping for a while, I stopped by for an Electrician Presidente Margarita. Kellie, the bartender, was very pleasant. I could not decide what to eat. I had a craving for enchiladas but did not care for the sauce on the chicken enchiladas. Kellie said she  could have the cooks put the red sauce on them. They were great! I think this is a nice place. The ONLY drawback for me is the minimal space in the restaurant. I like to sit in the bar area, but here my back is to the door. There really is nothing that can be done about that so it just is what it is. On to the championship!
