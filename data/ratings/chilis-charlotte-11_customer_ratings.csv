43,Dave C.,"Raleigh, NC",12,108,,1.0,2012-01-06,"I want to establish something before I review my dining experience here: It doesn't matter how hard I slam this place.  No one that works there can do ANYTHING about it.  If you stocked Chili's with the greatest waitstaff, the greatest chefs, the greatest managers, the greatest dishwashers, et cetera, NONE of them could change the fact that the food is terrible. So, people of Chilis: I salute your service.  I am positive that you do your best, every day, to squeeze this fat sloppy pig into that prom dress.  I appreciate everything you tried to do, and I tipped you well. This being said... How can I describe my experience here? Friendly staff: helpful, quick, efficient, wonderful people, all of them.  Really. The food? Well.  First off.  Their chips and salsa is bad.  If I bought the least appealing salsa at the grocery-store, and the least appealing chips off the shelf, and put them into a wax-paper lined bowl, it would be very similar to this ""dish"".   Now.  Ask yourself:  if the chips and salsa are bad...  how bad can the.,.. Fried shrimp be?  Pretty bad.  It comes with fries and cole slaw.  The fries?  The fries are fries.  Eh.   The cole slaw?  Pretty bad.  All together, it looked like a plate of ""brown"" and a ramekin of shredded white, purple, and orange credit cards.  The shrimp tasted like... nothing.  Like chewy nothing and fried batter that squished when you chewed it.  The cole slaw?  Like crunchy nothing and mayonnaise.   Even the cocktail sauce was bad. Do I deserve this?  I mean...  shrimp from Chilis?  Even though the Atlantic Ocean is 4 hours due east, I bet that stuff came from some processing center in Texas.  It was DOA weeks ago when it was bagged, packed into boxes and flash-frozen. All together...  I think it was about $20.00 because the drinks are jacked up.  Two sodas=like 5 bucks, right?  Off about 3 cents worth of carbonated water and flavored syrup.  They always make money on the drinks... For the price, the food was awful.  Truly awful. Burgers that went to other tables LOOKED eatable, but still...  I can't help but keep thinking...  if the chips and salsa is bad...  what else is bad?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-charlotte-11?start=40,2.5000000000000004,2.5000000000000004,2.5000000000000004,2.5000000000000004,2.5000000000000004
36,Bruce K.,"Knoxville, TN",420,649,1234.0,3.0,2012-02-12,"Chili's, when I came here I came with friends for drinks. I had a great time, and absolutely no problems. Make sure to look on the table and check out their specials. We were lucky and got the chance and get free nachos. The drinks weren't that bad, however I personally wouldn't be a regular here just because the drinks weren't to my taste. I had a beer and called it a day. There's not really anything memorable about this place to me, nothing that stood out. It's a chain restaurant, so I can't say much about the uniqueness of the restaurant. I do say if you do come here, order the burgers. I'm a burger lover and by no means that it's the best burger out there, but it's not bad either.  Overall, come here for drinks and burgers. That's what I would do.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-charlotte-11?start=20,2.7,2.7,2.7,2.7,2.7

38,David J.,"Arlington, VA",9,7,,4.0,2014-09-15,"This was a slightly above average experience for the chain. A friend and I went to catch up during the mid afternoon and were very pleased with the service. There was a new promotion going on with tablets on each table that allowed you to play games. We thought it was rather funny and pointless but perhaps if you had children to entertain you'd be willing to pay the $2 for access. The sweet tea was not sweet; be prepared. Otherwise we both enjoyed our meals. My friend has food allergies and can't often eat spicy foods, but she was glad to find tex mex options that she was able to enjoy. I had the chicken pasta and was pleased, though next time I will try something else since there's a nice variety on the menu.

24,Mike K.,"Baltimore, MD",33,237,197.0,3.0,2015-05-14,"My roommate and I went here for lunch on a Sunday because our first choice was too crowded. It ended up being a great plan B. We got chips and salsa to start. My roommate got a burger and I got some tacos. The tacos were a new item on the menu. They had shrimp, pork, and chicken. You also had the option to mix and match. I went with two shrimp and a pork. The tacos were decent. The shrimp were called ""spicy shrimp"" but there was only one bite that I had that was spicy. Not sure what was in that mouthful but it was definitely spicy!! The food was decent but it felt like it was on the pricier side for a chain restaurant.  The new tablet on your table system is pretty cool. You can order a round of drinks right from your table without having to wait for your server to come back. They have tons of free games to play with your friends or keep the kiddos entertained. AND  you can pay your bill right at the table. You can even split it however many ways you want to right at the table. It's pretty awesome.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-charlotte-11?start=20,2.444,2.444,2.444,2.444,2.444

GRANTED, the only complaint I have (and it seems to be quite common to all locations), is that everything looks and feels sticky. I wish someone can just scrub the heck out of the tables and floors and chairs.   We went to Chili's mainly because they have a Cheap Bites menu that's served all day on Sundays (and we sat at the bar area because I dont' know if this is only for bar patrons). They are also avaliable during the week as ""happy hour"" deal and ""late night"" after 9pm. $4.99 and you get pretty much a full size order. My favorite item on the $4.99 menu is Santa Fe Chicken Salad. The portion is insane, plenty to share. I asked for honey-lime dressing instead of ranch.  While I'm not a big chain diner, I do find Chili's to have good food for great price. $25 to feed 4 people is a good deal!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-charlotte-11?start=20,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.48

There were several open tables to the right but most were booths that could not be moved.  To the left were plenty of tables that could be moved together. Hostess said she needed to see if manager would let us sit there because it was a closed section and they did not have 2 tables in the other section they could put together for us. She came back 5 minutes later and said manager would not open that section for us to eat together. I asked, ""so are you saying you want us to go somewhere else to eat?"" Her response,was something to the effect that perhaps a big booth Might open up in 20 minutes (but no real eagerness to commit to that either).  Sent hubby to Cheddars next door and even though they were much busier than chili's that pulled 2 tables together in no time.  As I sat in chili's waiting for an update, I watching several others people come in and get seated immediately. The problem was not they were too busy, it was that they did not want to put seats together in the closed section. They expected us to wait for their convenience.  Two things: managers that don't want to accommodate people should come tell them--not send the message through a high schooler.  If you don't want to seat people quickly don't build a building with all those seats to the left. Yes, I understand it is an inconvenience for staff if customers  are spread out;  but 1) you are in a customer service business, and 2) servers are not really needed to take orders with the table side kiosk.

We had 7 people in our party and each menu selection was awful!!  We had selected Chili's because of the consistency of the menu (no matter which restaurant selected)  Not sure if they had new or bad cooks but it certainly changed our minds about Chili's.  Not sure if I'll ever go back!! Very Disppointed",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-charlotte-11,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
7,Trisha K.,"Harrisburg, NC",1,3,8.0,1.0,2017-07-17,I give this chilis a no star rating. Only because my girlfriend ate the chicken dish there and not even 5 hours later she has FOOD POISONING!!! To the point where we are in the hospital room at 3:30 am until 7am.  Obviously the people working there don't give a fuck and they don't care if people get sick because I mean they still get their pay check regardless right? Yeah I KNOW IM RIGHT!  I refuse to ever eat anything from this COMPANY again!  TIP To Chilis: HIRE COOKS AND MANAGERS WHO GIVE A FUCK AND MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS OK TO SERVE. WHO KNOWS THAY CHICKEN COULD HAVE BEEN 4 WEEKS OLD BUT IDK BC IM NOT IN THE KITCHEN INSTEAD IM IN THE HOSPITAL ROOM WITH MY SICK GIRLFRIEND,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-charlotte-11,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36
2,Xina X.,"University City South, Charlotte, NC",179,1,,1.0,2017-08-20,"if i could give 0 stars, i would. first off let me begin with I HATE COMPLAINING, i understand how hard it is to be a waiter and how annoying customers can be, i was a waitress for 5 years. but the service on Saturday 19th was ridiculous, beyond unacceptable and unprofessional on not only the waitress assigned to us but the management in charge that night. we waited 20 mins for someone to even approach us and ask for our drinks orders (2 beers, 2 sodas), we waited another 15 for our beers to be brought to us. mind you; it wasn't busy, and our server was mostly NO WHERE to be seen. We waited another 15 to have our orders to be taken, and waited around another 20ish for the food to arrive (WHICH WAS NORMAL AND FINE FOR 2 STEAK DINNERS). we still hadn't received our drinks or silverware, and waited another 10 for both. i spoke to management about the lengthy wait and lack of service, requested another beer and they proceeded to get my request wrong. i was facing the kitchen, and witnessed the manager speak to the young lady and gesture towards our table; she proceeded to not only catch a attitude, but it was NOTICED BY STAFF AND CUSTOMERS, and the staff laughed at it! What?! this is customer service! you don't get to make a customer wait repeatedly for EASY things and then catch a attitude when corrected for the amusement of your coworkers! our food was cold when served to us and our broccoli was under cooked, the steak cooked incorrect. I didn't speak on the food because by this time i was fed up. I hate sending food back, and judging from the tacky response from the wait staff, i didn't trust it. Don't go here; unless you want to wait 1 hour for your silver ware and soda, or laughed at when you request better service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-charlotte-11,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32
1,Jonathan B.,"Charlotte, NC",0,13,2.0,1.0,2017-08-25,"This is the worst Chili's. The clientele sucks. The waitstaff sucks. Our waitress' fingernails were so long and yellowed and dirty. Our drinks stayed empty. Our food was cold. Our guacamole tasted of nothing. I could go on, but I won't. Just don't come here. UPDATE: SORRY COULDNT NOT SAY ANYTHING... My steak was over cooked, my broccoli raw and ice cold. My fried egg on my steak looked like a 3 year old had cooked it on A DIRTY PAN. Fajitas WAY over spiced, chicken pasta WAY BLAND. WORST OF ALL, OUR NASTY WAITRESS HAD HER LONG NASTY YELLOW THUMBNAIL DOWN IN MY SONS PASTA WHEN SHE WALKED UP. She pulled her thumb out and there was Alfredo sauce all over her thumb and nail.

I'd provide a picture of my food but 20 minutes later I'm still sitting here waiting on warm food to come. I would avoid this place like the plague.... well the update the manager asked us to come back and give it a 2nd try..... same story different day.... order all wrong when it came out so again I'm sitting here waiting for food while everyone else is almost finished eating....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-charlotte-11,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0

0,G G.,"Charlotte, NC",1,9,5.0,3.0,2017-11-11,"This Chili's has fallen off. Some friends and I went here for dinner last night and were disappointed. The food came out late and it was cold. I ordered a half rack of ribs and loaded mash. The cheese wasn't melted which was the first sign that my food was cold. We had to keep asking for items that were supposed to be with the food when it came to the table. The waiter didn't give us any silverware we had to wait about 5-6 mins until another waiter walked by to get it. Don't get me started on the women's restroom which was disgusting!!! This used to be my favorite location, but I think I'll go somewhere else next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-charlotte-11,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16
10,Liz R.,"Charlotte, NC",1,13,2.0,1.0,2017-11-19,"I did an  online order for it to go order. I gave them a few extra minutes since it was a weekend. The pick up time is at 2:15 and the directions were to text the words I'm here when I arrive. I did everything I was supposed to do, pre-paid for my order including a tip. I still had to wait 10 minutes in the parking lot for my food to be brought out to my car. My food was lukewarm at best. I went inside and asked for the tip to be refunded to my credit card. The manager print me a receipt saying he reversed the entire order but did not reverse it for the full amount. He left out the tip. When I questioned this he offered me a half baked explanation and ""promised"" me it would come off my card correctly. I now have $40 tied up with this restaurant while I wait to see what happens tomorrow. For one order. I know what WILL happen tomorrow. I will be on the phone with my bank making sure that I get the entire amount of my purchase refunded correctly. And from now on I will go across the street to Friday's restaurant for my to go orders.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-charlotte-11,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08

6,Janesha B.,"Raleigh, NC",0,5,,1.0,2018-01-01,"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. My boyfriend and I came to Charlotte for the panthers christmas eve game. Nothing was really open after the game (because obviously things close early on christmas eve), and this was out first time in charlotte, so we decided to go to this chilli's before heading to our hotel. IT WAS HORRIBLE. We waited about 30 minutes to be seated. Then we waited another 20 minutes before a server even came to get our drink orders and had we known the area we wouldve just left from the go. He claimed he overlooked us somehow, however he bumped into my chair several times. Anyway, this turned out to be the worst waiter we've EVER had anywhere. He didn't refill our drinks at all, gave us no napkins, nothing. The only thing he did was take our orders. When the food came it was horrible and burned. We didn't even eat and be honest we shouldn't have paid at all. Save yourself the trouble of coming to this shithole.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-charlotte-11,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92
