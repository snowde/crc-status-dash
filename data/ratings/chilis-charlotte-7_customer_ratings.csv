26,Candyce B.,"Charlotte, NC",320,767,878.0,4.0,2012-09-10,"We decided to stop in after doing some shopping and we were really hungry so we decided to give the 2 for $20 a try but we decided to Ante Up! And get an appetizer, two entrees, two margaritas and a dessert for $35! For starters let's get to the drinks! Yummy! Margaritas either frozen or on the rocks any flavor you want! I opted for the Pomegranate one on the rocks and my friend chose the frozen Strawberry. What I learned was when the bartender is your waiter...your drinks come out awesome! These were not all mix and no liquor she poured it in those drinks and they were awesome!  For our appetizer we tried the Texas Cheese Fries Topped with chili, jalapeños, green onions and finished with applewood smoked bacon. Served with ranch dressing. When you have bacon, cheese and fries how can you go wrong! My only complaint is that the portion size wasn't big enough! They were simply delicious but the little pan they bring them out in is a joke...especially when like us...you're starving!  For the meal, I chose the chicken fajitas...the fajitas came out hot and steaming just like I like them! The chicken was hot, flavor was good, came with 3 tortillas and a side of lettuce, cheese, pico de gallo and guac!  My friend chose the ribs...with the original sauce...the meat was practically falling off the bone and it was delicious! I knew that my friend enjoyed it because she always slapped my fingers away when I tried to get a second bite! Instead of the fries she chose the steamed broccoli which was a little dry, but edible.  The dessert seal the deal for us! We chose the brownie! it came with ice cream and a chocolate sauce....what more YUM!!! Needless to say we sent back an empty plate to the kitchen!!!  Overall, it was a great meal! Really enjoyed the ""ANTE"" up style!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-charlotte-7?start=20,2.448,2.448,2.448,2.448,2.4480000000000004
44,Brett B.,"Charlotte, NC",140,10,,1.0,2013-02-21,"We live across the street and love chilis. Both of us worked for the company for 5 years. This chilis has the RUDEST employees and management that I have ever seen in a restaurant. The cooks NEVER cook the food correctly. The last two times that we reluctantly ate there, we had to send EVERYTHING back only to have the manager come out and give us a smart attitude as though we were requesting a five star meal instead of a rare steak. Needless to say, after several chances, we will NOT be doing business there any longer. The drive to Huntersville chilis for a good steak is well worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-charlotte-7?start=40,2.084,2.084,2.084,2.084,2.0840000000000005
41,E R.,"Gastonia, NC",1,21,,2.0,2013-08-25,"Just went to Chili's last night for dinner.  My biggest complaint about this place is the service.  I know we had been seated in the restaurant for about 50 minutes before we got our food.  My glass of water was empty for the majority of the time (had to wait for the ice to melt to get any water).  Our waiter also kept changing. Now to the food... The chips were not the warm oily chips that you expect from Chili's.  The chips were just typical and kind of dry.  The salsa was ice cold.   On the plus side the food was good.  I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich and the chicken was excellent.  Everyone else at the table liked their food too.  I just wish the food had came out a bit sooner.   Also, I thought the hostess had good customer service skills.   I personally prefer the Chili's in Gastonia over this one that is near Northlake mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-charlotte-7?start=40,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002,2.2800000000000002

Stopped for a quick, easy dinner. I'm not even going to bother going into huge, long paragraphs for this awful place. My wife ordered a salad with grilled shrimp. The shrimp were raw. Completely raw. Sent it back. Came back, still waaaaay undercooked. She's diabetic and already took insulin so she had to eat. They didn't bother having the manager come by. Nothing. Just, ""well, enjoy your ride home!""  Awful place. Just awful. There are PLENTY of other restaurant that deserve your business in this same shopping center.

40,Ray A.,"Charlotte, NC",71,84,12.0,4.0,2014-12-09,"I normally don't like to review chain restaurants, but I had great food here and didn't understand the low stars. So now I'm here to help teeter them towards at least three. No, I don't work for Chili's or anything like that, see my other reviews. The MAIN reason I go to Chili's is for the ribeye or sirloin steak. Even though I try to stray on the menu, I keep going back to the steaks.  This place by far is NOT as good as steakhouse steaks, but compared to American restaurants like TGIF, Applebee's, and those others, this place IS the best.  The Good: Been here twice and EVERY time MY food was more than delicious. The steak was cooked the way I liked, the Salmon was cooked perfectly and seasoned as though I was the one that seasoned it. The guacamole is pretty good and the Mango Tea(bottomless) should be a good choice for you if you want to avoid carbonated sugar drinks. Our first server, I think his name is Irvin or Austin... I forget, but he was VERY good and patient. We have two rambunctious kids and he seemed to not be annoyed by them(unlike their big brother). He kept checking on us, kept our drinks flowing, kept the chips coming and even hooked us up on the lil' gaming tablets.  The Bad: Our second visit, the service was off to a rocky start. The hostess seated us. We asked if the we could get another tablet to keep both our little ones busy and she obliged. Our waiter gets to the table and he looked at us like we stabbed a puppy and ate the eyeballs... ""Ummmm.... you're not supposed to have two of those. Who let you guys have those? You know it's a $1.99 fee for each right?"" he said. Now we were unaware of the charge to be honest, my wife is a ""stand my ground"" kinda person. I would've just paid the 5 bucks. She talked him into getting the charges removed from our bill.... ""But I can't do this next time, you're supposed to pay."" After that fiasco that seemed to drag forever since I was hungry, he called my son(dressed in a blue and red Sonic the Hedgehog shirt, BLUE pants, I even called him buddy) a she.  RACIAL RANT: **NOTE TO NON-BLACK PEOPLE.... BLACK PEOPLE ALSO BRAID/CORNROW LITTLE BOYS' HAIR TOO. NO ONE CALLS YOUR SON A SHE WHEN HE HAS AN IMITATION BEIBER HAIRCUT...** After I called my son's name(a masculine name) for the third time I think he finally got the hint. When it was time to order he called him a him. Yay. Far as service goes, there was nothing else bad to report.  The Gist: I highly recommend this Chili's if you want a decent steak without steakhouse prices. Good for kids. Near the mall, food is better than Applebee's. Go when it's not busy. No military discount. Get the Mango Tea. Boys can wear cornrows too. THE GAMES ON THE TOUCHPAD ARE $1.99. YOU'VE BEEN WAAAAARRRRRNNNNEEEEDDDDD....... *ghostly voice*",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-charlotte-7?start=40,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.48
27,Nia W.,"Charlotte, NC",0,20,7.0,2.0,2014-12-25,"Do NOT go to this Chili's location. The service has been consistently HORRIBLE.  A couple of weeks ago my boyfriend and I tried to call in an order. The guy answered and left us on hold so we decided to go ahead and head that way while we were on hold. Well....we were LITERALLY on hold for 17 mins and were STILL on hold when we got there.  We walked in and not a single soul greeted us. The same waitress looked at us and didnt say anything 3 different times. So...we sat down and waited on someone to greet us. A guy finally came over and asked if someone had assisted us yet. We asked for a manager. (Before the guy came over...another couple with their kid came in and stood there and NO ONE greeted them either. we told them we had been waiting 10 mins and no one greeted us so they walked out.) The manager finally came over and we showed her the phone screen (yes, we were still on hold). She apologized and cooked our food for us and gave it to us free, drink included. Ok so we went again this past Tuesday evening and it wasn't very crowded. My boyfriend placed the order again and asked to subsitute shrimp for broccoli in our pasta because we are vegetarians. We got there, 5 mins after they said our food would be ready and it still wasn't ready. We got our food and left (shouldve listened to my intuition telling me to check the food). Got to the house....our pasta was dry as hell and the ""steamed"" broccoli was raw broccoli sitting on top of our pasta. NEVER AGAIN. I'm disgusted with this place. The 2 stars was only because the first time they messed up the manager cooked the food very well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-charlotte-7?start=20,2.216,2.216,2.216,2.216,2.216
30,Cara D.,"Charlotte, NC",3,22,,2.0,2015-01-01,"You know that feeling when you walk in somewhere and you should just turn around and walk out, we should've listened ourselves!  We went to Chili's because red Robin had a long wait.  Once we set down we noticed the table next to us was dirty (not bussed from the previous guests). And it was never cleaned the entire time of our meal plus a couple other tables around us.  The place was it really even that busy.  The backsplash on our table look like someone at sneezed on three weeks previously.  The food was slow but once I got to us it tasted okay.  Because of the cleanliness of the place I didn't want to touch that little computer kiosk they put at your table.   Even if the zombie apocalypse happens and Chili's is the last restaurant in town we will not go back there ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-charlotte-7?start=20,2.184,2.184,2.184,2.184,2.184
21,Greg H.,"Charlotte, NC",0,14,5.0,1.0,2015-03-14,First off I can't stand most chain restaurants as I view them no different than pulling into a fast food chain it's all about quantity over quality.  My wife is a fan of this restaurant so we went and took our 4 year old son and it was terrible from the start.  We sat down and didn't see a waiter for almost 15 minutes then when he came he asked us what we wanted to drink we order margaritas and water and he brought back the margaritas but NO WATER not to mention he brought frozen margaritas first and we ordered regular margaritas.  My son had a pizza that was burnt and I ordered ribs that came out cold as if they was sitting out and they put sauce on them and served. Instead of the waiter bring out a fresh batch of ribs he brought out a empty plate took my ribs and reheated them while most restaurants would of cooked a new order.  My wife had fajitas and that seems to be the only thing that came out decent and that was because of the steaming hot platter it comes out on.  Overall the service was terrible the total wait time to get our meal was 45 min and this is what you call a family friendly restaurant ?  Even the host was bad she was missing when we came in and once she got back it took her 5-10 mins to notice that we was a new arrival. Oh never mind she put us in the bar area with liquor even though it was clear that we had a small 4 year old child with us. smh  I wouldn't advise anyone to visit the Northlake location it's far too many other restaurants in the area and if this wasn't a franchise chain it would be closed I'm sure.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-charlotte-7?start=20,2.052,2.052,2.052,2.052,2.052

You can play games, reorder drinks, pay your bill, and my favorite you can see your current bill and monitor your spending. Our waiter Caleb was very polite well mannered and efficient.

My boyfriend and I chose the appetizer southwestern egg rolls, which were satisfactory!! Fresh and Hot! The waitress was nice. The problem started when we waited 20 mins for our food and it was NOT fresh and hot. We both had shrimp apart of our entrée and they were COLD so we complained. We demanded the waitress go and get us fresh shrimp, at least. So she had us pick through our food and gather all the shrimp so she could take it back to the kitchen, I was confused. Promising hot shrimp she disappeared to the back, taking another 15mins. That's when we demanded the manager. I give 3 stars because once the manager was aware of our complaints , he immediately took care of it. He agreed to give us fresh entrées but the wait was still about 20 mins because other tables had complaints as well. Any who, we took our fresh food to go while the manager expressed his apologies and told us he hoped to see us back again.

We were greeted and seated quickly. We both had burgers. They came out in a reasonable amount of time, and tasted great. My one complaint is they didn't seemed to be cooked to order. Our waitress was good, and one of the managers even came around during the meal to check on us. As I'm new to the area I'm not sure if the modern interior and food presentation is newer.

This one in particular is hardly ever packed, even on game nights. The menu is as reliable as you come to expect from a chain restaurant. Staff is decent - bar staff is always most responsive. Perhaps because they get tipped heavier and know that communication will be a way to ""up the ante"". I like the food especially because of the great variety here. You've got everything from sandwiches to large plate entrees and the like with Tex-Mex being the standard theme here. Excellent desserts - the skillet cookie with ice cream to be specific. I get a hankering for one of these from time to time and will literally go here just for a beer (usually a local grab from OMB) and the skillet cookie. I also love the mex-bowls because of the variety of ingredients all mixed up together. Ten-year-old me would've hated that stuff but even then I had their chicken crispers with corn on the cob and loaded mashed potatoes to chow down on.

When I mentioned the fact that it was state issued and I am legally unable to possess a drivers license in my state  due to the fact that I have a medical issue,they still refused to serve me, even though I am way more than the legal drinking age. All in all I'm not even mad about it, I just felt disrespected and judged, especially because I just wanted to grab a brew, a quick bite to eat and enjoy the Indy 500 on the way to the Coke 600 race.

19,A. L.,"Charlotte, NC",1,15,1.0,1.0,2017-01-17,"I'm not sure if it's the trend for EVERY Chili's to be horrible, but this one is pretty high up on the list. It was such a slow Tuesday night, after the dinner time rush. There were 2 tables, 1 just finished and 1 was eating. It was just the 2 of us for dinner and we had such an un-attentive server.. she brought us water and then our app.. took the order that was it. Drink didn't get refilled, (by anyone) we didn't even see her until AFTER we decided to leave because the order came out wrong. She was serving an 8 top that walked in and got so pre occupied that we were forgotten about... her excuse was ""sorry for getting tied up.. ""which I would understand but we didn't get any refills, our empty app just sat on the table for 20 minutes, and we waited for food that shouldn't have taken as long as it did with hardly anyone in there! Not to mention the order being wrong. She offered to get a manager, but honestly I don't want a manger to make an excuse and have things re made. It was a simple order. I get big parties mean possibly a bigger tip, but I can guarantee you we tip 20%+ so don't judge a table by its size and leave the smaller ones for larger ones... you're only hurting yourself. I will not be going back to Chili's ever again.  Ps: We did pay her cash for the app we received, so this is not a review for free food. I will not be emailing you to have you ""make it right""..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-charlotte-7,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6
7,LaTora L.,"Charlotte, NC",41,28,34.0,2.0,2017-03-24,"My family came to chili's on 3/18/17 to celebrate the life of my mother and we did have a fairly big party. We all arrived at abt 3:00p and was told it would be a 30 min wait. Ok, no problem.  The location was understaffed and had only abt 3 servers working. The location was not cleaned because of the amount of servers. Most of the tables were empty but piled dishes still left on the tables from the last parties sitting there.  At about 430p the manager comes to apologize about the wait and stated it would be another hour until more staff came in and gave out $5 gift cards to two people, but should've given everyone in the party one because everyone was all waiting at the same time. We did tell the manager that it didn't matter if we sat together or not because we knew it was a lot of us.  We ended up leaving and going to a different restaurant. It used to be an overall good spot to go to. I enjoy the house margaritas. The service has truly went down hill. I only gave two stars for the attempt of the two gift cards. Wouldn't recommend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-charlotte-7,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
17,Keith F.,"Hebron, KY",6,11,,1.0,2017-04-06,Went back tonight to try again. Last time they sat me and didn't come back for 30 minutes until I left without evening ordering a drink. I thought maybe it was a fluke. But no. Tonight they had people waiting on benches with over half the place empty. I stood for 10 minutes waiting to put my name in.

5,Ashley M.,"Charlotte, NC",0,16,7.0,1.0,2017-04-20,"I have always LOVED chilis, and I go past all other locations due to their uncleanliness to go to this one.  BUT, Saturday night a hostess was carrying a pants-less baby around the kitchen. The diaper was sagging and the kid had no shoes, no socks on, and had an obvious cold with boogers on its face. IN THE KITCHEN. And they were passing the baby around for everybody to hold. Then the baby was sat on the window where the cooks put the food for the waiters to take to customers. Not only is this nasty, it was dangerous for the baby   I won't be back after this, the manager didn't seem to mind at all that this was going on as he  was in the kitchen holding the baby as well. I hope they can clean up their act, as it hurts me to not go there anymore :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-charlotte-7,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44

2,Kimberly I.,"Charlotte, NC",78,50,38.0,1.0,2017-10-03,"Ok, so I love Chilis. Everybody always jokes on me about it but its always my go to for a affordable night out.  But this one is not the one to go to.  So one day I went with two other people to this location, I immidiatly went to the restroom while they waited for a table. I found them sitting at a table where they told me that we are leaving. They said they came in and saw the health score (this was a couple of months ago and it seems that their score had improved, I believe it was 93 or something like that before) and asked the host why it was low( kinda just having small talk not really expecting him to tell the truth). He said he just started so not completely sure, but if you saw the way the kitchen look then you would know! :O . Yea so we left.  So last month me and my husband was in the area and wanted chilis and for some reason we thought to actually give it a try since we did go all the time before that horrific last visit. I wish we didn't go. Everything was horrible Cheese fries were dry and seemed old. I mean pick up one fry and the whole pile come up with is because the hard dry cheese molded it all together. I got their chicken crispers and fries. I asked if it could be tossed in buffalo sauce. It came out with tenders barely covered with sauce. Cold tender at that. Even the fries were cold. Can I point out it was a slow night? Don't even bother giving it a chance. On the boarder is beside them and they never fail me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-charlotte-7,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16

No (sorry about the wait) or nothing just a monotone ""how many?""   So he sat us and we waited for the server and waited and waited and waited.  We decided just to leave!
