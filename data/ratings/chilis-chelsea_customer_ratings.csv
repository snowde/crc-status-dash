25,Tracy B.,"Everett, MA",159,857,3017.0,4.0,2012-01-24,"Love Chilis & Love that everytime I pull in the parking lot I get discouraged that the place is Packed...  Then I walk in & there are 10 people in the place, then I realize they all went in the Gym next door & just park in the Chilis area...  Went last week & they were having Trivia night on Monday @7... I was in the booth section & shouting out answers (prolly frowned upon)...  But I will def be back for Trivia night...  The waitress we had that night told us it was her first night & I have to say she might have been one of the best waitresses I had anywhere... She continually refilled my water without me even have to do the long last slurp where you are sucking ice to get the waiter/waitress to acknowledge you are out of beverage, yeah I didnt have to do that...  She was on point.. My son wasnt eating his apples - so she brought him oranges without being attitudy Judy like most people are when I complain about my kids eating habits...  She was great & it made the place great, but this Chilis never had a complaint from me!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chelsea?start=20,2.544,2.544,2.544,2.544,2.544

39,Montgomery V.,"Boston, MA",0,15,,2.0,2012-11-30,"I walked in and thought I was transported to the ""It's a Small World"" ride at the Magic Kingdom. Everyone was so friendly!! With warm smiles & hardy greetings, patrons scattered to offer me their premium seats. An off duty bus boy sprang back into service to clear the perfect table. I ordered a draft beer; it was icy cold!  I placed my food order and choked on an ice chip in my beer as I awaited its arrival. I looked towards the friendly patrons for a little reassurance only to find them replaced by surly men with neck tattoos.  Odd.  I became a little unnerved when I noticed the sweet girls sitting at the booth behind me were nursing huge margaritas with tiny Corona iv drips.  They cackled soullessly.  My food arrived. My veggie burger was stiff and dry. I inspected it more closely and became transfixed by a large white spot. Hypnotic mold?  I don't know.  The cackles grew louder and I just wanted to go home. My waitress was nowhere to be found. Gone are the days of free chips and salsa that I remember from my youth.  The new age of Chili's has arrived and it is bleak my friends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chelsea?start=20,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152

What else would you expect from national chains like this. I find the chips to be overly salty at times and occasionally the waitstaff being in attentive and borderline surly.

Finally after the waitress came over, she was rude and unresponsive. We finally put in our order, and eventually got our food 50 minutes later. The waitress said that the kitchen was ""backed up"" but all the tables that came in behind us got served.  The next amazing customer service experience was when the waitress was talking to her friends at a table, and when we asked for some refills she told us to ""wait a second"", spoke with her friends for another 5 minutes, then came to the table and greeted us with ""yes,yes,yes!"" The final kicker for our night was that we had to wait 30 minutes for our bill, and once we finally were able to pay the waitress pocketed the money and rudely gave us back our cash.

37,Justin O.,"Los Angeles, CA",133,168,523.0,3.0,2013-11-09,It's a Chilis. In Chelsea. If that isn't telling enough I guess you can read on. I pretty much just get the healthy meal options here. Mango chicken and tilapia. Things like that. Usually the dishes are decent sized and somewhat healthy but they are definitely just barely a step above TV dinners. Flavor is lacking and what they do to add flavor is just dump some salsa on top of the fish / chicken. These are afterthought dishes that work if you just need cheap food. Drinks are ok - stick with beers to be slightly safer. For some reason I really like their chips. Go for the fire roasted corn guac dip. Pretty decent. All things considered - we average out around the middle 2.5-3. They are open late so I'll bump to hard 3.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chelsea?start=20,2.1559999999999997,2.1559999999999997,2.1559999999999997,2.1559999999999997,2.1559999999999997

I once went here for lunch with five other people. The last thing we had to worry about was getting a table. The place was deserted. Only about three other tables were being used. We should be having a fairly quick lunch; that's what I assumed. Once we made our ordered, we all got what we ordered and the food was fantastic as usual. Our wait time was a disastrous 45 minutes! There was no effort from the waitress staff whatsoever. Keep in mind that our waitress didn't even check back from us at all after we ordered. We got no drink refill, and no notification on our food progress. This might be the worst service from a restaurant I've ever experienced.

14,Vezna S.,"Winthrop, MA",123,397,105.0,4.0,2013-11-27,"Came for lunch the other day and had a very good experience. Had a server named Brandon show us to our table. Throughout the whole experience, he was an amazing server: attentive, prompt and always with a pleasant demeanor.  We started off with just water, I got one with lemon. When I got it, it was kind of brown in some areas.. didn't look too fresh. I didn't like the fact that we were seated in an overcrowded area but I get the fact that it's easier to sit everyone in one area so it's easier to clean, bus orders around and attend to the needs of the many. Me and my fellow patron elected to get the 2 for 20 deal. I ordered the 6oz steak with sweet potato fries and corn on the cob. I asked for it medium rare and it was cooked to perfection! The sweet potato fries were great.. the only downside was the cob which was dried out and looked as if it has been sitting under a heater for a majority of the day. The other order was their Mango and Avocado Tilapia with rice pilaf and string bean. It was overly seasoned and the flavor was too intense. The rice was bomb though and so were the beans. The appetizer was their Chipotle Chicken flat bread pizza (half order).. it was AMAZING! I absolutely adored it. The next time I go, I may just get the full sized one for a meal. Overall, the service was fast and pleasant (thanks to Brandon), the food was mostly great and the price was affordable.

I visited on Sunday, 12/08/2013, with my boyfriend & father; and I won't ever be back. Our waitress never even gave her name (probably out of fear of her identity being revealed here for her lack of customer service); our food was room temperature, the cheese on my boyfriends loaded potatoes weren't even melted (that's how cold the food was!); there was a woman breast feeding her child (completely uncovered) at the table directly in front of me; and getting a beverage refill was like competing in an Olympic sport. The waitress didn't apologize a single time. She seemed completely unphased by the fact that we were unsatisfied. I asked for the manager and of course he profusely apologized and did his best to make things right. I really appreciated him for that and his efforts didn't go unnoticed. Still, I won't ever be back. Ever! * EDIT 2/12/2014: The reviewer below me (initials L.M.) sent me a note saying ""Mass Law allows women to breastfeed where they please... move to another state if something like this bothers you."" I just want to let anyone offended by my review know that 1) regardless of law, I would consider covering yourself while breastfeeding in a restaurant where people eat a courtesy 2) I would never move because someone failed to be courteous 3) please refrain from messaging me in anger/frustration/whatever because our opinions differ.

Then we must have sat there for an hour and a half and still didn't get our food. Keep in mind I ordered the California grilled chicken flatbread and my husband ordered a burger medium well. When we received our food, I received the margerita flatbread and my husbands burger was cold in the middle so he returned the burger. They blamed the service on the new cooks in the back.

At this point I just want t go home as everyone else is done eating already.  Rosa was our server and she was very apologetic and it was clearly a kitchen problem so we still took care of her. My biggest issue is that my meal was not taken off the bill and I didn't know until I got home or I would have made a stink right then. also when you have to remake a meal it would be nice if a manager came over and talked to us.

My boyfriend grabbed a new item called ""Classic 6oz Sirloin Steak with grilled avocados and tomatoes."" When we got our order his dish was missing a few things...like the avocados and tomatoes. We complained about the dish and she complained with us saying that we didn't ask for that. I work in a restaurant and I know for a fact that you should never fuss with the customer.

The cole slaw or whatever that was put in it made the overall taste awful. Why add things that don't make sense? The steak was also not great. Even at medium rare it was tough. The mandarin chicken was pretty bland. I drenched it in hot sauce to add some flavor. I can't even begin to tell you how the drinks were. The Long Island, overwhelming sour! Gross!! The margaritas were just as bad.  I will say service was decent. Our waiter was attentive. The bad thing, the electronic kiosk at the tables, they charge you!

We have come to know one of the waiters quite well and will request him by name most nights. Cody is always happy, genuinely happy to see us, and is one of the most attentive and courteous servers I have ever had. Whenever we have another server, however, they have all been really sociable and on their A-game. I feel like management has really put an emphasis on customer service and quality, and it defiantly shows. I have been to multiple other locations and every time I'm so disappointed by the service, cleanliness of the restaurant/bathrooms, and the food itself. I have literally never had any reason to complain about food temperature, timing, taste, or price at the Chelsea location. There are, yes, some items on the menu that I'm not a huge fan of, but there are lots of options that are outstanding. The sour cream chicken enchiladas are the best , and the endless chips and salsa are, in my opinion, the best deal and tasting chips and salsa around.  My husband and I will order a 24 oz miller light, chips and salsa, and entrees, and can walk out for about $35. It's a delicious steal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chelsea,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64

When I arrived I must have stood at the to-go booth for 7 minutes before a guy came out of the back coughing all over his hands. He must have noticed the disgust in my face which is when he directed me to the bar to pick up my order. Once I got to the bar the bartender looked perplexed asking me why I was sent over to her because someone was at the to-go booth. Well obviously not. So she proceeds to show some patrons pictures in her phone before checking on my order and taking my card. Once I pay I patiently wait and after about 3 minutes ask her ""is my order coming out at the bar or am I picking it up at the to-go booth"". She then says ""oh you can go over there and pick It up"". Like seriously when were you going to tell me. So I walk back over to the to-go booth again no one there. FINALLY a girl comes out and says ""I'll be right with you"". She comes back and asks me what I'd like to order. Are you effing kidding me right now!

Do not eat here it's not worth it and the men's restroom was covered in vomit yeck. The molten chocolate cake was dry and the lava was frozen not molten. Also the portions are so small.

15,Taja M.,"Attleboro, MA",116,25,,5.0,2016-08-04,"Well...since my last post my grandfather has passed away but nothing but happy memories of going there with him on our visits to last a lifetime. So...here's the scenario...Me and my girls were in a rush to head to a church service that we were severely late for. We were all staaahhhvin! yes, i had to exaggerate my Bostonian accent. Anywho, we sat ourselves next to the bar in a small booth and we all kinda knew what we wanted, but i was the only one who stayed true to not changing my mind after looking at the menu. This is an updated review of my last post in 2011, my my my after 5 years, Chili's has still got it! I ordered, of course the Buffalo Chicken Ranch sandwich with fries and I let everyone at the table know not to ask for any of it because I was going to leave no fry unturned...lol. The other girls ordered that appetizer trio medley thingamajig.  Our waitress was Jenny, she was awesome in getting us water, tons of lemon and had our food in front of us in 20 minutes flat. I couldn't believe it, 4 meals that quick. Everything was super delicious. We all had ""The itis"" after but our stomachs were very happy. She deserves a raise. She was friendly while dealing with other tables, not too talkative but we weren't down for the small talk anyways, as i mentioned before, we were stahhhhvin. I promise I will try something else next time, and might take the buffalo chicken sandwich in a doggy bag... Small tip: I ordered a side of jalapenos to take my spicy sandwich up a few notches and was dissapointed, they tasted like pickled jalapenos, very limp, and no spicy bite to them. Chili's could spring for a new jalapeno recipe or whatever you call it.  I shall return...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chelsea,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4

7,Rich T.,"Winthrop, MA",0,2,3.0,5.0,2017-03-04,Went around 6pm w my Mom cuz she was hungry for food and a jalapeño margarita. And I was down to PIG out too. I got the choose 3 and I got the baby back ribs cheddar and jalapeño sausage and honey barbecue chicken crispers. My meal alone was enough for her and I. It was awesome and the presentation was fancy for a chain restaurant. Our server was Jenny. Aka (Jenny from the HOP) and I will say she was awesome when my mom wanted her frozen jalapeño margarita she came back to tell my mom the blender would make it too spicy she asked if we wanted our apps and food at same time which we didn't and asked how our food was but not annoyingly for real she did her job good and it was busy up in there. Good was good took 1/2 home I was stuffed but over all a good ol' time,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chelsea,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68
12,Jacqueline G.,"Revere, MA",0,17,2.0,1.0,2017-03-12,Very unpleasant experience and will never be back. Service is everything and it's exactly what this place lacks. My boyfriend and I went in and seated ourselves at the bar area. It took the waitress about 15 minutes to acknowledge us and ask if we wanted a drink. She brought the wrong drinks about 20-30 minutes later. People who arrived after us were already eating. We then ordered our food as she walks away without me even finishing my order . It took another 40 minutes for our food to come out. Only to see the wrong order AGAIN and they completely forgot our appetizer. We didn't even get a discount for all of her mistakes and she had the audacity to look at me as if I were crazy when I told her that she completely forgot about our appetizer. Horrible and never going back,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chelsea,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68
17,Zaida A.,"Boston, MA",0,2,,1.0,2017-03-21,I was there Sunday. And witness a waitress in the kitchen  grabbing a bunch of broccoli. With the  bare hands and put it in a plate squeezing it to the side after having been in the register handling money .  (She was short and had color paint onom her hair ) another guy throwing food on someone's plate as if he was throwing a football .  When I went to pay I used their tipping system witch is not accurate. In reality I tip her 24 percent  instead of 20 percent when I google it. This is unethical procedure.  Robbing costumers is not right . I am contacting the attorney general.  BTW I was there between 4pmm-5.30.  This place was nice but not anymore.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chelsea,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6

From the chips n salsa to A wide choice of kids meals and he especially loves to play the tabletop games. So he gets something more than a fast food burger or nuggets and I get to have fajitas or something lite like their Mex bowls. Join their rewards program.

Came to this location today, just me and my husband and sat at the bar and watched playoff football. It was amazing!!! Not too crowded! The bartender was awesome! I am sorry I can't remember her name but the her service was excellent and she seemed to know everyone by name as they came in!!! We got the southwest egg rolls which are always amazing and the beef nachos which I love because each extra thick chip is completely covered with all of the delicious toppings!!! My husband got the south western burger! I swear to you it was absolutely delicious!!! All of the flavors come together so perfectly, the meat was cooked to perfection ( medium rare) their fries are  also great! Gotta give Chili's a big A+ but this location an A+++++++++",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chelsea,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88
