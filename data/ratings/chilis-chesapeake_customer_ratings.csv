24,Marv C.,"Suffolk, VA",33,288,62.0,4.0,2012-07-09,"My son wanted to come here since he thought they had mini corn dogs and it was our Man date (he is 5). I met the rest of the family here and there was no wait to be seated. My kids ordered off the kids menu. A corn dog and some cheesy mac, along with some fruits and veggies for the kids. My wife and I ordered the 2 for $20 menu. Chips and salsa as an appetizer and then she got the Margarita chicken and I got the chicken fajitas. I would say within 5 minutes our food was out. We got the main courses before even the chips and salsa came out. The waitress was apologizing all over the place but I didnt think that it was a big deal. We asked her to remember to bring out the chips/salsa and some chocolate milk for the kids. She did and she even asked us if we wanted to take some extra chips and salsa home, free of charge. We said no thanks, but I was curious to know how many people go crazy when food comes out before their appetizer to make this waitress get so apologetic. If that is the case, people need to relax a little bit and look at the surroundings where they are eating. This isnt 5 star dining, it is a Chilis The waitress kept our waters full and she was extremely nice. I have never sat at the bar or used the carry out here, but I have eaten here twice and it is good enough. $43 for two adults and two children isnt too bad. My fajitas came out steaming hot, and all of the veggies were well grilled. My wife liked her Margarita chicken that was surrounded in black beans in rice. My wife liked the childrens menu since it gave the kids lots of choices to make. I would suggest you skip dessert and head over to Starbucks across the parking lot for a cup of coffee and one of their pastries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chesapeake?start=20,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997
22,Tracey H.,"Suffolk, VA",114,235,37.0,2.0,2012-10-06,"We stopped at chili's around 4pm for a couple drinks before hitting up the theater to see Taken 2 (side note: Liam Neeson is a bad a$$).   First off, they don't offer drink specials other than margaritas and beer.  I'm more of a rum girl.  I was very disappointed that we had to pay 38 dollars for 6 drinks during prime happy hour time.   Secondly, the bartender was waaaaaaaayy too happy.  Almost to the point of being excruciatingly annoying.  Nice girl, just tooooo happy.   My rating is based on happy hour, or lack thereof, only.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chesapeake?start=20,,,,,

18,Candra P.,"Douglasville, GA",40,67,13.0,1.0,2013-03-25,"I'm cool if I never make my way to this locating again, I really wont lose sleep over it. The service was not awful, but it was pretty bad. Our food was very slow to come out and then when it did it was not hot. My husband ordered a new item that was on the menu and lets just say, pictures are definitely deceiving. We wanted to send our food back since it arrived only Luke warm however our server took so long to come back to the table we just decided to leave the amount of the check on the table and leave.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chesapeake,,,,,
12,Teressa L.,"Newcastle, WA",87,543,467.0,4.0,2013-04-12,"Ok, we have been here before and had either awful service or awful food.  We went back b/c I had a coupon for a free appetizer.  First, they have official happy hour specials now.  Appetizers(some) are only $4.99 and there are 2 beer draft specials.  We were there early(4:40pm) so this option was appealing.  The southwestern egg rolls were as good as ever.  The boneless wings were plentiful and had good flavor.  Not too spicy for my son to eat.  The mini burgers were a surprise.  I liked them a lot!  You also get fries.  This is a full meal and for $4.99 it was a great deal!  Husband had his normal Bacon Burger and it was as good as always.   Service this visit was good.  She kept the drinks full, didn't charge for the kid milk, and I never had to ask for extra napkins.  The food was great and we will be back to enjoy the appetizer specials again.   I worked in Chili's in college and I can say that they have their bad days where food is slow, service stinks, and nothing is right.  However, this visit was very good, and I was happy b/c it was probably going to be my last try.  Glad to see they have improved service and I like the menu options they currently have.   I did see the pizza on the menu but just couldn't bring myself to get pizza from Chili's lol",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chesapeake,,,,,
19,Walter S.,"Hampton, VA",38,168,4.0,4.0,2013-05-02,"This is the first time at this location for us so although we like the Chili's Menu items we were apprehensive above getting served properly. I noticed that most of the bad reviews had bad service at the heart of the problems. The parking lot was pretty full when we arrived but we were greeted promptly and seated quickly and not too close to any tables with children present. Eden was our server and I must say she is one of the best I have run across anywhere. Fast, efficient, great memory and no lost motion. As a business owner I felt like offering her a job on the spot. I hope the management realizes how someone like this can do wonders for a reputation.  Food was as good as we find at other locations and arrived at our table quickly but the service was much better than anywhere. We joined their email list and plan to return. I hope next time we get the same server or one nearly as good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chesapeake,,,,,
10,Maria C.,"Chesapeake, VA",425,563,9169.0,4.0,2014-04-08,"I haven't been to Chili's in forever...and this return visit was not a disappoint at all!! My dad and I did the dine for 2 option...an appetizer, and 2 meals for $20.   We had the cheese fries...and they were loaded.  Very tasty. I ordered the Mango Chicken: grilled chicken breast, brown rice and broccoli...very yummy!  I had the mango tea as my drink. Very Very good.  I had 3 glasses full!!!  It was on point! My dad had the chicken fajitas...they smelled and looked good enough to eat as well.  He enjoyed them and definitely couldn't finish it all. This was an awesome visit.  On a Friday night, no wait and the waitresses were attentive! We will definitely return.  I may return sooner than later.  They have themed nights that looked tempting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chesapeake,,,,,
23,Mitchel W.,"Alexandria, VA",19,7,2.0,4.0,2014-08-06,"I work nearby, so I end up eating here often.  The service is normally in the okay to good range on a scale from terrible to excellent. I have 7 levels on my rating system: Terrible,  bad, okay, pretty good, good, great, and excellent.  I don't always have a ton of time for writing reviews, so someplace that falls in the middle doesn't normally rate a review.  Today the service was great. I drink a lot of water and my glass stayed full without having to ask. The food was good, and I've always had good food here. I've tried a variety of menu options,  and never been disappointed.  Overall I'd say that this is a reliable place to eat. They ate consistently good,  and sometimes that is better than occasionally excellent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chesapeake?start=20,,,,,
21,Melissa M.,"Suffolk, VA",0,14,2.0,5.0,2014-11-19,"Last night, we went for Daddy Daughter Night Out... was really good.. they lost about 60% of power while we were dining (to include many lights in the dining room) to no fault of their own, but they did a remarkable job in still being timely with our food & drinks & were very kind, courteous, & up front with people as the entered. they point blank told them they only have so many tables with lighting! Awesome job, especially to our waitress, Toti!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chesapeake?start=20,,,,,
16,John W.,"Smithfield, VA",0,6,2.0,4.0,2015-04-17,Bowl of chili was excellent (with hot sauce for the heat level I prefer); made with real beef not with hamburger; top shelf tacos were also tasty with added salsa and hot sauce; Our waitress (Leigh/Lee sp?) took very good care of us too!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chesapeake,,,,,
1,Regina H.,"Chesapeake, VA",609,269,349.0,2.0,2016-02-16,"Service was substandard for the first time in years. The young lady just disappeared after taking our orders, her service partners delivered our entrees before our appetizers. Our waitress came out and giggled ""Your appetizers look bad, I will order you some fresh ones."" She paused as if she was waiting for a pat on the back for thinking about serving us fresh food instead of the appetizer she let die in the service window. Woo Hoo! The food was good slightly overcooked and lacked the presentation thst usually makes it.  appealing. We had pre-movie food. Fajitas and texas cheese fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chesapeake,,,,,
17,Dan E.,"Chesapeake, VA",0,2,,1.0,2016-03-01,When we arrived to a 1/4 filled Chilis we were told there was a five minute wait. When I asked why I was told they were short staffed. I asked if they were hiring and was told no. I then asked to speak to the manager who did not come out. After five minutes waiting for him we left. During this time no one was served. I guess all the servers were hiding in the back with the manager.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chesapeake,,,,,
7,Steph W.,"Portsmouth, VA",179,245,23.0,3.0,2016-03-16,"READ MY EARLIER REVIEW. A quick update, the business actually contacted me about the food poisoning and sent someone to investigate. Prompt action was taken and I'm actually very impressed that a chain this large took time to contact little old me and show honest, true concern.  Good job, Chili's. Maybe I'll give you another chance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chesapeake,,,,,
2,Rose M.,"Chesapeake, VA",72,201,1306.0,3.0,2016-03-17,"Having gone here several times I think it's fair to say it's hit or miss.  Food and customer service fluctuate.  On tonight's occasion everything was fine.  We ordered chips, and 2 salads.  Our salads were served opposite of how we ordered it.  I want it without tomato and my husband wanted chicken on the side. He picked the chicken off the tomato salad. However thankfully I only hate tomatoes and am not allergic otherwise his ""tomato less salad would have gotten me good with the pieces they apparently picked out instead of making a new one.  I picked them out and slide them to the side.  I love when a server knows what your doing and doesn't acknowledge or apologize for their/cooks mistake.   The rest of the meal was fine.  We skipped dessert as there was only one I really liked here and it's no longer served.     They still have their 2 for $20 special.  They also have removed a few tables and boothes in the dining area.  There appears to be more tables less boothes after their renovation.  I don't really remember how many of each table and booths there ate but it's a little more spacious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chesapeake,,,,,
15,Nancy D.,"Virginia Beach, VA",1,18,,1.0,2016-05-19,"I eat out a lot and I've eaten at this location a few times. Typical Chili's, nothing special about this location except for the fact that I found a little screw next to my plate when my food arrived. I told the manager and said that's pretty dangerous. I was nice about it and didn't make a big deal but I'd expect them to be a little more caring. That's clearly a safety issue and you'd think they'd do something because people could sue or get a restaurant in trouble for that kind of thing. Thinking back I should have taken a photo of it but I was trying to be nice and give them a chance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chesapeake,,,,,
9,Reaper D.,"Chesapeake, VA",0,29,1.0,1.0,2016-07-15,I decided to give them another try. Our last visit was pretty bad. Took three try's to cook a rare steak. Still didn't get after the third try. We walked..                                                    So anyway I thought things would be better after almost a year. No such luck. I ordered to go and still waited over 20 min. They didn't have many other tables it was 9:00p after all. I thought they ran over to the Mexican restaurant to get my order. Which I should have just went there in the first place.                                        But anyway not sure of what I wanted to eat I ended up here. I ordered two different burritos different proteins. Mine was ok although it sat under the heat lamp to long. The wife's was totally dried out. We deconstructed it and mixed withe beans in the cup. Then realized it was even the one I ordered. Sad sad sorry. I guess it will be another year before returning if then.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chesapeake,,,,,

13,Katee S.,"Portsmouth, VA",66,10,,1.0,2016-08-19,"Horrible experience both times I've been in there. Both times have been on a slow week day afternoon. Not a lot of tables. We were seated promptly and saw what I assumed was our server because she had the booth next to us and the table across from us. She walked by us three times. I went to the bar and asked if she was the only one working and the bartender was horribly rude and said ""no if you sit down your server will come to you"" I should've walked out then. Finally 13 minutes later (I timed it) a girl came over with drinks we never ordered and we were confused. The food was horrible, again, and way over priced. Asked to speak with a manager who I could see standing by the bar talking to the bartender. But he never came over so my boyfriend and I just left, no tip, no return customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chesapeake,,,,,
3,Tamekia F.,"Chesapeake, VA",106,64,207.0,5.0,2016-08-28,"Went to chilis for dinner and decided to get a tex mex bowl. I got the southwest bowl which had avocado, corn, beans, pick de gallo, and rice. You can substitute the rice for a quinoa blend which is what I did. It was extremely tasty, and very filling. Our server was very nice and came around often to check on us. My friend has a Cajun chicken pasta with shrimp. They enjoyed their food as well. I like the quinoa option they give.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chesapeake,,,,,
6,Shwanda S.,"Chesapeake, VA",45,56,166.0,2.0,2016-08-29,This location is really disappointing now.  We had to wait for a hostess to come to the front. She told us it would be a 5 minute wait because they were behind on cleaning the tables. We were seated after about 15 minutes. The waitress took another 10-15 to come to the table. We placed our order and waited 30 minutes for the appetizers to come out. The restaurant was only half full. The waitress did come and apologize several times. She was great but clearly had toooo many tables. It was another 45 -60 minutes before our main course came out.  My salmon and steak were over cooked and dry.  I enjoyed my drink that's it. Hopefully they will step their game back up.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-chesapeake,,,,,

14,Carolin H.,"Goose Creek, SC",0,2,,1.0,2017-02-04,"This Chilis is by far the worst Chili's we have ever been too. To cut a long story short, they are slow when they are not busy, it takes 15 min to get a beer... 20+ min to get food when they are super slow. The Managers seem to not even care. Oh and when you order a 22oz beer from the bar they leave a good inch from the top of the glass... happened twice now.

Ok we're outta here not worth even explaining.  The manager was also very non caring about the situation and did not know the definition of stagger.
