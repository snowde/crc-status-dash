25,Angela C.,"Livingston, TX",6,72,14.0,2.0,2012-05-31,"I've been to this chili's three times now.  The first two times I had horrible service.  The second time (which was similar to the first) we were seated and left sitting there for a good 8 minutes and just about ready to leave when the waitress came and asked for our drinks.  She then disappeared for a long long time.  She finally came back with a tray with my soup, my husband's salad, our drinks, someone elses salads, someone elses desserts.  I took my first spoonful of soup and here is someone with our meal.  I told them to take it back and bring it our fresh and hot when we are done with our salad and soup.  They did.  We had a hard time finding our waitress the entire time.  I give this a two star because the food was good both times, but the service has a lot to be desired.The third time we sat in the bar which improved the service tremendously because the bartender can't leave the bar so he was always there for service.  This is the key here - sit in the bar to eat or expect to be forgotten.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cheyenne?start=20,2.184,2.184,2.184,2.184,2.184
21,Brent M.,"Clarksville, TN",1,19,,4.0,2014-02-21,"This Chili's gets a very solid 4 stars. Wait staff is usually really good, food is always what you'd expect from Chili's anywhere. We go here about once a month and always enjoy it. The last time we went we had a waiter named Oscar. Hands down the best waiter we've ever had, anywhere! Fun, knowledgeable, made great recommendations, and the drinks stayed full! I hope Chili's hangs onto this guy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cheyenne?start=20,2.416,2.416,2.416,2.416,2.416
22,Mark J.,"Salt Lake City, UT",1,54,7.0,2.0,2014-05-13,"Had to wait for 15 minutes to be seated in an empty restaurant.  The guy at the bar just stared at me, while he was laughing with his friends at the bar, but definitely didn't make any effort to help. Multiple employees walking by and no one said a word.  Once I finally got someone to acknowledge my existence the waitress was quick and the food was pretty good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cheyenne?start=20,,,,,
24,Abby L.,"Steamboat Springs, CO",0,5,1.0,1.0,2014-06-11,"Wow. Service was just OK, but judging by how the owners conducted themselves I'd say we were lucky to be served at all!!!  That's nothing against our server. She was nice, but terribly mismanaged and being led by the wrong people. The two owners sat at two bar tables with their backs to the front door. We observed four different groups come in and just stand at the front, totally ignored. The staff that was on was busy so it's understandable they weren't able to help. But the two owners were fewer than 25 feet from guests (aka $$$$) at the door and didn't notice them because their backs were turned! We also endured an incessantly ringing phone. Again, staff was too busy to grab it. Apparently the reports the owners were working on just couldn't be paused to take care of those guests, either. If this is how the owners treat their restaurants and guests, I'd hate to know what's going on with the managers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cheyenne?start=20,,,,,
23,Ethan S.,"Cheyenne, WY",0,16,1.0,3.0,2014-11-22,"I've ate at the Cheyenne Chili's a few times and usually have mediocre experiences. The service is generally on the bad side but the food is good. I've never had a good experience with the hostesses - one of them walked off towards a table and forgot to take us. But - the last time we went, we had a great waiter by the name of Joshua. He was fantastic; always checking up on us and promptly bringing drinks etc. Joshua was a high point of Chili's but some better training of the hostesses and some of the other waiters could do this place some good. On another note, they have Dos Equis on tap which is awesome. Other than that, just your usual chain restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cheyenne?start=20,,,,,
20,Jacquie G.,"Cheyenne, WY",8,32,2.0,4.0,2015-01-10,"I was surprised usually chain restaurants are so so and other Chili's I've been to in the past were poor but this one so far has been great! Nice staff,quick service, great happy hour and lunch deals. Never have really had to wait much(sitting in the bar area).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cheyenne?start=20,,,,,
9,Jaclyn B.,"Cheyenne, WY",172,331,802.0,5.0,2015-02-28,Wow chilis new sweet and spicy burger is to die for. Best burger ive ever had from a restaurant. It was hot and juicy. Service was awesome very attentive. Best expierence ive had at chilis. You dont even have to wait for your server to bring your check you can now pay at your table. Would recommend the new menu at Chilis!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cheyenne,,,,,
19,Mike T.,"Cheyenne, WY",5,11,3.0,3.0,2015-04-08,"This location used to be an easy, no-brainer, goto choice for myself.  They had a friendly wait staff, food came out quickly and correct.  That was, up until about a year to 9 months ago.  Not once, not twice, but three times I endured having the dumbest hostess, worst waitress, or wrong/cold food.  Like they sucked.  Bad.  As far as I was concerned, they should have changed their name to Dyson's.  I haven't been back since. They recently did a remodel - I'm crossing my fingers and thinking I might play restaurant - roulette and see if their service has improved to match the improved decor of their business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cheyenne,,,,,
14,Jen S.,"Cheyenne, WY",0,25,5.0,2.0,2015-04-12,"We have occasionally had good service and good food here while dining in.  However, whenever we order take out SOMETHING is always wrong.  Whether it's cold food, they forget something or they enter the order incorrectly it's always something.  This is so disappointing because Chili's is such a good chain and their menu is great! I think that's why we chance it. Tonight for example the lady at the take out area entered our order wrong.  We had to wait for a manager to correct the problem plus wait on our new food.  My husband asked if we could have the salad they had made incorrectly (not that we necessarily needed it-but still) and the lady told him they needed it back because they were going to throw it away. After waiting, paying full price for what we had and finally getting home, the salad that had sat there waiting for the correction was warm and the chicken was a weird fatty texture that was not edible (Feeling grossed out thinking about it). Sorry, Chili's...think I have had enough.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cheyenne,,,,,
18,Tony H.,"Aurora, CO",0,6,,3.0,2015-05-31,GREAT margaritas and slightly overcooked steak. Well seasoned. Tacos were room temperature. Overpriced for what it was.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cheyenne,,,,,
16,Beka D.,"Cheyenne, WY",82,71,75.0,1.0,2015-10-17,"Really disappointed with our only experience so far at this Chili's. We walked in and gave our name for a table, but decided to sit in the bar table area instead as there was a long wait. We proceeded to start browsing the menus, when a server came up to us and very rudely started wiping the table down while we were seated in it, without saying a word to us, and walked off. Several more minutes went by and finally a different server came to take our order. We were mid sentence telling her we wanted two waters and some chips to start with, when she cut us off and asked for our id's. Mine was in my wallet, at home-which I told her. We were not trying to order alcohol of any kind, but she told us we had to leave. I work in a restaurant too, so I understand the need to check id's. But she, as well as everyone else, was so rude about it and didn't even offer to try to get us a table outside of the bar. We haven't been back since, and don't plan to!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cheyenne,,,,,
17,Jason H.,"Tualatin, OR",38,3,,3.0,2016-01-02,"Took a few minutes to be sat, once at the table we waited while browsed the menu. The server didn't know she had us as a table, but returned with our beverages seconds after we ordered them. Had no name tag on so couldn't get the name of her. They were out of pork for the fajitas, but the server made up for it with switching it with steak. Chicken was cold compared to the pasta underneath. Other than that food was good, dessert was the best part. Not bad overall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cheyenne,,,,,
13,Adam M.,"Lawrenceville, GA",4,33,77.0,4.0,2016-01-21,"I've lived in Cheyenne for about 6 months now and have eaten here several times for lunch. I have always been seated promptly and been served relatively quick. They Have never disappointed me. I get that people have bad experiences occasionally but I've never experienced what others have commented about. I will confess I don't usually come for dinner because I don't like crowds or waiting longer for food. I fee it's a great lunch option though. Chili's menu is flavorful and has a nice variety. I am partial to the inexpensive express lunch (soup, salad, and chips) for just $7.19.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cheyenne,,,,,
11,Luis A.,"Redondo Beach, CA",29,31,3.0,1.0,2016-05-08,Really poor service..food came out cold won't be going to this spot again disappointed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cheyenne,,,,,

15,Melissa M.,"Cheyenne, WY",0,2,,1.0,2016-09-30,I've been here several times.  It is not reliable food or service.  Last Tuesday was the worse.  My order was wrong and when they tried to fix it is got 2 over done microwaved hockey pucks for their mini burgers.  The waiter was nice enough but obviously never properly trained and later my daughter got sick from her meal.  Will consider Applebee's across the street the next time we go out.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cheyenne,,,,,
10,Parker K.,"Cheyenne, WY",28,2,1.0,1.0,2017-03-03,"This is by far the worst chilli's I have ever been to. You can order a cup of water for the ""to go"" and they will still get it wrong. I have never gotten an order to go and it be correct. Not to mention you are always going to wait at least an extra 30 minutes form what time they say it's going to be done. This is the 5th time and I am not going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cheyenne,,,,,
7,Valerie N.,"Omaha, NE",9,2,,1.0,2017-05-17,The food would have been excellent had it been hot and crispy as described in the menu. Asked for additional buffalo sauce for the chicken tenders which I never got. Service was poor. Will not come back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cheyenne,,,,,
6,Matt D.,"Palmdale, CA",302,9,,1.0,2017-07-30,This establishment is terrible.  I have given this chilis multiple chances with each resulting in a disappointment.  Servers are more concerned with joking with each other by the bathroom rather than providing service to customers.  I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cheyenne,,,,,
4,Kevin W.,"West Springfield, VA",2,6,3.0,2.0,2017-08-05,First and probably last time I frequent this location. The restaurant was empty and it still took 10 minutes to be seated. Another 10 for ordering and then the wait. We waited for 70 minutes before asked about a substitute since they ran out. Then our meals were delivered to the wrong table and we waited again for it to be cooked again. The manager was willing to comp our meals and give us gift cards. He was very professional and apologetic.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cheyenne,,,,,
5,Monica P.,"Seattle, WA",0,20,1.0,3.0,2017-08-18,"Fine atmosphere. Greasy food and bland beverages. It's okay for a quick stop on the go, but I wouldn't come for a big meal or formal meal. Service was good, I must say, but, to my annoyance, all the glasses were plastic and I was brought copious amounts of soda without my request. I could come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cheyenne,,,,,
8,Bonnie T.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,10,,5.0,2017-08-20,The food here was really good and I liked my Saddle Bronc beer. Our waitress was extremely helpful (recommended a taster for the local brews) and made us laugh. A lot. I highly recommend the Cheyenne Chili's. Give it a shot.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cheyenne,,,,,
3,Nichole G.,"St. George, UT",0,38,3.0,2.0,2017-09-14,"Not the best chilis. Ordered a side salad and it came out so hot! I asked him to take it back. A salad is suppose to be cold and refreshing, not have cheese melting on it it's so hot. I also got the salmon and the bottom was so burnt and they drenched it in sauce almost like they were trying to hide something. It was not good. My husband got a steak that he couldn't eat because there were still so many tendons in it! Really cheap meat and not so good cooks working here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cheyenne,,,,,
2,Sara M.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,39,,1.0,2017-09-29,I truly don't like chili's. Never impressed when I come here. Food isn't worth it and service is typically slow. I don't trust that anything is fresh. Chains can really suck.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cheyenne,,,,,
1,Mike D.,"Newcastle, WY",0,95,32.0,3.0,2017-10-07,"Had the waffle chicken which was good.  Not great service, but he waiter was new.  Son had a burger that he said was good.  We will be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cheyenne,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
0,Laura R.,"Bennett, CO",0,37,278.0,3.0,2018-01-13,Middle of the road ok eats. Been here too many times to count. Franchise owner does not partake in the rewards program. Our waitress waited too long to fill my water I started drinking husbands tea and sharing my kids Water. Other waitress tried to give us food (ours was already on our table) that was not ours. On way out we got bottlenecked a bit and another waitress said here is your tea without ice and the guy said I had a club soda. Mabe they have too many new employees? Or their training isn't great. It's basic but we are still in hopes to find a hole in the wall type deal. Desserts are expensive but good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cheyenne,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
