I get that it's an airport restaurant, but I think that it's always rude to interrupt someone before they can end a sentence.  Rude service is one thing, but bad food is another. My eggs came out cold and the toast and hash browns were soggy. The bacon was warm, at least, but hardly crisp. I expected at least some quality food to come out of Chili's, but this was really disappointing, especially with prices around $10 a meal. I think this might be the only sit down breakfast place you can go to in Terminal 2, so I suppose this Chili's can get away with putting out bad food.

It is almost unbelievable that I just typed that, since I have eschewed that particular chain for years, but you'll soon understand. First, let me say that I had stayed up all night packing and preparing to leave town for a last minute trip, after leaving work after 12 am. My flight was scheduled for 6 am, so that didn't leave me much time to cook myself something.  I was at ORD by 4 am, checked in by 5 am, waitlisted by 6 am, and STARVING at 8! I did not want a bagel, a sandwich, oatmeal, or a wrap. At this point, I wanted a full-blown breakfast. Johnny Rockets had b-fast sammies, Argo Tea had oatmeal and quichelets, and McCrapold's had that stuff they serve. Where to find bacon, eggs, pancakes, and hash browns, or something very close to that selection of breakfast delights? Well, look over there: Chili's offered JUST that! It was billed as the Classic American Feast (or some similar moniker), and included ALL if the above for about $14. I'll take it, along with a cup a coffee! Well, let me just say that I LOVE breakfast food, and can eat it from most anywhere, and at any time. I even like Denny's! I learned, from them, to ask for ""shell eggs"" in order to avoid the eggsandotherstuff that come in a carton in liquid form that many places try to pass off as scrambled eggs. My meal arrived, looking tasty, except I got eggs over medium, instead of scrambled medium. I brought it to the attention of my server, and she took my plate rectify the error. She promptly returned the same plate to me three (3) minutes later with the egg glop from a carton, very crispy bacon, rather crispy potato cubes, and slightly warm bisquick pancakes alongside 2 pats of butter and two containers of syrup. See picture. The coffee was strong, bitter, and the color of a newly paved street, with notes of ash and embers. I could have had a Big Breakfast from the yellow arches (do they still have those??), or a couple of Dollar Menu wrap thingies from Dunkin, for all of the quality this meal lacked. Mind you, I was really hungry! Not a kinda hungry, or an ""I could eat"" hungry, but the my-stomach-is-now-nibbling-on-my-back kind of hungry!

Lol.  Two things.  First, put about an inch of lettuce on it which sounds great but it was shredded lettuce (basically like confetti) which meant that every article of clothing I owned also had lettuce on it.  Then, they took the turkey and it was rolled into six tubes.  Between the lettuce and the turkey I must have out the sandwich back together 15 times. Ugh. How irritating.   The service, however was quick and the waitress was on top of it. I thought I had her once when I was sipping the last inch of iced tea and as I sat it down there she was to fill it up. For her service I would give her 5 stars.

I had asked for no lettuce (the cashier needed help to figure out how to put that into the computer. He got help but somehow) I still had lettuce on my sandwich.

We weren't sure which sodas were available since the menus were so scratched up that you couldn't read anything on the covers. I went for the buffalo chicken ranch sandwich, while my wife had a three starter combo as a main. We waited a while for our food, during which time the table next door (I say next door, when I've actually sat further away from people I've shared a table with before) had their starter and mains brought about three minutes apart and then one of the mains got messed up. My wife's food turned up partly cold, while mine was entirely luke warm. We got checked on when we were already pretty much done. Besides, I had to catch a flight, so what was I gonna do but eat it? We asked for our cheque, and then she went and served some other tables before she finally got around to running off our bill.
