18,Mansi S.,"Santa Clara, CA",60,121,394.0,4.0,2012-10-11,"Chilis is my favorite spot  for drinks and all the comfort fried food. But this is by far the best Chilis I've been to. I have been to the one in Santa Clara,  California and even though i love their food but somehow the food always tasted stale especially the Chicken Margarita. But this one in Ann Arbor, their food tastes so fresh and delicious. I dont know if they make it differently (which i doubt since its a chain) , the food tastes fantastic anyday everyday!!! I recommend going to this location than any other coz i can simply vouch for their fresh food!! The service too is fast and the servers are friendly. Never Disappointed to go to this Chilis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cincinnati-4,,,,,
21,Chris C.,"Cincinnati, OH",74,137,34.0,2.0,2012-10-29,"Chili's = normally consistent and pretty good for the money however...My wife and I must have caught them on a bad night, because our experience was horrible. Got our drinks wrong, got my food wrong, and by the time they replaced my food my wife's food was cold. In other words, neither of us got to enjoy our meals. I will give credit to the manager, because she covered our bill...however it was covered already because we had a gift card! At the end of the day, our meals were free and I ended up giving the gift card to a friend because we didn't want to suffer through another meal at this Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cincinnati-4?start=20,,,,,
23,Mr. And Mrs. H.,"Mount Juliet, TN",46,254,1149.0,2.0,2012-11-24,"Food and service were typical Chili's.  I am grossed out by the giant kiosks they have added to every table.  They are sticky and fingerprint laden.  I wonder if they ever wipe them off.  These intrude on the table space, so I moved ours off to a near-by ledge.  Then promptly sanitized my hands.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cincinnati-4?start=20,,,,,
20,Todd L.,"Loveland, OH",4,83,5.0,1.0,2013-02-24,"The chain in general is just horrible now. Chilis used to be decent, but now it is like O'Charleys HORRIBLE. Although, I will admit I hate big chain restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cincinnati-4?start=20,,,,,
19,Jill C.,"Bowling Green, OH",23,31,,1.0,2014-06-03,"It's a shame they put all the hard work into making the outside look clean and updated - too bad they forgot about the inside.  My husband and I used to always LOVE going to Chili's and gave up some time again due to the condition of the inside...dirty, smelled, tables felt sticky etc.,  So after we say the outside changes we thought - let's go and give it another try.  We stepped inside into the bar area, sat down, felt the table, remember the bad smell and got up and left..and no one even noticed that worked there!  So - sorry Chili's...not a fan!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cincinnati-4,,,,,
17,Shannon D.,"Medford, MA",94,159,76.0,4.0,2014-07-26,"Great experience at this Chili's location. Our server was friendly and attentive. I really enjoy the fact that Chili's often has new menu items, and in my opinion it is one of the best chain style restaurants. My food was flavorful and came out pretty fast.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cincinnati-4,,,,,
16,Milian L.,"Reading, Cincinnati, OH",5,11,6.0,1.0,2014-10-26,"Well that was a disaster.... Came in with several friends to enjoy a cold one to close out the weekend after the bengals game. The group orders, I got the 2 for 20 With my girlfriend, my fajitas were awful... A shitty sauce on top of it that they put on there using the methods of the Japanese in World War Two... A surprise attack. I sent it back 20 minutes later I got my replacement meal.. Mind you when there are 2 other customers so how does a ticket time take that long ? Bullshit. Now my second helping was awful as well chicken tasted like an old mans taint, and my tortillas were hard as a 14 year old boy seeing boobs for the first time come on folks.. The manager comes out to take discounts then we go to pay on the stupid little knock off tablets they have on the tables and it doesn't let us split the check up come on this is 2014!!! Our server was semi rude not to bad tho, the other worker kept staring at me like I killed her family what's up with that ? Anyways not coming back.. Bad. Look out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cincinnati-4,,,,,
11,Tabitha M.,"Maineville, OH",28,94,106.0,4.0,2015-02-01,"OK, I know that I'm probably in the minority here based on the aggregate rating for this place, but I had a pretty good experience here. I admit, I have not really been a Chili's fan.  My last experience at a location up in Dayton was not at all positive.  Mediocre food, not great service, etc.  Even on our way to this location, my husband was preemptively apologizing if it was bad, but we were headed to Fresh Thyme and were looking at places to eat nearby.  I am not a real fan of BW3s so this was next in line on Montgomery.   We went in on a Wednesday night and got seated right away.  I opened up the fairly sticky menu, and perused through the lighter options (trying my hardest to stick to the daily WW point allotment).  I settled on the 6oz. sirloin with the roasted garlic tomatoes & side salad.  The hubby opted for the Southern Smokehouse Burger.  It took a little longer than standard, but the food was brought to us as ordered and nice & hot. The food was good...really good for a standard mass-market chain.  The steak was cooked to the requested medium rare.  The sauce drizzled on top and the grilled avocado made a nice contrast to each other.  The roasted cherry tomatoes & garlic were yummy...I smiled and cackled at the hubby as I ate whole cloves of roasted garlic and told him any kisses that evening were going to be fragrant.  The mixed green fresco salad had some crumbled white cheese (queso fresco maybe?) and what I think was the honey-lime vinaigrette.  I ate everything on the plate.  The menu states the whole thing was 410 calories (calculated 11 WW points based on the nutrition stats on the restaurant's website) but I added a couple of points since the salad seemed that it may have been a bit heavier on the dressing and cheese than normal. As a bonus, they have these little terminals at every table.  Lots of games ($1.99 for unlimited play) for the kids that we did not make use of, nor did we ever need to click on the ""call server"" button, waters were filled promptly.  But it DID have this nifty pay at your table feature.  No trying to flag down your server and it even had a split the check button.  We were able to add the tip at the terminal as well, and I had the receipt e-mailed to me. So other than the sticky menus and the slightly slow food, it was quite an enjoyable experience.  And against my initial thoughts and reservations, I told the hubby that I would be more than happy to return.  I've got other lighter options to try, but I would be hard-pressed to order something other than the steak.  Yum!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cincinnati-4,,,,,
13,Michael L.,"Maineville, OH",0,2,2.0,1.0,2015-09-18,Friday night dinner at 7pm with no wait. Got a booth by the window.  It was our server's first day working and he was very attentive and did a great l until he forgot to check back right away after our food was served. We got the table side guacamole. It was very good. I got the chicken and shrimp fajitas. The chicken was overcooked and the shrimp seemed small.  Even when I told our server that the chicken was overcooked nothing was done to replace it.  My mom got the quesadilla salad. She said it was good but make sure you get the dressing on the side.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cincinnati-4,,,,,
15,Katie D.,"Mason, OH",1,7,,1.0,2015-10-13,We went there to eat the other day for our sons birthday. We got there around 5pm and they weren't too busy. We ordered our drinks and then ordered the kids food first since we didn't know what we wanted yet. 15 minutes later our waiter came back for our order. 5 minutes later he came back and asked us what we ordered for the kids cause he just scribbled it down and couldn't read it. We wanted there food first cause they were hungry. Our appetizer came out first. After waiting for about 35 minutes our food finally came out and unfortunately they brought it out all together. After we were done eating it took our waiter forever to bring us our check. We finally walked out of there at 6:15pm. There was a group of older women sitting near us and as we were leaving one of the ladies stopped us. She told us that we had ruined their meal and their whole dining experience because if our daughter screaming. She is 16 months old and she wasn't throwing a fit or crying....she was just making noise because she was hungry and getting impatient. If we would have had their food when it should have been there then it might have been different. By this point two other women had joined in and I felt ambushed. They told their waitress and the manager about it and wanted them to pretty much ask us to leave. And that we should have took her out. We only saw our waiter about 4 times the whole time we were there. And my husband over heard the waiter say in the kitchen that he was so glad that the family with the screaming child was finally leaving. I left there crying and very pissed off. This is a family restaurant and people need to understand that. If she would have been throwing a tantrum it would have been different. We will definitely not be going back there and felt very uncomfortable.And would not recommend anyone bringing a family in there with young kids.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cincinnati-4,,,,,
14,Beth B.,"Owensville, OH",2,16,1.0,3.0,2015-11-07,"Food was good and so was the service but this place is in serious need of a good cleaning. Dust caked in Windows around bar area floors were dirty, bathroom faucet was missing part of the handle floor was dirty base boards very grimy.

4,Tanya P.,"Cincinnati, OH",104,205,754.0,1.0,2017-01-04,"If only I'd read the reviews before visiting this terrible place. I was very excited when I looked at the menu and saw all the great deals they have to offer. The food is cheap. The servers don't care. Our server would only say, ""is there anything else I can do for you?""  We ordered the $10 special, three course. #1 Salad or nachos and chips.#2entree. #3 mini molten lava cake. I asked if I could change my side. He said, "" it only comes with what is on the picture."" So fries for everyone.  We asked for salads to be just romaine lettuce. The server said yes. Salads arrived in a tiny bowl, if you stir it too hard it will all be on the table since it's about three bites. They were a mix with iceberg included. I told the server we asked for romaine. He says ok and comes back with iceberg only salads. I asked again and informed him that I was now receiving iceberg only lettuce. He then said that's the only two choices. So I asked to receive the first choice again. At that point I was given a bowl of lettuce with a huge clump of iceberg and a couple pieces of green surrounding it with no toppings on it, just a bowl of lettuce. The salsa and chips were brought out by a woman who spilled the chips all around our table on the floor and onto our table just saying sorry and walks away. There's nothing but crumbs there we couldn't even eat the spicy ketchup salsa.The ribs are tough and sauceless. The fries were cold and hallow. We asked for bbq and fresh fries. They were hot and came in a cute little crate. The seasoning is randomly scattered here and there on the fries. The molten lava cake was good. It's a mini, so it's about fist size.  I don't recommend this place at all no matter how good the prices are. The pace needs a true cleaning.It just looks dirty everywhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cincinnati-4,,,,,

3,Andrew B.,"Mt Lookout, Cincinnati, OH",237,436,1207.0,4.0,2017-06-22,"I used to come to the Chili's all the time but it's been at least a couple years since I've been here. It's always been good here. The service is good, the restaurant's nice and clean, and the food is up to par with all of the other Chili's locations. This last time that we went was on a Friday night we were able to be seated right away. Our server was great.  I went with my go to Chili's meal which is the Buffalo Ranch Chicken sandwich. It's always really really good. The chicken is crisp and the sauce is nice and tangy, the ranch puts just the right amount of coolness to the heat.  And, as usual, we started out with the endless chips and salsa because they're just always amazing. They make the chips fresh every day and you can tell. But yeah, overall a very solid Chili's, very solid location, and a really good experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cincinnati-4,,,,,
9,Lisa L.,"Loveland, OH",121,246,196.0,4.0,2017-06-30,"I honestly was impressed with the food. I took my son for lunch and he really enjoyed the bacon ranch quesadilla with cilantro lime rice. It was a huge portion. He also got the chicken enchilada soup which he kept saying how amazing it tasted. I started off with the soup then ordered spicy shrimp taco, they're not spicy at all. They were good, I also otrdered double rice. We played games on their kiosk, we played LIFE, we always have a lot of fun. The bartender ( we sat in the bar area) was quick to refill our drinks and removing plates. The only downfall about sitting in the bar area are the tables. No matter how many times they clean the wood parts of the table they remained sticky. We moved to a high top table with tile on it and some wood still sticky but at least it wasn't the whole table! Overall, lunch was more than filling! Oh, my son also got a massive piece of strawberry drizzled cheesecake! It was delicious! Will come back for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cincinnati-4,,,,,
2,Rebecca M.,"Cincinnati, OH",40,142,416.0,2.0,2017-07-31,"Cheese bites, delicious. All day Sunday= happy hour prices. $3 curds and $4 select drinks. Curds come in an okay sized portion with awesome Cajun seasoning. They may be the only ones around that add the seasoning. Nice touch.  Beverages, way overpriced. $8 for a Rum Runner type drink with Strawberry Purée. Barely any alcohol at all. Tastes good but never again will I pay that amount for what I received.  Friends ordered food, it looked good but took forever to come out. The place was a total mess and the bathrooms were gross. Needed cleaned and stocked.  Too expensive and dirty for my taste.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-cincinnati-4,,,,,

This Chili's is a great Chili's! I came in with the family and got the whole deal. We got apps, entrees and deserts and every course was delicious! I asked to speak to the manager but our server said they were too busy at the time to come to the table but all I wanted to say was ""thanks for the tasty treats!"".  Wonderful service and food! I loved the spice and the flavor. I wanted to try the new nachos but figured we had all had enough and left a big tip for the server instead of getting the nachos to go.  Can't wait to come back!
