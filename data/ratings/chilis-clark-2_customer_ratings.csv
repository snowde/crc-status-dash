64,K R.,"Manhattan, NY",5,88,88.0,4.0,2012-01-30,"You know what you're getting when you go to Chili's. You have to be in the mood for the salty, bad-for-you menu, with oversized portions. Even most of the salads clock in at over 1,200 calories! I'm a fan of the black bean burger, chicken enchilada soup, nachos, the new Shiner Bock BBQ burger and the guiltless grilled chicken sandwich. A lot of people like the fries, but I think they're way too salty and usually opt for a different side like steamed brocolli. The ""To-Go"" service at this location is usually pretty good, but last time I picked up an order they forgot my drink and served me soups that had nothing in the broth (server must have skimmed the top of the soup). Overall, you get a good meal here, like I said though, you have to be in the mood for what they're serving. This location gets very busy at dinner time and parking can be a hassle.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-clark-2?start=60,2.384,2.384,2.384,2.384,2.384

The place does get very crowded on the weekends and for happy hour.  Actually, I am always shocked at how crowded the restaurant is at all times. Also, most of the food is deceivingly unhealthy for you.  Check out nutritional content before dining, some options that don't seem like they will hurt that much can really set you way back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-clark-2?start=40,2.088,2.088,2.088,2.088,2.088

78,Caroline E.,"Bradley Beach, NJ",120,2,,2.0,2012-11-25,"I haven't been at a Chili's in a long time and I've been to this particular location in the past.  This time around I wasn't impressed at all. I was there before choir rehearsal so we didn't have that much time and it was a week night.  We had to wait which it is what it is and I really didn't care much but was surprised.  But it also was after Sandy so people probably still were out of power and just wanting to get out.  So our time at the table chilling would be shorter.  Whatever. Since I'm trying to control swelling in old injuries, I decided to order the combo platter that they have and get the grilled salmon and shrimp with broccoli and rice.  Sounds healthy but no. The salmon had so much salt on it and the same for the rice and my poor broccoli was rotten.   I was horrified to see how degraded the vegetable was and how could they not see that, it was gray.  And they steamed it and put it on the plate and served it.  I had the server bring me more and digging into the bowl, I found more rotten broccoli.  When she came to clean our table I had a pile of rotten broccoli in front of me, do you think when I said again it still wasn't good that they'd knock something off the bill or offer me something else. They did not.   Both my dining partners ordered burgers.  The server did not ask them how they liked their beef and served both like hockey pucks.   Next time I'll pass and go to White Diamond or any other eatery in Clark before I go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-clark-2?start=60,2.024,2.024,2.024,2.024,2.024

We just laughed about it but it was definitely weird.  I also went not too long ago and it felt like the waiter was trying to kick us out the entire time. Very rushed.

It's not. I think people come for cheap drinks at the bar.  They've updated the decor, and it looks nice.  However, they need to do something about the quality of the food, and train their servers better.

6,Meghan S.,"Elizabeth, NJ",13,57,34.0,4.0,2015-11-02,I have never been a fan of Chilis but I've been coming here quite often.. I usually come here to get their chocolate chip cookie skillet which is amazing. And they also have amazing chicken fingers. I really can't say anything about their food because the few times I came here I got chicken fingers. The wings are really good. Their steak taste like a normal steak nothing fancy. And the cookie skillet.. The service is ok. But the only thing I don't like is I went there once around 11 and I ordered fries and they were gross. They were closing in a few so they must of gave me the last of their fries before they change the oil the next day so I wouldn't come here late at night. I would come earlier so the food taste better.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-clark-2?start=20,2.24,2.24,2.24,2.576,2.24

They arrived after the appetizers. This was probably due in part because we were seated right by the kitchen and whatever antics were going on in the kitchen, it was very loud and unprofessional. Furthermore, There was a gathering of female servers crowded around one male server by our table and the kitchen, spewing everything unprofessional and acting like a know-it-all. It disrupted the quiet dinner I was having. The food I ordered was not prepared properly. I asked for the dressing to be on the side for my salad and and was served with dressing on the salad. I would have stayed and ordered another drink or two, but the loud sounds coming from the kitchen and having to listen to a know-it-all server spew BS rather than worry about his tables made my experience bad.

It took 2 1/2 hours one day just to eat lunch with slow service even though the place was 30% full. The next time we said we would not go back because of sub-par quality. Finally went again after a few years and the tacos my wife had were cold with stale shells/ tortillas. The burger bites I had tasted like they were under a heat light for hours, dry and the meat was well done although I requested medium. I also was given a small amount of fries that literally cost would cost them .25 more to give me a fair amount. The only thing edible that night were the chips and salsa.
