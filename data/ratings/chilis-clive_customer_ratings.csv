22,Jessica H.,"Roberts, WI",102,83,10.0,3.0,2012-01-22,"2 for 1 Margaritas and Blue Moons?!? Chilis you have my attention. Sat in the bar during the Giants vs 49ers game and it was DEAD, this leads me to believe this is not one of the choicest establishments in West Des Moines. We shared the 2 for $20 appetizer and entree meal. Chips and Salsa, Honey-Chipolte Chicken Crispers, and Chicken Fajitas. It was all really good in fact better than other Chilis I have ate at. Throw in those 2 for 1's and we had a very good experience",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-clive?start=20,,,,,
8,Nathan B.,"Churdan, IA",25,54,81.0,5.0,2014-05-07,"I have been to this Chili's many times, and have never had a bad experience!  My most recent visit (back in January 2014) was no different!  My go to is the Grilled Shrimp Tacos with rice.  Awesome every time!  My partner gets different things each visit, and he's usually satisfied.   My only complaint is that I wish they'd build a third Chili's in downtown Des Moines or on the South Side, as they need more restaurants!  I suggest you ignore Justin B.'s review, as I have never seen that kind of behavior here, but that WAS six years ago, mind you. To the foodies who eat local only: Why are you even reading this when you do nothing but knock the chain restaurants?  Chili's is a chain, I'm well aware of it, and yes I dine at places like Centro and Mezzodi's, too!  So don't call me a guy with bland taste just because I eat at Chili's...perhaps it's you who needs to do that to get an ego boost.  End rant. Bottom Line: EAT AT THIS CHILI'S!  YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-clive,,,,,
19,Tony E.,"Alpharetta, GA",16,43,1.0,2.0,2014-11-18,"Food is no different than any chili's in the country. What sets this chili's apart from others is the service, or shall we say,  lack thereof. .  Seemed to be a chore to take the time to wait on people.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-clive,,,,,
17,Michael C.,"Des Moines, IA",0,18,,2.0,2014-12-12,"Food is normally pretty good. Like the new items. I walked in today though for lunch and sat down at a filthy table. The server ""cleaned"" it and then I changed seats. As soon as I changed seats he asked if I was ready to order. I had been in there for a total of 3mins. I guess it's to be expected for a chain restaurant. As always the tip will reflect.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-clive,,,,,
18,Linda K.,"Kansas City, MO",26,18,9.0,1.0,2014-12-26,57 minutes we waited for the food. Yes 57 minutes. Then all of the five meals were really bad. Cold ribs burnt steaks.  The servers were all upset as to what was going on in the kitchen. The manager did comp our meal which was nice. Everyone around us were experiencing the same thing. Where is Gordon Ramsey when we need him. If we lived local we could tolerate this but we are on a road trip and didn't have two hours for lunch. We made sure to take care of the server because she was doing the best she could.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-clive,,,,,
14,Mariana L.,"Saint Paul, MN",0,8,30.0,4.0,2015-01-01,"The California Chicken Flatbread was very tasty! It was a nice portion for more than one person. My husband had the fajitas with steak, chicken and shrimp. He loved it and the rice and beans too! Yet, he wasn't very happy with the portion size. He felt it was way too small. It pretty much seemed like an appetizer. However, the waiter was very friendly and made sure we were well taken care of.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-clive,,,,,
16,Tony J.,"Olathe, KS",0,32,1.0,2.0,2015-05-17,"I have eaten in several chilis in different states. This one is not one of the better ones. The place was clean and tidy, but the staff was slow. We had to wait several minutes before we saw anyone to seat us. Our watress was nice enough, but it took a while for her to even stop by  and get our drink orders in.  Overall the wait time for how many people were here was just horrible. My wife had tostadas and enjoyed them greatly. I had the make your own fajita. Mine was ok but will not order it again, was not worth my  time when I can get better back home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-clive,,,,,
21,Sarah M.,"Simsbury, CT",0,7,,4.0,2015-06-14,Sat in the bar. Bartender was great and food was good. Also had the El Presidente Margarita was very good!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-clive?start=20,,,,,
10,Evin J.,"Madison, WI",51,112,3.0,3.0,2015-07-14,"Stopped in alone for a quick dinner during a work trip. Sat at the bar and ordered a drink. Would have quickly ordered an entree but bartender disappeared in the back for the next ten minutes. Food was good and came out fast, once I ordered. Finished and waited for my check another 10 minutes because the bartender was on a phone call them bs'ing with the staff in the kitchen. Three starts due to lack of attention. She was nice but not a great server.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-clive,,,,,
15,Sylvia D.,"West Des Moines, IA",11,73,,5.0,2015-08-05,"I'm giving Chili's a five star review because they make the very, very best buffalo chicken salad you can find anywhere.   Its absolutely perfect.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-clive,,,,,
11,Jonny N.,"Des Moines, IA",116,7,1.0,2.0,2015-12-10,"Good food but this chills has terrible customer service. Very slow, and waiter seem so out of it. We could barely understand what he was saying because he spoke so fast and slurred his words. Place needs to train their workers on customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-clive,,,,,
20,Jodi A.,"Plymouth, MI",1,7,,1.0,2016-03-12,Loaded boneless wings were great unfortunately that was the only good thing about my dining experience. Had to talk to the manager to find out what happened to our order after waiting for entrees to arrive after everyone in our area had their food and we came in before them. No explanation for why we didn't get our food and took another 20 minutes to get. By this time requested it to go. Had two different quesadillas and a bacon cheese burger. None were anything to brag about. No spice to the quesadillas didn't get any sour cream or Pico DE gallo. Had a strange tasting salad and chili that weren't ordered. Will not be returning. Worst service ever,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-clive?start=20,,,,,
7,Dave T.,"Urbandale, IA",129,314,64.0,1.0,2016-03-20,"Last night my wife wanted chili's so we called and ordered take out. We both got the Cajun pasta she got it with chicken and I got with shrimp- Tasted like the smell of band aides!! Pasta was in a nasty sauce tasted as if they nuked frozen pasta was covered in salt should be named salt pasta!!  Was very disgusting my shrimp in my pasta was luke warm at best. The wife also tried the southwestern eggrolls, smelled like armpits was tough she almost broke a tooth. Again another frozen dish they nuked how revolting. Also got the ribeye- was more like a 6 oz minute steak as rough as it was now the mashed taters were not bad with bacon but hard to not mess that up a 5 year old can make mashed taters with drizzled cheese and bacon bits. The volcano brownie was the best but hard the screw up a desert that a brownie and ice cream with chocolate syrup. All in all was AWFUL!! yes and we paid $75 Dollars for a crappy meal that 90% of it was thrown in the trash!! I WILL NEVER EVER EAT THE SHIT AGAIN...... They need to hire a real chef not part time cooks as no way they tasted that shit talk about low class and trashy..Safe your money eat MCdonalds worm bedding before giving those basterds a dime just GROSS.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-clive,,,,,
13,Nathan R.,"Clive, IA",15,1,,5.0,2016-04-04,Food is always great. We come more for the service. Johnny is one of the best waiters we have experienced and is always willing to make the experience better if needed.   Always a good time out here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-clive,,,,,
12,Annemarie C.,"Queensbury, NY",0,14,1.0,4.0,2016-08-07,Cadan was a terrific server! We had the bottomless soup and salad! Favorite soup was southwest chicken. Salads were made fresh and crisp.  I love Chilis!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-clive,,,,,
9,John M.,"Des Moines, IA",1,2,,1.0,2017-02-17,"I will never recommend a place that steals property from customers, especially when the management seems to condone this abhorrent behavior. I made the huge mistake of leaving my Oakley custom, polarized aviators on the table when we left. Called as soon as I realized my mistake and asked if they were found. As soon as I explained the situation, the manager acted like he didn't understand me and no longer spoke English. I usually don't point fingers but either the waitress with attitude or the guy slowly bussing tables took them, since they were the only people ever in that section. Neither one would surprise me since the busser was obviously a slacker and the waitress was one of those types who acted like we were putting her out for coming into the restaurant she worked at. My bad. Slow service, mediocre food, thievery of personal items, and management that covers for criminal behavior. Just wow. I usually keep track of my belongings and take care of my property but I couldn't get out of there fast enough and was absolutely distracted by the attitude of the waitress. My fault for forgetting such an expensive item on the table but a decent human being wouldn't keep those for themselves. Shame on you, Chili's. I wouldn't come back even if they gave me a gift card for $350 to compensate for my stolen sunglasses. Mad at myself for such a stupid, yet costly mistake and disgusted with Chili's. -5 stars if that were possible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-clive,,,,,
6,Nicole R.,"Scottsdale, AZ",241,8,,5.0,2017-05-07,Stopped in for lunch on our way to Chicago during a roadtrip. Our server Parker quickly came to our table to greet us and immediately brought our drinks. He seemed a little busy with a full selection but attended very well to us throughout dealing with many others! He accommodated all of our requests and was very knowledgeable about the specials going on. Have never been to an Iowa Chili's before but I would come back because of Parker.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-clive,,,,,
4,Cliff And Judy R.,"West Des Moines, IA",1,116,,2.0,2017-05-13,The waiters and waitresses at this location are usually great and this review in no way reflects on them. The food at this location is way below the quality you normally get! The portions are cut down (Iowa is the only state I have ever seen do this at chains restaurants but I am sure the managers are making no more money by cheating people so I don't know why they do it) and normally you are getting 30%-40% less for the same price! I have taken pictures of the chicken fingers and sent them to the home office and I suggest you do the same (the chicken fingers are half the size they are in Austin Texas and most likely they are cutting them in half)!!!! We lost one of the only T.G.I. Fridays to ever close in the U.S. and it looks like Chillis is going the same way!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-clive,,,,,
3,Tiana G.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,6.0,2.0,2017-06-13,"I bought a Santa Fe Chicken Salad to go (around 9:30/9:45pm) went back to my room and noticed I had a friend inside waiting for. They closed at 10pm, I called around 10:30 and was able to speak to a manager (Steven) he was really nice however was only interested in giving me gift certificates because he balances the books already. I don't eat at Chili's , did so out of convenience and will never eat there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-clive,,,,,
5,Sally J.,"Des Moines, IA",0,29,,1.0,2017-06-18,"Usually, when looking for a quick bite we go to Baker's Square, but it was completely full (aka not quick), so we went down the road to Chili's. The parking lot was almost empty, and that should've been my first clue. If Baker's Square and the mexican restaurant next door are both full up and you have maybe 10 customers, that's a problem. The food was not good. It wasn't cooked properly, and I ended up getting sick later. The service was the worst though. I am usually a very generous tipper, 20% or more, but I didn't even want to leave a tip. We sat there with empty cups a majority of our meal, and the waiter didn't check on us until we were almost done eating, which is way too late to correct the issue with the food. The moral of the story, as a chain restaurant, you have to be on your game and Chili's just isn't.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-clive,,,,,
1,Rachel L.,"West Des Moines, IA",5,174,235.0,4.0,2017-07-29,"First time at a Chili's. This place is near an Applebee's and a Mexican restaurant. Which could be the reason why not that many people were here. The customers who were here seemed to be regulars. I ordered a platter that included 3 apps which were fries, chicken strips, and 2 hamburger sliders. All were very tasty. The waitress we had was pretty nice and overall the restaurant was clean.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-clive,,,,,
2,Stephanie K.,"Waukee, IA",46,124,169.0,5.0,2017-08-01,"Fabulous server last night when my boyfriend and I went out for dinner! Very attentive and our drinks were always full, can't beat that! I had the big bite sliders and he had the bottomless soup and salad, which also came with chips and salsa. My sliders were very flavorful and cheesy. My BF said the salsa was the perfect amount of spicy. For dessert we finished off with their Oreo molten lava cake with ice cream. I mean... melt in your mouth delicious",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-clive,,,,,
0,Sheena H.,"Des Moines, IA",28,32,68.0,4.0,2017-08-27,I love this chain!  Went for lunch today with the family. It's a very family friendly atmosphere and there seems to be something for everyone. My son enjoys being able to play games in their table kiosks which is nice so adults can have conversation and not feel rushed when eating.  The food was great. I tried the sunrise burger with the egg on it. Definitely not date food!!!  It was the messiest burger I've ever eaten!  I have stuff dripping from all my fingers and I'm sure my face. But it was delicious!  The egg could have been cooked a tad longer though.  My mom got the prime rib fajitas. She special orders everything and they actually got it right!  The prime rib was melt in your mouth yummy! My only complaint was the service was a little off. We couldn't get a straw to save our lives and it seemed like our waitress was super busy across the restaurant. But she was extremely friendly and I enjoyed our lunch.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-clive,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88
