21,Goose R.,"Columbus, OH",119,182,187.0,1.0,2012-12-28,"The bartender is a racist bastard. I used to go here almost once a week to have beers and appetizers. Not anymore. I'm from Mexico and Wednesday Dec 26th 2012, went there with a high school friend that I have not seen in ages. We started talking in Spanish and maybe that was not OK with the bartender. After struggling to have his attention, we ordered a couple of beers, he said: Just this 1 round right? Like he was suggesting it. I said: I don't know, we'll see. When my friend finished his drink, he asked for another one. The bartender blatantly ignored us, not only that, he refilled another costumer and he was not even asking. He even turn his back on us! Literally his back on us. I was mad and ask for the check and left. I'm not coming back there ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-collierville?start=20,,,,,
23,Tyler K.,"Brentwood, TN",2,1,,1.0,2012-12-31,"This was a horrible experience. A group of friends and I sat down at 4 o'clock and was greeted immediately by a waiter. So far so good. She took our order and put it in right away. So we proceeded to wait for 30 minutes without the server checking in on us. So at 4:30, everyone at the table got their food except me. It was at thirty minutes I got my cup of soup. The waitress apologizes and says it won't be much longer on my MAC N CHEEZE! That's all I ordered. Soup and Mac n cheese. But she was wrong. It came out at 4:45 from the manager. He was rude and dismissive of my complaints. I said I didn't feel like I should have to pay for my meal l. He proceeded to agree. When the waitress brought our bill at 4:50 she handed me a bill for my soup. My cup of soup that took 30 minutes to receive. She said the manager wouldn't take off the soup. I corrected her saying no, he will take it off, I'm not paying for it. At 5:10 we left after the rest of my party got their change. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE WANTING A NICE DINING EXPERIENCE.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-collierville?start=20,,,,,

18,Melanie L.,"Collierville, TN",37,125,29.0,2.0,2014-05-15,Do not attempt To Go on a weekend. The parking lot is a mess and the little cubby with the to go register is chaos.  I ordered online and thought it would be easy like Carabbas a quick in and out grab. Instead the wait was 30 min past my pick up time the food was cold they forgot the guacamole and salsa which I paid extra for and I had to climb over people to let the cashier know who I was and why I was there.  I waited right next to the door then in the bar at an empty chair while my food was being ready the bartender served the gentleman right next to me over and over but did not make eye contact with me of ask me if I wanted a drink .  At a minimum I would've ordered a fruity drink and left a generous tip. Was never given the chance.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-collierville,,,,,
5,Samantha B.,"Collierville, TN",217,763,2516.0,4.0,2014-07-12,"In general I enjoy coming here. Service and food can be off sometimes but it happens. I admit this location isn't as good as the one near the University of Memphis (IMHO) but it's still good. The queso is an all-time favorite in that we get it pretty much every time we come here. The buffalo wings are also amazing and addicting; we get them pretty often (hubby has come for the sole purpose of getting them to-go before because he got hooked). The Margarita Chicken is a fav of mine as well as the Monterey Chicken. I got a little tired of them both so I have been trying different things now. My new fav is the Green Chile Chicken Enchilada- I hope they keep it!  The ribs are either great or not. So far I didn't like the Dr. Pepper ones but I loved the original and the baby back ribs. I need to remember to get more from here! Another favorite of mine here are the quesadillas. They are just so good! The bonesless wings are also pretty amazeballs and the two flavors I have tried have both been awesome. The Hot Fiery Pepper was actually a little sweet so hubby didn't like it but he loves the Buffalo sauce.  To Try:  Margherita Flatbread without add ons Southwestern Eggrolls Ancho Salmon Chipotlee Chicken Fresh Mex Bowl Love: - Baby Back Ribs - Boneless Buffalo Wings: Buffalo Sauce, Hot Fiery Pepper Sauce - Bottomless Raspberry Lemonade - Fries - Green Chile Chicken Enchilada  - Half Rack Ribs Original - Margarita Grilled Chicken  - Monterey Chicken  - Onion Rings - Quesadillas Bacon Ranch Chicken  - Raspberry Coronarita (no longer make) - Skillet Queso and Chips - Strawberry Lemonade - Tito's Punch  - Watermelon Lemonade Like:  - Broccoli - Fries - Jalapeño-Cheddar Smoked Sausage - Margherita Flatbread (with chicken, avocado, and bacon) - Skillet Toffee Fudge Brownie - Spicy Pasilla Chile Chicken  - Texas-Size Dry Rub Baby Back Ribs - White Spinach Queso Ok:  - Cajun Chicken Pasta  - Dr. Pepper Half Rack Ribs - French Fries - Fried Cheese - Guacamole Burger - Loaded Mashed Potatoes - Skillet Smoked Potato Wedges - Smoked Chicken Quesadillas  Eh:  - Carnitas Tacos - Dry Rub Ribs - Enchilada Soup (hubby liked) - Fajitas (chicken and carnitas) - Jack and Coke - Mango-Chile Chicken  - Quinoa and Wheatberry Blend - Ranchero Chicken Tacos - Sour Cream Chicken Enchiladas - Tableside Guacamole - Texas Cheese Fries",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-collierville,,,,,
7,Barrett O.,"Collierville, TN",123,122,611.0,4.0,2014-07-12,"They have new cool devices on the table called Ziosks  for reordering drinks and looking at specials. Heads up , after happy hour draft beers are 6 bucks each. Bottles are 4 something,  weird and not shown on menu. They had added full blown chicken and pork fajitas to their two for 20 menu, which also includes 9 inch pepperoni pizxa, bacon ranch chicken quesadillas,  classic bacon burger, half rack ribs with fries, mango-chile tilapia, mango-chile chicken, margarita grilled chicken, grilled chicken salad, 6 Oz classic sirloin, original chicken crispers, crispy chicken crispers, crispy honry-chipotle chicken crispers and cajun chicken pasta. Chose two of those and share an appetizer for 20 bucks, not bad. Food was good. Service was very good with Steven at the bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-collierville,,,,,
13,Joel B.,"Collierville, TN",18,125,58.0,4.0,2014-07-12,I like this place in general. My favorite appetizers are the queso and the boneless buffalo wings (I have gone to get just them before).  I think my favorite thing to get here is the Margarita Chicken. I also like the Chicken Enchilada Soup and the Raspberry Lemonade.  I didn't like the dry rub ribs as they were dry inside instead of just outside.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-collierville,,,,,
19,Marsha S.,"Collierville, TN",0,4,1.0,5.0,2014-07-13,"Enjoying wings, fajitas and beers with friends!!! Great local bar/restaurant. We're regulars here and it's always a good time!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-collierville,,,,,
17,Hannah S.,"Collierville, TN",1,9,,2.0,2014-11-08,"Since being under new management, this place has gone downhill. Server was nice and efficient; however, the good was terrible. Second time coming and will not go back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-collierville,,,,,
15,Amber M.,"Memphis, TN",79,210,34.0,1.0,2014-11-24,"Chili's as a chain needs to do a sweep and fix some things. I haven't been to a thoroughly decent location in a while but this one takes the cake. Dirty glasses, dirty silverware, horribly slow service, and cold food, just in the one location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-collierville,,,,,
22,Tammy H.,"Germantown, TN",0,3,,1.0,2015-03-10,"Last Saturday my family decided to go to this location.  The service was horrible.  Our waiter was busy with a table of about eight.  We were waiting on our drink and appetizer.  When he looked over my husband crooked his two fingers to request he come back to our table.  The waiter was rude. Told us he did not appreciate my husband's movement. I said "" you have a problem with that?""  He said, ""yes, it was like you were summoning me, and I don't like that.""  Imagine our surprise.  Obviously he is not in the right line of work, nor is he customer focused. I asked for his name and requested to see the Mgr.  Guess what?  We explained the situation with the mgr.  We were flabbergasted when he said, "" mmm, so what do you want me to do about it?""  Really???!!  He is obviously not in the right position as a Manager either.  Mouths wide open we left without ordering dinner.  We will never go to this location again and are spreading the word.  The waiter's name began with an A.  So make sure to ""cater"" to him if you want him to ""wait"" on you!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-collierville?start=20,,,,,
14,Emily R.,"Germantown, TN",40,253,623.0,4.0,2015-03-12,I had the chicken and cheese nachos. They came out hot and fresh . The server was fast and friendly. I really like the new ziosk self check out system. I find it to be very efficient. This is a great place for a quick inexpensive casual neighborhood lunch . They have a very diverse menu.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-collierville,,,,,
16,Bob B.,"Southaven, MS",43,53,26.0,4.0,2015-03-18,"Been to this one 2 or 3 times because we have family who live in Collierville. I'm a big fan of Chili's, especially for the taste of their food and I can't get enough of their chips. We enjoy the 2 for $20 special. Last time, we took our granddaughter with us and she enjoyed herself and the server was very accomodating.  We are coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-collierville,,,,,
6,Destiny L.,"Nashville, TN",99,22,12.0,1.0,2016-04-23,"Update: still waiting.  It's been a fortnight. Ok that's dramatic. It's been another 15 minutes. An hour for Mac and cheese. Also, I heard the chef say the F word so I'm not sure what's going on back there. It's possible I'm being punk'd. Ashton, where are you?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-collierville,,,,,
11,Mike W.,"Collierville, TN",0,2,,5.0,2016-08-02,"Last minute decision to grab a bite to eat before a stage show---awesome choice.  Have eaten here before and it was good, but things are changing for the better. Warmly greeted and immediately escorted to a booth.  Service was friendly, very attentive and professional.  Regional manager stopped by table as did the store general manager and the kitchen manager...gotta love that.  I had the fish tacos and my wife chose the hamburger with an egg on top...both cooked to perfection and extremely tasty.   The couple with us...true foodies that eat out a lot, raved about their meals. Excellent...recommend it highly...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-collierville,,,,,
9,Crystal V.,"Olive Branch, MS",0,9,4.0,1.0,2016-08-23,We were seated right after coming in. They told us our waiter would be out shortly. We waited an hour. A WHOLE HOUR. And nobody came. It was horrible. Especially because my toddler was starting to get hangry. Do not go here. Horrible business. This happened twice may I add. The second time we decided to give it another go and we entered and were never seated.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-collierville,,,,,
8,Wendy W.,"Collierville, TN",1,19,7.0,4.0,2016-11-06,My husband and I always get the 2 for $20 plus extra entrée  (sometimes a extra app). It's just to good of a deal not to get. Well on to the food. The food is okay. My sirloin last week was great medium and juicy. The sirloin I had about a month ago wasn't as good. I always order cookie with ice cream. Well the ice creme I was given on this visit was small.  I think the ice creme was frozen to hard for them to get out. It looked like they scraped it out and tried to piece it together. But overall this restaurant is normal. Not great Not Bad just okay,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-collierville,,,,,
12,Pam L.,"Fisherville, TN",2,11,8.0,1.0,2016-11-12,"After years of ""boycotting"" this location for bad service, I was drawn back by the current $10 Three for Me promotion. I decided to go late afternoon in order to avoid the dinner rush and hopefully receive better service. We placed our simple order and promptly received chip/salsa and our salad. I requested a Diet Coke in a to-go cup but it came out in a small child sized cup. Of course it was quickly empty so I requested a refill. In meantime, fajitas arrived but still no drink. Waited approx 15 min and still no drink. Finally get waiters attn and his curt response to ANOTHER request was ""yeah"". Finished the fajitas and sat forever waiting for the dessert which is part of the deal. Finally waiter shows again asking if we wanted the dessert and walks away without clearing the table. Manager arrives with dessert and I explain how horrible experience has been. Has the nerve to say that particular waiter was usually very good and that he was probably tired! Ok, in fairness, I don't expect a fine dining experience from a Chili's deal but come on! The food was decent but the place was not crowded and it was a straight-forward order. There was ZERO effort to ensure we would even want to come back. Not sure which was more disappointing, the server or the manager!! Needless to say, we will NOT be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-collierville,,,,,
1,Kristina M.,"Fayetteville, GA",168,314,2146.0,4.0,2017-01-06,"I haven't been to this location so I figure we give it a try.  My husband and I went around 8:00 on a weekend and it was pretty empty. We were kindly greeted as we entered and seat quickly. We looked over the menu and I opted to order the half texas cheese fries for appetizers minus the jalapeños (not a big fan of them). For entree I ordered the chicken bacon quesadillas which was delicious. My husband ordered the mixed steak and chicken fajitas which a side of rice and beans. For drink I ordered the strawberry lemonade and liked the flavor.  All in all, we enjoyed our meal and service was good. No complaints here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-collierville,,,,,
10,Carl H.,"Collierville, TN",2,46,15.0,4.0,2017-04-14,I was pleasently surprised with the service I recently received at Chilies.  My medium steak held a light pink middle.  The brocklee did not fall apart and was not crunchy.  I will return for another meal.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-collierville,,,,,
4,Amy S.,"Collierville, TN",0,7,,5.0,2017-10-04,"Dined at Chili's tonight with husband and had a great experience as usual. Bartender was awesome (Heather)  and she was very attentive. Love the Texas cheese fries, my favorite. Ask for extra cheese bc everything taste better with more cheese.  My old-timer cheese burger was cooked perfect and black beans never disappoint. The pickles are house made and taste amazing!! Husband had steak and shrimp fajitas, delicious. Food timing was a bit slow but the restaurant was busy when we placed our order so worth the extra wait for delicious  food.  We love  Manager Kris! She knows what true hospitality means and will do whatever she can to make your dining experience perfect. We will be back soon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-collierville,,,,,
2,Sandra F.,"Olive Branch, MS",2,49,98.0,5.0,2017-10-22,"Came in for a late lunch. Not too crowded. Ordered skillet queso which came out quick, which was good because I was starving! Then had a steak with avocado that came with a wonderful salad. I'm sorry I don't know the name of it because it's definitely worth ordering. Our waitress, Natalie, recommended it. She was awesome, by the way. Come in, get the avocado steak and ask for her.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-collierville,,,,,
