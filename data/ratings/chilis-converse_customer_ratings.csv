5,Joe N.,"San Antonio, TX",8,63,6.0,1.0,2012-01-24,"So my Mom lives off of FM 78 so we decided to stop at this Chilis instead of going to the Forum for dinner. BIG MISTAKE. We started off poorly right from the moment we walked in the front door. The Host greeted us and said he was going to get a table together and be right back. He gave me one of the buzzers so I should have known better but nearly 15 minutes later we still had not sit down.  Once we finally got to sit down the host told us he would be back to take our drink orders and he never returned. A few minutes later our waiter showed up and introduced himself and also pointed out another gentleman who could help us if we needed anything. We never saw the second guy again...seriously just disappeared. He takes our drink orders and we wait...and wait...and wait. FINALLY he brings our drinks and takes our orders. We asked for Chips and Salsa while we waited for our food and he disappears to go find them (meanwhile he didnt bring any straws for my kids's drinks which we had to ask him for twice). When he brings the chips and salsa the chips look like what you get at the bottom of the bag, all crushed up and actually a very small serving. Being that there are 3 adults and 2 children eating we blow through the chips in short order and sit back to wait for our food. Meanwhile we don't see our server again for almost 20 minutes. He comes back and says he'd be bringing more chips. Another 20 minutes go by and he walks by and realizes he's forgotten. He disappears and brings the chips. We are rapidly approaching an HOUR of waiting for our food and I look around and realize that this restaurant is literally half empty. I begin wondering how much longer we'd have to wait. He comes by and says that the kids' food is ready and he can bring it but ours is not ready. Meanwhile my kids are out of control because they are bored and hungry so I accidentally snap at him to bring the damn food. He does and my kids start eating but not before I asked him for another spoon for one of my boys. It would be nearly the end of the meal before I had to remind him about it again otherwise we would have never seen it. About 10 minutes later he brings out our food and we begin to eat. Now meanwhile we have two chip bowls on our table plus the empty salsa bowl. He doesn't retrieve a single one and leaves us to fend for ourselves to find the necessary room to eat. At some point I look up and realize that nearly EVERY glass on the table is empty. No waiter to be seen.  All in all the food wasnt bad. We begin finishing eating and I hope he comes to take some of the plates since we are literally piling them on top of each other to make room. He comes by and has the audacity to drop off the check and walk away.  The next time he comes by I give him my CC and I look over my right shoulder. The table to my right has the manager there and they are complaining about nearly all the same things we just went through. About this time the waiter comes back and I politely show him the error of his ways. I write CRAPPY SERVICE on the receipt and zero out the tip amount and hand it to him so he can see it. We pack our things and walk out the door having lost over an hour and a half to the place in total. Still the restaurant is no more than half full. I have had some crappy servers before but this guy took the cake. I don't know if he was new (though he didnt seem like it) or if he just didn't care but I'll never, ever, EVER go back to this place. I could not believe what a complete and utter disappointment this place was. My only regret was paying full price for my meal but the manager seemed to have his hands full with the other complaining table to my right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-converse?start=20,1.5720000000000003,1.5720000000000003,1.5720000000000003,1.5720000000000003,1.5720000000000003

I work in the Converse area and have somewhat limited lunch choices to what I am accustomed to having near home. It's Chili's so I know what to expect with their food, but I don't expect to get sick off the food. I've had two entrees here(both involving chicken) and got ill each time.

11,Joell C.,"Converse, TX",2,8,4.0,1.0,2014-06-03,"It is so disappointing that Chili's in Converse has such poor customer service, because the food is good! No matter how busy or slow,  the service is always bad and now that they have those new checkout things on the table the service is worse. We went in there yesterday around 7:30 pm they were fairly busy, and  they sat us in the bar. The server took ten minutes before she even came to the table to greet us. She only had one table besides us. I watched in amazement as she stood at the table behind us watching a video on the customers phone while we sat waiting for her to come to the table. Finally after I stared at her for like 7 minutes, she comes and takes our drink order my husband and I both ordered draft beers. We waited and waited at least 15 minutes as I looked over to see our beers  just sitting there, waiting for her to pick them up when she finally did the beers were warm. YUCK warm beer !  We order 2 for 20 meal so it came with an appretizer,  texas cheese fries. Needless to say it took another 15 minutes as she was passing by,  I asked our server how much longer she said oh it shouldn't be much longer next thing I know she comes right out with them you could tell they had been sitting in the window awhile, the only thing good was our main dishes. The server didnt even bother to come back to our table was the food was serveed. The service never gets better here just keeps getting worse and worse we used to come here every friday night because we live around the corner but I think we are just about to give up on this Chili's!! I keep hoping they'll improve but they never do, so I think we are done with this restaurant. The wait staff is slow and barely competent. I didn't even bother to complain to management, seems pointless because in the past we have complained and nothing has changed. Couldn't wait to pay and get out of there. So sad because they have upgrade the outside of the the place and inside.

28,Laura M.,"Clovis, NM",29,60,174.0,1.0,2014-11-20,"Dear chili's - get rid of computers and bring back servers! Against the warnings of terribly slow service, my family and I arrived at this chili's at 5pm on a Thursday. It took nearly 4 minutes for anyone to acknowledge our presence and sit us, which folks in the food service industry know is way too long. (I was a server for 5 years) There was one other table in the dining area and two in the bar area. 3 servers made eye contact but none offered to seat us.  Once we were seated it was another 3-4 minutes before our waitress to take our drink order. Again, it's 5 pm and no one was there. Luckily we placed our daughters order as soon as we sat down because it was nearly an hour for our food to arrive. Our food was the correct temperature and was very tasty.  This is a common trend with chili's. The cut back of servers is blatantly obvious as the reliance on the tabletop computers have replaced good old fashion service. I've tried the chili's in the forum and 3009-same service speed. Sorry chili's the food was delish but not worth an hour wait in an uncrowded restaurant.

Nearly instant regret.  This place was just awfulll. Waitress came by for our drink orders,  water and a lemonade, we were brought tea and a sprite?  She slid them on the table so quickly we couldn't even get her attention to correct it.  Took about five minutes to flag her down and another five minutes for her to bring the correct drinks out at which point she finally took our orders.  I ordered the smoked bbq wings and a cup of loaded baked potato soup, my mother ordered the endless enchiladas they had on special.  The soup was good, nothing extraordinary.  The wings were itty bitty and barely had any meat to them,  I wasn't super hungry so this wasn't so upsetting, just something to keep in mind.  The enchiladas were the worsttt. We had requested the sides be substituted but of course staying true to preceeding service,  the wrong sides came out with the enchilada entree. Our waitress seemed irritated when we pointed it out, and we're rational people,  there are times when it is the kitchen's fault when orders come out wrong,  but c'mon. You had to look at the plate to bring it out, should've noticed something was wrong. She took it back, brought out the corrected order, and the tortillas on the enchildas were hard as a rockand ridiculously difficult to cut into.  We flagged down a manager who had been milling around amongst the four other slow moving waitstaff and complained about the entree. He offered no excuse or even a hint of sympathy, just an ""oh you don't like it? Uh. We can bring a different entree out."" But we just decided to cut our losses and bail.

Today, against my best judgement I decided to order online and give the restaurant one last chance. My order was supposed to be ready at 6:31 pm. I arrived at 6:35.

Unfortunately, the last 2 visits have been so subpar that it's time to accept the reality that traveling an extra 5 miles may be worth it.  1. I'm allergic to onion which I make known upon arrival at any and every restaurant.  I understand the occasional slip where a server may not have realized onion was involved in a dish but... there was Pico de gallo on 2 of 3 dishes presented AFTER specifying my allergy. It then took so long to get a ""replacement "" order of beans and condiments, without onions, that my rice and entrée were cold.  2. It took over 35 minutes to receive an order of fajitas, at the empty bar, for unknown reasons. What's more upsetting is that the 2 patrons that did arrive after us...recieved and completed their meals (of fried chicken strips) before we even got our food.  3. The entire staff was un-attentive, spent more time talking in the kitchen and was very unprofessional. At one point, a server climbed on the chair next to me to reach over the bar instead of walking around. This is not only against safety measures but was not a pleasant sight to have in front of me. We've avoided this locations for months after walking out due to poor service and sadly won't be returning.

After asking the server about my drink 30 minutes later she said she would check on it. Ten minutes later she asked if it was frozen or on the rocks. That let me know for sure that it was not made. I finally received my drink 50 minutes after I placed the order and half way through dinner and it was not correct. I drank it anyway. The server apologized for the delay, but did not offer to compensate for the inconvenience. When I was ready to pay, I wanted to use the ziosk to receive points and submit a survey for the terrible service I endured. Unfortunately, a kid at another table was playing a game on the one that belonged to my table and accrued charges for those games on my bill. I informed the server and instead of taking the charges off she split the check for the difference.  This would not have been a problem if I was alone, however, I wanted to split the check with my friend and because she already used that option I was unable to do so.

Now I need one and should have ordered one with my lunch fajitas.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-converse,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08

25,Alyssa C.,"Schertz, TX",0,9,12.0,1.0,2017-04-09,Extremely slow service. Took 15 minutes to be acknowledged by our server. The hostess ended up getting our drink order in. I went the last half of my dinner without a refill. This isn't the first time this has happened at this location but it'll be the last -- won't be returning.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-converse,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08
20,Rober B.,"El Paso, TX",15,2,,1.0,2017-07-01,"Poor reception. Hostess tried to seat a family of 3 adults, 1 child, and a baby in a small booth. When asked to get a bigger booth the hostess gave us an unprofessional attitude, we decided to leave.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-converse,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08
17,Efy E.,"San Antonio, TX",11,10,22.0,2.0,2017-07-30,"It doesn't seem to matter whether its the weekend or week day, the service is so slow... Sometimes the waiter/waitress seems to forget about their customers. And hour wait for food is ridiculous, if you're going to have to wait that long you'd think they'd let you know in advance or at least keep you updated with your order. And hour with no news about your order sucks!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-converse,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12
