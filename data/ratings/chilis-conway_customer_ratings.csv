13,Jim N.,"Winchester, KY",22,498,13.0,2.0,2012-11-19,"Busy place but this was my first visit since being a weekly regular several years ago at another location.  I was disappointed in menu changes that seem to focus on sauces, cheeses and fried......overall, we rate it as ""MEH""....  I guess visits at 3 to 4 year intervals is about right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conway,,,,,
14,Tim S.,"Winston-Salem, NC",3,311,436.0,3.0,2012-12-29,It's Chili's.  They are the same no matter where you go.  The food is decent.  I use to think Chili's was the best until I started eating at other places. The Conway Chili's was good.  I think our waitress was a little goofy but she did a good job.  She did do a hard sell on specific margaritas to win some contest.  I normally despise this behavior but it was a few days before Christmas so I let it slide.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conway,,,,,
8,Mischita H.,"Orlando, FL",173,612,1346.0,3.0,2013-12-04,Pretty standard Chilli's lunch experience - friendly greeters and decent service.  I tried a lunch meal combo of chicken fajitas and salad.  Not bad. The inside temperature was a little bit colder than I'd like in December.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conway,,,,,
15,Gerard N.,"Conway, AR",2,25,31.0,4.0,2014-04-11,Its chili's. ... the food is good. it was especially good tonight. enjoyed my food & my wife loved hers. I think they are heating up because of the competition around them in Conway now. they are definitely holding their own.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conway,,,,,
11,Cyrilla A.,"Conway, AR",31,65,2.0,5.0,2014-12-09,This place is always on top of our list when we want to have pick up. Fast and delicious! Staff is always courteous. Never had any problems dining or calling in orders!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conway,,,,,
19,Nicole B.,"Norman, OK",48,69,56.0,5.0,2015-01-14,"Best Chili's I have ever been to. The food was prepared beautifully, and the service was great. The restaurant was very clean and the restrooms were also very clean and maintained well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conway,,,,,
12,Kevin B.,"North Little Rock, AR",0,7,3.0,2.0,2015-03-17,"The service was very slow. The waiter only came by to check drink levels twice in the hour we were there. My girlfriend and I ordered two appetizers for our meal. It took 35 minutes for two appetizers . The food was great, right temperature and fresh. The time it reached the table we were almost in the process of leaving. Not a good experience at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conway,,,,,
18,Emily L.,"Quitman, AR",0,10,,1.0,2015-05-09,"Awful experience. This isn't the first bad experience here, but the first time I had the yelp app to tell others about it. Ok, to start it off, the waitress was super loud and looked dirty and had food in her hair! Yuck. My mom ordered the fajitas and rice and I ordered ribs and some fries. The fries and ribs were cold when I got them and I had gotten like 10 fries max. Too little food for $10. My moms fajitas had hair in them and she didn't get her rice till right before we were about to leave. The plates had some kind of weird orange sauce on them, so they were dirty. The waitresses hand got in my moms guacamole sauce so that ruined those for her. Overall awful experience. I will never be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conway,,,,,
17,Sierra W.,"Conway, AR",0,3,,4.0,2015-06-08,"Love this chilis! Great food and service. I recommend the chicken bacon ranch quesadillas, it's the best food there!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conway,,,,,
16,Lyndsey G.,"Centerville, UT",0,7,2.0,1.0,2015-07-02,"Freezing cold in here! People are putting their jackets on. Our napkins are moving from all the cold air. We asked our server if she could check and see if they could adjust the air and no adjustments were made. It was so cold, we couldn't even enjoy our food and just wanted to get out of here!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conway,,,,,
6,Jesse K.,"Tulsa, OK",2,24,2.0,2.0,2015-12-06,"Good food, but didn't honor the price in the menu. The unlimited soup and salad was one price before 4pm and another after. They didn't honor that and stated that it changes on the weekend. They don't have anything in the menu stating that.  My wife ordered a skinny margarita and had to order a second shot as she was convinced there wasn't any tequila on the first one. Just super sweet.  Too bad. I'm normally a big Chili's fan.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conway,,,,,
9,William L.,"Kaneohe, HI",1,8,,2.0,2016-06-07,Okay for the drinks. Got food to go and got an easily medium steak rather than medium rare. Nice people there won't be back and I live right down the street,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conway,,,,,
7,Cynthia S.,"Conway, AR",1,19,1.0,2.0,2016-06-19,"I eat here for my six year old. My meals are always hit and miss. I usually get the Caribbean chicken salad or the smoked chicken quesadillas. The staff are usually friendly and accommodating but the food is always very, very average.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conway,,,,,
4,Linzy S.,"Alexandria, VA",13,2,,5.0,2016-06-26,"Thankyou so much for your amazing service/food always ! At anywhere (any location)  I don't really give out review but particularly this one place I just have to give one!! My husband ordered Cajun chicken pasta and I had something chicken as well , I just don't remember but I have to say ....Hands down the best chicken I've ever had at any restaurant ! Love love love ~ I just don't know how they cooked their chicken but it's just so moist and delish !!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conway,,,,,
10,Cheryl T.,"Little Rock, AR",0,36,,2.0,2016-07-22,"Limited selections on menu, lots of salt & burgers costing $10.99. David's is a much better choice!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conway,,,,,
5,Micah S.,"Conway, AR",43,9,2.0,4.0,2016-09-12,One of my favorite places to eat. Never had a bad experience here. Good food and cold beer!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conway,,,,,
1,Kim K.,"Fort Worth, TX",20,175,129.0,5.0,2017-04-29,"My step son and I stopped here for a late lunch.  They had a large group of teenagers in the dining area and I consider not staying because I was worried the food would take forever.  However we grabbed a booth in the bar area.  We were greeted immediately by a very friendly server.  We ordered fried pickles as a appetizer and they arrived quickly, My son ordered the crispy chicken fingers and fries and I had the shrimp tacos. Everything arrived quickly and was very good. When in Conway in the future we will return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conway,,,,,
2,Brandy P.,"El Dorado, AR",68,12,,3.0,2017-08-12,"We usually love to eat at Chili's restaurants. We are here in a large group after my daughter's college graduation. The food was okay, but the services was great.  I must say that our only complaint would be is that we have had way better food, and our expectations as far as the food goes was met!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conway,,,,,
0,Jennifer G.,"Sherwood, AR",8,8,1.0,5.0,2017-08-31,"This is easily the best Chilis I have ever been to. The food is always excellent and it's rare we have to wait more than 10 minutes. The servers are amazing!!! Tonight we went a bit earlier than normal and was seated in Blake's section. He anticipated our every need and made sure my pasta had enough sauce! I always forget to get the green onions off of my Cajun chicken pasta, but he made sure to double check that I wanted everything on it. Made my night! Also gave us drinks to go before we left and a box before I could finish asking. Best service ever! Definitely ask for him!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conway,,,,,
3,Cindy D.,"Conway, AR",0,23,,4.0,2017-10-05,"My daughter and I went to eat and we had the best time. Food was good but our server was hilarious. She called herself the old Lady, such a crazy personality and  refreshing. Had us laughing the whole meal... we could see she loves people and her career at Chilies. I had to tell the manager what great time we had! We will ask for her always",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-conway,3.24,3.24,3.24,,3.2400000000000007
