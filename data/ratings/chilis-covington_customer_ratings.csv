16,Don M.,"Madisonville, LA",7,23,,4.0,2014-09-12,This location has always had good food and service. I usually get the fajitas and they are always top notch.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-covington,,,,,
17,Donna J.,"Covington, LA",5,20,20.0,5.0,2014-09-26,"Roni was an excellent server!   The service was great, food was portioned great with an affordable price.   The Table side guacamole was fantastic!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-covington,,,,,
12,Msb1197 S.,"Covington, LA",43,62,30.0,1.0,2014-10-24,"Ordered lunch for me and my co worker. When I went to pick it up, I used the take out entrance & no one was there. I saw a bag sitting on the back counter (probably mine but wasn't labeled). I waited 10 minutes until someone notice I was there. Finally the bartender came over & rung up my order, I paid, then she just walked off! So I waited another 10min until another lady (manager?) noticed me standing there, I told her I had paid but still didn't get the orders. She looked around & saw the bag & said ""oh I think this is yours"". So all that time my food sat there and got cold! Not to mention I was late getting back to work! Won't be going there for lunch anymore! Not happy! Poor service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-covington,,,,,
5,Elvina J.,"Covington, LA",2,32,21.0,5.0,2015-02-20,"Always a great experience. Wait staff is attentive - especially Taylor, she is terrific and always makes sure you have a good time.  I don't know how they manage to deliver wonderful food, fast and affordable. We never eat at chains but after months of seeing their parking lot full all the time, we decided to give it a try. Their 2 for $20 is such a great deal - why bother with fast food joints at these prices when the flavor and quality is so much better? If you want to add drinks and dessert go for the 3 for $35 - their margaritas are yummy. I've gotten hooked on their bacon cheese burger, always piping hot and succulent - cooked to perfection. The chicken quesadilla is tasty and we love the spicy ranch. In fact, I ask for extra as dip for my French fries. This night my hubby raved about the chicken flat bread. Plus, the portions are so large you can count on taking home leftovers. The menu variety makes this the perfect place for groups of all ages and a top go to choice for our family.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-covington,,,,,
0,Jim H.,"Covington, LA",40,31,49.0,3.0,2015-03-01,"Well, it's not the same as it used to be, very bland. Cesar salad very good, chicken chrispers just not like it used to be. Various other items just not good enough to come back for - sorry to say.  But the service was excellent! Christine was wonderful!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-covington,,,,,
14,Lorie K.,"Madisonville, LA",5,14,7.0,5.0,2015-03-09,Absolutely love it the new be able to pay at table play games  the food was great service great atmosphere little loud but still could hear convenient place,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-covington,,,,,
11,Matt J.,"Folsom, LA",1,15,3.0,2.0,2015-05-11,Service is slow. For the third straight trip soup was cold. Go to the Chili's in Mandeville.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-covington,,,,,
15,Liz A.,"Metairie, LA",11,14,17.0,2.0,2015-05-18,"Probably not coming back here the food is better at the other location in Mandeville. Most of the food was bland and the service ok. Went there yesterday 5/17 around 1 pm it was busy! My sis and husband got us a table in the corner of the bar. I personally hate being in the corner and facing the wall but at least there were windows. Our waiter a young guy seemed good at first then went kind of MIA took awhile to get out the bland Spinach Queso dip and for him to come back and take our order. 4 out of 5 of us ordered the lighter fare. My mom ordered mango chicken and I got sirloin we ended switching cause hers was so hot ""heat"" and I agreed! My steak was on the raw side but she wanted it. ""Fiesta salad"" was my side- lettuce, cheese, and dressing really? and few cooked tomatoes w my steak. The rice that came with the other two very bland. The manager and hostess didn't seem very happy either never really smiled. The girl bartender and other servers seemed happy. My server stated he has been working there a year but doesn't know the menu. He asked me what size steak on lighter menu? Well the whole point is smaller size 6 oz. Overall just disappointed in the food and service. The bathroom is pretty far away from the bar and one sink!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-covington,,,,,
8,Matt T.,"Hammond, LA",21,4,2.0,1.0,2015-07-07,Don't ever go here you'll spend more time at front door than you will eating food. Plus raw sewage smell outside explains food quality,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-covington,,,,,
13,Dana N.,"Kentwood, LA",1,4,,1.0,2015-11-17,"My family loves Chili's and we have given this particular location numerous opportunities to please us. Needless to say, they have come up short EVERY time but this last trip was the worst! Our server took at least 10 mins after each request.  It took over 15 mins to get chips/salsa and drinks.  The point of an appetizer is to snack before a meal:/ my husband's fajita chicken looked like that processed prepackaged meat u buy in the grocery store.  The veggies in them were undercooked and COLD! Also, my chicken crispers were cold and tasted more like chicken jerky.  Sadly, the only meal that was acceptable was my sons $5 kids meal that we got vouched for via coupon.  I am not one to quickly write a bad review as I understand you can have an off day.  But this was this last straw.  I mean, we live in Louisiana where the cuisine is some of the best in the world...the only reason chain restaurants like this even stay afloat is bc it's a quick and convenient meal.  They didn't deliver and we won't be back! Save ur money and go somewhere else!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-covington,,,,,
9,John S.,"Madisonville, LA",0,22,,1.0,2016-01-03,"As a former stock holder of Chili's parent corporation, I am glad to have sold my shares of stocks. I was a huge fan of this restaurant for many years. The Mandeville location is the only one that I will go to from time to time. I have given this location more than enough chances to get better but it just keeps getting worse. If the food isn't greasy or cold, the service is just horrible. I stay away from this place now and won't give it another chance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-covington,,,,,
7,Ben M S.,"Franklinton, LA",0,11,,5.0,2016-04-07,"Today was excellent! Service was on par. Food was delicious. We had the two for twenty. Baby back ribs with Dr Pepper sauce, Applewood bacon burger, both with fries and the wife had a salad and we shared the Berry dessert. Kudos to all you guys at Chili's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-covington,,,,,
10,Cherish D.,"Saint Benedict, LA",0,12,1.0,1.0,2016-05-20,Awful service. Waited an hour to get our food. Waited 30 minutes to get out chips and dip. Bread was burnt and molded. Isn't this suppose to be a chain??? Awful never coming back!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-covington,,,,,
6,Kelly B.,"Tickfaw, LA",13,19,42.0,1.0,2016-09-11,Just walked out after waiting over an hour for 2 salads. Won't be back! Totally ridiculous!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-covington,,,,,
4,Jordan M.,"Houston, TX",36,11,4.0,1.0,2017-02-10,The waiter brings me a completely different dish then what I order and even admitted to knowing that it was the wrong dish. My order was resubmitted and was not honored as priority. I was served as if it was a whole new order. Then the order wanted to bring me tea as a refill for my beer. Then told us the credit card was rejected but yet it worked just fine in the table checkout computer. I was very pressured by the waiter as if I was wrong and he was right.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-covington,,,,,
2,Tina E.,"Snellville, GA",0,119,86.0,3.0,2017-05-31,"This is not a location that I would recommend to go most especially if you're driving. Five guys usually is greasy but this was crazy greasy. The line was insane, the wait horrendous, several people came back to the counter because something was wrong with their order. A small fry which is priced separately from the burger is a small handful.  I had asked for barbecue sauce on my sandwich but that did not happen but was not worth the time to have them correct. Bun was made-sat on counter. Hamburger done put on bun- sat on the counter. Wrapped into foil sat on the counter. Picked up put in bag with ticket number and sat at the fry station. My hamburger was not hot when I got it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-covington,,,,,
3,A D.,"Covington, LA",0,2,,2.0,2017-08-30,"Picked up food for dinner. . .it was terrible.  I got dried out quesadillas, without sour cream or a side of guacamole.  The burger was floating in grease.  The food is usually better than this when we eat inside.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-covington,,,,,
1,Elizabeth F.,"New Orleans, LA",0,15,4.0,2.0,2017-11-02,Quite possible the worst Chili's we have ever been to anywhere. Service is slow and bad. Food is not the consistent dishes you expect when you order and not warm....and drinks come in the middle or end of meal. We gave it a second try and same thing. One time it was not busy at all so there was just no excuse. Drive on...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-covington,,,,,
