3,Annette P.,"Irving, TX",110,293,193.0,1.0,2013-05-27,"Service here is r.....e.....a.....l.....l.....y slow and not very friendly.  If it weren't for the fact that my friend and I were really hungry and couldn't wait for the next city, we probably wouldn't have stopped here.  But we did and it wasn't worth it.  The food itself wasn't bad as was exactly what you would expect from this kind of place.  The unfriendly waitstaff is enough to not recommend this place at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-crowley,,,,,
0,Steve C.,"Jennings, LA",0,15,1.0,4.0,2014-06-18,Well to start I read all the post by other guest and they are from past years is why I'm posting this. We found none of the post to be true. The place was clean everyone we met was friendly and service was fast. They even have now on every table a mini laptop that displays specials happy hour games and you can order drinks meals and pay your bill right at the table.  I saw nothing made from powder and diffidently no one pissing or farting in the glass as one writer posted. We found the food to be tasteful and hot.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-crowley,,,,,
