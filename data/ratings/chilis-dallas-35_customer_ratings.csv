Now being in the airport, I would expect customers to be more of a challenge,(missed flights, nervous about flying, delays or in my case... Waiting on luggage that didn't make my flight) but I would still expect a server that can, at very least, smile every once in a while. Ours acted as if she did, her face would crack. Service was bad but I quickly figured out why. We entered the restaurant at 7:50 and I guess they close at 8:00. Now if I had noticed this, I would have moved on to another place. We realized it was closing time when we saw a server, Nicole, walking around the dining room talking on her cell phone while stocking plates and such at the side station. We also realized that she also does not feel it is her d**n job to do other servers work as she was so eloquently telling her coworkers across the dining room. Then came the stacking of all the chairs in the dining area and the bar, BEFORE we have even received our food. The staff did everthing short of walk right up and say, ""get the hell out"" to make it known that they had no intention of serving anyone else. The worst part about it, the manager stood there watching the entire staff act in such a way and did NOTHING to correct it or stop it. Meanwhile, I tried waving to the manager to get a drink refill since our server was clearly busy cleaning to go home, but he looked right at me and walked away. Never got anymore service, didn't even finish my meal before she was taking my plate... No to go box offered, no drink refill offered and dessert.... Forget about it. Lol. Still tipped, not as much as I normally would. Adell would have made much much more if she would have just smiled.

I appreciated I wasn't left to wait for a table for one, but was seated immediately. My waitress was very sweet and offered her suggestions on the two menu options I was deciding between. I chose the Caribbean Salad, no dressing. Oh my goodness it was tasty! I strongly suggest skipping the dressing, it was a honey-mustard-like dressing that would have ruined all the amazing flavors of the fruit.  There were a good amount of greens, not just a bunch of cheap cabbage. The pineapple, mandarin oranges, cranberries & peppers were all fresh. And if they were canned, boy they did a great job of hiding it. The green onions and cilantro added the perfect ""kick"" to the sweet of the fruit. Great compliments all around. The grilled chicken on top was a decent portion and not too dry. I would've preferred it not be chilled as when I read"" grill chicken"" I assume freshly grilled, not grilled days ago and chilled when needed. I also ordered a side of fries and they were good too. Lightly seasoned, so you can still taste the potato :)  I don't ever frequent Chili's, but after having this salad, I might just give them another try.

We'd all decided on our meals... when our server informed us that they were out of literally 2/3 of the menu. No salads, no fajitas, no freshmex. So basically... burgers or apps were available. We ordered and got our selections -- my enchilada soup was thick and lukewarm, more flourescent orange than anything resembling what happens at the actual restaurant. We doused his turkey burger in salsa to get it to resemble something with taste.

31,Steve C.,"Dallas, TX",0,17,,1.0,2016-06-27,"Absolutely pathetic. The only reason there's ever a wait, is because people have been waiting 45 minutes for their check. Servers rush to the table to great tables, but then stand around on their phones..talk to one another. They blatantly ignore customers as they signal them to order, refill a drink, grab a check. You work at a freaking airport where people are in a hurry. We waited 30 minutes before we waved down a fellow worker to order drinks. We waited another 15 minutes before I walked up to the bar and grabbed our drinks off the well. The bartender looked disgusted as she asked what I was doing. I told her it had been more than half an hour since someone came to check on us. Instead of asking what she could do or if she could find a manager, she rolled her eyes and took her heavy self onwards. Moral of the story, take a sack lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-dallas-35?start=20,1.76,1.76,1.76,,1.7600000000000002

So we give Chili's a try for dinner.  Hostess was super friendly and apolgetic (4+ stars). After 35 mins, got a table. Our food servers were nice, but overworked, and it took awhile for our order to be taken (3 stars). Chips and salsa were fresh and ok, but the Mango Chicken and Margarita Salad Bowl with chicken were both bland and too spicy (2.5 stars).

One of the few airport restaurants that don't understand time zones and the fact people in them tend to be operating on a different time zone.  Too early for chips and salsa as a light lunch because here it's breakfast time only. Walked next door and got lunch there instead.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-dallas-35?start=20,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0

The service is terribly slow for an airport restaurant, so slow in fact, on my return trip, I had to leave after waiting 45 mins for my order. The food is  just above edible and discredits every other Chilis on the planet. The management doesn't seem to care that the service or the food is bad.

Got my own utensils and napkins. Never got a refill on my drink and took over 10 minutes to get my check and only after I flagged down the waiter who kept disappearing to the back or having lengthy conversations with the bar tender instead of checking on tables.

I ordered the biscuit breakfast which was just bacon, egg, and cheese on a biscuit with a side of fried potatoes. It probably would have been better had I just ordered the same things at one of the fast food restaurants out in the middle of the terminal. For some reason I felt I wanted to sit down and be waited on but the service was slow and nonexistent. He took my order, brought the food, and I never saw him again. You pay on the terminal thing on the table and I spent $17 for the biscuit breakfast.
