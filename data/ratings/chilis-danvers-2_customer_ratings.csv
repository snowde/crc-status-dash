37,Dustin N.,"Peabody, MA",3,26,,1.0,2012-01-30,"Hadn't been here in somewhere around 5 years.. I vaguely remembered not liking it and that being the reason for not being there in so long (but eating at Fridays right across the road numerous times) but I wasn't totally sure so decided to give it a whirl. First thing we see when we walk in is a drunk man slightly aide stepping out of the bar area cursing to himself... Ok weird (its thursday at 7pm). Then there's more drunk guys still at the bar. Wouldn't think this as a ""bar hangout"". So we are seated quickly and the waitress came over rapidly. And took our drink order. 2 margaritas... Now I realize we aren't in a place expected tp have the beat margaritas... But I should have just ordered blended ice with lime juice. It was extremely sour and I'm almost positive an eye droplets worth of tequila. At this point I take a bathroom break, and now the bathroom isn't necessarily dirty but is definatly in need of an annual scrubbing to ride the floor of the buildup of grime (mold?) On the floor around the sinks and under the paper towel dispenser.  So now put food shows up. My girlfriend got a chicken that they absolutlu drowned in a sauce. It came with corn on the cob that was so mushy it fell apart when she picked it up and french fries that were decent (gotta earn that half a star somewhere)  My burger wasn't terrible... But I would be able to get a better one basically anywhere else.  As for the staff. They were all very nice from hostess to waitress and even who I assume to br a manager of some sort who brought our food out. (There's your other half star)  Needless to say I remember why I stopped going there and I'm not gonna forget this time around. Peace out chili's. Its been real... I guess i hate giving bad reviews... but it is what it is. a lot of people i know like it here but its definatly not for me. i would prefer fridays across the street any day, its cleaner better food and drinks and just a better layout",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-danvers-2?start=20,1.988,1.988,1.988,1.988,1.988
41,Justin S.,"Peabody, MA",7,36,,2.0,2012-06-08,"The first time I ever came here was absolutely terrible. Took forever to be seated in spite of the fact that nobody else was waiting ahead of us, and there were plenty of open tables. Waitress took forever to do anything, starting with taking 15 minutes to come get our drink order. Food came out cold. Waitress brought the wrong check over when we were done. A catastrophic failure, all around. Over a year later, I decide to give this place a second chance. I will say the service was MUCH better, though, in my opinion, still only qualified as ""adequate"". The men's room, however, was a disaster. It looked like it hadn't been cleaned in weeks. Overall, they seem to be doing better than my first visit, but still not well enough to merit regular return visits.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-danvers-2?start=40,2.216,2.216,2.216,2.216,2.216

45,Amy C.,"Peabody, MA",0,2,,1.0,2013-03-22,"I went to Chili's in Danvers on March 22, 2013.  When I first walked in I noticed a foul odor.   But I was there to meet a  friend and didn't want to disrupt my meeting with her so I went in anyway.    I was there for about an hour.   The entire time I was there the place smelled foul -- like a room that hadn't been cleaned well in a very long time.   It was really gross.   I couldn't tell exactly where it was coming from.   I suspect lack of cleanliness in and around the seats and  tables was the problem.    I didn't eat much of my lunch.   The smell was so unappetizing.   I didn't want to eat anything.  Really gross.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-danvers-2?start=40,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116

Walked in, stood for five minutes no one came to greet us to a table so we decided to give them the benefit of the doubt grabbed the menus ourselves and take a seat. It was a beautiful quiet Monday evening with two people eating at the otherwise of the restaurant and a somewhat decent crowd hanging at the bar side. We sat there for 10 minutes as waitresses and waiters passed by and gave us eye contact, and not a single one came up to us. 10 minutes passed by and we decided to get up and leave. I could have called a waiter over but why should that be my responsibility if I'm going to pay them at the end of a meal and forced to be generous and tip? Not a single way did I want to call them over. So the 15 minute mark came by and we decided to leave the menu on the table and leave. Sorry not sorry, not coming back.

It completely exceeded our expectations!

34,Sha D.,"Medford, MA",0,149,,2.0,2014-10-06,"Normally I like Chilli's. But this one is pretty bad. My friends and I came in around ten p.m. to take advantage of happy hour & needless to say our hour here wasn't so happy.  I think who ever was working in the kitchen that night had to have been drunk, because everyones food was messed up in some way. We started off with four appetizers(bottomless chips&salsa, potato skins, burger sliders, and classic nachos.) The potato skins were burnt, the nachos were missing beans, and the sliders only came with cheese when they were supposed to come with onion and bacon. Our waitress offered to re-make the sliders, and the new order came out finally came out ten minutes before they closed. Atleast the chips and salsa were good, but we devoured them in less than two minutes and were never offered a re-fill. The manager took the potato skins and sliders off of our bill, which was nice. The original chicken crispers that I got for my meal made me confused. I have gotten the same thing at other Chillis and these were just different. The batter had a different texture and kept falling off the chicken. Also my fries were completely unseasoned. My friends liked the steak and fajitas they ordered, so good for them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-danvers-2?start=20,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152

0,Adam K.,"Danvers, MA",0,7,,5.0,2015-02-05,"Don't listen to all those people giving Chili's a bad review, this is the greatest restaurant I have ever been to.  No matter where you are, you shouldn't be too far from a Chili's restaurant. It is a huge worldwide chain, with a famous Tex-Mex style I will always love. The food is AMAZING, the service is great, there are TV's everywhere playing the local sports, and a fantastic bar area. I usually get the ""chicken crispers"" which are these amazing chicken fingers with an EXTREMELY crispy, shell-like breading, and a succulent meaty inside, that probably makes them the greatest food I have ever eaten. They have so many other foods too, lots of them having an American-southwest theme. They have SO MANY other additions to the restaurant, including these little-tablet things at every table called a ""ziosk"" where kids can play games and do activities, and you can even pay with it, having a card swiping area and a slot for the receipt to come out! PLEASE consider eating here. It is so great, and all those haters giving bad reviews for this restaurant clearly don't know what they are talking about.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-danvers-2,2.32,2.32,2.32,2.484,2.32

Bad decision altogether!  We were given 25 minutes but waited 45 when noticed there was some tables available but not cleaned up, we approached the host to speak about our concern, instead listen and go check why nobody was cleaning the tables, he responded back to us claiming the 30 minutes had not expired yet. 2 minutes later, he went to clean the table himself, after that our food took forever to come, to the point when we started noticing people that had been seated after us were already leaving and our food --nothing--!! When we asked our waitress, instead go check on the status of our food, he said: Oh I don't cook! I just bring the food out, I DO NOT COOK! The food took forever and then came out dry and tasteless. I had the Salmon plate (600 calories).  It was a poor and frustrating dinner experience for the 5 of us. I do not recommend!!

29,Jan B.,"Lowell, MA",0,15,,3.0,2015-04-02,"I have never been to Chili's before, fearing it was too spicy for me (the logo has a hot pepper on it after all). And this despite the fact there is a branch about 2 miles down the street I live on. I finally stopped into the Danvers branch today because a friend had a gift card and wanted to treat me to lunch. All in all, I was impressed. The waitress was very pleasant and helpful. The food came quickly (perhaps too quickly...see below), and my meal was very nice. I started with a ""house side salad"" which was practically a meal in itself and very fresh. This was followed by a Margharita flatbread, which was delicious. Now obviously my choices were not ""tex-mex"" but they were very good. My partner for lunch, however, was disappointed with her meal. She ordered the ""smoked bone in wings"" and a salad for lunch. The wings were on the menu as ""Bone-in wings slow smoked in house over pecan wood. Served with Chili's classic BBQ sauce"". The wings were not smoked, they were deep fat fried and had absolutely no seasoning on them at all, let alone the ""smoked"" seasoning promised. And the ""classic BBQ sauce"" was plain old ketchup with no BBQ taste whatsoever.  There were very few customers in the restaurant, so there was no real reason to take a shortcut and fry the wings. So, a mixed review: my lunch was excellent, my companion's was not at all as advertised.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-danvers-2?start=20,2.4,2.4,2.4,2.1239999999999997,2.4

Other servers were running circles around her. She came to our table a total of 4 times the ENTIRE meal. Never asked us how anything was, and we had to ask for everything we needed. 4) None of our food came out like it was supposed to. Our steak was supposed to be medium, came out well done. Our quesadilla came with NO CHICKEN... Just a pinch of bacon and barely any cheese. Our fajitas were supposed to come with lettuce and salsa and none of that showed up. 5) When we asked for a new quesadilla it honestly looked like just threw some chicken and a little more cheese and refried it instead of making a new one.  6) The manager barely acknowledged that we were upset. He didn't do anything to make us feel better about the situation and honestly made us feel like our opinion doesn't matter.  Honestly the only blessing was the margaritas.

The batter wasn't very good. The baby back ribs were terrible...  Not tender at all and the taste was off putting. The shrimp and prime rib fajitas weren't bad. The shrimp was super salty though.

We walked in and asked for an open table inside the bar area. We were greeted after sitting there for 10 minutes by a snippy waitress. My boyfriend ordered the Classic Patron Margarita and I ordered the Strawberry Patron Margarita as well as our waters with lemon. The waters both came out without lemons and the margaritas had too much purée and it consisted of mostly ice. By each sip, I questioned if there was actually any alcohol in them. Our appetizer came out- the White Spinach Queso with chips. There wasn't enough queso for a baby to eat but certainly not for an appetizer or how many chips they gave you- which was heaping over the plate while the dip only barely covered one layer of the skillet. My boyfriend ordered the Dr. Pepper BBQ and Craft BBQ ribs with the two set sides of mashed potatoes and broccoli. It came and was suppose to be topped with cilantro but never actually got it and the broccoli was freezing cold. I ordered the fajitas since on the cover of the menu it said ""We practically discovered the fajita and now we're making it even better."" I tried to order the hard shell tacos and my waitress- Joselina- practically shouted ""they're gross. They are too hard and just disgusting."" So, I said okay, I'll go with the soft shell with chicken and shrimp. It came on a sizzling skillet with a small side plate with the soft shells in aluminum foil. Not sure why it was in aluminum foil because they were cold. The peppers and ""caramelized"" onions had to be peeled off the skillet and my ""onions"" were actually onion peels. They gave me barely any pico de gayo and the guacamole tasted like it had bee left out for a while and most definitely not fresh. The waitress never took anything off the table after we tried to tell her we were all set with everything and said ""I'll take it later"" including our first rounds of water glasses after ordering the second round. Never asked if we needed anything, never had silverware until we asked for it, never got my boyfriend napkins after he ordered ribs! Never even asked if we wanted another Margarita! We were going to  order dessert but didn't want to have a bad experience with that too. Now heading to a business that deserves our money for something sweet. WORST experience ever.  Also, get rid of the bags that hold the silverware- they're useless and are not environmentally friendly. Wrap them in napkins like a normal restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-danvers-2,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
7,Mary I.,"Stoneham, MA",22,340,1336.0,4.0,2016-12-17,I think this is a good chilis. The service was pretty fast for a Saturday night and the good was good. I came with a friend for my birthday and they gave me free ice cream because it was my birthday. :),https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-danvers-2,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
19,P L.,"Lynn, MA",0,7,2.0,1.0,2016-12-19,Decided to give this place another shot.  Got here at 7:00pm on a Monday night and they're OUT OF COKE!!!   How does that happen?  You upper level managers in charge of the lower level moron in charge of this location need to seriously evaluate the management of this location.  The night manager in particular really sucks at his job all around!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-danvers-2,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48

6,Jennifer R.,"Danvers, MA",56,329,25.0,1.0,2017-08-23,"For a chain restaurant chilis has always been one of my favorites, I must say this location has ruined that. Service is ALWAYS horrible! My mother daughter and I went in yesterday for lunch and it truly felt like we were inconveniencing the staff by showing up! They open at 11 we got there around 1150 but still they made us feel as though they weren't ready for patrons. My soup was cold (so cold that the shredded cheese on top of the chicken tortilla soup did not even melt). food was greasy. My mom has a food allergy that they could care less about. We won't be back, at least not to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-danvers-2,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28
4,J D.,"Arlington, MA",0,10,,1.0,2017-10-01,"We have come to this location a number of times.  The quality of food has gone down.  Not coming back. Sunday night, half empty parking lot, lots of empty tables. 15-20 min wait, only one couple in front.  You know they are understaffed! The Tex Mex prime rib bowl is gone, so we order salmon. We specify *well done* for salmon.  Comes out undercooked.  Broccoli is undercooked, tastes raw, like cellar taste.  Manager comes over, offers to either cook it more, or new meal.  We opt for new meal.  Should have switched to something else. Now the salmon is well done, broccoli is still way underdone.  Sorry, I don't enjoy dry undercooked broccoli. And the ziosk is a total ripoff- calculating tip on original + replacement meals.  We are done with this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-danvers-2,2.2,2.2,2.2,,2.2
3,Glenn C.,"Wakefield, MA",0,3,,1.0,2017-10-14,"We arrived at 8pm and more than half the restaurant was empty, 20-30 min wait.  Finally seated no drinks for 20 min, food came out awful returned half of it.  I mean they couldn't make Mac and cheese right.   Service was awful waiter disappeared for 20 min at a time with us waiting for bill and Pepsi refills. I will always go to Reading location for now on",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-danvers-2,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08
1,Tracy B.,"Everett, MA",159,857,3017.0,1.0,2017-11-13,"Its Chilis... You know what to expect when you get there...  But this was just bad... Got there around 730 on a Saturday and the place was DEAD, but yet we had to wait 20 mins to be seated (because they didnt have enough staff - but really 20 mins and there were maybe 6 tables seated)  So we are finally seated & then have to wait 20 mins for a drink order.  So you can already guess how the pace of the night went.  She tried to be overly nice but at that point it was all just fake as there was NO HUSTLE to her and she was just soo laid back & not caring about service.  Food was Blah, Things were wrong,  Tasty yes, because we like Chili's food, just everything else was Shitty...  Prob wont stop here again anytime soon!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-danvers-2,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92
5,Misty O.,"Peabody, MA",0,9,,1.0,2017-11-26,Says they close at 11 online and sign by the door... Went at 1030 for quick drink and take out doors are locked. No notification or anything. Not good to shut down early all the time. 3rd time this has happened. Ridiculous. Don't bother.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-danvers-2,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92
2,Ian G.,"Lynn, MA",0,1,,1.0,2017-12-30,Went today for lunch. My 7 year old ordered mini burgers and she was served her burgers on moldy bread. We showed who I assume was the manager and she could've cared less. Just told us she doesn't understand how that could've happened. Then after we gave the waitress the cash to pay she sends another waitress over with our change. She was our waitress and couldn't even take 30 seconds to bring us change and say thank you. Needless to say don't think we'll be back anytime soon,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-danvers-2,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92
