4,Pam Z.,"Sycamore, IL",4,9,,1.0,2017-10-30,"I understand that the restaurant just opened and I was looking forward to it as I love Chili's. I order the chicken crispers and my husband a chicken sandwich. We got the chips and salsa and the chips were extremely salty as well as our fries, we sent them back. The corn had to much pepper on it, I couldn't eat it and the crispers were not very good.  I think they really need to re train the cooks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-dekalb,,,,,
1,Dave T.,"Bartlett, IL",11,24,,3.0,2017-10-31,"Waitress did a good job, but had to ask for napkins (you get one small), catsup was empty. As for the food, I just ordered a cheeseburger & my wife soup. I ordered the burger well done and it was not, no cheese, and the bun was not fresh. The burger comes with fries which were just ok. My wife liked her soup!  The place was super busy, but unless they improve the quality of their food I doubt it will remain that way.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-dekalb,,,,,
5,Mansour A.,"Brookline, MA",0,10,9.0,5.0,2017-11-01,"I love Chilis. I have been in a lot of branches inside and outside the States.  Even though the DeKalb branch was opened recently, this branch is the best branch I have ever been in. I have tried this branch for 3 different visits ordering different foods, every time they impress me more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-dekalb,,,,,
0,Dave Y.,"Sycamore, IL",225,191,50.0,5.0,2017-11-05,"Been here thrise now,  with different sizes parties,  one of them for lunch.  Service is very friendly,  however that is to be expected at a newer resturaunt. Food comes out quickly, which is a plus if you are attending the theater near by or back to work We have ordered now burgers, salad the smokehouse combo,  queso and fajitas.  All the food came prepared as ordered,  which is difficult for my wife who has to have her burger as if it has been through a piano factory fire,  burnt beyond recognition or as some called ""well done"".  Yuk!  I do have two criticizims, neither of which affected our experience and one of which can not be changed. The first is we came during a 15 minute wait time.  Only my wife and I we're seated at a table for 6 while a group right after of us 4 we're seated at a table for 4. The other,  which now I think about it can be fixed,  is. The TVs are well placed but they then put up 1.5 foot glass partions on top which blocks many views of the TVs.  Welcome to DeKalb.  Keep things up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-dekalb,,,,,
7,Jared D.,"Sycamore, IL",73,10,1.0,1.0,2017-11-06,This place was absolutely horrible! We walked in and I wasn't even greeted by the hostesses their was 4 of them standing there. Once we approached then they asked if we wanted to sit and then bar and asked if I was over 21 I responded yes I'm over 21 but I would like a booth. I got asked to have a seat while the booth was cleaned 10 min later I was asked again what my age was and if I wanted to sit at the bar! I replied no thank you I'm still waiting for my booth. Waited another 5 min and still was not seated! Keep in mind there was no wait  and we could see that 3-4 booths were opened and clean but for what ever reason we couldn't be seated! Needless to say we walked out and will not be back to this location! Rude hostesses,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-dekalb,,,,,
3,Tom S.,"DeKalb, IL",5,158,247.0,1.0,2017-11-07,Two of the four people that night got sick. Never spent so much time sitting in the bathroom.  Not good,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-dekalb,,,,,
8,K H.,"Honolulu, HI",0,3,,2.0,2017-11-11,"The waitress was pleasant. We arrived at 2pm and didn't leave until after 3:30pm because the wait time for our food was over an hour when we did receive our meal, the food was luke warm. I'm sure that since it's only been open a few weeks they are still working out the kinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-dekalb,,,,,
6,Jeff B.,"Genoa, IL",0,7,2.0,4.0,2017-12-30,"Got there at 5 no problem getting a seat. Had not been to a Chili's in a number of years store had been totally redone. Updated menu for food and drinks. Had the Steak & Shrimp fajitas, guacamole Burger, tenders with fries, bacon burger and cheddar bites for an appetizer, and a kid's tenders meal. Fajitas were served with four tortillas which gave you plenty   to eat with everything piled on with it with a side of cheese guacamole sour cream and tomatoes. All of the chicken tenders were real white meat chicken and very tender and juicy with a nice breading crisp but not over done. Burgers piled-high cooked to medium rare very juicy served with fries excellent choice. Wait staff very attentive and took care of the kids at the table with us quickly and efficiently. Dinner for four and a half $68.25 And no cocktails not a bad deal. Only drawback is layout of restaurant floor that allows cold air with the doors open to push through in the middle of the restaurant where guests are sitting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-dekalb,,,,,
2,Stephanie O.,"DeKalb, IL",50,1,,3.0,2018-01-14,"Great atmosphere, friendly staff, food average tex-mex. Ordered medium sirloin it came well done. My beverage did not remain full either. This is more of witness inexperience than anything. We had to ask for appetizer plates every time I eat at this location, maybe not a norm for here. Nothing spectacular here,",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-dekalb,,,,,
