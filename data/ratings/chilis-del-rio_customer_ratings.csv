12,Carlos J.,"San Antonio, TX",7,287,18.0,3.0,2012-07-13,"I went here for dinner on 7/12 while in town on business. I ate at the bar.  Had the quesadilla club.  It was good.  The bartender was very pleasant, attentive, and efficient.   There was a crazy dude sitting at one end of the bar, talking to himself and invisible friends.  Anytime someone sat down next to him, he'd blather on and on until the person moved.  He was certifiable.  If nothing else, it was entertaining.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-del-rio,,,,,
18,Linda M.,"San Antonio, TX",0,10,,1.0,2014-02-20,"This is the second time I have been to this place; I don't think I will going back to this place again.  Both times I have gotten sick seeking medical treatment from eating here, the shrimp must not have been fresh and they must not change the greese for their onion strings.  It wasn't a busy time of day when my husband and I went and we didn't get our food fast although the waitress was attentive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-del-rio,,,,,
15,Jennifer K.,"Pensacola, FL",94,72,18.0,4.0,2014-06-04,Average Chilis. Was packed on a Tuesday at 6:00 in DR. Seems everywhere is. Nothing better or worse than expected. Was predictable.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-del-rio,,,,,
11,Chad R.,"Goldsboro, NC",11,1,1.0,1.0,2014-09-22,"Very poor service. Worst service I've experienced at a Chilis. Staff was undermanned and the staff that did exist didn't seem to put in the effort to overcome the shortfall. They either need to hire more staff, learn how to motivate better the existing staff, or close on nights that there simply isn't enough staff to provide quality service. Unfortunately, this particular Chilis gives Chilis a less than positive reputation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-del-rio,,,,,
7,Michael B.,"McKinney, TX",1,16,4.0,4.0,2014-09-23,Chili's is Chili's.  Their food is pretty universally reviewed.  This review is not about the food.  I'm in Del Rio for business and the bartenders made my 3 nights great.  All of them were very nice and kept my beer full.  I can't speak for the regular servers because I just sat at the bar but my experience was great.  I have to be back here in two weeks and will definitely be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-del-rio,,,,,
13,Tim G.,"Smithville, TX",0,8,,3.0,2014-11-05,"We have eating there a few times.  The food is Chili's typical stuff, nothing to complain about there.  Service is hit or miss.  Been there a few times and had good service, and been there a few times and had bad service. But with that said I think all the wait staff in Del Rio could use some training.  Some of the worst service I ever get is in Del Rio.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-del-rio,,,,,
8,David D.,"San Antonio, TX",0,9,,1.0,2015-02-23,"Save yourself the time. Literally.  We arrived on a Monday at 1240 for lunch on the road. Yes, I've lived in Del Rio before, so I understand things may be a bit slower.  However, we needed ""another minute"" to look at menus with 2 kids and 2 adults. We got 9 extra minutes before server came back.  Standard order taken at 1250.  Waiter back at 1256 to ask if I wanted soup and salad together or soup first (false choice, more on that later.) Server arrived back at 107 to tell us that they were out of kids pizza crust. We Reordered chicken nugget replacement. Assistant manager (?) back at 1215 to say that they ran out of my soup and would I like something else. Btw, now 25 mins past order time and no food on the table.  I told her that ""I'm sorry, you lost a customer and we would be leaving. We need to get back on the road and your process is broken for service."" She offered no charge. I said that we still had to leave. She offered to bring us items already done. Semi complete order brought out at 125pm, to go. I asked for utensils, but they didn't have them in the normal place (the bar) and brought some out at 128 from what I assume was a storeroom.  Food in the car was good.  It shouldn't take 3 follow up visits after the order to confirm what is available in the kitchen.  It shouldn't take 35 minutes for food (salads, nuggets, and flatbread) to arrive. I have a feeling that the kitchen staff was not at fault this time. Thanks for not making me pay, but I'd rather just have my time back with less hassle.  Obviously, won't be a return customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-del-rio,,,,,
14,Damian G.,"Humble, TX",5,92,17.0,3.0,2015-03-27,"hey its Chilis.  lets not get too excited or hostile.  the food was predictable for up scale chain which is what they are.  service was AOK. and food was fresh hot, on time and pretty good.  not a bad value to the prices paid.  I will say they do offer a pretty darned good bacon cheese burger and folks were raving about the mini burgers as well.  I'd go back there if I'm in the area again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-del-rio,,,,,
10,Brandy M.,"Del Rio, TX",8,5,,4.0,2015-04-01,"The service is usually good. We are regulars, and they seem to appreciate and value the opinions of their customers. The menu has various new items, and the taste is on point. This is our go to restaurant in town.  I would recommend it",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-del-rio,,,,,
9,Murphy S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",44,21,6.0,5.0,2015-05-17,Everything was great tonight!! The food was good and the place is very clean. The staff is nice and funny.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-del-rio,,,,,
5,Kirk H.,"Hickory Creek, TX",6,13,,1.0,2016-02-24,"I can't think of a place where I've received worse service. No, check that, no service.  10 minutes of being ignored in an empty bar is my limit.  Oh, I should mention that this was their second chance after a similar experience a month ago.  Worst Chili's ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-del-rio,,,,,
4,George M.,"Katy, TX",33,20,5.0,2.0,2016-05-10,"Dry ribs, no ice in iced tea waitress missing. I can see why Chillis nationwide are struggling.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-del-rio,,,,,
6,Jenna B.,"Laughlin AFB, TX",0,30,1.0,2.0,2016-09-04,"After hearing how bad the service was I waited 2 years before going. It's better than a few place in this town but can use some work. Our waitress was very friendly (thankfully), but she did need some work on checking on us an so on. The food was great, but dang that place needs to be cleaned. Smells like nasty feet, there is food all over the walls & the chairs an tables do not get wiped down properly. They really need to clean the place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-del-rio,,,,,
3,Marie A.,"Houston, TX",0,5,,1.0,2016-12-22,If this is a typical Chili's I will not be going to another.  Mediocre food.  Music playing so loud we couldn't hear each other across the table.  I liked Chili's 'back in the day' but now I can't see how they stay in business.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-del-rio,,,,,
1,Antonio V.,"Alpine, TX",0,2,,1.0,2017-02-27,"Warning: if you sit in the Bar area to dine & drink be ready for a long wait.  The manager has cut ""labor almost down to zero"" to get his bonus!$ The bar tender & ONE waitress will attempt to cover  15 tables plus the patio area, plus the Bar area.  Drinks will take a while & meals even longer. Otherwise ok ******** ******** Went back again Saturday night 2/25/17 & the same  ""slow service in the Bar area"". The waitress is NOT trained properly ... nor does the bartender give much interest in serving.  You practically need to flag them down for service.  Sorry, but they won't get my business nor my clients when you town. Really poor business attitude in general !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-del-rio,,,,,
2,H V.,"Laredo, TX",0,100,9.0,3.0,2017-05-25,"Your typical chilis, the service is hit and miss. Food same thing. A bit dated, definitely needs a remodel. Good lunch specials and happy hour",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-del-rio,,,,,
0,Cliff B.,"Edinburg, TX",7,204,1318.0,4.0,2017-07-27,"I've been to this Chili's a couple of times before. They do a good business and have always done well for me.   I met up with some good friends to catch up and have a meal together. Everything went really well. The only thing I would've changed is if they could have turn the music down some.  I actually enjoyed the music (70's and 80's pop), but it was loud enough I had a difficult time holding a conversation.   I ordered the margarita grilled chicken which is basically their take on Applebees' ""tequila lime chicken"" one of my favorites.   Our server was very attentive (other than not being able to turn the music down), friendly and engaging. Our food was delicious. Everyone was satisfied all around.    We were at the back of the dining room right where the servers were going in and out of the kitchen, so it was a little bit busier than other booths. But the dining room is pleasant and the food is good.  I recommend them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-del-rio,,,,,
