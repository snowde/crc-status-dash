17,Ros Rio R.,"DeLand, FL",8,145,205.0,1.0,2012-07-22,"Just not good @ all! Old soggy fries, dried out Chix and burgers, horrible kids meals, and slow service. Let's just say our first place to visit after this meal was the CLOSEST restroom, I think you get my point. Over priced lousy food prepared with apparent disregard for the customer, sad. Latest news.... A DeLand man and Deltona woman have been charged with organized fraud after officials say they used bank card information the man stole from customers he served at a DeLand Chili's restaurant and spent $24,000.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-deland,,,,,
19,John S.,"DeLand, FL",0,2,,5.0,2013-09-12,"I go to this Chili's all the time.  The food is always great, and so are the drinks.  I never had a problem with the staff.  There is one woman I always try to get when she is working, she is so sweet!   The man that was stealing credit card information was fired, prosecuted, and sent to jail.  I know this because a friend of mine works under his girlfriend.  It is unfortunate, but it can happen anywhere.   You have to be careful wherever you use your card and monitor your bank account.   Please don't let the actions of one terrible previous employee taint your judgement for this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-deland,,,,,
16,Trish D.,"DeLand, FL",16,82,,5.0,2014-08-08,This is one of our favorite places in DeLand. All of these other negative reviews are a surprise to me since we have always had good service and great food and drinks here. We do prefer to sit in the bar area and there are a couple of servers there who recognize us. They all work very hard and we enjoy our meals here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-deland,,,,,
6,Dave O.,"New Smyrna Beach, FL",655,2374,8207.0,3.0,2014-08-11,Tex-Mex en un sit down restaurante de comida rápida. It tough to get excited about Chili's. This location is always busy at lunch I think it's more about the convenience than about the food. I don't come here often but I do come here because the service is always good and it's fast. The restaurant always seems clean and the food is predictable and the lunch specials are reasonable. Don't expect outstanding but this chain has a niche that works and I've never had a bad experience so I'm sure I will return when the need arises. Plenty of parking and easy access in and out.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-deland,,,,,
15,Todd L.,"De Leon Springs, FL",0,1,,1.0,2015-02-24,Absolutely  the worst place I have ever ate or been in my life if I owner this place every body in the place would be fired and looking for a job,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-deland,,,,,
9,Matt F.,"DeLand, FL",6,64,11.0,2.0,2015-06-07,"Servers were pleasant but the food was mediocre at best. Restaurant was nearly empty when we arrived. My favorite meal, the chicken fried steak, had been removed from the menu. Bad call there Chili's.  Burgers were good but fries and onion rings were bitter. Most likely old oil in the fryers.  Small sides as well. I think I counted a total of six onion rings and they weren't very big. My wife ordered a chicken strip salad. It was soggy and shredded. Will I be back? If someone gives me a gift card maybe otherwise probably not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-deland,,,,,
18,Gary B.,"DeLand, FL",0,13,,3.0,2015-06-26,Gave it another chance for lunch.  Food and service good.  Moms left little ones at home.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-deland,,,,,
13,Jerry D.,"Altamonte Springs, FL",436,14,5.0,5.0,2015-08-03,"Been coming here for the past 3 weeks since I working up in Deland. The food is amazing here, make sure you try their chilli and they Panko Onion Rings. I usually sit at the bar since I done by myself. Richard the bartender is amazing, always friendly and prompt service. I would def. Recommend this place if you up this way. Great prices, great food and great drinks. What else could you ask for. Food always comes out quick and they really do care about their customers here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-deland,,,,,
10,John C.,"Ormond Beach, FL",261,1256,3007.0,3.0,2015-09-30,This is your usual Chili's Restaurant.  You know the menu and the usual decor.  The staff at this location is fine and seems attentive.  It is always very busy if you are coming in at Lunch or dinner so give yourself time.  The food is OK but that is my feeling for all of the Chili's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-deland,,,,,
12,Eva B.,"DeLand, FL",15,3,,2.0,2016-03-18,"Very bland food tonight. Food came out with missing ingredients. They offered to remake it, but this was after the waitress had already messed up submitting our order. We didn't want to wait even longer! Just decided to to not come back. Our waitress talked down to to us the whole time, even telling us how we should eat our food. Annoying.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-deland,,,,,
14,Rachel V.,"DeLand, FL",0,2,,5.0,2016-06-10,Best service and food. Had a great experience tonight with this location. Always top notch.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-deland,,,,,

1,William P.,"Charleston, SC",848,585,4651.0,4.0,2017-02-11,"Restaurant is located on the Main Street in Deland: close to the airport. Food is good. Saturday night 2 beers for the price of one. Service is not fast, but the places was some kind of busy. Good atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-deland,,,,,
4,Lindsey P.,"Orange City, FL",18,38,129.0,4.0,2017-02-26,"The atmosphere is good for family, friends and also a late night hangout at the bar. All of the food was amazing except the Cajun chicken pasta. The Cajun chicken pasta was a little dry not much sauce. Also for those that are scared to try it for fear that it will be spicy, it is not spicy. The staff was wonderful and very attentive but not overly attentive. It was a bit Busy but we got right in. One thing I liked seeing was the manager walking around on the floor talking to customers and helping the staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-deland,,,,,
2,Gina B.,"DeLand, FL",6,21,15.0,2.0,2017-03-04,"I love chilis but this particular location is hit or miss. Its better to go during lunch than dinner. The queso dip was cold and the chips overly salty. Our waitress was horrible and did not pay attention to our order. I got the wrong order and was overcharged. When I brought this to her attention she just argued about it and nothing was fixed. If you go here be lucky enough to NOT get kaitlyn as your waitress , she sucks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-deland,,,,,
8,Sherry M.,"DeLand, FL",39,100,196.0,2.0,2017-03-04,"Like so many establishments in Deland, I find that this Chili's is much better during the day than in the evening. My wife and I stopped in tonight for what we hoped would be a nice little date, but then we were cursed with one of the worst servers I've ever had. We started our meal with the chips and queso. Normally, I wouldn't order the queso, but we had a coupon. The chips were warm and crisp. The salsa was fresh and yummy, but the queso was luke warm at best, which only brought out an unpleasant salty flavor. Luckily the coupon made it free as we barely touched it. I ordered a Smokehouse bacon burger (with no bbq sauce) and fries (without seasoning) and some panko onion rings to share. When my food arrived, there was bbq sauce, no fries, and 4 over cooked onion rings (at $1.99 to add a side thats ridiculous) I told the guy who brought the food and went and grabbed me some fries, which of course had the seasoning I didn't want. My wife, feeling more 'snacky' than 'mealy' had ordered a Triple Dipper with (2) big mouth burger bites, southwest eggrolls, and boneless buffalo wings. That is what she ordered, not what she received. She got a Tripple dipper. It had the eggrolls. The burger bites were actually 1 1/2 bites as 1/2 of one of the burgers was bun only. Her boneless buffalo wings never arrived. Instead, she was given a couple of chicken strips. I wanted to send it back, as my wife was super disappointed, but she insisted on keeping what she was served as it had taken forever to get what we were given. It was as if the waitress had written down our order in a manner that was opposite of everything that we asked for. We only saw her again when it was time to pay the bill, which was inaccurate and had to be adjusted by nearly $10. I'm usually a good tipper, but I only gave her 5% as she chose to argue with me rather than fix her mistake when I showed her what she'd done. I'm usually super mellow and easy going, but she's awful. I would've spoken to the manager, but I had a dealing with him once before which was unproductive and frustrating. We love Chilis but tonight was the last time this location gets our money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-deland,,,,,
5,Erin D.,"Miami, FL",3,24,40.0,4.0,2017-06-03,"I love this place. It's a great hang out location and the staff is simply amazing. They are incredibly friendly and kind. They treat their regulars like family, and go the extra mile to take care of them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-deland,,,,,
7,Rena B.,"Hazlehurst, GA",0,29,1.0,5.0,2017-07-09,Food was great as well as service. Soup was hot and Big Mouth burgers were yummy. We enjoy eating at Chili's but sometimes they can be just average. This one was really good. Restrooms could use some attention but our service was great!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-deland,,,,,
0,Ashlyn P.,"DeLand, FL",29,4,,4.0,2017-09-26,Nicer and cleaner than the Chili's in Orange City... the staff is always friendly when I go.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-deland,,,,,
3,Mary C.,"DeLand, FL",15,22,31.0,1.0,2017-10-01,"I gave them one star because the manager arrived at our table within minutes of our request and offered to give our dinner at no charge. Only one star because although everything started out well, it went south quickly after our order was taken and the food was delivered to our table. Long story short, of the 2 soup and salad orders, one salad was served with onions and frozen cucumbers after I requested no onion and both soups were served lukewarm. I will add, even though the loaded potato and chicken tortilla soups were ""cold"" they did have good flavor. We are local to the area so this location not only missed out on our business tonight, but also potential business in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-deland,,,,,
