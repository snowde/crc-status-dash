18,Barb A.,"Riverside, NJ",0,1,,1.0,2012-09-22,"The worst service we ever had at this local Chili's. My family has been going here since it opened without a problem.  However, today when my husband and I went there for lunch the food was inconsistant with what they usually serve and the service was horrible. Our waitress kept dissapearing and when we finally flagged her down to tell her we were unhappy with our food she gave us attitude. When the food came back out wrong again we asked for the check. We didn't eat our meals, but were still billed full price. To add insult to injury, the waitress came over with our change and lectured us on how we ordered our meal wrong. At no time during our visit was a floor manager visable, let alone available to handle our problem. This resturaunt is close to our home and convenient for a quick bite, but we will never go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-delran?start=20,2.02,2.02,2.02,2.02,2.02

There was no host at the door so people just walked in and were standing around, we had to go in and ask a waiter to get the host. The silverwear was very dirty and the food wasn't good. I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and it wasn't grilled, the chicken was white and like it was rushed and not thoroughly cooked. I told them no honey mustard sauce and my bottom bread was saturated with all the sauce leaking out of it. We ordered mild chicken for my little brother and it was covered in hot sauce, it even smelled really spicy. the waitress told us that all the mild wings are made the same way, that would have been useful info to provode when we were ordering and asked for non spicy chicken for a child. We had no choice but to order honey chicken because he couldn't eat that. His food didn't come until we had already finished eating and were ready for the check, then we had to take it to go.

16,Kat D.,"Riverton, NJ",0,13,,1.0,2013-09-23,"Let me just say that deciding to go to this Chili's earlier this week was probably one of the worst decisions I'd made in months.  My husband and I had our newborn with us and we needed dinner and had an errand to run in the Target next door. We decided to place a To-Go order and then run to Target, pick up our food and go home and eat it. Sounds simple, right? First, I went into the restaurant to grab a menu - there was no hostess at the door. There were two waitresses who were wandering around the restaurant aimlessly. They had the vacant stares of dead hookers. They made no attempt to make contact with me, and I don't think they even went to the handful of tables that were seated.  The bartender looked busy but she didn't acknowledge that I was there either. I waited about 5 minutes, and then reached over the hostess stand and got myself my own menus. I went back to the car, and my husband and I decided what we wanted and he went back in to order for us.  Again, there was no hostess, and when the waitresses saw that he wanted to order, they disappeared into the kitchen. He had to wait for the bartender (who was busy serving a semi-full bar) to place the order. She apparently had called out to the other staff for help and they never came out of the kitchen. It took him about 10 minutes to place the order. Our car was parked near the kitchen window, and I could see about a half dozen people standing back there, snacking, smoking, and chatting.  We went to Target, were gone about 25-30 minutes, and came back to the restaurant.  THEY GAVE OUR ORDER TO SOMEONE ELSE!!!!  We were starving at this point, so we waited for them to re-cook our meal. I would expect that we should get a portion of our meal comp'd for their mishap, but no such deal.  Overall, it took over an hour for us to place our order, wait for the to-go order, and then actually leave with our food.  Which was awful by the way.  We got an appetizer plate with soggy food, my shrimp tacos were full of lettuce and had maybe a total of 4 shrimp between all 3 tacos, and the container was handed to us upside down. So basically I got a salad, some errant shrimp and a soggy burrito wrap in styrofoam. My husband's chicken tacos were essentially in the same sad state. If you are looking to waste your time and your money,, and only get disgusting food, piss poor service, and probably dysentery, then this is the restaurant for you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-delran?start=20,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18
9,Max W.,"Hamilton, NJ",2,29,21.0,4.0,2013-11-10,"Came around 1130 and the place was almost empty, meaning the servers had nothing to do and I'd get fed faster!

17,James L.,"Riverside, NJ",6,12,,1.0,2014-05-05,"OK... I understand Chili's is a ""chain""; but this is not so much about the food, which is adequate at best. This is about the service. We were a party of six.... two of us served, one order incorrect. The waitress disappears. Ten minutes later she brings the balance of the order to our table. One order is incorrect once again. My rice and broccoli are cold... the salmon is hot. Then my drink arrives, which was ordered twenty minutes prior. The waitress disappears once again, then makes an appearance fifteen minutes later. My daughter orders a drink. It never shows until we are ready to leave.  I find this type of service incomprehensible. Doesn't Chili's train their staff? Maybe the waitress was new... if so, she should have had some help. This was a Monday evening, the place wasn't crowded at all. I think management should take a long hard look at their training methods, and hopefully improve this dreadful situation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-delran?start=20,2.052,2.052,2.052,2.052,2.052
3,DeWayne G.,"Riverside, NJ",62,193,163.0,2.0,2014-06-01,"I usually get the chicken fajitas everytime I stop in. This time is no different. I like the vibe here. The restaurant is about 4 years old. The staff is friendly.Sadly once our meals arrived, the experience was not fun anymore. My fajitas were warm, not sizzling hot, my wife had the parmesan chicken & shrimp. Her dish was warm, not hot, the cheese covering the chicken wasnt really melted, due to the chicken not being hot enough to melt it. Her broccoli was cold. She spoke with the manager about her plate, she got salmon to replace the shrimp. The manager took the price of her meal off of the bill. That was a plus; however it was still a sad outing. Its amazing how much this place has slipped a lot since it opened. Sadly, we wont be coming back to this particular Chili's in the near future.

Potato-bacon-cheese soup was really good but in a tiny cup, for $4.00. I know I only ordered a cup, but this thing was so small. Just a little disappointing, $2.50 would have been more like it for what they serve. At any rate, it was very good and that sort of saved the whole soup experience. Rarely go to Chilis, but stopped off while working on the road. They cooked my burger perfectly (ordered it medium).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-delran?start=20,2.252,2.252,2.252,2.252,2.252

The service was never that great, but the food was decent and it was close to our home, so we went a lot. However, we noticed it really going downhill the last few times in both food and service. Last night was the last straw. First we were seated by a mute host. Then waited 15 minutes to be acknowledged by our server. Half hour wait for the appetizer. Appetizer was brought to someone else's table. Meanwhile was cooling off while they figured out who it belonged to. Tasted old/heat lamp stale. Another long wait for our entrees. My entree tasted like it was days old. Mind you, the place was EMPTY so there was no excuse for the long waits and heat lamp food. Nothing ticks me off more than these places that think their customers should spend their hard-earned paychecks on poor service and poor food.

I've worked in Delran for almost 8 years and have tried to have good experiences here but every, single time I come here, the service is absolutely awful. Tonight when I got here, it took over 25 mins to be seated and get a margarita, which was the whole point of my visit.l, watching the bartender make drinks for people that got there after us. I had to literally get up from my booth, look for a manager, and he himself made the margaritas which I couldn't even drink because it tasted so awful. Not to mention I had expressed a food allergy to my waiter and was brought 3 items that I specifically asked not to have due to my allergy, so had to wait EVEN longer for my food I didn't even want to eat. The food itself wasn't even worth eating but by that point I was so hungry I needed to have something. My friend ordered the shrimp fajitas only to find one being raw and not cooked thoroughly and she stopped eating at that point. The manager was less than helpful and explained it was his first night at the location which was a lie because the last time my friend ate here, he was the manager she had to speak to. He comped our entire meal which didn't do anything to satisfy any of us considering the frustration we had to encounter during the duration of our visit here.  Overall, an absolute disgrace and terrible experience as usual and I hope no one wastes a dime out of their pocket to go to this ridiculously lousy establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-delran?start=20,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36

We ordered two kids Mac and cheese, Cajun shrimp pasta, and a guacamole burger. My daughters broccoli was literally rotted. The florets were pale and the bottoms were BLACK. Told the waitress and she gave me attitude. Never once did she apologize. I'm a waitress so I get a lot of stuff isn't the servers fault, but if a cook puts rotted broccoli in the window, don't serve it, definitely not to my 6 year old. My sons mashed potatoes were room temperature at best, but it honestly worked out cause he's 1 so he likes his food that way. I ordered Cajun shrimp pasta, I received Cajun chicken pasta. The garlic bread was amazing, and I was honestly heart broken that my 1 year old stole it. The pasta however wasn't even cooked. I even asked my husband to make sure I wasn't crazy, and he agreed, and he usually never agrees with me . So we waited literally 7 minutes to see our waitress again, and I told her, once again came the attitude. That of course was not her fault (besides it being chicken and not shrimp) she told the manager and he took it off. He spent most of the night standing around gossiping about another waitress calling and giving her notice or something, whilst the notice played on her phone the whole time. Never once did he come apologize or acknowledge the raw pasta or rotted broccoli my family received. We will never ever go back. It was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had.

29,Lisa D.,"Portland, ME",79,10,,1.0,2017-04-18,This place is awful with awful customer service.  When I walked in my phone was dead and I asked if I could plug in my phone.  The manager Sean informed me there was no place I could plug in my phone.  I then waited at the bar for 20 minutes only to be ignored.  Finally when my running group ended our run there we were refused to be served.  The tip would have been huge for the employees but the manager Sean was awful.  He should be fired.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-delran,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
25,Abigail P.,"Edgewater Park, NJ",59,57,11.0,1.0,2017-07-23,"Chili's I just can't with you anymore.  I.  JUST.  CAN'T.  (I seriously hate that saying, but it applies here and is pretty perfect.)   We haven't been here since my last review, and thought we would give it another shot bc it IS Chili's after all.... certain things are always good on the menu.   But now they've gone and changed the classics.  The fajita's are awful now.  Bland and greasy and I'm pretty sure I ate raw chicken.  The guacamole that comes with it was brown.  BROWN.  Why would you even send that out on a plate?   Hubby sent back the ribs bc he said (I kid you not) ""they taste the way a new car smells!""  I tasted them and he was right!  They really do taste like that smell!  It was weird and literally disgusting.  He switched to the chicken fajita's as well, and his guac was also brown.   We were seated in the last booth in the bar area and the manager kinda hung out back there.  He looked at our plates MULTIPLE times.  If he had ever actually come to our table since we DID complain and send food back, he might have noticed the BROWN guac on both plates.  Although, I know he noticed it.  He just didn't care.   Our server was once again the saving grace of the Chili's experience.  She was so sweet and understanding.  But I can't give out stars for this anymore.  When management doesn't even care about guests, it really effects the WHOLE restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-delran,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
24,Shaina W.,"Hendersonville, NC",0,24,1.0,1.0,2017-09-04,"Worst experience at a Chilis to date. Slow and terrible service although they only had one section open. Our waitress came to our table 3 times. To take our drink and appetizer order, to deliver our appetizer and take our food order, and to deliver our food. There was a span of roughly 15-20 minutes between each of those visits that felt like forever which could have been easily remedied with good customer service.  We had to hunt her down to get a refill on water, and she never came to bring us our bill. Had we not been honest people, we could have very easily just up and left without paying. But, we used the kiosk at the table, and left very disgruntled.  Food was cold, but somewhat decent.  Not returning to this location unfortunately.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-delran,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32
26,Nicole M.,"City of Burlington, NJ",124,2,,1.0,2017-12-31,"VERY disappointed . The waitress started out well by taking our order promptly but then it went downhill. After about 30 minutes, we had to track the waitress down for refills on our drinks. At this point we still have not received any of the appetizers that we ordered. There was a group of people who received their food first even though they came in after us . Our food finally came after ONE HOUR and 15 MINUTEs later and it was COLD ! The waitress dropped the food off and left. When she came back she asked ""any boxes?"" Now why would we want a box for a cold disgusting meal. She kept blaming the mistakes on her ""pregnancy brain "". We talked to the manager who only apologized and wouldn't offer us any future coupons or anything else . Will not return to this chillis. VERY unhappy customer as it ruined our night out with friends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-delran,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28
