27,Nikki C.,"National Park, NJ",33,30,89.0,5.0,2013-06-02,I love Chilis. My favorite night is Monday for the fajita and margarita special.  Happy hour is great 4-6- I always go with the margarita for 1/2 price. Chips with fresh salsa and the chili con queso (cheese dip) is addictive. The chili lime soup is excellent and the lunch specials provide a large variety to choose from and are reasonably priced.  I have always had great service at the Deptford location and recommend it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-deptford?start=20,2.7399999999999998,2.7399999999999998,2.7399999999999998,2.7399999999999998,2.7399999999999998
34,Shannon M.,"West Berlin, NJ",142,354,21.0,4.0,2013-06-21,"Stopped in for an afternoon snack after jonesing for some chips and salsa.  Katie waited on us and was fabulous.  She brought us new drinks when we were both at the halfway point.   We decided to order some southwest egg rolls as well.  Katie brought us more chips while we waited.  The chips are perfect in their thinness and saltiness.  So delish.  The egg rolls were just spicy enough and served very hot.   The service is usually good, but I think our visit with Katie was probably the best yet.  Our last visit was less than favorable with a snotty bartender who was obviously put out by having to do stuff like pour our drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-deptford?start=20,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997
31,Ben W.,"Woodbury, NJ",56,98,7.0,3.0,2013-08-20,"It's a sad day in America when Chili's has a nearly perfect Yelp rating. Deptford, I am disappointed in you!  This particular location is nice, for a Chili's. I've eaten here a couple of times and wasn't disappointed. The service was pretty good, the wait wasn't too long, and the food was okay. I had realistic expectations and they were met.  But 4 to 5 star ratings? Come on, people. You obviously don't get out much. Even at this price level you can do MUCH better. -Want a better burger for the same price? Go to 25 Burgers in Woodbury, or Five Guys right around the corner from here.  -Want better ribs? Go literally anywhere that sells them. That song was a lie. Notice how they stopped playing it? -Want a better club sandwich? Go to Rastelli's Market Fresh, right down the street. -Want a better salad or pasta? You must be lost, because this is not the place to go for that. Oh well, go to Filomena's or Marlina, right around the other sides of the mall. -Want better bar food? Like buffalo wings, poppers, etc.? Go anywhere! It's the same freezer-to-fryer crap wherever you go. If you find an exception to this rule, PLEASE let me know. I'd love to get my mouth on some real homemade crispy fatstuff. I should reiterate, however, that Chili's is not bad; they're still worth stopping in if you're craving them. But personally, I feel that while the familiarity of a large chain does bring a certain reliability when you're not feeling adventurous, more often than not I find that privately owned restaurants are worth the gamble.

Decided on chipotle chicken crispers and fajitas with some guacamole. Arrived about the time the online order confirmation said it would be ready but to my dismay they had no order whatsoever for me. The friendly girl at the pickup counter said she received attitude from the bartender when she inquired about it, apparently that is where the online orders get printed. She said sometimes there are glitches in the online ordering system. Regardless, she said they would add a free appetizer if I decided to place a new order and wait for it, about 20 minutes. I said no problem. It was ready in about 15 and it was worth the wait. Not only did she add a free appetizer (mozz sticks) she added a big bag of chips and some salsa.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-deptford?start=20,2.352,2.352,2.352,2.352,2.352

25,Tommy J.,"Voorhees Township, NJ",6,106,8.0,2.0,2015-03-14,"I used to enjoy Chili's back in the day particularly their quesadillas and turkey burger.  The turkey burger was great.  Visits to the Marlton Chili's were something to look forward to. However, I think chain restaurants have changed.  Less quality and more quantity.  We had a number of entrees including onion rings, fajitas, quesadillas and enchiladas.  One word ... greasy.  Way too greasy.  I had a similar experience at Friday's.  Just not good as they used to be.   That being said the portions were pretty big.  In fact the leftovers made for two more dinners.  I can't imagine eating all of it in one seating.  Also, the 2 for $20 is a great deal.       Bottomline.  Chain restaurants cater to a certain crowd who don't adventure outside the norm.  Reasonable food for reasonable prices.  If this sounds like you then you'll love Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-deptford?start=20,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152

The chicken did not look like it touched a grill but was cooked in a microwave. Another entree was Cajun pasta, the macaroni was hard as if it was reheated too long.

38,Catherine L.,"Sewell, NJ",0,5,,1.0,2015-04-18,"We are a party of 6 requiring 1 highchair.  We arrived at Chili's just about 9 pm, and of course Chili's does not accept reservations, which we called to make earlier in the day.  We arrived and they took my daughter's name and we proceeded to wait without being offered an approximate wait time.  Meanwhile, parties of 2-4 were arriving and being seated almost immediately, or told the wait was 5 minutes.  My daughter works in the industry and of course, was scouting out areas in the restaurant and saw a large booth near the bar, however, we were not offered that area, nor were we offered the patio like area where there was semi-outdoor dining.  After waiting for 20 minutes, I asked one of the hosts how long they thought our wait would be.  The curt answer I received was ""I don't know we have a lot of large parties right now and we don't know when they will be done.""  Really??? you don't have any idea?  Who is running this restaurant and why don't they know?  10 minutes later a different host said they were cleaning up a table for us now, which apparently took another 10 minutes.  When we were shown to our table, the seats were still wet from being wiped down, and we were expected to sit on wet seats.  When I tried to flag down a server for a dry towel or napkin to dry the seats, he just ignored me.  So we basically sat in a wet booth, 4 adults, a 3 year old and a one and a half year old.  Our server, Colin, greeted us and took our drink order.  2 diet cokes, 1 coke, 1 water with lemon, and 2 kids apple juices.   This took another 10 minutes for the sodas and longer for the apple juice because he said he had to get that at the bar.  When he came back with the apple juice we ordered our appetizer and my daughter said she wanted the kids mac and cheese put down at the same time because the children were hungry.  We also ordered our main meal at that time.  Again, after waiting entirely too long he brought out the appetizer and no mac and cheese for the kids.  He left the table and then came back to ask how the appetizer was and my daughter asked him where the mac and cheese was.  He replied by oh yes(in otherwords he forgot)went to the kitchen and brought it back.  This food was basically dead in the window.  The corn on the cob was served cold.  The children liked the mac and cheese.  We waited again a long time for our food to be brought out and were finally served dinner. Two in our party ordered food with wedges and were served their food with fries.  The server told us at that time, they must have been out of wedges so they just substituted fries for it.  Really?? at who's consideration was that.  If you don't have a side that someone asked for you should be asking the person which other side they would like, not just giving them what you feel like making.  At the time dinner was brought out, my daughter ordered a strawberry margarita.  I paid close to $7. for a drink that wasn't even drinkable and was never brought to the table until we were all just about done eating.  The server came back a couple of times sometimes greeting us from the correct side of the table and sometimes from the half wall, which I found inappropriate.  He came and asked if we wanted desert and I told him to bring our check immediately.  In the meantime my daughter left the table to talk to the manager and my other daughter took the, now fussing, 1 year old outside so it wouldn't disturb the few remainging guests.  The server said we could pay from the kiosk if we were using a credit card.  I told him I had a gift card and credit card, so he brought me the check at 10:43, which I was ready to pay immediately and he disappeared yet again.  He finally came back and said, ""are your ready to pay""  I said it's been sitting there since you handed it to me.  He took the payment and returned a few minutes later, at which time the manager came back to the table with my daughter and said, ""Oh you already paid the bill, if I had known before you paid I could have made an adjustment to the bill.""  This also is untrue, and I can't believe, even after my daughter told him she worked in the industry, and knows that if the manager wanted to he could have adjusted any part of that charge.  Instead the manager just said that at our next visit, he will take care of us.  Well my daughter may go back there, because the food is very good, however, I will not go back to that Chili's again. As an aside, I did tip the server, and only because, my daughter is in the industry.  However, even with the service being as bad as it was, I still gave the server a 13% tip, which was way more than he earned or deserved.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-deptford?start=20,2.052,2.052,2.052,2.052,2.052
21,Cynthia H.,"Tonawanda, NY",15,58,22.0,5.0,2015-08-14,"I am ultra impressed with the new features, and foods that are offered at this Chili's location. I was very pleased with the varieties of food that came to our table. My daughter's and son in law both enjoyed their meals. The variety of foods that is offered is great. They have really stepped up their game. It's hidden mostly too, right there on Clements, like a hidden gem. Their chips and salsa alone are worth going there for. This has really revitalized my opinion of Chili's as a whole. We really enjoyed it, and the service was TOP NOTCH. Not one mistake. We really liked it a great deal. And their bottomless soup and salad is less expensive than the Olive Garden version and better tasting in my opinion. The appetizer special was really great too, with homemade hand dipped fried pickles, southwest eggrolls, they have 4 different types of Queso, and their tortilla chips are fresh made, They even have a table side guacamole feature where they come to the table and make the guacamole right in front of you and serve it with fresh homemade chips.

33,Patricia B.,"Sicklerville, NJ",0,13,,3.0,2015-09-02,"Stopped in here for lunch and was excited to see the deep fried pickles on the menu. When I received these, half had no coating and were stuck together in stacks so it was basically a basket of hot pickles, yuck! The baked potato soup was amazing and the burger was good as were the fries. Service was fast and friendly. This visit would have been a 4-5 star if the appetizer had not been inedible. I also felt like the restaurant chain could better utilize the terminals on every table. Why not make them a benefit to customers as a perk to eating at your chain instead of just trying to use them to make more money? You could only order drink refills if they were alcoholic and a charge for even a simple trivia game? I can do that on my smart phone for free, you are missing the boat on this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-deptford?start=20,2.252,2.252,2.252,2.252,2.252

It was busy when we got there, which was expected since we went during dinner at 7 pm. We were told the wait was going to be 20-30 minutes, but we were seated within 5 minutes. Our waitor was very attentive and our appetizer was out within a matter of minutes and our meals were on the table within 10-15 minutes, which was surprising considering how busy it was. Overall, the place was packed but we still got our meals fast and our waitor was great. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and we will definitely be coming back.

Our waiter was nice, that was pretty much the only ""highlight"" of our meal I guess. Every time that I have come to this Chili's I've had a horrible experience. The last time I ordered a chicken dish and I got this dry, crusty slice of chicken with tortilla bits thrown on it and uncooked rice. This time I thought that it was going to be better. I ordered a Mex bowl and my boyfriend ordered pasta. We waited at least 45 minutes for our food to be cooked. When our food arrived, my bowl was completely ice cold. Nothing tasted cooked and, once again, I had uncooked rice, plus what was listed in the description was not in my food. I decided not to eat it. My boyfriend  had found multiple hairs in his food. It was disgusting. His meal was supposed to come with garlic bread, once we received that only one side was toasted. We talked to the manager and he refunded only the meals (which we understood, we got drinks as well). Our waiter was understanding, we left him a fair tip.

Looking up you could see globs of dust on ledges, blinds etc. The waitress, Janae according to the receipt, brought water fast but no straws. Apparently the straws are supposed to be in the utensil bags (it looks like they may outsource cleaning?) Either way, not her fault whatsoever if they are meant to be in that bag. We could hear issues in the kitchen being so close Nd didnt see her for a long period of time. Drink finally arrived, dripping all over since it sat at the bar so long. Again, still not her fault if the kitchen was as backed up as it seemed. She was very professional addressing the long wait, Huge kudos to her because I know how it can be when things pile up!  Appetizer finally came out and was honestly delicious and hot.  The food came out really fast after before we were done the app. His salad was kind of a disaster and my corn had zero seasoning and my pickles were missing. A runner brought it so again, kitchen at fault. He hated his salad, my food was very good, when I finally got them the pickles were killer.

4,Alex P.,"Bellmawr, NJ",93,136,10.0,2.0,2017-06-03,We were given a gift card and decided to use it  Full disclosure I had an extremely poor experience at this location probably 15 or more years ago and have not set foot in a chilis since  Wednesday night seated promptly wait staff friendly  A group walks in with three kids seated a few tables away the child screeches continuously no parent disciplined the child and the wait staff and management did nothing to try to insure other patrons had a pleasant experience.  I know it's a chain restaurant and family oriented but there is a point where if parents are inept management needs to step in  We ordered steak with shrimp and asparagus with mashed potatoes  they accommodated plain mashed with no issues    The asparagus were overly seasoned and needed to have the salt and pepper wiped off... barely edible the entire meal too salty steak tasty but over seasoned Shrimp tacos very tasty the rice overdone and dry I substituted fries for beans they were hot tasty but way over salted  Cheesecake for dessert very good accommodated strawberry goo Ilona the side  The calorie counts on the meals are scary best not to look at them if you want to enjoy your meal I don't understand how some of the menu items are so high in caloric content  Margarita very tasty and plentiful  Well in all honesty they stepped up their game from years ago but still have a long way to go.... On my way to the bathroom I passed the kitchen and saw a wait staff eating on a food prep area.  That did not make me feel good but overall I thought the place was clean and well kept  The checkout kiosk on the table is slightly confusing and did not print our receipt  Beware mAny people in shorts and flip flops with their ugly Fred flintstone feet making the dining experience less than savory,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-deptford,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
3,Joe K.,"Princeton, NJ",38,146,217.0,2.0,2017-06-07,"Went back here because I had to use some gift cards someone gave to me. The service was much better this time. It was attentive and quick. However, the food was still barely worth eating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-deptford,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
15,Shannon T.,"Middletown, DE",9,12,2.0,1.0,2017-07-11,"AWFUL. Wasn't greeted for 7 mins, told the bartender and then wasn't greeted still for about 4 more minutes. Server didn't care at all, got my order wrong and there wasn't a manager in sight. Also it was a slow Monday night. No excuse for why this happened. Avoid at all cost.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-deptford,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
14,Maria M.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",1,4,1.0,5.0,2017-07-24,"I am confused about all the reviews under 5 stars. My family and I have been going to chills for years and have never had a bad experience. The service is very quick, we are always in and out within an hour. We hardly eat at any other restaurant! The staff is very friendly and accommodating. After we have been seated there were times we wanted to move to a table near a tv so we could watch the sports game on and the server was happy to move us. The 2 for 22 deal is unbeatable. The texas cheese fries are amazing, all real cheese and not the fake wiz. The honey barbecue boneless wings and cheeseburger sliders are also delicious for appetizers. My family always orders the fajitas, quesadillas, chicken crispers, and burgers. All very tasty. You can't leave chills without getting the chocolate molten cake!!! 10x better then applebees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-deptford,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6

1,Steve A.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,19,,2.0,2017-12-27,"The staff was friendly, the classic nachos sucked. In years past, this used to be a half-decent chain restaurant.  Now it seems they've gone the way of Applebees, everything is microwaved for your pleasure. Oh, and extra-salted.  Just dump the whole shaker on there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-deptford,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
