45,Harvey A.,"Lyndhurst, NJ",254,207,336.0,3.0,2012-01-11,"I have a love-hate relationship with this place. I'm seldom in the mood to go here, but when I do it's usually good.  Went last week and had a red sangria, the roasted corn guacamole with salsa and chips, and crispy shrimp tacos with rice and black beans. All was delicious. The roasted corn guacamole could have been larger (because it was so scrumptious). The crispy shrimp tacos looked slim BUT tasted great. With the sangria to wash it all down I left full and satisfied. I just don't know why :-/ Wait staff was friendly, but not confident. I like a waiter/waitress with a strong opinion. But all in all, it was a nice experience. I sound so wishy-washy, I know. But that's what Chilis does to me. So, go there??? I guess. I'll be back again someday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-east-rutherford?start=40,2.316,2.316,2.316,2.316,2.316
57,Naja H.,"Hackensack, NJ",31,49,100.0,3.0,2012-05-05,"Went here for Cinco De Mayo and had the El Presidente Margarita with the Nachos Grande and the Fajita Trio. I wasn't impressed with the food at all. However, my server, F, was very friendly and accommodating even though he was extremely busy. The Margarita is usually good, but it was TOO salty here. The Nachos were the best part of the meal (I usually get guacamole with mine).  The Fajito Trio wasn't good at al and I didn't eat it. There were way too many onions which seemed like they were drenched in oil. The shrimp wasn't well done and the chicken tasted WAY too processed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-east-rutherford?start=40,2.252,2.252,2.252,2.252,2.252
67,Thara V.,"Carlstadt, NJ",10,2,,1.0,2012-08-27,"I went to this Chili's location regularly until a few months ago. My last experience was so bad that I will never return.  We were completely ignored by the waitstaff for at least 15 minutes after we were seated. The kitchen area was in view from where I was sitting, and I could see servers on their cell phones, fixing their makeup, etc.  Once we were finally able to place an order, our chips took another 25 minutes to come out. After having sat for 40 minutes before getting an appetizer, we were starving, so we dug in. To my horror, I realized that there was a deep- fried roach on the bottom of the chips basket. When I showed to roach to the manager, he didn't seem surprised. His exact words were, ""Oh, yeah. That's a roach."" We walked out before the rest of the food came out. That's the only time I've had to do that. Chili's corporate was very nice when I contacted them, and I was sent something for my troubles. I will go to Chili's again, just not this location!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-east-rutherford?start=60,1.988,1.988,1.988,1.988,1.988
56,Tracey A.,"Toms River, NJ",24,22,13.0,4.0,2013-01-29,"I frequent this Chili's because it's in a great spot and the wait is usually not long. The place is very clean, and you are seated quickly. I ordered from the 2 for 20.00 menu, the food came out at a reasonable pace. The waitstaff is not the quickest, but they are not the slowest either. I have always had attentive, friendly waiters, and they are pretty consistent on their food. Usually, when I go to other Chilis in the area I am given chips, but this one does not give them to you unless you order them. Overall, the food is good, comes out fast and hot, the waiters that I have dealt with were always personable and helpful. They added some extras to their 2 for 20 menu like cheddar bacon smother steak, and a loaded one. Try this place out, just avoid it when the Jets or Giants are playing in town because a lot of fans eat there before the game and it can get packed!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-east-rutherford?start=40,2.32,2.32,2.32,2.32,2.32
40,Avril N.,"Chatsworth, CA",51,239,65.0,1.0,2013-03-29,My actual rating for this place would be a negative 10. Service was slow and the place itself was so disgustingly dirty. Napkins and food was all over the floor. My cutlery was dirty as well. The worst thing about this place was that there was 1 piece of buffalo wing from our order that was BLOODY inside. It was brought to the manager's attention and all he did was take the appetizer off our bill. My family and I are definitely not EVER coming back to this place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-east-rutherford?start=40,1.956,1.956,1.956,1.956,1.956
59,Maria B.,"Nutley, NJ",0,3,,2.0,2013-03-31,"My husband and I ordered Chilis to Go from here twice within the past month or so as we have quite a bit of $ in gift cards. Last time, I ordered the steak from the ""healthy options"" menu.  Although I requested it Medium - it was most definitely RARE - and as I didn't cut into it until I got it home, it was too late to do anything. Most recently, we ordered chips and salsa with our meals, and they forgot to pack the salsa.  Again, we were home already, and I wasn't about to go back just for salsa.  Not a huge deal (the rest of the food was good), but still an inconvenience.

Most of the waiters/waitresses look  young and are very inexperienced.  The food itself is okay, but it's nothing to write home about.  Our main reason for coming here is probably because of the molten cake which is probably the best thing on the menu.  The coffee also tastes pretty bad and never seems to be hot when served.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-east-rutherford?start=60,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.12

Chili's employees were nowhere to be found. Actually, on my way to the restroom I've found two -sitting and hanging out in a booth. They were there for half an hour or more. Our waitress confessed it was her 2nd day on the job, which is fine of course, but do your job. She promised everything and forgot it all. Like handing out the menus once we were seated, plates, drinks, no special stuff just what we need for/with our meal. She asked a couple of times if all was okay but after I said yes, she ran away, kind of. If I asked her a question I could never ask another one because again, she ran away. Weird! Then she disappeared in the back and took a long time to come out. She was attending 3 booths on her own so it wasn't a lot to cater to (and all 3 happened to be one next to the other).

Served in a short tumbler glass, these make the perfect accompaniment to any dish, but for me I chose to go straight with a Latin style and chose the Chile Tilapia.  While the server promised me it wouldn't be too spicy, well the glaze was Habanero so I wasn't expecting mild. Definitely cleared the sinuses. Service was good, a little slow, but we were relaxed on a Saturday afternoon. My mom got the three pick sampler, was disjointed that the sliders were only two in the basket, but loved the rest.

Then there was the computer thing that we still don't know what we were supposed to do with it... they never explained it and we are not from an area that has this technology.  The waiter was friendly enough.  He upgraded us from fries to some mac and cheese side dish.  He then offered to bring the kids food out ahead of time so it could cool... okay we thought... good suggestion.  So we thought it odd when our food came before the kids.  He brought it out and said ""I told them to put the kids in first"" then shrugged it off and walked away.  My husband bit into the mac and cheese... ICE COLD.  We called the waiter over and told him.  He offered to get us a new one.  Then comes back with the same dish, steaming hot and liquid about 30 seconds later.  When asked if it was microwaved, he shrugged and said ""yeah.. that's what we do"", then took the bowl away and brought back french fries (weird), with no further conversation.  My husband bit into his chicken sandwich and I knew we had another issue. The bread was rock hard stale. He pulled the top layer off and it was flaking in chunks inside.  Pretty bad.  We called the waiter over.  He didn't look surprised, just offered to get my husband another dish.  When my husband refused to try to eat anything else, the waiter said ""I'll just go get the manager for you"" and turned around and left.  After 20 minutes, he came back saying the manager was not available and that he will just take the food off the bill, brought us the bill and never came back.  What kind of manager doesn't come out to talk to dissatisfied guests?

Overall, our meal was decent.  Our adult entree and chips and dip was apart of the 2 meals for $20 deal.  We enrolled in their club (free) and collected points to redeem for free kids meal, which worked out here.   Service was good.  Our waiter was attentive to us and always checking if we needed anything else.  I liked the self service checkout that is available at each table.  You see you own itemized bill through a little screen.  If you choose to pay your bill on credit card, you can swipe and have the option to either print your receipt or have it email to you.  Once paid, the light on the screen top turns from red to green so the waiter knows you've paid.  Awesome!  All restaurant should start doing this so we don't have to flag the waiter for our check!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-east-rutherford,2.36,2.36,2.36,2.2199999999999998,2.36

This Chili's is a newer location right next to Lowe's with plenty of parking. It is situated in a strip mall near other shops. The service was fine that day as went in for dinner Friday night. We ordered the 20 dollar dinner for 2 deal that includes 2 entrees and appetizer. I ordered the mango chicken with rice while my wife ordered the chicken fajitas. We got the Guacamole with Salsa and chips as our appetizer. When you are finished you can ask for more chips and salsa.  I have read other reviews the service is is poor, but the time we had our server he was okay. I guess it depends when you go or the servers to get. He was knowledgeable on the menu and he checked in to see if we needed anything else. For dessert, we had the triple berry cake and it was delicious. They also have some big screen TV's to watch some games if you go during game times.  When we were finish they have a tablet like machine that you can pay when your done. Its a self checkout device that you scan your credit card and gives a green light when you are cleared so the servers knows that your paid your bill. I thought it was neat because you hear on the news some places, the servers take the credit cards and copies your credit card number. The machine also doubles as a device for the kids to play games with so they are not bored.

First off, we were not aware that we were to be charged $1.99 for our children to play on their game pad.  This was not even disclosed that we were going to be charged!  How dare this restaurant do this.  But, our cheery guy server made it right by removing that charge from our bill.  I'm not the type that would complain over $1.99, but this is about a matter of principles.   Second, the restaurant only had vanilla ice cream remaining tonight (sunday night), which prompted an up-sell to the premium desserts at $7.99 and upwards.  That was a cheesy operations tactic that people should be aware of! Food: It was just okay, but on the salty side as usual in all of these chain box cookie-cutter Americana restaurants.   We've had the grilled fahitas.  Nothing to write home to.  I give it a 3-star rating for food.
