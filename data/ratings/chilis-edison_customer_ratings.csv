35,John R.,"Warren, NJ",152,1133,296.0,3.0,2012-11-18,This was our first time ever Chili's experience. Service was good and the grilled shrimp tacos I had were tasty. The menu seems extensive enough to please any taste for casual dining. We got a free chips with salsa due to a Foursquare checkin and the chips were great but the salsa was very plain.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edison?start=20,2.252,2.252,2.252,2.252,2.252

My Margarita was straight up lime juice, my food did not taste good, even my water tasted weird.  I don't know what other reviewers were talking about when they said the fajitas were great, they were probably the worst fajitas I've ever had.  They tasted like the chicken came out of a microwave bag, it was accompanied by a poor selection of somewhat old looking guacamole, low-quality three cheese mix, and shredded lettuce. The chips and salsa were the only redeeming quality of my restaurant experience here. They were actually very thin, salty and crispy and the salsa had a good flavor.

44,Michelle L.,"Iselin, NJ",1,66,33.0,2.0,2014-10-20,"Sad that they don't have the bloomin onion anymore. That was such a huge hit! I miss the spicy sauce that came with it too! This place is nothing like it use to be! It decor was so cool with old antiques around the restaurant, now its just boring and plain. My mother and I had lunch here a few weeks ago. As we were being seated we noticed that all the tables had a mini ipads on them with advertisements, games, apps etc.. After we ordered we heard two girls at the table behind us say that they didn't play any games on the ipad so why are they being charged $2 dollars on their bill that says ""games"" the waitress apologized and said that she would fix the problem. Now my problem with this is that why are they charging you to play games while you wait for your food? No where does it say that if you open up a game or app that it will charge you. I think that is nonsense.Way to rip of customers $$! And I feel sorry for families that go here and have kids with them because once the kids see a cool ipad with games they won't hesitate to play and since it doesn't say that they will charge you, no one will have a clue until there bill comes. So yeah, We had ordered 2 for $20 meal and you can choose up to 3 items. When we got our food there was hardly any food on our plate...very small portions and very bland food. When we got our bill we noticed that they had charged us $2 dollars for a stupid game that we didn't even play! We didn't even touch the ipad! The waitress apologized to us and took the $ off and said that they have been having problems with this all day...well maybe if it is such a problem get rid of the stupid thing! I have a feeling that those ipads won't last. Such a stupid idea. I haven't been here in awhile and I'm okay with saying that I won't be back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edison?start=40,2.408,2.408,2.408,2.408,2.4080000000000004
39,Cassandra G.,"Avenel, NJ",8,49,30.0,5.0,2014-10-22,"Not sure why this Chilis has a bad rep. I like this chilis. I always get coupons sent to my email. I'm always down for a good deal. Although their fajitas aren't my favorite, I still love some of the other items on the menu. The mexican egg rolls are delicious! The burgers are good. And I actually really like their bar! They have some really good drinks. The tropical sunrise is so good. I like the long Island iced teas and the margaritas come in HUGE glasses unlike other restaurants who charge you the same amount and give you much less of a drink. The chips and salsa is really yummy too. The chips are nice and flakey, salty and light. I love their desserts too. Just recently I received an email that they have some new additions to their menu. I'm excited to try them. I also like the kiosk at each table. It keeps the kids entertained and you can order refills on drinks, order new drinks, play games, order dessert and even pay your bill and have them email or print your receipt right from the machine.

She made sure our bottomless chips & salsa were truly bottomless and constantly refilled. Our order was taken quickly and came in a reasonable amount of time. I ordered the shrimp tacos which were pretty lame and generally flavorless. Portion size was solid and the shrimp fajitas that someone I was with ordered were decent. In general it is a giant restaurant chain so can't expect much from it. My one huge gripe with this place were those tablets they had in the middle of the table. I get the idea - expedite ordering, payment, etc. But really they're just clunky, take up space, and Chili's has the nerve to add a ""Table Entertainment Fee."" Apparently this fee is for playing with the games but the only thing we used that tablet for was to order Dessert at the end of our meal. The tablet should prompt the user about the fee before processing the transaction. Very sneaky.

I then called back and spoke to a Manger(if that's what you want to call him) by the name of MICHAEL who for the life of me can not understand how this man passed the interview to work in the customer service industry. Not only did Michael rudely ask me why I couldnt just get out of the car, he hung up the phone on me when I asked him for the general managers name. Words such as rude and unprofessional are an understatement when describing this man. I was told some rediculas excuse that the servers can not leave the building with their bank on them..when I asked why he as the manager couldn't assist me he refused, raised his voice and spoke over me. This man is a joke and hangs up the phone on me every time I call.I still did not get the name of the general manager of this property and would like someone to call me back immediately.He needs to be reprimanded.  I have already contracted corporate with my request and will follow up daily to make sure these 2 individuals never speak to anyone with that tone ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edison?start=20,2.6,2.6,2.6,2.6280000000000006,2.6

If it wasn't only option open till midnight I would have left right then & there. The waiter (don't remember the name of the guy) was terrible. Initially, we had ask him 5-6 times for the water to be served, and when the water was served he threw the straw on the table, he just spoof the straws on the table. Later when my friend ordered a drink, he spilled that too on the table. It was like he wasn't even paying attention to anything he did, when we called him and pointed that, he said we spilled the drink while moving it on the table. It was ridiculous. We had to call him 7-8 times for any service to be requested. And finally after all the efforts in calling him again & again, he somehow took our food ordered. He messed up that too. At first he said the 3 for $10 can be altered with veggie burger instead of Chicken/Pork Fajita, so we ordered to 3 for $10 with one regular one (with fajita) and the other one with alter one (with veggie burger). In the bill he added a veggie burger separately, and two (2) 3 for $10 in the bill. Also, the 3 for $10 included 2 desserts (one for each order), he didn't served us the dessert. He said the kitchen is closed and he made changes in bill by reducing $2 off ($1 for dessert).  After all this he expects us to tip him? I had to say, TERRIBLE. This Chili's is the worse.

25,Rajeev A.,"Metuchen, NJ",0,4,,5.0,2017-05-26,We went to their location in Edison @oak tree road.  It was early dinner at around 5 pm. The server was very pleasant and service was prompt and perfect.  The prices are really a great value for your money.  I think it is the best overall in its range.  I definitely will visit again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edison?start=20,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8

11,Carissa M.,"Elmont, NY",214,27,27.0,5.0,2017-06-10,"Richa, our server was super attentive! Went here after AutoCon because we were so hungry! Ordered the guacamole and honey chicken waffles for appetizer and mango chile tilapia as my entree. Everything came out faster than I expected and the food was hot! Came in hungry and left very full and satisfied. I ended up spending less than I expected too! This was a pleasant change to how my usual experiences are at other Chili's locations where the food is mediocre paired with slow service. Will definitely come back if I'm in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edison,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005
12,Sage J.,"Woodbridge, NJ",3,34,36.0,1.0,2017-06-21,"I haven't been to a chili's in years up until a few days ago, my in laws & I had an interesting night.  We got there at 7:20pm, our server was very sweet, places isn't busy, place appears clean, so far so good... We order a few min after we are seated.....fast forward to 8:35 when we ask the server for another water & she appears surprised & says ""Oh! The kitchen lost your ticket, I'll have to take your orders again. I'm so sorry.""  So we re-order, not the servers fault.  Soon after we get our food, a medium rare burger is well done & glasses are dirty  We ask to see a manager, he comes by, has no idea that our ticket was lost, he apologizes offers us desert, we are like sure since we were going to get desert anyway. We explain our server is very nice, but the kitchen lost our ticket etc All is okay, until I guess the manager said something to the server & then a group of servers are behind us, staring us down & talking about us right there.  We left right after. Ugh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edison,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005
20,Derek D.,"Colonia, Woodbridge Township, NJ",0,4,,5.0,2017-08-06,This is probably the best chilis I have been to. Love the staff and food is alright too. I walked in on a Saturday night 20 mins before closing to grab some bites and drinks. Our server was cleaning and ready to close but still she took good care of us. She didn't rushed us at all. Great job chilis!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edison?start=20,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006
7,Patti K.,"Metuchen, NJ",1,8,2.0,1.0,2017-09-15,"Horrible.   I used to come here a lot to watch baseball, hockey and football.  Loved the staff.   I went tonight and walked right out.   It was filthy.  The floor was sticky and the only four open tables in the bar area were not cleared from the previous customers.   This store lost a customer.  I'll try another Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edison,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006
1,Tiffany M.,"East Brunswick, NJ",248,121,232.0,4.0,2017-09-19,"Hey Hey my fun Adventurers!  Dropped by here Monday for a very early lunch---literally the first ones as soon as they opened their doors. Yes my friends and I are weirdos like that.  The bartender was nice enough to seat us, while two other servers doted on us. My friend ordered a chicken dish over a bed of rice and black beans that looked scrumptious. FYI: her plate was clean in the end. I believe I ordered the spicy santa fe salad, with grilled chicken. In was filling and the chicken wasn't dry. The dressing was really tasty along with the avocado. I don't normally order salads but this may be something I'll end up ordering this the next time I go. Overall awesome experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edison,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006
0,Stephen W.,"Edison, NJ",100,107,22.0,3.0,2017-10-03,"I've been to this Chili's a few times, usually because my mom wants to get the tacos here. I'm on the fence about this place because I'm not sure it really knows what it wants to be and that's a big problem. The atmosphere is kind of reminiscent of a casual family place with food like burgers and tacos and the like. The problem is that there are TV's with sports on. Great so it's a sports bar? Not quite. There aren't enough TV's in the restaurant for everyone to see, so if you want to watch your team you have to sit at the bar. The menu is kind of odd too. They have burgers and fries for people who want that, but they also have tacos and fajitas. So maybe it's about bar food but if you want things like that you can go to Buffalo Wild Wings. The prices aren't that bad and for that reason it's not a bad place to go if you want to have a nice meal with the family. On the other hand, there are better places to go for all aspects of the dining experience. For that reason, I'm really on the fence about what to give this place. I may be back, but it probably won't be my first choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-edison,3.2,3.2,3.2,,3.2000000000000006
