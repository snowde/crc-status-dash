28,Calista F.,"El Centro, CA",150,107,2.0,4.0,2012-01-26,"Since Chili's is a chain restaurant, you pretty much always know what to expect, food-wise. What is unexpected, especially here in El Centro, is the service. The hostess is on point every time we come to this location, the servers are friendly, the bartenders are quick, and the orders are accurate.  Not a ton of dining choices in the Valley, but this is one of the best. Applebee's will ignore you and at Famoue Dave's, they may forget you for a little while, but we've never had a single problem at Chili's. They seem to have a staff that genuinely cares.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-el-centro?start=20,3.056,3.056,3.056,3.056,3.0560000000000005

My drink always gets refilled without asking food comes out nice and hot in a timely manner and I am always greeted with a smile. You can also get the 2 for 20$ deal and get an appetizer and two entrees which in my opinion is a sweet deal for anyone.

34,Alitza M.,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",2,4,2.0,1.0,2014-02-10,"By far the WORST service I've ever gotten!!! Came down from Los Angeles to visit my grandma and decided to take her out to dinner since I'm never down here. Got to say it took about 5 mins to get seated when the place was dead!!! Our drinks took foreveeeer to get to our table!!!!!! To top it off our servant came only once after she gave us our food. I literally had to ask another random servant for a refill because not one single servant came by to see if we were ok. I felt like we were invisible. For the cherry on top, I asked one of the employees if he was the manager (I believe his name was Jose Gonzales) and as he said ""yes"" I told him about the horrible service we had received and all he had to say was ""oh ok"" I mean hello!!! Is this what you call management. Seriously I've never ever ever EVER experienced this kind of situation but I will seriously NEVER eat here again or bring my family from Los Angeles. I don't know how people here in the valley are satisfied with this kind of service and who hires this management team??? A team leader always wants to be on top and your own employees are your image. If you want a company to succeed in a lonely town and have customers from the outside to keep coming back again get NEW MANAGEMENT and employees that actually know how to work and enjoy seeing new faces!!! Worst Chili's service ever I think I'll stick to going to the ones in the big city....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-el-centro?start=20,2.7880000000000003,2.7880000000000003,2.7880000000000003,2.7880000000000003,2.7880000000000003

18,Jennifer V.,"San Diego, CA",126,152,152.0,2.0,2015-02-06,"The service was a complete disappointment. It took way too long to get our appetizer (chips, salsa, and queso). At least this part of the meal tasted good and was on happy hour, dining in the bar.  My boyfriend and I ordered lunch combos. I got the Grilled Chicken Fajitas and he got the Bacon Ranch Chicken Quesadillas. We got to pick a side so we each got salads. The salads were okay, but I found multiple brown pieces that I had to pick out. My boyfriend said his meal was alright, but mine tasted slightly burnt. It didn't look burnt, just tasted that way (could have something to do with the grill, but I have no idea). The person that brought out the food (not our waitress) forgot to bring the tortillas...and silverware....and plates. Pretty sure our waitress should have been accountable for at least the silverware, but she was nowhere to be found. So, I asked the person who brought the food out for a side of regular sour cream instead of the lime sour cream, but she brought out more lime sour cream. I gave up. I even said to my boyfriend when she walked away to get the sour cream, ""I bet she'll bring more lime sour cream"" as I noticed she wasn't really listening to me. The waitresses were socializing and not really paying attention to us most of the time. I needed a box and kept trying to get their attention but they kept talking. We really wanted to get home as we had two more hours on the road (we had just come from Arizona). When I was packing up my food, I noticed that one of my tortillas was a little green on one part. I really think it was just from a lime or something but it was just another frustration to deal with. At least our bill was under $20.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-el-centro,,,,,
15,Mylei W.,"Murrieta, CA",35,6,,1.0,2015-04-24,"This place is dirty! My boyfriend and I were traveling through el centro, and decided to stop to get some dinner. We were greeted, seated and informed on the new kiosk thingy they have on the tables! Our waitress came and we ordered our drinks, looked through the menu, and ordered a few minutes later when we were ready. Got our side salads with hardly any dressing to drizzle! My boyfriend finished his drink and never once got asked if he wanted a refill until he had already started on his entree. The waitress brings his food out, and says she will be right back with mine. Well 10 minutes later I get mine. Okay. I asked for no avocado on my entree. I ordered a chicken soft taco and a beef tostada. No big deal: why was there bacon on my plate?? Not that I don't like bacon because I do....BUT really?! There was avocado all over the bottom of my tortilla. But that's not all, I had someone else's hair stuck to my plate. Completely lost my appetite by now. The waitress walks by dis concerned a few times. Finally she stops after her fourth pass and we tell her. She seems displeased. Tells the manager...walks over....asks if I want another meal!! Umm no! I would rather not take the chance of eating more hair thanks :) didn't seem to happy. He took our plates and came back with a check saying the meal was on him tonight.  All in all, the service sucks on Friday nights and hopefully you don't have any mishaps with your meal because the management doesn't seem to be bothered by your misfortune!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-el-centro,,,,,

Karla, my server/bartender was kind, attentive, and gave some of the best service ever.  I love the crispy chicken tacos, which are no longer on the menu. When I asked her about them, she went out of her way to ask the cook if he could make them... And they did! Not only did she check back to make sure everything was ok, she was so friendly!  It's hard to find good service these days, especially somewhere like Chili's. Karla deserves to be recognized for her awesome attitude and people skills.

26,Marissa M.,"El Centro, CA",0,11,4.0,4.0,2015-06-08,"I've come here more times than I can count.  The food is consistently delicious.  The salmon is superb and so are their fresca bowls.  I've frequently gotten their 2 for $20.  The steak is good and cooked properly to your liking.  The chicken crispers are good, as well.  Recently I ordered the Grilled Chicken Salad.  I wish there was more of a description of items on their menu.  The salad had pico de gallo and it was extremely spicy. Thankfully the waitress got me a new order sans pico.  Perhaps ask for it on the side if you're not a fan of spicy! Also, in my opinion, the fajitas are not all that great.  The beef fajitas were weirdly chewy but I know some people who are big fans of them.  For an appetizer, the Texas cheese fries are overrated, I recommend going with the chips with guacamole and salsa.  They have a good couple of desserts, like their famous molten lava cakes a la mode.   The wait staff is present but ever since Chili's installed the ziosk tableside paystand, their waiters/waitresses have been less attentive. It does offer some fun games on it and allows for card-swipping to pay.  Though, I personally dislike the ziosk thing.  It is just an excuse to offer less attention to customers.  I feel like I'm inconveniencing waiters when I have to ask for something that cannot be done on the ziosk machine.  On another note, what I highly recommend doing is signing up for Chili's email list.  They constantly send out coupons for a free appetizer, free dessert, or free kids' meal.  Occassionally even a BOGO1/2 off entree coupon.  They also recently established a reward's program, which you can also sign up for on their website.  No, I am not being paid to say this, I'm just very familiar with Chili's.  There's no reason to go without a coupon! You can also access these things through their mobile app.  If you frequent Chili's, then go sign up!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-el-centro?start=20,,,,,

14,Jesse N.,"Calexico, CA",6,11,,2.0,2015-07-29,"My parents really like this place, we used too go all the time. It's always fun to see a place serve everything from a bag or microwave and call it high-end! This place is fun for a flash in the pan experience, until you see the bill. But it works and people like going to Chili's. The burgers are good and I would recommend the fajitas as the freshest thing around besides the salads. The two for twenty is your best bet. The drinks are a little pricey, and the bartenders do not know what they are doing, an Orangutan could figure it out better. They don't even bother to fill up the glasses to the right level, hey it's not their 12 bucks! Karla was our server and she was very rude, I don't know how these people keep their jobs when they're rude and focused on their phones and personal conversations. Our cups and dishes were dirty and we had to keep sending them back, and our food was cold. They really could use a Chef back there as a manager who can run this thing right. The place really isn't the cleanest either, I'd hate to due an inspection on the kitchen, I bet I could find all kinds of problems. They must be focusing on the wrong things in El Centro, when I go out to eat I like to deal with people, not machines, I can eat in front of the computer at home if I want. I would call it laziness, our waitress was lazy and nonchalant and kept forcing this ziosk on us. How impersonal can you get, then you expect a tip...get real! This is another perfect example of small town mentality where it's more about who you know then what you know. You must have to drink the punch or something to fit in, because management doesn't care. The food is mediocre at best and the ice cream was like warm foam. Did the freezer break? WTF? How can you serve this madness? The flavor and texture was horrible...YUK! You can tell that there is no Chef on premises or else there would be quality control. My advice is to do yourself a favor and stay home unless you go for the two-for-twenty deal, or else you'll probably have some buyer remorse tomorrow!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-el-centro,,,,,

They now offer flat bread (all the rage all over it seems), which was well prepared. I had the chicken avocado sandwich which was well prepared and served hot. The flavor is about what you expect- I cannot give it a 4th star because I am not a fan of this style of food and given a choice, I would not eat there. It was a place of convenience only.
