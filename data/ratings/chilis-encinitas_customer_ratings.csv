We all ordered lunch combos  that include your choice of soup or salad and your entree. Three of us ordered soup and the other two ordered salad. The soups were brought to the table and ranch dressing was also delivered. We waited and waited, until I flagged down our server and asked about our salads. I guess he forgot. So he brings out one salad when we ordered 2. He goes back and gets mine. Before I could take 2 bits, he is back with our entrees. I have to set my entree on a empty table next to us because there is no room at our table. I ask him to take it back because it will be cold by the time I finish my salad. He tells me he will keep it under the hot lamp. Wrong statement. I have been a GM in the restaurant industry for years and that's the last thing you tell a guest.

She had our table cleaned and our food packed up to go home in minutes without blinking an eye. It was such an embarrassing moment but she was cool and calm and made our exit very easy (especially on Mother's Day). She also gave us coupons for our next visit.

101,Scot S.,"Escondido, CA",103,23,22.0,1.0,2013-08-08,"I really like Chili's, we have one in Escondido which my wife and I visit regularly. When I visited this Chili's in Encinitas on the way home from a pregnancy class at the hospital, I learned quickly that not all Chili's are created equal. Here are the problems I had with this location. When we arrived, it was not busy. It was a Wednesday night around 9:30pm. We stood at the front area for a little over 5 minutes before anyone noticed us. There was no hostess at the door to welcome us and no other patrons waiting in front of us. After looking around for a bit looking for someone to seat us, a waitress finally saw us and sat us down next to a table of high school kids, ugh. My wife is 7 1/2 months pregnant at this time and there were a ton of tables, why one right next to a bunch of loud kids... One of the kids stole one of the other kids shoe and left the shoe sitting in our bench seat. My wife grabbed it and returned it to him... seems like some the waitress or hostess could have handled, but oh well. The kids had a friend working there that ended up being our waitress, she was over there chatting a bunch with them, but still did a good job of checking up on her tables. The one plus of the evening.  We ordered the pretzels for an appetizers, they came out a little burnt and we were never given silverware sets. I had to track down our waitress to get us some silverware.  I ordered a tap beer, it came with a piece of a tortilla chip in it. I ordered a Southwestern Chicken Pizza for my entree, I get it at my local Chili's often and it's delicious. My pizza came out on time with my wife's food, but our waitress accidentally dropped the entire pizza face down on the ground when serving it to me. Ugh. By the time the new one was made, my wife was finished with her meal. Even worse, when the new one came, it was under cooked. The dough was raw and in some places there were parts of the pizza where the cheese wasn't even melted! My frozen pizza's at home have never even had a problem with not melting the cheese... I told the waitress about it and she offered to make me a new one, but it was already getting way too late, my wife already finished her meal and was waiting on me and we were both getting tired. I was hoping she would comp it, but I got charged the full amount for the pizza.  We caught a glimpse of the Manager, seemed very laid back, did not care what the staff was doing. I think a lot of these issues trace back to bad management.  In summary, not all Chili's are created equal. Avoid this one if you can, we have no plans on ever returning to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encinitas?start=60,2.72,2.72,2.72,1.7640000000000002,2.72

EDIT:  11/12/13: The hubby wrote to customer service at Chili's.  They told us that they don't own this Chili's, it's a franchise.  I'm guessing that how their brand is projected to the market doesn't really matter, if they're hiding behind the ""franchise"" statement.  They don't get it.  Too bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encinitas?start=40,2.56,2.56,2.56,1.956,2.56

I've always been a fan, as they typically deliver for a corporate chain.  Well, no more.  It's been years since I walked away pleased with the experience on every level. Last week was no different.  We were greeted by the very friendly manager which was a plus, but it was down hill from there.  I will say my entree (the chicken mango dish on the healthy menu) was pretty good.  The boneless wings were dreadful. The issues were primarily with the service.  Very slow for one, then when the food was finally deliver, half the table got their entrees nearly 10 minutes before the others, though they were ""coming right out"".     NEVER in all my years of eating in restaurants and being a food server have I ordered iced tea and received a mug of room temp tea minus the ice, lemon, straw.  I HAD TO ASK for these things.  For some reason this was the most unacceptable thing of all.   BTW it was dead when we were there for lunch so there was NO reason for service to be lacking.  Such a disappointment.  At least they have the new electronic gadgets on the tables now so you don't have to wait for the bill to be delivered.  I would say from now on I'll just go to Island's but they are just as bad, at least in Encinitas.

90,K.so.vera A.,"San Marcos, CA",9,85,2.0,2.0,2014-09-24,"I was a little annoyed with my service last night at the bar. It started when I asked Tamera if she could make a margarita without sweet and sour but with fresh lime juice. She polity said she can but it will be very limey. I took a second to think, leaning toward just having a beer. She had said something about if you are looking for a ""skinny margarita I got it"" and walked away. Ok. She made a margarita. I watched her do it...everything looked ok, until she put something I didn't recognize in it. I asked ""what was the last thing""...it was sweet and sour. Now, firstly I am not on a diet, I didn't want a skinny margarita. I actually am VERY allergic to artificial sweetener. In my experience any ""mix"" has some sort of sweetener. She had said it has Agave. I had no way of knowing if their ""agave"" was true pure agave or agave essence or what. So I politely took the drink, and took a sip. It wasn't good taste wise. It was very limey. I asked for some OJ. That made it tolerable. But I couldn't get the idea that there might be something that will make me sick in it...so I gave it to my husband and asked for a beer.  She said she would take it, but I said its ok he will drink it. This is where I could see her getting annoyed. I don't know what else I could have done to be MORE polite about rejecting the drink.  After that the service just went down hill. We ordered food and that came out fine but she didn't want anything else to do with us. I had to flag her down for a side of ranch. She didn't clear our plates or bring the bill until we put our card on the bar. At which time she took it to her register without a word. Brought it back and asked if we needed a box, I said yes. She ran a box by and didn't say anything. No, thank you for coming in. No, have a great night. Nothing. Threw the box in my direction and walked away. At that point I was annoyed and said ""Thanks a lot!!"" I don't know how someone just assumes that because I ask for a drink without mix that I am on a diet. I mean I ate a pizza, texas fries, and burger bites lol. And then to ask for a drink, very clearly ""without mix"" but to go ahead an put some in there anyway?? and then give me attitude when I ask for something else. Ps. I make margaritas all the time without mix and they are amazing...not sure why it was so hard for a bartender to make one. Ya know, to top it off the bartender charged us for the drink. Now I know my husband drank it...but I have worked at many restaurants. In fact worked at a chilis the entire time I was in college...and when a customer doesn't like something, its polite to take it off the bill. Even if they drink it. While that was the least offensive part of the night it was a funny little cherry on top.  Can't say I'll be back to this location. The food was great though...always is.

Then we decided to order some deserts so we asked for a candle and a cake the waiter said he gets a birthday scoop but we had already decided on the cake, they brought the cake but still not a candle so at least we could sing him happy birthday.

But the company has become stingy and things aren't the same anymore. Happy Hour doesn't offer anything like it did before and the prices for regular meals just keeps getting higher while portions are smaller. What really got me was when I went in for the unlimited enchiladas and was told by the waitress that I could take the enchiladas home if I didn't finish and then right after I paid she comes and tells me that her manager said I can't take it anymore. If she told me upfront in the beginning it wouldn't be a surprise but she didn't tell me nor did the menu state that I couldn't take it either. The only reason I am upset by it is because it had to go to waste. Not sure if they ended up throwing it away but if an employee states that you can take it, u should honor it and not wait till after I pay to tell me I can't take it anymore. At the end of the day, it wasn't a big deal, just wasteful, I'll probably still end up coming back because there isn't a lot of choices you have for restaurants in the neighborhood :/",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encinitas?start=20,2.6,2.6,2.6,2.444,2.6

5,Caleb T.,"Encinitas, CA",90,396,826.0,2.0,2016-05-08,"So, apparently I have another Chili's also in my queue.  So, what I should say about one, undoubtedly applies to the other.  And with an identical menu and setup, it deserves an identical review.  With that in mind... /sigh Alright, I typically lump Chili's in with all the other places in the chain restaurant category. If you've been to one Island's (the Denny's of tacky burgers), you've been to them all. If you've eaten at one Marie Calendar's (the Denny's of fake home cooking), you eaten at them all. If you've subjected to yourself to one Rimel's (the Denny's of Denny's), you're probably lying in the ICU at the hospital with an inflamed bowel ravaged by dysentery. Well, Chili's is the Tex-Mex version of Denny's, not quite Mex enough to be an El Torito and not quite Tex enough to violate minority rights. Harmless enough, any appetizers you find are likely pre-frozen and fried up, salads will come out of a mixed bag, and most of the spice will come from salt. That's not to say the food is bad, it's just basic and unimaginative. A lot of cheese, some bacon sprinkled on top, a side of fries, and some cream based dressing can make anything edible for a night. And they serve beer, which is how they stay afloat along with happy hour, I'm sure. The employees are generally nice, though absent most of the time. I think this stems from from the fact that there are mini-computers on each table that can take orders instead of a waiter of waitress that you have to pay. We've had trips here where we see someone to make our initial order, someone else deliver, and then never see another soul unless we ask for a refill or the bill on that touch screen. That's extremely lazy (or cheap) on Chili's part and a bit of a disservice to their customers. Still, as far as chain places go, it's generally more alright than disgusting. There's nothing on the menu that you have to come back and try again, but there's rarely anything you won't push away either. Again, coated with cheese and served with blue cheese, you'll probably not complain too much. And if you stick with happy hour and maybe a dessert, you'll more than likely walk out with a smile and a light stomach ache.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encinitas,2.4,2.4,2.4,2.3120000000000003,2.4

But for really tasty food, fast service, and fun environment, I would pick Chili's over some other chain restaurants in this category. They have always had that ""pick two"" deal that allowed you to pick two entrees and an appetizer to share, which was always a great way to go for date night! Most recently when I went this deal was not available. However, they are having a bbq ribs deal going on right now that is pretty amazing for the price. For $10.99 you get a half rack of babyback ribs, a side salad, fries, and a small chocolate molten cake with icecream. YEAH, crazy right?! And for $6 more, you can make the half rack to a full rack. This was a lot of food and easily could be shared between two people. And for that price? PLUS dessert?! I was just so amazed. So if you're a bbq rib person, I would suggest you rush into Chili's soon before the deal is over. We also got the tableside-made guacamole for appetizer. Now living in Southern California, there are plenty of places that we could've fulfilled our guac cravings. But Chili's actually came through! You can pick what you want put in the guac and they mash the avocados right there in front of you.

We finally ordered food, then the server came back and told my husband that one of the menu options was no longer available. Ok. So he picked another and asked for the sides available and made it work. Then she came back and said they had no ceasar salads (something I assume she should have known right off the bat), so he switch to Italian house. When our salads came out, his was served with a side of oil and a side of vinegar. Okay, I get those are the main components of Italian dressing but again, I telling him it wasn't an option (and providing the actual options) would have been the correct service.  When our food came out, it looked off. I had ribs and a side of skillet mashed potatoes because that's what my server told me came with it. The ribs looked lonely all by them self on the plate.

36,A S.,"Oceanside, CA",1,11,8.0,1.0,2016-08-29,"Extremely underwhelming at this location. I find myself at a loss for words as I am utterly disappointed on almost every aspect of this restaurant. I work in food service so it doesn't take much to blow my socks off and want to give my waiter a large tip - I just want attentive service, friendly personalities, and good food. That isn't much to ask for. Well unfortunately, Chili's was 0/3. My server looked like they did not want to be there and did not want to work. My beer was empty for some time before I was offered another one, which I declined because it took forever. My daughters drink was empty for some time too, however, I decided to just find the water pitcher and fill it up myself.  The chips were great as always, it's hard to mess those up. My meal was horrible. I definitely got the bottom of the barrel of whatever I ordered and it was repulsive. Perhaps I'm being overly critical of my experience but there seemed to be a lack of any type of motivation here.  Chili's... hire people who actually want to work. It's unfortunate that you have a two and a half star overall rating.... listen to the people! I know its common for yelpers to only chime in about negative experiences but goodness, you need an overhaul!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encinitas?start=20,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8

Also the emails reminding you of low price margaritas work well in terms of convincing us to visit after work. Their 2 for $22 deals are the value choice here with the 2 salads or Texas cheese fries being their best options for the appetizer. For entrees, the steak and chicken fajitas are our favorites. The on tap beers are also good with Ballast Points Sculpin being our favorite.

30,Linda S.,"Encinitas, CA",0,14,,1.0,2017-05-18,"We've gone here for years and always had an ok experience until today.  The waitress, Rachel, came to our table with obvious attitude.  My husband tried to joke with her and ordered a margarita and said, tell the bartender not to be ""shy"" when he pours the tequila"". She immediately bristled and said I can't say that and rolled her eyes in disgust even though he said he was kidding.  We ordered without her saying hardly a word or acknowledging she understood our order, and with a nasty look on her face.  She just kept rolling her eyes.  After she left the table my husband said quietly to me, I don't like her attitude and it's annoying to have to pay to get treated like that. He went to the bathroom and the manager, Kyle, came over and said is everything ok.  I said yes.  He became very rude and arrogant and said the waitress said your husband asked for a big pour and told her he didn't like her.  I said that didn't happen and proceeded to relate the accurate account.  He said well I'm asking you to be kind to her.  I said we were very nice and even tried to joke with her but we noticed her attitude from the moment we sat down and perhaps she should be encouraged to be friendly to the customers and he left in a huff.  When my husband returned I relayed what happened and we agreed to leave as we don't need to pay to be aggravated when there are lots of restaurants that actually have great service and food.  The manager came up to my husband and began yelling loudly in front of everyone.  My husband said you have no right to talk like that to my wife so aggressively and rudely when she had nothing to do with it.  You purposely waited until I was gone to do so.  The manager began screaming and causing a big scene as we were leaving.  My husband said we've been coming here for years but will never come back when you're here.  The manager yelled you don't have to ever come back - I don't care.  The other patrons were in shock. So if you'd like to have rude service and an out of control manager, this is your place.  Suggest you find someplace that actually wants and appreciates customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-encinitas?start=20,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
