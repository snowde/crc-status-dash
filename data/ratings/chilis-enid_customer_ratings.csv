8,Garen M.,"Oklahoma City, OK",45,609,4.0,4.0,2012-12-11,"Even though it's a chain, this Chili's always does a pretty good job for Mrs Eva and me. Their service is usually pretty good and the food is always prepared well. We enjoy going here even though we prefer the mom and pop places better.  They have a new menu that they just started using yesterday. It still has most of the old favorites but has added some steak toppings and a few other new items. I am personal friends with one of the guys who originally started Chili's in Dallas. His ownership stake is long past, but I can say that the folks who run the Chili's headquarters have done a good overall job with establishing and maintaining a decent and nice place to eat. That would be a big job to maintain quality in 1500 locations in this fickle industry. Tip-of-the-hat to Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-enid,,,,,
10,Jeff K.,"Enid, OK",8,7,,2.0,2013-06-29,Had lunch here twice in the last ten days and both times it was poor at best. I wouldn't recommend Chiles. Fries were cold had to send back. Bones in burger and the burger was way overdone. Too many other choices.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-enid,,,,,
7,Ed K.,"Tulsa, OK",49,67,58.0,1.0,2013-10-01,Took forever to get seated.  Yes they were busy but no one was cleaning tables so they couldn't seat anyone.  Ordered a Hamburger ccane screw that up right?  Well they did. Meat was precooked and re warmed.  Very dry and no flavors.  Bun did match dry and old. Very sad place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-enid,,,,,
9,Chad W.,"Edmond, OK",4,99,,1.0,2013-10-28,"Given that Chili's is a chain, the food tends to be pretty consistent. This part becomes irrelevant and places a heavier burden on service, atmosphere, and the bartender. I wouldn't spoil the story for you if I could help it, but that one star is a sign of bad things. I'll start with the decent parts of my experience. The waitress was nice enough. The food was as expected. That really sums up the positive side. Of course, I say the food was as expected for my own plate. My sister had the misfortune of a salad with her soup that was little better than iceberg lettuce. The real failure was with the bar. Chili's does the ""Presidente Margarita"" which is one of their specialties. To begin, they were out of the margarita shakers, so it was served in a large mug. This part isn't really an issue in itself, but it leads into trying a couple of sips from this mug and realizing the margarita just tasted wrong. I mentioned this to the waitress when someone who appeared to be a more senior staff member interjected and mentioned that they had ""changed sweet and sour mix"" recently. I find it rather peculiar that a change in sweet and sour mix could change a drink that is relatively consistent across the country drastically enough to make it just plain unpleasant. I shrug that off and send it back in favor of a martini. A young man who appeared to be the bartender hear and confirmed that it was a dry gin martini. What I received was a glass of olive brine. One sip was enough to make me actually recoil in disgust at what I can honestly say was the worst excuse for a martini I have ever had the displeasure of tasting. I do not know what motivated the bartender to come up with such an abomination, but clearly this Chili's has some consistency issues with food and at least one person utterly desecrating the profession of bartender. If I want Chili's, I'll stick to Edmond or OKC at this point.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-enid,,,,,
6,Christiana S.,"Dallas, TX",136,604,44.0,4.0,2014-03-10,"I am going to say outright this review is for the TAKE-OUT service ONLY.  I have not eaten in the dining room. My service was excellent.  I was welcomed with a smile by a very nice young lady.  My food was cooked, immediately, to order, and it was still hot when I got it back to the hotel (after hauling luggage in, checking in, getting ice, changing to PJ's...).  That is something!   I did wander into the bar and dining room as I needed to use the restroom (other side of the building).  It looked INSANE.  I guess this is one of the few ""family-friendly"" places in Enid, so it was packed...on a Tuesday?  Maybe there was a game. Anyway, they were packed, and it looked rather hectic in there.  I was immensely grateful I had decided to get my food to-go. The food was just as expected, which is the entire point of chain restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-enid,,,,,
4,Montressa J.,"Towson, MD",80,6,,1.0,2015-12-07,"I would do a zero if I could!  I ordered roasted wings and broccoli to go.  I wish I would have checked the order before leaving. When u reached my destination, I was very disappointed to see half done, raw looking wings. They appeared to have come straight from the freezer,  with little to no seasoning,  and popped in the oven for 2 minutes.  The broccoli was falling apart and far from decent. WHY WOULD YOU SERVE PEOPLE DISGUISING FOOD LIKE THIS.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-enid,,,,,
5,Michelle D.,"Enid, OK",5,128,44.0,4.0,2015-12-08,"Well....we gave Chilis another  chance.   Glad we did. Hostess  was much friendlier.  We got seated right away. Waiter was super friendly  and attentive.  The new menu items are great. We had the prime rib tacos, stuffed chicken burrito and fried pickles.  All of which was great. Will go back to try some more of the new food items.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-enid,,,,,
3,Jeremiah A.,"Enid, OK",0,47,,3.0,2016-11-16,"Chili's is good except for there togo, its better than the other chain restaurants in enid. Seriously the to go needs to be redone half  the time you have to see the bartender to get your order which kind of defeats the purpose of to go if you're going to have to hang out at a bar, most of the time its clean the kitchen and kitchen staff are always outside smoking and playing grabass but thats poor leadership on the managers part",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-enid,,,,,
2,Kate M.,"Casper, WY",17,39,3.0,1.0,2016-11-23,Served cold good. Mashed potatoes with congealed gravy. Still waiting on my wine ordered 30 minutes ago. Restrooms are filthy.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-enid,,,,,
0,Alora Y.,"Malibu, CA",222,88,32.0,4.0,2017-06-26,"Chili's is one of those places that never fails  to give you what you're looking for. The Enid location has been a go-to for me and my family for a long time now. The service is prompt and friendly. We came on a crowded Sunday afternoon during the church crowd and only had to wait around 10 minutes for a table. The menu has a wide variety. At our table alone we had a flatbread pizza, a burger, a salad, a half rack of ribs, and fajitas. As you can see, you can pretty much satisfy any craving at Chilis. The chips and salsa appetizer are a must. The chips are made there in the restaurant and are so fresh and crispy. The salsa is not very spicy but has a wonderful flavor so a wide range of palettes can enjoy it. At each table there is a small electronic device that allows you to pay at the table whenever it is convenient for you. You can also split the checks by item using it which makes it very easy for big groups as well as the servers! You can't go wrong with Chili's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-enid,,,,,
1,Samantha S.,"Minneapolis, MN",202,207,383.0,3.0,2017-06-26,"I would say this is a pretty standard Chili's. We came in on a Sunday afternoon, so it was a bit busy. We had a 10min wait and then we were seated. Our waitress was very friendly and brought out our meals exactly as we ordered. It was easy to pay the bill as there is a little device on the table that allows you to swipe your card (and even split the check).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-enid,,,,,
