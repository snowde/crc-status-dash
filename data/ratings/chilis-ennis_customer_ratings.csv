11,Renee C.,"Dallas, TX",787,187,276.0,4.0,2012-06-16,"Can't really critique too much on the food here, since everyone has at least been to a Chili's. You already know what to expect as far as taste goes. I was just passing by here on a road trip and I have sensed the neighborhood feel because it's in a small town - exactly what Kristie A. is saying in her review. I know that almost everyone knew each other...except for me and my party lol. I like how you can order a very affordable meal, and create 2-3 meals out of it because portions are ginormous! I always get a to-go box after eating at Chili's. The server was very friendly, bubbly, and took good care of us. Can't really describe anything any further about this place without sounding redundant because it's a Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ennis,,,,,
18,Anna W.,"Beaumont, TX",2,13,2.0,1.0,2013-03-17,"The restaurant was not clean. We arrived within 30 mins of them opening, no time for everyday stuff to be an issue yet. The bar next to us dividing the booths was covered in dust, some booth seats still had food on them and the bathroom was gross. This restaurant really should have been cleaned the night before or before opening that morning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ennis,,,,,
16,John N.,"Houston, TX",2,12,,1.0,2013-06-23,"This location, like almost all Chili's is run down. The service is ridiculously slow, and the crowd seems mostly local even though it is in the middle of nowhere. Where do these people live? All could be saved if the food was good. It's not, and Brinker must be rolling over in his grave.  I don't know why I even tried it!?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ennis,,,,,
14,John K.,"Ennis, TX",68,15,3.0,3.0,2014-04-02,I gave Chili's another chance with a to go order on Sunday and the food was great. It was ready when I got there and the waiter was fast at getting me checked out. The manager even stopped by. A great improvement from my last visit.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ennis,,,,,
12,Ronnie W.,"Fairfield, TX",10,4,,3.0,2014-08-06,Pretty much like always for this chain. Good food but nothing to write home about. For the price the 2 for $20 is a pretty good deal. I got the chicken fajitas and was really pleased to find that they actually give a good amount of bell peppers with them. It seems places are cutting way back on that.  They did make a couple mistakes on my order but it wasn't a huge deal. Ordered corn tortillas and got flour. Could have got them changed but didn't worry about it. Also ordered the beans and rice which are $1 extra. That is kinda standard for fajitas so paying an extra buck gets the nerves a bit. Anyway they forgot those. I didn't really care but they took it off the bill with no issues.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ennis,,,,,
10,Mo M.,"Dallas, TX",3,41,2.0,1.0,2014-10-04,"*I haven't been since I found a roach in my margarita glass :( I really love that Tex mex salad too  Food is always fine- service is typically OK. Sometimes food comes out all crazy. That's cool... But for the love of god, check on your TOGO orders!! 8 people past without any acknowledgement. Including manager. It sat ready forever. I'm annoyed.  *since cotton patch has opened, I've seen more staffing and more acknowledgment at the Togo. The kids are cool and probably love there little chili's family until Brittney steals Leah's bartending boyfriend Ryan... Getting off track here.  Point is: They are getting better and its still the best margarita in town. .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ennis,,,,,
13,Shaun K.,"Overland Park, KS",0,26,,5.0,2015-07-28,"One of the better Chillis Ive been to.  You can tell the staff is well trained and well managed.  From the hostess, waitress to the cooks, all was good.  I'll come back for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ennis,,,,,
6,Alexis B.,"Nashville, TN",688,1652,2514.0,2.0,2015-11-29,"Service was good, but the food is just so bad. Among the worst fish tacos I've ever had. The fried cheese curd appetizer was pretty good though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ennis,,,,,
7,John H.,"Corsicana, TX",3,33,28.0,1.0,2016-04-02,4 dirty tabes..  35 min wait for drinks..  There not even busy..   Hope food is better than the services..,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ennis,,,,,
8,Gayle J.,"Garland, TX",11,21,2.0,1.0,2016-05-25,"Horrible service. Two people sat AFTER us got their food. Then, onion rings cold. But, the icing on the cake....two 57 year old people had to show the staff how the AMEX point system works on their Ziosk system. Corporate needs to train their people better. Also, a hostess that stands around, looking out the window and doesn't bus tables is useless. No wonder food is cold. No team effort.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ennis,,,,,
5,Ashley N.,"Midway, TX",76,2,,5.0,2016-07-31,Great from the beginning...greeted by the hostess holding the door and not just for me... A 29 year old very capable of getting the door but also for the rest of my party of 4 who slowly came in 1 by 1. We were then promptly seated and our waiter came over immediately and took great care of us!!! Didn't write a thing down and every thing we ordered all with specific directions (no this add that change this) came out piping hot and everyone was satisfied!!! Everyone was full 3/4 through their meal but the food was so good we wanted to finish. I personally tried something I've never had and I LOVED it!!! The chicken enchilada soup  To top it off someone picked up our whole check but you guys may not get that blessing but the good food was a blessing in itself!!! Bon Apetite!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ennis,,,,,
2,Mike J.,"Houston, TX",0,5,,1.0,2017-02-26,"Stopped in enroute from Dallas to Houston today Sunday Feb 26, 2017. While they were very busy there were 2 6 tops open that we could see. No one else behind us waiting. The greeter approached us and ask if we wanted open seating at the bar. I stated ""at the bar?""  Her reply was well we don't have any tables for you. We promptly left and will never stop here again. I travel this route both ways at least 10 times a month",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ennis,,,,,
4,Steve S.,"Justin, TX",5,22,1.0,2.0,2017-04-08,Good food. Chicken enchiladas were good. Service is terrible. Extremely slow. May not have enough staff. Finally got a refill on my water after i finished eating.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ennis,,,,,
3,Troy C.,"Conroe, TX",0,124,206.0,3.0,2017-05-10,The food isn't all that bad but it is most certainly not that good. I think some of the waitstaff are way too casual and appear to not care. Not everybody just a few,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ennis,,,,,
1,Trevor W.,"Ennis, TX",0,2,1.0,1.0,2017-08-17,"Took forever for food, staff was extremely rude, and the order was wrong. Very disappointed in this location since most locations are good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ennis,,,,,
0,Molly B.,"TX, TX",42,7,2.0,3.0,2017-10-13,This chili's that is located in Innis Texas is in my hometown. We don't have many choices for variety of food but we go to Chili's quite often because of the variety. The service here is usually pretty slow but today around 4 o'clock it was really fast and our waitress was really good we had the ribeye steaks medium rare with mashed potatoes and broccoli and all were delicious. I had a jalapeño margarita and it was very good. We got chips and salsa which we almost always do because I love having the chips are in my son loves the salsa because it's not too hot for him.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ennis,,,,,
