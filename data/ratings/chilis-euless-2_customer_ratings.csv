29,Kinz M.,"Austin, TX",1075,339,122.0,3.0,2012-04-04,"Oh, ya know. It's Chili's. They're inconsistent most of the time, but generally not a bad choice. The people are usually nice and the management at this location is all right. The waiters/waitresses are typically high schoolers or early college kids, so I cut them a break. They don't know how to have great customer service yet. AND they can afford to get paid 2.15 + tips... or whatever the going rate for servers is. The food is decent. Burgers are ok, but seriously... just ok. Not spectacular. Don't mis-read this, because there are TONS of better burgers out there. I mean, if you're going to Chili's, just don't get a burger. Get nacho's or something. Those are usually a good bite. So, if you've got nothing better to do, go to Chili's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-euless-2?start=20,2.476,2.476,2.476,2.476,2.476
35,Moto S.,"Fort Worth, TX",14,340,94.0,3.0,2012-10-19,"Okay, I'll admit it, I occasionally go to Chili's, don't like it? Lump it. This one has been around a few years, and usually service is good, but it, like others, can be hit and miss, depends on your servers mental capacity and work ethics, I think. Okay, first thing is this, if Chili's didn't serve the salsa and chips that they have been for years, I doubt I'd be going in very often, if at all. While the other stuff on the menu is decent to pretty good mostly, it's usually filled with stuff I go somewhere else to get, that makes that item better. Not hatin', just sayin'. Yep, I go in, get the salsa and chips as my main concern, then fill in around it. Usually a sandwich of sorts, or maybe the app combo, or an occasional burger. I like the onion strings, but they're usually a little greasy, but then most onion strings are I guess. Basically, I LIKE THE SALSA AND CHIPS, and everyone else I know who goes to Chili's IS THE SAME WAY! Maybe they should find a way to capitalize on this more? I dunno. But I will still find myself in a Chili's from time to time with a big bowl of chips and some salsa in front of me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-euless-2?start=20,2.54,2.54,2.54,2.54,2.54

40,Ashley C.,"Columbus, OH",126,186,261.0,1.0,2013-07-30,I usually like chili's. We go for the 2 for 20 deal. This location has a few issues though. A couple times we have walked in while it was slow and it took a while to be greeted and seated. The service was a little below average and slow. The food also has issues. A few months ago my husband ordered chicken. I think they were supposed to be like chicken wings. They came out cold so he send them back and they were warm but had hardy any sauce on them. This last time I got the chicken fajitas. Wow was there a ton of onions. I like onions but that was pretty much all they were. There was also a weird taste to everything. Maybe they were old. My husband got the pasta which he liked but the bread was covered in grease. He couldn't eat it. On top of that I overheard the person next to us send their food back because it tasted old as well. I think we will probably take a break from this location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-euless-2?start=20,2.34,2.34,2.34,2.34,2.34

Once we ordered in advance to save time and pick up, still ended up waiting 50 minutes, another time waited until 1:30 to go to lunch to try and miss lunch crowd and it still took about 45- 50 minutes to get our food, even though there were hardly any customers in the restaurant.

One more thing..I'm good with my masculinity, but it is always cold in the bar, im sure the ac is set for the staff, but the bar patrons (11) wearing sweatshirts, jackets...crazy.... picture to follow.

The server was great, the lady manager (light blue shirt) was nice and really trying to help, but the head manager that came over at the end was just not willing to make our experience any better so we end up paying $62 for the meal for 2 plus a tip for what should have been a $20 meal for two plus $15 in drinks. We originally ordered the sirloin, in which two of the three steaks we couldn't chew through so we ended up spitting out. The third Sirloin was so tough we couldn't put the fork through and showed the manager that fact. We were offered Rib eye and then were charged full price for that because there sirloin was not edible. And somehow this is our fault. We tried to get the manager to comp something other than the three steaks he took away, which means we got zero benefit from those steaks and forced to pay higher for the ribeye, and are part of both steaks. We didn't bother to say anything until the end that our ribeye a we undercooked (raw looking in center, overdone pale on outside). I know this isn't a steak house but come on. No wonder this place has 2.5 stars. Previously I've stuck with the California Flat Bread, and have liked that. We got dessert,....yes dessert was indigestion from our lousy food at Chili's.

26,Billy H.,"Bedford, TX",0,42,,1.0,2016-07-19,"We have been going to Chili's restaurants for many years in various locations. This was by far the worst service ever. We were two adults and two kids. We arrived around 8:00 on a Tuesday to a far less than busy place. After being seated, it was a while before a server showed up. I ordered a beer and was asked if I wanted a bottle or draft, I chose draft. After another long wait, the beverages and the chips arrived except for the beer. I was told that they didn't have that beer on draft. I said a bottle would be OK. Another wait and the bottle of beer arrived. Then the really long wait began. We finished one plate of chips and some of the beverages. Still no food. We were told our order was next up, but I saw our server deliver food to another table next. Another platter of chips was half consumed before our meals finally arrived, except for the fries for one plate. They weren't ready. At this point I asked for a manager. After a few more minutes a different server brought the fries and said the long wait was too long and he would tell the kitchen to be faster. This guy never identified himself as a manager or offered any real apology. Next time our server came by, I asked if that guy was the manager. She said yes. I pointed out to her that he was spending a very long time talking to two attractive young women at another table. I got an eye roll and the assurance that she would let the area manager know. I hate to rag on servers for kitchen and/or management problems, but our server was also less than stellar. To wrap it up, we used the table kiosk to pay. There were two bills for our table. One for our food and beverages and a second one for the draft beer which they didn't have. So, it was almost a perfect screwup. Service, food /beverage delivery and billing.

5,David S.,"Coppell, TX",2,54,,4.0,2017-01-26,This was a fast Chilis ...Really ! There is one here that I finally found This is the Best Chilis I have been to. All others are three stars or less.  Buffalo chicken salad was good. Bowls are shallow and appear to have more food than you get... Nice Trick !,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-euless-2,3.08,3.08,3.08,,3.0800000000000005

Our server came out pretty quickly and gave us our dinner ensemble.  Dinner: qeuso app             Black cherry margarita             Black cherry lemonade             Ribs             Buffalo chicken salad Everything came pretty quickly, the drinks came first. The black cherry flavour is very nicely done. I went with the dry rub. Not a bad decision, but the sauced ones are slightly better. Overall the ribs were very well done, and not tough or over done. The salad was well put together, and the wife enjoyed her salad. All in all, a very nice outing and well balanced drinks were had with good food. Keep up the good work in Euless.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-euless-2,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005
