Other than that, this place is solid.  The location is great, and (if you sign up for emails) they often send out coupons that get you free stuff with your entree purchase. The salmon is wonderful.  The burgers are great and always cooked exactly how you order.  The hot wings are HOT!  The fries are well-seasoned.  The red velvet lava cake thing is pretty good, too.  Pass on the brownie sundae, unless you have a free coupon. Like I said, service is alright (at best) and the manager there is ""interesting"".  Super polite, but ugly at the same time and not very accomodating.  My twin sister calls it ""Nice-Nasty"". Anyway, good spot to catch a bite to eat before a movie  or an afternoon of shopping! If you are dining inside, use the kisok on the table to get your check.  It's pretty neat and super efficient - especially when you are trying to grab a good seat at the theatre.

85,Tom R.,"Evanston, IL",66,75,4.0,1.0,2013-02-11,"I wouldn't say we go to Chili's a lot, but it's in the area and I could think of worse things to eat... That being said, I don't know that I'll be going back to Chili's for a while, in general after getting food poisoning after eating there this weekend.  Obviously I can't pinpoint if it was Chili's or not, but based on deductive reasoning, and the fact that I felt fine all day, ate at Chili's that night, ate nothing else afterwards, woke up at 3:30am and spent the rest of the early morning in the bathroom, I'm going to guess it was the Chili's. And honestly, I would have still given this Chili's a 2 or 3 rating, even with the food poisoning episode, but the service was absolutely terrible.  You know the service is bad when you make it a point to lower the tip down from 20% on the little touchscreen thingy at the table. I honestly don't remember the last time I've tipped less than 20% on even semi-decent service, but this was downright awful. I don't want to name any names, because that would be rude, but if you can avoid sitting in the bar, I would highly suggest it. First off, the bar was kind of crowded, so when a guy got up to leave his booth, we made sure we would be able to snag it. We had no problem with the fact that the table still had drinks and the check from the previous party on it, as we were the ones that snaked in and grabbed the booth out from under the previous party. Our waitress came by and said she'd be right over to clean up the table and take our drink orders, but after 5 full minutes of waiting, nobody had come by. The manager finally noticed that we were still sitting in filth and came over to wipe down the table. It wasn't until about 3 minutes later that our waitress came over to clean the table as well, even though it was already done.  She then took our drink orders, a diet coke and a captain and coke, and our order for chips and salsa. She came right back with the diet coke, but the captain and coke was nowhere to be found. Now I know that the alcohol orders all flow through the bar and the bartender was busy, so I'll give them that, but when I can see the bartender make my drink and set it out, I assume I'll be getting it soon.... I guess I shouldn't be so quick to make assumptions as it took probably another 10 minutes for someone to bring me that drink, AND IT WASN'T EVEN OUR WAITRESS! It was just another server who came up to get drinks for his own table, but decided to help the bartender clear out some of the drinks that were piling up there. It probably took another 20 minutes for our server to come back to take our food order.  Needless to say, as soon as she dropped the food order she got me another drink and dropped the check. We ate, paid at the touchscreen machine and left. I don't expect Chili's to have amazing service, but I also don't expect the service to be as shitty as it was. I'm surprised I even left as much of a tip as I did, but I hate being a dick when it comes to tipping so I was a bit on the generous side. It still wasn't 20% though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-evanston?start=40,3.52,3.52,3.52,2.724,3.5200000000000005

So we moved ourselves over one table, which pissed the server and manager off. I caught them both eyeballing our table and talking out of the sides of their mouth--it was clear they were talking about us. We sensed animosity from our server ever since. Then, I was given a glass of water with red flakes floating in it. I didn't say anything to our aloof server about it and ordered a Coke instead. I ate three fourths of my entree only to discover a long black hair in my food. I told our server, Brenda, about this who insincerely apologized. We understood her poor service by the reaction of the apathetic manager, who came over to our table and flatly apologized. He couldn't even maintain eye contact with us when we were talking. It was clear he lacked the necessary training. He may have been new also. I don't know if the impending holiday threw their game off, or if they were simply having a bad day, but the service was horrible, and I won't be returning. I have always had to fight with my boyfriend to eat there because he hates Chili's, and now I'm totally turned off too.

A friend of mine who mentioned a severe food allergy was given a dirty look by his server, delegitimizing his grave condition. Then, the food was vile and overpriced. Unless you are in a family or group where everybody likes very specific, very different foods, I could not understand why you would visit chilis. The tacos were gross, the hamburgers tasted like hockey pucks, and the flatbread was soggy. If you can't make any of these 3 very different foods right, why not focus on making one thing semi-edible? Our water was never refilled, and as the meal neared the 2 hour mark at this ""casual dining establishment,"" we finally received our checks.  This was where the meal hit its low point. In our party, half of the members received their checks, while the other half was told that the credit card machine had malfunctioned. Over the next 40 minutes, we were continually told that the machine was broken, without any consideration for the amount of time that it was taking to process the checks. We were not offered any water during this time, nor did we receive any type of discount or apology for their poor service.

(Thanks, friend!)    -- 15 minutes goes by (at a minimum, quite possibly more, we had to estimate based on the time stamp on a text I sent sometime after we got our drinks) -- We flag down the server who seems to be helping all the other tables in our section. Me: Excuse me, Hi, m'am. Are you our server? Server: No. (Blank stare.) Me: Um, okay. Do you know who is? Server: ... Me: Because, it has been a while and nobody has come by to take our order. Server: Oooh, yeah, I'm your server. No apologies. (As a former server, this is suuuper surprising to me.)  We try to be good sports and go ahead place our orders. We also ask for refills on the drinks that we emptied during our wait. Server completely disappears. When she returns with our food, we remind her about the drinks. Again, she disappears. Never checks on us, never brings the drinks. My husband thinks something is missing from his wimpy steak plate. He says it feels a little ""low carb"" to him, lol. We consult the menu and he is right -- the fries are missing. We'd love to let the server know, but again, she is nowhere to be found.  By this point, we're done with our food.
