I totally recommend going to Chili's for Happy Hour. Get full and buzzed on very little money! My kinda restaurant. I got a top shelf margarita (or two) and they were both great.

Our server was attentive in terms of drink refills. But those were the only good things about our experience. Our dinner took a long time to arrive.

Service is usually pretty good to the occasional excellent.   The coupons they send us work pretty well as I'm off work the same days the coupons are valid for. The latest which the wifey and I have taken advantage of is the 'free app or dessert'. It works great, we order the required entree and get a free nachos... We've used it this way several times with no troubles, except the last time. The manager explained that we needed to order 2 entrees for 2 people, whereas the coupon clearly states 'one adult entree purchase required'.  Just didn't appreciate the attitude she gave us. Then, on top of everything, the top of the receipt where there is usually the survey to fill out was totally torn off!   Sad when someone knows you're gonna blast them so they try to take away your opportunity.

My hubby and I ordered their 2 for $20 deal in which we selected baby back ribs, chicken pasta, along with chips & guacamole dip. The deal is totally worth it. My hubby was a bit iffy about the ribs but they came out to be truly amazing for the price we paid for. I would recommend going with the original house sauce for the ribs. My chicken pasta was very good. They provided ample amount of chicken on top that was juicy and not too dry; just how I like it. I was under the assumption that the meals were going to be served in smaller portions considering you're paying a lot less! But nope, they were full entree meals. I had to take a box and to-go half of my pasta home! The guacamole dip was mediocre; something that can be easily made from home. They were generous to refill our chips not once, but twice!

It's the closest one to me, but I dont mind driving the extra 7 minutes to roseville to get good customer service. I've come here a few different times & been disappointed with the attentiveness of the servers & the incredibly long time it's take to get my food even when the restaurant is relatively empty, but this most recent time was definitely the straw that broke the camels back.   It was last saturday evening, about 9pm. The restaurant was probably 1/3 full, but it took the host about 10 minutes to notice us & seat us, so that was the beginning of me becoming annoyed. Me & my boyfriend decided what we wanted before the waitress even came to get our drink order (another 10 minutes) , so we ordered it all at once & asked for chips & salsa while we waited. At that point I was really frustrated because I'd been in the restaurant for 20 minutes already & nothing to show for it. I waited another 10 minutes before my boyfriend asked me if I just wanted to leave, because we still hadn't gotten our drinks or anything, so I said ""sure, let's get out of here."" So we got up & left & the host asked very confused why we were leaving & I very simply let her know that we'd been there a half hour & didn't even have drinks yet. While we were walking to the car I saw the waitress put our drinks at the table, but no chips & salsa. We drove to Red Robin instead & they gave us our drinks immediately & a basket of fries while we waited.

I work in the restaurant industry and I realize that there is a lunch rush, and things can be hectic. However, we did not come during lunch rush hours, and there weren't many tables. We were told two servers would be helping us out, so you'd think that the service would be even better than usual right? Wrong. Our server Janelle started out by taking our drink order, which when she brought out was wrong. We ordered an appetizer, and it came out in a decent amount of time. Never came back to ask us how our food was, appetizer or entree. We sat with our glasses empty for at least 10 minutes before she even noticed us. Right after she brought our food out, she brought the check... We didn't even get a chance to take a bite out of our food! It wasn't busy so why the need to rush us?  I'm not complaining about the food by any means. But if you get assigned her as a server, I highly suggest patience being one of your personality traits.

The last time I was there, the place was pretty empty and I like that because things get done better and with a little more care. I started off with nachos and corn/guacamole which was a great start. Then I ordered the ""make it a combo"" where I could choose 2 things out of quite the selection.  I decided on shrimp and baby back ribs in BBQ sauce, mashed potatoes and broccoli for about $17.50.  I also ordered a little side of rice. My expectations weren't very high but I took a chance because it sounded good and figured that for $17.50  they would at least try to be a little impressive.  Well let me tell you, the shrimp was really good and the ribs pretty much fell off the bone and  were absolutely delicious!

I was first surprised how packed they were at lunchtime with all the kids and families. Does anybody work?! But then I realized it was spring break. Luckily we were still able to get a table with no wait and were quickly greeted by an energetic server. One thing I HATE (that Chevy's does too) is have those stupid iPad like screens at our table. They pass them off as ""helpful"" by explaining how we can order drinks from them, pay our bill and play games. Wait, didn't we go out to eat to actually spend time together? I thought so... Last thing we need is another electronic device to stare at. Please take these ridiculous things away, we will stick to the old fashioned interacting with a human server for our meal thank you. We ordered the chips and salsa as an appetizer which were good. Even with 5 of us we didn't finish the whole basket. Then our entrees came out in a reasonable amount of time.  I ordered the Vegetarian Black Bean Burger with lettuce, avocado, cheese, onion strings and some tasty sauce. I thought the burger was good, but had more rice/grain in the party than black beans. The last time I had their black bean burger was probably at least 10 years ago and it's definitely changed since then! I miss the old smashed black bean patty. The fries that came with the burger were only ok, they seemed to have been sitting under a heat lamp for too long and weren't fresh or crispy. Everyone else ordered salads which they all enjoyed. No one in our party was able to finish their meal! Not even close, we each ended up taking half home. Chili's has a very small lunch menu so we all ended up ordering regular sized dinner portions.

Have been to this restaurant many times over the last 15 years and always had the mind set of ""nothing fantastic, but good and decent food and always consistent"".  It was kind of late for us (08:30 or so) a week ago and had the kids home for a visit and it was too hot to cook...so we decided on Chili's. I like a friendly waiter as much as anyone, but our waiter was WAY over the top...stood at the table and chatted for 10 minutes like we were his new best friends..talking about video games and movies...um, can I have my iced tea please!! We actually got to the point of not talking, just waving that the food was okay (which it wasn't) There were four of us and since it was late we decided to just share the appetizer sampler plate and fajitas and chips/salsa. The chips and salsa were very, very greasy, as if the chips were soaked in cold grease too long.  Not crunchy and light as they used to be.  They were shiny with grease and soft...okay, pass on those.  Nothing on the appetizer plate was hot and none of it seemed freshly prepared.  The fajitas came (don't remember the price but close to $20 for a combo of steak, chicken and shrimp) and there was about 6 cubes of steak about an inch square that were too tough to bite through and maybe 8 small shrimp and half a dozen small strips of chicken (maybe half a breast worth).  The ""condiment"" plate had a few shot glass size metal cups with a tablespoon each of shredded cheese, pico de gallo, salsa, etc. about enough for ONE fajita.

Out of all the big American style neighborhood restaurants (Applebees, TGIF, Sizzler, Ruby Tuesday, etc.), well most that I have been to anyway, Chili's is probably the one I can tolerate most.  Although that could be changing soon.  Here's why...      Chili's is in the process of evolving their order placement system from a personal human service (wait staff) to an automated table kiosk where you can place your own order without much need of human intervention.  Applebee's is playing with this system as well, but their food sucks (DO'OH!) so we won't go that deep.  Moving along...  The reason that I have a problem with this is that these kiosks are job-killers.  These systems may not have an immediate, profound, impact toward jobs in their company, but ultimately they will.  The system is designed for efficiency and the ability to terminate existing positions which will in-turn improve the corporate Bottom Line.  But who am I to stand boldly on this train track, with my arms in the air, as the Technology train comes barreling my way, hauling a hell of a lot of inevitable ""change"" behind it?  I am one man.  One man who can change little, but avoid this train track altogether.  It's frustrating to see this kind of change, and yet most will see it as convenience.  Which, in fact, is.      Now that I have carried on much longer than I should have.  This Chili's was clean inside, and the staff was helpful and friendly.  Our waitress even smiled as she introduced us to the self-ordering system at the table as she provided instructions on how to use it (okay I am over it.  I promise!  Ha!).  I usually have ribs when I come to Chili's because frankly, I am impressed with how well they turn out.  On this date, however, I opted to do their latest promo which was Top Shelf Tacos.  You can mix and match which types of tacos you get, so that was cool.  I ordered a couple of spicy shrimp and one tilapia.  They were alright, nothing amazing but definitely ""hit the spot!""  If you're expecting spicy from the spicy shrimp tacos, you're going get mild; just a heads up.  The rice and beans that flanked them were pretty ordinary.  I will stick to ribs next time.  My brothers and my father enjoyed their meals very much, and overall we had a great experience together.      Three stars, our waitress deserves five.  She was efficient and had a great sense of humor.  There is plenty of private parking because this chili's is located in a shopping complex.  I will probably be back again because it is a good option when you are hungry but don't know exactly what you want.  Until customers are forced to use the Chili's help-yourself system anyway...  Ha!   (deep voice) Barbeque Sauce...  *ends singing*",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fair-oaks?start=40,3.04,3.04,3.04,2.8280000000000003,3.0400000000000005

Most of the time we go to the restaurant, sometimes to go.  Today was one of the times we took it to go.  My fiancé ordered the Quesadilla explosion salad. I believe one of the key components to a salad is the dressing. Somehow, the dressing was missing. Didn't realize it until took everything out of the bag at home. I ordered the Smokehouse combo. I have been ordering this the last several times, as it generally has all the good stuff. But it seems like at least the last several times, they forget about the pickles.  I don't expect places like this to be 5 michelin stars, but I would at least hope that the majority of the time, they remember all the components to the dish. I mean seriously, how do you forget dressing on a salad.  I guess this is one of the places when I go to only when I am having a craving for this restaurant, which is higher on the tier than when I am feeling lazy and just don't want to cook.
