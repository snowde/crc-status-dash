24,Joseph F.,"JACKSON HTS, NY",10,27,21.0,3.0,2012-06-04,"While not typically a fan of large, national restaurant chains, I was somewhat impressed by my outing to Chili's for a family member's birthday. Since we were a large group (about 12-13 people), it took a moment to have us seated, but not very long (5-7 mins). Waiter was friendly and attentive (and kept the nachos coming).  Flipping though the menu, you have your chain staples. Burgers, wings, salads, and combos. Playing it safe, I went with the Shiner Bock BBQ Burger, and was surprised. The burger was juicy and flavorful (and gone a few moments after it was placed in front of me). Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food as well, some where even pleasantly surprised.  Only negatives were things you'd find in any national chain. There were several other guests there for birthdays as well (apparently), so the sound of staff singing and clapping was almost constant and somewhat annoying (we did feel bad that the staff had to do something so corporately cliche and unoriginal, as a cute sing-song ""dance monkey, dance!"" kind of moment). Also don't know how good everything is on a consistent basis, we could have been there on a ""good"" night.  All in all, food was good, service was good, and we left satisfied. Best you can hope for when going to a national chain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-farmingdale?start=40,2.412,2.412,2.412,2.412,2.412

I popped in today because I had a free appetizer, and went with the southwest egg rolls, which were really good. Then my sister and I shared a triple dipper, 3 smaller apps, and those were good. We also got twofer pomegranate margaritas which hit the spot on this sweltering day. This is where things went horribly wrong. I order the same exact entree every time I come to Chili's, the crispy chicken tacos with fries. After all the appetizers today, my sister and I decided to just split one and take the rest home. So, I bit into the taco and the chicken was ice cold. I was completely turned off after that, I politely discarded the food into my napkin and sent it back. Our waitress was very accommodating which was nice. I may avoid coming here until the thought of cold chicken leaves my brain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-farmingdale?start=40,2.248,2.248,2.248,2.248,2.248

When she mentioned Chili's I was like Oh god .. the Olive Garden of ribs but actually I was surprised. Well not really considering I've heard their ribs jingle since I was 6 yrs. old, I kind of expected it to be OK and it was .. definitely not Smokin' Al's of Bay Shore but at the same time it was good for the price and was definitely sufficient for our date. My date frequents this place a lot as an affordable casual dinner spot and that's exactly what it was.

The server was pleasant but spoke so fast that I had to ask her to repeat what she said frequently. Regarding the food, the salsa was very watery tomato juice with a bit of hot sauce. The chips were paper thin with almost no taste. My lunch salad consisted of pineapple wedges which were a bit past their prime and browning, canned mandarin orange wedges, wilting greens and a dressing which also was without taste. All of it was drowned in way too much water. Should I have expected better? I guess not. I'll stick to the family owned restaurants as I always have.

Problem was they were all dirty.  I said we would wait.   We then sat at a small table and waited for the server.  He was timely but looked like he just ran a marathon and/or crawl out of kitchen after fixing equipment or something.  He was wearing a tee shirt that look like he slept in it.  He had on dirty jeans and was sweating all over his face.  All the servers actually looked like they needed a scrubbing wearing a  messy uniform.     We reluctantly ordered our food knowing he was unlikely cooking the food.  I ate half my salad when I found hair in it.  I did take a picture not knowing what to do with this.   The server was pleasant but I couldn't get out of there fast enough.  I asked for the bill and he said I had to use the kiosk at the table.  What a PIA... never again will I go back there.  I prefer to be served my bill.  The whole experience was disgusting and disappointing.  What a turn-off!

I ordered the spicy tacos, which are my fav, but I must admit I've been hesitate to order anymore because it's like it's just thrown together, either missing something or just the presentation doesn't look good. My taco was missing the sauce, had to wave our ""happy"" waitress down to get more sauce. So the tacos were just okay, I've had better but they did the job. My friend ordered the white spinach queso dip which was soooooo good! I was excited because there other queso is good but since I don't eat meat anymore i can't eat it but this new one was on point. I'd go back just to get that. Me and my friend closed the restaurant out and I can tell our waitress was annoyed because she now wanted to keep walking past our table giving us the nice side eye, but our bill was already paid, and let me say I do love that you can pay on the table now, it's so much better than waiting forever for the waiter/waitress to bring the bill etc. Overall my experience was just okay, it's a franchise, so that's usually what you get, but I might swing back to get that queso.

The prices are reasonable. I think we got our dinners 2 for $20.  I had the vegetable fajitas, hubby had the steak fajitas. Mine came with lots of veggies, some beans, some rice, usual Mexican fix ins of cheese, guac & sour cream. Hubby had to order beans & rice on the side because the meat fajitas don't come with them. Everything tasted decent, wouldn't say it was out of this world, but definitely not terrible either.  I felt they could have given us more tortillas, it seemed they gave us a small amount to share. We could have asked for more but we were okay with the 3 between us, at least I was. Still it would have been nice to have a little more in the tortilla pot.

My steak wasn't cooked right, we didn't get water at the table till the end of our meal when we actually asked for it.  They brought 2 extra drinks that we didn't order. And never asked if we want more drinks after they served the 1sr round.  Not a place that I would come back too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-farmingdale,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32

7,Tayla L.,"Manhattan, NY",139,98,272.0,5.0,2016-04-19,"I always visit this Chili's when its on my mind whenever I'm in the area. There's never too long of a wait to eat in or take out. We only sit in the bar section with the 7-8 TVs and theres usually different games/stations occupying each one. The whole kiosk system makes things great for checkout - swipe and go and the receipt is printed right at the table. We usually have coupons for free something whether it be desert or apps and the employees never give us a hard time with taking it to-go (most coupons are dine-in only). Drinks are good, food arrives in a timely manner and I have no memorable complaints from any of our visits!

The appetizers were all fried.  I was looking for greener pastures.  But you can't win them all? Or can you?  I told the server that I was disappointed and she told me that she would take note.  I felt like I made a difference.

The salad was small, but fresh.  The fajitas were served hot  and sizzling with sides of tortillas, salsa, sour cream and tomatoes.  Lettuce was missing ?   We took the dessert home (molten lava cake), and although I enjoyed it the next day I am sure it would have been heavenly right out of the oven.  The deal was great for the price and it was the perfect amount of food for a light dinner    The convenient way to pay with the table side computer was quick, and kept my credit card within sight at all times    A definite plus!   Service was good with a two server team approach",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-farmingdale,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56

1,Eric P.,"Baldwin, NY",57,296,,2.0,2017-10-06,My wife and I went to Chili's for dinner yesterday. It had been quite a while since I went to a Chili's and after yesterday I know that was a correct decision. We were seated quickly and ordered a bowl of chili a side salad a chicken fajita and some dry rub ribs. The chili was burned and inedible and had to be returned. The salad was ok but not inspired. The chicken fajita was very pedestrian and the sides were rather small.The ribs were not great but were acceptable.Even with the 50% off coupon the food was rather poor.Service was very good and was responsive.The price to value ratio is around average for this type of restaurant. All in all this was a poor experience and I will not be returning in the future.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-farmingdale,3.2,3.2,3.2,,3.2000000000000006
8,Mike T.,"Lindenhurst, NY",0,7,,3.0,2017-12-03,"I used to think Chili's was one of the best options out of the ""casual dining"" choices, but my last visit was mediocre at best.  Upon entering to put my name on the wait list, there was a hostess who looked completely disinterested in helping anyone and just seemed to be leaning over the wait list area.  I had to basically get her attention to add my name on the waitlist, it was busy and we were told about 30-45 minutes.  The quoted time turned out to be correct which was expected and fine. I will say service was solid, server was friendly and timing on food and drinks was good which is the reason I didn't rate lower.  The real disappointment is with the food, in the past I always felt the fajitas were a good option here and it doesn't seem that way any longer.  I felt the chicken was sort of rubbery, and the steak and shrimp was overly seasoned to the point where it was difficult to really enjoy it.  Every now and then it seems like a good idea to bring the family to a place like this, and then I guess I tend to regret it.  I understand Chili's is a chain and I know not to expect really high quality food, but the overall experience seems to have become ""eh, it's ok"".  I probably will return because of the kid-friendly atmosphere and I like them better then Applebee's, maybe I'll try something else next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-farmingdale,3.2,3.2,3.2,,3.2000000000000006

When he came back, I put in my food order.  I ordered the margarita grilled chicken.  It comes on bed of black beans and rice with some tortilla strips.  It was pretty good. Chili's fall into a range if you have ever been.  You will usually have an okay to good meal.  I think it is a good Chili's and the staff has always been friendly.  If you like that kind of place, definitely go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-farmingdale,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006
