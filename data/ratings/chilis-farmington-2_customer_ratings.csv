6,Megan M.,"Farmington, NM",0,2,,1.0,2014-08-24,"Service and food keeps going down hill. Made a call in order. My husbands chicken was raw. Had to wait 20 minutes after I called in the order a half hour prior.  Not sure that this makes sense. The bad thing is the only reason we ordered here again is we were given coupons from a previous bad experience.  For the prices, service and food is not up to par. Every time I go they are always out of something it usually being a dessert I want. It is going to be a very long time before I go back if I ever go back to the farmington chilis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-farmington-2,,,,,
4,Derrick Z.,"Shiprock, NM",219,225,173.0,4.0,2014-11-17,we ate here on 11-14-14 around 9 pm for a quick bite. we were not in the mood for a huge dinner. we were seated in the bar and our server melissa did a great job.  i ordered a caribbean salad and my wife ordered a triple dipper appetizer.  our food was good and our drinks were refilled.  our server made a real effort to make sure were were doing well. we've been to this location a number of times.  this particular trip was good.  we were in and out quickly.  our bill for 2 adults before tip was $30.  i would go back to this location again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-farmington-2,,,,,
0,Bill H.,"Carmel, CA",189,352,1299.0,3.0,2015-07-04,"Standard Chili's  within walking distance of Farmington Tesla charger.  Medditeranean chicken salad was 'standard fare' (chicken was a little dry), and pork carnitas soft tacos 'hit the spot' for a quick lunch.   Service was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-farmington-2,,,,,
3,Troy M.,"Pagosa Springs, CO",2,18,33.0,2.0,2016-01-30,"Chips and salsa were good, the rest was well not the best. I have been going to Chili's since the 80's, I'm not sure if I will come back, the food took forever, soup and chili took longer than the burger, never got my water, only one refill, don't take your little ones to the bathroom if they are potty training, one of the dirtiest bathrooms we have been to for a chain restaurant unexpectedly bad, I rather go to a gas station.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-farmington-2,,,,,
5,Larry J.,"Irving, TX",0,22,,5.0,2016-05-14,The food arrived slow but the manager Michael W was awesome fixing the problem.  Always eat here when in the area.  Great chili's store.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-farmington-2,,,,,
2,Donna D.,"Keller, TX",1,26,,2.0,2016-09-10,"The restaurant is not as well kept as you expect a Chili's to be.  The chicken on the Sante Fe Chicken salad had the texture and taste of something cooked several days ago and refrigerated.  The water tasted like they don't use a filter or it was dirty. The flavor of the guacamole was off.   It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't good either. NOT what a Chili's should be.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-farmington-2,,,,,
1,Lisa O.,"Loveland, CO",4,4,,1.0,2017-09-11,"This place is a waste of real estate! The hottest plate had to be the one for a 16 month old baby,,, the rest was mixed up or not arriving at all! My hamburger finally joined the table when everybody else was half way through their dinner,, the onion rings were 25 minutes arriving to accompany the burger,, and that was after asking for them twice!!! Corporate should investigate the sloppy service and dirty interior. We will NEVER ago here again,, neither will friends and family after sharing our experience,, they've all had similar!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-farmington-2,,,,,
