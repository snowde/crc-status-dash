21,Ian P.,"Fayetteville, NC",0,268,23.0,3.0,2012-01-14,Pretty decent chain restaurant burgers. Pretty much the same as any other Chili's restaurant. It gets pretty busy on a payday weekend.

40,Kayla S.,"Fayetteville, NC",2,43,1.0,2.0,2013-01-09,"It gets really bad when a MANAGER has to seat you because she sees no less than 3 different waitresses walk by you without saying a word as you're standing there waiting to be seated... are you kidding me? She had to apologize to us because she was in the back and watched as yet another waitress walked right by us without even asking if we were being waited on. She only came up to us when she saw us getting annoyed. You obviously don't want our service that bad, right? Not only that, if you're a manger, I'm pretty sure you'll say more than just, ""oh yeah we have some new stuff.. we have a new steak with stuff on top"" to two new customers. The food is great, and AFTER you're seated, the waitresses are nice & helpful without being annoying.  If this happens again, I'll just take my business somewhere else. EDIT: This has happened every single time I've come (about 3 or 4 times). Seriously, Chili's, hire some new waitresses that actually care about their job.

41,Dani M.,"Liberty, MO",8,140,5.0,2.0,2013-01-10,It's not the worst Chili's ever. But first off let me say I've been there 4 times since living in North Carolina and we've been here for exactly one year. Every time I walk in when they are not busy servers will walk right past us and not seat us. Last time we waited with 3 other couples for about 15 minutes all the while watching servers stand around at the bar talk to each other and watching them walk past us. Today when we went it took about 8 minutes before anyone noticed us. The person who did looked like a manager or someone and she felt awful. Our server was meh she was socially awkward to say the least. Not talkative and kind of blah and boring. No drink recommendations which was ridiculous. If you are a server and you work at Chili's you should be talking about the margaritas there especially if the person is pulling out the margarita menu. They had a new menu and she didn't even tell us about it she just handed it to us and said there is some new stuff. No big deal. I'm like um? Okay don't try to promote your new menu items..... The food is always awesome though. Props to the people who cook. the drinks are pretty decent. The bartender could use some work whoever it is does not know how the right of amounts of liquids....definitely worst margaritas I've had at Chili's.  The servers helper or whatever didn't even introduce himself. He was awkward. And actually the servers stood around at the frotn like a crowd of about 4 of them just standing there. I'm like wow well you have nothing to do but it took you 10 minutes to seat us.  Honestly the food is good but I recommend going to have it to go because you won't be missing anything if you eat there.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fayetteville?start=20,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152
38,Robi G.,"Charlotte, NC",56,13,3.0,1.0,2013-02-11,"See previous review.  This is a continuation to that visit.... Before going to visit Chili's this particular night, we called ahead to speak to a manager about our previous visit.  Our last experience was a to go order which was completely wrong.  The steaks were over cooked and cold, the sides were wrong, and the fries tasted like they were cooked an hour prior.  The manager that I talked to said that he would put a gift certificate in the mail to compensate our order, since I wasn't able to drive back to the restaurant and get a refund.  I called and explained this situation to the manager, Ian, that night before showing up.  I also told him that I have not received any gift certificates in the mail yet.   He said when we showed up, asked for him and he would take care of things.  We arrived at 5:15 and had to wait about 10 minutes for a table.  We asked our server, Amanda, if Ian was available, she said that she would go tell him.  We waited about 15 minutes and Amanda came back and said that he was busy, but would come out and talk to us shortly.  We proceeded to order the $35 deal, with the appetizer, entrée and dessert.  The appetizer, a half order of Texas cheese fries, was pitiful.  It was a small cast iron skillet of about 15 French fries with burnt cheese and green onions on them.  We ordered the petite sirloins for the entrée.  They came out surprisingly fast, but once again, with cold and over cooked sides.  The loaded mash potatoes were cold and the broccoli was baby food mush.  I still haven't figured out how they cook steaks.  It seemed that they sear one side, flip it over and barely cook the other side.  Now, I did order a rare steak, but one quarter of is was raw, not rare, there is a difference.  We asked Amanda for another side of hot mashed potatoes, which she got back to us very quickly.  Still no Ian.  We finished our steaks and then came out dessert.  Finished that, still no Ian.  After Amanda's helper bussed our table, we were ready to leave; all we needed was the check.  After about ten more minutes when the check was processed at 6:40, an hour and 25 minutes after we got there, out comes Ian with our check.  He told me that he was sorry about our last experience and that he took off the appetizer and dessert.   I would think that if I called ahead of time and told you about a bad experience from the last time, that you, as a manager would make a special effort to make sure that my next experience would be perfect.  It wasn't.  I emailed Chili's ""customer service"" about my problem and nothing happened.  One, if you are in customer service and don't even bother to respond to a customer about their experience then you aren't doing your job and should be fired.  Two, if you have bad customer service (or zero, for that matter) then what does that say for your company.  Congratulations Chili's, you lost customers because of your so called, ""customer service.""  It doesn't affect you too much anyways because you are a corporate chain and really don't care about two customers and their bad experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fayetteville?start=20,2.02,2.02,2.02,2.02,2.02
45,Heather P.,"Morrisville, NC",2,23,1.0,3.0,2013-04-05,"I went here for my birthday one year. It was more funny than anything... At first they brought me the wrong dish, and they didn't have a problem correcting it, they were very nice about it. When they finally brought my dish out, there was a dead bug in it.

30,Rob C.,"Baltimore, MD",0,18,4.0,4.0,2014-01-12,Usually this place isn't that bad. Food has always been good and hot and made they way we asked. People are usually nice as well. Only thing that's wrong about this place is server speed. They usually don't come around very often and my kids are sitting waiting for a refill.  Today for some reason the lady that works up front that seats people was very rude today. Her name is lacy and she had a serious attitude. I asked her if I could sit in a certain area and she said yes but got an attitude right away. Then she took us to the wrong place and I said no I wanted this booth over here and she just walked away. I was forced to pull two tables together by myself and seat my own family.

32,Stacey L.,"Fayetteville, NC",0,6,,1.0,2014-05-14,"Not just the worst experience I've had at Chili's, but the worst experience I've had in any restaurant. WORST customer service ever. This is the first time I've ever been mad enough to actually write a negative review. They have these new tablets on the table. We get there, see a trivia game is going on, looks like some other tables are playing too, cool we'll play. So we play it until dinner comes. When the food arrives, we have four people and a lot of plates so we move the tablet to the empty table behind us. It was like 4 in the afternoon and they were not busy. The waitress seemed irritated that we moved it and put it back on our table, even though we really didn't have room. Felt like we were being rushed. Before we even paid our bill the waitress brings everyone at our table to-go cups of all our drinks, I personally didn't want one and it felt like she was trying to send a message for us to hurry up and leave. There were probably three groups in the whole place besides us, so I don't really understand the rush. Here's the fun part. If you touch that tablet I mentioned, they will charge you for it. It's called a ""table entertainment fee"" and they add it to your bill hoping you won't notice the extra charge. We told our waitress we didn't see any sign saying we would be charged for it and that we felt like she should have told us we would be charged. Her response? It's only a dollar and she agreed that there should be a way to let customers know beforehand but there was nothing she could do about it. Yes, it is only a dollar, but it's the principle of the thing. If people knew you were going to charge they would probably just play on their smartphones that do the same thing. She didn't say I'm sorry, let me get a manager, is there anything I can do for you...nothing. Just, yeah there should be a notice and there's nothing I can do about it. She couldn't get away from the table fast enough and did not come back. Now I see why it was so important to her that the tablet stayed on our table! I made a complaint to someone higher up in the company and got sarcastic responses. That person said there is a notification where you have to agree to the charges before being allowed to play the game. That's funny, why didn't our waitress say anything about this supposed agreement when we complained? No one at our table saw anything like that, and when we complained I would have expected her to say something like ""well you had to agree to the terms and charges before it allowed you to play"". They said next time, I could either enjoy reading USA Today for free on the tablet or have my waitress remove the tablet from the table. That's NOT exactly the response I was expecting to hear from a company customer service rep. I have talked to others who have been charged when their kids played the tablets and they had no idea about the fee. I have also talked to someone who says she has been charged twice and she didn't even use the tablet, just touched it to move it. Besides them being a ripoff, the prolong the payment process. Yes, the waitresses don't even process your payment anymore. You do that yourself. With the tablet. Each person at your table has to swipe their card and do a survey before you can leave...MUCH faster if the waitress would just take them and process them like they would in the past, but we were told they can only do that if we pay with cash now. Won't be back. The food isn't even close to being good enough to make up for the horrible service we received here tonight. There are plenty of restaurants in Fayetteville with better food and MUCH better customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fayetteville?start=20,2.084,2.084,2.084,2.084,2.0840000000000005

I do applaud their attempt to appear to be a higher quality restaurant, but I just can't take them seriously when I go to take a photo of my dinner, and immediately notice a hair.    Yes, the presentation of the table-prepared guacamole was nice, but my burger (I believe it was a Hawaiian burger or spicy-mango), was virtually flavorless. Of course, I'm referring to the second burger, the first was sent back. I also ordered a toffee brownie which tasted several days old and as if it had been stored next to an onion.

Despite the fact that I placed my order in advance, when I arrived at the store it still was not ready. I am confused as to why it wasn't because there was only three other people on the entire restaurant. I was not greeted upon entering the restaurant nor was offered a beverage due to the long wait.  Customer service is definitely not their strong suit at this restaurant.

I was just trying to tell her we needed two refills instead of just the one. Felt really rude.  This is normally our favorite family spot, but today just isn't their day, I guess. Update... that nail put a hole in my pants. Great, now that meal cost me an extra $40.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fayetteville,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
4,Ray J.,"Fayetteville, NC",2,4,1.0,2.0,2017-01-16,"My wife and I frequently go there during our lunch break.  We have always had good, quick service until today.   Our order was placed as soon as we were seated yet it took roughly 35 minutes to get our entrees leaving us five minutes to eat.  This was after checking with several staff members.   The food was just warm and the overall experience was very disappointing considering our previous visits.  Spoke with the manager as we were leaving to let him know that the service was very slow today and his reply was that we should have said something sooner.  Top of his class in customer service skills I see. It will probably be awhile before we return. A quick kudos for the gentleman that runs the bar area...he is excellent.  Did not see him today.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fayetteville,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36

WOW - you were amazing the day we went to have an early lunch on a recent Sunday (01.22.17) of all days. The food was excellent; the establishment clean; management was truly interested in the quality of our visit. We appreciate how well our visit was and plan more in the near future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fayetteville,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
7,Peter G.,"Fort Bragg, NC",2,51,37.0,1.0,2017-02-03,"The family wanted eat at Chili's tonight for a Friday night dinner.  We should have turned around after seeing the parking and trying to find a parking space for 5 minutes.  We all went in sat down and our server came immediately and took our drink order, we were going to get the 3 for $10 menu but the 2 for $22 was much better.  2 of our party got the Fajitas, one got the steak and the other a burger.  Note: Our server did tell us this was his first night.  Our appetizers came out separately, server apologized, they were delicious.  Again, our entrees came out separately, all was well until the person who had the steak saw it was not as ordered, medium, the steak came out blood rare.  We had to wait a bit for the server to come back and told him, even a person who is not a server would have said I will get another one, instead he asked, you want this heated up more, duh, they asked for another steak, didn't want it nuked until done, he took the steak and it took a very long time to replace it, the rest of our party had finished when the steak finally returned, the manager, I assumed asked if everything was ok.  Surprise, when we get the check we get charged twice for steak and an extra side dish.  In closing I think we should have gotten steak for free, since it was messed up and took a long time to get it, our group was a little awkward trying to eat when some did not have food yet and some did, our server never came back to offer more water nor did he offer us desert.  Would you tip ? We did tip, felt bad for server, never should have been put on the hot seat on a very busy night.  Management should've made this right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fayetteville,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4

1,John V.,"Chapel Hill, NC",0,5,,5.0,2018-01-07,Let me tell you about a great waitress. Me and my family went here to celebrate my moms birthday and where we sat had a lot of screaming children. The waitress (Ally or Allie not sure how to spell her name) relocated us to the other side of the restaurant where it was a lot quieter. Our new waitress was Karen and she was very nice also. Excellent service!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fayetteville,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
