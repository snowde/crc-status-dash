34,Sheila G.,"Las Vegas, NV",490,690,1221.0,5.0,2013-02-11,"I never expected to be writing a review for any Chile's in any state in our great union.  This is the kind of chain I never go to.  Oh, years ago, when I first discovered it in Florida, I thought it was the cat's meow.  But then I grew up, my taste buds got more refined, and a looked in disdain at the name and the people who would patronize it.  If anyone had told me I'd be giving this place five stars, I would have thought they'd had a psychological breakdown. But here we were in Flagstaff, on our way to Sedona.  It was raining and cold. It was late-ish. The first place we tried to go to had just closed.  We wanted to take a break, eat some dinner, and be on our way.  So we decided to ""slum"" and stop at Chili's. What a revelation!!   We decided to go with the 2 for $20 special, and started with the Guacamole and Chips.  Stupendous!  The chips were light, crisp, and not overly salted.  The guacamole was a huge portion, bigger than what you'd pay $10 or more at a high-end restaurant.  And it was better!  It tasted freshly made, with big chunks of avocado, tomato, and onion, and well-spiced. I had Margarita Chicken, and it was very, very good.  There were two pieces of chicken, and after all that guacamole, I couldn't finish it.  Hubby ordered Cajun Pasta with chicken, but he didn't want the Alfredo sauce it came with.  No problem - the waiter cheerfully said he could get it with marinara sauce. Despite the fact that we weren't drinking anything except water, and our bill was going to be relatively small, our server, Chris S., was attentive, helpful, and just downright nice.  We were on our way to stay at a timeshare resort, so we knew we'd have a fridge.  Chris brought the box for our chicken, and offered to pack up the chips and salsa (which was also very good) too.  We should have gotten an order of guacamole to go, but thought of it too late!! I'm hoping that the Flagstaff Chili's isn't an aberration, and I'll be trying it out in a couple of different states soon to see if they know something in Flagstaff that the rest of Chili's doesn't know.  I hope not!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-flagstaff?start=20,3.156,3.156,3.156,3.156,3.1560000000000006

14,Ben A.,"Arcadia, CA",4326,743,1968.0,4.0,2015-02-25,"Chili's is dependable in its simplicity... Arguably, nothing exciting has come out of this franchise chain since their catchy ""I want my baby back baby back baby back..."" jingle, immortalized as a part of pop culture by the likes of Austin Powers movies,  etc. And yet, this Chili's sort of stood out to me. On our recent trip to northern Arizona, my young family and I were looking for a place that would be kid friendly, but not annoying like Chuck E. Cheese, or poisonous like McDonald's.  Like Trusty's proverbial grandpappy, Old Reliable from Lady and the Tramp, Chili's glowed bright against the horizon, a beacon of hope on our journey for food before the roads froze. What made this particular location stand out was the service.  It's not always easy to go into a restaurant with three children under six years old.  My kids are pretty well behaved, but still, other guests sometimes rush to judgment at the mere seating of us within three tables of them. Likewise, I've seen servers arguing over who will get stuck at our table.  The jokes on them, because I always tip big when we bring our kids out to dinner, and bigger when people go above and beyond. Our server gave us the little extras like refills on soup at no charge because the kids slurped ours down, extra napkins and kids drink refills without being asked, and ""accidentally"" making a small dessert, bringing it to the table... And then leaving it, ""because they'll just throw it away in the back anyway... You might as well enjoy it with your kids."" This is the kind of above and beyond service that, sadly, often leads to servers moving on from restaurants like this, and going to places where sides are ordered separately to the tune of $25 apiece.  But sufficient for a day is its own evil, and we were very happy with our experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-flagstaff,3.84,3.84,3.84,2.7359999999999998,3.84

With a college schedule and minimum wage jobs, Chili's provides the perfect date night meal with their 2-for-20 meal deals. We usually get the same thing, both ordering either burgers or the Cajun pasta with the chips and salsa or Texas cheese fries. We always, ALWAYS, have amazing service and amazing food. The atmosphere is pleasant and we can always catch an interesting game on the TV's.  Recently, we ordered our usual chips and salsa and a little splurge with getting their delicious skillet queso and the Cajun chicken pasta. However, when our pasta came, both him and I noticed the texture of the noodles to be rubbery and dry. We've never had a problem before so we reported it to our waiter who took it away right away with apologies and a smile, saying he would quickly bring it back better.  The next thing we know, the manager comes out apologizing to us and asking what exactly the problem was, as to not repeat it or to give it to any other customers. After she left, the waiter returned with our bill and told us that our queso had been removed from the bill and that they tested the noodles and the batch did seem somewhat under-cooked and apologized repeatedly. We both thanked him repeatedly and left a hefty tip and a note thanking the staff once again. This restaurant has never dissapointed me. Ive been to Chilis with awful service but this one has never let us down. Ive worked for 4 restaurants and have been a manager.

Confirmed my pick up time with the person on the phone who took my order and it still wasn't ready until 20 minutes after that agreed upon time. I only have a 30 minute lunch break which is why I called it in earlier. I would let this slide as an isolated incident except that the same problem happened to my coworker about a week ago. No apologies were made about why it took so long. I would have complained to the manager in the restaurant but I had run out of time already.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-flagstaff?start=40,3.12,3.12,3.12,2.308,3.1200000000000006

The service was exceptional as they have quite a decent selection of beer on tap. I ordered an appetizer of chips and salsa while I perused the menu and it arrived quickly.

We looked at the menu decided what we wanted and waited for about 15 minutes. Another couple got seated on the table next to us and not even 5 mins later the server of the section gets their drink order and doesn't acknowledge us. We got up and left.

I went back to the hotel and threw it all up after. The food presentation is absolute disgusting, wilted lettuce, cold fries, and shitty soggy nachos.

7,Jenna R.,"Scottsdale, AZ",5,39,,2.0,2017-06-26,"Stopped in for dinner with my boyfriend the other night and we were not impressed. We've been to other locations but this one wasn't the greatest.  Due to recent health problems and allergies, my diet is extremely limited. It's a pain finding restaurants on vacation we can both enjoy. So I figured, Chili's must have something I can eat and we will both be happy. Not exactly how that turned out. Our server was nice, and I know how difficult and annoying it can be trying to accommodate someone with diet restrictions. But, you also need to understand that those people need the assurance they will be taken care of. I settled on the salmon, told her my allergies (so the kitchen or a manager would be aware), and that was it. I'm not sure if she told a manager or the kitchen about it; but it would've been nice to have someone come out and say,""hey just so you know, we are doing what we can to avoid cross contamination while cooking your food."" This is always the standard at every restaurant I have worked at as well. I know it's not a 100% guarantee, and I'm aware there might be some cross contamination even when gloves are changed and the grill is cleaned, but it certainly lessens the chance.  My salmon tasted alright, definitely felt sick later though. My boyfriend said his food wasn't even that good (I think he ordered some wings and cheddar bites). Coming from a guy who will eat just about anything, it must've been pretty bad. It seems like the menu changed quite a bit since we last dined here and we weren't too impressed with it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-flagstaff,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88

My friend ordered the chicken enchilada meal with rice and beans, and she got no rice and beans. The enchilada was bad quality and there was way too much soggy sauce that gave both of us a stomach ache. I ordered a chicken crisper meal, and they gave me about 4 fries total, all soggy. The chicken I got was some random chopped up, soggy grilled chicken. Also no dipping sauce. This experience made me not want to ever eat from chili's again.
