36,Jessica S.,"RINGOES, NJ",46,17,,2.0,2012-08-01,"Out of all the chain restaurants Chili's is one of our favorites, but the Flamington location has bad take out service.  First, they always take double the time they tell you, so you are always waiting.  Second, the order is never accurate.  They usually get the meal right, but there is always something wrong or missing.  We have gotten burgers missing fries, salads without dressing, boneless wings missing the sauce, etc.  There doesn't seem to be quality control.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-flemington?start=20,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000004
41,Bill B.,"Cleveland, OH",0,24,5.0,1.0,2012-09-29,"Service here is the worst!  Waited more than 15 minutes for a server to show up (with no water or utensils/napkins) and take our drink. Ended up having to tell him (twice) before we got utensils/napkins, by which time our appetizers were cold.  The entree definitely did not look anything like the picture in the menu, and taste was just OK.  Would not recommend the Chili's in Flemington, NJ due to the poor service.  Chili's in general I would give 3 stars (average for a chain restaurant).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-flemington?start=40,1.8600000000000003,1.8600000000000003,1.8600000000000003,1.8600000000000003,1.8600000000000005
40,Melissa D.,"Parsippany, NJ",0,5,,1.0,2013-01-15,"Worst Chilli's experience I ever had, and Chilli's is my favorite chain restaurant. I sincerely wish I could give this place a -5 stars. So bad, that after this review I'm going to try and email or contact someone in corporate. Horrible experience. So my boyfriend and I arrive and the hostess gets to us right away. The quick service is a short-lived joy because she brings us first to a dirty table and stammers---""Uh..Um..Okay, let's just go this way"". WE lead her out of the crowded area and she looks around desperately to try and cover her tracks. She points us to another table and scurries away. This wasn't that big of a deal to us, but it certainly was the start to a bad night out. Our waitress comes over after some time (I really wish I remembered her name--If I get it I'll edit it in here) and takes our drink order. She slams down the drinks and walks away. From the beginning, she wasn't too kind but this made me ask my boyfriend jokingly ""did you do something wrong to this woman in a past life?"" (of course he had no clue who she was). That's how rude she was to begin with.  We order our food and it comes eventually. Our waitress doesn't check up on us at all in the meantime. We finally do get our food, and I notice the portion sizes are rather small to what we normally get. I looked past that and was looking forward to our meal. However...in one of the fries, a piece of hair was fried into it. I was disgusted and lost my appetite almost immediately. Of course, our waitress took forever to come around to check on us, and when she did we reported the mess to her. She seemed disgusted, rightfully so. She took the fry into a napkin and told us that she would show this to her manager, who we could see from where we were sitting. We watched intently as we see him actively shaking his head and throwing his arms up in the air in a ""I give up"" sort of matter. We expected him to come over and apologize to us right away. We waited...and waited...and waited. He never came, not once throughout our entire visit. We heard no word from our waitress, and the manager never came over, and we sat there dumbfoundly. My boyfriend ate the rest of his food, and I pushed my plate to the side because I couldn't stomach being in the place anymore. Our waitress FINALLY, again with the poor service, shows up and asks if we'd like anything else. I shoot my boyfriend a disgusted look, and he says, ""Um, yes. Is the manager going to come over to us? What's going on with that situation?"" She replies ""Oh yeah. We took your meal off the bill. No need for him to come over."" Seriously?! It's common courtesy to apologize for a disgusting move like that. It's not like the hair had just fallen onto my food. It was DEEP FRIED into a fry! And the staff was willing to shrug it off like no big deal? Disgusting. As we were leaving, my boyfriend told the hostess that it was not the rude service or the disgusting fry mishap, but the fact that the manager neglected to come over and talk to us that would forever keep us away from their establishment. Not only was our experience, the staff, and the food horrible--the bathrooms were DISGUSTING and horribly maintained. If the bathrooms, that are to the public eye, are that gross, who knows what the kitchen looks like? I made sure to snap a few photos before we left to email to someone higher up. I spent the past five minutes typing this out, and I'm not a big reviewer. Stay away, this place is horrible. Not even worth a quick bite to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-flemington?start=40,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003

We asked her for a gluten free option list and told our server that two out of three of us were gluten free, specifying who was gluten free with each order.  We waited 1/2 an hour for our order. When asked why people who came in way after us got their order before us, she tried to say it was because of the gluten free orders, which was BS--a steak and a burger without the bun. She put the ticket in late. What pissed me off more was that she made no apology, she acted like a kid who got caught screwing around and threw the blame on the kitchen. Not good customer service.

The floor was dirty and another table complained too. It took them 15 minutes to clean up the trashed floor. The service was worse. It took over 45 minutes to get out nuked food. The server claimed they were busy with an attitude. When the rest of my meal even took longer, I asked to see the manager. like another reviewer wrote, this wasn't permitted. I went away from the customers and called the manger who had an attitude too. She claimed they were busy, which wasn't true. I said she was not organized and not trained. You could see that the staff wanted the money, but not the work. They all gathered by the cash register and talked to one another instead of doing their job. Small portions, a dirty floor and smart mouthed kids. I wonder if the owner wondered why there was very little business. I had the same slow service on a Saturday too when they didn't have much business. I am sure they are open for the bar only. The manager must be tight with the owner is all that I can say.

I would describe Chili's as a step-up of TGI Friday's. The food was great and so was the service. Our waitress was very attentive even though the place was jam packed due to the fact that it was Sunday football and they have all day happy-hour. I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries. Ordered an appetizer of fresh Guacamole and chips and they actually make it for you right on your table which I thought was really cool because you could choose how spicy to make it.

28,Steve R.,"Danville, CA",37,139,77.0,3.0,2015-01-12,"We were looking for an easy lunch with the baby on a Sunday at a place that would be showing the NFL playoffs. Chili's was our choice. We were seated right away. I haven't been to a Chili's in a while but I found the decor to be nice and the energy level to be high and fun. I didn't care for the tablet computer that they had on the tables. We try to avoid using our phones at the table and here the restaurant has a distracting tablet on the table. It's not my thing. I think they charged for games too so even if we were going to try to set the baby up with something, there was an extra charge (though at first glance I think it was nominal). The service was great; the waitstaff were extremely friendly. The food was also tasty. I found the fix ins for the fajitas to be skimpy - maybe three jalapeños though I am sure if I asked for more I could have gotten them. Altogether, Chili's helped us enjoy an impromptu lunch with the baby and we will most certainly be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-flemington?start=20,,,,,

Tonight though was the worst experience we've had ever. First the host wasn't even paying attention to us when we came in then when we sat down were waiting for like 20mins then we had to ask to get the service. We ordered our food appetizers and drinks at the same time took another 10 mins to get our drinks then waited awhile for our appetizers which arrived the same time as the food which I hate. It's an appetizer for a reason. Then my boyfriends meal didn't come with the vegetables that it was suppose to. Only reason we were surprised about it is because we overheard the waiter talking to the table next to us saying try ran out of asparagus but didn't let us know. My boyfriend was looking forward to the vegetables since he restricts himself on certain meals. So it was just a. Steak on a plate. The waiter should have told us so he could have asked for a substitute, but didn't. Also my drink wasn't correct and the waiter said that it was because he didn't do as many pumps of the flavor as they usually do. Pretty sure there's always a set amount that they have to do in drinks since I've always ordered the same blackberry lemonade and it always stayed the same. Then the waiter didn't even come to check on us once. We don't know if this waiter Jonathan was new but the service was horrible.

The meals were VERY different from the pictures. For example the food was in different portions and looked completely different, whilst the portions completely varied. The overall taste and feeling after was atrocious. Also I would. Like to mention that the atmosphere was not at all inviting, in the short time I was there I saw a overall mess, and even a waiter scratching his back against a pole.

The restaurant itself was nice, it looked new enough and clean enough.

My friends and I had just talked about how almost all chain restaurants get bad reviews which we all thought was bad because ourselves we like chain restaurants, not everyone, but they do warrant a good review now and there, well this chili's was not the case. My food came out, I didn't order Mexican , maybe that was the mistake., but I ordered s burger. The burger itself, which I upgraded to grass fed I could tell was quality meat but it was a little flavorless, which I'm surprised at since most other reviews said everything was over salted - this was not. The bun was gross... it was like a potato bun gone bad. The whole thing was very greasy but considering my burger, which was supposed to cooked with pink, but there was no pink to be seen, was not greasy in the slightest, I guess it was the cheese? And then those garlic pickles - Ick! Don't eat them. I don't know why they put them with everything. And my fries which I started with were cold, season-less, limp and tasted like someone had just microwaved them. This chilis definitely missed the bar and I can see why, in this case, a chain restaurant got a bad review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-flemington,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
0,Alex L.,"Hillsborough Township, NJ",17,3,,4.0,2017-08-04,"for a chili's, this establishment was exquisite. my friend and i had decided on attending this chili's due to a popular meme where people say, ""hi welcome to chili's"". we ordered chips and guac for the table and we were impressed! i got the mango iced tea as well as the triple dipper combo for $11.99. i was completely satisfied. i saw that this chili's was rated 2.5/5 stars but it was just as satisfying as my local neighborhood applebee's. i would definitely recommend this chili's as well as my server julia, she was very nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-flemington,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
8,Kim P.,"Dunellen, NJ",590,48,1.0,1.0,2017-08-12,If I could give zero stars I would. The service here is absolutely horrendous. We ended up walking out before our drinks came because the waitress was so slow. We didn't want to risk being stuck there forever. Also I witnessed a man with a beard down to his chest area walk out of the kitchen without any hair net covering it. So that was the deciding factor to leave. Go elsewhere. Friday's survive was exceptional and they're located just down the road.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-flemington,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
6,Berna G.,"Skillman, NJ",6,12,1.0,1.0,2017-09-06,"Awful- just awful. My husband ordered a burger- medium well. Was bleeding and greasy when he got it. He also asked for a side of broccoli instead of fries- was served 3 pieces. I ordered the appetizer sampler as my entree to share, but did not get what I wanted. Of course our server wrote nothing down...alway a flag when ordering anywhere. Plus- she never reappeared for me to let her know I didn't get what I ordered or to refill beverages. Oh whelp. Lesson learned. Fool me once...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-flemington,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36
