35,Chris E.,"Erlanger, KY",0,1,,4.0,2012-02-02,I have been to Chili's a couple of times and done the 2 for $20 without a problem.  Recently we went with the whole family and everyone enjoyed the food.  The night that we went there were a lot of children/babies in the restaurant so it might have been a kids eat free night.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florence-8?start=20,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003

31,Dale C.,"Hebron, KY",71,3,,4.0,2012-04-11,Good service! Had the 2 for $20 deal. 1/2 order of Texas Cheese Fries (very good) and the wife had chicken fajitas while I enjoyed the 1/2 rack dry Memphis rub ribs (use the sauce served on the side). Loved paying from the kiosk on the table. All very good!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florence-8?start=20,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997
29,Mike G.,"Union, KY",2,158,5.0,2.0,2012-07-22,"The food was not anything special.  The chips were good but the food could be better.  It was a late dinner so maybe that had something to do with this but the service was not great, not bad-just not great.  It seemed as they were just circuling our table to husher us out.  No doubt everybody wants to go home at the end of a long day but in this economy if someone goes out to spend some money, let them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florence-8?start=20,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44
28,Cody P.,"Burlington, KY",0,21,,4.0,2012-07-27,"Went to Chili's for lunch today.  The hostess was very friendly and was able to seat us right away.  Our waitress was prompt, attentive and friendly as well.  The food is good for a chain restaurant.  They have several selections on the lunch combo menu starting at only $6 each.  I opted for the grilled chicken salad from the Lighter Side menu.  It was very good but a bit over priced IMO.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florence-8?start=20,,,,,
16,Mikey M.,"Newport, KY",76,21,555.0,5.0,2012-11-21,"As my dad would say : ""Chili's is the best restaurant out there, that, and Mc Donalds"". I agree with the Chili's part, that's for sure. The food here is delicious, the service is fast, and the chips are amazingly good. My family and I try to get out here at least once a week, and it's not the closest restaurant either. I get the Cajun Chicken Pasta every time, and it is great, absolutely fantastic. I can testimony Chili's for anyone, families, clubs, get togethers, and parties even. I had my birthday here, and a delicious, (but scalding hot) chocolate cake is brought out topped with vanilla ice cream for free. All my other family members can recommend the potato soup, which I tried myself, and it was of course ; great. My only nit pick of this restaurant : I wish it was closer!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florence-8,,,,,

27,Terry D.,"Independence, KY",0,1,,2.0,2013-05-10,"Placed a simple to go order. Grilled chicken sandwich with lettuce and tomato only.

11,Sarah H.,"Covington, KY",147,223,122.0,3.0,2014-11-11,"Service was good, even when they were extremely busy.. I just wasn't impressed by the food. I ordered the sirloin and it was just a really low quality meat. If I come back, I'll probably stick to an appetizer as my meal. Aside from that, the noise level was through the roof. Every single table had at least one small child. I feel bad for the servers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florence-8,,,,,
18,Robert D.,"Maybee, MI",0,2,,1.0,2015-04-27,6pm mom. I walked sat at the bar there were about five other people there. There wasn't any bartender around three or four waitresses walk by.

13,Geri L.,"Dry Ridge, KY",23,41,4.0,4.0,2015-05-27,"Our service was very good. I accidentally spilled tea on me & our waitress brought more napkins to help me clean up mess. While I thought the food was very goid, my husband was not impressed. He got steamed broccoli & asked for extra butter . The butter would not melt on the broccoli.  He was also not impresses by the mash potatos, but he doesn't like melted cheese either. I tasted his potatoes & thought they were very good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florence-8,,,,,
7,Ivet V.,"Newport, KY",86,118,760.0,4.0,2015-08-09,"When I want comfort good I come here, the famous crispy tenders are the best with the signature fries but today I  got the buffalo chicken sandwhich with a side of fries which was very satisfying.  To end my meal I got the be new Oreo molten cake which was very delicious. I love the original chocolate molten cake but this cake had the best of both worlds, chocolate and vanilla , topped with a big scoop of ice cream and then sprinkled with Oreo cookie crumbs served nice and warm!  Almost had to ask for some milk !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florence-8,,,,,
12,Jennifer N.,"Cincinnati, OH",66,124,7.0,5.0,2015-10-15,I love chili's they have the best burgers ( black bean that is) and I really really love their nachos!! They give you a really big pile of them ( which is a plus for me) and if you happen to not finish them all they even give you a bag to take them home which is another plus for me because honestly who likes wasting food?? Another cool feature?? They have tablets to play games and you can also pay your check!! The staff is so friendly so I'll definitely be going back!! Chili's it's amazing!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florence-8,,,,,
17,Rick D.,"Walton, KY",8,1,,1.0,2015-10-29,"After a long 2 and a half hour flight, I decided to pick up chilis on the way home. I called in my order and the person on the phone repeated it back to me. I show up and they have no confirmation of my order. They don't offer to rush another order or anything, just keep saying there is nothing they can do. Worst customer service ever. Will never go back!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florence-8,,,,,
6,Michael C.,"Florence, KY",56,32,14.0,3.0,2016-02-17,"You know what you are getting into a Chilis. If my kid hadn't asked for it on her birthday, I think I would have found a way to avoid the place for several more months.  Still, we were seated quickly. Our waiter Youssef was attentive. The children enjoyed their kids meals and even tried some different entries. And the coke fountain system didn't disappoint.  I order chicken crispers, because if i want fajitas I go to the mexican place up the road. Chilis chicken crispers are awesome junk food when they are done right. But this night, maybe they didn't want to bother with the batter. My ""crispers"" were the most paltry chicken tenders you ever saw. Looked like they came straight from the kids meal my kids didn't order that night. The kids went with burgers. So should I have. Next time: order a burger (maybe a chicken sandwich) and be done with it. But sit in Youssef's section if he is working.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florence-8,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006

19,Tom T.,"Florence, KY",0,20,,2.0,2016-03-28,"I cringe every time my wife wants to go here, $40 for 2 chicken sandwiches, $3.00 for a pop, servers who can only ask you ""did you leave room for desert"", then disappear for 20 minutes till they bring the bill, skip it, typical overpriced, uninteresting food, convict kitchen staff to stoned to read what you did or didn't want on your order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florence-8,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006
10,Emily M.,"Independence, KY",92,5,2.0,1.0,2016-05-08,"Ate there today for Mothers Day, and let's just say I had two bites of my food. I ordered a Medium rare steak with a side of mashed potatoes. My first steak that came out wasn't even red/pink in the middle. The whole steak was brown, but not cooked brown, it looked like it had been sitting out for a long period of time and then they cooked it, so at no point would it have been red/pink. After I took one bite I could tell something was wrong, it tasted really weird and so I had them cook another ""fresh"" steak. They bring it out and it looked the exact same. I took a picture of it and then she walked away and gotten her manager. The manager came back and said so I heard something is wrong with the Serivce? I was not trying to be rude, or make this an issue but the manager just came out acting super rude. She said ""I looked at the steak it looks fine, how do you want it cooked? Is it not being cooked right?"" I said I want it cooked medium rare which means pink/ red in the middle, when you look at that steak it is not pink or red the entire thing is brown, even where it isn't fully cooked. She then tried to argue and then act like okay well do you want something else on the menu? I said no I don't want anything, so she took it off the bill.  I will not be eating there, nor would I recommend anyone eat a steak from there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florence-8,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005

0,Marcus M.,"Indianapolis, IN",23,138,561.0,4.0,2017-07-17,"This was a sweet and delicious take on chicken and waffles. The serving size was so big that I just ate the chicken and fries and took the waffles home for breakfast for the next day. Two meals for the price of one - I can deal with that. The chicken was the honey chipotle style, while the waffles had a sugar crystal baked inside to maximize the sweetness. No extra syrup needed - in my opinion. You don't want to send your blood sugar through the roof!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florence-8,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004

It took another 10 minutes to get our drinks and it went downhill from there.  The food didn't event rise to the level of average. Some Velveeta with weird meet nuggets called queso was disgusting amd unappealing. What wasnt cold was soggy and unimpressive. The only good thing were their chicken 'crispers' that we ended up sharing because the rest of our food was so gross. After telling our waitress of our bad experience the said ""hopefully we do better next time"" and walked away.

3,Monique S.,"Newport, KY",39,87,249.0,4.0,2017-11-11,"This was the 1st time I'd been to Chili's. My husband and I were actually pretty impressed. We had 2 waitresses while there, Sue and Megan. Both were super friendly and went out of their way to make sure we were satisfied. We got the dinner for 2. It was a pretty good deal. An appetizer and 2 meals for $22. For our appetizer, we got the 1/2 order of Texas cheese fries. They were really good and definitely enough for 2 people. But, it didn't come with enough jalapenos for our taste. We also ordered 2 side salads extra. They were pretty big. The ranch and blue cheese were both really tasty. For my entree, I chose the Cajun chicken pasta. It was quite large. The noodles were covered in a super creamy sauce with big pieces of chicken, served with garlic bread. It was awesome! My husband chose the bacon burger. It was cooked perfectly and was so flavorful and juicy. As his side, he ordered the Mexican street corn. It was unbelievably good. The flavors were on point. I'll definitely be visiting again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florence-8,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92

2,Hannah H.,"Florence, KY",3,51,129.0,3.0,2017-11-24,"Unfortunately their food didn't size up to their quality of service. The service was outstanding! Alicia was prompt to fulfill any needs we had, and did so quickly and with kindness. The restaurant was clean and cutely designed on the inside with a mix of booths, tables, and high tops at the bar. Unfortunately the food wasn't as great. We started with a pick 3 appetizer and we were unpleasantly surprised when it arrived. Their presentation needs some serious help, the appetizer looked sad. And the taste matched how pathetic it looked.  The southwest egg rolls were mushy, the fries pickles soggy, and the chicken was just ok. For our main meals my husband's burger was overcooked and dried out, even though he asked for a pink center. I tasted it and it honestly taste like a fast food burger. My chipotle chicken and waffles was pretty yummy, and the portion was huge, but wasn't enough to save our experience here, and I can't say we'll be back. We hit a $50 check on 1 appetizer and 2 entrees, which for the quality we found to be over priced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florence-8,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8
