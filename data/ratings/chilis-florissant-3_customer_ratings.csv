16,Clinton L.,"Saint Louis, MO",18,18,5.0,4.0,2013-01-08,"Depends on the night. Usually good service, food always seems a bit slow. Clean and delicious though!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florissant-3,,,,,
15,Jason C.,"Tampa, FL",334,208,59.0,4.0,2013-04-23,"Absolutely incredible staff - friendly, prompt and professional!  The food was great and quick check-out system at the table was revolutionary - how did this tale so long to be invented?!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florissant-3,,,,,
10,Trevor J.,"Saint Louis, MO",1,1,,1.0,2013-08-14,"I really can't believe some of these reviews. We ordered online.  Both of our orders were incorrect.  We sent back one, which came back OK. The burgers look a lot like what you'd expect from a fast food restaurant with a nicer looking bun.  The patties were lukewarm, even the new one that came back with the order we sent back. What was really disturbing was the salad, which was only about 50% edible.  Wilted and brown lettuce made up about a quarter of the extremely small container (which I paid extra for). This was my first trip to chilis, and I'm pretty sure it'll be my last.  Avoid at all costs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florissant-3,,,,,
12,Kristen B.,"Bremerton, WA",38,47,19.0,4.0,2013-10-04,They did an awesome job. We went there for dinner right after we got off the plane. The food was awesome and the staff were fast and friendly.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florissant-3,,,,,
9,Bedhead E.,"Saint Louis, MO",5,58,4.0,1.0,2013-11-09,"Some of the other reviewers of this Chili's location have said the service is spotty depending on when you go, and we must have gone at exactly the wrong time, because it took an hour and 45 minutes from the time we walked in until the time we finished our lunch -- way too long for a place like this.  It must have been shift change, because wait staff came to our table three times (drinks, food, and bill -- nothing in between) and it was a different person each time.  Meals must have been ready at least 20 minutes before we received them because they were cold and the buns were hard as rocks, so we think they sat under a heat lamp for quite a while waiting to be delivered to our table.  Wait staff forgot our salads so they came AFTER the rest of the meal, at the same time as the bill. When the waitress (incidentally, management should tell the wait staff that if they have tongue-piercings, please keep them INSIDE the mouth while dealing with customers) asked if everything was all right and we said ""Well, not really,"" she asked if we wanted to see the manager.  We said yes and paid the bill (no telling when we'd have the opportunity to talk to a human again), which was probably a mistake, because the manager never appeared (there probably isn't one).  After waiting 20 minutes or so, we left.  Won't be returning to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florissant-3,,,,,
7,Eva Maria S.,"St. Louis, MO",18,53,100.0,4.0,2014-07-21,"It had been years since I was at chili's it was clean, our food was fresh and the 1/2 turkey sandwich and fries was really good. Ill give the waitress a pass, didn't seem to know much about the menu maybe she was new. Paying at the table using that touch screen thing was my favorite however be ware if you are going to play games on it or do anything other than pay for your meal they'll add on $1.99.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florissant-3,,,,,
11,Ken J.,"Bridgeton, MO",0,4,,3.0,2014-10-05,"We had a great waitress, who tried her best but the kitchen just couldn't get our order out.   When the food finally made it out (about an hour after sitting down) it was very good, and of course still hot.  We probably would have walked out otherwise.  Interestingly, the ""healthy"" dishes, while lower in calories, are a little high in sodium, at least it was for the Salmon. I do like the little computers on the table, yes they are a haven for all sorts of germs, but  you can pay the bill quickly, just wash your hands afterwards.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florissant-3,,,,,
8,Tony H.,"Saint Louis, MO",0,6,,4.0,2016-06-08,We were very impressed with the friendly staff and good food  We had the 1/2 rack of ribs they were very good.mainly  just really impressed with the people working here. I like being able to pay at the table and also being able to page for more drinks ect from the table . very cool,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florissant-3,,,,,
2,Dana D.,"Florissant, MO",15,59,338.0,3.0,2016-10-15,The food was delicious but while placing my to go order I had a view of the prep area.  I could over hear them talking and the conversation wasn't customer friendly or appropriate.  That is the reason for 3 stars.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florissant-3,,,,,
1,Brett H.,"Godfrey, IL",89,65,156.0,1.0,2016-11-07,"Wow this place is horrible. The hostess told us it would be 10 minute wait to be seated. I noticed that she had told 4 other couples the same thing. The bar had plenty of open tables and the dinning room was empty. Whatever!! Finally get to sit down and the table was dirty. The food here was sub par at best. I wanted a Coors light they were out. No problem, asked for a Bud Light same thing. Who runs out of Bud light in St. Louis?  The waitress pretty much ignored us. I will not ever go back to this location. That's a shame we usually enjoy Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florissant-3,,,,,
6,Valerie J.,"Florissant, MO",1,3,6.0,4.0,2016-11-13,"Happy Hour all day on Sundays! $4 Margarita's! $5 Appetizers! They should add more appetizers for choices. Overall food was good. I ordered their White Spinach Queso and Southwest Chicken Egg rolls, both were to my satisfaction! No one in our party complained about their food. Sorry, I forgot to take pictures... Our waitress could have been quicker with taking our orders. We had about 14 people in our group.. Plus, I hate using those damn machines to pay. I tried giving my card to her, but she directed me to use the machine..  Overall, I would return for happy hour again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florissant-3,,,,,
4,Terri M.,"Florissant, MO",241,10,46.0,1.0,2017-06-17,"This was the worst place I've ever eaten! The service was OK, the food was mediocre, the atmosphere was poor. What really turned me off was the restroom. It was like grade school kids had a poop throwing contest. The one stall that was partially clean had no TP paper. So disgusting. The servers were busy playing grab ass with each other. NEVER AGAIN!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florissant-3,,,,,
5,Monroe D.,"Florissant, MO",0,2,,2.0,2017-09-01,"This was not the best dining experience.  It had been a long time since I've been here.  The service was ok but very slow.  The food did not taste good at all. I had the steak fajita and it was not good. I also had chips and guacamole when salsa and the guac had no flavor. The food took forever to come out and I was fully expecting it to be cold. It was quite the opposite. Very Very hot. That was the saving grace otherwise I would have given 1 star.  My wife had shrimp tacos and she did say they were good, but she definitely agrees with me about the chips and guac.  Definitely no plans to go there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florissant-3,,,,,
3,Dallas C.,"Greenwood, IN",25,1,,1.0,2017-10-23,"Out of chili's restaurant this was very disappointing, the food was subpar and cold in areas and it took way longer than it needed to to even get there which just adds fuel to the very depressing fire that was before me. I should've known that it was going to be bad when it took half an hour to get drinks. Good luck in the future chili's",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florissant-3,,,,,
0,Veronica L.,"Saint Louis, MO",0,1,2.0,4.0,2017-11-06,"Today I had the luck and walked into $5 margaritas, the pineapple blueberry is sooo good, the service is good and the food was good, I just wanted some nachos. I was happy about the drinks!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-florissant-3,,,,,
