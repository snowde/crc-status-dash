I saw two other curbside folks wait and eventually walk in. They got there food as soon as they walked in. I waited another 10 minutes.

I used to work at one and went through the menu several times while there so I'm pretty burned out on it. But I have to say, some of the things they are supposed to do best are just mediocre. I had the fajitas. The tortillas were stale and the meat was tough. The service was decent and our server was pleasant. If you like Chili's then this is about as good as any of them.

26,Kate C.,"Dallas, TX",930,147,31.0,1.0,2013-12-03,"I guess when businesses are in a small town, the service goes downhill because there is no competition. This is exactly how this Chili's operates. I'm pretty sure the lackluster service starts from the top down, considering the manager just adopted a new rule of only filling the beer glass up to the top of the handle and the rest is head. His excuse? ""It's company policy."" Hey, don't lie to me, I go to other Chili's. The other thing that really ticked me off about this location, was when I went for lunch and ordered water with lemon.

So I asked if she could just add avocados to my burger and that just blew her mind, I had to spell it out for her.  Especially whenever I place an order over the phone, I am always leery as to if it will be correct at all.  Food is great, but if you want service- don't go here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-forney-3?start=20,2.212,2.212,2.212,2.212,2.212

We then walked over to the bar area which had about 8 empty tables, all of which were dirty. My husband asked someone to clean a table, who did so begrudgingly as he told us his shift was almost over. We then sat down for 10 minutes as servers walked by us and never stopped. We finally left when it became clear no one was going to wait on us. Clearly the management was not supervising staff or the quality of service.

The other members of the wait staff were standing around starring at us.  Funny thing is, we were Black and so was the hostess.  I hate to play the race card, but this was blatant in your face racism.  Come on Chilli's of Forney.  This is the year 2015 and all money is green.  Now to blame myself, this is the second and absolute last poor customer service experience I have had at this establishment. Fool me once shame on you, but I am merciful.  Everyone deserves a second chance. You all need to better train employees and get with the times.   I would never call myself a waitress and not acknowledge my customers within 1-5 minutes of being seated.

16,Mike J.,"Dallas, TX",0,24,,3.0,2015-11-08,"We went on a Sunday around 1PM and the restaurant was packed. The wait wasn't too long, just about 15 minutes and they text you when your table is ready which is convenient considering the waiting area inside is small and waiting outside is more comfortable. PROS:  -The server was friendly and attentive.  -The food was tastey (we got an order of Dr. Pepper BBQ ribs and a sampler).  -The food came out relatively fast considering how crowded it was.  CONS:  -The hostess never informed us that they offer self-seating in the bar area, which is where we wanted to sit to watch the football games. By the time we figured it out, a few groups had come in and sat down ahead of us. It wasn't a big deal, but frustrating nonetheless.  -The silverware was filthy. Fork and knife had bits of food on them. The table also had food underneath it from the previous customers and one of the chairs at our table was covered in food and drink. The dining room looked a little cleaner than the bar area so we'll probably try sitting there next time.  Overall, it wasn't a bad experience. It's a little pricier than Applebee's but you get what you pay for because it's also a bit better in my opinion.

It has a nice mix of fresh greens with a spicy kick to the Santa Fe sauce and then the alvacado and Ranch bring u back down! Beef fajitas are good but I would highly recommend the Carnita tacos with cilantro rice and black beans,  top notch!
