43,Amber M.,"Frederick, MD",0,1,,2.0,2016-03-27,"I don't know where to begin. From the start I  had a great feeling it was going to be a good dining experience.  We were greeted by a very friendly Amanda at the bar who shook our hands and all. When seated,(Maybe about a 25 minute wait for our table, which is expected for a Friday night) we loved seeing all the great choices on the menu ,we especially loved the little electronic box we had , something like an Ipad.Finally 20 minutes later here comes our terrible server. Her greeting was ""Do you guys know what you want"", my drink I previously had at the bar was quite low, the server did not ask me if I needed a new drink, it was my friend at the table who asked me. I looked at the server and told her I had a grapefruit Margherita,  I was surprised when she looked at me and made a face that she was grossed out by my selection,  I was so embarrassed that I found myself uncomfortably explaining to her, my husband,  and my friend why I like grapefruit. Anyways,  I actually had to ask her what her name was, it started with an L I believe,  she never gave us her name.  I am in hospitality,  and tried my best to make her feel comfortable and help her out a little.  There was no hope with her, she messed up our order completely.  She did not deliver our food  but never even checked on us when the food was initially bought out. It was the person who delivered our food who got stuck with a list of wrong stuff by another servers doing.My husband's sides were totally wrong, my salad was the wrong salad, and by the way, when she made our table side guacamole,  she commented that she did not know what she was doing,  we practically ended up making it ourselves.  It took our correct  items a while to come out ,by that time we grabbed a team lead who was passing by,she said she was not a actual manager, but she seemed like one, who was awesome,  very apologetic and ended up having to comp our meal. When the server finally showed her face again, no apologies,  no smile,  instead put the blame on her teammate who initially bought our order out by saying the teammate messed up by forgetting to let the cooks know about what we needed,  REALLY. I will say that we loved Mary, Mary would make a great server trainer, she was just very attentive to all the diners, and even though she was not our actual server, it was her that made us want to give Chill's a second chance.She did not have to do that, she was busy with her own tables, cleaning etc. We will be back because the food is awesome,  hopefully the service will get better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frederick?start=40,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000004

What the heck?? Takes our waitress 10-15 to come and great and take our drink order when that takes forever we order appetizer it wasn't until I asked waitress if she had placed the order out appetizer come out 20 minutes later. After being here for over 1 hour and half we were told waitress forgot to put in order after another 15-20 minutes waiting which took for over to get drink refills. We then were told after being at this stupid place that it would be another 25 minutes to get our food if I could give them a zero or negative # I would!!!

14,Melissa J.,"Frederick, MD",9,55,111.0,2.0,2016-04-03,"As far as chain restaurants go, I usually really enjoy chilis. I was excited that one was coming to Frederick. We went around 1:00 on a Sunday. It was busy, and they had just opened so we expected that. We only waited a few minutes to be seated. We were greeted and brought drinks right away. We ordered an appetizer and that came out quickly as well. Unfortunately we waited 35 minutes between the time we finished our appetizer and the time we recieved our entrees. I had ordered a pick three combo and two of the three selections were incorrect.  The server was very nice and the food tasted good. It's certainly not as good as the tex mex at some of the local places, but if you have a picky eater in your party who needs the standard chicken tenders and burger this isn't a bad choice in terms of taste.  It was disappointing that the food took so long and then arrived incorrect. We were not offered any kind of discount or free dessert or anything like that. Some kind of acknowledgement of our inconvenience would have gone a long way.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frederick,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152
9,Chris Z.,"Frederick, MD",7,6,4.0,5.0,2016-04-09,"New restaurant to Frederick but not new most places. What to expect at Chilis? Tex-mex done right. Went tonight for the first time and it was outstanding. 30-45 minute wait but were seated in about 5mins due to call ahead seating. Our waitress was phenomenal and attentive but not over the top. Food was the best I've had at any chili's. I got the carnitas burrito, my father got the smothered chicken burrito and my mother got the Santa Fe salad. The place was packed and we received everything promptly (within 10-12 mins of ordering).  I read the other two reviews and realize every restaurant has their quirks to work out when they first open but either way those reviews were not a fair representation of the restaurant and are probably more of a reflection on the specific staff they had waiting on them.  Solid place, with solid food and a great vibe. I will definitely be going back.  My one negative is there is barely any waiting space for a chain the size of Chili's. Everybody is crammed right in front of the door with seating for about 6 people waiting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frederick,2.42,2.42,2.42,2.42,2.42

So if they were not up to your expectations, give them another try.  They had to work out the kinks.  Go Chili's .

32,Private V.,"Baltimore, MD",3,173,22.0,5.0,2016-04-18,I called in a reservation this past Saturday. The restaurant is located in a easily accessible location by Texas Roadhouse. The food is actually pretty good for a chain restaurant. I ordered a delicious sirloin that came out on a steamy hot plate. I definitely recommend giving this place a try. My waitresses was on key during the entire visit. I was okay with waiting because most places are crowded on Saturday night.

40,Allyson H.,"Frederick, MD",26,9,,1.0,2016-05-02,"We were looking forward to visiting the new Chili's for lunch but wow, what a disappointment. The hostess mumbled something we couldn't make out so we asked if it was ok to just grab a seat on the bar side... where it wasn't very busy at all. We sat at a high top and waited for someone--anyone to acknowledge us. Between the two bartenders and 3 servers wandering around, taking a drink order didn't seem too much to ask... but no one even said ""hello"".  We were about to leave when a guy walked over, stared at me blankly & asked if we wanted ""any iced tea or anything"". I quickly realized how wasted this guy was but couldn't say for sure if he was stoned, drunk or both. We asked for menus, which he brought over & awkwardly put in front of us, rubbing his arm against mine & nearly bumping into our table. He didn't make much sense, was clearly unable to provide decent service and as we were on a fairly tight schedule, hastily but politely made an excuse and left. Who's running this place, we wonder. What a mess. Our local Tex Mex restaurants are wonderful so we won't bother trying again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frederick?start=40,1.8600000000000003,1.8600000000000003,1.8600000000000003,1.8600000000000003,1.8600000000000005
42,LuAnn M.,"Frederick, MD",0,5,,1.0,2016-05-05,"This location is new. We have eaten here 3 times since they opened. The first time was great but that is because we had an experienced server who was from another location who was training the new staff. The second time was awful. Very slow service and when I got my food the chicken was way undercooked. The manager came out and explained that this was unacceptable and that there were problems in the kitchen and he comped our whole bill and apologized. We appreciated that. The third time was last night and that will be the last time until they get things straightened out. We sat down and our server came to take drink and appetizer order. When she brought the drinks back, she then took our dinner order. After a while she came back to check on us we reminded her about the appetizer. She asked if we were ready to order and we told her she already took the dinner order. So of course we got our appetizer at the same time we got our food. She must have forgotten to put the order in. She walked away and I didn't have a plate or the spoon you normally get to scoop out the fajita contents to make the fajita. I reminded her twice about the spoon but she didn't bring it until I was finished my meal. I struggled to use my fork to make them. Didn't work very well and it made a mess. She forgot to bring my husbands salad and when a different server came by and asked if everything was ok, he told us salad didn't come with the meal. We then caught up with our server and said it did and then brought it after my husband was finished with his meal. His fries were cold, she forgot to refill water after asking twice. Oh, and the bus people tried to take our plates before we were even finished. Then the machine on our table to check out and pay wasn't working, so my husband paid the server while I went to get the manager. We did not get an itemized bill to check the total and by this point we were fed up and my husband signed a copy with only the total on it. The manager finally came after being called over and over. She didn't give her name and could have cared less. She said, ""why didn't you come get me sooner?"" Really? It was a culmination of mistakes throughout the entire meal. Now I looked at my credit card and there are two charges on my credit card!  Avoid this place the plague!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frederick?start=40,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003
39,Joe V.,"Germantown, MD",14,8,,1.0,2016-05-09,"1st attempt visiting was opening night. Keeping in mind the learning curve and stress of how busy it was, I had no expectations. Waited 45 min to be seated...completely understandable. Service was not great, food wasn't any better. All things considered, I figured I would give them the benefit of the doubt and try again at a later date. Tonight, several weeks after their grand opening, I attempted to have dinner here again. To my surprise, it was a far worse experience than my first attempt. Only positive thing this time was that I was greeted and promptly seated within 60 secs. The service on the other hand was dreadful. My drink order was taken after about 5 min of being seated. Drinks arrived with no straws 10 min later to which she said she would be right back with them. Another 10 min went by, no server, no straws. I decided to leave rather than further subject myself to any more disappointment. As a whole, I love Chilis, as for this particular location...it's doubtful that I will return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frederick?start=20,1.988,1.988,1.988,1.988,1.988
44,Jamie E.,"Germantown, MD",2,10,,4.0,2016-05-16,"After reading the reviews I think it's funny the way people react to new restaurants. I have gone to chili's 2 times since they opened and there have been hiccups with both visits. Long waits for food, poor service, blah blah blah... but those things are to be expected with new restaurants. And it takes more then a week to work out the issues. Normally the first week is easiest because the training staff is still there. After 2 weeks or so they leave and this is when the hard time come because the new staff is on there own. Give them a break. If you like the concept don't swear you will never return untill you have a bad experience 6months from now. Give them time to figure it out. Don't judge things on how long you waited or poor service... was the food good when it finally came? Yes it was! Then suck it up, realize that you will wait 30 minutes for food, which is great for an opening, and enjoy the meal. The rest will fall into place in time.

Very slow service, bland and cold food, and several mistakes. Also, if you're going to have tablets on the table for convenience, it should be an option for the customers' convenience, not the server's and not a requirement. On our 2nd visit, the server stood at our table and asked if we wanted dessert. We said yes and told her what we wanted. She then told us to order them through the tablet. Huh?

I do want to say, our waitress was very polite and attentive and the spinach queso was pretty good but the entrées were just terrible. I got the ""top shelf"" taco lunch and it was anything but. Just soggy, half-filled tortillas with chicken that was clearly out of a can. The flavor was not pleasing at all. The other person I was with got a quesadilla and it somehow tasted old and burnt but didn't appear burnt. Just bad quality and poor execution. I wasn't expecting much but who can't make a dang taco?

First, the hostess seating us was disengaged and more interested in chatting with her crew mates than seating us. I amazingly had to negotiate for a preferred seating choice in a restaurant that was only half full and she begrudgingly seated us as requested after several requests.  Our server was friendly but lacked the ability to hold an appropriate conversation with her table. When we told her we were there for our anniversary, she immediately shared the it would be hers too had she not been divorced. When I asked about various items on the menu, she said she doesn't eat at Chilis. Weird.  The food and drink were average at best. The final straw was when one of the kitchen crew, obviously on break, came out into the dining area and joined friends of hers who were dining there in a loud conversation. Very strange.  The only thing that connects these events is management and they certainly have a systemic problem at this Chilis location.

33,Debbie M.,"Frederick, MD",27,6,,2.0,2016-07-20,"Hubby and I visited chili's for dinner the other night and sat in the bar. The table was less than clean, a little sticky actually. The absolute only reason I gave two stars was because of our server, who was incredibly nice. My husband ordered a sunrise burger and a beer and I ordered a sirloin steak and asked for a side salad with my vegetables. The steak was to be medium rare. we waited for approximately 12 trivia games... I know that because I played every one on the menu and then some. Our meals finally came and the manager brought them out. my husbands meal looked OK, though the plating was horrible and I could tell almost immediately that my steak was over done. The manager asked me to cut into it to make sure it was medium rare. I cut into it and it was actually well done. He apologized and said he would go back and get me another one. I encouraged my husband to continue eating so his food did not get cold. he finished his dinner we played some more trivia and finally had to call someone over to ask about my food. Shortly there after the food came out, and while the steak was definitely medium rare the broccoli was rockhard as if it had been taken right off of a salad bar. The mashed potatoes that came with it we're not what I requested and I wouldn't have eaten them if they were. They were in a cast-iron pan and looked as if they had been reheated a time or two, were bland and I believe there was probably more cheese than potato. Chili's has always been a go to for us in other cities. I was excited to see Frederick get one, and this was our first visit here. Needless to say we will not be returning.

Every time one of us went at least one entire meal was wrong. The last visit was terrible enough to never be worth trying again. My company's president got a soup and salad lunch combo. We were only given the soup. I had to go back to the store TWICE to get them to give me salad. The take-out cashier treated me like I was a pain in his ass and he was doing me some big favor by giving me part of the meal we had paid for. My meal was completely cold by the time I was done dealing with the soup and salad issue, but it didn't matter because it wouldn't have been edible either way. I ordered the extra crispy chicken strips with extra dipping sauce. Somehow this was translated to ""Pour all of the sauce all over the chicken."" to the kitchen staff. It was beyond disgusting. The entire thing was soggy and half of the breading fell off when I tried picking pieces of chicken up.  I was fed up enough after my second time back that I grabbed a manager's business card. After attempting to eat my meal (I was not going back a fourth time at that point.) and throwing it out, I emailed him. Never got a response.  It's just fail after fail. I won't miss them.

A visit on a Sunday evening with a reasonable amount of customers should be a recipe for an unhurried, enjoyable meal.  Ordered a selection of Margaritas, which, at $10 a throw, ought to be spectacular. My wife's - 'The Classic' ? -- was supposed to be a top shelf Patron cocktail. Neither one of us could detect any tequila in the drink.  Top shelf price -- had I been sitting at the bar I would have sent this back. We were very hungry -- we then ordered some Classic Nachos to share -- $11.95. When you see Nachos on the menu the mental image is of a platter of chips awash in cheeze, green onions and jalapenos. What was presented about 20 minutes later was a dinner plate with 12 individual chips artfully arranged with a small amount of melted cheeze and a pepper on each one. My wife laughed at the server when she set it down. That's right... a buck a chip and not enough to satisfy one person much less three.  Our dinner was presented about a half hour after that. We had a selection of things you would expect that Chilis could do well.... their specialties... fajitas, a quesadilla, some shrimp tacos. All were cold.  So..to recap.... overpriced, small servings, bad cocktails, cold food and unbearably slow, inattentive service.  With an appropriate tip the bill for three came to $90. I don't need a second visit to decide just how awful this is. **** An update:  This was such an unsatisfying experience, I engaged with Chili's Corporate. Being an earnest fellow, I sent them a just-the-facts version of the above via their public e-mail which is published for just this purpose. After a few days went by, someone from HQ called me on the phone. Their message was that ""if I wanted to pursue this further, that I needed to complete a multi-page survey"". If I wanted to talk to them about it, they wouldn't talk to me until their survey was complete.  My message to them was this was no way treat a customer they had already aggreived, but they stuck to their guns, even though they had called me, they wouldn't talk to me until I completed their survey first.  I'm afraid I was not polite.  ""Let me get this straight...I have already taken the time to engage with you and write this up with complete detail, including my transaction numbers, and you ""won't talk to me until I complete your survey""? I have an easier solution. I'll just share my experience with anyone who will listen and never spend a dollar with you again."" Corporate doesn't care about whether any of their locations are under-performing. They don't care about whether you are happy... their system is intended to make engagement with them as difficult and time consuming as possible.  Good customer service teams know how to address this -- admit fault even if it isn't their fault, put yourself in the customers' shoes -- sympethize, apologize -- and refund or provide gift cards to address the deficient experience.  Instead, they called me and steadfastly refused to discuss my concerns, making the whole situation much worse.  Good job. In Frederick Chipotle and Mariachi are right across the street. Recommend you cross it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frederick?start=20,,,,,

34,Jenna H.,"Altoona, PA",0,2,,1.0,2016-11-05,I went there for the first time since it's opened. I called ahead. When my friends and I arrived the two hosts were not welcoming and not friendly. Had an attitude on their face. We got greeted immediately which was great but we ordered the one queso appetizer and it was disgusting. It looked and tasted just like how it looked. I didn't want it to be a big deal I just told our server we didn't like this at all. And she gave us a look and didn't say anything and just took it away. That's not how you handle a situation like that. Then after 25 minutes we got our entrees. My friends and my pasta were both cold. The server never cleared our appetizer plates and full plates. She never came back to check on us. It was terrible service unfortunately. You never know who is coming in your restaurant I'm a manager at another restaurant and the service I had was terrible unfortunately. I will not be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frederick?start=20,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
10,Shawn K.,"Woodsboro, MD",32,9,,1.0,2016-11-13,"We were always big Chili's fans, not so much anymore after visiting this location.   It is important to recognize that any business can have a bad day, but this was much more then that.  The exterior was littered with debris as their trash can and ashtray overflowed with crap.  We ventured in to a vacant reception area.  A host luckily made it the front to greet us after an eight minute wait(yes I timed it.)  She seemed to be trouble by our presence but non-gracefully sat us at a dirty but quant booth anyway.   We pealed the menus(that were drenched in ketchup, BBQ and god knows what else) apart and delicately distributed them to our party of six. Our waiter appeared twelve minutes later (yes I timed it too) and trounced to us through a 80% vacant dining area.  He was not unfriendly but not nice either.  We ordered what appeared to be a marvelous meal.   To Chili's credit the food came out quickly.  Most of the food items were over cooked with cheese hard enough to break a window with.  Bland is an understatement in describing taste. When we got the bill we were sticker shocked.  Looks like Chilis is now going for the Cadillac price but delivering a Yugo feel (for the younger generation a Yugo was a crappy car made in the eighties that fell apart.) Needless to say I don't think we will be eating at the Fredrick Chilis anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frederick,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24

13,Amanda H.,"Cockeysville, MD",43,73,,4.0,2017-01-10,"I think this is one of the better Chili's restaurants since the last 3 years or so it seems like ALL Chili's have kind of gone down hill. My family & I were there on Monday night and it wasn't busy at all. We had prompt & friendly service and everything came out correct and very good. We got lots of refills and the waitress checked back on us multiple times. It was very enjoyable.  My only complaint is the changing policies that probably come from their corporate HQ. I miss getting free chips & salsa, now I have to pay $3.99 and they have an option for ""Ranch"" for an extra dollar. I asked if it was some kind of ranch dip, but no, it's just ranch dressing. Also, I ordered fajitas, which according to the menu come with guacamole, but when they came out without guac, I had to ask for it. The waitress said guac was available upon request only, it just would have been nice if she told me that when I ordered. And I almost forgot, my fajitas had green peppers only, instead of including red or yellow. I'm sure they used to have more variety in the peppers. Fajitas are supposed to have more than just green peppers (and onions, of course).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frederick,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36

5,Larry S.,"Frederick, MD",7,62,66.0,1.0,2017-02-11,I have been to plenty of this chains locations across MD and the US. We first came to this location right after it opened. It was not pleasant to be kind.  So we waited and came back a few more times. It was hit or miss on service and the food was mainly miss. This time it was a total bust.  To start it took 10min to get the salad's. Then the server disappeared. Then the meal took another 10min or so and still no sign of the server. We asked for refills on tea and water from a manager. That manager passed our table 4X and still didn't deliver the drink refills.  The absentee server did show up and took the dessert order. So to recap.  The fajitas were luke warm but the pan was hot. The ribs over cooked and tough and the fries bland and old.  So once again a poor performance at this location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frederick,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24

When we ordered margaritas we did not receive them for at least 10 minutes.  We put in our food order at 6 o'clock. We received our food 40 minutes later. Our server was very nice.  It was unfathomable to me as why a restaurant that had open tables could not get food out to a table for 40 minutes.

Spoiled our Sunday dinner. Never eating at Chili's again.

I gave two stars bc my waiter Jeremiah was really nice and accommodating. I should have ran after my dinner salad came out it was a mix of spinach, spring mix, and iceberg lettuce. The iceberg was not fresh and was brown. Once my meal came my steak was much closer to well done than medium as I ordered it but I was too hungry to complain. That was before I tasted the loaded potatoes they literally had a texture of what I imagine glue mixed with flour would be like. I love bacon and cheese but I couldn't even bring myself to eat that off the top of the potatoes. My side of shrimp wasn't on my plate so I asked for it after attempting to pretend my dinner was good bc I was so hungry. My waiter went to check on them and came back to inform me that they didn't make the plate bc the shrimp that was ready wasn't fresh but they were making me some. When I got them they were laughable and had a weird rank taste to them. I soldiered through the broccoli that had replaced the potatoes and my asparagus which was actually pretty good. My waiter came to ask me how things were going and I jokingly told him they were just 'going' nothing spectacular. Ironically my spicy margarita was AWESOME!!! My waiter finally brought me my check and informed me that he talked to his manager and they comped half of my meal bc even he was not satisfied that I really didn't enjoy my meal. (I never said I wanted a discount or anything) I kindly thanked him and tipped him the difference that I was comped for being such a proactive and accommodating waiter.

Every other menu item we've tried has been inedible at best, and the margaritas are either too sweet or too salty (salt in the bottom of the glass?) depending on the day.
