148,Libby T.,"Manteca, CA",1005,285,395.0,1.0,2013-08-04,"Epic fail.  We visited today following our trip to the Art & Wine Festival, thinking Chili's would be a nice cool place to grab a relaxing bite to eat for ourselves and the kids before we went home. WRONG. When you walk into Chili's, at most locations its a sure bet they always have a super friendly (almost to a fault) host/hostess greeting customers and seating them. Usually its the same here, until now I guess. We weren't greeted at all, and the gal hostessing seemed like she hates her job. No smile, no enthusiasm, not even a neat clean appearance... She was outright rude and dirty looking, and her award winning personality was just as fantastically drab.   Once we were seated, our server (Karla per our receipt) meandered over a few minutes later to take our drink order, however did not introduce herself and seemed already in a rush... Although they were noticeably not slammed. She then brought our drinks (mind you giving a 7-year old an adult sized Strawberry Lemonade, which I wouldn't have allowed) and took our food order. We had been outside in the sun at a festival for HOURS, so I called her over to request some additional waters and a refill on my sons drink. We sat. We sat more. For 8 minutes to be exact watching her chit chat in the take out area with other servers and hang near a table of guests in the corner. No drinks. Finally my husband asked her a 2nd time and she brought them, 11 minutes waiting. Food time - 21 minutes in. Entrées arrive and we ask for a few side items (mayo & ranch), and drink refills. Karla leaves again and never returns. My 7 year old is sitting waiting to eat but needs mayo for her burger.  My husband finally went up to get it himself and spoke with the manager. In the meantime Karla strolls by and says ""did you ask me for something, cause I forgot?"".  As we waited for the manager to bring the items over, the appropriate seating conscientious hostess seats an obviously drunken party of swearing yelling men next to us. Mind you there are plenty of tables open on the other side of the restaurant where they would have been no bother to anyone. I immediately have these guys pounding the table, slamming into the back of me and yell-talking because they are in party mode. My Autistic son has sensory needs, and I had about enough fun for one day. I spoke briefly with the manager, let my son finish eating, and I took him to the car. Neither of us could handle any more. My husband and daughter stayed behind to finish eating, talking to the manager and pay the bill. I never ate. My husband pointed out to the manager a few simple things. One of which was the fact that we have both been in the service/hospitality industries, and neither of us could fathom why a rowdy group like that would have been sat in the quietest part of the restaurant when they could have been sat in the bar or away from families dining?  And second, when did Chili's lower their standards of staff and training? Probably the worst service In years, I am sure their corporate wont care but I will complain to them as well. Although the manager did discount the ticket, that means nothing. Service like this is what causes chains to die. Good luck to them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fremont-2?start=140,2.96,2.96,2.96,2.308,2.96

There are no vegetarian choices in tacos, tostadas or fajitas, so my son ordered the chicken tostada with no chicken, only beans (which was already included on the tostada) and no tomatoes. First order was wrong - it had chicken and tomatoes on it. The server, who was not our waitress, should have read the ticket to ensure she was delivering the correct order.  We got a replacement order, which was correct, but had a short black hair on the plate, and what I thought would be whole black beans was a barely noticeable, watery film of what I assume was bean paste spread on the bottom of the tostada with everything layered on top.  We returned that plate and didn't try for a third time. Fries were old, cold, dry, stale. Got a fresh batch and they were better but not very good. The potatoes didn't taste or feel fresh. I had the mushroom swiss burger, ordered it rare. It was delicious and juicy and the patty was large and one inch tall.   Regarding the ambiance, the windows were very dirty. Greasy kids fingerprints on the inside of most of the windows in the booths facing the parking lot, and the outside of the windows were smeared and dirty. They are not high windows, so it wouldn't be difficult to clean reach over and clean them. The table next to us was leaving when we were being seated, and was not cleaned the whole time we were there. The table next to that one was dirty when we got there and wasn't cleaned either. There were no dirty plates on these tables, but there were crumbs and food particles all over them, with silverware strewn about.  Arguing in the kitchen, and everything that was said in the kitchen was heard across the restaurant. Employees walking past seated customers complaining about their aches and pains to someone halfway across the restaurant, in the kitchen.

Last night, we went to this Chili's but service was really subpar. Our waitress took over 20 minutes to greet us, meanwhile all the other tables around us were being served/taken care of. When she finally took our order for the drinks, it took another 10ish minutes to get it.... and she left without taking our orders for another 10-15 minutes. It seemed most efficient/productive to me that she should have taken our orders while she was still at our table.. Right? Busy or not, at least put in our orders first so at least they can start making it! Finally after another 15 minutes, we got our food. There was no way to flag her down either since she walked by without ever looking at us. On top of all this, she even forgot to bring us one of the things we ordered... And then at the end, when we were paying our bill, she was suddenly friendly with us trying to get a good tip out of us.. We were all so baffled by her sudden change in attitude. Regardless of it all, we still tipped her the normal 15% because it was the right thing to do. (We sat on the right side of the restaurant, after entering, at a table near the window and our waitress was white) The food came out freshly made which is something I always appreciate, however the service really put a bad taste in my mouth.  Spinach artichoke dip is rreally good. Chicken tortilla soup is really good too. Southwest Chicken Soup wasn't great though, there was a ton of potato in my really small cup of soup and it eventually soaked up all the soup before I could finish it. Finally, the chicken enchiladas entree was good enough.. I've definitely had better.  For noticeably better service, I would probably go to Applebees since we can do most of our ordering from the little digital thing on our table.. As well as call our waiter/waitress with it.

119,Daniel J.,"Newark, CA",114,15,13.0,2.0,2015-03-27,"This is a long review, but I think worthwhile to those who read it.  (I especially hope our server, Sophia, reads this...and the manager, Fariba.) My Wife and I walked in, there was no waiting. Friday at 0720. We were seated within 10 minutes, since we were a twosome, and had to wait for a two-top to get bussed. No problem. We were seated, and approached by our waitress, Sophia. I asked her some questions regarding the draught selection. I think I might have confused her, because 10 minutes later, our drinks came and I got a Sam Adams, instead of the Sierra Nevada I decided on. My Wife got her drink as ordered, and we were apologised to by Sophia for the time it took, and for her lack of knowledge regarding the beer selection. Not a problem, I can be a bit of a beer guy, and accepted I must have confused her. I decided to enjoy the Sam Adams she brought me, since I didn't want to wait another ten minutes. She proceeded to take our order, and everything was fine in my book. We received our appetizer, and were done and waiting for our menu order. Clock was about 35 minutes in from ordering. My Wife ordered carnitas/shrimp fajitas. I ordered steak/chicken. (I am uploading pics of my dish, to follow.) My Wife was brought her entree, with her tortillas. I was told by my server that the kitchen had made a mistake with my order, and were fixing it. Still, I was fine with that. By the time my order came out ten minutes later, I was disappointed at the dish placed in front of me, and that my tortillas were now dry/cold. My Wife was waiting, since my meal had not been brought out, but I convinced her to go eat without me. I looked at my meal, and asked a server for a menu. I took pictures at what I ordered, and what I received, looked at my Wife sadly, and told her I couldn't eat it. A few moments later, I asked Sophia to speak to the manager. I also told her that my initial drink order was wrong, and that we would like another round of drinks. I made sure to be clear on my drink order this time. My Wife had changed her selection, and I wanted the SN I had originally ordered. I want to say that Sophia had been every bit as helpful, apologetic, cordial, and customer service minded, as she could be. The manager, Fariba, came to our table, and asked me about my issues. I began by defending our server first. It was not her fault my dinner looked the way it did...I mentioned that I did NOT want to put our waitress on trial, and that my issues were likely training oriented, food management oriented, and that I couldn't even bring myself to eat it. Charred, burned chunks of meat. And not much meat, at that. A TOTAL misrepresentation of the menu. So...while I didn't want to butcher anyone in this review...I will say the following happened...I was given excuses. I was told by the manager that she ""knew right away by your complaint that Sophia doesn't know how to order drinks, and that you must be right."" I was told, ""Our food comes like that, and it won't always look like it does on the menu."" I explained that I have been to numerous Chilli's restaurants, and it didn't look like that ANYWHERE. That I didn't need to hear blame placed on someone else to validate my complaints regarding our meal. I explained that I thought Sophia did EVERYTHING she could to deal with a situation, with the UTMOST respect for customer service.  The manager, Fariba, struck our dinners from our bill. That was a VERY good thing. She continued by trying to give me excuses for everything, told me how bad our waitress was, how she didn't know a hefeweizen from a half glass of water, that their food was packaged a certain way that was out of their control, that our waitress had a DEATH in the family just yesterday...she really threw her under the bus, and unjustly so. When Fariba, (the manager) tried to square it, she made no offers initially, only asked me over and over what I wanted. I told her to be fair, and make ME, the customer, an offer to make it right. When she paid for our meal (not drinks, mind you, which were also wrong) she asked if there was anything else I wanted. I told her I did not want our server fired tonight, due to what happened, that it wasn't her fault, and in fact, I felt it to be the fault of management.  So, in the end, I ended up taking home a to-go box of food I didn't want to eat, and paid about half our bill. After the manager left, I told Sophia I thought she acted in a great way. I asked if I could use her name in my Yelp review. She said yes. I felt terrible for her. We offered our condolences and prayers for her loss. My Wife and I tipped 45% to her. She stood up higher than everyone we encountered tonight. Including her manager, though I was happy Fariba took the time to speak with us, I left feeling she said too many things. Personal things. Excuses. To anyone that is looking for a server, Sophia is your BEST option. God bless her!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fremont-2?start=60,2.12,2.73,2.73,2.3440000000000003,2.486

The thing that I did not like was the little tablet thing on the table. You use it to pay your bill, etc. and for that it is pretty handy. While I was talking to my wife, I looked over and it had a trivia question on it and it said ""Play a game?"" or something like that. So I answered the question and the nine that followed. Hey, I won the trivia game. Cool. It was too much to expect that I'd get a free soda or anything like that, but I confess I was pretty surprised to see a charge for $0.99 for table entertainment on my bill. I can tell you, I never saw anything saying I'd get charged but i was. My waitress did the eye-roll and the whole deal but I never knew I'd get charged. She basically called me a liar. Let me be clear: $0.99 is not going to break me. It is the principal of the thing. Let me push a button saying I agree to a charge of any kind for ""table entertainment"" or anything else. It is a rip-off and it colored my opinion of my experience there. So I charged the waitress $0.99 for small talk (deducting it from her tip). Am I going to Chili's Fremont again?

Their food has gotten so much better. Insanely better. It is actually edible without spending the whole next day or evening in the restroom. I applaud you, chili's.  Their service has been a bit better too. My service yesterday kinda stunk, but I feel like that always happens when you choose to sit in the bar area. The other sections seemed to have put some pep in their step. The bartender never seems to make it out to the table tops often enough. I suggest sitting at a table outside of that area. We got our food a bit cold, but because of what we ordered, it wasn't too bad. My buffalo boneless wings didn't have enough sauce on them...but the server brought me out an extra sauce for free, and that solved that problem.

I had made a reservation for 7 at 7pm, expecting that by the time we arrive, our table would already be set up. When I told them about my reservation, it took them an extra 5-10 minutes to get us situated at a long, skinny table that could barely hold our entrees.  Since there were 7 of us, we ordered 3 ""2 for $20"" deals, while the odd man out ordered their own entree, the 6 oz steak with mashed potatoes and broccoli. We liked the appetizers (chips & guac, chips & salsa, and the cheese fries) but the entrees were pretty bad. My cousin and her friend ordered the chicken strips which were mostly breading and little chicken. I ordered the cajun chicken pasta, which I honestly could have made better at home. My uncle was annoyed since he could barely eat his burger with little to no elbow room since he was sitting at the head of the table. The sitting arrangement was not well thought out. It might have been better for a party of 4 or 5 but not 7. As for my aunt, she absolutely hated her steak. She stated that the texture didn't even feel like meat. She described the taste as having the steak cooked in water then grilled, which makes it seem like it was packaged or frozen or reused.  I don't seem myself coming back here any time soon. The only reason why we went was because my uncle suggested it.

We were looking for somewhere that had a good grilled chicken salad and checked Chili's menu online.  The online menu listed one that sounded good but when we got there and read the actual menu, it turned out that there were several.  I can't remember the actual ""name"" of mine but it had marinated grilled chicken and a quesadilla came with it, quartered and decoratively arranged around the salad.  It was a good size salad, too, and was more than I could eat.  Hubby had a different grilled chicken salad but I think his was a Southwest Chicken Salad and there was a bit of spiciness to it (something I would hate but that he said was ""pretty good"").  Mine would have been spicy too if I hadn't asked to change to a simple Ranch dressing, etc.  They made my salad exactly the way I'd asked for it and that was nice.   The service was very good and our meals came out fast.  Our table had a mini-computer terminal on it (some tables didn't have this) so we were able to pay (and complete a questionnaire) electronically and quickly.   Overall, this was an excellent experience.  Not only was the food very good, the entire process from ordering to eating to paying our bill was as smooth as a finely tuned machine.

For instance, I had the baby back ribs, and they're good, but they're not Texas roadhouse good. I mean, let's be blunt here. They're less than bountiful and the sauce is less than luscious. And I hate saying all this because I know tomorrow I'm going to get a message from ""Chili's"" PR apologizing that my ""experience"" wasn't up to par, yada yada yada, and give me a smarmy plea to give us another chance, yada yada yada, and it's probably somebody in PR that's never had Louisiana or Texas BBQ, never had anything but they're own food. Because this is what happens when you review a well-known chain and say anything that's not 100% flattering. But if you've followed me long enough on Yelp, you know me by now, and know that I review everything whether it was asking for my opinion or not. And so despite my better judgment, I press on. Yes, ""Chili's"" is reliably good if you like second-tier BBQ. I will probably be going back more throughout the years because I'll be raising a family. Did you hear that PR?? (Double-question mark.) I said, I will be back here more throughout the years, whenever I'm ready to gobble B-OK food at reasonable prices that's gentle on my pocketbook. I like the spaciousness of ""Chili's."" I like the fact that it's good for kids for that fact, and gives them a steakhouse type of ambiance with lots to look at, and an amiable staff of waiters good at entertaining kids off the cuff. For myself, I like the Sports TV's. I'm sure kids like the kiosks which gives you the option to order food if the waiter is not there immediately. I also, by the way, had bites of Southwestern egg rolls, chipotle chicken strips and Santa Fe Chicken Wrap in case you were worried I hadn't sampled enough here.

We assume it is our change so we take our to-go boxes and head out. A man comes our yelling at us saying "" hey are you gonna pay for your food?"" Along with him are 2 other employees. Confused, I tell him we just paid and for him to ask Kiely. Kiely comes out and says she gave us change for 50. Im thinking "" why would you give us change if we were ready to pay?""

The loaded mash potatoes were a bit much because they put it in a mini skillet and I wasn't expecting it to be so heavy? But it was still pretty good and wasn't bland.

The cooks at Chipotle now just overcook them and it leaves a bad taste, but THIS is the one."" He definitely loved the pork more than the chicken, and I would have to agree on that.

When we first walked in there was no one to welcome us in and have us seated and we waited about 5 minutes for a host to walk us to our table. We sat down (party of 3) and were served with our drinks. It took the server 20 minutes to take our order and another 20 minutes for the food. My moms ordered the Penne pasta with Shrimp and found chunks of pork in it. Beware that the menu has nothing mentioned about having pork in the pasta. Also we don't eat beef or pork so it was even worse knowing that they made such a huge mistake! The manager said they got their pans mixed up but that's no excuse.

I only have an hour for lunch and we had about 45 minutes to eat. We must of been waiting for 25-30 minutes for any food to come out. I'm pretty frustrated that we can't even get the appetizer? I walk over to the kitchen area and what do I see? My fries sitting there. Why aren't they at my table? I'm already pissed because I knew I didn't even have time to eat. I tell them to give me boxes instead now that I'm out of time and literally within 2 minutes all my food comes out at once not even in the boxes but boxes on the side. Spent 25 dollars on food I didn't even get to enjoy til after work. don't go here if your short on time.

I love the rewards system, just a few simple points and I'll get some free chips, a kids meal for the kids or even a dinner for two!  However, last Sunday, I truly felt so disappointed in not only the service but the food quality as well.  There was only 2 of us in our party, I'm not too sure how you could fall short as a server for a party of 2, but it definitely happened.  Asked for ranch, forgot the ranch. Asked for additional chips, never got. The best part, my fajitas were full of only onions, 1 small slice of a bell pepper and 3 strips of chicken.  Did I complain? Nope! I just ate and made the best of the situation.  However, here's where it gets rough.  Our server dropped our food off and not once came by to ask us how our meal was, nor refill our 'WATER' and generally I base service off of refills.  I can't get upset with a server for food, it's not the servers fault if the food isn't the best, but for refills and checking on customers - that's definitely the servers job.  So, when I looked around, saw that my server had stopped by her other '2' tables multiple times, I was pretty upset. I thought about grabbing the jug of water to refill my drink, but thought... 'Nah! Not worth it!'  After we finished our meals, dying of thirst, she came by and said 'here's your bill, please let me know if you need anything else!'  My reply 'How about some water and a kiosk to input my # for rewards' with a sigh, she said 'Were short on them!'  So, needless to say, no rewards for my meal and definitely no service!'

As soon as we came in, a server told us that it was last call (?!!). They tried to rush our order. We ordered margaritas and the server didn't even ask if we wanted them blended or on the rocks. As a result, we were served blended drinks (which is the default??). In the end, we were trying to pay using the tablet on our table and it didn't have batteries. The manager stuck around our table to make sure that it worked and we paid. All the while our group was trying to have a conversation..  Long story short- don't come here after 9.30 pm.

However, we haven't been in over a year... and in that time, things have really changed...

Three minutes later his soda came, it took my drink another 5 minutes since the bartender was new and had to ""look up the recipe."" We both ordered appetizers he got the make your own combo platter and I got the loaded fries. Even though our waitress was great about coming by to check on us, it took another 14 - 16 minutes to get our appetizers. When they arrived my cheese was already cold and I had to chip it off the skillet , the fries were dry and the plate was not at a proper serving temperature. My counterparts platter had the cheese bites as well which were not warm either making them chewy and almost inedible. After about 10 minutes of trying to consume this inedible platter we requested the check to leave. I was utterly disappointed. Maybe some better teamwork, and better cooks would help.

My date and I walked in around 7:40pm, and it wasn't as crowded as usual and we were the only people waiting for a little bit.  They only had one half of the restaurant tables open.  It seemed like the staff were struggling because there weren't very many of them.  We waited about 7 minutes for a staff to appear to see that we were in the front.  She asked us which of the 2 groups were there first.  My date and I raised our hands, and she like ignored it and kept asking us which one was first.  We kept saying ""us"" and I guess she finally believed us. She said some stuff really fast which I didn't catch (probably that they needed to clear some tables first and then they'd seat us). We sat and waited to get a table.  Even though the place had mostly families, the crowd that night seemed to be kind of rowdy/ shady.  There were a bunch of people there just to eat at the bar thing.  As usual, it was crazy loud in there.  The staff came back to seat us.    The waitress came back almost right away and asked for our drink orders (waters) and we had to ask to get chips, about 15 minutes after when she came back.  We got our food in an average amount of time.  The food was good (I got a smothered burrito which was the size of a newborn baby), though some of the cheese in my burrito was not melted and it was kind dry on the insde.  We got a pizookie for dessert; the cookie itself was as dry as the desert (not dessert), but the ice cream on top made at least the middle edible.  When we were done, the waitress came by and asked if I need a box, and instantly handed me one, which was impressive. When I went to use the restroom, there was a horrible poo smell, coming from I'm guessing the men's bathroom.  When I came back out to go to my table, I overhead a female staff in the kitchen by the bathrooms say hecka loud ""...took a sh*t!""  Um, that's nice.  I don't know about you, but I'd rather not hear people that are involved with preparing my food even mentioning poop, haha.  I thought it was kind of unprofessional.   Basically, the food was good to alright, but the service last night seemed subpar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fremont-2?start=20,1.96,2.11,2.11,1.9320000000000002,2.0500000000000003

Bill comes out for $89, when she comes back it's $94 something; she couldn't explain the discrepancy/increase and was generally incompetent and rude cutting me off when I was trying to explain that we were overcharged.

I came in with my family which was a total of 13 people with 2 people joining us later so really 15 but anyways we came in and we waited close to 45 minutes for someone just to acknowledge us or even get us water. Now ok, fine cool y'all are busy we get that but first off why is there only 2 servers for a normal busy night? So finally after somebody tries to get our drink orders, we wait another approximately 50 minutes for waters again and drinks. no luck. Our waitress is helping other tables and now its getting a bit annoying. So now we tell the manager about the problem, only then the waitress pays attention. So later our appetizers come out with our dinner a long time later and my family wasn't so happy but of course I just took it like ""ok a miscommunication could happened, fine no problem"". But then our food was just horrid where some dishes were cold or had minor things like no sauce or was the wrong dish size (from a dinner entree to appetizer size). Now no problem we just asked her if she could get us sauce please and it took her 30 minutes just to get a sauce again. So later as we are still eating she comes and asks if we want dessert to some of my family which I didn't get because they are still eating? How would somebody order dessert if somebody its still eating the dinner and appetizers you recently brought out. At this point my family and I couldn't believe what was going on with this waitress. The only somewhat accommodating person was the manager but I don't think we are giving our business again. Sorry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fremont-2?start=100,2.12,2.16,2.516,2.148,2.144

I opted for a lighter lunch and got the anchor salmon. Comes with rice and string beans. The salmon was a little too overcooked for me. The rice was okay and the string beans were so old and tough. I had to spit some out because I couldn't even swallow it! We also ordered the chicken fajitas. That was also not so good. The chicken had a weird bounciness to them, almost seemed like the middle wasn't cooked. It came with some wraps, salsa and sour cream and onions.

It's really hard for me to go out to eat sometimes with having a 2 almost 3 year old being very picky on who she interacts with and what she wants to eat.

My sisters and I went to this location for dinner, the hostess and waitresses were nice, we didn't have a problem with them. The management however, was so incredibly rude. I'm upset that we never caught his name. My sister brought her newborn baby to dinner with us in the car seat and stroller. The manager sat us a booth, no area available for us to scoot the stroller into. He immediately told my sister that she could not have her stroller and to take her seat out. My sister said she didn't feel comfortable placing her newborn on an uneven booth seat. She set her on the seat, the car seat did not fit. She turned and told him that she didn't feel comfortable AGAIN. He pulled the table out and her baby's seat dropped a few inches. This shook the baby and woke her up. My sister expressed that she'd feel much more comfortable at a table with chairs and the manager told her that he could not seat us there. We looked around, it was not crowded. There were two men in a six seater table right across from us. We didn't understand why he couldn't seat us elsewhere. My sister gave in and sat down with her child to calm her down. Throughout our evening, the manager would walk by and stare at her and her baby, every single time her walked passed or near our table. My sister felt uncomfortable and unwelcome.

The Manager for this location was not professional, in fact, I beleive she profiled me because of race and treated me indifferent compared to the other customers. When me and my husband walked in and our hostesses seated us, the manager said 'hello' to us as we walked to our table. There was a group of 3-4 that were finishing up that sat behind us; they used the table device to pay and left. We ordered our food, ate and discussed how we were going to tip our waiter (via cash or on our credit card). As we discussed the tip I noticed that the manager was awkwardly lingering by our table. As I took out my credit card she stared at me, then she moved right in front of my table and stood there ... watching me. It made me so uncomfortable, I didn't understand what was going on so I asked her if there was a problem. She explained that there was something wrong with the table devices and their internet connection so she was waiting to see if our device worked. If what she said was true why wouldn't she just take the devices off the table until the issue was resolved? Or have the waiters and waitresses process all payments until the issue was resolved? I told her if the device didn't work I would just pay though the waiter, I also had cash on me that I could use if all else failed. As I initially swiped my card through the table device the manager tried to grab my card so she could swipe it; I have to pull my hand away and tell her 'give me a chance to swipe my card'. She said 'okay' but still stood right next to me watching me swipe my card, select my tip amount, sign my name and enter my email address for the receipt. Honestly, I initially thought she was trying to steal my credit card information, as she stood so close to me, making sure she could see the screen of the table device and attempted to take my card out my hand. Then I realized she thought I wasn't going to pay, so she stood there watching me to ensure I paid before I left.

The Bacon Ranch Chicken Quesadilla barely had any Bacon or chicken. It was about 90% cheese, nothing like the pic, and it costs about $11. Taco bell puts this place to shame with the ingredients they provide.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fremont-2,2.84,2.2,2.456,,2.456

38,Melissa C.,"Fremont, CA",38,5,,1.0,2017-10-17,Very disappointing when you walk in this restaurant and the first reaction for all the employees is to just ignore you instead of seating you.

30,LeAza D.,"Hayward, CA",112,267,866.0,3.0,2017-10-23,"Sat at the bar, since it's happy hour all day Sunday.. surprisingly, it was super busy. Since, there was a Halloween event really close by. We ordered margaritas and a Bloody Mary for drinks. The food wise chili cheese fries and veggie rolls. It, was ok but can't complain about happy hour. Surprisingly, at the bar only one waitress. So give her props for doing it by herself. Only 4 stars cuz the food/drinks was just ok. Plus the restrooms look gross.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fremont-2,3.24,2.27,2.484,,2.6580000000000004
21,Jamie L.,"Union City, CA",12,111,344.0,4.0,2017-10-28,"We had a late lunch here on a Saturday. The place was about half full and we were seated right away. We ordered the following. 1. Full rack of ribs. Half with dry rub and half with house bbq sauce. The latter was better. The dry rub was a bit dry but it was still good. It comes with a whole corn that was a bit mushy. The fries was just okay. 2. Cajun pasta. This was an alfredo based sauce with strips of chicken breasts. The chicken was tasty, moist and has a bit of a kick from black peppers. The pasta was nicely cooked al dente. The sauce was not as thick as I would like. It was still good because we managed to finish the entire thing. It comes with garlic bread.  The service was good. Our food came out fast. Our server kept checking on us and was very good with our soda refills.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fremont-2,3.28,2.3,2.484,,2.692
20,Simon F.,"San Lorenzo, CA",51,500,3317.0,4.0,2017-10-31,"On Saturday I had lunch here with my family and parents. Everyone booed and threw rocks at me when I walked in, and so I felt right at home. (Getting a pitcher of water dumped on my head was a bonus.) A woman and her daughter cut in front of us, but it didn't really matter. They were seated first because it was just the two of them. The hostess was pretty and professional. I was annoyed, however, when she asked me about whether or not we could fit in a booth. The booths here can barely seat 4. The 5 of us would have been packed like sardines in one. I strongly indicated that we needed to be seated at a table (for 6). Wardrobe Malfunction: The woman and her daughter were sitting near us. At one point, the woman's boobs fell out (they just needed some air). Sadly, though, I couldn't get my binoculars up in time. o_O The men's restroom is a little small, and it smelled like bleach when I went in. On the plus side, the restroom was clean. The tables weren't bussed as quickly as they should have been. We could have been seated at this one long table, but it wasn't cleared off for a number of minutes.  Our server was friendly, but kind of slow. I'm not docking for this, but she wasn't available when we really needed her (a group of about 8 took forever to order- some of the people were looking around like they didn't know what a menu was). My dad called the hostess over. To her credit, she filled in for our server and was very quick. (My mom was nice. Our server didn't deserve it, but she received a $15 tip.) A tall busboy made me laugh. He had a goofy look on his face and was basically dressed like a Chippendales dancer. The tables are too close to each other. I felt uncomfortable when a family was suddenly seated at the table behind me. (The area on the left is somewhat spacious, but it wasn't being used. People were encouraged to eat at the bar if they wanted to be seated right away.) Space is an issue in terms of the waiting area too. There are a good number of TV's inside (my dad was watching the Washington-UCLA game). We had to wait about 20 minutes for our food (it was busy here). Our bill was for over $90. Crispy Cheddar Bites: 8/10. ""White and yellow Wisconsin cheese curds topped with chile spices, cilantro. Served with ancho-chile ranch."" No one had any of the ancho-chile ranch. Anyway, I forgot from ordering them in the past that the Crispy Cheddar Bites would be salty (my wife thinks that the food at Chili's is salty in general). Still, they were good, and even my dad had some (he normally stays away from cheese). You receive about 25 Crispy Cheddar Bites, making this item easy to share. Pepper Pal Meals (for kids 12 and under): All the meals are $5.20 or $5.50. The portions are solid, and you can add a 2nd side for only $1. Chicken Dippers ($5.50): 8/10. My son liked his chocolate milk, and he was given a refill. He also liked the Homestyle Fries. The Chicken Dippers are made with all-natural chicken. I had one, and it was softer and tastier than I expected. House BBQ Half Order Ribs ($11.69): 7.5/10. My ribs were meaty and delicious, but I only received 3 (my wife was surprised, and my mom felt so sorry for me that she gave me a lot of her food). My Homestyle Fries were pretty good, but they could have been hotter. I also could have received a bigger portion. The BBQ sauce is just right (it's not too light or too strong in taste). Caribbean Salad with Grilled Chicken: 8/10. ""Pineapple, mandarin oranges, dried cranberries, red bell peppers, green onions, cilantro, sesame seeds with honey-lime dressing."" My wife enjoyed her meal. She just could have been given some more pineapple. The piece of chicken that I had was succulent. It was also so fresh that I had to slap it. ""Oh, behave!"" Mix & Match Trio: 8/10. My mom received a fair amount of food. She was easily able to make 3 fajitas for me. The steak and chicken were cooked nicely. They were also flavorful. The flour tortillas were strong and medium-sized. The shredded cheese was thick and solid in taste. The Mexican rice was spicy (this was a surprise, but not a bad one), but just average tasting. The pieces of shrimp were pretty small, but my mom and wife liked them (I don't know what he ordered, but my dad's meal featured some shrimp too). My mom didn't eat all of her onions, and she forgot to say that she didn't want any bell peppers (they no longer go well with her stomach). We had a nice time, and the staff worked well together. I wasn't happy about everything, but I recommend eating here overall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-fremont-2,3.24,2.33,2.496,,2.6940000000000004
