They were crispy and yummy, not all soggy and oversalted like I remember.  My husband's burger was good too.  Service was pretty good... a few times we had empty glasses and they weren't CRAZY busy.  All in all though, I'd probably go back.. Good food at a low price.  (if you haven't been in a while, give it another chance!)  They're menu looks to have expanded as well!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frisco-5?start=60,2.32,2.32,2.32,2.32,2.32

Waiter was making apology after apology for the delayed arrival of the food.  We don't be going back...too many better options and Chili's just doesn't deserve our patronage.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frisco-5?start=60,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.12

Ok, we were going to a concert about an hour away and didn't have much time.  We used the Chilis app to place a pickup order that had an estimated wait time of 8 minutes.  Since it takes 10 minutes to get there, we thought, GREAT!  Our food will be ready when we get there.   We waited for over THIRTY minutes to get the food.  When we asked where it was, we were told they were packing it up and actually the manager was the one packing it. We are frustrated because we don't think we really have time to eat and not be late for the concert so we rush home to waiting people and hungry children who's kids pizza's were part of the order.  They were they and one other entree were the only correct items on the entire ticket.  We had missing fries, missing sauce, missing sides, the burger had SEVEN fries sitting next to it.  My fajitas came without tortillas, we were missing our appetizer...shall I go on?   Again, the manager was apologetic and said that they were busy and this shouldn't have happened but it did.  It was gracious of her to comp the ticket because of the delay and everything being wrong.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frisco-5?start=40,1.924,1.924,1.924,1.924,1.9240000000000002

48,James G.,"Little Elm, TX",70,273,3.0,1.0,2012-11-19,"I had forgotten that I disliked this place so much and found my self here again tonight.  It had been so long that I figured that just with natural turnover, maybe they would have better service.  Regrettably  it seems to have only gotten worse.  Once again the service was horrible.  We placed our order about 10 minutes after we got there.  After waiting 45 more minutes our food finally arrived.  I ordered a simple burger and when I pulled the rock hard bun off, I noticed that the bacon was burned black and the cheese was dry and crusty.  After waiting 10 minutes for my waitress, I got fed up and went to the hostess stand to request either my waitress or a manager.  Five more minutes later and my waitress finally showed up.  I told her the issues with the burger and she apologized and said she would get me a new one. 15 minutes later the manager came by and apologized.  Five minutes later the manager brought my burger out.  He apologized and said he would take care of us.  He offered a dessert to our kid since he had already finished his meal.  He got an Oreo ice-cream.  After spending over an hour and half at Chili's, and not really getting to eat dinner with my family we were comped a whole $6.95 for the dessert.   Maybe he had read my previous review of this location and figured I was just a lost cause anyway. I wish there was an setting on the Yelp App that would alarm me if I mistakenly walk into this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frisco-5?start=60,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003

I think what this boils down to is just poor management because one the employees that helped us was very sweet.  Most of the service is slow and the whole ""waiter team"" idea I think is kind of silly. Why would you need two different waiters? One thinks the other has already done something when they haven't and the table is left waiting, you feel bad about the tipping, blah blah blah.  The food we received this last time we went was plain nasty. My husband received a tasteless hamburger (how can you mess up a burger??) and felt sick after wards, and I got my usual; the boneless chicken wings. The buffalo wings, which are usually a nice darker orange color with a light battering, came out almost black and completely hard as if they had been sitting under the heating lamp for a couple of hours?? I didn't eat much, that's for sure.  From the sound of other Yelpers experiences this seems to be the norm, so you can't pass it off as a bad day at the establishment. Obviously some changes need to be made. Either way, it would be hard to get us back in the door for the food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frisco-5?start=40,2.088,2.088,2.088,2.088,2.088

This past Friday night at 7:00pm, I experienced service that I feel to be mediocre at best.  Our party of four was told 20-25 minute wait, which is fine for a Friday evening.  The waiting area was crowded, but we found a seat.  After noticing several main dining tables empty and two bar tables empty, I asked if we could sit at a tall bar top table.  I was told no because there were others ahead of me on the list, so I asked if the others had asked to sit at the bar table - seemed reasonable to me.  The hostess said no, but that they had to keep it open in case one of them DID ask to sit there.  This made no sense to me.  About 15 minutes later, after NO ONE had been seated at that bar table, my party was seated at that table!  I'm not sure what management was involved in making this crazy rule, but it makes no sense at all.   In addition, food service was very slow and we received an apology about the kitchen being behind after two meals came out several minutes after the others. The food quality was very poor and not up to Chili's standards in my opinion.  There is way too much competition out there Chili's for you to be slacking in customer service.  Very disappointed and won't be visiting again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frisco-5?start=80,2.088,2.088,2.088,2.088,2.088

Giant got his usual Old Timer and the patty was cooked to hockey-puck state. I tried the grilled turkey sandwich and there was nearly no turkey there. Deli-thin-sliced turkey (yuk), and only about an eighth inch of turkey on it; shredded lettuce, a thin slice of cheese and a single slice of tomato. The bread slices were an inch thick. Each. So what we're talking here is a grilled bread sandwich. Avoid that one at all costs.

The menu is huge, a bit overwhelming, but everything looked great.  The old faithful veggie burger had garlic peppercorn pickles and a fancy bun with an actual black bean patty. It was delicious.

27,Jeff T.,"Frisco, TX",21,78,99.0,2.0,2014-10-29,"I find that what you get at Chili's is completely dependent on the location. This one is unfortunately one of the worst that I have visited. My temperature of my meal was not where it should have been. My wife had the fajitas which were drenched in what I called grease. When the server came by and asked how things were I mentioned the issues to her and she appropriately offered to prepare new dishes. I know this should be acceptable but to me I have already waited for my meal and ingested some food so I do not want to wait again so I declined.  About 10 minutes later a manager came over. I was fine with everything up until this point. She said the grease was some kind of sauce and perhaps there was too much. This was not a time to be correcting a customer. It was like grease to us. She just came across as bothered. Now, understand, not only have I not asked for anything to be taken off I have insisted that I do not want anything taken off. My point was to give them the opportunity to correct a customer issue and I felt like I was being questioned about my opinion on the quality of our meals. I paid the bill and then this manager came over to me and says she is taking half the price of one of the meals off. Now I am offended. Again, did not ask and insisted that nothing be taken off. We had eaten half the meal. I did not expect recompense.  In essence, this manager failed at her role. She missed an incredible opportunity to take some friendly customer feedback and make improvements. Had she handled this that way, I would likely have been willing to come back and try again because I would have seen a desire to improve and a customer focus.

13,Eric T.,"Fort Worth, TX",687,815,2089.0,3.0,2015-06-28,"Stopped in here on a whim after a full day of Saturday shopping in The Colony and Frisco. The wife & I expected a crowd at 9PM, to which this Chili's certainly had. Nonetheless, we were seated within 3-4 minutes. Kudos to the hostess for clearing off a booth right away as opposed to the server doing it. Appetizers of chips and guacamole, along with some watered down red mix of something (not exactly salsa) was okay. The chips were really cut thin, yet we didn't care. We were that hungry, and for $4.99, we weren't complaining. She had water and asked for very little ice on two occasions, yet the server brought back the glass loaded with more ice to sink the Titanic. Again, no big deal, since I was able to take that ice and add it to my mango sweet iced tea. It would just be nice if there was a little attention to detail on a simple request. There was a bit of a wait for the entrees to come out. More like 20-22 minutes. I patted myself on the back for ordering the appetizer. The two of us passed the time away by chatting as well as playing trivia games on a small electronic device that was stationed on the table. I occasionally stole glances at the television mounted on the wall behind my wife, checking the latest ESPN scores (something most wives & girlfriends hate, but whatever). A second server came by to see if the first server was taking care of us, which was nice yet in the back of my mind, I was hoping that she wouldn't steal server #1's table.  The entrees were actually pretty good. I had a plate of the Ancho Salmon, which is a seared chile-rubbed Atlantic salmon, drizzled with spicy citrus sauce and chopped with cilantro & queso fresco. The salmon was served with citrus-chile rice and steamed broccoli. At 600 calories and for $14.99, this entree was just what the doctor ordered, especially this late at night. The wife had a California grilled chicken flatbread, served with sliced avocado, chicken, and shredded Mexican blend chesse. The flatbread comes with pico de gallo, which the wife requested the server to leave off. I think that in leaving the pico de gallo off throws off the flavor some, since the flatbread taste went from its usual outstanding to ""so-so."" When it came time for a refill of my sweetened mango iced tea, the server (the third one to stop at our table of the night) gave me an unsweetened version, and promptly let it drop on the table with a loud thud. She didn't even gather the now-empty first glass of the version that I wanted. No big deal, yet c'mon now. Show a little more attention to detail and courtesy next time server #3, will ya? At the end of the evening, the primary server came back to the table and mentioned that we could pay for the meals while at the table using the handy dandy device that we previously played trivia games on. This option was well appreciated, and quite prompt. No waiting for the server, no fuss, no muss. I placed a decent sized tip on the ticket, yet felt a bit weird by taking the original ticket that the server submitted to me with the costs. I mentioned this to my wife, to which she noted that payment would be recorded immediately. My concern was giving the impression of walking out without paying, considering that I had the original invoice in my hand, along with the now-printed invoice of payment from the device. The server never returned to the table, so I didn't think about it.  The surprise of the night arrived when one of the managers asked if we wanted a free dessert, since he made one extra (not gonna say no to that one). That was especially a nice touch to the evening. Altogether, a pretty decent time at Chili's on a Saturday night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frisco-5,2.24,2.24,2.24,2.284,2.24

The waiters I've had have always been amazing and the food is just about what you would expect from a Chili's chain. Although I, and as it seems a lot of people, have always had problems with the hostesses. They do not greet people. They don't smile. They do not communicate with each other leading to one group being sat immediately after another is told there would be a five minute wait. Overall they don't seem interested in doing their job effectively, or about the customer. Now on my last visit I decided to respectfully tell a manager about what I though because overall I do love Chili's as I have been coming for such a long time and I want them to do well. Coincidentally the manager that came over to the table was brand new and I felt like I might be overwhelming him, but I went ahead anyway, and it  turns out that he is a ""Culture manager"" that has been brought in for this exact reason. I told him my concerns and praised the waiters and the rest of the staff and I felt resolved. Upon returning a couple weeks later I thought there had been some but not a total improvement and I saw that manager working his butt off whipping these guys into shape.

Immediately gave him our order and got cold fried pickles and our dinner at the same time. He didn't come check on us, instead his trainee (which is the most horrifying part is he is training someone) came to check on us.

Bad choice on our part!   Got right to the table and was greeted by the waiter so things were looking good. But it soon went down hill after that. We ordered Chips and Salsa, two waters, and a Shiner. Got the water quickly and then about 5 minutes later got the chips and salsa. I was about half way through my water when I finally got my beer. At that point we ordered our dinners.  While waiting on the food we finished off the salsa and while he was flying by he told us he would bring out a new salsa. I tried to get him to ask for more chips because most of the chips in the basket were small broken pieces. It was probably about 10 minutes before he showed up with the salsa and by that time we had already eaten all the chip pieces and my wife was out of water, and had been for a while. When he showed up with the salsa he said ""Oh... I'll get more chips and you some water.""  It was about 5 minutes later and he showed up with the chips and water.  We were just about finished with the second serving of chips and salsa when we finally had the manager sent over. It had been 45 minutes since we ordered our food.  (Not since we had gotten there... since we had ordered.) He called on his radio to the back to ask about our food and told us that it would be out in about 45 seconds. It did arrive around that time and it tasted good... but it was not hot, it was just a bit warm. I did not want to send it back for fear of it taking another 45 minutes to get it back.  The table next to us had left and it sat dirty for over a half hour. All in all there were three tables in the bar area that sat dirty for over half an hour and a pile of people waiting at the door for a table. I pointed that out to the manager and he started to clean them. Once he got the tables cleaned he was not to be seen in the bar again. I ended up having to take most of my food home because after eating so much of the chips and salsa while waiting so long I got full. It took them 45 minutes to get us our food from the time we ordered it and we ended up being there for around an hour and forty minutes. That is way too long and not turning over tables has got to be eating into their profits. However, in looking at other reviews on here that may be the norm for this location.

I had to flag down the hostess to find my server to see if my order was lost. All of this can  be served quickly from a warming table in the kitchen. The food was OK but by the time I was served I was not pleased. Brinker International, the parent company, just laid off 80 people here in the Dallas area due to slumping sales at Chili's.

That's the craving I was having and started searching out restaurants for chicken and waffles. My last experience at a different restaurant kind of ruined my taste buds for chicken and waffles and I was determined to find a restaurant that would help me get back to my happy place. I know, Chilli's isnt' the first place I thought of either but after a friend recommend I check them out to satisfy my craving I headed over to my local spot in Frisco. I can honestly say I haven't been to Chili's in awhile and really only thought of them as an average restaurant. I will say I was surprised when I walked in the place seemed a little different, they have upgraded some of the interior décor and have put more effort into being a clean & welcoming restaurant when you first walk in. We sat down and our waiter (waiter was awesome .. great customer service always on top of everything..)   stopped by rather quickly which is always good. He took our drink order, water, Dr Pepper and I wanted to try the ""Coconut State of Mind"" since it sounded really good from the description. As we looked over the menus we started to see a wide range of new meals and enticing food pictures. If I wasn't on a mission for the Chicken and Waffles I think I would have been there for a good 15 mins just trying to decide what I wanted to eat as it all sounded really good. We ordered the Honey-Chipotle Crispers & Waffles with fries on the side and a Grass-Fed Sunrise Burger with fries. Yep, you read that right, Chili's now offers grass fed beef and cage free eggs. Amazing! If you haven't tried a grass fed burger then you are definitely missing out. The flavors are enhanced and the burger is really moist, just a perfect burger. Our drinks were delivered quickly and as I took my first sip I was instantly transported to a beautiful beach on a tropical island, delicious. In fact it was so delicious and enjoyable I had to order another Coconut State of Mind. Our food arrived after the appropriate amount of time for them to cook everything fresh and here's where Chili's has gone to the next step, everything they put in front of us looked exactly like the menu picture, exactly! I can't remember how many places I've gone to that show you a delicious looking food item on the menu and you order it thinking you are going to really enjoy your meal and when it arrives to your table you have instead received either a shrunken version of what you ordered or something that looks like the cook was playing grill hockey with your food and you end up with a jumbled mess. Chili's gets bonus points for presentation!! On to how the food tastes. My first bite was a mixture of crispy chicken, Belgian waffle, honey-chipotle sauce and a little bit of syrup. Absolutely Amazing!! So delicious having the moist crispy chicken with the perfectly cooked Belgian waffle, drizzled honey-chipotle sauce and to top it all off being able to dunk all of it into a side of syrup!! My mouth just went on a roller coaster ride and doesn't want to get off. The Grass-Fed Sunrise Burger was just as amazing!! The beef was seasoned perfectly and the burger was juicy, delicious and the cage-free egg was just runny enough to give you that little bit of yolk flavoring that makes your mouth happy. I really enjoyed this visit to Chili's and have put them on my list of favorite restaurants. They are no longer just an average restaurant, they have moved up to the ""recommended list"". Great Job Chili's!! I'll be back to try more items from the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frisco-5,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
10,Kevin P.,"Prosper, TX",10,7,,3.0,2017-07-26,"Slowest service ever.  When we arrived at 4:30pm, there may have been three other groups of patrons.  Had to ask twice if our meal would be coming out soon.  When a manager finally brought out our meal, I mentioned that it took awhile and all he said was that the cook did it wrong.  They substituted a Mexican rice for the rice that was supposed to be with the meal and it tasted terrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frisco-5,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
17,Amir F.,"Carrollton, TX",1,19,,1.0,2017-07-29,Total joke.  We went and were seated and no one bothered to come serve us after 15 minutes.  Called the hostess over and let her know and asked if they were busy she said i and then she proceeded to call someone to sober could get served.  Another 10 minutes passed and nothing.  There were servers (I'm assuming that is what these employees were) just talking to each other not busy at all.  We walked out and that same hostess just kind of said sorry about that like she was reading a script.  There was also a manager who saw all of this happen.  What a joker though seriously.  It may not always be like that but this is a no brainer one star experience no questions asked.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frisco-5,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44

I ordered Cajun Chicken Pasta and ordered corn on the side and omg, it was a happy fulfilling meal!! I first finished the corn because it was just so good but therefore, couldn't finish all of the pasta because I was full haha. But even with the full stomach, I must say the pasta was very good!!  After tipping the waitress, the price was about $20, however I think it was worth the money!!! Would definitely go there again, maybe after a paycheck day or someone's birthday to treat yourself!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frisco-5,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56

12,Tom S.,"Allen, TX",0,40,3.0,1.0,2017-10-13,"Never ever again. My wife and I went here for dinner tonight. We arrived before the crowd  but had to wait for the crew to bus a table for us. I ordered a bowl of chili and my wife ordered a hamburger. We waited and waited. On top of that there was a couple sitting next to us with two kids. Their son was screaming and jumping around on the bench seating and kept kicking my wife. The mother was playing with him, dancing on the seat to the restaurant music. We told the waitress we were tried of the long wait for our meal and the misbehaving kids and we were leaving to bring us a check. The waitress said she understood and told us we did not owe anything. The kids were no fault of Chili's - Parents be be consider of others that may not enjoy your kids acting like they have no sense when you go out. Leave them home if they do not have the manners to be in a public restaurant. Chili's,  we will not be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frisco-5,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
0,LouAnn T.,"Little Elm, TX",60,36,11.0,3.0,2017-11-03,"We've been here several times, although this is the first review. It's my son's favorite place for chicken strips, and the presidente margarita is pretty good, and only $5 during happy hour.  The skillet queso is decent and we love that they refill the chips & salsa. Makes for a budget-friendly appetizer.   The service is friendly and they're good about refills and clearing plates.  Food is pretty decent, and they have a great variety for families. Plus the prices are good.  4 stars for overall predictable food and service.  CON: The biggest turn-off is every single time we are here the menus are dirty. Like, dried-on salsa dirty.   One star off for that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frisco-5,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
4,Clinton F.,"Heather Ridge Estates, Frisco, TX",0,1,1.0,1.0,2017-12-16,"Chicken and waffles as a seated guest with paid staff - 5 Stars Curbside pickup of to-go orders...1 Star 1. Staff dont actually do curbside 2. Staff add 30+ minutes to orders to make sure everything is served cold 3. Staff get their tips first and then resist showing you your orders, knowing they are going to expose the lack of sides and the poor quality.  4. Staff effectively tell you to ""pound sand"" once they have your money, if you question the quality and quantity of the order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frisco-5,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
5,Brad S.,"Frisco, TX",0,3,,1.0,2017-12-29,Very disorganized the minute they took our names. They took my name down wrong and we waited an extra 10 minutes until we went back up and asked them. Once we were seated no one waited on us for 20 minutes we sat there until we grabbed someone. They were busy but not really busy. Either understaffed or people that don't really care.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frisco-5,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
3,Nicole G.,"Little Elm, TX",138,6,,1.0,2018-01-03,"It seems like every time we order at this chilis to go something is left off our order (or is cold) and not once have we received any money back, just get let us know next time and we will get it for you free.  Problem is when you try to order they have nothing documented and just say they are sorry.  So tired of the customer service and lack of quality.  Also the last 3 times we have ordered curbside not once have they brought the order to the car we have had to go in the store.  Chilis seriously needs to consider new management at this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-frisco-5,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
