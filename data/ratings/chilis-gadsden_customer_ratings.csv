1,Deborah H.,"Leesburg, AL",0,11,,5.0,2012-04-13,I eat here at least one a month for lunch.  Food is always good and the service is great- some of the nicest people I've met.  All chain restaurants vary according to location but this one shines.  Love the California club.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gadsden?start=20,,,,,
22,Margaret D.,"Palm Bay, FL",0,8,1.0,1.0,2013-01-07,"Service was slow and bad, food was cold and took forever to get to the table.  It tasted like it had been sitting in the kitchen for hours.  My sister had a salad that she said was good.  And my cousin had soup that was hot and good.   The place was not busy so the service should have been better.  I told the server that the food was not good and it was cold.  I never saw a manager, so I assume that they did not care.   We will not go back to his Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gadsden,,,,,
21,Brian C.,"Birmingham, AL",115,387,148.0,4.0,2014-03-19,This Chili's is actually pretty cool as chain places go.  It's right on the water so some tables have got a really nice view.  The service and food is what you'd expect.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gadsden,,,,,
23,Alex D.,"Sylacauga, AL",5,15,5.0,5.0,2014-05-08,"This Chili's was really good! The good was all very fresh and hot, and the service was quick and friendly. The interior and exterior all looked very modern and up to date. Loved the color scheme.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gadsden,,,,,
18,Police Lives Matter ..,"Greenville, SC",0,187,17.0,3.0,2014-05-20,"The chicken tacos were just ""ok"", nothing great for $9.95. A small amount of chicken and tons of lettuce. Service at the bar was average.  I hope Chili's is not becoming another ""Applebee's"" where food has gone downhill lately.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gadsden,,,,,
17,Ingrid H.,"Bowling Green, KY",13,219,152.0,4.0,2014-06-16,"What can I say.. this is a chain.. food is consistent. What I can add was staff was attentive and friendly. I sat at bar as I was dining alone and bartender was great. Unlike some chili's this one has a great outside sitting area that over looks the river, so very nice. I had an enchilada salad and watermelon cooler both were good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gadsden,,,,,
2,Greg S.,"Anniston, AL",0,2,,3.0,2014-07-14,"Okay just a few things-the enchiladas I had were very good. The service was very good. However you guys need to wipe off your menus so they're not sticky, that leaves a bad impression that you're not keeping things clean. Make sure customers have silverware before their food is brought out. And to the corporate folks out there listening try to get a selection of beer that isn't all mainstream, Add a micro beer or two.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gadsden?start=20,,,,,
20,Tina E.,"Atlanta, GA",23,26,40.0,3.0,2014-10-08,"This was my second visit to this Chili's location & I must say I was really disappointed.  We were seated outside on the patio, which is a beautiful area. The patio is a gorgeous place to eat, with a beautiful pond, fountain, and lake to enjoy. Our waitress was new to working at Chili's, but not new to serving. She did not take our order for at least 15 minutes after being seated. She did not keep our water glasses even remotely full, not adding ice when she did get around to refilling them. It took at least 15 minutes for one member of our party to get a beer. I must compliment our server on the table side guacamole preparation. She was very well trained in that menu item. I have ordered the slider burgers with the black bean patty many different times at other Chili's location,  but we were told that they could not make it for us at this location. We had to explain how to make them to the server so that she could explain it to the kitchen staff. When our check arruved, we had to ask for a pen. It took another 15 minutes for the server to pick up our check. Overall, not a good experience for a restaurant that I normally enjoy. Possibly due to inexperienced server, but as there were few patrons in the restaurant, more attention to detail could have been given.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gadsden,,,,,
3,Austin J.,"Anniston, AL",2,15,2.0,1.0,2014-11-01,"It has been a few weeks since I ate here, but I remember the service and food.  The environment was nice, but wait staff is almost none in existence.  They had around 15 wait staff on duty, but my 1st one was too busy in the back eating and completely ignored me.  I received my drink (sweet tea) 30 minutes later, 10 minutes after I requested to be moved.  At this time, my waiter noticed I was departing his area and came following.  The food was barely edible, but I insisted on attempting to revive my stop by ordering dessert.  I ordered cheesecake with ""homemade"" strawberry purée.  Before ordering, I asked the staff about the ingredients in the purée, and I was informed they haven't the slightest clue, but knew it had strawberries in it.  When it arrived, I tasted the purée first, and it tasted as if it had alcohol in it.  I once again asked my waitresses to let me know what's in the purée or find out from cooks/""chef"".  Upon one of their arrivals, they informed me the ""chef"" did not know, but he knew it had strawberries in it.  I then asked the most important question: ""how is the purée homemade if even the kitchen staff don't know!""  My waitress went and got the manager, before he arrived, he must have checked for himself about the ""fresh homemade"" purée.  He arrives to inform me, the bag of frozen purée says strawberries in water.  I asked if they add anything, he said no, they de-thaw the bag and serve it.  I then told him, ""just because u melt a bag of frozen strawberries doesn't make it homemade"" then I informed him to take the dessert and remove it from my bill, as I had only tasted the purée and didn't trust they're competence in knowing what they serve/prepare.  This place is beautifully placed, but lacks the ability to properly function as a viable business to dine at...drive by it and enjoy the scenery, if you stop, it'll ruin the beautiful scenery that surrounds it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gadsden?start=20,,,,,
0,Logan D.,"Murrells Inlet, SC",2,1,,5.0,2015-01-11,Awesome place! The 2 for $20 deal is amazing! The steak there is out of this world! - alien maybe,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gadsden?start=20,,,,,
15,Harley C.,"Centre, AL",2,8,1.0,3.0,2015-03-02,"This restaurant is becoming just like Applebee's... unpredictable.  One night, I ordered the mango chili tilapia (maybe I got the name right) and the tilapia was WAY overcooked and the mangoes were ROTTEN! In my first bite, I knew something was wrong. Thankfully, our waiter was a godsend and he took it off our check and offered something else. Every time we have been impressed with the service.  My mom and I went for lunch and she just ordered the egg roll appetizer, which is delicious! I ordered the flat bread pizza and it was out of this world. Hopefully, my next meal there will be as good as my previous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gadsden,,,,,
14,Karly D.,"Wellington, AL",0,1,1.0,1.0,2015-06-18,I don't have high expectations for Chili's but this experience was an all time low for me. When i went to the To Go counter I could barely even give my name to the guy at the register because a lady in the back was shouting so loudly and rudely to the cooks in the back. It was incredibly unprofessional. That was bad. When I got the order home it was even worse.I got an order of the mini burgers and when I go them home and started eating one of them was still cool and raw. Disgusting!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gadsden,,,,,
19,Colby M.,"Gadsden, AL",28,8,,1.0,2016-05-08,"This is the only 1 star review I've written so far, but I think this location of Chili's deserves it. I like Chili's food typically but this location is just terrible. I've been several times and most of the staff isn't friendly or attentive. The last time I went we ordered an appetizer and we got it the same time as the entrees so that was kinda pointless. I honestly don't know how they're still in business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gadsden,,,,,
16,Kelley W.,"Huntsville, AL",0,5,,1.0,2016-07-16,"We just got up and left. We were seated and blatantly ignored by the two servers in the section. Finally, someone came by and took our drink order. He actually said ""I'll go ahead and get your drink orders. I don't know if I'll be your server."" After that, I told my husband I felt like we would just have crappy service the entire time. So we just left. The place wasn't busy at all! I would understand if it was. The employees just had absolutely no clue what was going on. This isn't the first time I've experienced clueless employees at this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gadsden,,,,,
11,Jd R.,"Gadsden, AL",4,65,,1.0,2016-07-22,This is literally the worst Chili's restaurant.  The food is awful and disgusting.  I gave this place a chance after going to another location and having some wonderful pork tacos.  Came here and ordered the same dish and it was not fit to eat.  Will not return.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gadsden,,,,,
13,Karen R.,"Gadsden, AL",10,11,,1.0,2016-08-06,When this chili's opened it was great. Now the food is cold or not what you ordered. The service is really bad.  Management DOES not act like they care. When something is said it's like you are at fault.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gadsden,,,,,
5,Jeremy T.,"Huntsville, AL",57,162,7.0,4.0,2016-11-19,I came here back in the summer time on a date. I have never really been a big fan of Chili's from prior visits but we made it happen.  I will say I do love the location being right on the river. I did think that was pretty cool. Me and my date ordered a order of fried white cheddar balls that were okay but tasted just like Zaxby's if you want my opinion but double the cost. She ordered some sort of promotional quesadilla that I am sure they no longer have and I got a burger lol. The food was okay. The server did not get several of my request right which kinda made me mad. Overall it was okay and I would not mind coming back only because of the location but driving 2 hours from Huntsville would not make it worth it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gadsden,,,,,
6,Tisha H.,"Gadsden, AL",0,3,,1.0,2016-12-30,"Now I live in the area and have eaten at this particular Chili's on a few occasions in the past. I guess I had forgotten on why I didn't go there more often. Now I am reminded and will not make the same mistake. On a scale of 1-10 I would rate the food at this Chili's as a solid ""3"". I had ordered a ribeye, med-rare and it arrived med-well and was one of the toughest steaks I have ever eaten. The grade of the steak lacked any sort of marbeling and was dry and was even a bit of a challenge to cut with a knife.  The cheese mashed potatoes were really sad, it is as if they were left on a warmer tray for a quick reheat before sending the food out of the kitchen. The high point of the meal was the dessert (the berry cake). It was ""OK"" or maybe by that time I was really getting a bit desperate to find something worthwhile out of the meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gadsden,,,,,
9,Kristopher S.,"Lilburn, GA",128,6,1.0,5.0,2017-01-30,"I stay overnight in Gadsden weekly and of all the restaurants available in the area, I choose to dine at Chilis the most. Because I am on business, I usually sit at the bar and dine. I have always had a pleasant experience with both bartenders. Both are very knowledgeable about the menu have  great attitudes. When in Gadsden, definitely stop by and unwind! These two will make you feel right at home!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gadsden,,,,,
8,Patrick H.,"Gadsden, AL",25,39,65.0,1.0,2017-03-06,Bad all the way around. Go to the hospital across the street and it will be better. A disaster of a restaurant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gadsden,,,,,
10,TYLER C.,"Rainbow City, AL",5,6,,1.0,2017-03-27,"This place has gone so far downhill that I don't know if it's salvageable. I hoped after the last time, which was terrible as well, that maybe it was a busy night, or a one time thing but tonight was awful. The girl who helped me at the to go register, Clara, was wonderful but she was the only positive part of this whole experience. But the kitchen staff need to either learn what they're doing, or get out, and if the manager won't take the reins then he or she can go with them. I ordered to go, waited the 30 minutes to pick my order up only to be told they were out of part of my order but could have more in 25 minutes. Bear in mind I placed this order 30 minutes before. I got the order home, my wife's salad was left out entirely, and my burger was so raw it was still telling me to ""eat more chikin"". This place either needs new management or to get out of the way where we can have some decent dining options again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gadsden,,,,,
12,Chad H.,"Bryson City, NC",32,5,,2.0,2017-05-06,I tried ordering fried pickles but they were out. Then I thought about ordering there cheese sticks but they were out. My friend tried to get mac and cheese but they were out. Several things listed on the menu is not available!!! I won't be back. Fixing to be another Gander Mtn in this town if they don't get there act straight!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gadsden,,,,,
7,Gavin H.,"Gadsden, AL",0,8,,1.0,2017-05-14,"Have never had a pleasant meal here but I do try to give restaurants chances. Went today on Mother's Day and must say they didn't let me down. Not that great staff and below bland food. Thought if I just get a smaller steak instead the big ribeye I usually get, they would cook it right, nope. They just don't know what they're doing",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gadsden,,,,,
4,Phyllis E.,"Gadsden, AL",6,3,1.0,3.0,2017-10-03,"We were there 45 minutes before the waitress took our order. Salads came fairly quickly so that tied me over till we finally got our food. I ordered the two taco's it came with really good hot french fry's. The stuff inside the taco's was pretty good. (no avocado on it as picture displays) but it's on a flour tortilla and the filling was pretty wet so the tortilla got soggy quick. I ate it, shucks I was very hungry at this point. We were in the restaurant a hour before we got any food. Best part of the meal was the company I was with and being outside and the view of the river. The weather was perfect!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gadsden,,,,,
