16,Joey P.,"Dahlonega, GA",0,4,,1.0,2013-10-27,Just went by to get their awesome chocolate molten lava cake but I got there one whole side of was completely empty and I was told it would be 25 minutes. Sorry no one was waiting and I wasn't either,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gainesville-4,,,,,
14,A D.,"Orlando, FL",0,132,3.0,3.0,2015-01-19,It's a decent location for a chain restaurant.  I ordered the shrimp tex mex bowl and it was good.  Customer service is a little slow but friendly.  Plenty of parking on the side and in the back of the restaurant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gainesville-4,,,,,
10,Peppermint L.,"Shenandoah, VA",17,133,54.0,4.0,2015-09-23,"I've been in here to eat a few times and have also ordered Chili's To Go. Their food is always very hot and flavorful and the portions are pretty large too. Every time I go here, the servers are always friendly and offer us refills. I usually get the Honey Chipotle Chicken Crispers or the Cajun Pasta. Both are good!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gainesville-4,,,,,
12,Janel M.,"Flowery Branch, GA",0,15,,1.0,2015-11-07,"Standing here over 30 minutes, entire restaurant is empty, and they won't seat anyone because ""their systems are down."" A party of 18 ""called ahead"" and they are saying all menus are being used. Absolutely unacceptable!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gainesville-4,,,,,
9,Jasmine H.,"Gainesville, GA",4,42,52.0,3.0,2015-12-19,"Only wanted 10 minutes on a Saturday night to be seated. Service was good, my food was so-so. I ordered the buffalo ranch chicken sandwich, which came out dry- almost as if it wasn't cooked to order. I enjoyed the corn on the cob. My boyfriend has the fajita skilled and it was 100x better than mine. It was sizzling with pico, sour cream, guacamole, tortillas and cheese on the side. We basically split his meal. Funny thing is, I was at the Hamilton Mill Chili's last weekend and the food was fabulous! I would come back because the service was good but would choose a different entree.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gainesville-4,,,,,
13,Deborah G.,"Blairsville, GA",0,1,,1.0,2016-03-06,"I stoped to grab a quick take out. I have never been to this Chili's. I told the hostess I wanted to make a to go order she said I could go to the bar or ""around there"" I waited at bar finally had the bartender tell me I could go around the cornner to do that. Finally made my way to the specific to go area. The woman taking the order was very overwhelmed with my order. Ordered the loaded boneless chicken wings and combo appitizer. The chicken wings were so over cooked I could not eat them. The cheddar bites were nasty. The southwest egg rolls were okay as were the chicken crispers. I have been staying at the hospital with a sick family member. I just wanted a good meal. This was terrible.  I won't be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gainesville-4,,,,,
8,Natalie W.,"Alto, GA",9,155,160.0,4.0,2016-05-22,We walked in at 6pm on a Sunday. Were seated right away inside the bar. Quick & efficient service; they were even able to customize my Fresh Bowl for my vegetarian needs. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because I except great service from a chain restaurant with an established reputation.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gainesville-4,,,,,
11,Philip E.,"Gainesville, GA",0,23,,2.0,2016-12-23,"Went to chili's last night to try it after avoiding it for about 2 years. The menu has changed to even more generic choices and  it was hard to find anything that seemed tasty. We started with the white queso dip in a skillet. When we got it the cheese was not melted and our chips would not penetrate the outer membrane of the cheese. The chips were good...that got them 2 stars...we ordered mini burgers, boneless wings and southwestern egg rolls. The food was so generic that it really had no taste at all. To beat everything it was 34 bucks. This place needs an identity...it didn't taste bad...it just didn't taste at all",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gainesville-4,,,,,
7,Jessica G.,"Cumming, GA",4,13,52.0,1.0,2017-02-22,"Worst service I've had in a while. Half way thru meal before drinks arrived. Was told they were out of margarita shakers. Funny bc table who was seated after us got their drinks first and they ordered same drinks. Had to get the host to bring napkins and flatware. After waiting for main meal, got raw chicken. Raw!! Saw server 1 time the entire evening. If I could give 0 stars I would",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gainesville-4,,,,,
6,Melissa R.,"Braselton, GA",6,44,47.0,1.0,2017-02-25,"Absolutely not! HORRIBLE hostess situation. They DID NOT call our name, and did not text, but they took our name off the wait list stating they did. We were sitting in the waiting area! The LYING pissed me off. Then she sat me before I had a moment to grab husbands attention at the 2 top by the kitchen (where we overheard all kinds of snotty wait staff comments) when there was another 2 top away from the kitchen. The staff was not attentive or kind, didn't even pretend to be kind. They were PISSED to be busy. A waiter CHEWED on a pen he placed on my ticket to use and sign, and did not wipe a sauce bottle after dropping on the very DIRTY floor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gainesville-4,,,,,
5,Laura L.,"Gainesville, GA",19,12,,1.0,2017-03-26,"This is one of the worst service & food. We were there yesterday food was cold, no good, etc.etc.etc.  We have to ask for silverware and napkins and refills.  They brought my husband the wrong order. I don't think we are coming back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gainesville-4,,,,,
4,Lynn F.,"Flowery Branch, GA",375,20,30.0,4.0,2017-06-03,Kevin our server was simply amazing. He was attentive and very helpful. Ask for him!.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gainesville-4,,,,,
3,Mary M.,"Gainesville, GA",0,29,9.0,4.0,2017-06-11,The buffalo chicken sandwich is delish paired with my favorite kettle black beans! Never a bad meal here. Dawn in the bar area is so great! Always a pleasure to go there and see her beautiful friendly smile!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gainesville-4,,,,,
2,McKenna A.,"Dawsonville, GA",0,7,,4.0,2017-07-25,"I had a good experience at this restaurant. The service was friendly to us, the entrees came out quickly and were hot and prepared correctly. My only complaint would be that the first set of chips in the chips and salsa they gave us were cold.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gainesville-4,,,,,
1,Jordan S.,"Gainesville, GA",16,1,,1.0,2017-12-03,"My party waited an hour while there were several tables open that just needed to be cleaned.  My Skillet queso dip was cold and the salsa was hot, Ribs were dry and tasted old, Fried pickles were soggy, rice was cold and undercooked. Service was subpar. I will never eat at this Chili's again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gainesville-4,,,,,
0,Edward J.,"Alpharetta, GA",10,3,10.0,3.0,2017-12-19,Good food and service.  Server forgot my utensils but she was new as I was told. Nothing more to say but a typical Chilis  like most I visited. Only place to eat in town that I like to sit at bar and not be bothered.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gainesville-4,,,,,
