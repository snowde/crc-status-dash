16,Shannon L.,"Gallatin, TN",5,22,,1.0,2012-02-04,"I brought my kids to lunch today at this Chili's. Our waiter was high on some kind of substance, he was very rude (told my son to ""stop drinking like a fish"") cause he had to bring him refills, got our order wrong...and worst yet, there didn't appear to be anyone ""in charge"" to talk to about the situation. I was very unhappy and I don't think we'll be going back, or recommending it to other friends.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gallatin,,,,,
15,Wendy S.,"Hendersonville, TN",20,2,1.0,1.0,2013-05-04,"""Service was terrible, food was wrong and chips were greasy. The past two times the food and service was below average. We will not be back to the Gallatin location.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gallatin,,,,,
10,Jennifer R.,"Mt Juliet, TN",47,3,1.0,1.0,2013-10-26,"It has been a while since we have eaten at this location and now I remember why. They like to say they 'team serve' you, but what they really mean is no one serves you. Every time we have been to this location there is a problem. Always poor service. The manager is unfamiliar with how Foursquare check in specials work and basically accused me of checking in twice (how?) to earn my 3rd visit free dessert.  In addition, this visit my burger was overcooked (I asked for medium, it was medium well) and found a hair in my fries.  Lastly, I planned to order the chocolate peanut butter molten lava cake, then the waitress informed me she was allergic to peanuts so I would have to pay BEFORE I ate dessert! This is not how I would expect this to be handled.  Please save yourself time and money and drive on by this location. Go the Hendersonville location instead!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gallatin,,,,,
14,Melissa B.,"Gallatin, TN",27,32,,1.0,2013-12-22,"Don't waste your time or money at this location.  The past two visits we were completely forgotten about.  Our waitress never apologized, and acted as if everything was completely normal.  By the time we were served our food, we had sat there over an hour. It was not busy.  It was Sunday at 2:30 in the afternoon.  There were maybe five tables (if that) when we arrived.  We are patient people, but twice in a row and it's time to find a new family favorite.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gallatin,,,,,
12,randy s.,"Lexington, NC",33,34,8.0,1.0,2015-01-21,this location is one of the worst I ever been in. I have had nothing but the worst service in chilis.. I told the girl about all my bad experiences and she promised there wouldn't be any issues and right from the get go.. food was way to long to come out at a time when it wasn't crowded. and the worst where you pay at the table the had to machines then come to tell us we swiped wrong machine.. the place was dirty and no one seemed to care,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gallatin,,,,,
13,Kristy S.,"San Diego, CA",7,37,17.0,2.0,2015-02-15,"I love Chili's,  but this location needs work. Our last two visits were a joke, we ordered two simple dinner items and after two hours..we still didn't have our food, it took 20 min to even get someone to take our drink order. They did comp us our meal, so I didn't give it one star. our waitress had the nerve to try and bill us the full amount.. Not sure of we will be back. .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gallatin,,,,,
11,James D.,"Gallatin, TN",0,9,8.0,2.0,2015-07-27,Ordered Margarita chicken and cheese fries. Fries showed up hot and fresh. The chicken was cold and had a hair on it. Manager did stop by to make things better and took entree off the bill for my wife and me.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gallatin,,,,,
8,Jeff C.,"Gallatin, TN",349,90,64.0,4.0,2015-08-31,"I visited here twice recently for the first time visiting a Chili's in nearly 10 years.  Both occasions were pleasant.  I had their smothered prime rib burrito the first time and one of their combination of two meat platters the second time.  The environment is what you'd expect, the service adequate, and the prices well within the mainstream.  I'm not a big fan of these chain places, but my experiences here have been positive on both occasions.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gallatin,,,,,
9,Josh K.,"Asheville, NC",1,2,,1.0,2015-11-22,No door to the kitchen from the dining room.  We hear everything EVERYTHING!  Not a big enough tip?  Unhappy customer?  Yeah we can hear you complain out here.  Our server is using the booth behind us as daycare.  She forgot my order and never brought chip refills or drink refills.  When you are talking to customers stay at the table.  It's very annoying shouting our drink order three tables away.  The food itself tasted like reheated lean cuisine meals.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gallatin,,,,,
5,Brian A.,"Hermitage, TN",8,13,,1.0,2015-12-09,"My wife and I have dined at this location a few times as it is close to home, but each time was a terrible experience.  Very disappointing.  The food was undercooked and the staff didn't seem to care. I ordered the cajun chicken pasta and the chicken was cold, almost still frozen. Went back a few weeks later, got the steak faitas and the steak was barely cooked. This time, I politely notified the waitress. She didn't apologize, took my plate away and brought back in the same way, still very undercooked. I didn't touch it. She stopped back over, looked at my plate of untouched food and didn't ask any questions.   I have no idea how this location is still in business.  -Brian",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gallatin,,,,,
6,J S.,"Gallatin, TN",0,25,1.0,4.0,2016-05-18,"My husband and I visit this Chili's fairly frequently. We've had very few server issues and the food is consistently tasty. We both order the quesadilla explosion salad and it always pleases. The fajitas are pretty yummy as well. Although it's a chain, this Chili's is still worth your visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gallatin,,,,,
7,Kristin L.,"Gallatin, TN",5,3,1.0,2.0,2016-06-18,We have ate here twice and both times the service was terrible. The first time we were forgot about while our waiter watched tv in the bar. The second time no drink refills and had to wait forever for check. Both times they were not very busy so there is no excuse for that. We will not be going back. Food was decent.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gallatin,,,,,
2,Jay H.,"Gallatin, TN",0,7,,1.0,2016-12-23,Terrible... Just left there.   We stood for 15 minutes and no one ever even bothered to come out. They must be short staffed since all the empty tables were full of dirty dishes in need of bussing. We gave up and left. It was not worth the effort!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gallatin,,,,,
1,Larry S.,"Hendersonville, TN",139,428,121.0,2.0,2017-05-05,"I really wanted to give this Chili's a higher rating, because it really was a mixed bag of good and bad.  Unlike many other reviewers, we had no problems with the service.  Our waitress was friendly, helpful, and efficient.  And our Southwest Eggroll appetizer was great.  But they always are. Then we got the drinks.  The Margaritas were very good, but my wife's Cosmopolitan was not well made at all.  She thinks it had way too much Triple-Sec, but she didn't like it.  And as I've mentioned before, she tends to judge a restaurant by its Cosmos. We went to Chili's because I was in the mood for Fajitas.  I had the Chicken/Carnitas combo, and they were very, very good.  I love the way it looks, the sound of the sizzle, and the aroma coming off the pan.  But I was the only one happy with my dinner.  My wife's tacos were stone cold by the time she got them.  My son's steak was very underdone for him.  I like a very rare stake, but he's more civilized than I am.  My daughter was very disappointed with her Margherita Flatbread.  It was downright soggy.  Seriously, why would they do that?  She is a vegetarian, and Chili's does not have many vegetarian-friendly menu items.  The Margherita Flatbread has always been her go-to at Chili's, and this experience may just guarantee that we'll never be back.   And I will sure miss those fajitas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gallatin,,,,,
4,Victor N.,"San Diego, CA",0,4,,1.0,2017-07-23,"When I ordered a burger I informed the waiter I had a food allergy to mayo. My burger came with their special sauce, which has mayo in it. I returned the food and expected them to replace the burger. The waiter brought the same burger back to me and said there was no mayo on it. Two people at my table tasted the burger and agreed--there was mayo on that burger. The manager came over and said there was no mayo. I'm not accustomed to being called a liar.  I could have ended up in the hospital over that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gallatin,,,,,
3,Kelly C.,"Westmoreland, TN",0,9,,1.0,2017-09-22,"I will never do business with this Chilis again, this was a Thursday night and took over 45 minutes to get a burger, a house salad, and a flatbread pizza, when the burger was brought out, the burger was raw for my friend who took a bite of her burger and her face was horrid to realize the burger on the inside was completely raw, my husband to go order of a burger came out15 minutes later, open his burger and cut the meat, the same raw, called the manager, Adam and during our conversation about the food being undercook and he called me a liar, I was livid. Told my friend yeah, I knew about your burger being raw but never came out to acknowledge it or to apologize. He states that my burger was cooked, now pink raw meat is pink raw meat, that is nowhere med. well. I told after that he can take back the burger I am no longer interested of purchasing food from Chilis",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gallatin,,,,,
0,D. H.,"Hendersonville, TN",17,258,192.0,3.0,2017-11-01,"My review is actually closer to a 3.5 as I had no real issues with my meal or the service. It was a totally adequate lunch stop. I primarily opted for Chili's because the parking lot didn't look overpacked and the ads for their new burger menu looked pretty good.  I think I remembered the ad a tad incorrectly as I thought the burgers were in the $6.95 range for lunch. They're actually closer to 10 and 11 bucks though you can get a basic ""old timer"" (w/ or w/o cheese) for 8.50 or so. I opted for that which was served with fries on a platter. The burger was pretty good---the toppings were fresh, the thick cut pickles delicious, the beef juicy, the cheese tasty and the bun toasted and not soggy. The beef is a tad on the greasy side as each bit left a trail of grease on my chin but it was tasty. The fries were not bad but lacked something (crispiness, spice). Service was friendly and fast, I was in and out for lunch in less than 35 minutes for less than 10 bucks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-gallatin,,,,,
