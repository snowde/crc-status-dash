29,Robin B.,"Memphis, TN",337,309,1976.0,4.0,2012-11-18,"On a weeknight, this is a very efficient family restaurant with some healthy choices among all of the golden-brown fatty foods.  My kids love this as a last-minute post-karate dinner stop, and I love the Chilis-to-Go option, where you can call ahead, and park in a special spot, and run in to pick up your food at a separate register designated for to-go orders.  On the weekdays, food is consistent, the happy hour is booming (two for one house wines, draft beers, and well drinks).  It's a great spot to sit in the bar and enjoy a game, or just escape with a friend for an hour or two. On the weekends, service here, like the food, is touch-and-go.  Great two for one happy hours daily.  It gets busy and fills up quickly, you will wait if you arrive after 7:00pm.  Recommend getting on the email list at  , to receive coupon codes for free desserts, kids' meals, and queso dip each week.   The updates to this restaurant made recently are fine, it just seems more corporate now than it did before, with a bit less personality.  It is clean, and no longer has that fishy smell by the front door (did anyone else used to notice that?).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-germantown-4?start=20,2.544,2.544,2.544,2.544,2.544

Service was pretty good from a bunch of young pretty women. After lunch when I looked up my calorie count, I was surprised about the calorie count. Look it up before you order, too many calories for me for lunch. Next time I'll try one of their salads.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-germantown-4?start=20,2.38,2.38,2.38,2.38,2.38
38,Jenny P.,"Memphis, TN",0,1,,5.0,2013-03-05,"The Chili's in Germantown has always provided the best service in the area. My boyfriend and I went together and were impressed from start to finish. Our servers were partners, making it very easy to get what we needed for our meal. We got refills on chips and drinks without having to ask, our food came out fresh and made correctly, and we received the check in a timely manner. Also, our server made sure we got the most for our money by giving us to go cups and to go bags for our leftover items. We don't live close to this location, but we always make the drive for this impeccable service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-germantown-4?start=20,2.516,2.516,2.516,2.516,2.516
35,Katie D.,"Austin, TX",69,282,5.0,2.0,2013-04-24,"This location is hit or miss. It's really bad at lunchtime. The staff always seem underprepared to deal with the rush. It's East Memphis, guys. Did you really think it wasn't going to be busy Monday at noon? Some of the staff can have an attitude, too. Any sandwich that comes on bread (as opposed to a bun, that is) is so greasy. Maybe they should drain those too like they do with the fries. It kinda makes you think twice before ordering one. The portions for sides aren't equal, either. One time you get an insane amount of fries, like way too many, the next time they skimp on them. I don't want a pound of them, but I would like more than four, please. Another gripe is when going for lunch, it takes a long time to get your check and then to pay. It should be a given that if you're there during the lunch rush that you're in a hurry, so you shouldn't have to sit there for ten minutes waiting for your bill. The sooner you give it to me, the sooner I'll leave you alone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-germantown-4?start=20,2.088,2.088,2.088,2.088,2.088
34,Drew A.,"Memphis, TN",156,138,354.0,2.0,2013-04-24,"I've been here a ton but most recently on Friday night and I must say I've got a sour taste in my mouth! My wife and I came here with a friend of hers after shopping at Saddle Creek. Everything was fine until I began to eat my Chicken Crispers (which I order all the time) and bit down on a 2 inch long bone! Hurt my mouth pretty bad! I immediately notified my server who you could tell was mortified. He apologized and said he would get his manager for me. The male manager (who I didn't get his name) came over and didn't apologize once and never said he was sorry it happened. He just told me this was ONLY the SECOND time this had happened in his five years there. Never offered to take it off my check, he just offered to make me another batch to which I promptly declined. I tried to finish eating but my appetite was gone as a result of the experience and lack of empathy from the ""manager"". I asked our server if he could take it back and just take it off our bill which he was more than happy to do. The service from our waiter was excellent. However, the manager left a lot to be desired.  Now I know that it's not his fault and he couldn't have done anything to prevent that. This was an error on the part of the supplier. However, I've been to a lot of restaurants and the managers job is to make sure the customers have an enjoyable experience and will repeat their business. I'm not one that normally sends food back, hardly ever in fact, but I was very unhappy with the manager's service.  I left a good tip for the waiter because he was excellent. The manager was a mid-30's white guy with short blonde hair.  Not sure if we will be back to this location which is unfortunate because its close to where we live.

33,Ren G.,"Seattle, WA",123,255,148.0,2.0,2013-08-19,"Chili's is a last resort for me because the food is like a fashion show. It's meant to get your attention and it all kind of tastes the same with slight differences so it can be called ""coherent."" The emphasis is on color and fun more than flavor. And to an extent, that seems to be working out quite well. Just, I actually have something of a palette so I'm a bit too discerning. Cheddars makes better Spinach dip. This is Memphis, so you can get better ribs practically anywhere. Ruby Tuesday has better mozarella sticks. Any Mexican restaurant in town has better chips. So why go here? Well, because it's not a death sentence and you have a giftcard. The one redeeming menu item is the molten chocolate cake. It's worth coming in just for that, if they do it right. The first few years I was eating those, every single one was perfect, but in recent times, I've gotten cake that's still have frozen more than once. Chili's is not the worst thing ever. But it's a lot closer to that than the best.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-germantown-4?start=20,2.184,2.184,2.184,2.184,2.184

Why?  Because I have an autistic toddler who often doesn't want to sit still for a full meal.

15,Chris B.,"Hudson, FL",0,33,32.0,3.0,2015-05-26,"What could have been an outstanding visit, turned into mediocrity due to poor service.  On the menu today: Chicken Fajitas- wonderfully cooked chicken, tasty sauteed peppers and onions on warm tortillas. They were excellent except the fresh Pico was not so fresh.  Mini sliders- always a favorite. Tender Patty, nicely toasted bun, with cheese...yes please. I also am very fond of their new house made pickles on the side. Very garlicky, and delicious. Baked potato soup- it is what it says it is.  A baked potato in soup form. it was very good but took forever to arrive (over 20 minutes). It was unfortunately cold. Watermelon Margarita- the glass was filled with ripe chunks of watermelon, and mixed very well. Slightly sweet, and just a slight kick from the tequila. I will order this again. We had an extremely long wait for our food. As stated before over 20 minutes just for some cold soup. 45 minutes in total waiting for the main meal, and drink. The server was polite, but inattentive, as we had to ask for honey mustard three times, and for refills on water.  Not to mention it took over 10 minutes for a server to take our drink order when we first arrived . The food was great, but make sure you have a long lunch if you decide to eat here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-germantown-4,2.38,2.38,2.38,2.38,2.38
20,Janne Z.,"Arlington, TN",60,60,28.0,1.0,2015-05-28,"So, I just posted about the Chili's on North Germantown Parkway where I ate last Sunday.  So, my dad wanted to eat at Chili's on Tuesday, so since my experience was so bad on Sunday, we decided to go to a different location, so we went to Germantown.  For those of you who don't know, Germantown is a posh area near Memphis, so I assumed it would be a lot better.... you KNOW what they say about you if you assume things.... yep, totally true! First, it took FOREVER to get a server to come wait on us.  We kept looking around the dining room, which wasn't nearly full as we went after 1:00 pm.  No servers were to be found.  The Hostess was not in her post... literally not one single employee was to be seen for at least 15 minutes except the bartender. We were about ready to get up and leave, when she suddenly appeared.  Were they having a party in the back?  So, I ordered Water with LIME.  I hate water, and I am tired of lemon, and since they have a big bar right there, I requested Lime.  The server said it wasn't a problem. .... I received water with a TINY slice of LEMON... no lime.  It took her 10 minutes to find the limes!  When we ordered, I got the Boneless Buffalo Chicken Salad.  If you haven't had it, it's lovely.  It comes with salad, and a breaded chicken breast that's been dipped in buffalo sauce.  It also has little strips of fried tortillas (cute and crispy) and blue cheese.  It comes with ranch dressing as well as a zesty ranch on the side.  This is how I ordered it....  I'll take ONLY the zesty ranch dressing, no regular ranch.  Also, NO BLUE CHEESE, none at all.  I was assured this was ok.   My dad got his hamburger and all was well.  It took FOREVER to get our food.  When it finally did arrive, I asked my dad if his was even mildly warm (his meat or fries).  He said it was warm, but not hot.  My salad had been sitting so long that the ""crispy"" tortilla strips were just a soggy mess and guess what.... BLUE CHEESE ALL OVER THE PLACE!!!!!  I was going to have her take it back and re-do the entire dish... but I didn't want to wait that long especially since she had once again done her disappearing act and was no where, no server was around, so there was no one to flag down to go find my waitress.   WHAT IS WRONG WITH CHILLI'S THESE DAYS?????  Why are the servers going away? Shouldn't there be ONE person on the floor in the event someone needs something... I had asked for 2 Zesty Ranch cups, but she didn't bring the second one... naturally, but she never came back out from the kitchen to ask her for it!!!   She finally brought the check when I had about 2 bites left, WAY too late to get the extra Zesty Ranch.  So her tip was ONLY 10%.  She NEVER offered to refill our water, she never came  to check on us.  IF I go back, I am going to NOT pay with the toy on the table, I'm going to make her do it the old school way and I""m going to write on her ticket... ""The reason you aren't getting a tip is because you don't know how to wait tables"". This seems to be a problem everywhere we go.  What's up with that!  Alas, I think I'll have to stick with my privately owned Mom & Pop restaurants as the chains are getting HORRIBLE.   I DID visit the bathroom in this one.  I had a choice of 3 dirty stalls, so had to wipe the sprinkles off the seat and flush before I could use it.  THAT's disgusting, and It could have been a customer, so I don't blame Chili's for not flushing, but I do blame them when they have those GIANT TP Dispensers that hold 2 enormous rolls of TP and the 2nd roll is almost gone... meaning that they don't fill them up when they are supposed to!!! Fill it up when the FIRST one is empty, so that you ALWAYS have a one huge roll.  It is simply disgusting how badly these places are managed... can you even imagine what they are doing to your food????   I'm about to swear off eating out altogether because this written one-sided conversation is beginning to make my stomach hurt!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-germantown-4?start=20,2.244,2.244,2.244,2.244,2.2440000000000007

First, when we were sat at our booth, it took our waitress 5-10 minutes to come even take our drink order.

When she brought our drinks, we got 2 waters and 3 sprites, so already off to a bad start, but we don't care, we're just happy to have a drink at this point. She eventually takes our order, and a time later we get our food. Now, the food is nothing special, and if you've ever eaten it before you would understand what I mean. Definitely not $10 and up quality. After asking for napkins and sides that were supposed to come with our meals three times, she finally brought them. When she brought us refills, what did we get?

She returned in 14 minutes, ""Sorry, I went to the back to get change & got to talking to the Manager,"" like that was an automatic excuse.  8 more minutes till my Tito's Punch arrived.   My Salad came in 10 minutes, perfect as I was not in a big hurry, but hoping to get out of Rush Hour Traffic & on to the  Game shortly.   I said ""I would like another drink in a few.""  She said ""OK just let me know"" & disappeared for another 15.  My request is usually interpreted as saving the Server another trip to my table, & implies ""Put my drink order in,"" as an early drink is not likely to melt in air conditioning.   A group of loud women who may have already sucked a few down, arrived by 1s & 2s & sat @ tables next to mine.  Erica re-appeared, ""Hey Girl"" & they proceeded to chat.  ""I'll have my usual . . ."" This is Why people dislike dining solo.  Miss Manners would not approve, but I actually held up my empty glass & waved it.  Had she brought my drink out after theirs, I was prepared to comment.  But it came out WITH theirs.   And, of all the nerve, after she swiped my card in the iPad on the table, swung it to me after pre-setting the Tip to 20%!!!  I gave it a whirl backward as she was 2' away staring, it only went back to 17% so I let it be.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-germantown-4,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6

5,Carolyn D.,"Memphis, TN",0,21,,1.0,2017-09-16,"This is an addition to a review posted for Chilis Bar and grill Germantown on Poplar Ave made 9-14-17. Regarding gift card balance stolen of card. I ordered the ribs. The Chillis gift card amount was $15 given to me as a gift during Teacher Appreciation week. I did not leave a tip because the waitress kept me waiting, taking more than 45 minutes to get the order, she did not deserve a tip. So she stole the balance on my gift card. The balance was almost $2.00.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-germantown-4,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68

Having said that, they have a nice bar area with lots of hi-def TVs with sports on 24-7 and their menu has stepped its game up a bit. Try the smoked wings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-germantown-4,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6
