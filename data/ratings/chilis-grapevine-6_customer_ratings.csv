10,Mel B.,"Arlington, TX",19,3,,1.0,2012-04-17,"NO STARS for this place. My BF and I got to Chilis Too in Grapevine Mills Mall, and no one was there to take our name, how many people in our party, etc so we stood out in a line with everyone for 15 minutes. My BF left the line twice to approach the front to check in with a hostess and no one was there. Finally someone came around with a clipboard to ask how many people in each party. During that time, while 10 parties stood outside, we all saw several tables inside with no one tending to them, no one sitting at them. We were finally seated and sat down to a table with dried food, as well as loose food that we had to brush onto the floor. We ordered an appetizer and meals and none of it tasted right. We both were sick later that night. On top of it, our waiter was barely available, the restaurant was not busy or full and we waited forever for drink refills and the check, etc. It took almost 2 hours between the appetizer and check. We could have walked the check and no one would have noticed.  We will never eat there again. Ive contacted Chilis, the mall its located in, and the health department. The Health Department was the only response I've received.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grapevine-6?start=20,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003

9,Hoyt F.,"Grapevine, TX",1,40,,2.0,2013-01-28,"It's a Chili's. The food is decent, affordable, and fairly tasty. This location is actually a small restaurant within the Grapevine Mills Mall, right next to the food court, perfect for a quick meal while out shopping or seeing a movie.  However, the service at this location isn't quite what I've come to expect from Chili's.  The last time I was there I came with three friends. Most of the items came out quickly, were prepared perfectly, and were quite fresh. Mine, however, was missing two items (condiments) that I'd asked for.  This is minor, it happens, but is there any reason it should take 15 minutes for the server to bring a cup of blue cheese dressing and a side of mayo? Is there any reason why I should have to remind the server that he forgot to bring me two items I'd requested and that I'd already reminded him that he'd forgotten them? Is there any reason why I should have to ask a different server to bring the items I'd already asked the original server to bring me three times? I could understand if the restaurant was busy. But when there are only four tables in use this is completely unacceptable.  This isn't an uncommon occurrence. It routinely takes us 10-15 minutes to get a drink refilled. Or we have to ask two or three times for them to bring any item they forget.  There's a reason we only eat here on rare occasions.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grapevine-6?start=20,1.8960000000000001,1.8960000000000001,1.8960000000000001,1.8960000000000001,1.8960000000000001
2,Lex C.,"Irvine, CA",39,101,3.0,2.0,2013-02-18,"This Chili is located in Terminal C in DFW. You know you're in trouble when you have a seat and you notice plastic utensils. I understand we're in an airport but that doesn't mean we're okay with plastic utensils. At first, I thought maybe that was only for bar patrons but I looked over my shoulder and people sitting at tables also had plastic forks and knives. My understanding is that the knife must be plastic due to airport security protocol. However, the fork and spoon need not be plastic. So I'm trying very hard to lower my expectations because once you see plastic utensils, anything else that happens is most likely a step in the right direction. To be safe, I ordered the Jalapeno Smokehouse Bacon Burger and fries. It tasted like one you would find at any other Chili's so that was a good thing. Sort of glad I got what I got because half way through my meal, the gentleman sitting to my left snapped his fork in half while eating his chicken salad. So my advice is to only order food here which does not require any heavy utensil usage (i.e. steaks, salads, etc). The bright spot from this experience was that one of the bartenders...I forget her name...mabye it was Catlin...Anyway, she had this amazingly super blond hair (almost as white as Billy Idol) and I asked her if it was her real color (because I didn't see any roots showing) and glad that she was a good sport about it and said, ""Look at my eyebrows. The eyebrows give it away."" I told her, ""Well, I think it looks great!"" and she thanked me. Summary: There are only 2 reasons why you should eat here. First, your layover is not long enough for you to swing over to Terminal A to dine at Pappadeaux (still my favorite at DFW) or second, you would like to check out Catlin's hair.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grapevine-6?start=20,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000004

4,Jessica P.,"Arlington, TX",2,24,33.0,1.0,2015-07-28,"I warn you DO NOT go here to eat because after reading my review you will know why. I was shopping with my fiancé at this outlet and we I decided to get something to eat before head home.We spotted Chili's & was surprised that they have my favorite restaurant here.We got our table after 15 minutes.The hallway was very little, we had to squeeze in to get to our table.We ordered the usual like we always get because we know what's best at Chili's.Our server was Chris I believe.I ordered a chicken flatbread for appetizer & for the entree I picked the ribeye steak mid-rare & a shrimp and steak fajita.I noticed that they doesn't have any sides to pick for the steak because I usually get 2 sides of my choice and that's what other places do.I didn't care much cause it's a mall so I guess food need to be done fast.The guy said I'll get steamed broccoli & mashed potato on a side which was not my favorite but I could still eat them.After waiting about 10 minutes, there's another guy bring out my flatbread. I'm guessing they're helping each other since it's busy.I was sitting next to my fiancé & we were talking about stuff & suddenly he put the plate very hard on the table without saying any excuse and just walked away. Well that was rude I thought to myself. The flatbread was good and very big as an appetizer.We ate about two slices and the rest of our food came out.I was surprised how the food came out so quick.Mine look great but the fajita didn't quite so well because they seem to be very plain unlike how it should to look like at other Chili's.My fiancé give it a try anyway.It wasn't so bad, steak cooked right and the shrimp seasoned well.I'm right here about to enjoy my steak but just as I put my fork on the steak,I saw a dark line seem to be like a hair.At first I thought it was just the effect what the butter usually make but when I pick it up with the fork,it was really a hair on my steak.So I dropped the fork right away and didn't even wanna look at it.I called up the server and told him about it,he said are you sure this is not your hair(pointing at my fiancé)or your hair(mine).At this point I was really pissed after all the bad services and how he respond that way.I didn't wanna be rude so I said my hair is curly and this plate had been on my side the whole time and my fiancé sitting on the other side,I'm pretty sure there's no way his hair could get stuck on the steak.I told him to just put the steak away for me so he quickly bring the steak to the back.I don't think he heard me because he said I'll go get it fixed.And just about 3 minutes later,he brought out the same plate with the same steak,steamed broccoli and mashed potato.So by the mean of getting it fixed,I guess they just took out the melted butter on the steak with a hair on it and scooped another butter to put it on it.Like Wow! Just to make sure it was the same steak,I check the temperature of the plate And food and yes it was cold, just a little warm on the bottom of the plate.I was totally lost my appetite and didn't even want to touch it.But not to be rude I asked for a to go box to bring it home so the guy doesn't think that we did it on purpose like he thought we did.He figures that we didn't like the food so asked if we want any dessert,he could buy it for us.We simply said no and smile at him but he trying to tell us that he could make it Togo for us too but I didn't think it's appropriate to take his offer.I wasn't mad at him,his service was great it was just the food that make me not hungry anymore.So we packed all the food that was leftover.We didn't really eat anything since the food was all cold and wasn't that great. We chilled there for another 5 minutes and OMG you wouldn't believe what we saw at the across table.A cockroach a size of my pinky nails was crawling all over the table and the food.Good thing that the lady and her daughter were sitting there already left so they didn't saw it.We really don't wanna take any food home and just wanna throw up right now.Once again,I told Chris about it and all he said was I'll be right back then left.A while after the manager came to our table and ask what's going on.We told him about the cockroach and he didn't seem to care much.He didn't even look at the table to check to see if it still there so maybe he could kill it before it gets to another table I was so worried for those people who are still eating there.We were so shocked.The manager then ask us about the steak,and how was it.It wasn't a big deal so I told him I wasn't that hungry so I wanted it Togo(but Really I didn't wanna eat the steak that has a hair on it.If you were me you would understand my feeling)He told us he already took off the steak from the check.That was very generous of him he didn't have to do it because I felt bad.So I went home with this fear in me, even a nice restaurant like Chili's will have cockroach in their food.Please consider before you go here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grapevine-6?start=20,,,,,
6,Sharon C.,"Colleyville, TX",0,21,9.0,1.0,2015-10-16,"Not surprised to see I am not the first to write of the filth of this restaurant.  Beyond disgusting.  So disappointing for a big chain in ""the city"".  I experience this in small country restaurants, but expect better in town. Sat at the bar about a month ago and wanted to order lunch while we had a drink. While we waited for the waiter to make our drinks, we realized we would not be eating anything here. The entire bar area, all of its surfaces and everything behind the bar was filthy. The alcohol bottles were not covered.  We couldn't get out of there fast enough. We elected not to pay with the self-serve unit on the bar top as it was incredibly filthy from numerous greasy fingerprints as well.   Quite obviously, the place doesn't even get a good nightly scrubbing  let alone anything resembling that during the day.   The worst part, is that after we left, my husband observed our bartender using the men's room stall and leaving without washing his hands. He was so furious, he followed him across the hall and observed him log in on the bar's register w/o washing still.  NEVER again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grapevine-6?start=20,,,,,

The water had this chemical taste to it. Ive never tasted counter cleaner but I can safely assume this is what a mouthful of it would taste like. Would have sent ir back but waited another 20minutes for our food to be dumped on the table.  When our food came I had to ask for my salad/ appitizer.

Don't come up and make excuses for yourself and act all arrogant at the same time.  Grapevine Mills Mail is so not what it used to be but I decided to go anyway and then decided to eat at Chili's. I should have known, when I had to wait 10 minutes to be seated but there was only 2 people in the restaurant and they were sitting at the bar.  They seated me at a table and it was the bartender who waited on me not a waiter/ waitress. Plus he was surprised when I didn't order a bar drink and only wanted water.  I showed him on the menu what I wanted. I waited 25 minutes for a California club sandwich. What came out was not a sandwich. It was flat bread pizza.  The girl that brought it out was rude and inconsiderate and said this is what I have for you. I said that wasn't what I ordered. She said I would have to wait another 8-10 minutes and I said for a sandwich? She said well you can leave! I said get the manager.  Manager came and said he would get the sandwich done quickly and I told him ok. I also told him the guy that took my order was more concerned that I didn't order a drink than what I ordered. I said I even pointed at it on the menu. Told him the waitress was also rude. Said he was sorry and went to get my order started.  Then the bartender decided he needed to come apologize. Would have been nice if he hadn't been so arrogant.  Then as I was eating he came back by and asked if everything was good I said it was fine and he then reached for my plate to take it. I said I'm not finished and he said oh ok. He said he thought me saying it's fine meant I was finished. ( I hadn't even touched my fries! )  After thT he came back 2 more times within 5 minutes.

We waited for a while for someone to come to the front to seat us, (another lady standing in line with us had to walk into the restaurant to find someone). Once we finally were seated, it was almost 10 minutes before our waitress came to take our drink orders. One of our appetizers came out pretty quickly, but my husband's salad didn't come out until they brought his meal. When my fajitas came out, they brought the wrong kind of tortillas and we had no silverware (my husband did not have his meal at this point). We sat there for a few minutes looking around in sheer disbelief. Our waitress finally comes over and we explain that we still need my husband's appetizer, his meal, my corn tortillas, and silverware. She goes back and returns shortly thereafter with his salad and meal. Still no tortillas or silverware for the both of us... returns a couple of minutes later with our silverware and explains they didn't have any clean utensils... uhhhhh?!?! And then my tortillas finally come after I had to to mention it to people on 3 different occasions. Thankfully, my semi-cold chicken fajitas were scrumptious (the only highlight of the trip!). We finish our meal and wait for our waitress to come and ask if we'd like our dessert (we had previously ordered). Instead, she comes and asks if we'd like our check... had to remind her that we'd ordered dessert, and she then puts the order in. Anyways, finally go to pay and our ziosk doesn't work and our waitress doesn't offer us another option, so we couldn't even get reward points for our outing.
