14,David K.,"Urbana, IL",0,28,,4.0,2012-11-15,"It's a Chili's.  What more needs to be said?  Unless you've never been to a Chili's, I guess.  The food was a good, although the waitress we had was sub-par.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-2,,,,,
13,Ashok G.,"Chatham Township, NJ",10,71,52.0,3.0,2013-02-12,Hung out with my friend after several yrs. Location is mapped incorrectly and i almost got lost until i realized i am driving nowhere. Love their chocolate lava cake. Staff was not polite and food was just OK.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-2,,,,,
12,Emily B.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",31,65,9.0,5.0,2013-04-11,"I'm from LA, and I love this small Chili's. The staff was nice and friendly on the busy Wednesday night. I sat in the bar with my father and uncle to catch up on good times. My uncle and I came to town for the funeral of my grandpa. We sat and chat forever, and the waitress, Ashleigh, was very nice and allowed us to take up the table for 2 hours. I had wings and Sam Adams, such a good combo, while my family had the happy hour drinks. My wings and beer were even on the happy hour menu. Overall, because of my unfortunate family get together, Chili's provided a great place to catch up with family I have not seen in years.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-2,,,,,
5,Rick G.,"Indianapolis, IN",316,413,41.0,4.0,2014-11-26,"Once again, in my eyes, Chili's raises the bar for chain restaurants in my eyes.  We were passing through at dinner time, on the way to Cincy, and wanted more than fast food, so stopped in at Chili's. I had one of their burgers, and I believe Chili's has outstanding burgers.  Done just like I requested, a very good burger indeed.  My wife and a soup an salad combo and it was good also. The service was good, even though it was HOPPING at 530 on a Friday. I seldom stop at chain restaurants when I'm on the road.  When I do, it's a Chili's because they've earned my repeat business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-2,,,,,
7,Tyrone B.,"Indianapolis, IN",4,45,16.0,5.0,2015-08-23,The food here was great. The server name Kristin was excellent. She made our dining experience a good one. If you ever come to this chilis definitely try to get Kristin as your server.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-2,,,,,
8,Chris R.,"Memphis, TN",0,12,1.0,5.0,2015-11-26,"Perfect for biz dining and sitting at the bar. Nice bar, 3 TV's, decent assortment of beer & booze. I had grilled fish one night and a burger the other.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-2,,,,,
9,Kasey B.,"Greensburg, IN",1,19,5.0,5.0,2015-12-17,I love eating here! Never had a bad meal. Always have had good service. The newer menu is awesome!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-2,,,,,
6,Andrew W.,"Columbus, IN",2,3,1.0,1.0,2016-04-14,"Been here twice this week.both times waited forever. Finally got served to have to argue with the waitress about what I wanted to order. Last time I check customer is always right. I'll drive to Columbus Chili's before I come back to this one. Management is poor, service needs much work and training.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-2,,,,,
10,Frank E.,"Fishers, IN",0,13,,4.0,2016-06-18,"This is one of the few chain restaurants we in. The reason we like this one ? It's not run like a corporate chain. The servers, especially Traci, are all great. They make you feel like family. The manager hires great people and retains them because he lets them do what they are good at. You can feel how much they all care. The food is never over done. The service is quick and the prices fair. Great house wine ... Really intelligent choices for quality and value. We are regulars and will be so for years. Great place !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-2,,,,,
3,Anita M.,"Greensburg, IN",31,51,11.0,4.0,2017-07-09,"We frequent this Chili's. The food is cooked to order, friendly service, and fairly quick. We also order to go from here which is very convenient with their app. It's ready in typically 20 minutes. Only once did we have an issue and that was just I felt there should have been more guacamole on my burger. :).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-2,,,,,
2,Alison R.,"Greensburg, IN",12,3,18.0,1.0,2017-07-31,"We had an hour for dinner on a Monday night. The restaurant was mostly empty.  To the point: it was not a great place to dine. It was a poor experience. Tepid food, congealed cheese on cold fries for an appetizer, grilled (I think) sliced chicken with a splash of red spice on some of it as ""fajitas.""  Kids meals way over priced for value. Service slow. Nothing was really very hot, or appetizing. We left the majority of it uneaten...and for what was served, WAY expensive... especially since we were overcharged.   My family eats at restaurants several times a week...I really doubt we ever return to this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-2,,,,,
4,Britney B.,"Shelbyville, IN",0,22,1.0,5.0,2017-09-10,"Amazing service. We went today, Sunday, for lunch. Our food came out quick and we had a great waitress. She was kind and polite. She was on top of everything, which isn't always easy because I am specific with my sandwiches. I recommend asking for the waitress named Danielle. You won't be disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-2,,,,,
0,D N.,"Saint Marys, OH",0,11,20.0,5.0,2017-12-27,"Food food oh wonderful food. The menu was filled with wonderful choices. I was out of town for four days for work and and CHOSE to eat here every night, we had a variety of different items. Everything was fantastic. Way to go Chili's. You are back on top.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-2,,,,,
1,Linda H.,"South Haven, MI",8,90,186.0,3.0,2018-01-01,"Hubby had the old timer and said it was good. I ordered the lunch combo of potatoes soup & two hamburger sliders ""Big Bites"". Soup came cold, the waiter did reheat butttttt The sliders looked good but there wasn't really any taste.  They were supposed to have a ranch dressing on them but they didn't. We hadn't been to Chili's in a while & it will be another while before we go back. Restrooms weren't real clean either :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-2,,,,,
