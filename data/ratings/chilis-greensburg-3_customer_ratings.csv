13,Nick F.,"Haarlem, The Netherlands",178,767,309.0,3.0,2013-12-16,"This is your average Chilli's.  The menu is huge and there are a lot of choices.  The food quality is okay but nothing spectacular or out of the ordinary.  The service was friendly except for the greeter who seemed to just be going through the motions until it was time for his shift to be over. In short a decent place to go if you are in Greensburg but nothing different than many of the other places in the area,",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-3,,,,,
16,Stacy P.,"Cherry Tree, PA",3,12,6.0,4.0,2015-04-21,I come here mostly for the southwestern chicken soup it's my favorite it's just spicy enough and it has a nice crunch added with the tortilla strips on top,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-3,,,,,
15,Michelle T.,"Gastonia, NC",3,4,1.0,4.0,2015-06-27,"Watermelon margaritas are back!  Get them before they are gone again.   Service here isn't the fastest,  but they are friendly.   Food is typical Chili's ; nothing out of the ordinary.   Good place to bring the family.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-3,,,,,
17,Joe C.,"Mount Pleasant, PA",17,4,2.0,1.0,2015-11-14,At Chili's and waitress Michelle is acting like total ass telling manager to fire her. Now she is bitching to co-Worker's about how hard she works. My advice...go to Red Robin their servers are more professional.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-3,,,,,
7,Samantha E.,"University Heights, OH",174,895,271.0,4.0,2015-12-12,"Chili's is a chain, but I've liked it for years, and it's always comfortably predictable. Most often, we just get takeout and order the Two for $20 menu-- my husband is partial to the steak and the ribs, and I'm more likely to get fajitas or a burger.  Some of our other favorites are the southwestern egg rolls, anything with guacamole, chicken crispers, and the shrimp tacos.  I can't recommend the turkey burger (dry and not very flavorful) or the enchiladas with sour cream sauce.  When I'm looking for healthier options, the sirloin with grilled avocado is my favorite of the section; the chicken options are good, but rely on broccoli as a side to keep the calorie count low, so if you're a broccoli-hater you still run into problems.   Prices are generally reasonable, especially with the Two for $20 deal or the lunch combinations.  Service tends to be a bit overwhelmed if you dine in, but I've never had problems with accuracy on takeout.  Nothing spectacular, but I'm still a fan.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-3,,,,,
8,Lizelle A.,"Blairsville, PA",191,386,1661.0,4.0,2016-01-16,"This is my favorite chain restaurant mainly because of the southwestern egg rolls. I often crave this appetizer because it has just the amount of chicken, beans, corn and cheese and is perfectly fried. And the ranch dipping sauce is delightful. We had a very good waitress that was efficient and attentive. We were thoroughly entertained by the ziosk computers on the table. You can play games for 99 cents, but why spend the money when everyone has so many apps on their phone. But I loved that I could order my dessert on it because usually waitstaff tends to stop paying attention to guests after the entrees have been served. My molten lava chocolate cake was just what I needed on a cloudy cold day. Gooey and chocolatey with the ice cream and hardened chocolate she'll. I think I'm going to have sweet dreams about it tonite. As soon as we finished we paid on the ziosk and bounced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-3,,,,,
18,Stephen W.,"Saltsburg, PA",21,3,,5.0,2016-02-13,we come here at least once a week or more.friendly servers who already know what my son wants when we walk in and our usally Michele is the best.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-3,,,,,
6,Jennifer G.,"Pittsburgh, PA",100,411,180.0,3.0,2016-05-05,"This is about average for Chilis and is rather hit or miss with both food and service.  We've ordered and received cold food or wrong items and we've had service and food that was beyond expectations. We started with skillet queso a favorite of my husband.  It was cold and very runny.  The waitress tried to tell us that it is served at room temperature.  Sorry but we've ordered it enough times to know that it should be warm.  The entrees came out only minutes after the appetizer so it seemed something was off with the timing.   It seems that the serving size has become smaller but prices are higher.   Make sure you sign up for the rewards program because you'll earn free food items. Overall not a bad experience, but not a great one either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-3,,,,,
9,Leslie S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",142,218,228.0,3.0,2016-05-20,"I used to come here often when I lived in Greensburg, but it's been several years since my last visit. Yesterday, while out running a ton of errands in the area, my husband and I stopped for lunch. It was exactly 12:00 when we arrived and the place was pretty crowded, but we did manage to score the last booth in the bar area. We both ordered off of the lunch menu, which includes a soup or salad, a sandwich, half sandwich, tacos, or quesadilla, and fries for $6 - $8, depending on what sandwich item you choose. My husband got the Chicken Quesadillas with a bowl of Chili ($&7) and I got the Top Shelf Tacos with a Fresco Salad ($8). My salad was described as a ""spring mix tossed in honey-lime vinaigrette & topped with queso fresco"". I guess I didn't expect it to be just that - lettuce, dressing, and cheese. There were no other veggies, nothing else on the salad. I guess it's my own fault for assuming. Nonetheless, it wasn't bad. The H said his chili was good, also.  About halfway through our meals, I noticed something sharp in one of my tacos. I spit it out into my hand just as the manager was stopping at our table to check on us. She asked if everything was okay, and I said it was...since I didn't have time to inspect what this foreign object was. It didn't matter, she noticed my concern and my out-stretched hand and actually held out her hand for me to give her the piece of whatever it was. To me, it looked like an extremely small twig, but I told myself it was probably just a large piece from some spice they used. The manager quickly went in the back, then came to check on us a few minutes later. She asked if I was okay and if I wanted something else to eat. Frankly, I was pretty much full at this point, so I said no. The waitress came by a few minutes later to refill our drinks and check on us. She said that the manager comp'ed my meal and apologized. She also asked me if I wanted anything else to eat, but I said no, I was fine. The waitress could not identify the inanimate either, but said it may have been a piece from a skewer (eww). Sadly, I've found worse in my food at other places - an ant, a twisty bread tie, a staple, hair. So really, it could have been worse. My husband enjoyed his meal and, overall, the situation was handled satisfactory, so really no complaints. The strange object excluded, my meal was still simply okay. Solid 3 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-3,,,,,
14,Jason W.,"Greensburg, PA",0,8,,4.0,2016-05-28,"These guys are good at what they do, which is serve you decent food, cold beer, and good mixed drinks quickly and at a reasonable price. It's a chain, so don't expect anything out of this world, but it's a solid place that's never disappointed me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-3,,,,,
5,Valerie V.,"Boston, PA",35,97,325.0,4.0,2016-07-12,"When I thought of of going to chilis in the past I've always had a salad or chicken in my mind...for what ever reason I didn't think of them when I was hungry for southwest food...that will change going forward. Had the prime rib burrito it was surprisingly delish, I highly recommend it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-3,,,,,
12,Nadja P.,"Craryville, NY",8,11,3.0,1.0,2016-08-22,"Tried to eat here at lunchtime today. Tons of people waiting and some had waited so long, they were taking their names off the list. We were told it was a 20-25 minute wait. At lunch? We were not allowed to sit at the bar, though it was empty. And the hostess told us that the backup was because of a huge party of 10. Really? A Chilis that can't handle a party of 10? No apologies given. Poor management.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-3,,,,,
11,Boo F.,"West Newton, PA",0,5,,1.0,2017-03-03,The worst overpriced crappy food. The only taste from the ribs was freezer burn. That paired well with ice cold fries. No smoke flavor at all. Fajitas of chicken and extra $1:00 for shrimp sucked. Everything seems to be an up charge better love cilantro they put enough on it be a side salad. Typical chain restaurant  should of learned by now. YUK !!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-3,,,,,
3,Matthew U.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2086,1447,650.0,3.0,2017-03-08,"Your typical Chili's that you will find anywhere across the country.  Not much else to write about here.  The food is standard, service decent, interior clean. The only thing that was odd about this place is that even though it sits along a busy stretch of road, it was almost completely dead inside.  Not sure why that is.  It was a little offsetting, but I still managed to have a good, quick meal from here.   Loaded boneless wings were good, maybe a little more salty than I would have liked, but a great way to start a meal.  I opted for what they call an Old Tymer with cheese.  Your basic cheeseburger.  The patty was thick and the toppings were plenty.  The one thing that I like was that they give you extra pickles on the side that appear to be made in house.  However the ratio of pickle to garlic clove was way off and I had about five full cloves of garlic to three pickles.  I suppose as long as the small cup is filled with something they are all right with it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-3,,,,,
4,James D.,"Smithfield, PA",1,113,1693.0,4.0,2017-04-21,"We love eating here. It's definitely a better healthier option than the fast food places around. The nachos and salsa are our favorite. Especially when they are fresh and hot. We normally order the fajitas and have never been disappointed. The table-side guacamole is nice, but the regular guacamole off the menu is just as good. It's always clean here (especially the restrooms) which is always 1st on my wife's list. Normally in and out in 1 hour. Enjoy",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-3,,,,,
1,Deborah N.,"Greensburg, PA",28,231,420.0,4.0,2017-05-08,"This restaurant chain offers nice lunch specials and combos.   Usually, I am happy to get the southwestern rolls and bowl of chili.   The salads are very good, also.  Husband and I used to come here all the time for happy hour.  I  am not sure what kind of drink specials they offer presently.  Service was fast and friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-3,,,,,
10,Courtney G.,"Latrobe, PA",0,6,,4.0,2017-07-03,Since my first review I have seen great improvement. The customer service did contact me which was greatly appreciated. The curbside Togo service is wonderful! Thanks for the improvements!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-3,,,,,
2,Sherry M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",37,223,992.0,3.0,2017-07-08,"We as a family has always liked dining at Chili's. The Fajita's are one of the best around. We were one of the first to be seated this afternoon for lunch as the restaurant just opened. The service was great, the food was really good.  At first we received cold fries, but the servicer quickly replaced them with very hot fries, which we enjoyed and appreciated, but the star I have taken away is for the bathrooms that I found first thing in the morning not cleaned from the night before. There was no one in the restaurant other than two families. I spoke to the Manager he, was given notice and said thank you for reporting the issue to him. I do like the kiosk that is quick and easy to use.  We enjoyed our lunch and will return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-3,,,,,
0,Andrew B.,"Mt Lookout, Cincinnati, OH",237,436,1207.0,4.0,2017-11-07,"This Chili's location will always hold a special place in my heart. I helped open this store way back in 2005. I was a host here for the first six months this place was open. You know..way back in the day when ""would you like smoking or non"" was the question I asked most when customer would walk through the front doors. Anywho, it looks pretty much the same as it did back. There are some slight seating differences than what I remember, but nothing too different. It seems like it has been kept up pretty well for the past 12 years (jeez oh man..has it really been 12 years? ..my god). The food here is on par with other Chili's locations. We ordered the endless chips and salsa like we always do. They were brought out fresh and were refilled before they ever got close to running out. I didn't get an entree because I had just eaten a huge chicken sandwich (see previous review)..but my girlfriend got the big mouth bites and said they were really good. Service here was really good. The servers worked together and things came out fast and everything refillable stayed filled throughout the entire meal. I'm happy this place has stayed open and endured for the past 12 years, especially with the way the industry has been going. I look forward to stopping here again in the future and boring my friends and family with all the crazy hosting stories I have from there from back in the day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-greensburg-3,,,,,
