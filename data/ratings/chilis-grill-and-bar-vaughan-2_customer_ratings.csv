35,Drake B.,"Waterloo, Canada",7,59,80.0,4.0,2012-01-14,"Never been to Chili's? Think south western. The place is great. The food is consistently good. It has that Tex-Mex comfort that goes beyond nachoes and burgers. Have you been to Chili's? This is just like the others. Being in Canada hasn't screwed it up. It is normal.  While I was there, I checked in using YELP and I was given a free coupon. I showed my phone the waiter and I was given complimentary tortilla chips and salsa.

10,S M.,"Thornhill, Canada",21,20,,1.0,2012-01-27,i used to go to this location a fair bit then something changed. The portions were smaller and the service was slower. One time I waited 15 minutes for the server to come to the table. When I complained the manager was abrupt and rude.

32,Linda M.,"Toronto, Canada",89,112,2.0,1.0,2012-06-11,"On a fun day of random-adventures with a rental car, my grew-up-in-the-States boyfriend saw the sign for Chili's.  I decided not to be my usual restaurant-snob self and let him choose.  Unfortunately neither of us left happy. Warning: the following review is very restaurant-snobbish.  This reviewer is clearly spoiled by Toronto choices When we walked in, I was immediately struck by how so many chain restaurants look so similar.  Big signs all over the huge space, cartoon-y images, even the tables.  Opening the menu I was kind of surprised though - for lunch, there was nothing under $10.  I was really hoping to get something light (to save money for future better restaurants), and figured since it was a chain there was a good chance they would have cheaper options.  I ordered the cheapest thing that looked appealing and somewhat filling: a turkey club sandwich.  The boyfriend ordered the Grilled chicken sandwich.   We got our meals shortly after...and wow.  Flavour, presentation, uniqueness....all completely absent.  I could have made that club sandwich when I was 12 years old.  It was basically on Wonder bread!  The fries, I'll admit, had good seasoning.  It's too bad they were completely undercooked and limp.  Not undercooked to the point of being raw, just not at all crispy - they drooped when picked up.  I didn't try my DP's sandwich, and I'm usually all over everyone else's food.  Zero interest this time.   The boyfriend kept apologizing for the choice, but it wasn't his fault.  Apparently they've gone seriously downhill in the last few years.  All in all...if you're thinking of stopping in here, keep driving.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-vaughan-2,,,,,

6,David H.,"Mississauga, Canada",30,83,,3.0,2012-07-27,"Chili's is pretty good as far as those apostrophe chain restaurants go (i.e. Montana's, Kelsey's, Casey's, Jack Astor's, Turtle Jack's.....). Of the times I've eaten here I like their burgers the best.  The jalapeno burger is my personal favourite.  Also the deconstructed ice cream bar is a great dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-vaughan-2?start=20,,,,,
26,Abbas N.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",381,272,68.0,3.0,2012-08-22,"If someone asked me what I thought of Chili's, I'd say ""Chili's reminds me of my childhood. Walking on Jumierah Beach, we'd go here after for the unlimited chips and salsa...and for every occasion we had to have the molten Lava Cake... Seriously though, Chili's was my favourite place growing up in Dubai. It's everyone's . We love it there. (Too bad they don't serv the alchz there) So when I heard that they opened up here in Canada, I got mad teary eyed and grabbed all my friends from Dubai and we headed over here. The menu was almost the same,  I was so happy. So we got the trio appz to start (called The Triple Play)  which was the texmex egg rolls, wings and chicken crispers) Firstly, In Dubai you get wings, the egg rolls and the dip. WTF with the crispers.  They were okay. Definitely not what I remembered. To eat, I got the Chicken Crispers meal with the Corn on cob, mashed potatoes, and Chicken Gravy. The Chicken was maaaad salty. The Gravy tasted like despair. But I think that's just how I feel abut chicken gravy anyways. My friend got th fajitas, which were relaly good. And ofcourse, we had to have the piece du resistance, the MCLC (Molten Choco Lava Cake) It was a tad bit burnt, but otherwise...just like we remembered it. We've been back a few times...mostly for the MCLC. And the Sangria in the summer. I drank like three pitchers of that in one sitting. Also, the friend I was with at that time didn't drink.

33,Melissa a.,"Toronto, Canada",3,26,,1.0,2012-08-27,"I've never even been to this restaurant in the US but we were in the mood for burgers and after looking at their menu online it sounded appeitizing. We order the Smokehouse burger and the Jalapeno Smokehouse. First off, the place and the cutlery/glasses/plates are dirty. We order a pitcher of beer and the glasses had what looked like BBQ sauce on the rim. I took my napkin and wiped it along and sure enough it was some sort of sauce. I mentioned it to the server and she brought me another one and the second one was clean-er... it has less BBQ sauce along the rim but nevertheless it had to be wiped off. The cutlery/plates looked banged up as if this place had been around for 100 years, its only a few years old I dont know why everything appeared so run down. As for the food, it was alright. The burgers were decent. If it werent for the bacon, which was very flavorful, the burgers would be nothing. Btw, my boyfriend ordered onion rings, and instead got a side of onion straws, you know the same topping that was in his burger- which didnt make any sense. Would I go back? Nope",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-vaughan-2,,,,,

28,Canchi M.,"Markham, Canada",115,97,199.0,4.0,2012-10-24,"Chili's experience was great! we start of with a tequila pop. it's something I haven't seen for a long time. (when I first started drinking, me and my friends always do tequila pop...) then we are back on the right track with the Presidente margarita, we were shown what kind of tequila were used, and the way they serve it was great (for both side of the business and customer) we learned a lot about what great margarita is. then we get to try the Blackberry Margarita and Strawberry Margarita. I like them all! XD ranking would be  1. Presidente Margarita 2. Strawberry Margarita 3. Blackberry Margarita then we were served the best of the best, the Platinum Presidente Margarita!!! it's much smoother than the Presidente Margarita (it's already smooth, I didn't know it can be better!) oh, and I wanted to get the Platinum Presidente Margarita glass shaker as a water bottle... XD (I forgot to check-in to the place, so I forgot about the check-in offer that they have, it's free Tostada Chips + House made Salsa) (we did have food afterwards, that's the Savour York Region Restaurant week, from Oct 18 to 28, 2012.

19,Kris U.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",2917,1220,3534.0,4.0,2012-10-24,"Last night the Savour York Region Restaurant week brought a cast of yelpers out to Chili's for a taste of Tex-Mex at an incredible price. The promotional menu offered us our choice of Appetizer, Main and Dessert for the very appetizing price of $25/ person! More on the food in moments... The weather may have kept some of the regulars at bay BUT...Sitting at the bar last night with my friends we were treated to an amazing, educational experience by Chili's Owner Heath. As I ordered a round of Presidente Margaritas (their premium Margarita) for my friends Heath began to give us a Tequila 101 session. Speaking the varying grades and types of Tequila. Explaining how the taste of tequila changes from the lower grade stuff used in a tequila popper up to the premium grade tequila used in their margaritas. Then came the best part...the taste. Being a summer margarita fella, these really impressed the pants off of me. Not overly limey, smooth finish, and without the harsh shudder of tequila. Heath was right! A better Tequila (Casadores - Reposado) DOES make a better Margarita. I can honestly say this was the first time I've ever enjoyed sipping on ANY drink that had tequila as an ingredient. And at $8.99??? Bargain!!! The real treat was when bartender Robin and Heath saw how much we enjoyed our Presidente's, they offered to let us try the Platinum Presidente's (we shared to get the taste). Similar in taste to the regular one but with even less notes of the tequila and an even smoother flavour - officially SOLD me on the stuff! After our education in tequila we got our dinner on. Canchi (Billy) and I shared the Cheesy Poppers and the Eqq Rolls. Cheesy poppers were freshly made and the cheese inside was gooey and had a nice kick from the Jalapenos. The Egg rolls were great and I loved the black beans inside of it :) For my main I decided to pass on the ribs as I had them the last time I was in and went for the Beef Fajitas. While it was fairly standard Fajita fare what set it apart for me was the tenderness of the beef. Cooked to a perfect medium rare and so tender I could cut it with a fork. Awesome!  We concluded our dinner with Desert - I opted for the Chocolate motlen cake which proved to be more than I could handle. Tasty, Chocolatey and a nice scoop of ice cream on top tipped in chocolate. Chili's has impressed me and is my new guilty pleasure in Vaughan. I'll be there using their free wifi more often and maybe taking advantage of more President's Margaritas during Happy Hours!

I went with my friend to share a penne pasta and I told them to put the cheese on the side because my friend was lactose but not severe. not only did the chef not do that because he forgot. he added a little (wasnt a little) of cheese and added more on the side. when the server came and asked how our food was I told her there was a little too much cheese. and she offered to re-make our food but I said it was ok I didn't want the hassle. she then told the boss and he came over and CONFRONTED us telling that penne pasta originally has cheese. NO it doesn't for those chefs out there that know what I'm talking about. on top of that, the boss not only didn't apologize or offer a discount, he made it seem like it was our fault to begin with by ordering penne pasta. he said this exact sentence ""just letting you guys know penne pasta originally has a cheese base. just be careful what you order.""

21,Jim B.,"Vaughan, Canada",44,653,411.0,2.0,2013-01-01,"I've visited Chili's in the good old U.S. of A., so I was excited to see that the chain was pushing into Canada. After dining here.....I'm not that excited anymore. Let me preface this by stating that I haven't dined here in about a year, as my last experience was so disappointing that I swore I would never go back. Our group of 4 all remember the last time as a deal killer. On our last visit the place was a jumpin'. We had a nominal wait for a table and while waiting we thought to ourselves...""This is great....a busy restaurant is usually a sign of good food""  Wrong. The waiter was awful. His approach was off putting from the get go (he had someone trailing him so I would assume he was training someone??). Wrong person to do so. His was very robotic/unfriendly and didn't seem to really like working there. He commented to the person with him how he couldn't wait to get out of there. After tasting the food, I now understand what he was taking about. Anyways, we asked a question about a menu item and the sigh that came from the guy was audible to Vancouver.... Once we ordered, the food took forever to come out. When it did, it was not HOT, it was lukewarm. It also tasted like cardboard...absolutely no flavour considering the place is called Chilis. We did not complain to our waiter due to his already foul mood and besides, once our food was in front of us we never saw him again except when we flagged him down to get our bill. We did not finish our meals (a good waiter would have picked up on the fact that 4 people left half their meals on their plates and would ask.....but not ours). We paid our bill (which was pricey considering the quality of what we got). Sorry if I can't be more specific about what we ordered, etc....but it has been a while since I've been here. The whole experience was not pleasant at all and that is what we remember the most.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-vaughan-2,,,,,
30,Charles R.,"Mississauga, Canada",14,120,4.0,1.0,2013-05-01,"Chili's is a branch of the US restaurant located in Vaughan, Ontario - hometown of the worst drivers in Canada.  If you don't get run over by a paisano going through the 4-way stop out of turn in his Ford F150 you're on your way to good food, and poor service. This restaurant has been The Red Devil, and East Side Mario's in it prior existance. We came here on a Saturday afternoon to celebrate my son's birthday.  Our group of 9 was seated promptly. SERVICE Our drink order was taken quickly.  However it took 20+ minutes for our collection of soda and chocolate milk to arrive at our table.  At one point my daughter was asked if she wanted a refill on her chocolate milkshake.  We should have been told that it was not a free refill. Our order of bottomless nacho chips and salsa arrived at our table less than 10 min before our entree did, so we weren't really able to enjoy it. The ice cream for the kids arrived well before my son's birthday brownie slice.  About 20% of the ice cream was melted by the time the brownie arrived. I think the manager overheard us complaining about how incompetant our server was, so we were compensated 2 lava cake desserts for the table. Final point - if you're going to automatically include a 15% gratuity on the bill, can you please ensure the service merits that kind of gratuity.  My parents taught me to be a 10% tipper, and I will tip 15% only when either the food was amazing or the server went out of their way for us. FOOD My son had the mac and cheese and loved it.  Older daughter had the grilled cheese and devoured it.  Youngest daughter had the cheese pizza - I tried a taste and it was icky.  I think it was a microwave pizza from M&Ms. The wife had the honey chicken crispers.  She felt they were comparable to the Chili's in Buffalo (that's a good thing).  I had the Jalepeno Smokehouse burger.  If you like a burger that's a balance between pain and pleasure - then you've found it.  You have the heat from the Jalepeno's offset by the taste of the bacon. For dessert we were compensated a chocolate lava cake.  It was darn good, especially the lava. On its own, the food could have netted 3.5 stars.  Service and Ambiance killed this. AMBIANCE The restaurant was good.  Well lit, fairly new feel to it. The men's washroom was a different story.  One of the urinals was broken and spewing water all over the place.  Putting a caution wet floor sign up doesn't really cover you from slip and fall lawsuits.  If the plumbing were up to current code, someone with a wrench could have shut off the water flow from the urinal, and the entire washroom floor wouldn't have been a mess. I had brought this to the manager's attention.  I was told that she had to wait her her guy.  I'm assuming it was someone under contract to corporate.  Managers should have the power to call whomever they want.  This is a business and there are a lot of 24-hour plumbing services that would be willing to help out.  There has to be a balance between frugality and maintaining the image of the business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-vaughan-2,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36
20,Ehsan F.,"Toronto, Canada",90,217,265.0,3.0,2013-05-25,"The first visit to Chili's north of the border has left me unimpressed to say the least. To be fair, I was never fond of my American visits either. I only remember them as being quick pit-stops on the I-5. The food is extremely bland, which is ironic given their name. Forget Mexican food, they give Tex-Mex a bad name. So atleast I can commend them for being consistently mediocre as a franchise.  My Philly cheese steak had this odd looking brown cheese sauce which reeked of processed cheese smell. The fries were incredibly starchy despite looking so good. Other members of our party were equally disappointed with their Tacos. I was also annoyed by the pint of Rolling Rock I was served. In addition to being poured with a very large head, I noticed it being distinctly flat and unusual in taste (I've had this beer many times in the past).  I feel like the food deserves no better than a 2. However, I do feel obliged to factor in the attentive and courteous service as well as the friendly visits to our table by the owner. It is also worth mentioning that they run a pretty clean joint unlike some of their American counterparts.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-vaughan-2,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36
24,Jessie G.,"North York, Canada",7,11,,1.0,2013-07-07,"One review is generous for this place. That said, our waitress was very attentive and did her job. And as other commenters have noted, this location has nothing on the ones in the US. Came here last weekend because the bf knew my obsession with just about anything Tex-Mex.  I love fajitas. At Chili's there were two options. The 18.99$ classic with a choice of chicken or beef, or 22.99$ mushroom fajitas, which came with a mushroom base. Being a pescatarian, I was told that I could have an all-shrimp classic fajita, but at the 22.99$ price. I opted to add guacamole for an additional 2.49$ and a side of mushrooms for 2.29$. My 22.99$ fajitas came with three pieces of lukewarm tortillas, exactly six pieces of shrimps, an overwhelmingly large amount of onions and green peppers. The guacamole was not only bland but also tasted of unripe avocados. However, the *STAR* of my meal was the mushrooms. They were so thinly sliced that they resembled the canned variety. Our suspicion  was confirmed when my bf picked up some with his spoon, the liquid was not only runny but also TASTED like it came from a can. On the bright hand side, my bf's burger was good, but the fries were lukewarm and undercooked. However, the best part of our night was right before we left, the hostess was nice enough to inquire about our night. When she heard about our experience, she offered to call a manager. I told the manager, Patricia, that not only was I unhappy about paying 30$ for such an underwhelming meal, and that Jackastors not only had a better but cheaper version, her response was ""WELL, first of all, we are NOT Jackastors, Ok? We make our food very differently, I'm sorry you didn't enjoy your food."" What I hate the most is that she blatantly lied to me about the mushrooms, saying that it was freshly cut, and definitely not from a can. Where else could the disgusting liquid come from? We made the unfortunate mistake of wasting 70$. Don't do the same!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-vaughan-2,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32

We began to question if the restaurant was in trouble.) Overall, the food is what you expect from a chain restaurant--nothing to write home about.

Chilis seemed to be a less frequented option and the check in offer for chips and salsa lured us in.  The food is good, service is good. Not great but you can't expect to get 5 star food at a tex-mex place in Woodbridge.  I enjoyed my chicken fajitas. The Texas-sized option is great for sharing, also liked that we each got our own plate of toppings. We were served 6 warm tortillas and had our waiter offer a refill.

25,Cass L.,"Toronto, Canada",81,37,137.0,2.0,2014-01-24,"Firstly! Who ever constructed this building built it backwards. The entrance of this tex-mex restaurant faces the opposite way of the parking, unlike the other stores and food chains located at this plaza. It is blistering cold in this Canadian weather and to take a 2-3 minute walk in the cold at -30 degrees is extremely brutal.  When we came in the restaurant was completely empty with maybe about 3-4 other tables occupied in this very big restaurant. We had to stand at the front for about a minute or two before the server came to seat us down. Which I thought was a long time for a place that was fairly empty.  As I was looking at the menu my friends and I noticed that there was a promotion for a free app by just liking their FB page. However when we brought this up to the server he told us that we had to print it out and bring it back our next visit - pretty disappointing. After this I went on my Yelp app to sign in and to my surprise I got a free coupon for salsa and chips. When I brought this up to the server he was shocked and wasn't sure what was going on.. so he went to his manager. The manager then came over to us and brought us our salsa and chips. He seemed very nice and told us that because he's in charge of the ads on Yelp he would treat us exceptionally nice. He also asked us if the server told us about any of their specials and we responded with a no. So he told us about the specials which were discounted drinks.. however because two out of the 4 were driving we didn't want to drink. Just water for the night.  We looked at the menu and wanted to order the Texas Cheese Poppers but when we asked for them the server told us they were sold out... SHOCKING because this place was empty who else has been eating them? :( So we decided to go for the platter which has egg rolls, chicken bites and sliders. It was okay... I've had better. I really liked the egg rolls the most but I really wanted to try the Cheese Poppers.  I ordered the Chicken Enchilada Pasta which was cooked really well and had amazing texture! There were pieces of chips that made it crunchy which I loved! The chicken surprisingly wasn't dry and the overall taste was good! This is something that I would reorder if I ever came back...  Unfortunately for my friends though they didn't seem to like their meal as much and they told they wouldn't come back and wished that we went to Spoon and Fork which is located right beside this restaurant. My boyfriend ordered a Chicken Quesadilla and it was placed on a salad bed with sour cream... but no SALSA... so when we asked the manager for salsa he said it doesn't come with it. My boyfriend asked very politely ""Is it possible if we can have salsa?"" The manager seemed really offended and said in a upset voice ""What's the magic WORD?""  Honestly I get it that he didn't say please, but it wasn't like we were a bunch of noisy and rude teenagers trying to cause any trouble. We were having a double date with old friends that we haven't seen in a long time and wanted to continue catching up. This guy should've been happy that we came to the restaurant to eat. I know it's not right to treat people in a bad way but like I said we didn't cause and trouble at ALL. Caught off guard by what the manager said my boyfriend just said ""please"" to make this guy go away and provide us with the salsa that should've gone along with the quesadilla.  Overall, I would never come back to place unless some one paid for me and I wouldn't recommend this place at all. This place is horrible. But I did like my pasta and those rolls. -CL",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-vaughan-2,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4

I also have a taste of couple of their offerings during Savour York Region Restaurant Week. Good if you like Tex-Mex food. Weekday Happy Hour and Daily Specials. Not a bad place to watch a game or just to chill with your friends.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-vaughan-2,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
18,Jeff S.,"Scarborough, Toronto, Canada",1,11,,1.0,2017-08-11,It doesn't surprise me this place closed down I was here with my family a few years ago and never again. The one thing that really stands out about this place was dealing with the manager. A paper clip is more useful then she was i really hope she sees this review because   I think that the job was to difficult for her there's always chucky cheese something little more your speed and you don't need a personality to work there. Perfect for you.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-vaughan-2,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
