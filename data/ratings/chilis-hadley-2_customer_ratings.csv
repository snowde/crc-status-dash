I wasn't made aware of this over the phone....and the soup size? They said they get a lot of complaints that their bowl looks more like a cup, so they gave me another cup, er...bowl, and sent me on.

We were staying at a nearby hotel and my husband and daughter wanted to eat here because they enjoyed it before. My daughter had the salmon and it was thin and dry as a bone. The ribs were cold.  I got the fajitas to go and ordered extra cheese and sour cream. The extras were literally a tablespoon amount. My husband went back and they gave him a hard time but eventually they gave him the extras of a decent size. Note, I ordered my meal online and the choice was the combo fajitas. I checked chicken 2x and got double the amount of chicken for the same price. Ordering it in the restaurant you get very little chicken.

14,Jessica C.,"Statesboro, GA",27,364,39.0,1.0,2015-07-20,"Two dinners here will be enough for all of eternity. In short, it was bad, just plan awful. Servers are actually not so bad, but there's obviously a huge disconnect between the front and back of house. The food is TERRIBLE!  First experience: Came in here with my in-laws for dinner after an event at UMass. Half of the food came out, the other half must have sat in the kitchen for a while because when it was finally brought out it had been literally crusted to the plate. Our server came over to check on it (food runners brought the food out) and she took it back without us even asking. She said her personal philosophy is that if she wouldnt eat it, dont serve it. Took some of the embarrassment away from my mother in law as her cafeteria-quality dinner was taken away to be replaced. I ordered steak fajitas- chicken fajitas were brought out. When steak fajitas were finally brought out, no rice/beans came with it. The hubs and his dad were finished with their meals by the time the two of us received our replacements for the ultimate fail of their first attempt. Good server, food tasted disgusting and wasnt worth the wait. They comped some of the bill without us asking, so I decided this mustve been an off night and that I would give them another shot.  Second experience: Stopped by Friday for an early dinner. We opted for the 2 for 20 with cheese (Texas) fries, chicken finger basket, and pork carnitas fajitas. The hubs also ordered some chicken tortilla looking soup- I forget the actual name. When his soup was brought out he was warned that it was SO HOT that it could burn him and he took his time with his first sip to find the soup was actually room temperature. He said it was so cold he couldnt even eat it. On to the appetizer. Cold fries with melted cold cheese and canned jalopenos- oh joy. It had obviously been sitting out for a while. Again we were warned how HOT the dish was to find that it was laughably cold. Entree time. The hubs said these were the most disgusting chicken fingers that he had ever had in his life- kinda hard to mess that one up. My pork was so fatty that I couldnt eat it. No rice/beans and the set up was a joke. A small app plate with a tiny scoop of sour cream, brown guac, salsa, and dryed up cheese. I made one fajita and felt sick before we even left the restaurant. Server went MIA so we decided to use the little check out computer at the table to pay our tab.  The second experience sealed the deal for me. There are some obvious quality control issues going on in the kitchen. 2 times is enough for me- wont be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hadley-2,1.5080000000000002,1.5080000000000002,1.5080000000000002,1.5080000000000002,1.5080000000000005

It took about 20min total for her to come over, pick up my salad, fight with me a little bit, then come back with a new salad that was mediocre at best. My boyfriend ordered a steak, which got cold waiting for my salad. It took an additional 10 min for her heat it up in the microwave; and when it came back it was black and blue.

Had to wait for our server to come back to bar to get butter.   Had chicken crispers...loaded with grease...did not seem to be cooked all the way.  Husband had a salad with clam chowder....took a few spoonfuls and left it...tasted fishy which meant clams were old and not fresh.  His salad was ok but nothing he would get again.  Had all these salad dressings but Italian.  Changed the menu again and not for the good.  Will be a long long long time before we go back...use to go to Chili's at least once a week.  Lost our business!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hadley-2?start=20,,,,,

There were no grill marks whatsoever and the mashed potato looked like it was microwave a little too long because it was grayish in color and already set. Mine was still blue in the middle and cold.

7,Madison C.,"North Reading, MA",0,13,9.0,1.0,2016-12-11,"My boyfriend and I were looking for a hearty late lunch/early dinner today and found ourselves here. I wish we had taken our business elsewhere. When we walked in, half of the restaurant was crowded. Several parties were ahead of us, but we were only quoted 15 minutes. Not too bad. The weird thing was half of the dining room was empty, but I figured maybe they were waiting on a large party or something. Finally, we were seated almost a half hour later. No waitress for 20 more minutes. Granted, I understand they were busy, but to let 20 minutes go by completely unacknowledged? Not even to take a drink order? Two strikes. The hostess came over, apologized, and said she alerted the waitstaff. When the waitress came over, she took our entire order at once (drinks, app, entrees) and presented us with dirty silverware that we had to ask to be replaced. I am a VERY patient and understanding person, and even I was getting peeved. Come on. Strike three. Food finally came out... all at once - app and both entrees. The waitress asked if we wanted her to keep the entrees in the kitchen until we were done with our appetizer. Thanks, but no thanks. Having the choice between eating both at once, fresh, or one after the other while one has been sitting around, I'll take the former (though we would have much rather she put the app in first and then our dinner so we could take our time and enjoy them.) I understand she probably was trying to make up for the wait, but we would have much rather she at least clarified with us before putting it all in at once. (Waitress was also using an open table to stack dirty dishes she cleared from various tables As for the food, queso app wasn't bad. For a ""spinach"" dish, though, you'd think there would be more than a couple of pieces in the whole thing. I enjoyed the salad portion of my dish, but the quesadilla wedges it came with tasted as though someone had made them an hour before - not hot. Kind of stale. Ugh. My boyfriend enjoyed his burger, though. It did look good. When we left, nearly two hours after we walked in the door, the empty part o the dining room was still empty. They could have easily sat people on that side and had the tables cleared in plenty of time, if they wanted to, in that time frame, I'm sure. So all in all, this was not a very good experience for a whole host of different reasons. Can't say we will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hadley-2,1.84,1.84,1.84,,1.8400000000000003

2,Donna C.,"Palmer, MA",82,4,1.0,1.0,2017-05-09,"If I could give this particular Chili's negative stars, I would. And, after reading the other Yelp reviews, I am just going to echo what everyone said. The food is great, just like any Chilis, but our waitress Erin was the worst I have had in a decade. We were on our lunch break for work. We are all managers and they are here on business.  Because the service was so poor, we were at Chilis for over two hours, which caused us to have to call corporate and explain why five managers took a two hour lunch. Not only was Erin super disrespectful when she saw our agitation at having to ask for items over five times, but she actually overheard one of our conversations and made a comment that she thought we called her ""stupid"" and it is a good thing we did not. My colleague was referring to his girlfriend being stupid and kidding around. Then, after the manager had to bring us items over three times, I had to go back and ask for our checks and to-go boxes twice because Erin was waiting on other tables and bringing out food to other customers. I was super hesitant to give her my debit card because I knew I may have to wait an hour to get it back. It was so bad that, after twenty minutes our corporate trainer had to physically go in the back and ask we be given our debit cards back and the check. Erin explained she had cashed us out already in an annoyed tone. If that is so, why would we wait 20 minutes for our checks. I have lived in Western MA my entire life and Chilis is by far one of my favorite restaurants. The one in West Springfield on Riverdale Road is AWESOME. So is the one in Springfield. I am shocked that Hadley could be so different and so horrible. I have waitressed in the past and I know how hard it can be and how difficult customers can be and I can appreciate that Erin was also bartending and working about 9 tables. However, we would not have had such a negative experience had Erin sincerely apologized, dropped the attitude, and been at all polite. Our trainer's sliders were raw but we were afraid to have to be in there for another hour and, since no one asked us how everything was, we never said anything. Erin did explain she is also a nurse so maybe she is burning the candle at both ends. I have worked in management since 1998 and if I ever had an employee act that way I would immediately call for their dismissal. You are your personal and professional brand, and the food could have tasted like it was made in a kitchen in heaven and it would not have mattered.  Her attitude, lack of sincerity, and ultimate inability to multitask and do her job left all of us needing ""to-go"" boxes because we were so disgusted.

We ordered the chips and salsa and upgraded to the table side guacamole like me always do, Dana roles her eyes and says you k ow that's the same as the house guacamole just $2 more. Yes it's the same but it's not as fresh and we like ours fresh. She may of just been stating the difference but she did so with attitude. We received our drinks and appetizers relatively quick. The food was good as always, but that isn't why I'm writing this review. The bartender was abnormally loud this evening, she was constantly laughing and yelling extremely loud. At first I thought it was another group of people only later to realize it was the bartender, acting childish and unprofessional. I bit my lip and ate my food. At the end of my meal when Dana brought us our check after listening to this bartender for over 45 min,Dana asked how everything was. I said ok but was a little disappointed in the bartender and how she was being unprofessional. She roled her eyes at me again and said oh she's just having fun. I then slightly irritated at this whole evening and my service, I said that if I wanted to listen to some one scream all night I would of stayed home and ate dinner with my little sister. She then gives me a fake appolagy trying not to laugh while she again rolls her eyes. Dana the goes the the kitchen and as I was getting ready to pay my bill I here her mocking me in the kitchen, followed by everyone in the kitchen. She returns with my box for my food looking at the ground as she walks over slamming the box down and running away with her head at the ground. I stated I wanted the manager. All the other employees ran into the kitchen including the bartender. The manager appears while everyone else is hiding in the kitchen. He wouldn't give me his name and repeated what Dana previously said about the bartender, they are just having fun. When in fact they were laughing at me. Only resolution I received was a free meal because he knew they were wrong and being assured the situation would be corrected.

5,Ajith J.,"Peekskill, NY",0,3,,5.0,2017-10-19,Wow! Honestly quite shocked to see some of the reviews as I did not seem to experience any of those problems while there. I took my girlfriend out to eat here and the older gentleman at the door whose name I cannot recall greeted us very warmly and showed us to our tables and went out of his way to make sure we were enjoying our experience. Our waitress did what she had to do and I wouldn't say anything bad about her either and the food was great like always just like every Chili's I have ever been too but the gentleman at the door whose name I wish I could recall made our day.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hadley-2,1.76,1.76,1.76,,1.7600000000000002
1,C K.,"Hadley, MA",0,2,1.0,1.0,2018-01-04,"AWFUL experience overall. I would not recommended this place to anyone. We were looking for a nice, easy place to watch a game, we sat at the bar and ordered nachos to start. They were a sad excuse for nachos, with barley enough sour cream for two chips and maybe a pinch of lettuce. Next we ordered a turkey club. The main reason I ordered it was because on the menu it stated that it had avocado. The sandwich came out without avocado. We brought it to the attention to the bartender and she brought out a side, but the side had four skinny pathetic slices with brown spots on them AND the plate was covered in orange filth. Additionally, it was dark as a cave in there. DO NOT GO THERE. We ended up walking to the Applebee's down the street in 5 degree weather just to get away from Chili's and their shitty stm",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hadley-2,1.76,1.76,1.76,,1.7600000000000002
