26,Kathy P.,"Kingsburg, CA",23,37,43.0,2.0,2012-02-16,"I love Chilis!  However, this one didn't impress.  We waited close to an hour to get any food at all during the lunch hour.  Our meal came before our soups and salads?  Very odd.  I also would have expected the waiter to acknowledge that it was taking awhile and apologize...but even when questioned about where our salads/soups were...no explanation....only that they were coming.   We were on a generous lunch hour and still ended up being twenty minutes late to the class we were attending. I would have felt better had they acknowledged the problem instead of giving us the cold shoulder. I tried a grilled chicken sandwich with avocado and it was just ok, kinda bland.  My fries were cold.  I loved the Chicken Tortilla Soup. Don't forget to get your free chips and salsa by checking in on Foursquare!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanford?start=40,2.184,2.184,2.184,2.184,2.184

Table behind me ordered and was finished before my wife got her sandwich and I got my burger. Horrible. And I understand the hiring pool that lives in the central valley. You're gonna run across a few larger than normal women... But can't Chili's authorize a more flattering work uniform for these women?  The typical skin tight polo is kinda gross when the person wearing it weighs more than an NFL linebacker.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanford?start=60,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116

32,Ann M.,"Anaheim, CA",95,253,2.0,2.0,2013-05-20,"This is obviously not Chili's flagship restaurant.  When my boyfriend and I walked in, we were quickly brought over to a booth and the hostess put the menus down and immediately walked away.  The booth was very dirty though  - trash all over the floor under the table, crumbs all over both the tabletop and the seats -- so much so that neither of us wanted to sit down.  Since the hostess had long abandonned us, we tried to move to the empty booth directly behind us...except that booth was worse so we went back to our original booth.  Several employees walked by or were within seeing distance but no one even acknowledged the issue let alone came over to help as I cleaned off the table and seats with one of the napkins on the table.    My boyfriend ordered queso dip and chips for us to start with our drinks - he had a beer and I got a margarita.  The drink menu lists lots of different margaritas but doesn't list any prices so I should have known better or at least should have been smart enough to ask because I wound up paying $10 for a meh margarita made from a crappy mix.  Oh well.  The queso dip and chips were pretty good but the chips are weirdly thin.   For our entrees, my boyfriend ordered a burger and I tried the chicken crispers.  He was happy with his burger, and I thought the chicken crispers were ok but rather greasy.  That said, I knew I was coming to Chili's so that was really the kind of food I expected.  The service (starting with the dirty table) was seriously lacking.  Our waitress was nice but a little weird on the verge of annoying and would disappear for long periods of time so what was meant to be a quick dinner for 2 took over 2 hours.  When we finished our entrees, our server took them away and then came back with an unsolicited check, but we had wanted to order dessert.  My boyfriend was worried that ordering a dessert to-go would prolong our stay by another 30 mins but I foolishly sad ""no way! just order it.""  Unfortunately, he was very accurate.  In sum, our visit was long, dirty, and disappointing...there's a simile joke in there somewhere I just couldn't think of it but feel free to come up with your own.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanford?start=40,2.56,2.56,2.56,2.088,2.56
90,Jaclyn M.,"Porterville, CA",7,2,,2.0,2013-06-08,"So yesterday I went to Chili's at 7 O'clock to meet my sister for Dinner and I wish I would have gone somewhere different. Yes we went on a Friday night so obviously there would be a wait so not a problem, thought I would go and sit at the bar and eat there rather then wait for the dining room side however there were 3- 6 tops and 2- 4 tops that were GROSS, food was not bussed from the tables or wiped down the bar top where the alcohol was siting was dirty and the floor was gross. I asked the hostess if I could sit in the bar section and she said it was first come first serve however they expected the Customers to sit at unbussed tables filled with drink and food from previous customers. DISGUSTING and a health violation also! I asked if she could have one of the 6 tops that didn't have food on them wiped down before I sat there and she said NO!?? seriously so after that I decided to just wait for a table in the dining room section. It was about a 10-15 min wait not bad. Arrived to our table and it was clean however our menus had food on them...(it takes a couple seconds to wipe them down) our waiter he was ok got our drink order fast and then was tentative with coming back to check on us to see if we were ready to order, got our order in and then for being as busy as it was it came out pretty quick. But HOWEVER once our food got delivered to the table he was not very attentive other waiters brought us items he forgot. My sister ordered the Taco Pizza and I had the new Guacamole Burger with a wheat bun and black bean burger with sweet potato parm fries to sub for reg fries. the food came out and although my dish didn't look the best it had an explosive flavor that I was not expecting it to have except they forgot the parm.  With my sister Taco Pizza she had no complaints. Overall, wasn't happy with the staff and how they handled the bar area. The place was dirty but the food made it all worth it.

Even the toppings didn't help the taste. All of my coworkers complained that their meals were so-so as well. The biggest disappointment was when I ordered dessert to try to make up for the poor meal I had and that was not that great either. I ordered the cookie in the pan with the ice cream and that was not good either. The cookie had a weird after taste.

The hostess explained this cool techy menu/ game devise at my table. The food was really good. I got a mexican combo with a crunchy taco with chicken and a cheese enchilada. The beans were really good, too. They were garnished nicely with diced tomatoes. I have to say I was impressed with the freshness and quality of the food. I haven't been to a chili's in years. Maybe even 8 years because I haven't enjoyed the quality in the past. Chili's could improve on their timing. I waited more than five minutes for my server to greet me. Once I ordered I think I waited about 20 minutes for my food. It made me wonder if the server forgot to put my order in. The server was very friendly and helpful.  Chili's has definitely moved up in the pecking order of chain restaurants in my book.

I have never had a good visit here.  THE SERVICE IS TERRIBLE!!! I have had nothing but problems at this Hanford location.  I went tonight with my boyfriend for my birthday and the waitress we had included help from another waiter. We ordered an appetizer to share and a meal to share as well. When we received our meal my boyfriend was trying to tell her that our fries were not the ones we ordered and she interrupted him and said that she was sorry she just threw them on there and that our Texas fries were in the window and she was going to get them right now. FIVE minutes later she comes back saying that they will get us fresh fries the ones they were going to give us looked like crap. Before she left my boyfriend could get 2 words out to ask for a plate she left! She walked by us one more time and my boyfriend tried to call her again to get a plate and she just ignored us, he got up and kept saying ""excuse me"" and then the bartender noticed that he wasn't getting thru to her asked if he needed anything so he asked the bartender for a plate.  The waitress came back and my boyfriend took her aside and let her know nicely that she had interrupted him multiple times and let her know that he understands that she's working and we're not the only customers in her area she was VERY Passive-Aggressive towards him and then some customers approached her and asked for their change she was very nice to them and gave them their change and said and i quote ""I'm sorry, apparently I've been interrupting"" to them. We told her to take the burger back and to give us our check. She was still rude to us and gave us our check for the appetizer we got. We paid with chili's gift money[$20 but our check was only $11.48] that we received from our last time having chili's because of a previous time we had horrible service and our order was wrong.  I have never ever been treated the way we have tonight and cannot believe that people like that are working in the food service industry when they clearly cannot! THIS HAS HAPPENED TO US MULTIPLE TIMES I'M SURE WE'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES!!  I will tell everyone in Hanford about my experience and let them know that there has not been 1 time out of the many that I have been there where it has been good. **My BF spoke to the manager in Visalia [Scott] and he was very helpful listened to everything that he had to say [w/o interrupting] and said that he is going straight to the district manager...So THANK YOU SCOTT IN VISALIA**",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanford?start=40,2.56,2.56,2.56,1.956,2.56

Let's see if anything has changed.  We were greated promptly and seated in a timely manner. It's wasn't very busy so go figure. The server was pleasant and got us our drinks. On the table was some kinda iPad?  U got me. The server never bothered to tell us abt it. After messing with it I found u could order and pay ur bill. Wow what a concept. Except I'm sure some one is now out of work due to the self serve format.  So we ordered. I got the Smokehouse Big Mouth Bacon Burger and my wife got some Mexican enchilada dish. Which she loved by the way.  The burger was very good. However where the hell was the bacon!? Dam they used to put two big ass slabs of bacon on this thing. That's the whole reason for ordering it.  Yea there was some bacon. But paper thin and not what it used to be.  Never the less. I have to say it was tasty and I did enjoy it. It was nice and messy the way it's supposed to be. I see these lame assed reviews abt how a burger was soggy and all that BS. Hey dumbass. A juicy burger is gonna be messy and the bun might get soggy.  Would love to give Chilis 4 or 5 stars.

When my family and I first started coming here it was great I would say in the last 8 months it's went downhill.  Last time we were there we had the most forgetful server in the world. Drinks took 15 minutes to get out. We asked for a side of sour cream to go with our chips and salsa. 20 minutes later we finally get the chance to ask again about it. He obviously forgot. Ok so we're waiting and waiting.... Finally 45 minutes later the manager comes out to apologize that the pasta is taking awhile to cook and that is the delay in our food (I'm not dumb I know the server forgot to ring it in). We asked her if we can at least have our salads we ordered. She brought those our promptly. 10 minutes later we finally ask the host to have them just to put our food Togo cause it was getting late. No problem. We get home, daughters hungry. Go to get her food it's not there. Looked at the receipt and our very forgetful server never even rang her food up. This was the third time in a row getting horrible service so why did I go back today? Well the manager left me some coupons so I thought I would just do Togo order. Not much better.  Got online to place my Togo order. Did all my modifications for the burgers asked for salads etc.....  My email stated it would be ready at 12:04. Cool that was easy. Get there at 1205. There was a lady ahead of me that had already been waiting. Shortly after my arrival a gentleman comes in and waits. Long story short we were all there an additional 25 minutes. Finally get the food when I realized they game me fries instead of salads so once again had to wait for the salads.  Get home and what a disappointment. My Togo box was all melted obviously been under the heat lamps for awhile. I asked for extra mayo for my husbands burger.... Had none! My burger was so cold and the bun was hard (from being under the heat lamps for so long) that I had to get a different bun from home and put the whole thing in the microwave. I asked for no onions... What did they do pilled them high. There were no homemade pickled like they promote and to top it off..... My bacon was not even on my burger it was off to the side. They obviously forgot to even put it on there. Oooooo let me tell you the gentleman that was also waiting for his Togo was MAD!  You probably wonder why I don't call and say something, what good would it do.

The fried pickles were practically inedible. The brine from the pickles was already salty, and it was covered in a salty batter. We could not eat those. We received a platter of chips and salsa. The chips were decent, but the salsa tasted like tomatoes straight from a can. No flavor. Our entrees took a while to get to us. Turns out, the server forgot to input our entree order into the system. When we did get it, it was ok. We both ordered the quesadilla lunch combo. While the quesadillas were ok, they desperately needed a dip. We didn't receive one for our meals. The only reason why I'm giving this place two stars was because our server was so kind and helpful.

Can't believe someone was paid to design it.  The staff is always helpful and my ice tea never ran empty. Good choice for a lunch time meal.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanford,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8

Wasn't a huge fan of chilis until I started going to this one, the servers are very attentive, the prices are right, and the atmosphere is great. Would definitely recommend to anyone in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanford,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92
8,Dominique S.,"Vacaville, CA",0,12,11.0,2.0,2017-07-28,"Went to Chili's for a family dinner and I was not impressed. I was actually disappointed. It took almost 45 minutes for our food to come out and half of my party didn't receive there food for another 10 minutes. I ordered a simple meal, loaded potato soup and a house salad. Soup came out room temperature, and the salad looked like someone threw it on the floor and pick it back up and put it on the plate. Hopefully they were just having an off day and that the service isn't like that all the time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanford,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96

5,Spoon Z.,"Hanford, CA",0,6,,1.0,2017-09-14,"I have been to this place about 5x or so and each time was not pleasant. Unfortunately it was the the wait staff. At one visit the bus boy was actually taking care of us because we were being neglected lol. Every Time I went it was not my idea, but rather what the majority decided. Last time I was there we ended up leaving after about 15 mins of sitting there without anyone coming to get drink orders, and this was in the bar on down time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanford,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8
3,Julie L.,"Visalia, CA",101,10,3.0,1.0,2017-09-19,"Poor Service in the bar. Ordered bottomless soup/salad for lunch. Waitress brought both at same time, never refilled my water cup, never asked if I wanted refills on soup or salad. The only time she returned is to give me my receipt. I was the only female at the bar amongst men. The men were catered to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanford,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
6,Jay M.,"Galt, CA",19,62,,5.0,2017-11-02,"Went there tonight for dinner. We were greeted at the door, seated right away. Our server came right away and got our drinks. Took our order, food came out cook to order and hot. She checked back with us several times, very friendly. The ribs fell off the bone, very tender, will definitely order them again. Had their chips and salsa, one of my favs. Overall a great experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanford,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84
4,Rocio M.,"Reedley, CA",0,2,,1.0,2017-11-26,"Food was below average. Service was horrible, our waitress Amanda was horrible we had to ask for silverware and napkins on several occasion before they were brought out to us. It wasn't even a busy night and everyone seemed so rushed and like they could care less. Definitely will not be coming here again thanks to subpar service even from a chain restaurant",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanford,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68
