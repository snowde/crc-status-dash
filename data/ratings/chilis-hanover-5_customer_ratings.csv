30,Ma-e M.,"Baltimore County, MD",0,1416,571.0,3.0,2012-04-25,"I was hungry and ready to eat, but later to find out that Chili's is inside the mall. The restaurant does not have their parking space. Unfortunately, at this mall, parking is hard to find. The AM mall is big but the ratio of mall goers to parking lot is not enough to accommodate the county's population. Chili's food is not really my kind of food. Because I have to walk farther at the state that I was in, I felt Chili's gave a chill for a nacho chips, etc...; the food I can't remember was not enough to keep me adjusted from my uncool attitude.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanover-5?start=20,2.7,2.7,2.7,2.7,2.7
33,Mick G.,"Baltimore, MD",0,1,,1.0,2012-05-28,"Since this is a chain restaurant, my review will be based on their service. The food at Chili's is relatively good and it's pretty much the same at every location. My girlfriend and I came up to the host's booth. One of the hostesses came up to the booth to pick up a menu for someone that was already seated. She looked at us and didn't say anything. Another hostess came and sat us down. We were seated and checked out the menu. We noticed no one came to our table for about 5-7 minutes. By that time, we were ready to order our drinks, appetizer, and meal. No one came to say, ""I'll be right with you"". My girlfriend said, ""I'm going to give them 2 minutes and we're walking out."" So being the geek I am, I set my sportswatch for 2 minutes. Low and behold, our server came and my timer went off simultaneously. Our server says, ""Oh my, how long have you guys been sitting here?"" We told her about 7 minutes tops. She apologizes. My girlfriend didn't want to stay. Since she just beat the timer, I gave her a chance to redeem herself. Big mistake. Our server didn't seem to want to redeem herself. I was hoping to hear her say, ""well since you guys we're patient, I will take off the beer or appetizer off your bill."" She didn't do anything to make up for her mistake. She didn't give us plates with our appetizer. She didn't refill our waters.  We just decided to pay for our meals and only tipping her a buck and some change. blah. ...on to the next.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanover-5?start=20,2.436,2.436,2.436,2.436,2.436

Drinks are as good as the bartender. I usually stick to margaritas, which are way better than Chevy's around the bend. Their food is much better than I expected. I really enjoy their salads at lunchtime. Lots of food for $10.

Mix drinks were ok but not the greatest. If this place wasn't so expensive I would have given it a 3 star review but they want to much for the quality of food.

32,Kamilah K.,"Baltimore, MD",166,192,127.0,4.0,2013-04-16,"Piggy-backing on the Element hotel review, 4 friends and I went to Chilli's too. The line was long but luckily one of my friends spotted an area parallel to the bar. We bypassed the line and sat down within 2 minutes. I'm sure some people were mad but it is technically a bar area. Note: that space is small, so if you are clumsy (like myself) be careul not spill your drink on your self (like I did). .I ordered the BBQ burger with a veggie burger and the mac and cheese in lieu of fried. The burger was kind of dry but it was good. The presidente margarita helped. That margarita was great. I felt buzzed in no time. I cannot comment on how long the food took since I had to run into the mall for a new pair of pants. The pricing was reasonable and I would come back for a causal hangout.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanover-5?start=20,2.768,2.768,2.768,2.768,2.768

Quality of food, portions were big, the food is spicy, (for me it was, for my wife it wasn't) The apetizers were very nice, I recomend the western spring rolls. my burger was ok and my wife's, food (bbq ribs) were ok also.       Service. The server was a very nice young lady. but what I like the most is that the manager was going from table to table to check on the customers and thank for coming in.

25,Mike C.,"Howard, MD",0,164,,2.0,2014-02-17,"We ate here on an early Sunday afternoon and things started off on the bad foot.  There was a line of people waiting outside of the restaurant, but no hostess.  Was the place simply packed?  No.  After 10 minutes, a lady behind us in line went to see what was going on.  When she returned, she reported that there were plenty of empty tables and that she asked a server to get someone to start seating customers.  A hostess eventually appeared and people were then quickly seated.  As we were taken to our table, I noticed several un-bussed dirty tables near ours.  It took an additional 10 minutes for someone to finally come over and clear those tables. Our server was efficient, but not enthusiastic.  She was there to bring refills, but not around when we needed the check.   The food (which we really enjoy at the Eldersburg location) was disappointing.  Our flatbread pizzas - potentially excellent - had too much of the ranch-like sauce and were quite salty.  Our basket of fries were overcooked and just warm.  Our son's quesadillas were not good.  They were soaked with oil, like a well buttered grilled cheese, and the oil tasted old.  When the waitress asked if he wanted a take-out container for the 3 of 4 unconsumed quesadillas, I replied ""no"" saying that none of us liked them at all.  She ignored the comment, saying she'd bring just the one box for my daughter's Kraft mac and cheese. Each table has a tablet-like device for ordering food and playing games.  It's all too easy for kids to start games that cost money (about a buck).  Even more reason not to talk to your family during dinner.  (The family next to us:  The young boy was on a cellphone, the young daughter was on an iPad, and the one adult was playing on Chili's tablet.)  It allows you to ask for refills, order dessert, and pay your check, when, all too common in places like this, your server is nowhere to be found.  We paid using the tablet and left without having the server thank us. Overall, Chili's has a good menu, but the execution here was not good during our visit.  It seemed to need an adult manager presence to get things in shape.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanover-5?start=20,,,,,

I would post his name but they wear no name tags here. But he is the only guy here with braids and earings. As we stood there we were not acknowledged as he walked out to smoke.

21,Kimberly B.,"Ellicott City, MD",2,3,3.0,1.0,2015-11-23,I give this Chili only one star.  If I could not give a star that would be great!!!  I was served by Lauren M. (#69).  I sat at the bar and asked for a golden margarita.  Lauren the bartender looked confused and snapped and said what and rolled her eyes.  So I politely gave her the ingredients for the cocktail.  I explained that I wanted Grand Marnier and not the normal Cointreau.  She acted as if she did not know what Cointreau was this was puzzling as I bartend myself.  She gave me the drink.  As I sat at the bar and was 1/2 way through my drink I flagged her down for my receipt as she seemed overwhelmed.  She again rolled her eyes when I asked for the receipt.  When she returned with the receipt she slapped it down on the counter with a bit of an attitude.   At this time I asked to speak to a manager.  He came and I explained what had transpired and how I was taken back by her attitude while serving me.  He offered to refund my bill of $10.89 which was not what I was seeking yet he proceeded with the refund and spoke to the bartender at the register while processing my refund. As I am finishing my drink the Caucasian female patron sitting two bar stools from me engages in an audible conversation with the bartender on how blacks are always running scams and I just wanted to get over. At that point I no longer wanted the rest of my drink!  I immediately got up told the manager about the conversation of that had transpired and told him I would be reporting. So here it is!!!! Ironically this is not the 1st time I have received awful service here.  Just a year ago I reported this same location to the health department and corporate.   Quick Synopsis: Placed a order of mashed potatoes corn and chicken.  Plate came to table with 2 sides of corn on the cob...told waitress and she takes her hand picked up the corn off my plate with her bare hands and proceeds to carry it back to the kitchen. Stick a fork in me...I was done...floored. I learned my lesson to never go back here...EVER.  Any establishment with such poor customer service and racist comments from staff will never receive my money again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hanover-5?start=20,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96
