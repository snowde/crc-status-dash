0,Shary A.,"Kansas City, MO",176,219,1118,3.0,2015-02-15,"I am not originally from Arecibo, PR but when i saw the Chili's sign at the entrance of Plaza del Norte i decided to go for it. I had a bit of difficulty locating the Chilis (most restaurants like Mugs and Ponderosa are located outside the actual mall but in the vicinity of the malls parking lot). So when i found the chilis inside the mall (next to Faccio),  i went to sit at the bar area which was empty (except for one guy)..... on a thurday..... around 430pm. Had this been a Chili's from Metropolitan area, the bar area would be packed. So i order the Margarita Presidente (which was good) and the special of the day which was the Cajun Chicken Pasta for $7.99 This is not what i was craving ( i actually wanted the salmon with mashed potatoes and corn on the cob OR the Quesadilla Explosion Salad) but it was what was on special and i was ravenous after such a long day. I don't think i would order the cajun pasta again... it tasted fine but didn't wow me and the portion looked way smaller than on the menu or smaller than when my mom orders it on a normal day (when it isn't on special). I finished the whole thing and wasn't FULL.  I did however enjoy the delicious garlic bread that came with the meal, the good service and would probably return.  By the time i left at 5:30pm there were only 4 more couples that came into the bar area. So if you want to eat at the bar area with a couple of friends or even alone on a weekday afternoon, it's safe to say you'll find a spot at the bar area. I can't say the same about weekends though because i have yet to return to this Chilis to experience it on a weekend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hatillo,,,,,

We went on a sunday and the waiting time for families with stroller was inconceivable.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hatillo,,,,,
