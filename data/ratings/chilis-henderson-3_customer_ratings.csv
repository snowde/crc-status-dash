122,Karen R.,"Henderson, NV",32,14,9.0,4.0,2012-04-08,"Rarely, if ever, disappointed in this Chili's. Good food, fast service, and everything you expect from this well-known chain.  Never too crowded and rarely a wait, ever. I take off one whole star because it is FREEZING in this place and not just one time.  Every time I eat here, I freeze.  I and friends on several occasions have gone to our cars and gotten sweaters and coats. Also, the partner servers are kind of silly.  Just give me one person so that they will actually remember what I asked for.  It makes it a super causal dining experience having multiple waiters. Last night, had a delicious Raspberry Presidente Margarita and they left the shaker with quite a large drink..... all for under $8.  I'm sold by that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-henderson-3?start=120,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997
132,Christine M.,"Las Vegas, NV",94,147,456.0,4.0,2012-04-16,For the past month we have made this a after soccer game dinner routine since my daughter's games were at 3:15PM so we are there around 4:30-4:45PM.  The staff are WONDERFUL.  We got great service from the greeter to the Waiters and their helpers and the food was delicious.  We like that it is kid-friendly with a very impressive kids menu but also has the food and drinks for the adults too.  I only gave 4 stars since three of visits were in the evening and I would have given 5 stars but this past Saturday we had an early game and the server at lunch time had no personality what-so-ever.  Luckily they had a balloon guy working the tables and that was perfect to entertain our daughter. The next two Saturday games are early so I am keeping my fingers crossed we will get a waiter with a better personality.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-henderson-3?start=120,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997

I have been to chilis in 2 other states and the servers always come out to give customers their orders.

No happy hour on the weekends, and by the looks of it, they shoulld change that policy, the place was pretty empty.

113,Allison S.,"Las Vegas, NV",325,243,671.0,2.0,2013-10-23,"I haven't been to Chili's in a while. I usually love it, but this past Sunday my Mom and I went and it was bad! From the service to the food. All of it not good! We started off with the bottomless chips and salsa. This was the only good thing about the experience. I also checked in on Foursquare and noticed I got a free bottomless chips and salsa with check-in I asked our waitress about it. She had no clue about it at all. She even said that she had never seen it before and had me read her off the coupon code. The chips were surprisingly light and very tasty and the salsa was pretty fresh.  For lunch I decided to have their new Bacon Avocado Chicken Sandwich. It came on a pretzel  bun, with tiny bits of sauteed onion, very none existent cilantro pesto mayo and fries. It looked really pretty and looked like it was going to be really yummy. Alas, I was wrong. So very tasteless! The whole thing just had no flavor and needed some serious sauce. I tasted none of the mayo at all. Even the fries tasted bad.  My Mom ordered the Southern Smokehouse Bacon Burger. Again, it looked really yummy and was huge, but was flavorless. She also said it was mushy in the middle and the ancho-chilie BBQ sauce was not on there at all! When the sever brought us our food we asked for a couple of sides of ranch for our fries. She said no problem. I ate half of my sandwich and had given up on the ranch and was using ketchup before we finally got our ranch. Both of our fries were cold by the time it came and then it wasn't even our server that brought it to us!  Chili's you disappointed me. From your servers to your food: meh! I feel I totally wasted my money and time! I should have just gone to Rachel's Kitchen where I know the food has taste and is yummy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-henderson-3?start=60,2.8240000000000003,2.8240000000000003,2.8240000000000003,2.8240000000000003,2.8240000000000003

First walking in there was no one around to greet you.  We stood there for 20 mins. They claim there are so busy but they have plenty of empty tables. Took forever to get someone to take our order. After our food came out no one came back to refill our drinks or give a check. I had to wave down a different server just to get our check. This is horrible service.

The chips/salsa to start is my favorite, warm and I love restaurant-style salsa, (try the salsa ranch!) Mango tea is a must, and they have great mixed drinks, too! Awesome margaritas!

128,Patrick B.,"Austin, TX",1209,73,32.0,1.0,2014-05-05,"I usually come here since I live in Anthem and service has been great but this last time it sucked. It was beyond horrible service. We got sat and I asked the hostess about the little tv on the table and she said you can re order drinks on it, play games and pay the bill. I said oh you can order food and she said no obviously I wouldn't give you a menu for that umm...okay rude! Secondly, our server greeted us with such a fake smile and fake hello. He was clearly annoyed with his day and job. He was probably like oh shit two olderly people and a young guy means my tip will suck. I used to work in the service industry and you can never judge a person on their age or looks like you can't judge a book by its cover. He was annoyed to that he could not upsell all of us but hey when your rude I won't add a salad even if I want it. He sighed as he took our order and walked away. Really?!? I know it's Chili's and all not a fine dining restaurant but still I shouldn't get treated like I'm at Denny's. Really almost with the trivia its an extra 99 cents seriously lol?!?! At Buffalo Wild Wings it's free to pay trivia and it creates a fun family experience not let's pay for it. I'm so annoyed I'm sitting here taking the time at the restaurant to write this review. So, we shall see when I get our food how the server will be with our order. So, we ordered our food at 12:00 and are still waiting....and its 12:15....I would expect a longer wait time at a busy restaurant but it's completely empty. Finally, got our food at 12:17 and omg servers need to realize when they are being sarcastic and rude. Our server did not care at all about anything and seemed annoyed. I just find it hilarious that a server is so busy with 5 tables. Really it is not that hard to handle 5 tables. I honestly don't think I will be returning to Chili's ever again. I'm tired of getting horrible service and servers who hates their jobs. If you hate your job so much then find a new one. End of story. It always amazes me how some people have jobs in the service industry.  Also, I get the tv ideal trying to be cool but that just means the servers are really lazy and need a electronic device for people to hit refill my glass and order deserts haha lazy work. Then really we had a free desert for my grandpa's birthday but our server said we only get a free scoop of ice cream. Seriously......so frustrating it's annoying!  Never coming back to any Chili's for that matter! You lost my business and you are horrible and customer service and I don't feel horrible about writing this review at all. I would rather go to Mcdonalds in the same parking lot and I would probably get treated better and I hate McDonald's.  I never eat there hahaha",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-henderson-3?start=120,2.88,2.88,2.88,2.6600000000000006,2.88

We've had several different items on their menu such as queso dip, fish tacos, fajitas and sliders.  Everything has been tasty and piled high.  I always leave full without room for dessert.

We were seated promptly and it took almost five minutes for our server to come over and greet us. She took our order since we had long enough to look over the menu in her absence.  Before our food came, she informed us it would only be a few more minutes which was nice. Our food came and our waitress came right after and asked us if everything looked ok. That was the last time we saw her until it was time for the check. We came here with a kids eat free coupon and our check was wrong so she had to go fix it. She came back and apologized and told us it was so busy because of the coupon. That's funny because there were several open tables near us. I don't blame the waitress though, is one falls on management and not having enough staff to accommodate more people during busy times or when a coupon is put out. I don't understand why it is so hard to get decent service in restaurants. We are not high maintenance at all, but expect our drink glasses to never go empty, is that too much to ask?

41,Bonnie P.,"Henderson, NV",217,601,120.0,2.0,2015-03-31,"This Chili's offers up some of THE worst customer service I've ever experienced. It's a chain with decent food but the service makes it such an undesirable spot.  Often times there is no one to greet us when we arrive. We waited a while tonight to be seated.  We've had issues with two meals in a row and the manager NEVER addresses the issue or attempts to correct it. On one occasion, during a lunch break, my husband ordered a burger without mustard. It came out with mustard once. When he gave it back the first time, they returned the same burger and bun with the mustard literally scraped off. The second time, it arrived with new lettuce, same bun, same burger. The third time, new bun; same burger with mustard scraped off. What's so hard to understand about ""I really don't like mustard, may I please have a new burger?"" Manager never came over, and by the time all this went down my husband had to go back to work. He was starving and the only resolution was to take the burger off the bill.  The most recent time we ordered pre-dinner salads and the meals came out without them, and also without my side. I think it was the manager who was running the food and, when we told him we ordered salads his only response was, ""Oh, do you still want them or I can take them off the bill.""  Two stars because they have a pretty decent 2 for $20 menu that includes an appetizer and two entrees. I love the margarita grilled chicken. When we're not doing the 2 for $20 dinner, my husband loves the quesadilla explosion salad. The food is reliably good and the prices are decent but the service ruins the ENTIRE experience.

I also asked for cheese on my fries and she took the time to explain how they make the fries and that they would come out on a side dish because they run them through the oven.       We got a nacho for an appetizer and as the manager was bringing it out Charlene was right behind him with drink refills.       When the food came, everything was hot and fresh and I liked the way she didn't run off, and asked the right questions to make sure everything was right.      There has been a noticeable upgrade in the staff at this location.

Now, don't get me wrong, I understand this is a corporate restaurant that is more franchise like. I did not expect a Chef Ramsay meal, but I still hoped for something flavorful, and at least a clean restaurant and for service to be present. I heard that kids eat free on Mondays, Great! My toddler loves to eat and this was something that made me decide to go try it out. She was recovering from being sick, we all wanted somewhere casual to eat. I called first because I didn't want any confusion when I arrived. The hostess (I am assuming. I suppose it could have been a bartender or server) answered and said she would check (with her manager) and get back to me. She came back on the phone and said yes, kids eat free with an adult purchase not only on Mondays but also Tuesdays and Wednesdays as well. Great. We drove over, arriving to eat about 15-20 minutes later. Ok, so let me say I am not a health inspector or the Queen of England, but a big red flag that made me want to turn around immediately was when we walked up to the doors and both the outside and inside doors and walls had dirty fingerprints all over them, dirt, and dried food. They were not busy inside, there were maybe 4 other tables with guests. We were seated. The booth was sure to great me dirty as well. ..and my silverware.. you guessed it. Not clean in appearance. I told my husband I wasn't so sure I wanted to stay. He wanted to. A server (young man) greeted us and asked what we wanted to drink. I asked him (again to confirm) about the kids eat free deal, as we looked over the menu. He looked totally confused and said he doesn't know. I asked if he could find out. He asked another server. She said she does not know and isnt sure. They asked what if we were ready to order. I kindly asked if they could find out for me. They went and asked their manager and came back to report the manager said ""no"". I stated I JUST called and it was confirmed, not only for today but for 3 days. ""um. do you know who you talked to?"" then they just stood there awkward. One server went back to talk to the manager again and came back and said the manager said he has to have a code or number. The manager hid in the back and never came out once during this. I asked for a minute. They hovered. I told my husband with the service and overall cleanliness I wasn't too sure about staying and since we are all going to buy meals anyways I would rather try somewhere I know we love. He did not want to leave, as he was hungry. Fine. We decided to order an app and some entrees. I ordered the char grilled steak. (It was to come with asparagus, cherry tomatoes, homestyle fries, and a sauce side). Well let me tell you, my steak came out and was not ""char grilled"". My sides were cold microwaved broccoli, and mashed potatoes (if you want to call them that. and I love mashed potatoes. I couldn't force them down, my daughter wouldn't eat them). I am assuming the server brought the wrong dish or the wrong sides. No one came back to check how the meal was. I only saw someone come over to ask if we wanted to pay via regular check or at the table. She did ask if we wanted dessert. I am not sure where the first server we had ever went.

81,Ashlee B.,"Henderson, NV",0,16,1.0,2.0,2016-03-26,"When we went it was still happy hour (I only know because the little table top computers were telling me). When our waiter came over we ordered two beers. She asked if we wanted large or small, we said large. When she brought our drinks they were both rather small but before I could even ask if these were the large ones she fled from the table. Once she finally came back, sometime after, we ordered our food. When she brought our food, she had forgotten half of it and come to find out she never even put the order in! She never apologized, never said ""I'm going to get that out for you as soon as possible"", nothing! She just said ""oh"" and left for another 15 minutes. By time she brought the other half of the order we didn't even want it but yet again she was nowhere to be found. When we went to just pay our bill because we were over waiting, our beers weren't even on the happy hour price!!! Rather than trying to track her down, we just said screw it, paid the bill and left. What I noticed was: 1. Our waitress never wrote anything we ordered down. Clearly she couldn't remember it all so maybe she needs to start to ensure better customer service and correct orders. 2. They think that because they have these table top machines where you can pay, they never have to come to check on you.  I will not be returning. I understand this isn't ""fine dining"" but after a long day when you just want a nice cold beer and some quick food, you also want quality or kind customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-henderson-3?start=80,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.8240000000000003,3.2800000000000002

114,Evelyn L.,"Henderson, NV",34,51,15.0,1.0,2016-06-19,"Sad. The service was poor and the food even worse at this location. We were immediately seated as it wasn't too busy and then after that it was downhill. The drinks took 15 minutes from the minute our request was taken. The appetizers were taking so long we were given chips to for the time wait. The appetizers finally arrived and they were just ok. For my entrée I ordered the tacos platters from the fajitas menu and the tortillas were cold and hard. My husband and daughter got ribs and seemed content. As I started to eat my meal I pulled a thick black hair out of my taco which I was already eating, luckily the server was right in front of me and she was shocked! I was disgusted. She immediately offered to have my plate remade and I said ok as to not ruin my family dinner. Everyone finished their meals and I still waited for my plate. When it finally came, I was just skeptical and couldn't enjoy my food, and alone at that. I just wanted to leave. My youngest daughter needed to use the bathroom and I took her and was just beyond disgusted by dirty walls and bathroom stalls. It was below any average standard. Just terrible. Then we returned to our booth as I saw the kitchen. I saw all this food on the floor and a bunch of lazy employees just walking on, over and around it. Like can you please sweep. I asked for the check and barely touched my food after. To no surprise I saw the check and was billed for my mediocre meal Im shocked I wasnt also charged for the hair in it. I felt like I couldn't pay and leave quick enough. I'm so disappointed, this is my local Chili's and I don't expect I will ever return or recommend this place to anyone ever.

A couple people came in before us and got seated as fast as the host can seat them. Our turn comes, we get a table right next to the door. The issue i have and why this place is getting 2 stars, is because it took us 15 minutes before deciding to leave.

No, 'have you been helped, your waiter will be here shortly' etc nothing. 2 of them were in the very end of our section whiping down tables and talking . Were they one of our servers?

Then when paying the bill on the electronic thingy, saw that we'd been overcharged for the chili (it was supposed to be $3.99 with the purchase of an entree, which we did, but the charge was around $5). Alerted the server of the error; she said she'd fix it, but never came back to tell us when she'd done so. After waiting a while, started over on the electronic payment device and this time saw that the price of the chili had been reduced, but to only $4.

The food was eh and the service was spotty.  We were adulting and came in sans children.  Seated in the bar area in a booth.  The waiter was quick to ask and obtain our drinks.  We ordered our food..... It took what felt like 15 minutes to get our appetizer.   I will say that the Texas fries no jalapeño were tasty.  Our main course were the problem.  After drop off, wait staff disappeared for an extensive period of time.  I got the chicken fajitas and it's hard to mess them up.  There was no where to put the fajita down except the sizzling pan.  Husband asked for side of mayo and ketchup, but didn't happen.  After about 10 minutes of husband getting progressively pissy, I walked up to the bar and ""borrowed"" the ketchup.  The bartender came up then and asked if we needed more ketchup, as the bottle was limited.  I said yes. Then magically the waiter returned and we got drink refills.  Husband never did get the side of mayo.  And his bacon cheeseburger was so greasy he didn't finish it.  (We are talking about a man who NEVER walks away from food.).

I ordered the beef enchiladas which comes with rice and black beans while my friend ordered the bleu cheese chicken crispers with corn and loaded mashed potatoes. We also ordered chips and salsa for an appetizer. I know chips and salsa may sound rather boring but their chips are always great; they're on the thinner side and always arrive at the table warm. Paired with their skillet queso (which we skipped on this particular trip) there's no beating them! Our food arrived quickly and was hot. While we both enjoyed our meals, my friend said that his corn on the cob tasted off, almost sour.
