57,Michael K.,"Miami, FL",142,23,16.0,1.0,2012-05-14,"Like someone said, it is located in Hialeah. Food is great but aren't very prompt with it. I went for lunch quite a couple of times and always forget to bring the soup.  The MAJOR reason why it gets 3 stars is because I swear it's my luck, when I order water everyone  you can taste the detergent used to clean it which renders the water undeniably bad to drink. Undrinkable.  Other than that Bar service is great and when the waiters aren't having bad days it's a good place to eat. UPDATE: 10/12 Bar patrons are some of the most socially awkward people ever. This place is a dwelling for the weak, and a cesspool of hate and disgust to fellow patrons. Really weird. This place doesn't get my business anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hialeah-3?start=40,2.212,2.212,2.212,2.212,2.212

The service is meh... at best. I think that is what would need to stand out the most so that the dinner could be remarkable in a chain restaurant, this is definitely not the case here.  We were a rather large party, 7 peeps. Two entree's were brought out. One of which was being shared by two people. The rest of us were left to watch them eating because it took another 50 minutes to bring out Fajitas for two and a half-rack of ribs and fries. I mention the food because these are not anything special.  Did I forget to mention that at 9pm when the mall closes, if you are lucky enough to be seated in the bar area, you will be locked in Alcatraz style.   All in all, if you're in the mood for Chili's don't come hungry and if you are hungry try some place else in the mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hialeah-3?start=40,2.316,2.316,2.316,2.316,2.316

61,Natalie L.,"Hialeah, FL",107,61,,1.0,2014-07-21,"Chili's has always been one of my favorite restaurants. When they get it right, their food is great and you can't beat their delicious 2-for-1 margaritas. THIS particular Chili's, however, needs to be put out of its misery once and for all (Along with the Miami Lakes location). Each time we come here, there's a different issue. Just last Sunday actually, I met a friend here for lunch. Our waitress brought us our food and literally vanished for like 20 minutes. We wanted more drinks and some doggy-bags, but didn't know who the heck to ask. Finally, we asked a bus-boy where our server was and he told us, ""Oh, they tend to disappear"". Well, that's comforting. Finally, we closed our tab on the little ""Ziosk"" tablets they have now and asked another waitress to please give us refills before we left. As we walked out, we saw our waitress walking back into the restaurant with a bag from ""Champs"" shoe store and she didn't even acknowledge us, when I said, ""Oh, hello"". This woman literally left her tables & went shopping and didn't tell us anything. We were dumb-founded. This isn't the first time I have a bad experience at this restaurant. I've come here a lot, just because it's close to home and I can shop and grab a bite right after. While I have had some okay experiences, the bad really do outweigh the good here. Opt out of this Chili's. Drive a little further to the one in Miramar and your experience will be 10 x's better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hialeah-3?start=60,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002

The food here is consistent with other Chili's Restaurants. The restaurant is a tad smaller than others but, no big deal.  I have no complaints about the restaurant itself, however, I do with Chili's the company. See, by placing those kiosks at the tables, the ones you pay from and do some limited ordering from, you have 86ed one important part of a dining experience, e.g., customer service. Sure, she took our order and explained the kiosk but, that is it. No ""how is your meal"" nor ""do you need anything else."" Nothing but how to pay at the end or flagging our waitress down for a refill. Sorry, I like it the old way with Human interaction.  Other than that, though, it's your expected Chili's.

She gave herself a 20 % tip...I thought that was a pretty ballsy move and should of asked for the manager but decided against it.  This waitress is untrustworthy and I would bet she does this consistently to customers.  Check your bill.  I am sure she also charges customers for her friend's drinks.  I am upset that I did not get her name.  If this ever happens again I will be contacting corporate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hialeah-3?start=60,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44

42,Naysla R.,"Miami, FL",56,19,7.0,2.0,2015-03-30,"This is the worst service I have ever had in this location. I arrived at 4:20pm with my best friend and my son (a total party of 3) & the wait was estimated  at 20min wait. As I noticed people were being seated, who arrived after I did, I approached the hostess and asked her how much longer because I saw multiple parties being seated whom had arrived after me. She then said I had 3 people in front of me. I stated that made no sense because everyone currently sitting in the lobby had all arrived there after me. She said ""well that's impossible because I have your name written down."" When I look, I saw it said my name with a party of ""4"". I asked why is it 4, when I'm clearly 2 adults and a child, she said ""well I don't know I saw 2 kids"". I was seriously taken back at how rude and unproductive she was. I waited, & saw two more parties sit down. At this point it was a 40min wait and I didn't even recognize the people around me I asked for the manager, since the hostess was incapable of actually helping, explained to him the issue. He proceeded with stating there's call ahead seating. What does call ahead seating have to do with the fact that I was there for 40 min and everyone who was arriving after me were being seated? He states ""no mam..u arrived at 4:40pm"" i was like ""no i arrived at 4:20pm"" & When I look at the list myself, my name had been scratched off from the TOP of the list as if I was already seated. Mind you, I had been sitting NEXT to the hostess the entire 40min & not once was my name called!!! Then of course I was next to be seated. All the way in the back, in a dirty booth. I had to ask the server to please sweep the floor and clean the seats because it was disgusting. Thankfully the server was nice and the food was fast. Until dessert. We ordered their new cinnamon skillet with ice cream. Yeah, more like an oversized Cinnabon. It looked nothing like the picture. & Def didn't taste how we expected.  Overall, I give this Chili's 2 stars because of our server. If it were based on the incompetent hostess, it would be one star! Look over resumes when you hire people! & if they cannot handle the pressure of a high volume day, please do not schedule them to work!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hialeah-3?start=40,3.08,3.08,3.08,2.504,3.0800000000000005

Wish they had more of a craft beer selection and maybe some local Funky Buddha's but maybe one day. The food is good, I've had almost everything on the menu, my favorite is the turkey burger with guacamole. For appetizer we get chips with salsa and guac. Sometimes we get the appetizer that combines three different items. The service is sometimes great, but when they're busy, some of the kids that work there get really sloppy. This past Thursday we went in at 9pm and it took for ever to get our drinks and appetizer. Our second round never came. We just paid the check and asked for a box to take left overs. If there's something this particular restaurant needs to work on is service. I understand things can get hectic, but no one should be slamming drinks at your table and walking off without saying a word.

11,Marilyn Y.,"Miami, FL",370,185,1243.0,1.0,2016-03-30,"I did a little shopping with my mom and my mom's friend and we were hungry. I didn't want anything from the food court. My mom wanted Chili's and I'm  not really fan, because of my past experiences at other locations.  The vote was in and Chili it was. We got there, we were quickly seated and menu were available at the table. I ordered fish tacos it came with a side order of cilantro rice and black beans.  My mom ordered a Mexican beef bowl and my mom 's friend ordered grilled salmon with  fries and side salad. Food was out within 15 minutes. The fish tacos looked very tasty. But when I bit into it, it was appealing at all. No limes were given and I had to call my waitress to bring some over. After heavy squeezing of limes, and some salt and pepper, the taste did not improve at all. I ended up eating one and the rest went to the garbage. I could've made better tacos myself and seasoned. My mom's friend plate, I looked at it and I snatched it away,  I told her not to touch it. I quickly called my waitress and she called the manager.  The fries were warm and they had a very stale taste to them. The salmon was very pink and it looked like it never touch the grill. I told the manager that the food was unacceptable and the plate did not looked no way appealing.  I asked for a more grilled salmon and steamed broccoli instead.  The second go round was better.  At the end of the day, the only satisfied customer with no complaints was my mom. She cleaned out her plate. The manager never returned to ask if everything was better? Way to go Chili 's. Food is very bland and their menu fell off the map years ago for me. I personally would are McDonald's and probably would've felt more filling. I'm glad I was able to use the tablet to pay for the meal and fill out the survey. I pretty told them how I felt about the food and its presentation. Chili would not be seeing me anymore,  I don't care if free food was being given away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hialeah-3,2.8,2.8,2.8,2.2760000000000002,2.8

So we ordered the trio of appetizers to share (egg rolls, cheddar bites and boneless friend chicken bites in the honey chipotle sauce). I was very hungry and eager to discover Chili's as my coworker loves it and told me a lot about this restaurant. Appetizers were really good. Then, I got the enchiladas. Couldn't finish the rice, beans plus the enchiladas. The food was ok but I got disappointed by the enchiladas. Even I wasn't hungry any more, we decided to get the hot cooked cookie with the vanilla ice cream.. Ufff.. one week after I still have the taste of this desert. That was awesome! The service was not good. The waitress was forgetting our sauce requests, she was not reactive. We got bad luck also because we were seated next to a group of drunk coworkers that were shouting. I will give it a next shot and try a salad next time",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hialeah-3?start=20,2.88,2.88,2.88,2.38,2.88

I was tired from work and decided to give this location a chance once again as I have had bad experiences here in the past. I ordered the usual, steak fajitas well done. The kitchen mgr/operator not sure what he was brought my food rather than my waiter. I asked very nicely if I could have them ""cooked a little bit more"" and He replied, very harshly ""they're well-done, do you want them burnt?"" I thought it was a joke but definitely not.  After getting treated that way I lost my appetite and asked for it to be taken off the bill. I spoke to the mgr and he insisted, but no thanks.

I'm so fucking mad, the bee fucking bit me and then the waitress picked up my red apple and started biting it and chewing it in front of me, then she spit out the juice of the apple and told me to rub it on the sting of the bee. I got up to leave and the chef came out of the kitchen and threw a knife at my wife's neck and murdered her. When I tried to run out the host broke a bottle on my head and I ended up in the god damn mother fucking hospital.

It is always a crowd here since the next closest chilis is on 57th avenue. Our food is out in about 10-15 mins after ordering which is a good time considering the amount of customers being served.  The food comes out fresh and hot everytime, the most I've waited to be seated is 15 mins. Seating arrangements are comfortable and you don't feel as though you're packed in a tight space. That's one reason I have made this chili's my regular spot, because I hate being seated in a cramped restraunt. It is located inside the mall so that is one reason for the location being busy.

However, I have noticed that the quality of the food has steadily gone down.  I almost always order the steak fajitas when I go. So I can attest to the fact that the quality, particularly in the steak, is steadily going downhill. Plus, the sides that come with the fajitas are lacking. On a related note, the last time I ordered a chocolate molten cake, it arrived at my table with the packing material on the bottom! It was really nasty.  The old adage always remains true, though: you get what you pay for. You can't really expect top-quality food from a casual restaurant, plain and simple.

I know the prices aren't that high but between an appetizer, drinks, and two entrees the check was more than $50 and you can eat a LOT better with $50.  My biggest issue was that everything that was brought to our table was cold. I ordered the half rack of ribs and apart from also being cold, they only gave me 4 ribs. I also dislike the metal trays they're now using for food. It looks nice when you order a big plate of food, but I ordered half a rack of ribs and mashed potatoes.
