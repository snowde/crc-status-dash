3,Todd A.,"Hingham, MA",0,16,6.0,1.0,2012-01-11,"The food here is terrible.  The only item I used think was ok were the burgers.  The last time we went, they had a whole new menu so I was tricked into trying something other than the burger.  Big mistake.  I had chile.  Very watery with almost no meat.  I sent it back after 2 spoonfuls.  My wife got the fried chicken dumpling things which used to be okay but they were full of grease and we sent those back as well. The bar is nice for a drink and they make great chips and salsa so if that is all you go for you should be fine.   I think all of the food is created elsewhere and frozen and they heat it up.  That is how it tastes.  If you have to order food try the burgers.  They used to be good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hingham,,,,,
2,Alyson S.,"Holbrook, MA",9,3,,1.0,2012-02-22,"I really do love chili's despite the fact that it's a chain. Love all their food and drinks!! HOWEVER, the bartenders and wait staff at this particular chili's are exceedingly rude, disrespectful, and act like you have inconvenienced them by showing up at their restaurant. Even the manager spoke in a condescending way when asked to speak to her. All of the staff's behavior was so absurd that we had to send a letter to Chili's corporate office explaining the situation at Chili's in Hingham.  I would absolutely go out of my way to tell anyone to never visit this Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hingham,,,,,
5,David Y.,"Weymouth, MA",0,48,6.0,2.0,2012-06-03,"I know, it's just Chili's but still it's pretty bad. Haven't been to one in years but pressed for time I went with my wife and daughter recently and got pretty much grossed out. First it took about 12 minutes before a waitress even came over to greet us, she was nice enough but 12's a long time especially when the place is near empty. Anyway, the food eventually comes and the chicken in my tacos looks like it was made last year. Dry, cold, and tough. Oh well, it's just Chili's and we are pressed for time. Maybe the rice will save it. Hmm, not bad...what is this basmati? Hm, I'll take another tas- hello. What's this, then? A hair? Too short to be any of ours, and way too black. Oofa. Waitress is really apologetic and says she'll send the manager over. He eventually makes his way over and says ""I understand you had a problem with your food?"" Awesome, I get to relive it by relaying it to him. ""I'll take that right off the bill for you."" Cool, I don't have to pay for hairy rice. My wife and daughter's food was serviceable but everyone's appetite was kind of shot, thinking about some half-balding cook back there losing his hair. I didn't think I won the restaurant lottery, but maybe a free drink or dessert might've lessened the disgust. Guess we'll make time the next time to try some place else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hingham,,,,,
1,Shannon S.,"Quincy, MA",95,295,8.0,2.0,2012-10-23,"Though I don't regularly go to Chili's, I've been a time or two and generally speaking, have been satisfied.  However, my first Chili's takeout experience was disappointing. I ordered dinner from this location on a weeknight, Monday or Tuesday maybe? And we selected the ""dinner for 2"" option. This included 2 entrees and an appetizer. We ordered two different fajita dishes and the guacamole starter. The guacamole was already browning when we opened it... clearly not having been made to order or perhaps even earlier that day. I know guacamole turns brown, I understand the effects of oxidation, but I expect my guacamole to still be green from the time I leave the restaurant to the 10 minutes it takes to get to my house. Maybe the avocados weren't even still good when the made the guac, I don't know, all I know is I WANT GREEN GUAC! Sorry for yelling. The fajita dishes tasted fine, were even pretty good, but the portions were so small. And for almost $15 a pop, (the dinner for 2 saved us some money -- but if we had ordered them off the regular menu) the portion sizes were unacceptable. I assembled 2 smallish fajitas and didn't have enough to use my 3rd tortilla. The chips and salsa were good -- I've always had a soft spot for Chili's salsa, maybe because in college it tasted so good with beer? But it was fine and I probably would have been happier with a meal consisting solely of chips and salsa. I probably wouldn't have gone here if I didn't have a giftcard to burn and I probably won't go out of my way to go back unless it's just for happy hour beers and bottomless chips and salsa (which you actually have to pay for.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hingham,,,,,
