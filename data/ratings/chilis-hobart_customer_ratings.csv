27,Eric A.,"Manhattan, IL",10,147,10.0,3.0,2012-04-23,"Just your average Chili's.  The food was what you would expect.  I got the bottomless lunch (soup and salad with chips and salsa.)  The chips and salsa were excellent, the salad itself was great and was pretty ""fancy"" (for Chili's anyway)  The only problem was the ranch dressing was watered down considerably.  It even had consistency of water.  The broccoli cheddar soup was good but didn't come with the pico de gallo on top that I've gotten at any other Chili's location.   The waitress started off OK but then failed at the end.  She disappeared for at least 10 -15 minutes and left us waiting for more soup and chips.   The cool thing is if you don't need anything else and you're paying with a credit card  you can pay right at the table using their wireless terminal located on each table.  Your receipt even prints out the bottom.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hobart?start=20,2.0600000000000005,2.0600000000000005,2.0600000000000005,2.0600000000000005,2.0600000000000005

Regardless, no complaints about the service I received and the food was great!  This place also has fancy electronic computers at each table. You can let your kids play apps, look up the menu, pay your tab, or read up on news headlines (as I did).

11,Kayla M.,"Sedona, AZ",438,237,832.0,3.0,2013-04-11,"You'd think you'd pretty much know what you're getting when it comes to Chili's - but would you be surprised when an 'entertainment fee' shows up on your bill? I was. There's nothing special about this particular Chili's location. It's what's you'd expect. It's clean, it's always reasonably packed and the menu is updated frequently. Our waitress was very nice - big plus, but shortly after we were seated a large group of loud women were seated across from us which set the tone for dinner. My girlfriend and I both ordered Salads - she the Santa Fe Chicken Salad and I the Caribbean Chicken Salad. You can never go wrong with a salad here, they are all good! My friend didn't expect the spiciness of the Santa Fe salad but remedied that by asking for a side of ranch as well. When the bill came we were shocked to see a $.99 charge listed as an 'entertainment fee'. Okay sure, there's the saying ""but shit it was 99 cents"".. so call me a cheap-o, but quite frankly I wouldn't say there was any entertainment provided, if anything it was obnoxious ambiance. We inquired about it with our server who explained they have handheld trivia games on the tables that you can play while you eat. If you play it you're automatically charged $.99 for it. Okay that'd be fine, if we'd had one of these so called games on our table but we didn't. She removed the charge from our bill and all is well. But who knew? Note to self: always check your bill before paying... even if it's only 99 cents.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hobart,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997

They said ""Chili's"", I said ""Ok"" mainly because I really like their Americanized fajitas and they used to have the boneless buffalo wings which were awesome, not sure if it's still on the menu as I did not order them this time around... As it turns out my boys like to come here for the little machine that they have on each table, kind of cool as it has all sorts of apps that they can use ... also you'll have to pay a 99 cent charge to use, no bid deal as they get to sit and play games - you can also look at menu items and pay your bill using the machine as we did. Ok...service was good (prompt and checked-in several times as we ate), restaurant was well-maintained (actually pretty sure they did some upgrading both outside and inside) and the food was also good - we had chicken tenders, burgers, and some sort of chicken chili dish that my wife really enjoyed ... of course, we had dessert and it was good...vanilla ice cream covered with caramel on a warm skillet - it was good.   I rate it above other Chili's I've been to...Enjoy",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hobart?start=20,2.16,2.16,2.16,2.16,2.16
26,Dawn R.,"Chicago, IL",0,15,6.0,1.0,2013-06-29,"I was greeted by a host who was sweating profusely. I mean sweat was dripping from his face.  After he wiped his face with his arm/hand, he picked up the menus with the same hand and handed them to us.  I was immediately disgusted.  This place was filthy.  There were dead flies in the window, the window sill that I rested my arm on was sticky, the menus were crusty, and the bathroom was in need of repairs. My empty appetizer plate was dirty.  When I walked to the bathroom, I saw the kitchen...the kitchen floor had food spilled on it and the staff was just working around it. Actually, it appears the place is in need of a total wipe-down.  Why can't the franchise owner spend a little $$ and clean up/repair the place? My husband even commented on these conditions.

18,Gerry H.,"Naperville, IL",64,262,22.0,3.0,2013-07-11,"We ate here at the conclusion of some meetings in the greater Valpo area. And although I would normally give any Chili's a wide berth, I wasn't the decision maker this time, and I had a pleasant experience. The hostess was cordial and of good humor; she joked around with us and set a positive mood.  The service was good, but I think there was a problem in the kitchen-It took a really long time for the food to arrive. I ordered the California Turkey club.  The turkey had a processed lunch meat quality (or lack there of) but it was tasty.  And the fries were piping hot and very nice.   I like the addition of the fancy electronic device, the Ziosk, at every table.  Especially because you can pay your bill with it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hobart,1.9640000000000002,1.9640000000000002,1.9640000000000002,1.9640000000000002,1.9640000000000002
13,Leslie L.,"Schererville, IN",64,366,371.0,3.0,2014-02-27,"Went there today for my birthday and I would have given this review a photo but my mom was already mad I had my phone out to do a tip about the iced tea!  The server was nice enough. I ordered unsweetened tea and the server said they have blackberry and a mango tea. They are not sweetened... But then I mentioned that I am diabetic and she said the syrup has sugar. I looked it up online and it shows there are 20 carbs in the glass. Pop has more sugar but still 20 carbs does not an unsweetened drink make!! We ended up ordering 2 steaks. My mom requested medium well 6 oz and mine rare 10 oz (the only way to eat a steak, sorry)! When we got our food I knew right away it was wrong. I was told to cut it open. I've had enough steaks where I can tell you the way it was cooked just by looking at it.  Mine was overly done and I was told that I ordered a medium well (ewww) and I told her I ordered rare. My mom confirmed I will not eat a steak unless it's practically still mooing. The waitress told me to keep the steak so at least I had something to eat while waiting. My mom's 6 oz looked better so my mom took my 10oz flavorless cardboard and I took her 6 oz with some flavor. They brought me a 6 oz rare steak to make up for it... They charged us for a 6 oz and a 10oz which is what we had ordered but my mom was supposed to have a 6 oz. and me a 10. I know technically they left the 6 and brought me 6 so I had 12 oz... But only 6 of it was what I wanted to eat.  I took the rest home because someone will still eat it.  I know the waitress was trying to help by getting me a 6 oz rare steak and leaving the overlooked brick with me but that isn't really what I ordered. I know this review might seem silly but I'm serious about my steak, today is my birthday and I just wanted a good steak since I cannot have any cake today (I'm diabetic and my blood sugar is off TMI) I must say they didn't have a problem substituting more broccoli for me instead of mashed potatoes and the broccoli was cooked wonderfully. *** also on another note the bathroom was a little dirty looking and the toilets are so close to the floor I almost fell over.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hobart,1.9320000000000002,1.9320000000000002,1.9320000000000002,1.9320000000000002,1.9320000000000004
30,Nicholas W.,"Chicago, IL",38,12,,1.0,2014-10-13,"Looking to have a decent meal while trying to enjoy a beautiful fall afternoon, myself, a family and friends party of seven, were in the vicinity of Hobart's Southlake Mall, which is flush with chain restaurants of all types and a few independents. Most of them were full up customers on a Saturday late afternoon, with wait times before seating and service pushing well over an hour. We were about to drive to another municipality when we noticed that the Chili's restaurant didn't seem that crowded. We didn't really consider why. A vote was taken on what we should do and the majority vote - myself in opposition - was that we should go to the Chili's rather than wait an hour or more to eat. So, we parked, went inside and inquired as to the length of the wait. We were told 15 minutes. We waited, and waited, and waited - over 45 minutes, all while watching other groups of 5 or less be seated and observing a number of larger tables open. My spouse approached the maitre de and asked if we had been overlooked. She responded that there were no openings and that we would be next. By this time there were moans and groans among our party, my daughter starting to become ill (she requires nutrition due to a medical condition).  My wife mentioned to the staff that there were tables available where they could accommodate 5 plus adding two more chairs, rather than allow others to go before us who had not been waiting as long. The maitre de refused to respond, choosing to send a waitress - of the same race - to placate us. This was not about that - it was about poor service. We continued to wait into the first hour, determining that we might as well stay because we would have to start all over again somewhere else. Finally, after more than an hour wait we were seated - mostly at the insistence of my spouse. Once seated, it was another 15 minutes before a waitress provided us with a menu and the table had not been bussed, but was still dirty with grease and food refuse left by the previous customers. Our assigned waitress finally took our order, but did not provide us with table utensils, napkins and took her time giving us water. When we finally got our appetizers, we STILL had to wait a full 35 minutes before our entrees were served - and then she ignored and did not put in one particular entree order, did not provide the order of one of our party for another 30 minutes! We ended up sharing our entree and appetizers with a member of our party because her meal was still being prepared (we believe it was not put in with the main order). Obviously we complained, a manager appeared and offered a reduction in our bill, but refused to take off the ""late"" entree which our group member was forced to put into a carry-out container because of the late hour and the time we had already spent in this restaurant. This is the kind of service - or lack thereof - of which comedies are made. Had I been a comedy writer and produced this scenario for amusement, no one would believe that this kind of thing had actually taken place. The food, by the way, was certainly not the best. But by that time it was simply a matter of having something to fill the void in one's stomach. I wouldn't eat at this place if it were the last place on earth - or any other Chili's establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hobart?start=20,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003

31,Dan L.,"Elmhurst, IL",79,10,,2.0,2014-10-22,"My two friends and I arrived at this location on Tuesday, October 21st at about 12:20. The restaurant was not at all crowded by any definition. Despite this, we waited about 10 minutes for someone to come to the front to recognize us. Despite the bartender being in perfect view, he didn't acknowledge our presence at all or inform any waiter that we were there. After 5 minutes of waiting, my friend sought a waitress to ask if we were supposed to seat ourselves. She said we should wait. It takes another 5-7 minutes for someone to come up to us. Even during busy times, there should be someone at the front to take care of the customers. This was not a busy time, and we and the other party who came in after us felt very unwelcome due to apathetic glances from the bartender and other waitresses. The waitress who seated us was surprised no one had helped us and was kind and apologized. We asked to be seated in her section, and then a different waitress came to take our order. Waitress no. 1 came back to take our order, not realizing another waitress had taken our order. I understand being part of the waitstaff is not easy work and there is much to keep track off, but this service was very much below average. I give the experience two stars because the ability to use the table computer to pay/leave tip was convenient, and allowed us to get to our work in a timely manner after having experienced delays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hobart?start=20,,,,,

32,Margaret A.,"Dyer, IN",41,9,1.0,2.0,2014-12-12,"I know it's a chain, so you expect to get chain type food and that's fine. This was a joke! The beef nacho appetizer was really good. Dinner on the other hand was ridiculous! I ordered the southwest chicken salad. This is an $11 salad! No problem if you actually get a decent salad. It was about a half cup of lettuce and about 5 small chunks of chicken!! Not even a half of a split chicken breast!!! There was supposed to be avocado on the salad. There was 2 small slivers on the salad!! Ok fine, it is what it is, but wait.......once I fished out the brown rib parts of the head of lettuce, you know that stuff you pull off the head and throw away before you actually get to the edible part of the lettuce, I was left with maybe a quarter cup of lettuce for $11. So the server came and brought me 3 more paper thin slivers of avocado to make up for the scrawny disaster. The turkey club my other half had was about as ridiculous. The bread was 2 inches thick probably to make up for the fact that the turkey was that cheap pressed turkey crap you can buy for $1.99 a pound at the deli. Also not worth the $10 this bread overloaded sandwich cost. Let's not forget the 4yr old hand sized fries it came with. Maybe 10 whole French fries in the whole order. $40 meal and we are both scrounging through the fridge a half hour after returning home from dinner! The server was really nice though, it's not her fault this cheap regulated food is over priced and way under sized!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hobart?start=20,,,,,

Food is always good -- love the chips and salsa. Sometime skimpy on condiments (especially if ordering fajitas). Three stars is because the service is hit or miss.

My family and I had the worst experience at this Chili's.  While the mediocre service and food would have been tolerated, everyone has their bad days, the Saturday night manager's actions made matters worse. On top of having a very unprofessional appearance; he had a very incompetent and lackadaisical attitude.  He acted as if he could have cared less my family's experience in his restaurant and basically ran, away from our table before we could make a full complaint.  He did make the excuse that our server did not feel well, which makes me wonder if I now have to worry about becoming sick from this visit.

This Chili's has been on a downward trend for many years but it has hit the bottom. The restaurant is dirty, the plants are dusty the wood blinds have dried food stuck to the slats and the upper blinds are dusty.  The washrooms have not been remodeled or the stall doors repaired for years. They do bandaid repairs as needed but the shoddiness is evident with holes in the walls, cracked and broken floor tiles. But management should keep the washrooms clean.

I can't imagine why anyone would want to run a restaurant of this poor calibre. I tried sitting at the bar since it was just me and they seemed to be pretty slow in the bar area. Now I know why, the bartender is miserable. And that may be an understatement. I had to send my order back twice because it was wrong (once was her fault for putting it in wrong because she didn't write anything down as I was ordering and the second time the kitchen left something off of the plate). The second time she went back to the kitchen with my order I heard her sigh very loudly before notifying the cooks. That was it for me, I didn't want the order, I just wanted my check for the salad and drink that I had. She asked me if the food was still wrong I said no (that was a lie because the food was cold). The manager came out and she was very nice and understanding. But nothing she could say nor do would make me stay in that place at that point.

So, after the check in we were seated at a sticky, dirty table that was cleaned but cleaned poorly and so aged that I'm not sure if it will ever look clean.  This is one of the locations that have been in business a long time but has never been updated to my recollection and if it was it's time again.   The food.  The meals were decent and our server was pleasant.  The corn wasn't fresh or just wasn't a good batch and the fries weren't real warm but the burgers, ribs and main courses were all good.     The bottom line is that with all the restaurants in the Merrillville area this one is one to skip unless you really love chilis for some reason.   Enjoy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hobart,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24

When in the Region, I always ask my elderly aunt, where would YOU like to go for lunch, that your husband or son won't take you? She chose Chili's. We arrived early for the lunch period and stayed, chatting, for almost two hours. That's my first plus for Chili's. The waitress did check in on us occasionally, but even though the restaurant got very busy, no one gave us the bum's rush. We were able to sit and talk for an extended period without being bothered. My Aunt eats typical American Midwestern food, and she ordered a chicken sandwich that came with a side of fries. I am vegan at home and vegetarian on the road, so I was very pleased to see that a black bean burger was available. Mine also came with fries. We both really liked the French fries. They were sprinkled with black pepper and served in a clever metal version of a fries bag. The meals were very good as well. Chili's was a good experience.

My water had floaters in it and I couldn't deal with it but it took her another 10 minutes to show up so I could tell her. She brought out our soups and that was when I told her about my water. She left and about five minutes later showed up with my water AND our food. We barely had made dents in our soups. When I took a bite of my tacos, they were luke-warm. My mother in law received the wrong food but (surprise) couldn't find our waitress to tell her about the mistake. She was actually gone for most of our meal. Never once came to check on us and my mother in law had to flag down another waitress to ask for a water. When our waitress finally appeared, my mother in law asked HER for a water since the other one didn't bring one, she shook her head no and proceeded to play on her phone. After 15 minutes she finally shows up with the water and got an attitude when we weren't super grateful after waiting for it so long for it and asked for the check.

7,Jassi J.,"Chicago, IL",3,17,3.0,5.0,2017-03-23,"I've been coming here since I was 14! I stopped for a while, because service became crappy.. I guess they're under new management because the staff members are super friendly now, the service is fast and the food is amazing. Try the white spinach queso, trust me!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hobart,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28
6,Rebekah V.,"Crown Point, IN",7,15,,1.0,2017-04-28,"Was told 15 min. for a party of eight. Waited 45 minutes, watched some employee walk around seemingly aimlessly with an iPad in front of her face, watched two booths side by side not filled for 15 minutes..... ended up walking out and going next door to Red Robin, which was much more accommodating and didn't have iPads glued to anyone's face.

5,Jeff D.,"Cedar Lake, IN",38,62,34.0,1.0,2017-07-24,"Saw the fajitas advertised on Facebook and they looked delicious.  I havent been to Chilis in awhile so I thought I would go.  Decided on the chicken and steak fajitas.  Was I surprised when they came, I should of took a picture to show the difference.  I got like 7 small pieces of chicken and 7 small pieces of the chewiest steak you will ever eat.  The picture they advertise shows a huge portion of steak, chicken and shrimp.  Now for our waiter, he took forever to bring us our first round of dri ks which would of been ok if they were busy but they were not at all busy.  Ordered the endless chips and dip apparently they are endless because he never brought us our secomd helping of chios and dip.  Refills on drinks had to be asked for twice with the waiter.  All in all a pretty bad experience at Chilis, I think you can do alot better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hobart,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08
4,Crystal H.,"Cedar Lake, IN",36,16,8.0,1.0,2017-09-30,"We ordered two ultimate smoke house combos & southwestern egg roles. My husband was missing his jalapeño sausage, both of our ribs were cold, there wasn't any corn on the cob(which is listed in the description), the egg rolls were greasy and gross, overall the food was just pretty terrible. We live less then Two miles from this location- there's literally no way the food would go cold in such a short distance- so they knowingly sent cold food home with us. Spoke to Jamie- she was relatively useless. Sending us the equivalent of a chili's gift card....the down side to not taking back the food is that now we have to give them one more chance to use the gift card being sent to us. Going forward we won't eat at this chili's location. Bad service, bad food, wasted money. Save your time and cash and eat anywhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hobart,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08
1,Rob R.,"Valparaiso, IN",1,31,,2.0,2017-11-05,Been there a couple times and I wonder why I go every time. Nothing against the waitress and waiters there. They have always been solid and nice. However the food is ok.. At best.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hobart,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04
0,Asja D.,"Chicago, IL",278,84,232.0,5.0,2017-11-12,"Andrew rocks! My boo and I were in Crownpoint, IN from Chicago for a lecture and decided to grab a bite to eat. We arrived at Chili around 9:55 pm and we thought Chili's was winding down for the night but it was surprisingly popping. From the moment we arrived, Andrew welcomed us graciously. We asked the server if we could get a booth and she said let me just check if there's any available and Andrew just happened to be passing by at the moment and heard our request and stated that there's an empty table by his side. While we waited for Andrew to clean off the vacant table, three different servers came up to us on three different occasions to ask us if we have been seated or if someone was tending to us. I was pleasantly surprised by how kind and attentive all the employees were considering that all of them had a couple of tables to take care of. It didn't take Andrew long to clean the table and make us feel right at home. While we viewed the menu, Andrew dropped off forks and knives and asked us what we would like to drink. Within minutes we got our drinks and we were ready to order. I don't eat pork but I ordered the bacon chicken ranch quesadilla but I asked if it was possible to remove the bacon and Andrew said ""absolutely"" but in the most sweetest and accommodating tone.  He also was very conscientious of the ""no pork"" comment I made that when my boo ordered the 1/2 pound Texas cheese fries, Andrew noted that it came with bacon and asked if we would like it removed. It's those type of details that make the distinction between a good waiter and a great waiter, thanks Andrew. I've never in my life had better service- our appetizers arrived super fast and within minutes, our main entrees arrived even quicker. I mean they were quick! I got the chicken ranch quesadilla which was so good- the chicken was well cooked and the cheese was just enough- not overly cheesy. The only complaint I have is the rice, it could have been cooked longer- it wasn't that well cooked but somehow it was crunchy- not sure how that happened. My boo had the margarita chicken but instead of the beans, he substituted for broccoli. He says it was really good but he also commented that the rice was a little off. Overall, we were so stuffed from the appetizers that we didn't know how we could possibly finish the meal. Andrew kept coming back to check on our table and see if we need anything else. I was super impressed by the hospitality of this place. We got to-go bags and we were able to pay for our tap using their desk appliance at our booth. Andrew and two other servers thanked us again for our service and we walked out. Honestly, top of the line service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hobart,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12
