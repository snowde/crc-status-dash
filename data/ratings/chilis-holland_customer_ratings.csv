7,Marge F.,"Toledo, OH",0,9,1.0,5.0,2015-02-12,"It's finally open!!  After months of waiting, I was finally able to visit my local chili's again. And I'm so glad I did.   From the new layout to the staff, everything was great. The food was hot and delicious, our server was attentive (but not overwhelming so), and it was an overall great experience.     I will go back for the potato soup any chance I get, and I'd recommend the same for anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-holland,,,,,
13,David M.,"Findlay, OH",0,3,,5.0,2015-02-13,"I visit Chili's whenever me and my wife make a trip up to Holland, Ohio to shop at Sam's Club.  It's been over a year since I've been back because of the fire but tomorrow we're going to make the trip and I'm looking very forward to it.  This is my favorite place to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-holland,,,,,
12,Garrett G.,"Parkton, MD",3,31,,4.0,2015-04-23,"This location previously burnt down, but they rebuilt it and I have to say it's very nice. The service was great and the food was excellent. Will definitely be going back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-holland,,,,,
8,Aubrie B.,"Elma, WA",151,41,11.0,1.0,2015-08-09,"Very slow service, waited for almost an hour for one entree that my husband and I were sharing. No discount offered for our long wait from our waitress. And to top it all off both my husband and I have food poisoning. It's too bad because the updated restaurant looks great but with terrible service and some (now) obvious food contamination issues...we won't be going back or recommending this place to anyone we know.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-holland,,,,,
9,Jason C.,"Florham Park, NJ",0,6,1.0,1.0,2015-08-20,"I worked in the service industry for roughly six years of my life, in fact, I got my start working in the service industry at a Chili's in Sarasota, FL. Last night, I had by far the most shocking experience I've ever had or witnessed myself at this location. We had a party of ten people at the bar around 10p last night, one individual in our party had drank a little too much and was slurring his words, to the bartenders credit they cut the individual off - which is not only the right thing to do, but was completely admirable. However, the staff failed to inform the other nine individuals that were there enjoying themselves responsibly.  At some point during the night, the person cut off asked for a little of another person's margarita, she gave him a little (not knowing he had been cut off) and then had her drink taken away. A few minutes later, a separate person in the party tried to order a drink for herself and was informed the entire table would no longer be served. Fine, the way the manager/staff handled the situation wasn't the greatest in terms of letting the rest of us know there was an issue, but if she decided we were all cut off and would no longer serve us, that is her decision. The problem, and shocking thing, was what transpired next. The person unable to order her next drink, who was not intoxicated at all, asked for an explanation, as there were nine of us that had no idea what had been happening. Even the woman that lost her drink was given no explanation. The manager proceeds to beginning yelling at the woman in our party asking for an explanation. This immediately created a scene. Our entire party was now looking at the manager yelling at someone in our party. Other patrons in the bar were looking at the manager. I've seen drunk people create scenes, rude patrons, but I've never in my life seen a manager yell at a customer, let alone START yelling at a customer without even having been yelled at in the first place. It was the most unprofessional thing I've seen in all of my working years, let alone just in a restaurant. The fact that this wasn't even a staff member, it was the person responsible for the entire restaurant that evening. The last time I had gone to a Chili's before this trip was eight years ago, I haven't stepped foot in a Chili's because I had gotten food poisoning two times in a row from a location in Miami. This was the next thing I will now remember about Chili's. It is no wonder that this location looks dead every night I have been in town working here. Absolutely unprofessional behavior from someone that is supposed to be a leader. As long as the manager ""Ashley,"" if that is indeed her name, is employed at this location, I would recommend taking your business elsewhere. In fact, Ralphie's across the street was a great time and I never had any issue. By all means, this location should be avoided, and if the manager's behavior and my prior experience with Chili's is any indicator, I believe this is a systematic cultural issue with the chain. Buyer beware.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-holland,,,,,

6,Dana N.,"Holland, OH",12,11,4.0,1.0,2016-01-17,"Such a beautifully remodeled hot mess. Went on a Saturday afternoon and where to begin. Upon entering, could tell right away that they were quite busy and seriously understaffed. Should have left right then. My fault. Host neither asked how many in our party, or any communication whatsoever.  Upon being seated, ordered our drinks and a pick 3 appetizer. After waiting in excess on 35 minutes, appetizer arrived with 3 plates (there were 4 of us). 2 of the plates were soaking wet, apparently fresh from the dishwasher. Unwrapped the silverware, and found the napkin is dirty.  At this point, called over the manager. Mike (the manager basically stood next to our table and argued with me. I had to show him the dirty napkin several times before he said ""so do you need new silverware?"" Really??? Yes I said, he says ""how many?""  At this point I think realized that Mike is clearly not up to the task of a busy restaurant, and zero customer service skills.  Tomorrow will be a busy day for me contacting the General manager and corporate for Chili's. Do not stop here if they even appear busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-holland,,,,,
10,Steven T.,"Wauseon, OH",1,10,,4.0,2016-01-22,"Horrible seating arrangements however, Our waitress, I think her name was Kristen,  was phenomenal. Prime Rib Fajitas were delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-holland,,,,,
4,Edwin R.,"Maumee, OH",0,3,,1.0,2016-12-23,So I went to Chili for dinner and will not go again My son's nachos had a hair in his food. We still had to pay for his food  Also they have this game controller on the table and my son was playing around with it and hit one of the keys and we got charged 1.99.  It's not the cost that bothered me it's the fact that it didn't ask if we were sure we wanted this and that we would be charged    What a crock. This is how this co makes a few bucks never again Chili's not another dime from me.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-holland,,,,,
5,Allison A.,"Berkey, OH",37,18,,1.0,2017-01-15,Bad service. Food is taking forever. Just can't have good service here. A manager just walked right past our table and did many stop and ask how anything is. Typical crappy chain restaurant,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-holland,,,,,
3,Rose B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,,4.0,2017-06-09,"Three cheers for taco Tuesday!    All tacos are $2.  I had the prime rib taco - the meat was melt-in-your-mouth-tender!  It was after lunch but before dinner, so the restaurant was almost empty.  Friendly and attentive service.  Food came out quickly.  Restroom was very clean.  This is a very spacious Chili's, Perfect for a large group!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-holland,,,,,
2,Bayan A.,"Toledo, OH",0,6,1.0,2.0,2017-09-01,"I had the worst experience in this Chili's recently. The service was awful; no waitress was waiting for us to take us to the table, food was cold and bland.  This is unfortunate because it is the nearest to my home!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-holland,,,,,
0,Jeff J.,"Swanton, OH",1,9,4.0,5.0,2017-11-13,Our new favorite go to restaurant. Service is fantastic. Great value for price.  Everything we have ordered has been fantastic.  It is also appreciated that the manager makes a point of stopping at your table and checking to see that everything was satisfactory.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-holland,,,,,
1,S.e. W.,"Toledo, OH",5,8,,1.0,2017-12-14,"Went to Chili's today since their new advertisement boasts new menu, better fajitas etc. Never ever will I return to Chili's. The waitress was excellent but the food wasn't good and the nasty drinking mugs (mind you even the replacement mugs were just less dirty). Maybe if you are really drunk late at night it's tolerable, if not don't go there expecting anything good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-holland,,,,,
