Traveling on business, dining alone.  Seated promptly, then promptly forgotten.  Once served, the food was...così così.  Not bad, not good, just so so. Standard chain fare. The boneless wings had too much buffalo sauce, almost sickeningly too much. The ""lighter fare"" broccoli had...cheese? Not a lot, but not expected either. Good thing it wasn't a lot or this lactose intolerant individual would have been in trouble (no Lactaid!). Once dinner was over I spent I don't know how much time waiting, waiting, waiting once more for my server to check back with me. Even the manager (I'm assuming he was the manager) came by to check before she did.

54,Alan P.,"Holtsville, NY",0,5,,1.0,2013-12-02,"As others have noted this is chain restaurant located near a very large movie theater, so they do not need to earn a customer following. I generally avoid this place, however I regrettably gave it a try late Saturday night. I ordered the Trio Fajita and my wife ordered a chicken salad. When the Fajita arrived I was a bit stunned due to the lack of the Sizzling Steamy Fajita cast iron pan. Instead it was a dude, just warm to the touch! The mounds of onions were impressive but was only served a few Pepper s. I was too hungry to send it back so spoke to a manager who later offered desert to compensate the lame dish.  Unless your going for Drinks and Apps I would avoid this place.

Tonight's visit was far from that; aside from their hostess., they were all too busy trying to close up the kitchen. We arrived a whole two hour before closing and one hour before the kitchen closed. The servers were too busy worrying about closing that they were sweeping right next to our table as we were eating. Rolling their eyes when we asked for a minute to decided if we were going to have dessert, yelling from the kitchen out to the dining area. Where was the manger?

The rest room here was disgracefully nasty.  In fact, the three-star rating is really more for the Chili's menu, and their other locations.  I like Chili's for the most part, but this one needs some clean-up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-holtsville?start=20,2.8,2.8,2.8,2.9240000000000004,2.8

22,Peter S.,"Holtsville, NY",2,8,,4.0,2016-01-17,"We live in the area, and are usually here 2-3 times per month, sometimes for dine-in and sometimes for takeout. In general, we've had good food. I think we've covered the entire menu by now. It's pretty standard fare for this type of restaurant, but I guess a few of their choices appeal to our taste buds a little more. The location can get pretty busy, but we've never had to wait more that 10 minutes, even in a packed house, so everything moves along pretty well. The service is generally fast and attentive. It can be a little slow to re-order drinks after the first bite check in, but the newer tablets take care of this. The only drawback I've found is that my wife did get sick one night after eating a salad with grilled chicken. The chicken was cooked, but I'm guessing something wasn't right because she was sick for a few days. We'd eaten there so many times before that, so we chalked it up to a bad experience. I even called the restaurant to let them know what happened, and to tell them to check their chicken, vegetables, etc. I didn't give my name, but the manager (assistant, I think) kept apologizing and offering me a gift card.

Southwestern eggs rolls are pretty good quite tasty w the avocado ranch sauce.  Cheddar bites are not bad , would be great if they were all the same larger size pieces since of course these are the pieces with the cheese in them good with the chili ranch sauce.

With all these chain restaurants, you've seen one you've seen them all, but Chili's has a different vibe and attitude. It has low light and a impressive mix of color lights to make you feel like you you parting from your seat. The waiter was also very nice and on top of things. I was impressed because there were a lot of guest in the building but he gave great service . I was also quite entertained with the monitor at the table. You can pay from the touchscreen or play games with other guest while you eat. My friend and I played and won many rounds of the quiz game. I also enjoyed the food. I of course got a cheeseburger and she got a grilled chicken fajita. I tried hers and I liked it. My burger was a burger quesadilla and it was good also. Then the waiter talked us into the cookie in the skillet with ice cream. We only needed one because it was a decent size. She ate most of it (or did I) and the cookie was warm with one big scoop of ice cream on top. I will definitely be going back.

I got a 2 for $20 w/ chips and guacamole for the appetizer and the meals were a steak fajitas and chicken ranch quesadillas. The chips and guac were okay, but the times that I've been here the chips have always been inconsistent...sometimes they're oily, sometimes they're too salty, sometimes they're just fine. The salsa is the usual pureed consistency that is salty and the guac was a little salty this time also. I might ask them if they have pico next time. For the meals, they were okay and nothing special. The portions are right, tasted fine, and no real issues. The steak was an extra $2 (only chicken and carnitas are the regular choices). For the service, you always get 2 host/hostess but usually we only really get serviced by one of them. This time, both came around a good number of times but they don't seem to know what each other is doing because one would come around asking for the same (drinks, orders, etc.) that the other just took. No big deal...better than not having them come around at all. We also got margaritas (two fers) and they were okay but hardly had salt on the rim.

We choose an appetizer to share and we each get a full size entree of our own. It's a great deal for your money! Especially because fajitas are an entree choice.  2fers are an all day special!! Yay for double beers!  Make sure you sign up for chilis rewards!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-holtsville,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88
4,Carl M.,"Bellport, NY",96,31,49.0,3.0,2016-12-11,"Chili's Been here a few times with my girlfriend. Not a bad location , by island 16 movie theater. Everytime we go in the host always wants us to be placed by the door. Mind you its winter season. Its cold. Thats the last spot anyone wants to eat at.  The staff is very loud. Asked to move our set. Was placed my the kitchen. The staff was louder than the resterant. But the server was nice and on time with everything. Food tonight was banging. Was great. Prob best i had there so far. I ordered the Chicken Crispers. With a side of fries and broccoli. The french fries weren't so good at all. Was very dry n tasteless. Also when i added ketchup. Petty. The broccoli was great. The dessert was great. We had the new Salted Caramel Molten. So goood! Was fantastic! Great time coming this time. Just wish the staff was a bit nore on the up and up on things. Coming to placement and how loud they're. I wanted to say something, but i kept cool.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-holtsville,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92

Whenever I come here with my boyfriend the hostess always wants to put us at crappiest table possible!! I always have to say something and end up making them switch us to a booth or a table at least away from the damn door! On another visit we also encountered a waitress who was so annoying and desperate for a tip that she practically begged for it by the end of the meal.  The food here is good though. I always get the same thing: the triple dipper. Tonight my boyfriend and I tried their new dessert the pecan cinnamon cake (not sure the name) and it was amazing!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-holtsville,3.08,3.08,3.08,,3.0800000000000005

11,Louis D.,"Farmingville, NY",0,21,1.0,1.0,2017-01-29,"Stopped by for lunch on a Saturday and ordered the ultimate bacon burger.  I was surprised that the waiter kept a straight face when he placed the plate on the table. The burger was literally swimming in grease. Since we were on a schedule, I tried to power through the meal because the waiter was no where in site for the next 10 minutes. I used 4 napkins to try and clean up this mess and gave up a 1/4 way through. Tried to flag down the manager, but he was too busy with his back to the dining room on his phone.  Left the comment on the table kiosk, but, I know it won't go anywhere. If I can help one person, I would say either eat somewhere else or please please get someone to come over and pay attention to you. Have them recook your entree and don't make movie reservations around your meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-holtsville,3.2,3.2,3.2,,3.2000000000000006

Then, she said she'd be right back... Yeah, right. When another girl came over she had to start the orders, they weren't even ready so I had to wait again. Got back to the office only to find out we had no utensils or napkins. Oh and they couldn't use my Plenti card... ""They don't have that.""  Really?

21,Kristen W.,"East Moriches, NY",30,63,8.0,2.0,2017-04-08,"Saturday night at Chili's. Really nothing to brag about. Got there about 6:30p and headed to the bar for a pre dinner cocktail. Bar was so crowded and there was only 1-2 bartenders; we quickly gave up on the idea of ever getting a drink. Our group was on the large side, 9 people, so we called ahead for seating (it's not called a reservation ). Our party was set to arrive at 7 and our table was ready by 6:50- pretty impressive. That was the most impressive moment of the night. The service was rather slow; we actually got comped an appetizer of wings for being so slow. We weren't given any utensils or plates for the appetizers. Drinks were scarce and you had to work to get refills. The food was pretty mediocre. For appetizers our table ordered the nachos, wings, and bottomless nachos. The nachos were bland and overcooked and the bottomless nachos had a bottom after the first round (we couldn't track down our waitress to order another). For entrees, I got the smothered chicken burrito which was actually OK.  My husband got the rib and chicken combo. Both meats were severely dry. Highly doubtful I'll ever return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-holtsville?start=20,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96

I meet with a lot of guys from my job there for lunch once a month and we are now going to look for another place to have our meeting . We have been coming there for about 3 yrs every month . But if they can't even have wifi for customers, there are so many other places we can go ! Also corporate does not even have a customer service number .

We were seated right away in the empty restaurant (as it was pretty early for dinner) which I thought was to our advantage. Our server was really nice and accommodating, although it felt like we were sort of waiting on him most of the time. We ordered the 2 for $22 dinner option and we're both satisfied with the amount of food. We ordered the Texas cheese fries app which is always really cheesy with plenty of green onions. For dinner, my girlfriend subbed out the grilled chicken salad with the quesadilla explosion salad and I ordered the chicken crispers. The food here is sort of just 'eh' and we both were satisfied, but nothing fantastic. It's a chain after all. But the price was right and it's convenient, so I'd probably return. Don't expect the service to be super quick - give yourself enough time if you plan on heading to the movie theatre after!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-holtsville,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88
