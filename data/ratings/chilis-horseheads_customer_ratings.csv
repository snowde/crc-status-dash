10,Michelle B.,"Elmira, NY",87,55,14.0,4.0,2014-01-09,"Chilis...the restaurant was once on my Elmira ""blacklist"" of places that Mr. P and I avoid like the plague due to past experiences of ""stomach irritation sessions.""   We decided to give Chilis another try after about 2 years of avoidance and we weren't disappointed!  I don't know if this Chilis did a major revamp of their menu and staff or if this is a chain improvement all over but all I can say is YUM!  I had some kind of mexican chicken quesadilla salad which was amazing and Mr. P had some kind of pizza with chicken and avocados.  Both plates were wonderful and sparked our tastebuds.  The service was amazing.  Our waiter was so friendly and fast.  Overall a good experience.  We erased Chilis off of our blacklist and will be returning there soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-horseheads,,,,,
7,Jim M.,"Canton, PA",2,33,15.0,5.0,2015-02-02,As with any chain restaurant the food is always the same. We eat here often because if the great service.  Servers are quick to bring what ever you may need.  Never need to ask for drink refills.  Recommend sitting in the bar area if you want to watch TV's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-horseheads,,,,,
0,Julie C.,"Cayuta, NY",7,66,10.0,4.0,2015-02-20,"Came for lunch, daughter and I got lunch combos. Husband or appetizer trio as meal.  Lunch burgers came out, no soup. Still 10 minutes after they came out m husband does not have his food and soups still missing! Unreal!! Update: waitress says no clue what happened. And husbands meal compensated. Told her soups didn't come out, she then brought bowls to compensate (instead of cups). Also compensated a free dessert and milk for my girls to share!  moved up to 4 stars from 2 for this visit. Waitress handled it well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-horseheads,,,,,

8,Angela F.,"New Albany, OH",0,13,4.0,2.0,2015-10-03,Service is super slow. My chicken in the tostada and enchilada is a weird texture. It's super rubbery like it's been reheated. The other people in my party got hamburgers and liked them.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-horseheads,,,,,
3,Dave B.,"Theater District, Manhattan, NY",16,38,38.0,4.0,2016-06-04,"We went to Chili's after a long day at work.   I order a ice tea to start, which they were out of for some reason, so I went for ice water and a chocolate milk shake!   The milk shake was awesome!!   Then I ordered a Santa Fe Chicken Salad!!   It was excellent!!!   Lots of chicken cooked perfectly, a little spicy burn to it and creamy smooth ranch lightly put on top.  Our waitress was a sweetheart and came back to check on us always at the right time!!  Great dinner and I would definitely go back!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-horseheads,,,,,

4,Lisangely E.,"Alfred, NY",164,4,,3.0,2017-03-27,"Came here on a sunday got seated right away. Our server was Tiffany. She was great beyond words. Checked up on us a decent amount of times and conversed with us every single time. Has a great sense of humor and very good work ethics. It almost felt like we knew her for a long time. However, I give the place 3 stars because apart from our wonderful service, there were many flaws. Some of us received the wrong order, I found a hair in my food as well as a sticker ? , and most of us disliked our meals. 2/6 of us were satisfied but the rest of us didn't enjoy. I myself got a chicken burrito which was smothered in some very great sauce but the burrito itself was very bland with a ton of rice and a little bit of chicken. The drinks were pretty good and the 2 for 1 beer made us happy. The manager whose name i didn't get was also very friendly and considerate and removed many items on our check. Great service and hospitality however the kitchen staff needs to get it together. Probably won't go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-horseheads,,,,,
1,Dustin S.,"Muskogee, OK",69,25,4.0,5.0,2017-06-02,Made a big order for the race track in Watkins glen. They did a fantastic job of making sure it was on time and plenty of food. Staff and management where great. We will be back. Thanks!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-horseheads,,,,,
2,Sandy W.,"Wellsboro, PA",0,1,,4.0,2017-06-07,"Stopped in for dinner after shopping.  Menu has expanded and done up as summer 2017.  Many choices to choose from. Food was very good! Compliments to our server Joey!  Hasn't been there long but did an excellent job. Spoke loud and clear? (Nice as husband has hearing problems),  suggestions , came back and checked on us and spaced it accordingly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-horseheads,,,,,
