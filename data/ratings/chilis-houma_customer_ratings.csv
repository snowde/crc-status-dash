9,Matt R.,"New Orleans, LA",524,513,289.0,3.0,2012-07-05,"Typical Chili's experience... nothing bad, nothing great... only memorable event was that they never brought my soup out.  BOTTOM LINE: Just another typical Fern Joint.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houma,,,,,
14,Shannon S.,"Houston, TX",6,15,,4.0,2014-08-05,The food is always good at chilis... No matter what city it seems.  But in this city.. If you can tolerate their staff socializing instead of cleaning the tables off so the customers waiting can be seated then it's a decent place to eat.  I believe her name was Mandy that spent more time socializing than working.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houma,,,,,
15,Daniela J.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,50,,2.0,2014-10-02,"Great food. Terrible service . Waitress was a bit ditzy and barely serviced us or anyone else for that matter. The table next us had children who needed a booster seat. We told her shouldn't they have one to keep from jumping all over the place , she told us ""they didn't ask for one"" and still refuse to bring them one. She also kept forgetting to bring us things, like spinach dip and no chips! Careless and dumb . Great food however",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houma,,,,,
11,Taylor C.,"New Orleans, LA",177,7,1.0,2.0,2014-11-28,"Every time I eat Chilis, whether it be to-go or dine-in, my food is always cold. Southwest egg rolls should not be soggy and cold. My big mouth bites were overcooked and cold. I'm just going to assume the food I order is never fresh, or that they don't have a proper working heating lamp. Chilis isn't what it used to be, and it's not only the Houma location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houma,,,,,
10,Ebony H.,"Austin, TX",1,12,,2.0,2015-01-21,"If it weren't for the server, this review would be much worse.  My co-workers (3) and I went to Chili's for lunch and opted to order items off of their new leaner menu.  Well after waiting nearly 30 minutes for our food, we received the wrong food.  Our food didn't come with some of pictured menu items, like a salad with Romain and fetta or the grilled avocados. We did get a side salad of iceberg lettuce delivered later and then a few slices of avocado.  Because everything was so late coming to the table, it wasn't worth sending anything back as we had to return to our work.  Before leaving, I asked to speak to the manager. He comes from the kitchen, but instead of offering an apology for the slow and incorrect food, he responds ""that's what happens when people don't come to work"".  Really?!  is that appropriate? I wasn't mad until that moment.   Again, if it weren't for the server who did an excellent job at engaging us, despite having difficulties, I'd rate this place piss poor. Thank you Kita for being professional and courteous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houma,,,,,
8,Eliz L.,"Sour Lake, TX",11,1,1.0,1.0,2015-01-21,"I choose only 1 star for the food. The service I give a 5. We order the new light lunch, nothing was right with the order. The service was great, so we decided to talk to the manager. Well I feel as though our waitress would be a better manager, because the manager acted like we where putting him out, gave us so many excuses. His final words where ok thanks. Please act like you love your job.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houma,,,,,
0,Chantelle T.,"Metairie, LA",28,5,,2.0,2015-03-08,"This had to be the worst experience of dining out in a while. First off. We ordered an appetizer of fried pickles. For $5 and some change u get a handful of them! (Que the sarcasm ) What a steal of a deal!!! They were floating in the grease they were fried in. The coating came off of every single one of them. Not appealing in the least! Not only that, it was a ridiculous price for the quantity of pickles. You can normally go to ANY restaurant and get 4-5 times the amount for that price.  Secondly, I ordered fajitas which normally comes to the table either sizzling or blazing hot right? That didn't happen. Everyone's food at the table was lukewarm and or cold. I could actually touch the cast iron dish with my bare hands. Her coworker had to help her bring food out so that alone tells me that it was sitting there waiting. IJS.  My chicken didn't even look charred enough to even be called grilled. We call them to come get all of our plates and the server had the nerve to argue me down and say that they just took it off the grill. No sweetie. Not when the flour tortillas are stuck to the paper, shredding and crumbling apart from sitting there too long. She then CONTINUED to argue me down. I give them 2 stars because they at least went warm the food and it was edible. Will I go back?? Naw. I'm good. Chili's management need to check these waitresses. As a matter of fact my waitresses name was Fallon. I hope that someone from this Chili's,  #647 sees this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houma,,,,,
13,Ashley C.,"Grand Isle, LA",0,4,,1.0,2015-03-13,"Awful experience for my husband and I last Monday. We are from Newport news, va and have always loved Chili's and their food and service. Our food was awful at this Chili's and service was basic. My husband had a smoked chicken quesadilla and the chicken was overdone, tortilla dry, and some pieces had mostly onion and little chicken. I had a Chipotle fresh mex bowl and they didn't have all the ingredients (no black beans or tortilla crips) and the chicken was completely bland, overcooked and tasted like rubber. I ordered the buy one get on free margarita and they brought both drinks out to me at once. I understand making sure everyone gets their drinks, but I want a fresh cold drink, not a watered down beverage. We were so disappointed and will not be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houma,,,,,
12,Rebecca V.,"Houma, LA",3,43,159.0,1.0,2015-11-14,"I am pretty sure I will get social security before my meal gets here...I'm 43.....it is taking sooooooo long. It took too long to get drinks and take our order. We did get our appetizer in good time. We got the triple dippers. The fried pickles were very greasy and soggy. The fried cheese was good and the onion rings were ehhh ok. I ordered a bowl of chicken tortilla soup and while it was a full bowl...it was not hot and was average tasting. During the meal we were left with empty glasses too long. The waitress was nice, just took a long time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houma,,,,,
5,Carla B.,"Houma, LA",0,2,3.0,4.0,2016-04-22,"The service was ok, I tried the Tito's punch and it was so good! If you like sweet pineapple, then this is the perfect drink! The southwestern egg rolls were delish  too, crunchy and not at all greasy. My favorite appetizer from there. Also the loaded boneless wings were good! Packed with 3 different melted cheeses, crispy bacon pieces, and topped with green onions. I gotta have them every time I go there!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houma,,,,,
6,John D.,"Houma, LA",0,6,,1.0,2016-05-05,"Probably the worst service I've ever received. I brought some business associates to dinner and I'm pretty embarrassed. It was late so our options were limited, and we opted with chili's.  To start the night, the seat on the bench in the waiting area was not assembled correctly and was way off center.  One of the folks in our group sat down on it, and the top fell off of the bench ejecting my associates wife, sending her to the floor. The manager never showed up to apologize or ask if everyone was okay...and she could have been really hurt.  Then when ordering an appetizer we asked for the table side guacamole. Had to remind her a couple times. She then brings out the wrong thing. When she finally brought the right order, she wanted us to mix the guacamole. With those types of orders you are paying more for service and an experience. If I wanted to do it myself I wouldn't be at a restaurant.  Then she forgot to enter my associates meal into the system. Everyone was finished by the time he got his food. Half of our party of 6 had to leave. I waited with my guests, apologizing for the poor service like it was my fault. Then when I paid, the woman hovered over my shoulder, and stole the little kiosk thing when I was done paying and FILLED OUT HER OWN SURVEY!!!! I wanted to talk to the manager...but he could not be found anywhere!  I entertain guests a lot for work, and that is the last time I will trust this chili's with a business guest...and probably the last time I'll be visiting personally.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houma,,,,,

7,Kristian H.,"Houma, LA",26,4,,1.0,2017-02-03,"i just spent my last gift card at chilis. now i dont have anything to make me go back. it used to be one of our go to places. not any more.  the food has been going down hill. in fact one of our last visits my husband wanted a steak and the waitress strait up told him to order it cooked less than he normally likes it because they have a tendency to burn them. another one we went and the hostess was quite hostile. we had 2 kids with us, she asked if we wanted to sit in the bar. we looked but all they had was high tops open with high chairs those obviously dont work so we said no thank you and asked for a regular dinning area. she very rudely said fine but you have to wait all our servers just sat tables so they need about 10 min to greet those tables and get appetizers in, wait here and walked away. we didnt wait we left.  the last visit made me completely done though. i ordered to go to use my gift card because i was in a hurry. i got their,went in the to go door, there was a lacy there she walked away with out greeting me. she was going through a to go food container and she had another in her hand. the manager walked to the back where i was standing on the opposite side. you could also see the food line where i was standing. he told them this line  needs to be cleaned i know people are about to be getting off get it done before then. the girl who ignored me for the past 5 minutes says oh, i know i get off in 10min. im waiting on my food then going. so shes still on the clock just not serving me. finally another few minutes another waitress who was actually working came out with a tables food asked me if i had been served i told her no, she said she would be right with me. she came back took my name and got my food. guess what my food was in the container the server opened then closed because it wasnt hers, the same server who was still on the clock. it took all of 2 seconds for my card to be slid, and say have a nice day. why couldnt i have gotten prompt service when i walked in especially since my food was sitting there.  get it together. slow service, cold food, and rude staff no need to have that experience again",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houma,,,,,

3,Jon P.,"Houma, LA",0,2,,1.0,2017-10-16,"High prices, low quality, poor service, cold food, poor attitudes. Too many eateries in the area to tolerate this kind of poor experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houma,,,,,
1,Stephanie-Lynn W.,"Loveland, CO",127,11,,1.0,2017-11-13,If you are a restaurant that is open until 11 then why are you rude to customers who come in 30 minuets before. Also if you are open until 11 don't you think you should wait until after you close to throw out food so customers who are coming here can actually get what they want to eat. This is the second time I've come here in a month and both times the same bartender has been rude and now I can't even order what I wanted. Won't be back and I don't Recomend it to anyone!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houma,,,,,
