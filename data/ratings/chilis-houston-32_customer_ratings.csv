53,Ami H.,"Missouri City, TX",36,31,7.0,1.0,2013-07-29,"Where to begin? I met some girl friends there with my children. They were already seated when we arrived. Once we were seated, our waiter came to take our drink orders. He was a young guy. Hey, I was a teenager when I started waitressing as well so no biggie. BUT, he turned out to be very incompetent and just had no clue. My 2 friends ordered salads with their meals- they came out the same time as the entree. It's already a full table with all of us so this left very little room on the table top. He would place full dishes directly in front of my grabby 8-month old with no regard to hot plates or what have you. Okay, some people don't know, that's fine. I just whisked them out of harm's way. But why are you continuing to do so?? He got my kid's meal order wrong, but as he was already hungry at that point, I didn't make a fuss with it. He got my order wrong, which I did ask him to correct. I had ordered the original chicken crispers with sweet potato fries. (At the time I was ordering I asked if the sweet potato fries could be substituted for the regular. He replied that that shouldn't be a problem.) I mean, if I'm going to pay all this extra money for a dish, I expect to get what I want. I feel the same way towards my own customers. You should be satisfied. Well, we got through the meal. I had to flag other servers down for water re-fills, boxes that I had already asked for, and extra bags because 1 bag for multiple people going in separate directions really won't work that well. In addition, I placed a to-go order. Again, these were placed directly in front of the children where some of the containers were knocked over.  The checks-- he split the checks appropriately, though it really took far too long to bring them. My very patient friend got exasperated at this point. Once I reviewed my check I saw a charge for an add-on item.  I questioned the waiter what that was about. He said for the parmesan fries. Parmesan fries? Who had that? Well, you did. Umm, no I didn't. You mean the sweet potato fries? Oh yea, uhh, yea that was it. Ok, but I asked if it would be ok and you said it shouldn't be a problem? Then this kid says, Oh I think I said I'd go check and come back and let you know. There is an additional fee. Ummmm, no. You never came back to tell me, when I asked you said it shouldn't be a problem, so could you please go remove that, thank you. He ended up taking it off. Now, this kid is obviously not that efficient. Fine, maybe it's a first job. Never ONCE did any member of management come over to check on our table after ALL THESE ISSUES! I have never worked at a restaurant where a manager didn't at least try to follow up with something like this, even if it was just a simple apology. SO, we all closed our checks. I will not be calling in to the stupid customer satisfaction survey number just so I can get a discount code for my next visit because I promise you, THERE WILL BE NO NEXT VISIT!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-32?start=40,1.3800000000000003,1.3800000000000003,1.3800000000000003,1.3800000000000003,1.3800000000000003
48,Adam B.,"Houston, TX",1,21,13.0,1.0,2014-02-13,"From walking in I knew I should have sat at the bar. Though doubt that would have made things better.  I waited 37 minutes for an appetizer, while the table next to me say 20 minutes after I did for their appetizer and meal before I got my single half order or Fries.  Then once my meal arrived, 45 minutes after being sat down, it was incorrect. Had to send it back and explain my order twice more before he understood the order.  The food was not the cause of the rating, but the lack of service and obvious inconsistency of wait staff and training.  This not my normal area of Houston but I have had far better service at many other Chili's restaurants. As a former waiter, 5 years in 4 star establishment, I know what it takes to provide acceptable service and spectacular service. This comes no where near reasonable or  acceptable.

Nonetheless, date settled on a beer because the bar wasn't stocked with any of the 4 drinks requested. Either that or the bartender just had no clue. With a plate of ribs and mash potatoes with corn.

54,Jose R.,"Central Southwest, Houston, TX",15,1,,1.0,2015-01-20,If possible I would give them no stars for their bad customer service. They have the dumbest policy that you can't split a check when it's 7 or more. It is not my fault that other customers have walked out on them. Later that night I realized why ppl would dine and dash and it's because their service is horrible. It took exactly one hr and 14 min to get my COLD triple dipper.

28,Tom P.,"Richmond, TX",0,4,1.0,1.0,2016-07-04,"Worst managed restaurant period.  To start there was a wait even though the restaurant was only maybe 2/3 filled.  Not enough wait staff apparently...how does a restaurant chain like Chilis management not have enough staff?  It's not there first rodeo! Extremely long wait for our order, probably 40-45 minutes.  And then only 2 of 5 orders came out. Our Waiter Al was a nice guy, tried his best but man Chili's HQ needs to get down here and fix this place up. Clearly the employees are not properly trained.  Our waiter kept asking us who brought out the incorrect orders; asked us what is in our order that they didnt bring out; asked several times for a new ICED tea...none came; did not try to even compensate us for the bad service and mediocre food. Just plain BAD.  My wife will not go to any Chili's due to this place and experience.  Only good news is that the food did not get anyone in my family ill.

17,Candice E.,"Pearland, TX",17,22,182.0,1.0,2017-01-18,I really really HATE to give bad reviews but this location has really gone downhill.  The customer service is horrible!!! I live close to here and use to come here regularly with my mom and sister. We would always sit at the bar and knew most of the people here.  I haven't been here in at least 6 months because of the last bad experience. I thought if I ordered something to go tonight it would be ok because it was a simple order. The website said it would take 30 minutes for my order but I decided to go up there after 15 minutes since it was just soup and salad.  I get up to the counter and the employee pulled up my order and told me my total. She goes into the kitchen and when she comes back she tells me they are out of the soup I ordered. Thats not a big deal but it would have been nice to get that information before I drove up there. I asked if they normally call to let people know that the item they ordered is not available. Instead of just apologizing or trying to correct it she blames it on someone else taking the last of the soup. I decide to order something else because I was already there then I sit and wait for my order. I pay for my food and she goes into the kitchen. She came back and said they wanted to know if I wanted them to make some more soup. I told her no because I ordered paid for my food. They are other people coming in to pick up their orders and I notice that they all recieve subpar customer service. When she hands me my food I say thank you. She doesnt even look up and walks in the kitchen. I glanced at my food before leaving just to make sure it was what I ordered. When I get home I realize my food is drowning in sauce. It was really ridiculous. It was so much that I couldn't enjoy it and ended up throwing it away. I guess I ended up getting soup in the end. While I appreciate them offering to make the original fiod I ordered they really need to have some additional training.

We waited twenty minutes for the waiter to get our orders, and another twenty for the food to arrive. One of the orders was messed up. After fifteen minutes of watching the mail waiters skirt around us, a lady waitress took the food back for correction. Thirty minutes later, the salad had still not arrived. It's a freaking salad! Why does it take 30 minutes to make?!?! Jacob, the MVP, came to our aid, got the salad, provided the dressing that was missing. While Jacob was getting the dressing, our actual waiter, who we hadn't seen this entire time, came by and picked up all of the silverware. So, they couldn't eat the salad. Once Jacob came back with the dressing, he went and got silverware. We tipped him directly, he was the only competent reliable individual in this entire masquerade of a restaurant. When we got here, there was a family behind us. It's been over an hour since they left and their dirty dishes are still on the table. The cherry on top of the experience was the skillet cookie. Surprise! They're out of spoons and we have to use forks. Which, I know, first world problems. That doesn't bother me, it's the fact that these dishes are sitting in the open air not being cleaned and it's impacting the service to its customers. I felt like I went out to eat at a Frat house.
