73,Garth V.,"Houston, TX",7,310,2.0,4.0,2012-07-16,"Ok admittidly Im not a big fan of Chilis. This one is close to the house and we wanted something quick and casual...didnt want any fast food by any means. We relunctantly decided to go to Chilis over by the Target on Taylor and I10. we were pleasantly surprised...the staff was professional and helpful. We never needed to try and find our waitress to fill our tea glasses or remove the dirty dishes. Even the hostess as well as the manager both came by and ask how wwe were doing. We ordered off the Two for $20.00 menu. In fact both entrees that we both wanted were part of the choices along with several appiteasers.  All together is was a very nice casual, fast dining experience for us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-39?start=60,2.512,2.512,2.512,2.512,2.5120000000000005
20,Jazi H.,"Tulsa, OK",1122,352,2642.0,3.0,2012-08-01,This is the closest Chili's to my place. My parents love it so every time they come into town we eat here. The place is no different than any other franchise establishments.  The service is really good though. They are always friendly and super accommodating to my mom's crazy requests. I always ask for extra buffalo sauce for my wings and corn tortillas and they happily comply.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-39?start=40,2.316,2.316,2.316,2.316,2.316

64,Tam M.,"Missouri City, TX",359,584,614.0,2.0,2013-01-28,"On a day when you get to leave work early to attend a training, but have time to actually sit DOWN and eat, I couldn't think of what to eat! CrAzY!!!  I had a Chinese craving yesterday that I didn't think was worth the gas to get, so I figured that would be the ticket, but then part of me really wanted a burger.  So Yelping and GPSing my location found me driving to Taylor Street, which as an array of chain restaurants a rock throw from each other. After looking at reviews, I decided to partake of Chili's. Last time I went to a CBG the service was quick during the later part of the day, so I figured in a location with all these restaurants they would be up to par.  Well the wait was more than I anticipated for a philly cheese fries and potato soup. Waiting for my order cut  so close into my commute time to my next destination I almost cancelled the order.  While waiting at the counter contemplating if I should cancel,  could see that they were not only backed up on orders, but they had water backed up on the floor. Standing water coming from Idontknowwhere and don'twant2knowwhere but it didn't look very sanitary.  Just imagine having to work in a busy, narrow, and hot kitchen with water on the floor.  That's a safety hazard if I've even seen one! Plus the food was not that great. The fries right out the fryer tasted decent because I was hungry; the philly was too cheesy rather than meaty, and the potato soup- Well, let's just say La Madeline has spoiled me because this potato soup tasted more like instant potatoes with chunks of REAL potato (maybe) mixed in for texture. Even though I asked the employee behind the register about the soups and he suggested this one, I think I'd stick with the chili because it was fantastic the last time I went to CGB. Also, I need to drink some Sprite and go to the little girls room after eating the soup, so yeah PASS ON THE POTATO SOUP!!!! After this review, I do believe I'll go ahead and do the restaurant review because standing water in a restaurant is a no no.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-39?start=60,2.056,2.056,2.056,2.056,2.056

Who wants to eat that? We went on a Friday night, and sat in the bar area. It took a while for our waitress to come and take our order, but you can't really expect more if you're sitting in the bar. I ordered a frozen strawberry margarita (yum) and it was only $5. You could taste the Cuervo they used, and my logic when it comes to margaritas is if you can't taste the tequila, you're not getting your money's worth.  Would I come back? Well, it's a Chili's.

30,Chad M.,"Houston, TX",581,517,214.0,3.0,2014-01-18,"In an attempt to eat somewhere that we haven't eaten in a long time, we chose Chili's on Katy Freeway next to Target. We arrived at lunch and received immediate seating, which was a surprise. I thought it would be packed on a Friday at noon, but surprisingly it wasn't. We got immediate service for drinks.  We had the lunch special, which has a soup/salad and a sandwich with fries (a few other options also) for about $8. That is a great lunch deal and the portions were the perfect size. I would have given this location a higher rating, but there were a few things that irked me: 1. The server was no that great - he was horrible, but he was obviously not very 'into' his job. 2. He would often walk by our table with a free hand and leave dirty dishes on the table - even though they were clearly moved to the side and ready to be removed. This happened about 5 times - so many times that we started to count. 3. We gave him the credit card to take care of the check. He then with his one free hand took food to other tables with our check and credit card in his hand. My thought that it was a perfect way to lose someone's credit card. 4. He seemed sluggish and not very quick - not the personality that I think Chili's is trying to promote. I don't know if it is a training issue for him or a job fit issue, but he could use some more training.  So the food was okay, the service was less than average, but just above being rated horrible. If we had a better service experience, I would have given another star. We would go back, but not with that server.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-39?start=40,1.9640000000000002,1.9640000000000002,1.9640000000000002,1.9640000000000002,1.9640000000000002

They have tablets at the tables now so that you can play games (you have to pay) and pay for your meal with your credit card at your table, but all I could think about was how covered in germs they must have been.

We wanted to sit in the bar area but all of the tables were dirty. She offered to clean one for us so we waited for her to clean one. It was another 5 min before she came back with a towel to clean the table. We finally sat down and quickly started looking at the menus. Another 5 min went by before anyone came by to take our drink order. He dropped off water and one of the drinks but doesn't take our food order. After another 5 min he finally comes back to take our order. We ordered fried pickles as an app, a burger and chicken crispers. 15 min go by and the pickles finally come out....soggy, greasy, and disgusting. He didn't back to check on the apps so we sat there for another 10 min with empty drinks, soggy pickles, and hunger pains. Our food came out before we were able to send back the pickles. We told him about pickles and he just said ""okay"" and walked away. He didn't offer to bring out another batch, or offer another option, or a credit.the bill. I was hoping the meal with be better than the app, but  that wasn't the case. The chicken was barely cooked, raw in some parts and felt slimey to the touch. The breading was soggy. The honey mustard sauce was watered down. The burger was overcooked. All of the food turned out so bad that i couldn't finish my meal and didn't want to bother with getting something else.

Right when I walk in I tell the hostess I want to watch the game in the bar area & she states there are no seats at the bar. Then ask me if I would like a booth on the other side. I asked her if there were any seats in the bar area at a table & she then said yes.  Once seated, I watch a guy behind me get seated at a table top & have a waitress address him. Once the waitress did come my way she ask if I need anything & I say yes, a menu & a drink menu. She points to the rack of menus which I over looked. A staff member (sweeping the floor) addressed me & tells me about the happy hour options for drinks/food. I ask her if she's the waiting staff for my table as I assume this is a conversation my waiter would have had but no. The lady who came prior & pointed at the rack of menus was my server it turns out.  At this point I notice there are SEVERAL empty seats at the bar. I approach & ask the other customers if these seats are taken & they say no.  The area hasn't been cleaned because there may have been some people who just left. No big deal, once the bar tender comes over I'm sure he'll address that.  NOPE. He grabs all the menus, including the one I brought with me. Takes the half full beer mug. Ask the guy next to me if someone was still sitting there (the seat next to me) & turns away. Ok, cool smh. A few seconds go by, maybe 30 & a trip or two past me by the bar tender. I go back to my car because I have water there & can just bring it inside. When I come back it's amazing, the area has been cleaned & menus removed. I guess he assumed I was leaving.

We stopped here yesterday (04/28/16) after running errands in the area. It was our first visit to this location and we should have known better judging from the lack of cars in the parking lot during the time that you would figure a restaurant to be busiest.  First off, when we walked in, we saw that hardly any customers were there and there was no one in sight at the hostess stand, except a cleaning bucket and spray on the stand. (o......k) Finally a guy, who turned out to be our waiter came to have us seated. He said we could choose wherever we wanted but then when we chose a booth by the window he said ""Oh no, that section is closed."" So we just picked another table and sat down. He brought us our waters and then my bf asked him for a beer on draft (that was listed as a draft beer on the menu) and the waiter said that they didn't have it. Ok. So we asked which beers DID THEY ACTUALLY HAVE on draft and he said he would check after he put in our meal order annnnnnnnnnd he never came back.  I ordered the Pasilla Chicken off of their ""Lighter Choices"" menu with steamed broccoli and their warm quinoa wheat berry blend, and my bf ordered the 10oz Classic Sirloin. Once we got our food, our waiter puts my plate in front of me and tells me ""Oh we didn't have the quinoa so I just brought you rice, is that ok?"" Um no, it's not. When restaurants run out of something, it's not a big deal to me since normally I find something else to substitute, but the waiter usually will let you know in advance what they ran out of and they will let you choose something else. Don't just assume what you think I will want. That rubbed me the wrong way.  I told him that I didn't want the rice and I politely asked for a house salad. At least my bf's order was correct and they brought him everything that he wanted. The whole dining experience was just off. Our waiter would take his time to come check on us but he found time to SIT DOWN next to another table and chat with the people eating at another booth. I noticed that there seemed to be quite a few employees standing around and joking with one another rather than working or checking on the other patrons, given, there were not many people in the restaurant but now I see why.

The manager on duty wasn't any help either. While I was waiting in vain to be assisted at the empty bar - yes, I was the only one there at the time - she didn't even say hi or even ask if I needed anything. When I asked her point-blank if anyone was bartending, she just replied: ""Oh, I'll go get him"" (meaning the bartender) - and she too disappeared. Oh, hell-to-the-no! ZAP - one star gone. The bartender - Felipe, if my receipt is correct - needed some help in a big way. When I asked him which beers were on tap, he just pointed to the wall. Oh, uh, OK - I'll take THAT one. Felipe may pour some great drinks, but being ""customer focused"" is not his strong point. I think it's a symptom of a bigger issue. The rest of the waitstaff was more interested in watching ESPN than serving their customers. While the manager on duty was busy cleaning and busing tables, the staff was watching TV. If anything else, I was going to ""pic-shame"" them and post it on Yelp. I was about to snap a picture on the down-low but I think they noticed that I was aiming in their direction and they scattered like cockroaches. ZAP - second star gone. Of course, Felipe was busy chatting with his regulars than to ask if I wanted a second beer, pour me some extra water or deliver more napkins without being told by me. If he had been attentive, I would have given him some extra padding for his tip. Nope - I had to ask for everything. ZAP - third star gone. Good thing I'm a Plenti member, since I got at least something for my troubles. But if I'm going to go to a Chili's in the future, it will be the one on 290 - with a nicer manager and sharp bartender - or the one on the Southwest Freeway, which also has great service and a very attentive lunchtime bartender. But I digress. Bottom line: I sure as heck won't be coming back here, unless serious changes to customer attention are made.   Personally, I think that GM David Hulsey needs to have a conference with his front-of-the-house help. IMMEDIATELY. All of these low-star reviews are valid, in my opinion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-39,1.6,1.6,1.6,,1.6000000000000003
8,Danielle D.,"Houston, TX",236,110,106.0,1.0,2017-06-04,"Upon seating us they told us our waiter's name. We waited about 10 mins before meeting him. A host finally came to take our drink orders and delivered them to us. We still hadn't met the waiter. Our drinks were never refilled the whole meal. Our appetizer was served with our meal. Fried pickles were lightly breaded and quite good, my prime rib mex bowl was heavy on the onions and the meat looked like it was meant for a stew. I would not recommend or re-order. My boyfriend got the salmon and he didn't voice any complaints or praise. I'm writing the review as we wait to ask for the check. Our waiter must be overworked because we only saw him the one time he took our order (for everything at once since it had taken him so long to arrive). Someone else had dropped off our food and we literally haven't seen him since. He hasn't checked in or cleared any plates. These chains should really invest in the pay at the table option like our friends at Olive Garden so when we don't see the waiter to ask for the check we can at least pay and leave on time. We asked for the check twice and the first time he said ""ok"" the second time he said ""I got you guys."" Sorry but no. You obviously don't got us.  Really poor service tonight. I won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-39,1.6,1.6,1.6,,1.6000000000000003
15,Ben E.,"Houston, TX",0,2,,3.0,2017-06-08,"Wife, daughter and I visited on Sunday, June 4, 2017.  We had issues.   I gave three stars, as opposed to one star, for the following reasons: 1. In the past, we have had consistently great service and fair to good wait timing. 2. The wait staff bust their ass every time we go there, including this time.  However, this should not negate the poor service reviews provided by others.  We have had cool tattooed waiter and waitress staff that really worked hard and provided great service in the past.   The waitress on this day was awesome and perfect.  She knew the specials and could recite them correctly spot on from memory.   She was prompt with no dilly dally. 3. We like the place.  And again, we had an awesome waitress. Now, the ding in stars (only 3 stars) is because we had issues.  We went here because my wife had a craving and we had a coupon for a free kids menu.   The hostess said that we could only have a high chair at a table with chairs, not a booth table.  The hostess said the issue had to do with the height of the booth table tops.  My wife and I said we want a booth, let's try the high chair with the booth.  We had to talk real sweet and patiently to try to convince the hostess to let us have a high chair at a booth.   This was our first compromise in staying and not leaving.  This was a little uncomfortable, because we have eaten a lot of times at Chili's over the past year, and we have not run across this issue before.  Chili's had not changed out their tables recently, and the booth tables were at the same exact height as the tables with the individual chairs.   Maybe we entered into the Twilight Zone, becasue the interaction was weird. So we ordered a kids meal and two adult entrees.   The waitress brings the drinks promptly.  Short time later the pineapple (side) for our daughter's kids meal arrives with the rest of her meal.  However, the bowl with teh pineapple looked a little dirty and there are a couple of chopped peepers on the pineapple.  So we dismiss it (unfortunately) and satyed.  This was our second compromise. I had a salad with my meal.  I asked for no cucumber and the dressing on the side.  The salad arrived shortly after our daughter's kids meal.  When I poured the dressing on the salad, there were large chunks of cucumber at the bottom of the dressing container (cup).  I thought someone in the kitchen is messing with us.  I started to pick the cucumber out (start of third compromise), but I said to my wife, ""no, that's it. I am not letting the rest of the meal go on like this.  What ele is next?  We are leaving.""  I had the same salad dressing before, and it did not have the cucumber in it, nor does the dressing recipe call for large chunks of cucumber. We only received drinks, the kids meal side of pineapple, the kids meal, and the unacceptable salad.   Although my wife cut up the kids meals into small pieces for our daughter, it was not eaten.  Only one to three pineapple pieces were eaten. I got up and politely asked for a manager. I waited about 5 minutes, and our server came out from the kitchen with an order of food.  I told her the problem and said we were leaving and not paying for anything.  ""We had not eaten the (figurative) ""steak"" after the issues arose"" as Judge Judy would say.   My wife wanted to make sure the manager heard why were leaving, so we waited another 5 minutes.  The hostess advised that the manager was not available to come talk to us, because she was on the phone with the police regarding a problem / incident with another customer.  So we finally left. The thing was that the compromises were quickly adding up, and we just did not want to have any more uncomfortable things come up over the course of the meal related to the food prep and our experience.   We wanted to avoid having to continue to compromise and just let additional worse stuff go if it continued to occur.   We were really hoping the manager or the wait staff would get together and tweak out these things and maybe get onto the kitchen staff to stop the poor food prep.  What if I were allergic to cucumbers?  Would it be OK?  It was not this extremely serious for us, because I did not eat any of the salad, nor do I have that allergy.   We were not told what the problem was that had to do with the phone call to the police, but my wife and I joked about what that ""incident"" could have possibly been, in private after leaving Chili's.  Had Chili's done something similar with another customer's food that just pissed him/her off?   Who knows.   We needed the laugh after our experience.  We do not regularly pick up and leave from a restaurant due to problems.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-39,1.68,1.68,1.68,,1.6800000000000002
12,Chris D.,"San Antonio, TX",77,6,,1.0,2017-06-24,"Hostess didn't greet us at the door, 20 minute wait for our drink order to be taken. Bartender had 4 people at the bar and couldn't take our drink order. Finally the bartender headed in our direction and helped every table around before she got to us. My wife was gone and she asked if I wanted to wait to order till she got back. I said yes and at the very moment my wife sat at the table and she still walked away. 15 minutes later she comes back to take my order. Very unprofessional.  I hate to not tip but this service does not deserve one. And the manager pass my table 4 time and we didn't even have a drink.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-39,1.68,1.68,1.68,,1.6800000000000002
11,Ry M.,"Houston, TX",0,45,1.0,4.0,2017-07-10,We went on Thursday night for $5 margaritas. The service was okay just a few issues. I did have several issues with my margarita(they were out of what I originally ordered then brought the wrong flavor). My salad was pretty good. We got dessert and it was kinda mediocre.  I've also ordered carry out several times and had a few issues. One time they completed forgot my sides and were kinda rude when I brought it up.

The service was really good Out waiter was nice and attentive.  I had the Quesadilla Explosion Salad, ehhh lacked flavor but it was very filling.  I was very disappointed on our drinks, we both ordered one of their summer drinks, the watermelon cooler. It was sweet and refreshing BUT it had no alcohol, basically agua de sandia (watermelon water).

40,Cecilia R.,"Spring, TX",0,1,,1.0,2017-07-17,"Visited this location for a happy hour bday celebration, 1 server for the entire bar area made it very hard to get additional drinks we were not allowed to order any drinks directly from the bar which did not have any guest. The waiter was trying his hardest but you could tell he was very stressed. At the end when it came time to pay 1 of my guest card was declined and instead of telling her quietly he pretty much told the entire bar area very embarrassing for her. Also we were told to quiet down which I would understand if we were in the dinning area but we were not we were in the bar area which I feel should be expected to be a little louder.
