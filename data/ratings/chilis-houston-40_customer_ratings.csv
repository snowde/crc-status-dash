I like Chili's for their quick lunches, but when service is being really slow it defeats the purpose of coming here. I had a coupon for free chips and queso so that was a plus. Food itself is always good. You know what to expect from each one and they are all pretty much the same. They have some pretty good margaritas and you can definitely taste the tequila in them.

And my fries were lukewarm as if they had been sitting on the counter for a while.  Although they weren't busy, there were dirty tables around us. The server didn't bring me a refill until I had given up and was about to leave.  Overall, the main problem was the fault of the kitchen.

5,Alexander W.,"Houston, TX",999,708,5699.0,2.0,2016-05-09,"Where do I start with this review of this chain restaurant?  Well, if you follow my reviews, you know that I do not expect anything fancy or any bells and whistle when I go to a chain restaurant.   Most chain restaurants are just a 3 star experience.  You don't expect much, and normally, that is what you get.  This Chili's was below the norm on almost every aspect of the dining experience. This particular location of Chili's started off my experience with your normal jubilant greeting upon arrival, and my party was seated promptly.  No problems there what so ever.  The server came around and was friendly and took the drink orders and gave us time to look over the menu.  The strawberry lemonade tasted like it was made with recycled gym water.  Asked for a lemonade, and to my server's credit, she brought out the lemonade, and a Sprite with blackberry in it.  Both of them taste like depression and sore throats.  I finally just settled on a regular Coca-Cola, which came out tasting proper. The party ordered the following: Big Mouth® Bites - 4 mini burgers with applewood smoked bacon, American cheese, sauteed onions & house-made ranch. 2 order from the 2 for $20 menu -  Appetizer - Spiced Panko Onion Rings & Tostada Chips & Fresh Guacamole Entrees - Half Rack of Original Baby Back Ribs served with home-style fries, twice, 6 oz. Classic Sirloin* and Cajun Chicken pasta I asked to add grilled shrimp to both entrees for $3 more per plate.  The 2 for $20 deal is an excellent buy.  1 appetizer to share and 2 full entrees for a set price.  Plenty to choose from as well.   Well, the chips, guacamole and salsa came out rather quickly.  The chips were fried correctly, thin and lightly salted.  I forgot that the onion rings were ordered and it came out a considerable amount of time later.  Those salty chips really got me needing a refill...and where is the waitress?  Onion rings come and the refill comes a little later.  Onion rings were decent for onion rings...nothing really special. The entrees come and I have to ask for refills again.  Wait...that isn't our food...please still bring refills though! Our food come for real this time, and our drinks are half full from the wait...and everything looks good.  I'll spare you all of the details, but the following mistakes were made: I asked for my steak to be medium and it came out well done.  It was sent back to be made again...I eventually gave up on it coming to the table and just asked them to give it to me in a to go box. For the big mouth bites, barbeque sauce was asked for and it never made it to our meal...I mean NEVER! They forgot to add the shrimp to the orders. We constantly asked for refills and asked for the forgotten items...but just realized we were just the forgotten. All in all, I was not expecting the food to knock my socks off.  It is a national chain and the food was as expected...when we got the food we asked for...which sometimes was NEVER.  This chain has to do better.  The place wasn't even packed!  No excuse is legitimate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-40,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32

She didn't even tell me my total she just extended her hand for payment. She went back to the kitchen left the salad on the counter and went back to the kitchen.  So I waited for her to come back to let her know the tortilla chips that come in the salad I had requested for them to be on the side. She comes back and I mention it to her immediately said oh that wasn't on the order I said I requested it on the side she went back and forth with me arguing about if it was on it or not.  She finally went back to the kitchen to get me some tortilla chips comes back grabs my bag and said look I can show you. I had to stop her from grabbing my bag and still wanted to argue with me that it wasn't on the order on her computer system. I just replied to her look it doesn't even matter anymore. Even leaving out the door she was still arguing so I asked her for her name she said ""Ellen"" I said okay. Still arguing she yells out "" You don't have to worry about me it's my last day here"". No wonder she was acting like that.  I went back to my car and got my receipt to find a phone number to the restaurant it was no where to be found so I went online and found it called Ellen answered again I asked to speak to the manager she put me on hold and nobody ever answered.  I have never been treated like that at a chillis restaurant.  Never will be back to that one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-40?start=20,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0

Too bad the initial meeting wasn't better because the food was pretty good and the waitress was nice and attentive.

2,Matt G.,"Houston, TX",23,50,61.0,2.0,2017-05-23,"When I arrived, my other party had already ordered the appetizer and their meals.  I immediately ordered an iced tea and requested a menu.  When I decided on my meal, a smothered burrito, we began chatting about the evening's event. It took over 45 minutes for the appetizer (Texas cheese fries) to come out.  Just prior to the fries being served, the manager approached the table to assure my party that the fries would be there soon and would not be served with the entrees, a pet peeve of my party. Other than not receiving my salsa as ordered until we tracked down a food runner and requested it again, the rest of the meal was uneventful.  The food all tasted fine.  Drink refills were done timely.  The server, Tiffany, checked on us regularly during the meal.  And although service was initially VERY slow, I still left a tip because I really don't know who's fault it was for the extreme delay of the appetizer. In summary, good food, busy area, personable service, and possibly a long wait... take your chances but don't be in hurry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-40,1.88,1.88,1.88,,1.88

The waitress (Young Hispanic woman) had the worst attitude I've ever seen in the customer service business. I was so disappointed in my service although I got some items taken off of my ticket I can never get the amount of time I had to wait back.

Once I was greeted, the hostess was very dry & not friendly at all. I was seated at a dirty table & I didn't have a waiter for 30 minutes! The waiter that finally came to the table didn't apologize for the delay and when I asked for the manager, Eric Estrada he was very rude and unprofessional.

First of all chili's got my order all wrong I asked for a bacon cheeseburger and they gave me a classic cheeseburger and it was not done. I'm sick and I'm disgusted with chilis. My hamburger patty was totally un cooked. I spoke with the manager and she said she will give me a gift card for my order. I'm still upset I'll never eat at this location again.

1,John D.,"Harlingen, TX",27,1,,1.0,2018-01-10,Arrived and was greeted by the host. They said it would 30-40 minute wait. Looked around and they had areas sectioned off so I asked why it would be that long with all these tables open. Her response was that did have enough people to tend to those tables. We sat in the bar and the bar tender was all by herself tending the whole area. There was a female manager in purple shirt just walking around not even trying to assist with them being short handed. The female bar tender did a great job by herself with all she had to tend.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-40,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92
