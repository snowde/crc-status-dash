They didn't bug me to order, they just checked on me and refilled my drink. When we did order, they were very quick with our food. The club sandwich was fine and better than I expected, but I did have low expectations. The restaurant was clean and the parking was easy.

45,Thuy D.,"Houston, TX",3,9,,1.0,2013-12-30,"I can't express how poor of a dining experience we had at this Chili's. We came in for a late lunch after having not eaten all day and ready for any sort of meal. We left wondering how this place even manages to remain in business. The one star is not for the server or the atmosphere. Our waitress was polite and upbeat, and well the atmosphere was typical of any Chili's. The one star is for the completely unsavory and unappetizing dishes we received. It was as if this particular location had given up on its sense of good taste due to its popularity and safe haven amongst the well known brand of the restaurant chain.  We knew what we were getting into but didn't expect it to be that bad. To start off, the soup we ordered lost all of its appeal soon after we started eating. My chili tasted like it came from a can that they didn't even bother to microwave. Her loaded potato soup actually tasted fine for the first few minutes before it congealed into a thick lump of cheese.  The appetizer (artichoke dip) was actually enjoyable, which was a surprise since we were unsure if anything was still palatable after having eaten the soup. The main entrees were a disappointment, however. The bread from our sandwiches were stale; the fries were stale; and I swear at that point, it felt as if even the water was stale. The chicken was under-seasoned and dry. It tasted like a cardboard patty in a cardboard bun. Perhaps everything only tasted that poorly due to our now lost appetite.  If there was a single modicum of good taste, it would belong to the dessert (which I had to beg my GF to try in an effort to salvage such a disappointing meal.) While not the absolutely best, it certainly could have been much worse. The molten cake with the ice cream on top was a nice change of pace in such a pitiful meal.  And they say that hunger was supposed to be the best seasoning; well, I guess we were just not hungry enough. Not even if we had been starving for days.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-44?start=40,1.8600000000000003,1.8600000000000003,1.8600000000000003,1.8600000000000003,1.8600000000000005

I ate at the bar since I was alone.  Seemed like a film of grease on everything; not clean.  There were papers strewn all over the bar (old newspapers, napkins, printed papers like receipts, etc.). Bartender was completely uninterested in me as a customer.  During my meal, he failed to bring me water, cheese, extra salad dressing and chopped onions as I requested.  The bartender was in a foul mood.  He smiled at no one and spoke to no one including the manager and waitresses.  Hey, I don't like my job either but I don't punish the customers or my co-workers.  The manager frequently appeared behind the bar and spoke very LOUD!  His best story was that he was going to fire Cody the next time he came in because Cody was diddling one of the waitresses on the job (Cody: if you read this before your next shift, no need to return). Then the manager and bartender proceeded to tear bar equipment apart.  They had no tools and as far as I could ascertain, no skills either.  Cue sweating, pushing, shoving, grunting, etc. The food was substandard.  I ordered a bowl of chili (their namesake, right?); it was poor.  Tasted like it had been prepared last week and microwaved just before they plopped it in front of me.  Very stale.  Side salad was OK; at least it looked and tasted fresh.  Not much of it on a small plate.

The food was solid, not fantastic, but it was Chili's and it was good for Chili's food.  My dessert was delicious.  A cookie in a skillet with ice cream on top.  Man that was good. The place gets 3 stars for 2 reasons. 1.  Scummy clientele.  Not so much the restaurant's fault, but I grade on my experience at the place I go and too many scummy families letting their kids scream and run around, kick my chair, and scream and run around.  If my waiter would have called out the scum parents he could have done himself a favor with me. 2.  Lying Ziosk.  They put these things at everyone's table called Ziosks, google it and you can read more.  You can pay money to play games (babysit your child, like I wish these 2 sets of scummy parents did), you can order dessert, and you can pay your bill.   Me and my wife's bill was 29.95.  It asked me how much I wanted to tip.  I generally tip 15% and this ziosk tried to convince me that 15% of $29.95 was 5.20.  That is false.  15% of 30 is $4.50 and I immediately identified this.  I gave my waiter (solid not great) his 15% (which is tried to tell me was 13.8%), but due to the fact that they attempted to lie to me with these false tipping ziosks I have no intention of going back.   Steal and lie to someone else and cater to scumbag families, I'm done.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-houston-44?start=40,2.0600000000000005,2.0600000000000005,2.0600000000000005,2.0600000000000005,2.0600000000000005

I mean, it's a Chili's, you can expect pretty much the kind of service and food that you would expect at a Chili's. The waiters at this location definitely did not make an attempt to make my experience there more enjoyable nor did they suck. I haven't dined at any Chili's location in a while, so I'm not sure if all Chili's locations have this little screen at every dining table. You can look at the food menu, drink menu, order desserts, and even pay for your tab. This little device pretty much rendered the wait staff kind of useless. And this is exactly what I mean when I said that our waiter didn't really try to wow me. He was barely there. I usually get the chicken crispers when I dine at Chili's. However, the last couple of times, my meal had come with corn in a little bowl instead of corn on the cob. I used to LOVE the flavor of Chili's corn on the cob, but the corn in the bowl doesn't have that distinctive delicious Chili's flavor. Yeah, I'll dine here when I'm craving Chili's and so will you.

58,Heather F.,"Richmond, TX",0,10,,1.0,2015-08-02,"They deleted my review right after I published it on their website. I came in with my son and ex husband after his long flight from Paris at around 11 pm. We chose Chillis because my eight year old son loves Chillis. There were many empty, clean tables yet we were told we had to wait 15 minutes. The food took forever to come out. Funny how at all the other Chillis I've been to they're always packed yet they get your food out fast and you receive spectacular service. I have had wonderful experiences at the Lake Jackson, Katy, Sugar Land, Clear Lake, Pearland and Webster locations, but not at the 77057 location. The waitress asked my table if we needed anything and I said I had no water. She rudely stated I just had to ask for water. I've never had a waitress be rude to me and I'm almost forty years old nor have I ever complained at a restaurant or received bad service. I asked for the manager because there's no way a waitress is getting belligerent with me. The manager Sean or Shawn (not sure how he spells his name) comes out and is even more rude than the waitress and unkept. My son said both him and our waitress ruined his appetite and ran to get a card from the front that has the real manager's info on it. I will be calling her on Monday. To top it off my son said the waitress made an obscene hand gesture in my face. Thank goodness my head was turned and he waited till we got in the car to tell me. Absolutely unacceptable on all levels. I would never eat here again. The food was not up to par either like other Chillis. Just because it's not Eddy V's or Perry's Steakhouse doesn't make it okay to treat a sweet customer like me or any customer for that matter that way.

Why don't the servers know things like that detract from the tip? SMH. As long as I can flag down the server for a refill when needed, it's not a huge deal since I just want a quiet dinner with my son, and he's very easy to please.  I like their rewards system.

When we got there, the restaurant looked pretty empty, so I was thinking this should be a quick in and out trip especially since all we ordered were two salads. Boy was I wrong. Despite the lack of people dining there, the staff took their sweet time getting to us. We managed to wait at least 15 minutes before getting out food and leaving. I had even timed it because I didn't want to leave the house too late in case the food was already prepped and waiting for us to pick up. In the end, that didn't matter because there was still a wait no matter what.

This one is near home so we have been a handful of times, and they never have enough staff to be attentive or get us seated in a timely manner. There is always a fifteen minute wait even when the place is quiet and not busy.  Today was the last straw. Our server only looked at my boyfriend and I once or twice throughout our entire time dining. Most of the time he had his neck cranked back, watching the football game, making comments about it. He got our order wrong because he was on auto pilot and assumed we wanted a steak with grilled avocado on the side instead of the steak and avocado entree which has different elements to it (like tomatoes and sauce.) The way he rang it up also cost us more money. The food that we got was good. The steaks were the right temperature and everything else was good. I wanted to leave a review, but their self pay kiosk was down because of hurricane Harvey aftermath. I would recommend if you want this type of food to go to an Applebee's nearby instead.

When I wake up this morning and check my account, i see 1400 of my Plenti points were taken even though i didn't actually place the order. The biggest problem is when I called the location to speak to them, The manager wouldn't give me his name and HE HUNG UP IN MY FACE!!! I am sure all of your calls are recorded. I called today around 1p.m. and I am sure you should be able to find the call. I am a fairly regular guest and I just wanted my points back. I will not dine at this location ever again.
