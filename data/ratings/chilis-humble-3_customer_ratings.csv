49,John C.,"Kingwood, Houston, TX",28,121,,2.0,2012-07-13,I have to be honest up front.  The only reason I ever come to any Chili's is because my wife likes it.  The food is uninspiring and probably a bit overpriced and the service is hit or miss.   The best things about the place is the location so convenience is the draw in my opinion.  The decor can be nice when they keep up with it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-humble-3?start=40,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44
55,Liam B.,"Houston, TX",0,1,,2.0,2012-09-07,"No one expects Chili's food to be good (at least I hope not). However, even when you're just expecting mediocre food, don't order To-Go here! I ordered a chicken wrap and it came with EIGHT fries. I am not a person who eats a lot, but the only reason I go to Chili's is because of the good fries.

57,Kate S.,"Smithfield, RI",18,23,9.0,1.0,2013-05-31,"Seriously, this was the worst Chili's experience ever. We were seated and waited, and waited, and waited. A manager and two servers looked at our table but no one came by. It was 5pm on a Thursday and not busy at all. Finally the hostess came by and asked us for a drink order. We asked about drink specials and she said she did not know and that she would check. She walked a few feet over to the manager who said ""happy hour"" but only at the bar. She came back with the news and we simply ordered water. A few minutes later, she came with the water but no straws. She walked away before we could ask for any. Finally, a server and the manager walked over. The manager told us that they would give us the happy hour specials even though we weren't at the bar. My partner asked what the specials were, and he stumbled on the answer. He kept repeating ""Uhh, $3.99 house margaritas"". He walked away and we ordered. Our chips, salsa, and ranch came out fairly quickly but the ranch tasted like it had gone bad (specifically the mayonnaise base). Two minutes after our chips came out, our food was there. The food was terrible. You could tell that the oil used to fry the chicken crispers was burnt and the fries were just terrrribbblle. They were obviously frost bitten. We asked for a new set and they were the same. We realized after we got our second set of fries that we did not have any silverware. It look 10 minutes for the server to come check on us. In a busy restaurant, I can understand the wait. But the server only had one other table (she told us).  We high tailed it out of there and sent a message to corporate. To sum it up, slow service, bad food quality, and an overall terrible experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-humble-3?start=40,2.308,2.308,2.308,2.308,2.308

Our appetizer was the onion strings and I ordered chicken crispers and my husband ordered ribs. The ribs were taking a while to come out, so our waitress brought us out chips and salsa for free while we waited. I ordered water, but when I told her it tasted weird and wanted a tea instead, she also gave that to us for free. I've never had such friendly service!

Staff was very courteous, helpful and prompt with service and drink refills. Food was decent. Sweet potato fries were great! Cons: Restaurant was absolutely filthy. Not just post lunch un-bussed tables, but greasy grime and dirt all over everything!  Host cleaned a table for us to sit but watched him only wipe off the top of the table. Fries and other food items on the seat, floor and window sill. The on table drink menu was disgusting!  Had our baby with us and used some baby wipes to clean it - honestly looked like we just changed a dirty diaper. Table edges were sticky and dirty.

They also have vegetarian options.  Service was fantastic. Our waitress was very attentive and cheerful. I told our waitress that my sister and I were splitting our burger. When she came out with our food, not only was our burger cut in half, but each half was on a separate plate with the fries split equally. Usually chains will have all the food on one plate, give you a second empty one, and let you struggle with trying to cut through a messy burger.   What I really want to rave about is Ziosk. It's a tablet at your table that you can order from as well as pay for your bill. In a rush to pay your bill, but you can't seem to find your waiter/waitress anywhere? Have you ever had a waiter/waitress tell you they can't split a check? That they can't possibly split the check based on items? Fear no more, because you can do it all with Ziosk from the comfort of your own table.  Chili's, you da real MVP.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-humble-3?start=20,2.416,2.416,2.416,2.416,2.416

Typical chain feel - fajita meat was salty, baby back ribs were tough/over cooked and had little meat. The salsa tasted like it just came out of the freezer (cold) and it wasn't really what you expect from salsa in Texas - it was more like tomato paste. The guacamole likewise tasted bland and not fresh (obviously like most of the food it was pre processed). The restaurant itself needs some TLC.

Now, this particular chained restaurant I banned myself from since I got food poisoning from the one in La Porte/Pasadena area.  However, since my boyfriend was choosing the restaurant this time of course he would choose this chained game jive.  We both settled for the 2 for $20 couples meal deal and ordered some food. First we ordered an appetizer of chili queso with chips.  David warned us that the kitchen would have delays, so our appetizer may be arriving late. We were both fine with that.  After about 25 minutes of chatting with Wayne and making small talk with David, our chips, salsa and queso arrived.  Then, our main meals of: bacon burger, cheesy fries and mashed potatoes for Wayne and my mango-chile tilapia.    We immediately ate our meal and everything was delicious.  The mango-chile fish was a bit spicy for my tasting, but the sweetness of the mangos chilled my tastebuds. A long with a pair of cilantro rice and steamed broccoli.  I don't like broccoli; but the taste of it was crunchy and nutritious. The cilantro rice was lightly seasoned.  Wayne enjoyed all his food.  One thing, I didn't like was that the hostess/host placed us in a ""child's playground"" nothing, but lots of screaming loud babies near our table. It was quite unpleasant to enjoy the first half of our meal, but thankfully as the night got deeper in, those family-friendly people left.  The parking is well off; I spotted a spot right in front of the window we were sitting at, so I could view Betsy.  The ladies restroom was clean, but the middle stall had no toilet tissue.

18,Wired Wrong M.,"Porter, TX",0,32,34.0,2.0,2016-12-11,"We arrived for dinner on a Sunday around 7:15pm or so.  We were given a 20 minute wait time; however there were empty tables everywhere.  As we were waiting, I went the the restroom to wash my hands & the restroom was filthy.  Our server was nice.  Everyone at our table was unsure if our server was a man or a woman; however he or she did a great job taking care of us.  Our food wasn't bad, but I just can't get over how filthy the entire place was.  There were tables that needed to be bused, the floor just felt gross to walk on, we sat next to a window & there was corn on the window sill & as I already mentioned, the bathroom was really filthy.  In my opinion, the short comings of this place boil down to poor leadership.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-humble-3,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48

10,Kim G.,"Humble, TX",0,18,,1.0,2017-03-04,"We were ""greeted"" by hostesses that not only can't even smile but don't know how to communicate with guests.  Drones would have done a better job. We were seated with menus and waited a long time for our server to show up (probably 7-8 minutes).  When he finally did show up he was in a huge rush and just wanted to get our order and get going. We ordered drinks, appetizer and our entrees.  In a reasonable amount of time the drinks and chips for the queso showed up, but no queso).  At least 10 minutes went by without our appetizer.  We didn't see our server at all during that time and couldn't get the attention of anyone else. Finally he came out with the queso (no apology for the delay).  And then, you guessed it within 1 another server showed up with our entrees. We told the second serve he might as well take the queso away since it was too late now since our meal was being served.  He stared at us, put down the entrees, did not take the queso and said ""I'll get your server"".  Then under his breath he mumbled ""not my problem.""   That was the final straw and we left the table and went to one of the zombie hostesses and asked to speak to the manager.  She just stared at me and said, ""yes, we have a manager"".  Well may I speak to the manager???? The manager arrived we explained the situation and she made no attempt to rectify the situation.  We left and will never go back. Chili's used to be a fun place to grab a quick meal.  Now it is run and staffed by people who obviously hate their jobs and want to be anyplace else.  Their poor attitudes, lack of professionalism, and general incompetence all add up to an horrible experience for the customer who ultimately is paying to be treated as a guest.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-humble-3,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
16,Staci O.,"Houston, TX",15,2,,1.0,2017-03-12,I went to the one in Humble and it sucked never will I go back.  The waiter had way too many tables and our food took forever.  When I talked with the manager he told me that ribs take longer and when you have more people it takes longer.  Well that was a God dam lie the people around us had got steak and ribs and came in way after us and they got there food before us and had three people and we had four and the people other side of us got there food before us and we order at the same time.  So you tell me what is wrong with this picture.  So there is no star for this place The manager had more excuses instead of fixing the problem.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-humble-3,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
6,Cate W.,"San Antonio, TX",7,36,17.0,1.0,2017-05-10,"I think all those screaming kids were trying to warn us! This was the dirtiest restaurant I think I've ever eaten in--and I'm not a squeamish restaurant patron. The floors were layered in filth that looked months old. Tables had trash and food underneath them. The manager came and moved two tables together for a large group and no one even wiped them down. My husband and I tried not to think about how gross it was after we got back to our motel. That lasted for about five minutes until my husband suffered from firehose diarrhea that was definitely Chili's-related. We were staying here by the airport before catching an international flight the next morning. We figured that Chili's was a safe bet. Think again, travelers. You can get the same experience from eating heat lamp burritos in the dirtiest truck stop bathroom you can find.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-humble-3,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24
17,S O.,"Houston, TX",0,4,,1.0,2017-05-28,"It's so bad that I reactived my yelp account to write this... Worst food I've ever had at a chilis. Steak was not edible, beer was from a keg that was months old, and the staff didn't seem to care about anything. Charged for playing games at the table without being prompted by the machine.

14,Alex M.,"Humble, TX",45,76,52.0,3.0,2017-06-02,"It's always a hit or miss with this spot in regards to customer service, but the food itself always hits the spot. One of my favorite food because of the variety has to be the appetizer trio. I always get it with the 2 burger bites, the fired pickles and the boneless wings. This appetizer is an entree itself. The bar ambiance is decent. If the customer service would always be great I would give 5 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-humble-3,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16
20,Brooke D.,"Lake Worth, FL",0,14,1.0,2.0,2017-06-08,"Really disappointed with this chilis. They were out of so many things that we wanted to order. We didn't receive several things that we even asked for once our food was brought to the table. Food quality was very poor as well. Burger was burnt on the outside, nachos had so much seasoning that they were inedible. Manager did stop by to apologize which was nice. Still a bummer. Maybe will try the chilis down the road next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-humble-3?start=20,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08
12,Beth S.,"Kingwood, TX",28,2,,1.0,2017-07-04,"And so now I remember why we stopped coming to the Chilis in Humble. First, both girls pasta dishes were cold. My cheeseburger had pickles and a very mushy tomato on it which I had asked them to hold. Brought the burger back. Had put the BBQ sauce on it which I asked them to hold. Burger was not cooked as requested. And to top it all off the French fries were cold.

Service was horrible, we ordered our drinks and appetizers.... our waitress came back to get our food order.  About 10-15 min later we received our food, still no appetizers. I said to waitress who brought the food (not the one who originally was helping us) that we hadn't received our appetizers yet she got an attitude and slammed the tray back down and said so what, you want me to send it back? Then proceeded to slam the black table thing on the wall.  I can see why they only have 2 1/2 stars.... service is horrible.

4,Lauren K.,"Beeville, TX",0,20,15.0,1.0,2017-08-13,"It's always something when it comes to this chili's location. Me and my friend came here on a Sunday afternoon and stood at the entrance waiting for someone to at least acknowledge us. There were other people there too waiting. The hostess was slowly seating people and had a horrible attitude. If she really doesn't want to be here she should go home..  We both ordered waters, and the 2 for $22, and ordered as soon as the waiter came to our table. It took what seemed like forever just to get 2 waters..i dont understand. It's not even busy in here! Our waiter was very polite though, and kept our glasses full and was apologetic about the wait. When the food came out it was good. Just wish someone would've greeted us upon entering.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-humble-3,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92

3,Michael D.,"Houston, TX",169,50,50.0,3.0,2017-09-24,"Chilis is always a good spot for lunch especially if you come in as a pair and get the 2 for $22 special. On this particular night i wasn't hungry and my friends weren't sure if they were hungry, but we knew we wanted to get some drinks. Fridays is our usual go to spot and it was closed after hurricane Harvey. So we get to the bar area and they have tables available and we are greeted pretty quickly. We put in our drink orders and they came out in a timely manor. We had two frozen margaritas and one peach margarita. They were tasty and had a great consistency, and no chunks of ice.  We needed a minute to order, so our server gave us a minute or should i say about 10 minutes. I honestly don't know how long it took for our server to get back, but what i do know is that my drink was more than halfway gone and my friends were good and full off of their drinks. So when they did get back around we were ready to pay out. Now that i think about it i should've at least gotten another margarita to see if the margarita consistency is consistent or nah.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-humble-3,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0

He is the worst server I ever had. He brought us the wrong drink. Then our food was wrong. We didn't see him for awhile,and when we did see him,he was playing or sitting down. We didn't get refills. He have the worst attitude about stuff he did wrong. I ask to speak to a manager. I'm sure he never went and told a manager that we needed her or him. A manager never came.
