6,Mark J.,"Hutchinson, KS",3,6,2.0,3.0,2013-07-12,"Good food and is comparable to most Chili's.  As far as service, it is also comparable to most Chili's and has much room for improvement.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hutchinson,,,,,
8,Melissa R.,"Hutchinson, KS",0,8,,1.0,2013-10-10,We have been going here for years. Today however is the last time. I had the fajita trio.    The quality of the food has dropped below that of McDonald's! My shrimp was under cooked. The chicken was cold. The steak was stringy. The entire dish had no flavor.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hutchinson,,,,,
7,Steve E.,"Hutchinson, KS",2,9,1.0,1.0,2014-10-13,"Back to Chili's. Not my choice. Once again sloppy service, poor quality food, and overall a very poor experience. They seem to never learn.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hutchinson,,,,,
4,Torey G.,"Washington, DC",12,35,11.0,4.0,2014-11-07,"You can tell you're in the Midwest when your beer choices range from Bud (barf) Lite to the ""classy"" Sam Adams stuff. Food's good though, and the service has been pleasant for me so far. It's another meh in a sea of mehs, but a safe choice for friends/family.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hutchinson,,,,,
5,Stacy W.,"Lewisville, TX",0,5,,1.0,2014-12-25,"I have been a fan of this establishment for years, however, it seems that this location fell short Christmas Eve.  I expect the food to be consistent with every other chilis.  Sadly it was not.  The bartender was lack luster, when I sent food back for being burnt she told me she was taking it off my bill because I did not  Ike it.  It was not because I failed to like it, it was because it was burned.   Christmas Eve meal best left to family......not here",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hutchinson,,,,,
3,Amber '.,"Hutchinson, KS",10,2,,1.0,2016-05-08,I first came to Chilis last year 2015 and fell in love with the chicken sandwich. Since then I cant tell you how many times Ive continued to eat here and time after time they mess up my order. Its gotten so bad that I actually check my food before I leave and 9 times out of 10 they mess my food up. I call and complain and its always the same response. Now today on Mothers day I order to go and check my food when I get in the car....well its messed up once again. Took it in to have it fixed and was told it will take 20 minutes to fix....not to happy and seriously done eating at this location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hutchinson,,,,,
2,John R.,"Hutchinson, KS",5,13,4.0,4.0,2016-11-16,My wife and I ate there on 11/15/16. She had the old timer burger and I got the beef enchiladas. I've had the old fashioned cheeseburger in the past and it's very good. I'm very picky about enchiladas and I think these were as good or better than any I've had in central Kansas. I will get them again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hutchinson,,,,,
0,Gary B.,"Hutchinson, KS",7,95,117.0,4.0,2017-01-30,"Great dinner tonight at Chili's. I really enjoyed the enchiladas, others at our table had hamburgers, chicken and sandwiches, everything was great. Our server did an excellent job with our group of eight.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hutchinson,,,,,
1,Phillip M.,"Dallas, TX",9,6,,1.0,2017-12-17,"Horrible service. My mom and aunt went and the management and staff were rude. The manager said ""if you want respect from me them I expect respect from you "" then happens to tell them that they can eat somewhere else. This is not how you treat your customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-hutchinson,,,,,
