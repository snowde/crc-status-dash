8,Jeremy B.,"Indianapolis, IN",105,61,7.0,4.0,2012-07-11,This chili's is always a good place to go and the wait staff is very friendly with the guests and children not to mention the food is pretty good for a chain restaurant,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-indianapolis-5?start=20,2.576,2.576,2.576,2.576,2.576

3,Mike S.,"Indianapolis, IN",59,119,40.0,4.0,2014-02-20,"Went for lunch today.  I didn't realize they had so many choices for 6,7 and 8 bucks for lunch specials. Pretty decent array of food.  I have the southwestern bLT on a pretzel bun, which was delicious, but even better was the loaded baked potato soup.  Yum!!  If you're looking for a low cost, delicious lunch choice, stop at chili's .  Who knew?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-indianapolis-5?start=20,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.48
6,Scott M.,"Indianapolis, IN",3,114,48.0,3.0,2014-02-25,"CONVENIENT, BUT JUST OKAY (EMPLOYEES OUT-PERFORM MANAGEMENT) Our experiences at this Chili's all depend on who we get as a server or bartender. Individual employees make or break this place, because the management team is non-existent... and most issues are training issues.  The kitchen staff is good, so the food is usually worth the time and money.  Even though its in a good area of Indy, there are problems on the parking lot. A few cars have been broken into lately. Sadly, during the most recent incident that occured while we were there, the manager on duty was more concerned with sweeping up the glass than comforting the victims at all... and it would have helped had he had the outside lights on that night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-indianapolis-5?start=20,2.412,2.412,2.412,2.412,2.412
5,Danielle Y.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,3,,2.0,2014-03-14,"My boyfriend and I came here for dinner a week ago and our experience was bad enough that I can't see returning to this location. The hostess was probably the most socially awkward person I have ever met. I just wanted to put my name in as there was a wait for a table. She tells me I can go in the bar, but only if I'm over 21. I tell her I am, but not interested in sitting in the bar. She proceeds to bring up the age thing multiple times. It starts getting so uncomfortable that I almost walked out right then. I informed her I didn't want to sit at the bar, or even drink, and that I just want to put my name in. She finally takes my name but at this point I'm annoyed at the strange and uncomfortable start. Once we got seated things got a bit better. Waiter was on top of it and food was good, but that hostess was painful to deal with.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-indianapolis-5?start=20,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003
7,Bryce M.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,1,,1.0,2014-03-20,"HORRIBLE service.  Sat at the bar for 10 minutes with no bartender.  Hostess had to go find him.  Had to ask me several times to repeat my order because he kept talking to other people.  He forgot my appetizer, my dinner was wrong, and then he decided to argue and raise his voice as if it was MY fault.  I walked out and told him he could eat my dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-indianapolis-5?start=20,,,,,
33,Tim T.,"Noblesville, IN",17,4,2.0,3.0,2014-10-07,The fried pickles lack a good finished product. Was not impressed. I also had the southwest Mac and cheese. Yum! Chicken crispers and fries hit the mark for what I expected. My server Chris great personality.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-indianapolis-5,,,,,
23,Rick G.,"Indianapolis, IN",316,413,41.0,4.0,2014-10-15,"Although I normally try to stick with independent, locally owned restaurants, that's not always possible, due to timing, or someone else wants a meeting here.  For a chain, I believe Chili's is far ahead of the pack. Every time we've been here, the service has been quite good.  The servers are friendly, professional and know their products inside and out. The burgers are VERY good, and when I request a burger cooked medium, I get a burger cooked medium. All in all, an above average experience.  I wouldn't exactly call myself a ""regular""....but we do dine here on occasion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-indianapolis-5,,,,,
22,Stacy P.,"Indianapolis, IN",107,717,370.0,3.0,2014-12-10,"So Chili's is a chain, but damn it, sometimes you just want to eat and you see a familiar place that you know what you to expect regardless of the location. While there is no gluten free menu, they do have an allergen menu by dietary restriction. This can be found on the little digital stand that is on the table under the Apps section.  The selection is pretty decent, and the food is ok. Like most restaurants, there isn't a separate cooking area, so there is a risk of cross contamination.  If you are just wanting to catch a game, there are plenty of tvs throughout the restaurant that provide you the opportunity to do so if you chose not to sit in the bar area. Overall, its a decent option if you find yourself in between the Keystone/Castleton area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-indianapolis-5,,,,,
31,Scott H.,"Indianapolis, IN",65,389,2.0,2.0,2015-01-20,"I ordered a ribeye steak with cinnamon apples and skillet mashed potatoes. The potatoes were burning hot, but the steak was cold. I miss their country fried steak, which is no longer on the menu. The food is good. The prices are okay. If you eat here during the weekend, do NOT sit in the bar area. I'm not sure how Chili's service is structured, but when the restaurant is busy, the bartender will disappear for up to ten minutes at a time. Frustrating. The service is good unless they are busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-indianapolis-5,,,,,
2,Laura T.,"Fishers, IN",2,15,8.0,5.0,2015-03-10,"I had a great experience getting Chilis for the entire family. Online ordering is easy to use and very convenient. We got a party platter with chips, salsa, and queso. The service was impressive! Everyone I encountered was friendly and helpful. They did not seem inconvenienced by my $88 order and even offered a drink to go. The food was pretty good! I enjoyed the grilled veggies and we were given a large amount of tortilla chips. The queso wasn't my favorite but still enjoyable. The rice was bland but it worked when mixed with everything else. My 2 year old nephew couldn't get enough of the black beans! The platter feeds 6-8, we fed 8 adults and 3 toddlers with leftovers. Overall it was worth the price. The customer service definitely sealed the deal!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-indianapolis-5?start=20,,,,,
4,Phyllis S.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,1,,1.0,2015-08-17,"Horrible service, manager didn't apologize or even acknowledge that the service was terrible. Was there 2.5 hours and never ate!!!! Will never go back. DON'T go here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-indianapolis-5?start=20,,,,,
25,Machelle E.,"Indianapolis, IN",7,2,,2.0,2016-01-05,"We did a carry out order which we have done several times with no issues.    This time we got there right at the time they said the food would be ready only to find out they gave another customer our order.   They gave us the option of getting the order or leaving.   They never offered to pay for the meal or even give an option for next meal discounts.   What they did was give us a $5 coupon and minus one meal.    So as you can imagine I will most likely not do business there again.   Very disappointing on the service side, but for the food we did receive it was very good. I expected more from a restaurant where we eat often.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-indianapolis-5,,,,,
32,Michael S.,"Indianapolis, IN",35,20,30.0,1.0,2016-01-23,"The only thing worse than the food was the service. Wow. We weren't served for nearly 40 minutes, food was terribly overcooked, just a bad experience all around. Won't be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-indianapolis-5,,,,,
28,Susan C.,"Indianapolis, IN",140,24,8.0,2.0,2016-02-13,"Did a carry out order- I admit I was running late, was 20 mins late to get my order.  When I got in there the guy asked if I was who I was- then processed to comment that I was late, felt like I was being punished. We go and sit all the time and love their food- never a bad meal.  But I maybe thinking about going back for a while.  To bad cause I love their salads.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-indianapolis-5,,,,,

29,Jared F.,"Fishers, IN",0,4,1.0,1.0,2016-04-20,"Tied for worst service I've received this year at any restaurant. Decided to go on a Wednesday after receiving an e-mail about a burger special they were running, and I was hungry for a burger, so we decided to go to Chili's. We both ordered the burger & fries special, and neither of us was very impressed with it.  As far as burgers go it was pretty mediocre.  Better than McD's, but worse than Red Robin.  The fries weren't even hot.  But hey, for a cheap burger and fries I didn't have high expectations. What really ruined it was the complete lack of service.  Refills on fries?  Nope.  Refills on drinks?  Nope.  We literally couldn't get ANY service.  Couldn't even flag down a waitress.  After we got our food they were completely absent and never showed up again.  The pay at the table thing was an absolute lifesaver, but it was out of receipt paper so I couldn't even get a receipt.  We ended up hunting around the restaurant to find a to-go box on our way out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-indianapolis-5,,,,,
0,Kimberly P.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,10,9.0,1.0,2016-05-08,"CUSTOMER BEWARE!It was Mother's Day, we were seated. We had a lady yelling into the kitchen asking for her food now. It took 30 minutes  for another (not our) server to see us still sitting. She wanted to provide details for the trainer server not doing her job and it was our servers first day. We finally got drinks twice before ordering food. It took another half hour to get our order taken. Our server was too busy to even notice us as she was too busy giving discounts to the table behind us. The only table she served the entire time we were there.We finally got our food however my steak was over cooked and the chips were stale. I was very disappointed. I would have left however, we knew other places were booked.For $50.00 I should have cooked steaks on the grill. We will not go back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-indianapolis-5?start=20,,,,,

26,Jane S.,"Indianapolis, IN",2,7,,1.0,2016-07-19,Chips & salsa good as usual.  Steak fajhitas not so good.  Some of the tortillas were dried out.  Meat very tough.  Raised their price & bought lesser quality of meat.  Won't be ordering that from here again.  Also took a long time to get our meal.   Good server.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-indianapolis-5,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004
30,Sarah S.,"Indianapolis, IN",15,23,1.0,1.0,2016-07-27,"Gave this place another shot.. big mistake!  Even worse service than before. Took a good 20 minutes for server to acknowledge us, a LONG time for the food to come out, and at least 40 minutes to pay the bill.  My dad didn't even get what he ordered (I guess 2 menu items were similar) and the server ARGUED with him over it and then asked my dad.. ""You good?""  Clearly this place is understaffed.. our server was literally RUNNING around.  Won't be giving this place anymore chances from now on. Go to the new Luciana's across the parking lot.. or literally anywhere else, even go to Chick-fil-A and you will get better service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-indianapolis-5,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88
24,Dan P.,"Indianapolis, IN",3,33,,1.0,2017-01-14,"An absolute circus! My dad and I walked in and there was no hostess to seat us for at least a minute. Then when someone finally came we said we were gonna sit at the bar area and they said ok. We sat there for over 15 minutes without anyone coming to our table or even get us waters.  We look around at the staff and each staff member has a blank look on their face like they have no idea what they're doing with their lives. So naturally we got up and left, and on the way out the hostess just starred at us as we left. Absolute circus ran by a bunch of clowns.

17,Josh E.,"Lawrence, IN",6,105,43.0,4.0,2017-07-21,Chilis is one of those go to restaurants. It's one of those places that you go when no one can agree on one thing. Because they have a nice variety. Obviously the 2 for 20 is amazing. The chips and salsa with ranch is the best thing ever. I am sad that they have gotten rid of a few things on the menu but the basic stuff is all still there. The service has been slacking a little as of late hence the only 4 star review. But hey let me say it again..... chips and salsa!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-indianapolis-5,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72
15,Erin M.,"Arcadia, IN",273,136,126.0,2.0,2017-07-31,"The server was overwhelmed, and luckily we were not in a big hurry. Our drinks were never re-filled, and the food was below average. The chips and salsa were good for the appetizer. The margaritas were terrible and we didn't even finish them. I would not recommend Chilli's to anyone, but I wouldn't be opposed to going back.  Their menu is huge and overwhelming. I would prefer a smaller menu myself, just because I like to decide what I want quickly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-indianapolis-5,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
21,Jason B.,"Carmel, IN",0,2,1.0,3.0,2017-09-12,"I enjoy coming to this restaurant because I love the fried pickles. They were great as always. I went out on a limb and tried something new (the margarita grilled chicken). The picture of the dish was AMAZING however, the actual dish did not look good and it was DRY. The manager came by and checked on me (which was nice) and I told him I was fine (which I wasn't because I was struggling to eat the food...smh). I was going to leave it at that but then when my server (Terry) checked on me I had to be honest. He told me he would give me a dessert but I didn't like any of their desserts. The manager adjusted my check (which was a nice gesture) but I'm leaving the restaurant (after ordering an appetizer and an entree)...wait for it...HUNGRY!!! As a former restaurant manager, that would NOT have happened on my shift...smh! I still left my server (Terry) a 25% tip because he was really nice and had no control of the horrible presentation and taste of the dish. P.S. I ate the chicken BECAUSE I WAS HUNGRY!!! I was also NOT looking for a free meal before I entered the door. Don't order the margarita chicken because you will be disappointed!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-indianapolis-5,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56

16,Dani J.,"Indianapolis, IN",26,155,351.0,5.0,2017-10-18,"I use to love Chili's. It has been around for a long time. With so many options now, I haven't been here in a few years, but I finally made it back. I immediately noticed some changes with the menu, and food presentation. I stuck with the honey chipotle chicken crispers, fries, and corn on the cob. The meal was presented on brown paper on a tray, with my fries in a cup. I liked this new change. My food was good. I also tried a bowl of chicken enchilada soup since it was a chilly night, and a blueberry pineapple margarita($5 special!). Both were great. Everyone in my party enjoyed their meals. The side pickles that come with the burgers are tasty as well. Our waiter was attentive, and the manager also stopped by to check on us. They now have the option to pay at the table, which is convenient. However, when asked about donating to St. Jude, and error message popped up, so you're unable to donate. Hopefully, that was a temporary error. Anyway, I've never had a bad experience here no matter how far between visits.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-indianapolis-5,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
