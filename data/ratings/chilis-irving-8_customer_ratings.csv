After our meal I spoke with a manager about our experience. He couldn't have cared less. Told we were regular customers & had come to dinner that night because it was my daughter's Birthday & she wanted Chili's.

39,Rae C.,"Fort Worth, TX",92,308,31.0,3.0,2012-08-04,"This Chili's is like every other Chili's that was ever a Chili's. If you know you like Chili's, then this Chili's will certainly meet your expectations. I only came here because my friend had a gift certificate, but definitely clocked in a lot of happy hours at Chili's when I was younger and lived in a town with significantly less choices. If you are looking for a happy hour, I would say the happy hour here is decent but they have a minimal beer selection. They do have a good selection of liquor and obvs have the margaritas they would like to be known for, so you'll be in business if either of those things appeal to you. In my personal opinion, the noise level can get a little obnoxious from the TVs, but I'm a big stick in the mud who doesn't care about watching sports while I drink. I was able to read a book while I waited for my friend, but it took some extra powers of concentration which would be hard to maintain after a drink or two. I am now realizing that I sound like a grumpy old lady, but I have decided to blame Chili's for that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-irving-8?start=40,2.444,2.444,2.444,2.444,2.444
28,Dave F.,"Irving, TX",2823,163,37.0,3.0,2012-08-11,"As I sit at the peak of Mount Texas, I have been taught to stay in the moment. Consider all things. Life. Existence. Death. The grand circus.  We exist in this world as a temporary shadow in the tripping of eternity. Everything we do, own, create, build and love is all borrowed from fleeting moments. I take a breath. And another. Another.  And I see balance in the cosmos.  Ying cannot exist without yang.  From the blackness comes the light. Everything is relative and Universal Law works never-ending balancing it all. As I see a hawk circle above looking for prey, I realize something more than profound: Chili's is the nexus of all restaurants.  It is designed to please the most people, regardless of race or nationality.  Their menu is derived from a law of averages considering all ingredients and recipes by popularity. And it very well could be God's favorite restaurant. Of course, in a world of infinite harmony, no dish is stand out or spectacular; That would disturb natural order.  Don't expect a meal you'll either hate or love. At Chili's it's simple: You go in hungry. You go out full.  Universal balance achieved.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-irving-8?start=40,2.476,2.476,2.476,2.476,2.476

59,Curtis P.,"Simi Valley, CA",35,31,,1.0,2013-10-14,"The worst restaurant experience I have had in a very long time.  It took 5 minutes to get a menu, 15 minutes to get water (after I asked the hostess to bring it to us) 20 minutes to get our soup (they don't need to cook that do they? just scoop it out of a pot) and after 45 minutes we left without getting our lunch. We arrived with our almost 2 year old.  We ordered and then waited.  It wasn't particularly busy but I waited close to 10 minutes and didn't see a waiter or waitress in the section we were ONCE, even though there were 8 tables with people at them.  Since I asked the hostess to get us water she let the manager know.  He stopped by shortly after our waitress apologized but said that she wanted to get out meal in the computer right away so we wouldn't have to wait.  The manager apologized and mentioned something about taking care of us.   After getting our soups, which weren't bad, we waited, and waited and waited.  After 25 minutes we gave up.  Luckily, our flight was delayed, because between the 45 minute non-lunch and all the construction in and around the airport, we definitely would have been late. I think the most disappointing part of the experience was the waitress who didn't take responsibility and the manager who said he would take care of us, but failed miserably to follow through.   I only pray that corporate reads yelp reviews, but based on the staff we ran into there, I doubt it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-irving-8?start=20,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116

72,Danielle L.,"Plano, TX",67,66,107.0,1.0,2013-11-11,"I went to this Chili's this past Saturday night.  We got there at like 7pm and there was no one waiting in the waiting area. The hostess did tell us that the only booth she had available was in the bar area. At first we were apprehensive because we didn't want to get lousy service but figured what the heck. So we are seated in the bar area and wait.  We sat there for a good 10 mins before any server was to be seen. I asked my bf if there was even a server in this area and he said yes I have seen one lady. So this lady finally gets over to us and proceeds to tell us how her and Jennifer would be helping us this evening. Ha that's a funny one. We ask for 2 waters and ask her if it is OK to place our order since we had a feeling she wouldn't be back for a while. She says of course. So we decide on the two for $20 deal with the appetizer. We order the flat-bread as the appetizer and I order the Margarita Grilled Chicken entree which I have had several times.  We then sit there and wait. No drinks to be had for 30 mins!!! Are you kidding me?  Still noticing that our server is the only one working in this area. Where is her sidekick Jennifer?  So finally my bf gets up and goes to the hostess and explains to her that we still haven't even gotten our drinks. She looks at him like she doesn't understand English and then says I'll let my manager know.  Finally the hostess comes and plops down 2 waters. A few minutes later the manager comes over carrying our entrees. He apologizes for the wait and places them on the table. I thank him but also mention that we had ordered an appetizer. He says Oh I am sorry, let me go check on it. So now we proceed to eat out food. First bite into my chicken and it is cold! Ugh. Then I realize that there is no rice on my plate! Just black beans a piece of grilled chicken and some pico. Are you kidding me??? I pull out the menu just to double check that they didn't take the rice out of this dish but there it is in writing and in the picture. So finally about 10 mins later the server comes by to apologize to us about our flat-bread. She said somehow it got lost in the kitchen. Um OK. I then tell her that I didn't get any rice. She apologizes again and says let me get you some.  A few mins later she comes back to say that they have run out of rice. Wow!! So you don't tell anyone when they are ordering dishes that come with rice?? I would have ordered something else. This entire dining experience was a disaster! So now are done and I am barely full. The manager comes over and says that he is so sorry for all the mess ups this evening and proceeds to tell us that there is no charge. (Um there better not be!!) He then also says that we can sit here and wait for our flat-bread to come out but he doesn't think that it is coming. He said he believes it had fell on the floor. Um what?? I then asked, so our 2nd pizza was made but then it fell on the floor? He says yes. I am so sorry. LOL!!! Wow!!

I'm 53 and I can honestly say that it was one of the worst and most bizarre food experiences of my life. I'm guessing they get their chicken for this dish from DuPont or Dow.

When we walked in we saw that there was a issue with the grill being down however most of the menu was still availible. My friend ordered the lunch chicken fajitas and I said I would have the same except I would have beef. The meal was small and we each got 3 shells for our food. They took about double the time it should have taken and the food was bland tasting. We ate the food and were ready to pay when we found out that I was being billed for a dinner meal and on top of that a additonal charge for beef. After the 2nd overcharge I asked for the manager. She showed me several times that the beef does not have a lunch meal to which I responded that is what I ordered though and no one told me it was not a option. They just gave me a dinner cost plate and added 2 additional charges for beef on top of that. I understand wait staff can make a error. We are all human. My main issue was that the manager did nothing about it besides take a 1.50 off a 20$ bill. I told her to leave it and I will pay however I was upset and will not comeback. It's not about the money people. It is about getting ducks in a row and when you mess up make it right. Disappointed!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-irving-8?start=20,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44

The music was SO loud and so was the bartender as he yapped to anyone in close proximity. So we asked for seats on the other side of the restaurant. Although there were other patrons seated outside the bar area, the girl who ""escorted"" us acted like it was a big bother. She sat us at a cramped two-seater behind a ridiculous podium.  My food (Mango Chili Chicken) came out COLD. I tried to let the server know but he raced away so quickly I didn't have the chance. I managed to flag down the manager who was busy giving her undivided attention to one particular table for some reason (a mom, dad and two kids - mom was wearing a Chili's t-shirt - coincidence?) and she simply said ""I'll get you a new meal"". So I was forced to sit and wait while my companion's food got cold. Unacceptable.   Manager comes back with my food and says she's not leaving until she's ""sure the meal is perfect this time"" and waited for me to take a bite. I said I didn't expect perfection, just a hot meal. No offer to knock anything off the bill for the inconvenience. Well, this is where things really got ridiculous. The food was so SPICEY I couldn't even eat it. I looked at my companion and we both said ...did she take the food to the kitchen and say that it wasn't ""hot"" enough so they added more chili?

The tropical sunset margarita was more like a juice, so if you want something on the liquor side don't go for it. The food items were excellent in taste. Margarita grilled chicken especially was very well made and excellent in taste. Usually Strawberry Lemonade at chilis is very smooth and fresh. The staffs were friendly and inviting.
