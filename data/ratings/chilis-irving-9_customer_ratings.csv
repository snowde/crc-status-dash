Why we come: low cal menu makes my stress of finding food within my calorie counts vanish.  Even during peak times, we've never had to wait more than 5-10 minutes.  Service at this location has always been good and efficient.  Food is good value, especially if you go with the 2 entrees and an appetizer for $20.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-irving-9?start=20,3.0520000000000005,3.0520000000000005,3.0520000000000005,3.0520000000000005,3.052000000000001
29,Jason L.,"Irving, TX",13,15,7.0,1.0,2012-08-20,"I went here last Saturday and had a terrible experience. Our waiter was all over the place and just didn't to seem to have time for us. Granted, there were two different tables in the restaurant celebrating birthdays for their kids but that doesn't mean I should have to wait 15 minutes to get a refill on a Sprite. It sad when you have to chase down somebody like you work there. By the way, if you know you're going to sing a birthday song to some kid because it's part of your job then being obnoxious as possible while you do it really makes for a awkward experience for people who are just trying to enjoy their baby back ribs. This actually happened twice within 20 minutes of each other and trust me, the second show was even louder and obnoxious than the first show. Order our food was also a hassle because the original waiter that took our order and wrote everything down and walked off and about 10 minutes later a new server came over an indicated she heard some of what we ordered from our previous server but he said he wasn't really paying attention and to just go ask us again. My first question I was thinking after bein told was, ""Then what was the guy writing down on the notepad? Doodles?""  This was not the first time my experience was unpleasant and I won't be dining inside anymore. The 'to go' area is quick and friendly and I fully recommend that. If you really want to eat inside then I suggest going to the Chilis in North Irving in the Los Colinas area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-irving-9?start=40,2.8840000000000003,2.8840000000000003,2.8840000000000003,2.8840000000000003,2.8840000000000003

Because they have made some exciting changes at this location (and possibly others - I'm not a Chili's frequent flyer). My beau and I came in on a Sunday after church and we were pretty lucky to grab a spot in the bar without a wait. Larger parties were waiting to be seated and restaurant was buzzing, but there definitely was some space for smaller parties. We were quickly given a crash course on a new system called Presto that changed what would be an average dining experience for the better. Pretty much, it's a self service tablet where you can view the menu, place orders, and even pay for your meal when you're ready. It is so stinking easy to use and really a fun concept! It also has games and other features for tables with kiddos. I hope that more restaurants will start to use this system (or something like it) in the future. It's a pretty nifty feature and sets the well-known Chili's brand apart.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-irving-9?start=20,3.088,3.088,3.088,3.088,3.088

They have new flatbreads that are to die for! The crust is perfectly crisp and the basil pesto taste soooo good! And no food poisoning three times eating there ;) The new Presto tablet type thing with the games, and you can order on it and pay was amazingly fun and nice to have. Perfect for impatient people.

Our waitress Naomi was so great keeping our bottomless chips and salsa full, bringing extra napkins, plates, and drinks. She was on top of things and the food was great!

It was 40 minutes from the time we were seated until our food arrived.  I was watching the tables around us and it was similar for everyone.  My wife ordered the mango Talapia and when she took a bite it tasted like pinesol or some other cleaner.  It was in edible and we has the general manager ""josh"" come over. He claimed to not be able to smell it at all so I guess we were both crazy. Yea I took a bite too. Had to spit it out.   Told the GM we would not be back for awhile.  On the flip side, I love the Chili's in Flower Mound. It is always good, fast service and the staff are very friendly.   I'm sure this is a case of the GM and how he cares about his customers. Sic.

Server was hurried and somewhat friendly. Food was good. We had a voucher and needed to pay our server but had been told to use the new machine. However it's not equipped with the ability to accept it. We waited almost 5 minutes for someone to return but just ended up grabbing a manager. He was fabulous. Very friendly and helpful.

All the busy Chili's I have been to have two bartenders and even they were sometimes overworked. And it would be nice to get a smile instead of the look of panic from a server.

However, when I asked her to have a server bus the dishes off an open table, the hostess refused and said it wasn't her job, and a server would do it when they get around to it. Since there was no sense of urgency I proceeded to put my things down anyway and waved at the bar server for assistance. Before I could even sit, a different hostess stopped me and said she could not seat us unless the table was cleared, and she would get fired if she allowed it. Excuse me, but didn't the other hostess say the bar was open seating? Because of their incompetence, I literally picked up my things and walked right out.

It took forever to get our food and of course, it was all room temperature upon arrival.  Hmm,  I wonder how long our food was sitting in the window ready? This obviously effects the flavor. Even blah food can make it if it's hot and you're hungry as hell, as I was tonight.   I ordered chicken fajitas, cadillac style. Where do I begin. Chicken was minimally flavored. Rice was hard, seemingly undercooked. Despite awesome sounding fixings - pickled jalapenos,  guacamole,  sour cream, salsa, Pico de Gallo - my fajitas proved significantly underwhelming. I only scared them because I had entered into a hunger - induced irritability. My other plate on the ticket was a triple dipper consisting of chicken crispers, sw egg rolls and big mouth bites. All room temperature damn near reverting to its frozen taste. The bartender was overwhelmed by the drink orders coming in though she was decent enough. For $30, it reaffirmed why I don't really ever eat at Chili's. It's been years since I've been there and looking at their new menu I was impressed but my food told the tale.

I decided to split the 2 for $20 deal with a coworker since there were a few of the ""lighter options"" on the 2 for 20 menu. Tried the Mango chile tilapia which was somewhat salty but otherwise okay.  I paid $1 more for the fresco salad and that was disappointing. for my second side i chose broccoli which was the best part of the meal.  The other entree was the 6 ounce sirloin - absolutely terrible. Extremely salty and almost completely gristle. The other person who ordered it tried to cut around the gristle but gave up since there was no actual meat within. So we switched. Officially the worst piece of meat I have ever eaten. They also had the beans - extremely salty. We ordered the guacamole as the appetizer. If you are betting I will say salty then you would be 100% correct.  For $27 with tax and tip it is safe to say that I will be avoiding chili's in the foreseeable future.

18,Gracie G.,"Irving, TX",76,10,3.0,4.0,2015-12-23,"I have been to this Chili's twice very recently and I have to say, the staff is so positive and friendly, it makes me want to come back! I was particularly impressed with our waitress, Brandi; she was very upbeat and had just the right balance of not interrupting our conversation but being around enough to be helpful. Thanks to the waiters and waitresses, this Chili's is a really happy place.  The quality of the food is also quite good; you always know you'll be happy with what you get. The reason I didn't put 5 stars is because I think in general, Chili's has really gone up in their prices - It used to be affordable (but not trashy) family dining. Now it's quite expensive! I went to lunch by myself and paid $17 for a pasta plate and a soda. :( That being said - You get what you pay for, in a good way - Very friendly, accommodating staff & satisfying food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-irving-9,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96

We ordered an appetizer which took forever. I was hoping it would not come with our entrees but it did. It defeats the purpose of munching on something while waiting.  The food was average.

1,Courtney V.,"Anaheim, CA",0,5,,1.0,2017-11-13,"If I could, I would give zero stars. This place makes me want to never eat at any Chili's ever again, and I won't. Angela Fox, I would highly suggest you train your staff before your restaurant loses business and shuts down for good because I see it going in that direction if my experience is anything to go by.  My family and I just had dinner here. We're not super picky or finicky but the service here was just horrendous. Right off the bat, we were seated at a booth where the seats were wet, which made my pants damp. I got up and my sister asked our host if we could have some napkins. Rather than offering to wipe down the seats for us or getting a server to come with a dry towel, the host named Jason, gave my sister a single napkin. You heard that our seats were wet and so was our table. What were You expecting us to do with one napkin, Jason??? So my sister asked if we could have a few more, and he sarcastically grabbed a large stack and asked, ""Is this enough?"" Okay, whatever. We let that go. There was food on the ground which my sister tried not to step on.  Our server (I didn't get a name) took our orders and brought our food but never once returned to our table to offer refills or napkins. It's not like the restaurant was full. Where did he go? Why didn't he bother to check on us at least once when we needed napkins and got to the end of our meals with empty cups?  Maybe we should read the reviews on here before dining. Angela Fox, I got your name off of the door where you're listed as the General Manager. Please take these reviews seriously. Train your staff and have them clean up the place. I'm very surprised that nothing has changed because it seems like others on here have had a similar experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-irving-9,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
