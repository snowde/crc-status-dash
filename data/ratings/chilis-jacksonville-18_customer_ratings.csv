Dinner service was timely, with drinks out within a few minutes.  Wait staff was friendly.  Salad was ok, nothing special. Croutons were crunchier than I like but ok. Very little shredded parmesan on the salad, little more would have been good.  Got the steak, ordered medium rare and it was very rare with almost no sear on the outside. They put butter on the top and I could see the lack of sear. Wound up sending it back and they really screwed it up by overcharring one side and still no sear on the other side. This was probably one of the worst steaks I have ever been served.  The skillet potatoes were pretty good. I would say stick with the other menu items but stay away from the ribeye. For $17, it's a really bad deal since they don't know how to cook it.

13,Amy S.,"Jacksonville, FL",1496,1714,17389.0,4.0,2015-10-26,"My husband and I eat here pretty frequently.  The first time we came here, we sat in the bar area and service was awful, our food order was completely screwed up, and I would have only given it one star.  I'm glad I gave them another chance because they haven't screwed up since.  We also haven't sat in the bar area since.  They have tried to convince me to sit in the bar area and I refuse.  My strong advice to you if you are reading this:  DO NOT SIT IN THE BAR AREA!  Wait for a table in the dining area. Other than that first visit, we've had a really good experience all other times.  We've had a different server each time and they have all been friendly and on top of things.  Food has arrived hot and correct, and our drinks have stayed filled.   They have a 2 for $20 thing which is what we usually order.  You get to choose an appetizer to share and you each get to choose a dinner entree (unless you get pasta, most come with sides).   We always get the texas cheese fries which are covered with bacon and come in a skillet.  Two thumbs up on those.  I always order the same dinner entree which is the 8oz sirloin.  I have it cooked medium and it's pretty cook.  It has a nice flavour.  It's a little chewy, but then again, it's a sirloin, so I'm not expecting it to melt in my mouth like filet mignon.  For sides I get the mashed potatoes and corn on the cob; both are good and what you would expect mashed potatoes and corn on the cob to taste like. Their alcoholic drinks are 2 for 1 all the time.  It's like a continuous happy hour.  That's always a good thing.  On the downside of that, they aren't very strong drinks, so 2 actually do equal 1. For dessert, the chocolate chip cookie which comes piping hot in a little skillet and covered with vanilla ice cream is very good.  It's also very, very sweet.  It's so sweet that I can only eat a few bites of it, so I'd recommend sharing if you order one. We are night owls, so we generally come here after 9:30pm.  This means they are slower and could be a reason we get good service.   I also like the fact they have a free rewards program.  You can download the app to your phone and sign up for the program using one of the little Ziosk things that will be on your table.  For every dollar you spend here (not including alcohol, tax, or tips), you get a point.  Those points add up to free appetizers, desserts, and even full entrees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville-18,2.256,2.256,2.256,2.256,2.256

First, why is the first place to sit customers are in the back near the kitchen or restroom.  I think it's unprofessional to sit someone without asking them where they would like to sit, ie. table, booth, dinning area or bar. At the very least, especially when the restaurant is almost empty.  Second, it is unacceptable for the server to come to your table without knowing the basic items on the menu. Saying ""um"" and ""uh"" every other word when the customer asks a simple question is not professional. Third, my food wasn't cooked thoroughly. The chicken was raw and manager of the day comes out and ask: ""You had a question about your chicken?"" Sir, it's not a question, its a concern, because as soon as I get food poisoning, you'll be upset when you get the hospital bill. Also, I had to get my fries seperate because of the server's forgetfulness. Even though they came out hot, my daughter's food did not.

12,De Ann R.,"Jacksonville, FL",34,118,137.0,3.0,2017-07-04,"I decided to stop into Chilis for a quick bite to eat.   I ordered a margarita, smoked wings and guacamole, salsa and chips.  Overall my food was tasty.  My drink ordered and guacamole and chips was brought out immediately. It took over 15 mins for my wings to come out.  However, the wings were very good even though it took a while to come out.  Service overall was ok.   Good happy hour specials.  I will return for happy hour in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville-18,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32

0,Lisa M.,"Westside, Jacksonville, FL",12,50,90.0,3.0,2017-09-15,"After working at chopping up a fallen tree for a friend, We were hungry so the first place we stopped at only had fried food, I can't eat fried  So we continued our search. So we stopped here.  There was only a few people here so it was not loud at all!  We sat in the bar area, ordered our drinks, and asked for more time when she brought them to us, we made our choices then waited and waited and waited finally the server show up we gave her our orders.  My husband doesn't like waiting our salads finally got to the table then ten minutes later our entrees, now there's a dilemma so Noe w we have all these plates and glasses on this not so very big table   I will admit the food was good we went with the 2for $22. Menu. I had the Chicken Fajitas which were really tasty my salad was great , my husband had the Bacon cheese burger with fries, his fries where cold and fries that are not hot are gross but he enjoyed the salad and his burger so other then very slow and forgetful service  It wasn't dreadful........",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville-18,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24
8,Decha R.,"Jacksonville, FL",37,2,,1.0,2017-10-24,If I had a choice it would be zero starts. I love chili's but this location is a no go. My boyfriend and came to this locations a 3 times hoping for better service it just gets worse. All different serves and all do the same thing. My food always comes out wrong no matter what I get if it's the bacon ranch quesadilla or just a burger. I never get refills and the serve seems to never be around. I ask for a side of sauce never get it. Just horrible service and I never got my plenti points.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville-18,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24
10,Roy R.,"Dunn, NC",17,25,11.0,5.0,2017-11-13,This is a clean environment with friendly folks. That should be a necessary starting point for a restaurant....not so in Jacksonville.

9,Daniel M.,"Palm Harbor, FL",0,3,,1.0,2017-11-18,"Tonight was a disaster, the manager at the location tonight November 18, 2017 needs to be fired because he was the most rude and unprofessional manager I have ever seen, not only did 5 Of our party of 20 not receive our food for three hours, till we up and left. He stuck a new server with a party of 20+, never once did he come out and apologize or help out the very nice young lady. Servers who had to deal with his terrible leadership deserve 5 stars, but he needs to go, never coming back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville-18,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
5,Caroline P.,"Downtown, Jacksonville, FL",12,3,,1.0,2017-11-22,If the employee spent half the amount of time they did on their phones attending to their customers and cleaning up I'm sure The experience would be much better. From the time that I sat down there was a dirty dish in the bar that sat there even after I had left. Walked in the bar was sticky waited at least five minutes for a drink to even be offered to me in the food took twice as long to come out. I have never been to a chilies restaurant where it took 45 minutes to get an appetizer of boneless wings. I for sure will not be coming back to this particular Chili's  until the services vastly improved The bartender was more interested in her phone and checking Facebook then she was attending to her customers.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville-18,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32
4,Chelsea S.,"Jacksonville, FL",229,257,109.0,1.0,2017-11-27,"I'm not sure how this isn't an update for this place because I have been here a bunch.... So, first off, I go to this Chili's for convenience and because Jo loves Chilis. My most recent experience was the worst one yet. My friend and I were meeting for a quick lunch before going shopping in the nearby stores. We sat at the bar, usually where the best service is. The bar was FILTHY!!! There was sauce and dirty dishes everywhere. There were at least three employees just standing around on their phones. When we sat down, one of the servers took a stack of bar napkins and ""wiped"" the area. Never once did she clean the bar top. There was a dirty, empty glass that was there when we got there and still there when we left. The place was not busy at the time... Anyway, we both ordered something simple I got the southwestern BLT with a salad and my friend ordered the loaded boneless wings with a side of fries. If we hadn't told the waitress to forget about it we would still be sitting there waiting for these fries!!! Service took way too long and I had to remind the bartender 3 times that I was having UNsweet tea, not sweet tea. Overall, not a great experience. I bet if I texted my order to the server they would have gotten it...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville-18,2.2,2.2,2.2,,2.2
15,Jeff K.,"Lexington, SC",55,10,,1.0,2017-12-07,This location is consistently one of the worst corporate restaurants that I visit.  This week I visited the location with three coworkers and sat at a table in the bar.  It is the holiday season and typically this year for restaurants and they had one server in the bar area which had at least Twelve Tables and all were full. The service was very slow and not attentive at all. The manager on staff would not come to the table despite to attempts to get his attention. when done and took over five minutes to get our checks and then the server took our credit cards walked to one of their registers which is in Plainview sat down or credit cards and then walked away for almost another 5 minutes leaving our credit cards unattended. Again the manager would not acknowledge or requested to come to the table. This location is one of the most poorly managed corporate locations of any restaurant that I've ever went to.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville-18,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08
3,Roland A.,"Jacksonville, FL",15,31,7.0,4.0,2017-12-23,"Had lunch on a Saturday before Christmas at around 11:30am. Was greeted upon entering but I chose to sit at the bar so I can catch the Texas Tech vs USF game. Not that many people there yet. Single bartender working. He took my drink order pretty much right away and since I already knew what I wanted, gave my order. I went with the two meat fajitas. Chicken and steak. It took a bit longer to get to me, which he apologized for, stating a large party came in ahead of me. I was cool with that. When my food arrived, it was well flavored and hot. It came with a bowl of black beans and a side of rice. In the process of eating lunch, business started to really pick up. But he was still very attentive and filled all my requests immediately, such as, more tortillas and extra guac and sour cream. I also didn't have to ask for a refill because he got that covered. By the time i cashed out at 12:40pm, the place was packed, with a waiting list. My bill came to $20 dollars with soda and including tip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville-18,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12

The order was ready when I got there. However, it missing one of my meals so I had to go back to the restaurant. Granted I should have checked all of the containers. When I spoke to the manager I explained my displeasure and received a promise to handle my meal next time. Not fond of promises. Not sure I will return. :( Gee, thanks Tim.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville-18,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12
