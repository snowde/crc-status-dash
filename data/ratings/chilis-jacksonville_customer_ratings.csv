30,Rich T.,"St. Augustine, FL",89,247,122.0,3.0,2013-07-22,"We arrived at Chili's with friends after a day at the Jacksonville Zoo that had turned into a rainy mess just as we were leaving. Seated in a section to the left of the entrance, we worked on the menu, which I thought was a little long. As we all ordered different selections, we made a point of sharing what we had. The burgers were good, the salads were ok, and the chicken was ok too. What we all concluded was the one common thing in the mix we did not care for was the level of salt in everything.  I know that industrial kitchens like Chili's must be ordering from a food service, but the amount of salt was a little much.  I will revisit Chili's again and try out some of the Tequila drinks in the great pictures of the menu, but will suggest in any order from the kitchen that they take it easy on the flavorings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville?start=20,2.284,2.284,2.284,2.284,2.284

BF and I always sit in the bar for the complimentary chips & salsa (we are obsessed w their recipe) and sports. Tiffany is always our awesome server but the last few times we have dined, she has been scheduled in the dining area- PUT HER BACK IN THE BAR!!

14,Athena C.,"Jacksonville, FL",423,179,788.0,3.0,2014-05-29,"Chili's is another chain restaurant who has parked itself on Southside.  We came in and were greeted and seated immediately. Our server was polite and patient as we tried to figure out what we wanted to eat.  The menu is consistently changing so you never know what's on it, but some classics still remain.  We order the frozen 2-for-1 (or 2-for-$5) drinks. Daiquiris for my boyfriend, margaritas for me. The drinks weren't too strong, which was fine by me since I really wasn't looking for strong. Refreshing with a tiny kick I'd say. We went with the 2 for 20. Chips and salsa, 6oz sirloin with fries and corn,  chicken and carnitas fajitas and then ordered the cookie for good measure.  Chips were warm and crunchy. Salsa still runny and hint of spice. Sirloin was cooled well done and my boyfriend enjoyed it, but the corn on the cob was not appealing so he left it. Fries were crispy.  My Fajita skillet was smoking hot with plenty of onions and green peppers (just how I like it) with the meats seasoned well. All my toppings to the side allowed me customize my fajitas to my needs. They were very good. Their spinach dip is always so incredible. So I had to get that, but $8 for the serving you get is almost unreasonable....  The cookie had perfectly crispy edges and a soft gooey center topped with ice cream. Perfect ending...  We left stuffed and ready for bed.  Megan, our server, was attentive but forgot to ask if we wanted dessert before bringing the check... and also they forgot my beans and rice with my fajitas which was fine because I quickly regret asking for the sides... so I was just glad they forgot and reminded Megan to kindly keep that off the check. Hah. She was very sweet and apologetic and made sure we were okay the whole time. She was a lovely server.  Overall, a decent experience at a franchise. But there are definitely no complaints on the service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997
23,Morgan H.,"Jacksonville, FL",51,337,830.0,2.0,2014-12-22,"We stopped by here since we were in the area and had a gift card.  I now remember why we never come here.  First it took forever before we even saw the bartender, like literally didn't see her anywhere for the first 10 minutes.  Then we asked to see a drink menu and were given a new electronic device similar to an iPad to browse the menu on. Seems cool except there are no prices ANYWHERE. Luckily they do offer a printed menu for food with the prices on them.  So we finally place our orders and I was excited to get the half slab of dry rub ribs b/c I saw a full slab on someone else's table but was sadly disappointed when mine came out looking tiny and like they had been boiled not actually grilled/smoked etc. They tasted good. But they just weren't what I was hoping for. My husband had the Club which he described as ""ok"". The highlight was my Blueberry Pineapple Margarita.  When we got our check, we only had $1.98 left on it after it would be swiped, obviously not enough to leave a tip so we ordered 2 shots of fireball. Imagine my surprise when the 2 shots came out totaling more than my rib dinner (???)!!! I won't be back anytime soon. There's much better places to go to eat and drink where I will get better service and prices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville?start=20,2.056,2.056,2.056,2.056,2.056
7,Maya C.,"Jacksonville, FL",208,525,2100.0,3.0,2015-02-16,"This place is meh but it was close and nearby and we were hungry.  I didn't expect them to be busy since it was a holiday and it wasn't. We were seated immediately on the left side near the take-out area. I had forgotten that they had the kiosks now and we only used it to check our bill. We had a new server named Montana (insert Hanna Montana joke here hahaha) who was really nervous but really friendly.  I originally was going to get a Presidente Margarita for Presidents' Day but when I saw the Blueberry and Pineapple Margarita I dropped that idea like a hot rock. It came in a huge margarita glass and that thang was good (but not as good as the Blueberry Lavender Martinis at Bazille).  For my meal, a friend and I shared the Tableside Guacamole with everthang in it. I should have left off the jalapenos because every bite had one in it. I finally decided on the Lunch Combo of the Loaded Baked Potato Soup and the Quesadilla. Sounds more like a snack than lunch. The soup was pretty good but needed more cheese. The Quesadilla was weak. It was very dry and consisted of cheese bacon, and chicken which looked nothing like the lunch menu photo. Instead of fries, it should've came with lettuce, tomato, or pico de gallo and sour cream. I ended up using the fries with my guacamole. My friends ordered the Quesadilla Explosion Salad which also came with a Quesadilla that looked similar to what mine did, a Southwestern BLT and the Fresh Mex Bowl, the latter two being ok. The food could use another face lift here but it's a good place for drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville,2.1559999999999997,2.1559999999999997,2.1559999999999997,2.1559999999999997,2.1559999999999997
13,Michael H.,"Jacksonville, FL",3,22,9.0,4.0,2015-04-11,Ok we are here for lunch doing the $20 meal for 2 while we wait for our movie time. For our appetizer we ordered the fried pickles. My wife ordered the bacon burger medium rare and I the mango Chile tilapia with rice and asparagus. 2 for 1 draft Samuel Summer Draft. -.5 for coming out and not having asparagus after all. It is seasonal.  I can have spinach in its place. Oh by the way 4.5 start. Our server has been very nice and courteous so far. Fried Pickles - Meh ... they are a little too thick cut for my taste. Maybe needs a little more batter or something also. It's a little too wet. She came out and let us swap out for something else without us having to say something.  She asked.  Our entrees came out maybe two minutes after our appetizer giving us no time to enjoy or not enjoy the moment. She did mention that she was sorry that the food is coming out faster than she wanted. Burger is great. Medium rare is medium rare! Excellent :) Tilapia is juicy. Has great dressing on top with avocado and mango. The spinach is delicious.  With garlic cuts and tomatoes! Yummy! The salsa does not taste right. We switched out for salsa and chips from the fried pickles. Something is not right with this batch of salsa. Usually it's the chips that come off wrong like too salty but not this time.  STUFFED! Happy :),https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville,2.256,2.256,2.256,2.256,2.256

16,Tracy D.,"Jacksonville, FL",140,38,35.0,2.0,2015-09-05,"I don't think we will be back here until we've forgotten how mediocre it is again. The server definitely struggled, constantly back-and-forth for things that we asked for and she forgot. Other tables were trying to stop her when she did show up, as she was behind for them too. Not horrible, not good either.  The food just didn't taste good. It wasn't terrible, but it was bad enough that it just wasn't even worth mentioning much to the manager. The tortilla chips came out cold and several were glistening with grease, which I would only expect from hot chips.  The guacamole tasted completely unseasoned and was mediocre. The kids' quesadillas were just ok and made with sharp cheddar, which was a little surprising in a Tex-Mex restaurant. Despite the marketing of bold flavors, my fajitas were also completely unseasoned.  Not only did the tortillas come out completely cold and rigid, but there's nothing to keep them warm now either.  The bacon cheese fries we ordered had fries so old and mushy we couldn't eat them. Our kids normally devour what we ordered at other places, but no one even wanted to take home what they didn't eat.  Aside from all that, something has really happened to the portions.  The guacamole was quite small for the amount we paid for it.  The fajita meat was sparse and made to appear bigger by the huge amount of onions and peppers beneath it. The side items for the fajitas were about 2 tablespoons each, and way too small for the order.  The comical BOGO beers are the smallest I've ever seen, with tall bottoms on the plastic mugs to give the illusion of height. We guess they are 8 oz each.  You also have to get two at one time so the second has started to warm by the time you get to it.  So, don't waste your time here if you care about what you eat and want good value.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jacksonville,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.12

First, we had to wait to be seated even though half the restaurant was empty at 8pm Then our waitress was too busy to take care of us due to having a large party. It wasn't until we flagged down another server that we got help.  Our appetizer didn't show up until after we asked for it after our meal arrived.  I ordered a steak fajitas platter which only came with onions (lacked green peppers) and when I asked our ""too busy"" waitress if it was still cooked with both she said ""it's suppose to be"" and then shrugged it off and walked away.  We only got one water refill, no soda refill.  And I had to flag another waitress down to get a working pen to sign our credit receipt to leave!

This is not the first time I have chosen to use the internet to order food and once again I was greatly disappointed, to put it mildly. This was their last chance and they failed. Okay, so the food was not ready when I got there. I had reward items and had to wait for that to be made, but first the cashier took several calls while I and someone else was standing there waiting. By the time, got the other items and got home, my food was cold. The tilapia was tasted bitter and the fries were could not be saved. There is no good way to reheat fries and make them taste good. I was supposed to have queso and chips. When I opened the container, I don't know what that was that they gave me. It looked like watery chili.

The server tried, but the kitchen wasn't cooperating. The manager came out (a little too late in my opinion) and when they finally did get our re-order,  which should be a whole lot quicker to get since they already messed our food up, but it took an additional half hour. $40 for dinner and my partner didn't even get to eat dinner.

The fried pickles we ordered as an appetizer were also good. The wait staff was friendly. The only complaint I can make is the floor was a little dirty. Like drinks were spilled right under our booth before we were seated and the bussers didn't see it. For it to be so early in the day I would expect it to be a little cleaner.  On a positive note the waitress was great. She kept checking on us and made sure our glasses were full.

Ordered all the food and paid at home, drove up there and sat outside for 5 minutes before I realized no one was coming. Go inside and was greeted by a waitress who asked if I had a to go order. I replied yes and she disappeared. Two different ladies walk out and one says ""Oh $h!t did you have a to go order?

I'm like ""why did you mention it if it's not a sauce for dipping like I asked?"" but it was actually pretty funny. My only qualm is the wait time to be sat. We came in and stood around like idiots for a good two minutes waiting to be seated.

This was another great choice for us, this evening. As we pulled up our seats at the bar the bartender greeted us with great hospitality as if she has known us for years. She shared the 2 for 1 happy hour specials with us which we couldn't refuse. She even offered us some appetizers which we didn't have room for as we've just had dinner prior to taxiing across the street to Chili's for drinks and to catch the tail end of the Jags VS Titans game.
