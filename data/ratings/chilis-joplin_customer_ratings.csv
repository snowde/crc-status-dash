12,Brian Z.,"Joplin, MO",0,1,,1.0,2016-06-04,"This place is flat out awful.   They are not capable of getting orders right.   Not capable of serving the wrong food in anywhere near a timely manner.   And when it finally does get to your table,  it's cold.  Go here if you want to sit around for a hr and half and throw your money away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-joplin,1.924,1.924,1.924,1.924,1.9240000000000002
21,Morgan E.,"Carthage, MO",29,6,,3.0,2016-06-14,"I'm hoping that this review will service constructive criticism as I know that this business is very new. The hostesses greeted us very quickly and the waitress was very prompt, however once we ordered the food took over an hour to arrive. A friend and I got the two dinners for 20 and had to wait an additional 45 minutes for a desert while the rest of our table sat around with us. After finishing our dessert we continue to wait another 20 to 30 minutes for a check to be presented I would understand if this was a weekend that it could possibly get hectic. But this was approximately 8:30 on a Thursday and that adds up to over 2 hours of waiting time. I plan on coming back in a few months after you guys have ironed out the Kinks and hopefully made some improvements.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-joplin?start=20,,,,,
20,Mark S.,"Joplin, MO",0,23,1.0,1.0,2016-06-21,This was the worst restaurant experience i have had in a long time. Waited forever for our meals. 1 hour. Shrimp was over done and heavy with chili powder. The burger was flavorless burnt and  barely warm. The nachos were so bad that my wife sent them back. The nachos were cold and soggy no crunch left. The place was so loud talking was out of the question Only high point was our waitress who was very friendly and polite. After sending back food never saw a manager to apologize.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-joplin?start=20,,,,,
18,A S.,"Southwest, Las Vegas, NV",2,18,3.0,2.0,2016-06-24,Service was alright. Hardly saw our waitress. Seemed like she was in a hurry to be somewhere. Hard to get our order out. We were expecting some nice food. All the food was cold. I thought we would bring kids but I don't think it's worth it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-joplin,,,,,
13,S W.,"Joplin, MO",0,19,,5.0,2016-06-25,"Ten times better than the Pittsburgh, KS location. Most of the servers we have had have been top notch. Especially the girl that looks like Jesse from Saved By The Bell! The food has been very good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-joplin,,,,,
22,Melissa B.,"Carl Junction, MO",6,1,,1.0,2016-06-28,"Gave it two chances. Just awful. We've tried to do the call ahead both times, and they would not take our name due to supposedly they had no wait time. Get there both times within fifteen mins of calling and there's people waiting inside and out. Explained the second time we called about the previous visit, and they still assured us no wait time. Got there, again people waiting inside and out. Both times the food was cold, mixed up, or forgotten. Fajita's came non sizzling on the skillet, and the chicken strips looked like the tyson strips that come out of a bag that you would put on a cheap salad. Had the waitress take half our order, then I guess assume the other three weren't eating for some reason and had to be stopped from walking off to take the rest. Half the staff give off the vibe that they just don't care. Never got refills the second time. Had some of our table get their food after everyone else was half-way done. And no one apologized for it. We're just done with Joplin Chili's. We'll continue to go to Springfield or Pittsburg.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-joplin?start=20,,,,,
14,Dustin O.,"Camp Lejeune, NC",27,5,6.0,1.0,2016-07-29,"Called ahead for seating and was seated on time. Service was extremely slow, it took about 15 minutes just to get waters to drink. The meal didn't arrive for over 1 hour and 15 minutes. This restaurant didn't meet my expectations by any means and is below par. Will not be returning to this location, I'd rather drive the extra 30 minutes to Pittsburgh if I really want Chilis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-joplin,,,,,
23,Dwayne S.,"Springfield, MO",0,2,,1.0,2016-07-29,"First time at the Joplin location, and it was a horrible experience. We had a large party and understood we would have to wait. We used your app to help prepare your restaurant for our group of 16, checking in at 6:30 with a time of getting a table between 7:15 an 7:30. 8:00 rolled around an once again we were told it would be an additional 20 minutes that people were lollygagging at the table that was for us an they just couldn't ask them to leave. The hosted pointed at the table an said see the other half is clean an waiting. We then saw the table that we had been told more then once was ours go to a different group. At this time I talked I the manager an was told it would be an additional 30 minutes as that table was not ours but ours was on the other side of the restaurant.That a different large group had their reservation scheduled right before ours well almost at the same time. So we left an are now enjoying great customer service at Cheddar's who got us a table in less then 15 minutes. Thanks Cheddars for saving our night! Shame on you Chili's! I guess you just don't know how to plan for a busy night or how to tell time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-joplin?start=20,,,,,
19,Chip R.,"Galena, KS",0,9,,5.0,2016-08-26,"The best service and food experience I've had in Joplin to date. Heidi is awesome, so if you get the chance to have her as your server, you are in for a treat.   Our food was perfect and our wait was less than 5 minutes with call ahead seating.   I wish I could give them 6 stars!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-joplin,,,,,
16,Andrew D.,"Joplin, MO",0,3,1.0,1.0,2016-08-27,"My girlfriend and I tried Chilis twice. Horrible both times. 1st time, over an hour and a half wait for cold, unseasoned food. The waiter apologized endlessly and said a manager would be by to apologize. Never showed. To compensate for our wait, they make a big show of making fresh guac at our table, because apparently, a bowl of guac with old tomatoes and some chips makes up for 40 wasted dollars. Second time we come in, thankfully no wait for our table. Waitress was extremely arrogant and rolled her eyes constantly when taking our order. Food comes out an hour later cold and bland again. This time my burger is extremely over cooked. Now, 4 hours later, already feeling sick and think I might need to throw up. My girlfriend can't stop farting and it stinks. Thanks a lot Chilis",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-joplin,,,,,
17,Candice M.,"Diamond, MO",0,6,1.0,1.0,2016-10-15,"Although, the shrimp tacos were good the guac was very bland. The service was less than mediocre. We never were offered refills or to-go boxes-we actually had to get up and seek someone out to get a refill and to-go box. The waitress just seemed like she was in too much of a hurry to care. Earlier in the week we were able to get a corn tortilla fried in the shape of a taco shell but for some reason they absolutely refused to do it again tonight and wouldn't even see if it was an option. Very disappointed. We won't be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-joplin,,,,,
24,Renee' L.,"Joplin, MO",0,17,1.0,3.0,2016-10-17,"Went to Chili's for my daughters birthday because the birthday girl gets to pick the restaurant. There was no wait time since it was a Wednesday evening which was great. As soon as we were seated we asked our waitress about ""Happy Hour."" She stated that if we wanted to go to the bar and order our drinks we could get them at the Happy Hour price but they would be regular price at our table. We turned to look toward the bar area and you could not see it from all of the people. Since it was my daughter's birthday she decided to order a drink that the waitress recommended. When she got the drink she said it was gross. She told the waitress and the waitress said she was sorry and walked off never offering to replace the drink. My daughter and I did the two for $20.00 and my husband ordered the Sunrise Burger. Our food arrived in a timely manner but it was just average. While eating our meal from Chili's we were discussing the Longhorn Steakhouse which is where I wanted to eat. LOL When eating at the Longhorn you can order Happy Hour drinks right at your table along with Happy Hour appetizers plus you are served hot bread. Chili's needs to realize that there is fierce restaurant competition in Joplin. After arriving home and looking at our receipt we realized that we were charged $8.89 for a $6.00 Happy Hour drink that was gross and we were charged $1.99 for entertainment. My husband called Chili's and the manager told him that the $1.99 entertainment charge was a game app we must have hit when paying our bill. He offered to refund the money which was nice. We can pick it up next time one of us is in town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-joplin?start=20,,,,,
11,Valetta M.,"Webb City, MO",89,350,253.0,1.0,2016-11-16,Food was pretty good but the 3 times I've been there the service was TERRIBLE.  There are no napkins on the table so if you don't remember to ask for one you are SOL w/ketchupy fingers.  Each time we were there we paid via the little box on the table because the waitress never returned.  I did however see her sitting at a booth with a nice looking guy to which I say good for her but shame on the manager that allows this to go on.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-joplin,,,,,
10,Mikal S.,"Joplin, MO",49,22,29.0,2.0,2016-12-09,"Was not a very good experience today.  1. Mixed up orders. 2. Food arrived to different ones in our party if 7 by 10 and 15 mins. 3. When our salsa arrived, there were 3 ice cubes in it. When we asked for another one, the server said ""it's up to you""!! 4. Son's salad was brought out without salad dressing, and mine had the wrong dressing.  5. Place wasn't too busy but drink refills were few and faaaaar between.  6. Daughters order was forgott",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-joplin,,,,,
3,Carlos E.,"American Canyon, CA",8,39,5.0,1.0,2017-02-04,"Male server works bar area by name of ""G"" is poor.  Slow service.  Forgets things you ask for.  Food is ok but this continued poor service reduces our experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-joplin,,,,,
15,Patty A.,"Joplin, MO",0,32,4.0,1.0,2017-02-22,"We have gone a few times, because we have always liked Chili's in Broken Arrow OK! Each time we visit this location, the food has came out wrong! FF are always cold or barely warm. I ordered a salad and asked for no tomatoes, it came out covers with tomatoes. I sent it back and they picked most of them off and covered the rest with cheese. I sent it back again and asked for a new salad. Waitress was mad that I wouldn't just eat the tomatoes. Next visit I ordered my burger med rare and it was well done. I sent it back and after the third burger coming out well done, I gave up! I went again today. Ordered my burger med rare and my daughter prefer hers well done. My came out well done and hers was med well pink. Sent both burgers back and hers came out right but mine was well done again. Sent it back again and it still came out well done. Manager kept apologizing, but by this time I am done. Won't go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-joplin,,,,,
2,Kristi W.,"Joplin, MO",2,36,39.0,5.0,2017-03-25,"My husband and I came here for dinner last night, even after hearing all the terrible stories of bad food and even more bad service. Decided to give it a try. Well, our experience was rather pleasant! There was no wait to get in even though it was quite busy. The servers were very attentive and promptly gave us drinks, took our order and our appetizer came out very quickly. The food was very good and our drinks were immediately refilled and dirty plates taken away. I can't remember the name of our server but she was very nice. We plan on coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-joplin,,,,,
7,Mike B.,"Fort Worth, TX",6,6,,1.0,2017-05-15,Love chilis stay clear of this one 3rd visit 2nd time for smoked wings they are awesome never had them at this location because they are always out Monday night no customers so not sure how they could be out service always slow save yourself the hassle go somewhere else,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-joplin,,,,,
9,Jill M.,"Cleveland, OH",0,18,,2.0,2017-06-10,"I ordered a salad and onion rings to go. Once I got to my destination and opened up my food, i noticed they gave me the wrong salad. I also got 4 small onion rings- which i wouldn't quite call a full order. The lettuce in my salad was wilted and soggy. I'll steer clear of this location in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-joplin,,,,,
6,Christopher W.,"Afton, OK",0,1,,5.0,2017-08-04,"Wow. Can't believe I see so many bad reviews. I got to eat there for the first time and it was amazing. I had the steak and shrimp with the honey glaze, loaded mashed potatoes and asparagus. It was all so good and the server was right on top of everything and it had been quite busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-joplin,,,,,
8,Scott K.,"Springfield, MO",8,14,,2.0,2017-09-21,"Tried Chili's in Joplin.  Server was very nice and responsive. The restaraunt was very clean and orderly.  Then there is the food.....the ""Garlic Toast""  was inedible as it had so much Chipotle seasoning on it that you could scrape it off with a knife.  The corn on the cob was inedible also as the seasoning was absolutely awful.  The prices charged for the food was way too much for the quality.  I  can see why there was hardly any customers there during what should be a busy time.  Bet this place won't be here in six months.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-joplin,,,,,
4,Chylea D.,"Neosho, MO",5,3,,1.0,2017-10-12,"Before Joplin got their Chili's we would always go to Pittsburg. Since Joplin opened, the wait time is horrible, service is way below par, and the food just isn't great. Anytime my daughter wants to go to chili's I have to tell her no because again the service and food are horrible. My husband and I went to Pittsburg one time since Joplin opened and we've decided to just always drive the extra time to get good service and food. I think to help this chili's be better their service needs to be better and the food needs to be cooked better and faster. I hate waiting an hour or more for my food every time I'm there. Even when there is no wait for a table you have to wait for the server to finally come or wait an hour or more for your food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-joplin,,,,,
5,Traci C.,"Neosho, MO",0,1,1.0,4.0,2017-10-24,Awesome customer service and good service. Which I would have got a silverware and napkins though. Great food just need to bring back the shrimp tacos,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-joplin,,,,,
0,Tal H.,"Haughton, LA",0,7,,5.0,2017-11-01,"This place must just be hit or miss from day to day. I had lunch there and the service was good. Not fast, but definitely not slow. Seated right away and had iced tea on the table in no time. Waitress was very friendly.  I ordered a burger (as did my brother) and they were both WAY above expectations. Figured I'd get an ok lunch, but it was nothing short of delicious. Their in-house made pickles are awesome and worth the trip on their own! Will definitely go back for lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-joplin,,,,,
1,Magz A.,"Joplin, MO",0,4,,2.0,2017-12-27,"First time here was a disappointment. I've visited other chili's and had a great experience. Tonight I ordered a steak, but pretty sure I received a dog chew toy. Prolly won't be back unless it's happy hour and no food is involved. Chili's menu is all over the place... it's like an Applebee's and 'On the Border' birthed an autistic child/menu. Even if u order to go ur food is not in a secured container, just a plain old box. Chili's needs to kick their game up on a lot of levels to me",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-joplin,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28
