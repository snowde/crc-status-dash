2,Jeff B.,"Jupiter, FL",0,12,,1.0,2012-09-24,Food was average and service was absolutely glacial. Management was apathetic.  We won't be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jupiter-4?start=20,,,,,
1,Peilin K.,"West Palm Beach, FL",6,31,8.0,1.0,2013-12-30,"Not only do they not honor a chilis coupon, my friend got sick right after we ate and was in the restroom for 30 mins.  The food and the restaurant and the servers were just nasty looking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jupiter-4?start=20,,,,,
0,Michael A.,"Jupiter, FL",4,99,9.0,1.0,2014-05-25,"Disgusting. This is the worst Chili's I've been to in my life. If you're in the mood for Mexican food, check out Rancho Chico 1.5 miles North in Tequesta. If you want a burger, head to Burger Bar 10 min south on Donald Ross.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jupiter-4?start=20,,,,,
22,Frank S.,"Jupiter, FL",41,10,8.0,3.0,2015-03-20,"Wait time is not too bad. Even during the busy times  of the weekends.  Servers are also pretty legit! Haven't come across one that was bad, and I go to this Jupiter chilies very often.  Favorite dish: TRIPPLE DIPPER! As a meal!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jupiter-4,,,,,
24,Nicolas G.,"Jupiter, FL",0,7,2.0,5.0,2015-06-24,This is my 3 year olds favorite lunch spot.  The food is like any other chilies but my wife and I enjoy going too.  The table top computer gives the little one something to do - the kiddos grilled cheese and mandarin slices are right up her alley.  Also when we asked for an extra plate to split the quesadilla salad they took the time to plate two halves of the salad for us.  Honestly that was a big win.  Thank you,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jupiter-4,,,,,
21,Sarah L.,"Jupiter, FL",31,1,,1.0,2015-10-20,McDonald's is right next door. Do yourself a favor and just go there. Seriously food was cold and not cooked properly. Tasted horrible.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jupiter-4,,,,,
11,Jim H.,"Jupiter, FL",138,309,443.0,3.0,2016-01-15,"Chili's seems to have become an upscale Denny's. Haven't visited one in a very long time, but my recollection is it used to be better. In their defense, we did order from the ""2 For $20.00"" menu which has limited choices of standard menu items, so a review of the food is fair. This special included one app and two entrees. We started with the Panko Onion Rings with a dipping sauce. Sounds good but were no better than supermarket rings out of a freezer bag. The burger I ordered, although stacked with lettuce and tomato, was tied with a McD's Quarter Pounder, earning a solid two stars. It was all edible but the word good would be a stretch. My wife fared better with a small half rack of ribs. Ribs are almost always good, but in this case, delicious wasn't much of a consideration.  She  did enjoy the dressed up mashed potatoes as a side. The best part of the evening was our server Phillip. He suggested we start with a ""two for one"" local Tequesta Brewery Chancellor beer. It's light but not too light and very crisp and clean. His suggestion was right on, as was his five star worthy service. Clearly Chili's is targeting a lower price point which understandably attracts lots of families with kids. I get it, as taking a couple kids out to dinner can be costly and may take the fun out of it. For us (w/o kids) living nearby Chili's may suit on occasion, when we're eating to live vs eating to enjoy. In a word the food is very average.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jupiter-4,,,,,
23,Bernadette M.,"Port Saint Lucie, FL",0,2,,1.0,2016-01-31,"We usually enjoy the food at any Chili's but we will NEVER go back to this one again. Ordered Bloody Mary's and the bartender clearly did not know what she was doing. Salt around the rim and lemon/limes in the mix. GROSS! Had to chase the waiter down more than once and he appeared to be on drugs - very rapid movements, sweating, racing around the restaurant. Ordered a prime rib taco that was dripping in grease and they forgot the rice part of the rice/beans. Manager could have absolutely cared less. Totally disgusted and couldn't wait to write this review to warn others. Now that I am reading the rest of the reviews, I can see my assessment is right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jupiter-4,,,,,
17,Nicole A.,"East Amherst, NY",0,18,42.0,4.0,2016-03-25,Came here for quick bite before the movie theatre. Service was excellent. Food was average but that is normal for a chain. The service really stood out. Our server was extremely helpful and attentive to our table. Loved the 2 for 1 drink specials.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jupiter-4,,,,,
18,Ed M.,"Brandon, MS",2,85,63.0,3.0,2016-06-07,Had lunch with my wife and the server from Tennessee with the great hair cut made our lunch GREAT!  Food was good but the server made the difference. Thanks,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jupiter-4,,,,,
19,Chris W.,"West Palm Beach, FL",0,3,,1.0,2016-07-03,"Don't bother with ""curbside"". I placed an order for curbside pickup. After waiting past the time my order should have been brought to me I decided to walk in. Upon entering the store I wasn't greeted by anyone and proceeded towards the kitchen. The person who appeared to be the shift supervisor asked me if if was there for pickup. Pretty obvious as I wasn't dressed for an evening out and most of the reason I ordered food to go. I was told that curbside was closed for the night and I needed to go to the bar. I went to the bar and waited another 5 minutes until I was greeted there. I was then told that ""the to go person called out"" and my order should be ready soon. At this time it's 15 minutes past the time my order should be ready (I was watching my ordere being assembled after I checked in at the bar). Finally the same person who told me to go to the bar brought my order to me. I arrived home and found my food to be cold. Not cool, actually cold. I had my wife verify just to be sure I wasn't being unfair because of the experience. I've asked the store manager to call me. Let's see if that happens.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jupiter-4,,,,,
15,Ros C.,"West Palm Beach, FL",7,1,2.0,1.0,2016-07-22,"Horrible experience and terrible management. Restaurant was half empty yet we waited 15 minutes for a table for six. Two of our orders came out wrong the first, go around one the second and one the third. See photos for the final outcome in which we sent back we're still charged for the entire meal with the exception of the raw meat burger and left. Manager was a novice and had zero customer service skills. When I asked for the phone number of the corporate office he advised me that he was not allowed to give it out and I should search for it on line. I suggested a new line of work may be in order. They advertise the best burgers since the 70's but not at this Chili's. Beware!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jupiter-4,,,,,
20,Josh H.,"Wilmington, NC",79,6,,2.0,2016-08-15,"While the bartender was personable, she clearly was too busy to clear off the dishes and glasses from the previous guests. We came in at happy hour and were the only people at the bar yet the mess was there when we arrived and still there when we left...obviously staff and management couldn't care less. I wonder how long our dishes will be on the bar after we leave.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jupiter-4,,,,,
13,A S.,"Jupiter, FL",1,35,39.0,5.0,2016-10-01,Been here often for Saturday lunch and I always have attentive servers and options for kids are great. Enjoy the soup and salad or the lighter options if you want healthy options. Shrimp tacos are great also.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jupiter-4,,,,,
10,Josh S.,"Wellington, FL",32,90,191.0,4.0,2016-12-22,"Some really great people working here very friendly.  We still love the chips & salsa!!! Craft brew selection is not bad at all.  Don't forget about Chilis, they have a huge menu!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jupiter-4,,,,,
14,Jimmy M.,"Jupiter, FL",2,129,,1.0,2017-02-26,Food is terrible. Salty as can be. Quality if very low grade. Grilled chicken like rubber. Not good. At all.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jupiter-4,,,,,
12,Vince S.,"Margate City, NJ",19,11,,4.0,2017-02-28,I gave it four stars for its bacon burger.  Stopped in twice in 3 weeks. No fluke. Burger was great.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jupiter-4,,,,,
16,Olivia B.,"Hobe Sound, FL",0,1,,2.0,2017-06-23,"Usually I tip very well... but today not so much. The restaurant wasn't very crowded for a friday night, yet I received service like it was packed. I had to ask for silverware and napkins AFTER my salad arrived and the server only came by once to check on our drinks. The staff was friendly but inattentive, the only reason why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because of how inexpensive our meals were.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jupiter-4,,,,,
9,Steve H.,"Jupiter, FL",2,18,5.0,4.0,2017-08-19,"Enchiladas are great; better than most Mexican restaurants. I get them at least once a week. Baby back ribs are good too. Molten lava cake is real good. Service is always friendly, and good. Lots of TVs in bar area. Just wish they had Wifi.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jupiter-4,,,,,
8,Angi C.,"Jupiter, FL",48,4,,1.0,2017-12-14,"This by far is the worse experience I have ever had at a Chili's .. usually chili's are pretty consistent across the US, not this one! This is our second visit . I know, silly us trying to give them a second chance. We ordered fajitas my daughters came out cold ( not even a sizzle of the plate) , my meal came 10 minutes after everyone else's.. my onions/peppers were not done .. Our server never came back to check on us, had to ask the food runner to get us more drinks and refills. The manager did come out and apologized and gave us 50% off our 2 fajita meals .. I ate 1 bite of my food and could eat anymore of it, my daughter maybe ate 1/4 of it .. I was highly disappointed as Chili's is one of my favorite chain restaurants",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jupiter-4,,,,,
6,Toomie M.,"Miami, FL",18,148,90.0,1.0,2017-12-29,"A domino effect of problems. Hostess sat us at a table that had juice all over the table. No problem I cleaned it myself. My boyfriend ordered a double jack and got nasty white things all along the side of the glass. SO gross. We ordered the 2 for $20 platter and got ice in our guacamole yuck! Then my boyfriend orders a steak that was raw in the center of the meat. Dirty silverware. On top of all of that I had HAIR on my chips. The blonde manager ""sue"" was the most unhelpful person I have ever met and her response to it all was ""I don't know what to say""  I'm not sure I've had this many problems in a row at a restaurant. Definitely will never return here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jupiter-4,,,,,
5,R.J. W.,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",0,3,,5.0,2018-01-02,"Manager ""Sue"" is outstanding - really goes above and beyond and I can tell she genuinely cares about the guests needs as well as her team's success. It's great to see her in action - no matter how hectic the restaurant gets, she stays calm and does her best to effectively address issues as hey arise.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jupiter-4,,,,,
7,Todd G.,"Delray Beach, FL",4,7,1.0,1.0,2018-01-13,Not good. Chillis is awful. The server basically just gave us drinks took our order dropped our food off and asked if we wanted the check. After that he disapeared for the night. The food wasnt even good how to you screw up chicken fingers. Chilis I will not be returning to this location EVER!!! DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY HERE,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-jupiter-4,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
