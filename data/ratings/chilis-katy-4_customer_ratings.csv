74,Denise C.,"Houston, TX",0,9,,2.0,2012-03-05,"We usually order take-out from this restaurant, however, it had been a crazy day so we decided to actually go in this evening and just relax.  We started to regret it almost immediately.  We were in a section where the only other patrons were an 8-top top table.  It wasn't surprising that they received ALL of our waiter's attention. However, it took 20 minutes for my soup to arrive, and it was the wrong kind and wrong size. The waitress that brought it was snippy when I pointed it out, she asked if I could just eat the one she brought.  After declining, she was yet even snippier and finally took it back.  When I did get the correct soup it was room temperature.  After about 10 more minutes I managed to flag down our waiter and express my disappointment with waiting such a long time for a cold bowl of soup.  He then insisted he had ""just ladeled into the bowl"" and had become busy with the larger table's order and ""thought someone else had taken care of us"".  After I declined the second bowl and told him I would just wait for our entrees, he immediately took it away and then slammed it down on a dirty table behind us.  At this point, I was becoming really irritated with the increasingly bad service and had pretty much lost my appetite, so I sought out a manager and asked that she replace our waiter with somone else.  She was very accomodating and comped my meal and had a very nice waitress replace him.  In my opinion, the damage was already done.  It's hard to justify service like that on a Monday evening when the restaurant was only half full. I wonder how bad it gets when they are really busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy-4?start=60,1.9280000000000002,1.9280000000000002,1.9280000000000002,1.9280000000000002,1.9280000000000004

Usually we get nachos which are not fried properly (due to cold temp of the oil). Tonight was an awful night. We had to constantly remind the waiter about our order and yet he managed to mess it up. To top it all off, after waiting 20 minutes for our food, we were told that the loaded potato soup fell on the floor and they were out of it. So they would have to thaw a new batch from freezer to make some for us. The manager tried to salvage the situation, but the overall experience was just awful. I would not recommend this specific restaurant to anyone esp since such an experience has not been an isolated one. Avoid it like plague.

Then, when I got my meal, my fries tasted sort of stale and day-old which was a bummer because I love the fries there usually!

Someone ""bussed"" our table so we could sit there. The table was greasy, not to mention the cushions of the booth had grease and crumbs stuck to them. So the server comes & takes our drink orders & I never saw her again. She was really busy but no excuse... ask for help. So I ordered pasta with no chicken, it came with chicken and the pasta was disgustingly cold and had no flavor. Couldn't even find anyone to refill my drink. So the restaurant was soooo dirty, horrible service, and food that tasted a week old. I'm not returning that's for sure.

But this place sucks, I stopped going here over a year ago because of so many issues. So Today we decided maybe we will give it another shot... Well it was a Togo order, they cooked the wings wrong not once but twice while I sat there waiting, and my other foods are getting cold. On my salad I ordered avocado ranch, and we ordered 2 big tubs of extra avocado ranch for all the other food..... Guess what we got normal ranch, and some southwestern ranch on my salad. The guy in front of me at the counter, they forgot his ranch all together, and he came back in again while I was waiting because they didn't give him any plasticware. The only reason I asked for my money back is because I will never eat there again, and I drove there got wrong stuff and now have to drive back to get my money back. I have no clue why people eat here, the food doesn't even taste good, just look at all the other negative reviews, it's just ridiculous how this place is still even in business.  I'd like to add after reading other reviews that I also noticed how dirty the place was, and people are saying they have seen roaches crawling between tables on the floor in the middle of the day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy-4?start=20,2.04,2.04,2.04,1.956,2.04

7,Long N.,"Houston, TX",70,118,41.0,1.0,2017-04-13,"I came on a Wednesday night. The go-to place for me is the bar any time I go to a Chili's. I was planning on a late dinner and a libation or two. I am always content with a semi-clean bar and an attentive bar tender. This place had neither... The entire bar top was sticky. Not just my section, the entire bar top =/ The hostess started spraying some sort of ""polishing"" spray to make it better; this made it worse. The gentleman next to me had napkins assembled on the bar top so he can rest his arms because it was so sticky; that was funny. The stickiness of bar tops do not usually bother me because I understand it can get busy but, this was extremely sticky! When the gentleman next to me signed his credit card receipt, he had to peel it off of the bar top and we both laughed. It took 10 minutes for the bartender to get to me with a total of 3 people at the bar; not entirely his fault because it looked like he had to take care of the tabletops in the bar area as well, but there were only 2 tables... Once he got to me he was a nice person and had a good attitude. I ordered a drink; it took awhile for the drink as well. After this, I decided I was not going to dine here tonight. I drank my libation, asked to close my tab, waited 5 minutes for my bill, waited another 10 minutes to pay with my card, waited 5 more minutes to get my card back, signed my receipt, and got out of there. I will not be coming back here. Chili's on Fry rd. is a better option if you're hankering for some ribs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-katy-4,2.12,2.12,2.12,,2.12

On another note, my niece ordered the shrimp Alfredo pasta. Although my niece did eat most of hers, she had six shrimp left and she bit into one and it was completely raw. The only difference is that it was covered in Alfredo sauce. So, lied to my niece's face and said she only had two shrimp left.  They had already taken the plate, so she forgot to take a picture. Sandy had the nerve to give her a $2 credit for being given raw shrimp. It's like she thought we were trying to get free food. Well  the food was awful on one plate; and the other plate had food on it that was raw (which was shown to her). How much proof do that idiots need? We'll never go there again!

Totally caught off guard by the rudest customer service I have EVER experienced, I went back to the manager and said a mop was needed. She then informed me they don't have mops. After I told her how appalled I was that she was making us clean it up ourselves, she informed me that they didn't get paid enough to do that, but would see if someone could clean it. The manager returned to the table apologizing and offered to give us a free dessert.  Are you serious!!!!!  A free dessert!!!!

I order the app trio ( with burger bites, cheese bites, and original Chicken crispers) the chicken was under cooked to the point the breading on the inside was wet and the chicken was rubbery and slightly pink I ate my other food and waited for my server then showed him the problem he apologized and offered to bring me another app or redo this app i said that fine i love the chicken normally so he took my plate with the chicken pieces i had cut in half and the breading falling off and raw and returned just 3 minutes later with the same plate i kid you not the cook put that chicken back in the fryer.... this time it was overcooked and hard as a rock and ummmmm gross who does that. so when asked if that was better i said no its worse he offered again i politely declined and said i was done. He offered a discount on my meal which i didn't ask for and it was appreciated! so again my server was not the problem the cook was. Not to mention the floors were disgusting and in general the restaurant was not as clean as i am used to!

Service at the bar was friendly but a little slow- he was swamped at the service well. Definitely a staffing problem and not the bartenders fault. People waiting for a table were also trying to get drinks so it was a little hectic but the bartender kept a kind demeanor- even with some rude customers at the end of the bar. Food was not good. My order had to be sent back 3 times and by then the veggie burger was smashed to pieces, the fries were cold and requested avocado was missing. The bartender asked a server to fetch it from the kitchen and he brought out my 3 slices of avocado *on a dirty plate* all the while reminding the bartender he needed to ring it up (which he already had). There needs to be a proper expo to make sure this food is going out correct and on time. Prebusing was also non-existent. Closing people's tabs out when their dirty dishes are in front of them is a no no. Even at Chili's. My fiancé waited on my food to come out to start eating so his was cold too by the time we got tired of trying to get what I asked for.  No apology from management- no attempts to make it right. I don't expect freebies but if you mess up more than once at least drop by and say sorry.  To add insult to injury we ordered two rounds of beer during happy hour only to not have the second round rung up on time - considering the non-happy hour price was only $.89 more we were more upset about the fact that the happy hour price was basically a lie.  No paper towels in the restroom, sticky floor, water all over the counters, trash on the floor, and the straight open view to the kitchen- servers handling Tortilla chips with their bare hands. Cooks with no gloves handling dishes and wiping their hands on a rag instead of washing them in a sink.

Unfortunately what reminded me to check in wasn't a pleasant reminder. A few people I went with got there prior to me and I went ahead and asked them to order for me. I specifically told them what I wanted to eat for lunch. And what I wanted as my beverage. I had them order me a sweet peach tea. As soon as I get to the table and take a sip of my drink. To my surprise it was unsweetened. I asked my colleagues if it was a joke and they said no, we got unsweetened tea as well even tho we asked for sweet. I got there and did not see the waitress for the longest time. When I did end up seeing her it was because she was bringing out the food. Once again. When my food was brought out the order was wrong. Well my friend did mention that she ordered it correctly, but they brought it out incorrectly. So I told the waitress and she looks at my friend with a dumb founded look and was like ugh fine I'll get the fried pickles. Well since i was on a time frame for work I started eating. The rest of the experience does not get any better. I did not see the waitress until I had already finished my meal. The fried pickles did not come out until I was done with the rest of my meal ( by this time I was full) and we never got napkins and refills until the end. I would completely understand if it was busy, but the waitress only had 3 tables tops and spent most of her time in the back.

Food came and one order was wrong so he had to take it back and fix it. My Water was not refilled at all during our time there and the service in general was very slow and lacking. We asked him to split the check and he asked how so we said 50/50-down the middle. He brought the check back with an uneven amount and then a check for my 8 year old daughter so three checks that weren't even split 50/50. We asked him to fix it and again explained 50/50 for the check. It took several minutes and he brought back two checks and they still weren't split 50/50. We did not take time to try again.
