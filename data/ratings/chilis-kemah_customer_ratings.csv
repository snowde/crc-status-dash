This Kemah location allows smoking in their bar, so I got the added bonus of smelling like an ashtray with my meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kemah?start=20,1.9960000000000002,1.9960000000000002,1.9960000000000002,1.9960000000000002,1.9960000000000002
23,Troy K.,"Kemah, TX",335,352,1113.0,3.0,2012-06-10,Well it is a Chili's so you know what you are getting food wise. This Chili's is one of the best ones I have been to. The staff is really friendly and top notch. Happy Hour in the bar is pretty much all the time and the bartenders are great. If you go often you will see a lot of the same folks in the bar so it has a nice Cheers kind of vibe. Yes they do allow smoking in the bar but I have rarely had too many smokers in there.  Happy hour in the bar gets you free chips and salsa if you ask and I have to say these are some great chips and salsa. Really they are better than many mexican places I visit.  My go to meal here is to split a Triple dipper with my wife. Great value and plenty of food for 2.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kemah?start=20,1.9960000000000002,1.9960000000000002,1.9960000000000002,1.9960000000000002,1.9960000000000002

39,David G.,"League City, TX",0,3,1.0,1.0,2014-01-01,"The food and drinks at the restaurant is excellent, but they recently made a policy change which has been infuriating.  The restaurant used to serve ""Happy Hour"" specials throughout the entire restaurant.  They now only serve those specials in the bar.  The bar is always constantly filled with smoke - so much so that I ask to sit as far away as possible.  Even though it's segregated by a wall, the smoke lingers far into the non-smoking section.  I am allergic to cigarette smoke.  Since I can't go into the bar, I can't get the specials.  This new policy is very descriminating against non smokers and those like me who may have allergies. I know there are others out there who feel the same way.  This restaurant will get no more of my business until they stop this discrimination by either opening the specials up to the whole restaurant or making the bar smoke free.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kemah?start=20,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002

I went there this evening, told the host table for 1 he asked me if I'd like sit in bar area. I saw there was a football game on so I said yes. I sat for quit some time but no one came over, I went back to host & told him,he said he'd grab a waiter, I told him it was to smoky anyway so I'd sit in normal seat. I guess there wasn't enough servers cause it took forever then the girl that helped me wasn't even my waitress. I ordered my steak rare & it was over cooked.

37,C D.,"League City, TX",0,12,1.0,1.0,2014-09-15,"What a terrible experience! I think that Chilis is using their ""convenient table kiosks"" as a replacement for staff and customer service. They need to hire more staff instead of relying on one or two people to service a restaurant -- where is management?Too bad the table kiosk can't refill my drink (after all, I would like more than one glass with an entire meal,) or clear the numerous plates off my table so that I don't have to shuffle app plates and dinner plates while I try to eat my lukewarm dinner.

After going to see the fireworks in Kemah we went to Chili's, the worst mistake ever!!!!! We could tell the server wasn't happy we came in and sat at his table,no greeting, no hello....it was more like""what can I get ya to drink"" He didn't even give us his name, I ordered a margarita, it was the kind in a shaker, I thought he was supposed to pour it for me, NOPE I was wrong! He pretty much slammed it down and walked away!!! We ordered our food, I got a guacamole burger with roasted jalapeños grilled onions and peppers , well what I got was a burger with a small spoonful of guacamole with a few little red specks of red pepper, no roasted jalapeños, no onions, nothing!!! Now the roasted jalapeños, that's the reason I ordered the burger to begin with, they are my favorite!!! When I brought this to my servers attention, he said oh ok I'll fix it, as he walked away rolling his eyes!  He brought me back the same burger with a side of pickled jalapeños!!! WHAT?????? Pickled is a far cry from roasted!!!! Needless to say I didn't eat dinner!! Thanks for nothing!!!!

21,Carmela S.,"New Orleans, LA",823,1039,3471.0,2.0,2015-07-20,"I stopped here on my way home from a weekend trip to meet my family for lunch!  It wasn't super busy when we first got there but, the parking can be a little tight in the lot.  They initially had us in a booth that was going to be way too tight for 6 adults and a baby so, we waited while they pushed together some other tables. They have little ""tablet"" type consoles on the table that you can purchase and play games on or pay your bill on with a card.  Personally I think that just gives people more of a reason to go out together and ignore each other; like most people do on their phones. The service took forever and we were there for a good two hours.  Obviously we picked a chain place because it would be quicker and I still had a 3.5 hour drive back to Austin.  It took a long time to get our drinks, our appetizers came out quickly but not complete and our food took over 40 minutes after the appetizers.  Either our server was overwhelmed or he was just not good at multitasking.  We had to ask for refills and sat without refills for a while before we saw him again to ask. The food:  I mean it's chili's and it's a chain so, I didn't have big expectations at all because most of their stuff comes in pre-made, frozen and definitely not made in house.  The Southwestern egg rolls were actually decent as well as the dipping sauce.  We decided to try their new White queso with spinach and I wouldn't recommend it.  They dropped it off without the chips so, it got cold by the time our chips came.  Then It was like just melted cheese that I actually had to cut with a fork, with some creamy queso underneath (not a lot) and it had some pico, onions and guacamole on top.  Also, the chips were super greasy.  For my main meal I had the Fresh Mex Bowl with shrimp in it.  I would say it was  stars.  It was supposed to be spicy but, I had to ask for some more sauce and he brought me a chipolte sauce which worked well but, the lettuce with the rice and all the other flavors just didn't blend well.  The shrimp were way over done and this made them chewy; also, they were flavorless! After all this we waited for another 15 minutes before our server came back to get the card to pay the bill and bring our togo chicken fingers that my great aunt ordered. I can't say I am too surprised because you know what you are getting when you come to a chain like this but, I was hoping to be surprised!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kemah?start=20,,,,,

29,Tonys M.,"Houston, TX",4,10,3.0,2.0,2016-03-25,"The last two times I have been to this Chili's I have had the same problem: some type of ""hot"" sauce is added to the food. The first time it was the salad had some sauce added to it that I specifically asked not be on the salad. Have you tried to eat a hot, spicy salad? The server took it back, but it seemed all that was done was the top lettuce scraped off and the ""hot sauce"" was left at the bottom of the plate. Tonight I ordered chicken fajitas and it came with some hot ""chipotle butter"" drizzled over the meat and grilled onions. I asked why it had the sauce on it and was told it has always come with that. I don't like hot, spicy sauce and I have never had this ""chipotle butter"" on my fajitas before. I complained to the manager and they made the chicken again, but it was just a piece of grilled chicken without much flavor. They have hot sauce and spice on everything. This is a real deal breaker for me because I don't like spicy.....The waiter was helpful, but it took over 10 minutes before he was told that we were his table. Don't know if we will return to Chili's after two bad experiences in a row. We have been going to Chili's since the original opened on Greenville Ave. in Dallas back in the day.
