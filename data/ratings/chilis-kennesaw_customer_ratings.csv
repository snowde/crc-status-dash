32,Jade M.,"Atlanta, GA",37,45,35.0,4.0,2012-01-28,"There's something about the ice at this place. Same as Zaxby's and The Varsity. Makes the drink taste so good!  The staff is always very friendly and courteous. We recently visited with a friends little boy and he was a little loud at times but they were just as friendly and helpful as they could be. Great service, they are always working hard and manager does a great job of checking on tables and getting anything you need, sometimes without asking. The margaritas are great! Love the quesadilla explosion salad. The bottomless chips and dip are a must! Sorry if I'm helping ""competition"" of Yelp here but if you check-in on FourSquare you get free chips and dip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kennesaw?start=20,2.7039999999999997,2.7039999999999997,2.7039999999999997,2.7039999999999997,2.7039999999999997

31,Christen M.,"Marietta, GA",0,11,1.0,1.0,2014-08-04,"I decided to write a review after having my 2nd awful experience. I have been in the service industry for years, so I am the first person to forgive a server who is overwhelmed or food that takes longer than usual to arrive. However, poor attitudes are inexcusable and can't make up for the other things. Twice in a row, we've had one server talking negatively about us right beside our table. Obviously not smart enough to realize that the noisy restaurant wasn't enough to drown her out. Either the manager didn't care or she simply wasn't surprised, because when I told her what we had experienced, she simply said she apologized and would speak to her. The past time we've gone, the waitress never once said you're welcome when we said thank you, didn't bother to check on us and take our entree order until our appetizers sat empty for a few minutes, leading to a 2 hour lunch on a Thursday. As I've stated previously, I'm the first person to forgive and excuse a waitperson, but Chilis, please focus more on either keeping your staff happy or different ways to deal with bad attitudes. A group of teenagers can try your patience, but when I had to witness this waitress being short and rude to my own father, it was too much to handle. The manager came by, I told him how our experience was going and he simply apologized. No offer for a complimentary dessert or even to take care of our appetizer? Extremely disappointed in these last two visits and I will be looking forward to having my many lunches and dinners out at other places along Barrett Parkway. There are way too many places to dine, where our patronage is appreciated to have to deal with such bad customer service. Very sorry to have to write this review, but maybe this will give a little bit of a wake up call to the managers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kennesaw?start=20,1.8600000000000003,1.8600000000000003,1.8600000000000003,1.8600000000000003,1.8600000000000005

I'm not a big fan of Chili's restaurant, but they hey have completely changed their menu since the last time I visited a Chili's restaurant.  Here on a lunch date a little after noon, I ordered the fajita's, and they were really good. Our server was so the coolest bartender I have met in a while. He was very attentive, very social, taught us how to use the electronic order system and also how to play games with it, he even encouraged us to go on social media and post pictures lol - hilarious.

Since I was short on time and already feeling full, I told him not to worry about them.  I didn't need replacement slices. However, no more than two minutes later, a manager approached with a dish of replacement avocado slices.  He apologized for the unripe ones and waited for me to let him know if the new ones were acceptable. All in all, not what I expected from a Chili's. I did find the fries to be lacking and with an odd lingering aroma.  Must be the seasoning they add? The chicken in the sandwich was bland and totally lacking seasoning. The beef chili with shredded cheese was a pale imitation of canned Hormel chili if I had to guess. So, the food - not so much a draw.  But, the service is a winner.  I still have money on the holiday gift card.  When I return, I'll order something else and see how that turns out.  =)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kennesaw,,,,,

4,Tara B.,"Atlanta, GA",27,78,282.0,1.0,2017-03-30,"Their service is Complete Garbage!!  It's not often that I give less than 3 stars, but this place is horrible. Party of 8 on a Saturday evening, no reservations, so you expect wait time. My family and I left Cracker Barrel and chose this place instead. Mistake.  They said 35 minute wait so after 50 minutes one of my aunts went to walk around to look at availability. Spoke to a manager. We were told that we could be seated at two tables next to each other but they couldn't be pulled together. At first I though it wasn't possible bc of the way the tables were seated, so I was like whatever. BTW, we were told the tables were ready and the hostess simply pointed in the general vicinity of the tables, didn't walk us to them.... didn't understand why the tables weren't able to be pulled together when we guessed which tables they were.  Regardless of the mishaps thus far, we were determined to enjoy each other. Our waiter was good in the beginning. 45 minutes had passed and we still have no food. Other patrons have arrived, finished their food and left restaurant and still no food. Mind you, because the wait was so long we all knew exactly what to order before we were seated so our orders were placed immediately. We asked our waiter if he could check on an eta for the food. With an attitude he snaps, it's a large party so it's going to take longer. We say nothing in response to the unwarranted attitude because the food hasn't come out and we're not chancing you taking it out on our food.  So we continue waiting...no update. Food gets there. Two of the plates were cold and sent back. Chicken tenders weren't even room temperature, they were cold. My mom's meal didn't even come out until several minutes after everybody else because they forgot it. When we asked for simple items like napkins and condiments, we had to ask multiple times. The 3rd time asking, I was given more attitude. I had a burger and needed mayo to begin eating it so at this point, I matched his attitude. Bro, we've been at the restaurant for almost two hours at this point, I'm hungry, your service has dropped below subpar and my patience for you is nonexistent at this point.  Let's just say that someone else ended up serving us for a while because the original server was ""missing"" for a while.  Meanwhile, the two tables next to us were pulled together for a party the same size as us. *side eyes and blank stares* Why wasn't this offer extended to us. We're all paying customers!! The manager was called to hear about our whole experience and how it's totally unacceptable.  I WILL NEVER VISIT THIS ESTABLISHMENT AGAIN. I'll also let my friends, family and associates know about the experience so they can take their business elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kennesaw,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
9,Robert C.,"Decatur, GA",6,47,,2.0,2017-05-29,"My Mom wanted to try this Chili's since she likes their baby back ribs. She ordered them and enjoyed them, but that's about all I can say that's good about this place. My Mom is 91. And whatever she wants, she gets. :) I ordered a salad with grilled salmon. It was OK. The salmon was over-cooked and the dressing was very blah. The real downer of this place is the management and staff. Everyone is very nice, but it is very disorganized and poorly run. It was ironic that we were told the wait staff works on a buddy system so two people can tag-team to improve our experience. I think each one thought the other one was servicing us since we got no one. It was by far the worst service I have received in years. I had to get up and walk to find someone to help us several times. The dessert took so long we just cancelled it. On top of that, and I know this sounds awful, but the personal hygiene of several of the wait staff was just horrible; they had body oder and appeared unbathed. Not something you want at a restaurant. And the tables were sticky, and went uncleared for a long time. So you sit next to a table with a ton of dirty dishes. I think the next time my Mom wants their baby back ribs, I'll just get them 'to go' so I don't have to sit in this place and be ignored.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kennesaw,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64

The food arrived and the chicken crisper were really bad. So greasy it was sitting in a small pool of grease. One of the chicken fingers was really off- gray and rubbery. The cilantro vinaigrette is gross. The side salad was literally mixed greens with light cheese and nothing else. The corn had weird bits of cheese stuck to it and was cold.
