28,Joseph P.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",30,471,1434.0,2.0,2012-01-22,"Saturday night and nearly dead at 9pm.  Not a good sign. Came here for an after-movie dinner and came away wishing I'd gone somewhere else, as they have slipped from past performance.  Started with the Southwest Egg Rolls - 3 ""tubes"", each sliced in half, for $9.  Ok, but not worth it.  The Spicy Chicken Wrap was pretty good.  The Buffalo Chicken Ranch sandwich was not - a dry, hard coated chicken patty deep fried, with a little ranch dressing & hot sauce dabbed on top, on a bun.  Both come with plain fries - fresh, but nothing special. Service was friendly, but sloppy - server spent too much time gabbing with the bartender across the room, and didn't deliver the hot sauce requested nor refill drinks in a reasonable time. All around us, others were loudly cleaning up the place as if getting ready to close - at 9:30?   The new wireless ""Video Toys"" on the table are novel, but have limited use - they are mostly electronic menu suggestions and a pay-for-play game machine. You can pay your bill on them - they default to suggesting a 20% tip if you let them.  They take up too much space for what they add.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kildeer?start=40,1.8,1.8,1.8,1.8,1.8000000000000003

36,Rob W.,"Oak Park, IL",194,819,11.0,3.0,2012-08-11,"I'm not a big fan of Chili's or large chain restaurants in general for that matter. But I was meeting a friend with two small children and frankly, this place is one of the better options for kids in the area.  I ordered a cheeseburger that came with fries - it was pretty average. The kids had chicken fingers that came with mandarin orange slices - great idea and both the kids finished the fruit. My friend had salmon which must've been OK as she finished it - with a little help from her kids. I wish I could recall the server's name because she really was attentive and deserves a mention - especially since many of the previous Yelpers had a bad service experience. Our server was attentive and stopped by the table often to see if she could get us anything. Kudos to her! Because of her service, I'd almost rate my experience there at a four star level, but Chili's is Chili's - I can't bring myself to do it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kildeer?start=20,1.9320000000000002,1.9320000000000002,1.9320000000000002,1.9320000000000002,1.9320000000000004

However, this visit was far under par. I've had several visits to this particular Chili's location that fit in this category, unfortunately. The water is funky, the servers are rather unengaged, and the food is handled poorly. I had the shrimp tacos, which I LOVE at every other Chili's, but these were wrapped in stale tortillas, and extremely-over-ripe-borderline-rotten avocadoes.

51,Valerie D.,"Deerfield, IL",447,613,101.0,3.0,2012-10-03,"Before my recent visit, it had been YEARS since I had stepped foot into a Chili's.  Probably at least two.  And probably two before that. Chili's was the place I frequented in college, because, let's face it, when you had to get out of the dorms for a ""real meal,"" Steak and Shake didn't cut it, and Alexander's Steakhouse was out of the ramen noodle budget. But... I'm not in college anymore.  So, I like to frequent independent places when I can, instead of chains. At any rate, we went to the movies on Sunday and wanted to grab a quick bite to eat afterward.  My BF wasn't very hungry, and neither of us wanted to break the bank.  He remembered that they had cheap drink specials.  Win. We sat in the bar area at a booth.  Our server was prompt, and brought drinks quickly.  We ordered two appetizers to share: Texas Cheese Fries: the cheese wasn't very melty, and there were many fries underneath that didn't have any cheesy goodness. Triple Dipper with chicken crispers, big mouth bites, and southwestern eggrolls.  I always remember the breading on the chicken crispers being really thick, but the chicken underneath (which i pulled the breading away from all together, was tender and juicy.  The wrapper on the eggrolls seemed pretty thick too, and a little chewy.  I didn't try to big mouth bites. My BF thought everything was delicious.  Of course. What I REALLY wanted, was the southern smokehouse bbq bacon burger, but... my diet said no, you can still make a more responsible choice.

We sat in the bar area and there was only 1 other table. The menus were beyond disgusting! They were caked with so much food and something sticky that the pages were getting stuck together. Drinks were delivered promptly but when our pretzel sticks came to the table I was extremely disappointed. The cheese looked as if it had been sitting under the heat lamp for a while on top of the fact that the ramekin was only half full. (Luckily they were free since I'm a member of their email club.) Our server never returned to take our order until we were practically done with the app. When a server returned, not our server because he was ""too busy"" since he had 1 other table, she took our order for him. When I asked about the cheese I was told that's how it always is and that its one of the things she really dislikes on their menu. Dinner took awhile to arrive and it was just ok to say the least!!! The fact that the best part of our meal was the carmelized onions on my fajitas is embarrassing!!! During our visit a single man was also sat at a high table in the bar area. I watched him get up and go to the server station to get something to clean his table because it was never wiped down. He then asked one of the servers to clean it for him. He did not look happy!!! I will return to chili's but never to this location!! There are so many other places in deer park to dine and I'm sorry that we chose chili's!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kildeer?start=40,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001

44,Lefai K.,"Chicago, IL",282,636,421.0,2.0,2013-06-30,"I remember going to Chili's to be a treat. This was probably because I grew up in the city and there were no any. We would go to Lincolnwood Town Center and go there when we were in highschool. I remember it was the first place I experienced a chicken quesadilla and I thought it was fine dine cuisine.   Fast forward to 15-years later and living in the burbs where I'm constantly bombarded with suburban mainstays like Applebees, Chilis and Olive Gardens. Now I remember why I don't come here much anymore. This place reminds me of Chicago weather -- if you don't like it, wait a few minutes and it'll change. The waiter informed us that their menu changes every 6-months. It's interesting that they have this policy as the menu was 10-pages long and it seemed like there was at least 100 items offered. It was almost like the Walmart of restaurants, except the prices weren't walmart prices.   I opted for the $8 lunch special which came with a soap and lunch. The soup I got was the Spicy Southwest Chicken & Sausage Soup. It should have been called the Spicy Salt & Salt soup. I think the chef must have dumped a whole bag of salt in it... it was barely edible. We also ordered the Chipotle chicken Margarita flatbreads and it was burnt, the chicken was barely there, and the tomatoes where barely there. Not so good either. The chicken fajitas were decent. BATHROOM REVIEW: The bathroom was somewhat clean, but it smelled like a  giant urinal cake. What was interesting was that the paper towel dispenser was right next to the sink, while the soap dispenser was further away. Meh, I guess its not complicated, but I dont like to think when I'm peeing. Its my Zen time and I like to be at peace. Sit or squat?

40,Rohit S.,"Chicago, IL",24,27,,1.0,2016-02-09,Service was poor. I asked for a glass of water which I received almost at the end of my stay. My wife ordered burger medium well and they served it well done. My food was cold and it was supposed to be served sizzling hot. The server checked very less on us. What a waste of time and money.

19,Jeana B.,"Barrington, IL",0,11,,2.0,2016-05-12,"Today we decided to go Chili's for lunch. We had not been there for a year or two. We were seated promptly by a girl who said she would be waiting on us. We placed drink orders and received them in a good amount of time then placed our lunch orders. We both ordered lunch combos, I got the chipotle fresh mex bowl and my husband ordered the double burger & fries. They both came with soup which took the server 15 minutes to bring to us and the soup was barely warm. After eating our soup and finishing our drinks it took our server a very long time to come back and ask if we wanted drink refills. Finally we received our drink refills then asked about our food order as it had been 40 minutes since we ordered, I mean it's only a burger and a chicken bowl. She said something about the kitchen and walked off and after waiting some more we finally got our lunch with a half hearted ""sorry for the wait"". Again none of the food was hot just barely warm. My husbands burger was dry & well done and the chicken in my mex bowl was rubbery like it was microwaved. I should also mention that they were not busy while we were there but rather empty. Now we remembered why we haven't gone to Chili's, slow sub-par service and unsatisfactory food. Not again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kildeer,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92
8,Gina D.,"Palatine, IL",135,187,253.0,3.0,2016-06-09,"Decent.  I enjoyed the food but maybe overall average. The waitress go better as we ate, but started off rocky. We had the warm spinach Queso with chips and salsa. The shrimp/steak fatitjas and the cajuin chicken pasta. I got the tito punch cocktail and my mom ordered the blueberry margetrita.  I thought overall delicious and okay service. I'm surprised with everyone's bad ratings but it's also not the greatest.

18,Amber R.,"Chicago, IL",25,6,,1.0,2016-08-07,"When my family and I first walked in the host sat the five of us at a four-top table even though the restaurant was pretty much empty. Our waitress was nice but she couldn't even remember our drink order.. that she wrote down... She messed it up twice. I don't mean to throw her under the bus but we saw her messing around with the staff more than actually making sure her customers were happy and taken care of. When we finished our chips and queso we pushed our empty soda mugs to the end of the table for her to take and she walked past our table at least 3 times without even glancing at it and so did several other waiters as well as the host. No one brought shells out for my fajitas and we had to ask twice for a side of sour cream. The fajitas normally come out sizzling hot, but this time they came out luke warm and limp. When the food runner brought out our meal we were confused by the two different plates of quesadillas we ordered. When we asked him which ones were which he looked like a physical deer in headlights. We had to look at a menu to figure out which ones were which. We sat for about 5-8 minutes waiting for our check while our waitress walked back and forth past our table filled with 5 empty mugs and empty plates stacked high even though the restaurant was nearly empty. My family and I are always kind guests and we're very laid back about service but this experience was just a clusterf***. If a manager was anywhere in the restaurant it didn't show because all of the staff was just standing around. I guess it's our fault for going to a two-star rated Yelp restaurant but like I said, we usually aren't very picky.  We stuck it out but the disappointment was real.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kildeer,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0
9,Heidi M.,"Lake Zurich, IL",6,12,,1.0,2016-10-02,Every time we order from here they screw it up.  This time they didnt give us tortillas with our fajitas.  I ordered mine without onions and they added at least a full onion.  I wish we could get fajitas somewhere else but the meat is good (when they put the correct amount in the order),https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kildeer,1.88,1.88,1.88,,1.88
10,Danny G.,"Buffalo Grove, IL",0,2,,1.0,2016-10-05,Do not come to this location they give very poor service. My buddy and I stepped away from the table for a few minutes and came back to a table that was half bused with other people's dishes on the table. They filled our beer halfway and said we should be happy with it. Not to mention the bartender practically threw the check at my friend. When we spoke to the manager she didn't care.

7,Don G.,"Lake Zurich, IL",0,9,,1.0,2016-12-26,"Very deceptive, just to get us in the door. Called ahead to get an estimate of how long the wait for a table would be (they do not take reservations here).  They told us that there is no wait for a table.  Drive over there with the family and upon arrival, am told the wait would be over an hour.  I get that the wait time is an estimate and the situation changes, but an hour? Of course I proceed to tease my wife for calling the wrong restaurant.  So, she pulls out here phone, calls the restaurant to ask how long for a table, and is once again told no wait!!!!!!! She confirms that she called the restaurant we are standing in waiting for a table.  She informs the person on the phone that we are at the restaurant waiting for a table.  The person on the phone had no shame whatsoever. With honesty like that, we then left and decided to wait for a table elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kildeer,1.88,1.88,1.88,,1.88
5,Leslie J.,"Lake Zurich, IL",60,76,12.0,2.0,2017-01-23,"Ok, it Chilis, it's not the Ritz, I get it. But, it's a restaurant that has been around for a long time and under the circumstances I don't think it will be around much longer, this location anyway. To begin with, service was aweful! We were there ( 10 of us) at 6pm on a Sunday night, the place was DEAD! Why is a CHILIS dead at 6pm on a Sunday night?  You giys are going to have a very hard time getting the locals to come back when you have so much competition surrounding you. So, I'm going to make this fast/ easy. Ordered pink lemonade,  brought it to the table looked funny, wad told sorry the machine is broken. Never got more iced tea, was told sorry the machine is broken. Ordered a mushroom Swiss burger, brought cheddar, was told sorry, no cheddar oh and sorry, no mushrooms. Sent back 2 burgers TWICE not cooked properly. Oh, they also forgot to serve my moms salad after they delivered it wrong the first time. Water machine must have been broken too because we never got more. I DO NOT blame the server, I blame her lack of training,  that is not on her. I did speak to the manager Jaime and she was GREAT,  Chilis better get their act together because she can go anywhere,  she was that good. She was sent there 2 weeks ago to figure out why this location is such a disaster.  ( my words, not hers) I would have given 1 star but because of her I gave 2.

Just heard someone in the kitchen say loudly ""he's half black, so it's fine!"" and then laughter. I'm sitting here in stunned silence and trying to figure out if I want to keep eating or just take my food to go.  My dinner companion just came back from the bathroom and said 'I changed my mind about going to the bathroom', I asked why. He said 'well, it smells like sewer....'  So even though we've come in the past (we are never sure why...), I'm not sure we'll come back to this location. Whatever the comment in the kitchen meant, or was intended to be, it was said loudly by tables, and it feels incredibly inappropriate... I'm actively uncomfortable, and so annoyed that I'm sitting here at my table and writing this in an obvious way.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kildeer,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0

We sat there and watched staff walk right by. We saw an empty booth and sat ourselves. We sat and waited again. I finally asked a server for drinks and she proceeded to say ""your server will be right there"" this after waiting for 15 min in our booth.

We placed our order at least 15 minutes ago and are still waiting for our food. after delivering our drinks I had to go out and get straws and now after getting our food finally delivered,my husband had to go and grab silverware himself, so the service is sub par.They get one star for being friendly and comping is chips and salsa.
