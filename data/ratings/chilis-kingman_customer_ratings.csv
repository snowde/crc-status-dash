42,Don H.,"Henderson, NV",25,18,9.0,4.0,2012-09-13,"Came in late around 9 PM and they were to close at 10.   Service was pleasant... ordered a Chili and Salad combo.... didn't want to eat to heavy so late.  The Chili had a wierd burnt taste,  the salad w Ranch was good... dressing had a nice flavor.... salad was fresh.   To make is a 5 stars,  I would have preferred a very delicious Chile.    After all the name of the restaurant is Chili's......  Anyway,  there were lots of TVs on and if was a nice atmosphere, prices were not too bad..... so overall, a pretty nice place that late when most places in town are already closing down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kingman?start=20,1.968,1.968,1.968,1.968,1.968

The food was good. We did the 2 for $20 dinner deal. We shared the onion and jalapeno strings as an app. Im not usually a fan of jalapeno anything, but they were very tasty. She had a burger and i had the chicken fajitas. My chicken kind of tasted like the ""smoke"" on it was from a cigarette rather than a grill, but Ive noticed that at other Chilis locations as well.

21,Stephanie A.,"Costa Mesa, CA",1,53,14.0,1.0,2015-01-02,"Horrible experience at this restaurant! Horrible service, management and mediocre food. My husband and I were driving through on a very long trip from Co to Ca and stopped at Chilis bc we had a gift certificate. We sat in the bar and was initially served by the extremely rude bartender named Dustin. My husband asked for an ice tea and 2 apps. I was in the bathroom when he ordered these but we I came back we were greeted by another nice bartender who asked if we wanted anything. I told him my husband had already ordered. Then Dustin turns around and says ""oh ya, they had..."" And just then puts in the order. Then my husband gets back from the bathroom and asks where his ice tea was so we ask the new bartender for one.  Then Dustin turns around and says ""your iced tea I coming okay just hold on"" ... Keep in mind it's been 15 mins now. So Dustin sets down the iced tea and says ""here you go turbo"" to my husband and my husband says "" Ya thanks tough guy"" Then Dustin goes to the end of the bar and starts talking about us to the other customers that were sitting at the end of the bar and I hear him tell them that's he's staying away from our side of the bar. Which means he literally would pour beers in front of us and see that we could use a refill and would do nothing. The other bartender that ended up helping us was very nice but unfortunately the other idiot ruined our dinner. Also, worst guacamole I've ever tasted- running and watered down.  My husband called to complain to the manager Sonja, and she was clueless and said she's never gotten a complaint before. Haha! Look at yelp! She replied that she's not familiar with yelp. Unbelievable. There's an In and Out right down the street from this place....

There was a female waitress, I couldn't remember her name (she had dark hair and was super skinny), but she literally could win the ""resting b**** face of the year"" award. When we were being led to our table to be seated, I walked by her, nodded and smiled saying hello (as any other human being would) and she had THE WORST stank face I have ever seen in my life... she didn't even say anything to me either. Honestly after that, I knew the whole experience was going to be crap. I mean her stank face was literally so impressive that she probably could be featured on one of Drake's music videos or something. I wish I could have taken a picture of it just to frame it and make money off of it because it was just that impressive. (claps hands) You go girl. The silverware and napkins never made it to the table until we had to find some random employee to give us some...half an hour after being seated and after we had already started on our chips and salsa. Yes thats right folks, the appetizers and drinks came to our table before we even had any silverware or napkins.  If it was busy then I would definitely understand why the service could have been lacking, but it was almost completely empty in there so no excuses bruh.

The food, steak and chix fajitas, huge pile of sizzling onions with 5 pieces of steak the size of the first two knuckles of my pinky finger,..... a few more pieces of chicken. (they up charge for the steak btw). The entree was tasty, good flavor and fresh tasting ingredients. Lava cake for desert, tasted like it had been stored for a long time in the freezer.

I literally received a fraud warning text from my credit card co. about a 30+% tip I left at gas lamp flemmings just a day ago) Additionally, this meal was expensed to my employer, I ground my teeth leaving 14% of their money.

Having said that, I will say I see massive improvements to this location as far as service and quality...  I was immediately greeted with a very smiley and happy server ( Melissa) . My food came out hot and in a timely manner. I will be returning to this location soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kingman,2.2,2.2,2.2,,2.2
5,Annetta S.,"Kingman, AZ",51,1,,1.0,2017-10-10,So had the worst experience and probably not going back we ordered appetizer it came out wrong then we ordered a  salad with shrimp the bartender yelled acrossed the bar that i could not have shrimp with no season and when i asked why the manager walked over and quietly said because the shrimp is frozen. Then i explained i could not have the spice and he walked away and didnt say anything. We also ordered fajita with no onions and peppers then it came out with onions and pappers and when we asked what this was he said fajitas when we repeated what we ordered it took a deep breath and took it away he helped other people at the bar them came back and said sobyou want fajjitas and this point i was upset from the rudeness that i said no just forget it. Noone came to see if we were wanting anything else until after we were ready to leave. I went to checkout i had to call the mgr back over because the over charge for my drink and double charge me for the fries and never took my salad off. He then starting to ask if this service was good here today and i said his bartender is always nice but service saw the worst ever and that he was not good at all. Then he looked at my husband and says i seem to know you and he said we are in here 4 or 5 times a month but not coming back. It is hard to believe how bad the service was.  Most likely not goung back,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kingman,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16

0,Lauri B.,"Bullhead City, AZ",0,21,,5.0,2017-10-25,Stopped in for lunch with a friend.  Service was prompt and courteous.  Had guacamole burger which was done to perfection.  The cilantro and jalapeno was just the right amount to give it a zip without taking away from the taste of the burger.  We also had the chicken tacos which were excellent.  One thing I noticed was that the dill pickles are served on the side and are sprinkled with a little dill.  Really brought out the flavor of the pickles! Good place for lunch.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kingman,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
