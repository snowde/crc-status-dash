20,Jen M.,"Hinsdale, IL",58,246,32.0,5.0,2012-01-20,"My parents live in Kingsville and this is their go-to restaurant. The ones up north where I live are not as good. The menu has lots of options, the portions are generous, and the food is simple, but tasty. Great comfort and classic foods.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kingsville-2?start=20,,,,,
15,Skye T.,"Sugar Land, TX",2,29,1.0,3.0,2013-01-16,Just like any chili's. The service here is hit or miss sometimes you get great service and sometimes you get no service and wait an hour to get your food. Also don't drink the water.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kingsville-2,,,,,
23,David D.,"San Antonio, TX",0,9,,3.0,2013-04-05,"Passing thru town and wanted dinner for mom, dad, 3 kids, and grandma. Yelped and Chilis won.  Hostess was terrific. Space was clean to include restrooms. I stole some of my 5 year old's chicken nuggets because the batter and moistness was awesome. 3 more salads were great entrees.  So why three stars? An example of poor service ruining the experience. Keveon (yes, correct spelling) was a poor waiter. Sides were missing, extras requested and forgotten, and slow to bring check and doggie boxes. The finale was my ""declined"" credit card. Stunned and embarrassed, I paid in cash and quickly got on the road and on the phone with my credit card bank. They quickly accounted for my gas purchase up the road, and no theft on the account. She said that the restaurant probably had a connection problem then confirmed it with the code on my receipt that said ""DECLINED: could not make SSL c"". I expect a waiter to know the transaction codes.   So, great experience, ruined by the waiter. If your the manager reading this, retrain him or let him go. Preserve your restaurant's otherwise good reputation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kingsville-2?start=20,,,,,
16,James F.,"San Antonio, TX",38,193,31.0,3.0,2013-08-25,"We make this a regular place for dinner when visiting Kingsville.  This weekend service was VERY slow.  We waited 15 minutes before our drinks/starter order were taken.  After our waitress finally arrived food was served quickly, and she kept our drinks filled.  Meals were usual Chili's affair, nothing special here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kingsville-2,,,,,
14,Jose M.,"Brownsville, TX",0,21,,1.0,2013-11-28,This place is the worst possible choice you can make.  Eat here and you will wish you had stopped and eaten the bugs out of your grill.  I have tried twice and both times the service was very bad.  Drive on past.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kingsville-2,,,,,
18,John L.,"Fairfield, TX",0,4,,2.0,2014-08-17,"Waitressing in the bar was horrible. Took forever to get our tea. We asked to change one of the TVs and it seemed like it was a chore for them. I've been many times before to this location, it's a 50 50 chance of good service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kingsville-2,,,,,
13,Andrew W.,"Kingsville, TX",93,11,1.0,3.0,2014-09-01,This location features typical Chili's fare. The service is okay but don't be surprised if you have to ask several times for a refill and you're probably going to wait longer than average for your ticket. The kiosks at each table are useless for splitting tickets unless you want them split evenly.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kingsville-2,,,,,
19,Bill G.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,5,,2.0,2014-10-17,Usually get it to go and you would think that I would have learned by now.  Service is horrible.  Came to the carry out counter and waited and waited....  then when asked if I had been helped - there was a glimmer of hope - then the waitress said ok and walked away and more waiting.  6 waitresses later - all asking if I had been helped and all walking away  never to be seen again.  Finally a cook saw I had been waiting 15 minutes to place the order and he came and took the order.  Really ?  How about hiring more people or better people please.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kingsville-2,,,,,
11,Caroline K.,"Flower Mound, TX",0,12,,3.0,2015-05-15,"DO NOT GO IF YOU ARE WANTING QUICK SERVICE. Slowest place in town. With that said, the food had always been good and consistent. The servers are always nice and accommodating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kingsville-2,,,,,
7,Stephanie Z.,"Spring, TX",67,4,1.0,1.0,2015-06-11,"Worst chili's I have ever been to. My chicken was raw the service was so slow and there was almost no one there. The fries were cold, it is obvious they don't take pride in their food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kingsville-2,,,,,
1,Hassan C.,"Kingsville, TX",29,58,98.0,3.0,2015-07-12,Just a mile away from the house open late great food service can get better its not the service but the hostess/ receptionist sees you but ignores you feels like urghhhh !! I hope they fix the problem Before they start loosing more and more customer i have actually seen people walking off even when the restaurants half empty !,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kingsville-2,,,,,
8,Moriah L.,"Omaha, NE",102,37,,3.0,2015-07-19,"Staff is nice but a little slow. Clean place. Very irritating that smoking is allowed in the bar side, ESPECIALLY when you're pregnant and need to go use the restrooms there but don't want to expose your fetus to secondhand smoke. Large menu that changes. Tasty drinks. Burgers are usually done to my liking. Shrimp tacos are tasty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kingsville-2,,,,,
2,Andrew T.,"Austin, TX",149,54,207.0,3.0,2016-01-12,"Since there isn't much variety in Kingsville, Chili's is probably one of the ""fancier"" restaurants you can go to. I've eaten here numerous times in the past 3 years and have ordered take-out here even more times. For the most part, the quality of the food isn't the greatest but it's definitely a step above fast food. There's only really like 3-5 choices in Kingsville when it comes to decent American food and Chili's is probably one of the higher ones on this list. The restaurant is fairly clean and the service is average (depending on how busy they are). There have been a few times where we got phenomenal service from our waiter/waitress and other times where they kind of forgot about us.  You can't really beat the prices here. The ""2 for 20"" deal is what basically got me through college. You can get 1 appetizer and 2 entrees to share with another person for only $20. The selection is pretty good too. Some of my favorite entrees from that menu are the ""Honey Chipotle Chicken Crispers"" and the ""Cajun Pasta"". The food here is consistently good and the portions are generous.  However, the past few times that my roommate and I have gotten take-out, we have noticed the portions are considerably smaller than when they are served on a plate in the restaurant. The ""Ancho Salmon"" I've ordered was noticeably smaller and I'm not even sure if it was cooked all the way (maybe they were in a rush). I decided to try the ""quinoa with wheat berry blend"" as my side because it's new and a bit healthier. It tasted great but the portion was extremely small and it costed an extra dollar to get that as a side. I think next time it'll be better for me just to eat unhealthy than to waste $16 for a small piece of uncooked salmon and a really small portion of quinoa.  Needless to say, I'm not that big of a fan of the Chili's here but the location and the price are both convenient for what they are. You basically get what you pay for (unless you get the salmon).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kingsville-2,,,,,
10,Jennifer J.,"Corpus Christi, TX",10,24,86.0,1.0,2016-02-12,"Second visit here while passing through. First of all, upon entering the restaurant several staff members walked past my friend and I as we stood at the hostess stand for 7 whole minutes. This place was not packed and had plenty of empty tables and booths available. A gentleman finally came to our aid and sat us at a semi dirty table. We sat there. And sat there. And sat there. Finally after about 15 minutes a woman came and asked if we had been helped. We said no and as soon as the word left my lips she replied ""well I guess I'll help you then"". Oh ok. Don't do me any favors. We ordered drinks and appetizers since we weren't sure when we'd see someone again. After about another 20 minutes our chips and salsa and cheese fries came out followed by our drinks. Because that's normal I guess. The cheese fries weren't even warm. I ate a total of 4 fries and focused all my energy on the chips and salsa. Partially bc of their condition when they were delivered to the table and partially bc I had to get up and get my own silverware after attempting to flag down 3 workers. It turns out that our ""waitress"" was the food runner but still. Crappy service. I don't think I'll visit again unless I'm hard up for rudeness, mediocrity and disappointment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kingsville-2,,,,,
12,Joanne A.,"San Antonio, TX",0,5,,1.0,2016-03-15,Have been here on 2 occasions and both times were very poor service. All the waiters have a poor attitude and are rude. Makes the whole experience unpleasant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kingsville-2,,,,,
9,Tayler T.,"Kingsville, TX",0,10,1.0,2.0,2016-04-08,"This place is kinda a joke, but I still keep coming back, if it weren't for their chips and salsa.  They  are ALwAYS out of something. If the Kingsville Chilis was my first time ever going to a Chilis, I'd probably never come back.  Their molten lava cake is pretty bomb though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kingsville-2,,,,,
6,A C.,"Kingsville, TX",10,10,11.0,1.0,2016-05-04,"Wish I could give a minus. Went here on lunch break and of course first had to wait until tables were cleaned off to sit down (6 mins.) minutes. Once the hostess cleaned off a table, we were sitted, a waitress took our order for drinks only. She bought our drinks and said that our assigned waitress would come to take our order. After 15 minutes sitting there I asked another waitress could someone take our order. She said she would get our waitress. No one ever showed up after another 10 minutes. We decided not to wait any longer and to go somewhere else that was a little more organized. But what really took the cake was upon leaving I told the hostess WHY we were leaving, as her and another waitress were wiping a table off, and they looked surprised, the only bright spot was that the waitress cleaning the table offered to take our order as we were leaving. First of all if you are supposed to be a hostess your JOB DESCRIPTION includes making sure ALL customers are taken care and even though it was lunch time the place had plenty of empty tables, they were just dirty. Cleanliness and organization is not available AT THIS LOCATION. Even though there aren't that many places to eat in this small town,I would NEVER recommend this Chili's. It is worth your time and drive to go elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kingsville-2,,,,,
3,Greg K.,"Plano, TX",423,9,,1.0,2016-08-17,"Driving back from S. Padre to DFW, stopped for quick lunch - NOT! Took about 1.25 hours to get cold food, had young children needing to eat, waitress was a laggard, manager had no authority over employees, gave us some gift cards to compensate us - but they didn't work!  AVOID AT ALL COSTS!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kingsville-2,,,,,
5,Cody B.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,1,,1.0,2016-10-26,"Waited over 10 minutes for a hostess to even acknowledge us. We were then told that we would have a fifteen minute wait to be seated. I asked about one of the three tables that people had just left. The hostess said that she was the only one cleaning tables. Evidently it takes 15-20 minutes to clear a table. After walking out of Chili's, the party behind us, also a party of four was seated before we even got to our car. Probably the last time we'll go to Chili's in Kingsville.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kingsville-2,,,,,
4,Susie O.,"Weimar, TX",0,3,,4.0,2017-05-03,Good food.. very crowded. . Because of the Reaignal Track meet that was going on that weekend . but was waited on quickly,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-kingsville-2,,,,,
