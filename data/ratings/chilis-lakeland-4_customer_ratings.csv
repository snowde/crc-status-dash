13,Ad Y.,"Lakeland, FL",0,33,,1.0,2013-06-17,"Borderline disgusting food and horrible service. I received very undercooked broccoli, chicken that was tough and chewy- almost beef jerky like. Flatbread appetizer was beyond salty. Waitress never checked on us or brought drinks. I don't expect a 5 star meal from chili's but this was barely edible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lakeland-4,,,,,

11,Andrea W.,"Winter Garden, FL",11,6,4.0,2.0,2015-03-28,There were 3 hostess at the hostess stand and none if them asked if they could assist us.  I had to say excuse me before they even paid me any attention. This is my first impression and so far I'm not impressed,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lakeland-4,,,,,
10,John H.,"Cape Coral, FL",1,104,37.0,4.0,2015-07-02,"Stopped here on way home, conveniently located off of I-4. Sat in bar area, this way you get free chips and salsa, pretty busy when we were there. Overall food was really good, I had cheeseburger cooked perfectly and wife had pick 2 of the Mexican dishes and she said it was really good. Overall really enjoyed the visit",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lakeland-4,,,,,
7,T W.,"Lakeland, FL",13,138,61.0,3.0,2015-11-05,"We came here on a late night girls night for some dranks and apps. The margarita was good but mostly ice and the salsa was super watery. Our server was great especially since we came 10mins before closed and chilled out a while after. The queso was brown, that was weird and the southwest rolls were not good at all....i guess its like any other plastic food chain but at least the drinks were cheap and the place looked clean...kinda small but clean",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lakeland-4,,,,,
8,Arthur S.,"Boca Raton, FL",3,126,19.0,2.0,2016-02-06,"I had the Chili's all you can eat  Enchiladas. They were just okay but the service was terrible. I sat at the bar and it took them about 40 minutes to bring the first serving of three of them out. But it would have taken even longer if I did not keep reminding the person at the bar to see why it was taking so long. Finally the Manager did bring them out as stated above. At that time I asked the Manager to put another order in of the Chicken Enchiladas. He did bring them in much less time but he failed to mention this time the Plate had been in the Oven and extremely hot. I am always careful but this plate was way too hot and I burnt my hand. I did not require to go to the hospital because I never pick up the Plate fully with both hands, but it was not right to not give me proper warning about how hot the plate was.  By the way don't sit at the bar unless you want some loud mouth smelly guy sticking his nose where it does not belong. This nasty guy said you just want to get your meal for free when I complained about getting burned. He said it over and over again. I said to the Manager I agree and he gave me my $9.95 meal for free. I told this nasty guy to order it and if the second plate comes out of the oven to pick it up to see what happens (at least he will know how hot the plate can be!)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lakeland-4,,,,,
6,Will F.,"Orlando, FL",43,54,17.0,3.0,2016-03-30,"We had an exceptionally large party and I thought the servers handled it very well. The reduction in rating comes from the food. My food was good for the most part, but the black beans with pico was incredibly spicy. I truly enjoy spicy food, but this was HOT. I couldn't imagine someone with even a moderate tolerance of spice finding it enjoyable. The beans were rather bland as well. The rice was dry and empty of flavor. Redeeming the meal was the carnitas and chicken fajitas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lakeland-4,,,,,
3,Jamie G.,"Lake Wales, FL",91,31,14.0,5.0,2017-03-26,"Great service, great food, what more could I want?  I had the pork carnitas tacos and man, I hope they keep those around because they are scrumptious! And their black beans and rice are to die for! I don't even normally like black beans but these were seasoned and cooked to perfection. The wait staff were friendly and were always on the ball with refills (which at other Chili's in the area was uncommon). This was my first visit to this Chili's and I plan to be back, hopefully sooner rather than later.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lakeland-4,,,,,
5,Grant W.,"Homestead, FL",39,12,4.0,1.0,2017-04-21,"Arrived at 11:08 PM with my wife and five very hungry kids on a road trip. We were told there was a half hour wait even though there plenty of empty tables. This is because they closed ""soon"" (midnight) and needed to start shutting down. I don't run a restaurant so I don't know what goes into it, but I sure as heck wouldn't close the restaurant 50 minutes before the time on the sign says. If you want to close at 11, then change the hours. Really mad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lakeland-4,,,,,
2,Jenna T.,"Saint Cloud, FL",78,36,12.0,1.0,2017-07-14,I will not return. I love Chilis and have been to several locations but this particular one is definitely one I will not be returning to. A little about our party... 13 people.. 5 adults and 8 children (11yo - 2yo)... they were absolutely horrible and they took FOREVER to get our meals.. I understand with a large party they'll be a wait but this wait literally took over 90 minutes to get our food and we had spoken to the manager already.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lakeland-4,,,,,
4,Mandi C.,"Longwood, FL",0,4,4.0,1.0,2017-07-16,"Probably one the worst chilis visit. I love chilis and usually it's great customer service, and great food. I had to wait 10 minutes for a table of 4 when it was not busy at all! The host told me ""idk, it's whenever they want a new table"" when I asked how long it's going to be. Had to send my steaks back twice to get the correct temperature I asked for. Overall not a great visit!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lakeland-4,,,,,
0,Judie W.,"Naples, FL",2,17,15.0,5.0,2017-10-18,"Almost didn't stop here because of bad reviews, but my hubby had never been to a Chili's and wanted to go.  Seating was immediate during busy dinner time.  Ordered drinks and apps which came timely, and so did our main meal items.  All food was great and hot.  Staff very friendly and helpful.  Whatever past reviews mentioned that lowered ratings were corrected before this visit.  Very satisfied overall!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lakeland-4,,,,,
1,Stephanie P.,"Lakeland, FL",0,4,,1.0,2017-12-26,"Tonight I ordered curbside, arrived for my order, it was incorrect, entered to let them know, waited 4-5 mins before then even acknowledged me, I let them know the order was incorrect, it was taken back to get corrected yet they still managed to get it wrong after I told them twice what I wanted. This is the worst chili's I've ever visited. The wait is always long, they always get some if not all of the order wrong and the servers all seem to hate their jobs. This place is in desperate need of new management to straighten it out. This will definitely be our last visit here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lakeland-4,,,,,
