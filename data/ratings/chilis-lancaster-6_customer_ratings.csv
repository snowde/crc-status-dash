42,Brandon T.,"Pflugerville, Austin, TX",0,2,,1.0,2014-02-09,I wish I didn't have to give any stars. Worst experience in any restaurant I've ever been to. It started with the 10 minutes it took to be greeted at the door and the additional 10-15 we waited before we saw our waiter. From manager to bartender this staff was completely unattentive and generally didn't care about running a decent establishment. We left and went next door to Logan's and had 100 time better of an experience.

41,Keisha B.,"Dallas, TX",1,21,59.0,1.0,2014-05-01,This was the worse experience ever. The server was very friendly. But the whole ordering process was horrible. We received our room temperature sweet potato fries. An hour later we had to alert the server that it's been an hour and our meals still haven't arrived and our glasses were empty. Finally our food arrived the orders were incorrect. Then it took two attempts for my order to finally get corrected. Then after asking for the manager Wes twice he finally arrived not apologetic at ALL. But was full of excuses and had the nerve to go back and forth. But later says I'll take care of the appetizers. Then I noticed my son didn't eat all his chicken crispers and to our surprise they weren't all the way cook. But Wes was quick to say it was probably the dough or sit in grease. Point of it all this is one of the worse Chills and my family will not be dining here again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lancaster-6?start=40,1.284,1.284,1.284,1.284,1.2840000000000003
28,Denise M.,"Addison, TX",21,19,1.0,1.0,2014-08-19,"Went to this location to meet up with a friend I hadn't seen in years. I was super excited about it so even if the service was average, I would've thought it was fantastic by proxy.  So I find myself ordering combo fajitas. Now, a couple days before, I had PRIMO fajitas from Chuy's so I knew Chili's wouldn't compare, but I figured they'd be okay.  However! I received a cast iron plate of what looked like wolf meat! Lukewarm, grey, scary looking strips of flesh. Was this a secret menu item? Was Little Red Riding Hood trying to get rid of evidence? Was there a Twilight fight in the kitchen and Team Sparkles won? The hell if I know.  Now I'm not one to send food back. That's just asking for extra stuff in your plate you never wanted in the first place. However, I considered talking to the manager regarding a refund. Until I saw that she was rocking a blonde Mohawk and didn't seem the least bit interested in what was going on in her restaurant.  Now, in her defense, if I worked at a Chili's that was just a front for organized crime to dispose of bodies by labeling them as ""fajita meat"", I'd turn the other way too.  Called corporate, told them what happened, got some gift certificates.  By the way, by friend ordered enchiladas and said they were okay. So, there you go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lancaster-6?start=20,1.284,1.284,1.284,1.284,1.2840000000000003

Then, from where the take out order counter was, I could see straight into the kitchen and a couple waitresses looked right at me and still no one greeted me or called for anyone.

They do not employ enough people for the amount of service they receive. Drinks take forever, food takes forever. The managers run around like chickens with their heads cut off just as the regular employees do. Because there are not enough staff, our table (and the empty tables around us) was dirty and stayed that way until someone was seated there. Our waiter was actually really nice and tried to get our orders and drinks as quickly as possible but it all fell short. There is not enough staff to have this place clean and running efficiently.

Most of all, I expect the restaurant to be clean. For the most part, my meal here met that low bar. However, they couldn't get the clean part right. From the wet seat, to the dirty water glass, to the dirty silverware, it was ridiculous and made me wonder just how sanitary my food was. In fairness, the GM was very apologetic and worked hard to make things right. He genuinely wanted us to have a great experience, and I appreciated that. However, he needs to write up his dishwashers because that was an awful effort - one that makes me strongly consider never returning despite the small number of dining options in DeSoto/Lancaster.

We still didn't have the new food by the time our dinner guests were ready to leave. So asked them to box it to go...took another 15 minutes to get it after that!

It was a ridiculously long time. 3rd time, we walked in and no one was at the front to greet us and sit us down. About 5 min in someone walked up and asked if we'd been helped and then said he'd find us a table. Another few minutes went buy and another person came by and asked if we'd been helped and said he'd find us a table. I'm not denying that by this time, we were frustrated. Another few moments went by and finally what looked like a manager came by and realized what was happening and immediately cleaned off a table and sat us down. Great, right? No. He told us that someone would be out shortly and then nothing. About 10 min later after seeing that everyone was catering to other customers but completely ignoring us, we decided to walk out. Walked out and went to On The Border. We will never come to this location again. Poor customer service. Poor management. Poor all over.

While seated, the waiter (who I assumed was the only waiter for our section, being he was the only one I ever saw) never came to ask us for drink orders. Or even acknowledged with a simple ""I'll be right with you."" It wasn't till about 10 mins later that the table next to us dropped a cup and broke it, that a waiter finally came in our direction. After failing to acknowledge us again, we stood up to leave, and he finally acknowledged us with a ""Alright, y'all have a nice day.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lancaster-6,1.4,1.4,1.4,,1.4
11,Daniel G.,"Dallas, TX",0,4,,1.0,2017-02-20,"Deserves a half at best and that's just because we were seated AT LEAST. We went in looking for dinner on a weeknight and it wasn't even packed which was good at first, but once we got seated we sat and waited for 20 minutes before anyone else stopped by to say ""someone will be right with you"" we just got up and left. We've tried this spot before somehow we always leave a little more disappointed. Won't come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lancaster-6,1.4,1.4,1.4,,1.4
10,L. P.,"Burleson, TX",0,11,,1.0,2017-03-12,"Worst service ever. Midday Sunday, no line, no crowds, restaurant only about 1/8th full at best. Came in with family of 6 including 92 yr old mother. Host/manager barely acknowledged us then said about 20 minutes for a table for ""large party"". Plenty of tables for six sitting empty though. Sat for 10 minutes and watched same host seat multiple groups of 4-6 that just walked in. Still no table for us. Would barely give .5 score if I could.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lancaster-6,1.36,1.36,1.36,,1.36
7,Aubrey M.,"Fort Worth, TX",49,14,14.0,1.0,2017-04-07,"Multiple times I've used this Chili's to dine in and a pick up and they are the slowest, worst Chili's I have ever experienced. The staff has one pace which is slow. They seem confused and clueless about how to do their jobs. Customer service and timeliness is not a priority at this location. I absolutely dread having to use this location for anything. On staff management is slow and reluctant to jump in and help unless multiple verbal complaints have been made.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lancaster-6,1.36,1.36,1.36,,1.36
20,Tonya B.,"Dallas, TX",46,33,,2.0,2017-05-07,Sometimes I just want to drive back to Allen and go where I got good service.  This location comes with food problems and extra shot if attitude.  U ordered a flat bread pizza to go.  The flat bread was like wet dough.  When I told the worker she just looked and asked if I want plastic ware... I decided I would cook it at home.  Since I didn't answer fast enough she decided no plastic.  Her comment is now OH SO YOU DO WANT IT.  lady I'm stuck on this raw pizza. I will start going to waxahachie. 4th visit and only one decent visit.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lancaster-6?start=20,1.4,1.4,1.4,,1.4
15,Christian V.,"DeSoto, TX",11,1,,1.0,2017-06-13,"terrible service! we walked in and were seated immediately, however no one ever came over to take our order. my wife called a couple of waitresses and they just looked at him and continued walking. At that point we got up and left. No one even noticed or acknowledged that we left. my wife went back and asked for the manager.All he had to say was if he was loosing our business then he could assure the people my wife was speaking of would no longer be there.  I personally believe that he should train his team and lead by example with good customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lancaster-6,1.36,1.36,1.36,,1.36
3,Staci J.,"Carrollton, TX",18,9,,3.0,2017-08-21,"I have always been a big fan of Chili's restaurants until recently. Since I have moved to the area I have visited the Waxahachie restaurant and the Lancaster restaurant. The Waxahachie restaurant was not good at all. The service was bad and the food was worse. My meal was barely warm by the time we got it and it just tasted like it wasn't freshly cooked. The Lancaster restaurant (high five for banning smoking in the restaurant recently) brought me fajitas that the chicken wasn't cooked completely. I told my waitress and she said, ""oh really I'm sorry it wasn't cooked properly"". That's all, when she should have taken it back to the grill and had them finish cooking it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lancaster-6,1.44,1.44,1.44,,1.44
4,Joseph D.,"DeSoto, TX",0,7,1.0,1.0,2017-09-01,Came in about 11:45 to have a beverage to celebrate our 21st wedding anniversary. We where told we just missed last call by a bartender that looked like she was twelve. So we decided to get a couple of apps and watch some football. She takes our order and goes on to close her bar.  After 15 minutes she goes outside with a cook to hang out while our food sits in the window. We had to ask another server to bring it to us.#justblewyourtip! Five minutes after we start eating she turns off all the TVs as if to say hurry up and get out. #ourlasttimeinChiliesever.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lancaster-6,1.4,1.4,1.4,,1.4
0,Emma L.,"Arlington, TX",2,18,19.0,3.0,2017-11-29,It's an okay spot. Usually if you come during their busy time it's so hard to get a table and to get your food. Usually it's ok but not my favorite place to eat. I had the salad and it seemed that it had been sitting there for a while because my lettuce was on the soggy side.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lancaster-6,1.48,1.48,1.48,,1.48
2,Jennifer B.,"Allen, TX",5,6,,1.0,2017-12-07,Can't even rate the food because we left before we got any because the service was terrible! Waited for at least 20 minutes after we ordered and some how it was too difficult to even bring out our chips and salsa. No manager or servers even walking by to ask about it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lancaster-6,1.48,1.48,1.48,,1.48
1,Josh L.,"Wylie, TX",2,8,2.0,1.0,2017-12-08,"Easy to see why they have bad reviews. We showed up at 8 pm on a Thursday night. The restaurant was half empty, including about 20 large tables, but the hostess unapologetically and without explanation told us it would be a 20 minute wait.   There is plenty of competition in the area, so I can do without this Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lancaster-6,1.48,1.48,1.48,,1.48
