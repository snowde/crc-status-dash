33,Thuyen B.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",155,438,1304.0,4.0,2014-04-08,"Came here for lunch break during the week. We were immediately greeted and seated upon walking in the door, which is great. Restaurant wasn't too crowded and our server was fast and friendly. Drinks and orders came out quickly. And she came back to refill drinks when needed. We ordered the southwestern eggrolls for an appetizer (my favorite and so yum!). For my entree I ordered the lunch special which comes with soup or salad also. I had the southwestern chicken soup and the chipotle flat bread (a half portion of their dinner entree). Soup was good- a little kick of spice in it which was nice. So after the eggrolls and soup I was already getting full. Flat bread was ok I guess. It was too greasy to my liking. I've never ordered flat bread from anywhere before so I guess I'm not a fan if this is how they taste everywhere else also lol. Overall, a good lunchtime option during work. My meal was $7 and it was more than enough food for me!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-largo,2.256,2.256,2.256,2.256,2.256

5,Grant R.,"Clearwater, FL",2,113,52.0,2.0,2015-09-01,"Hey Chilis your impersonal host/hostess system needs help, it is ruining your customer experience (among other high tech things here.). Just waited 40 minutes  by the door and  there at least six empty tables.  It took forever to get people seated each time a customer left and it was due to this computer not doing its job and the hostess not being involved at all due to relying on a computer to tell her a table is ready instead of her eyes. Some technology freak at Chili's headquarters is trying to illiminate jobs and/or make things more efficient while screwing up the customer experience for everyone with their high-tech hostess and seating system.  It doesn't work, it needs way too much work and you have tons of empty tables and are losing money while upsetting customers.  A lose-lose for all.  I have an idea, go back to being more personal and making the hostess talk to the customer and call the customer and stop trying to be high-tech.  This way people don't wait 30 to 45 minutes for a table when there about 15% or more of the tables are available to sit at and your hostess doesn't do anything but stare at a computer the whole time.   Even my waitress who took my food order didn't deliver it.  In fact I think I only saw her twice.. And when an item was missing from my order I couldn't find her either and had to ask someone else.  At the end of the meal I guess I don't need to see her either so I simply slid my credit card through some little computer they left on the table with a dirty touchscreen and left.  I am guessing in the next few years I'll come in on the computer will be actually serving me too. I feel like an old man writing this review but I'm pretty sure I'm in the demographic of a Chili's customer.  What is with restaurants these days?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-largo?start=20,1.576,1.576,1.576,1.576,1.576

8,DeShawn M.,"Largo, FL",31,6,33.0,1.0,2015-12-02,"What a complete disappointment.  My boyfriend and I were craving nachos and were on our way home from work so we tried to think of some where that would have great classic nachos.  We eliminated a couple of decent Mexican joints in the neighborhood and I said oh I bet you Chili's has good nachos, I'll call an order in and pick them up and meet you back home.  So I called and was greeted by a friendly voice, I said I'd like to place an order and pick it up curbside.  I was immediately put on hold and waited while I continued to drive towards Chili's.  About 5 minutes and 3 miles later some one comes back on the phone to take my order.  The order process was lengthy by the time the order was actually placed I was pulling in to Chili's.  Luckily I had an errand I could run at Staples, so I ran there and went back to Chili's.  The order came out promptly and I was super excited to get the nachos I was craving all day. The server was friendly and helpful.  I dashed home and said baby I'm home, I got the nachos.  So we sit down to eat and to our complete shock when we opened up the to go box and saw...I'm not joking 11 NACHO CHIPS with cheese and a tiny bit of meat and beans spread under the cheese individually placed like they were little nuggets of gold in the box. A few tiny containers of sour cream, guac, salsa.   I can't even believe Chili's has the nerve to charge $11 for this.  Seriously $1 per nacho chip with a little bit of stuff on it.  Usually a plate of nachos will fill 2 people up, this left us both fighting over the last chip and still starving.  I haven't been that disappointed in a pick up order ever.  Felt totally ripped off.  I'm not a frequenter of Chili's but this certainly made me realize there is no reason to be.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-largo?start=20,1.4760000000000002,1.4760000000000002,1.4760000000000002,1.4760000000000002,1.4760000000000004

Came with my mom and she got her food and had to get back to work so she left and I had to eat alone and once she left a hour later mg food finally came out with the right stuff.

2,Kaitlyn S.,"Saint Petersburg, FL",0,1,,2.0,2017-04-24,"Very unimpressed. Should have listened to other reviews. Came at 3:40pm on a Monday. Was sat after a few minutes, when we got to the table the host wiped off the booth with her hand, mumbled something under her breath, then walked away leaving me confused. So I waited for a minute before I sat thinking she'd come back with a towel to wipe it off but when she never showed back up I just sat down. 10 mins later after seeing a few different waitresses walk by someone finally came up to me asking if so and so had been here yet. When I said no she decided to take the table over. She promptly took my order and got my drink. Unfortunately the chips from the chips and salsa were not very good today which is unlike chilis. And I was really disappointed with my Cajun pasta dish, very bland and dry unlike usual. Oh well. As I was paying I overheard a manager at another table, not sure what their problem was but I'm sure it was a similar experience to mine, his answer to resolve the issue ""well we just switched managers so I'm not sure what I'm walking into right now."" Really? Lol. That's your answer? I tried really hard to enjoy my meal and the only good thing about this chilis was the server Kendall picking up everyone else's slack. Kendall, you should try looking for a better establishment to work for, this place is subpar in relation to your effort for excellent service. I'm hoping with this review they will recognize the job you're doing for them as a valuable employee.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-largo?start=20,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48

35,IM M.,"Clearwater, FL",12,2,,1.0,2017-05-29,"We have been visiting this Chilis for many years but recently it has really gone down hill...... absolutely awful I ordered chicken crispers not crispy chicken crispers...they were extremely well done greasy nasty smell of old oil!!!!! I complained and they replaced with a new plate of crispers within 2 minutes!!! A little less well cooked but I really think they are pre cooked at this location and just thrown in nasty old oil to heat up before serving!! We also ordered Steak that was full of fat sent back this was replaced but oozing with blood when we asked for Medium! The manager didn't apologize he just told us the steak was cooked to medium and that's how it is served! The Manager was a real prat and wrong I think he may be new here we haven't  noticed him before. He took half off the two meals we had sent back but only after we called him over when we received the bill, the tenders were still on the plate! If you want a reasonable priced meal that's great food go to Cheddars down the road..... And try their Chicken Crispers/tenders they are excellent. I wouldn't feed the dog the nasty smelly dirty oil covered crispers this Chilis served. If the oil in the fryer is so nasty I can't imagine what the cleanliness of the kitchen is like, as I mentioned earlier this location was good a while ago, one of the previous lady managers was extremely switched on very good at her job and knew her regular customers.

26,Cheyenne S.,"Largo, FL",0,6,2.0,2.0,2017-06-11,"We ordered on the app for curbside to go to get there, grab the food, and get home when we realized that the sides they had given us were black beans and a side of rice when we ordered corn, broccoli, and loaded potatoes. I did not think a meal for three would be this difficult. Upon going back they told us they were out of broccoli (the one thing our daughter wanted). So much for an easy night of pick-up food. This is also not the first time they have messed up our order and we don't specify anything extra we just grab the regular things on the menu. On a side note, I really wish they would put the fajita mix-ins (sour cream, cheese, avocado..) in their separate plastic cups like they used to, now they are all mooshed together in a foam, square box and for someone who doesn't like the avocado (with no option to subtract it on the app like they also used to have) I get all of those mix-ins mixed together.

Bad idea. It's always something. They changed the 2 for 20 to 2 for 22 which was a huge deal. I wanted the fajitas and they were out of the meat. The margarita was awful. I got the ribs instead. They were blah. Very bland not flavorful at all. I also got the corn on he cob which used to be so good. It was just soaked in plain water forever with no flavor. No butter just sprinkled a little pepper on it. My husband got the roasted corn for $1 more. Basically it's the same corn with a sprinkle of seasoning. It was no better. The chips and salsa was the best thing we got but we had so many because it took so long to get our food that we were to full to really even eat. No more chances chili.

23,Justin T.,"Clearwater, FL",22,48,,2.0,2017-10-16,"Folks, the sign on the outside may say Chili's, but the similarity to the excellent versions of this franchise in the Tampa Bay area ends there. Take my advice and STAY AWAY from this location. If there was ever a clear case of what bad management can do to sink a restaurant this is it. I went on 10-15-17, and felt like I was in one of those auto garages in a small town where you are out of place and totally unwelcomed.  It seems only the workers and a few straggling regulars hang out there, and they talk among themselves about the most trivial stuff you can imagine (""who ate the brownie that was in the employee fridge?""). They acted like they couldn't be bothered to do their jobs. I have never seen a place with so little interest in acting like a professional.  Corporate should find out and investigate.  My simple order of a burger took 20 minutes to arrive even though I did not see food being served to anyone in view. God knows what was really going on in the kitchen. When it did arrive, it was decent, but not nearly as good as the same burger I had just 3 days before at the WONDERFUL location on Dale Mabry in Tampa near the stadium. This Largo dive also seemed to draw very obese people to it in both the workers and the customers, and I'm sorry, it is just not pleasant to be surrounded by people who don't respect their own bodies.

He had to send the crispers back because they were dripping with grease. Change your oil or turn up the heat! The corn tasted water logged!
