That being said, I have realized that it is not worth it to order a steak there. When it is done correctly, their steaks are excellent, but about 75% of the time, it is wrong. And isn't even consistently under or over cooked so you could just adjust how you order your steak. I always order medium well, but sometimes it comes back raw in the middle, and sometimes it comes back dry and shrunken like a hockey puck. They always fix it, but then you are waiting for your food while everyone else in your group is eating. And as previously stated in other reviews, the management has NO concept of how to properly make right for mistakes of this nature.

Order took about another 10 minutes. By the time my order was ready and ready to check out my lunch was half over.  Then the lady at the pick up counter tells me my bill amount is wrong. I showed her my online receipt saying the total for my order and items matched. She insisted I needed to wait for the manager. I had no time for this. It was my lunch. I will not be patronizing this location. I suggest going to other places other than this location. The manager did call me later on to tell me she would honor whatever the price was.

Saturday night has a little more crying children but overall ok. Got seated in a half booth. The other side of booth had one chair and felt a little odd.  Very good waitress. We got the 2 for $20 meal. Queso, chips and salsa for starters. Waitress only charged us 50¢ more for queso because not on 2 for $20 menu so that was great!  Queso & chips always delish. Had 1/2 rack if ribs with broccoli. Ribs were very good and just enough. Broccoli is usually good but not this visit. Not steamed good. Tasted raw and hard. Did not like at all today.  Other person had 6 oz sirloin with potatoes and broccoli. They were pleased with their meal. Draft beer and glass of wine was perfect with the meal. :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lawrenceville-4?start=20,,,,,

We called ahead of time, got there at 11:15, and were pretty much the only people in the whole place. It took them almost 20 mins to come get our orders, and then the food came out so sporadically that some students were done with their meal while the others had not even received it yet. We were given one waitress for a group of 17 of us. A majority of the orders were not correct but because of time constraints we could not send them back. By this time, people around us had come, ordered, paid and left. Finally around 12:00, we said we wanted our check. Our waitress had to bring out checks 3 different times because she kept messing them up. We didn't get out of there until close to 1. The most frustrating thing was they were not accommodating with our children at all. They were rude and our kids noticed it. We will not be going back there for a skills trip!

Again I was trying to go for quick, so probably my own fault. I went with the 2 for $20. The fried pickles were great! Good batter and tart. The cajun chicken pasta was very flavorful at first but then the flavor just turned into salty salty salty. So much that I couldn't keep eating it. The bacon burger was good too. Also a bit salty for me. It had flavor for sure. Overall, not terrible but if you have high blood pressure you might want to mention to them to go light on the seasonings and salt.

Our servers have all been very friendly and helpful, just slow. Maybe they're understaffed? What I also find odd about Chili's is that they always tell you that you will have two servers during your meal, but we've only ever had one.

2,Jennifer L.,"Suwanee, GA",37,190,86.0,2.0,2017-04-01,"I visited on a Saturday at 2:00 pm. They were busy, but not super slammed. The hostess greeted us promptly and we were immediately seated. It took a few minutes for the server to acknowledge us for our drink order, but not long enough to wonder where she was. We ordered draft beers, which they do have a decent selection of...maybe 8-10 different taps. She sat the beers down and walked away, prompting me to call her back to take our order as we were ready...not sure why she didn't ask. Food-took a reasonable amount of time to hit the table, but this is where the problem lied. Everyone had hot, fresh food, except me. I ordered the Buffalo Chicken salad. Upon my first bite, the chicken was ice cold. I'm generally not a complainer, but this was inedible. I had to wait until the server was nearby to get her attention, as she never once came over on her own to check on the table. The icing on the cake was the wait for my new salad....20 minutes for a piece of hot chicken. Everyone else has consumed their lunch before my corrected plate was delivered. I'm not saying my meal should have been free, but a coupon or a free drink or something (anything!) goes a long way in making things right. After I got the order, one would think their server would come by to make sure it was okay, perhaps offer drink refills, or even a water to go with the beers. Nope. Nada. Zip.

We have always had attentive and friendly servers, very welcoming and willing to work with you. I use the myplenti points and get rewards and coupons (I told you, we're big fans.) and whenever the computer doesn't read them, the manager comes out and helps immediately. Once he even just gave it to us without bothering with the coupon. 10/10 customer service.  The food is pretty much always good; we have had off nights but the food is always at least 7.5/10 even on the worst visits. Fajitas are amazing, as well as beans and rice. SO GOOD. 2 for $22 is a good deal and the steak is usually very flavorful. Chips and salsa are endless so go to town. Salsa isn't too spicy and it doesn't fill you up too much.
