Bartender was funny and made our drinks fast!! I just love to go there for the margaritas and guacamole!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lawton?start=20,,,,,
1,Owen T.,"Lawton, OK",0,5,,2.0,2012-10-24,Service is unacceptably slow during off peak hours. Complimented with sub par server friendliness this place is probably the worst chilis I have been to. Typical Lawton service which is unfortunate at a late chain restaurant,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lawton?start=20,,,,,
22,Meagan P.,"Lawton, OK",11,18,10.0,1.0,2013-03-01,"I am going to go ahead and put it out there that I have worked in the restaurant industry for 8 years on and off and have done every job in the front of the house from host to management.  My husband and I went in last night and sat at the bar. First let me note that when we walked in there was no one there to greet us. Not sure where the host/hostess was but we just stood there looking lost. Finally we decided to just sit at the bar. The bartender seemed nice but he hardly spoke. He got our drink order and made our drinks and gave us menus. It took a good 10 minutes before he spoke to us again to ask for our order. He didn't take the time to write it down so when he went to put it in the computer he kept having to turn around and ask us again.  From the time he put in our order it took a good 30 minutes plus to get our food. (which is ridiculous considering they weren't even busy) When our food did come out it was ran by a manager who handed us the food and ran off (didn't bother to make sure everything was okay or make sure we had everything we needed).  We each ordered a triple dipper and I had mine with 2 orders of eggrolls and 1 order of the boneless buffalo wings. The boneless wings had some sort of tortilla or something stuck to one of them that had apparently been in the sauce bowl that my wings were tossed in. It was gooey and disgusting looking. I picked it off of my wing and set it off to the side where the bartender could clearly see it. He never once even tried to remove it from my view or ask how the food was.  The food was absolutely terrible. It came out cold and my husband's burger bites were so dry he could barely choke them down. We watched the bartender for awhile and he was very very slow. There were 10 people tops sitting at the bar and he could barely keep up. We will not be back to this Chili's. It was a waste of $36.   Also, a word of advice to bartender John, learn how to multi-task. It took a good 10 minutes for him to make 5 tickets worth of drinks because he was so scatter brained about it.  One other complaint I had, we could clearly hear bantering and roughhousing from the staff while we were sitting at the bar, not to mention, someone in the back of the restaurant was either kicking or banging on one of the walls near the to-go area and it was actually really disturbing while we were trying to enjoy our dinner and have a conversation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lawton,,,,,
25,Jennifer H.,"Fort Worth, TX",41,176,14.0,2.0,2013-04-06,Everytime I go to Chili's I swear it is the last....I think Chili's and Applebee's must be sisters because they both equally suck. The drinks are to damn sweet and the customer service is better at 7-11! But hey I guess it is better than no food. :/,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lawton,,,,,
4,Blake T.,"San Luis Obispo, CA",0,8,,1.0,2013-07-12,"Going to start off with the word that describes this place the best. Horrible. I ordered food to go and I ended up with a completely flavorless steak. For a second I thought maybe I had gotten sick or something so I tried the mashed potatoes to make sure and I was definitely not sick because there was a chunk of avocado it.....a week later I ordered a turkey roasted sandwich with no tomatoes....I didn't get any tomatoes on it but half (That's right I said HALF) of the sandwich had avocado on it when I didn't even ask for it. Which to me means that someone put avocado on half the sandwich then realized ""Oops it didn't say green disgusting ball of yuck on it.....oh well I'll just leave this half like that!"" I love to eat...I'm not to picky when it comes to my steaks...but the fact that my order was so messed up is sad...I mean the steak I had in Iraq that I BBQd with gasoline and put hot sauce on tasted better than this....PLEASE DO NOT EAT HERE!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lawton?start=20,,,,,
0,R R.,"Chino Hills, CA",0,10,,5.0,2014-06-23,Went to chili's with large party for a BCT graduation dinner.  I called ahead to make reservations and they were accommodating.  The food was good and came out promptly and hot.  We received exceptional service from Nadia.  She was great.  Loved the sweet tea.  They don't have that at chilis back in California .,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lawton?start=20,,,,,
21,Jennifer J.,"Lawton, OK",2,13,10.0,4.0,2014-10-06,"Been here twice this week since we received a gift card. Went on Saturday night and sat in the bar area. Food was outstanding and wasn't a long wait, were in and out pretty quick. Went again today with my kids and service was alright....feel like we could've been checked on a little more. The new tablet things they have on the table are pretty neat. 2 for 20 is the way to go. Cheese fries are good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lawton,,,,,
23,Mike L.,"Lawton, OK",0,2,,1.0,2014-11-25,Really Pathetic lots of empty tables still 30 minutes to wait.  Very poor service. Wanted a decent meal with out stress she got lost with getting our drinks a water and coffee wife's food came out veggie plate under cooked (freezer cold) brocoli instant mash potatoes really generic flavor the plus fried apples. Mine ribs overcooked Jerky with a bone.  Waitress did not seem to care. Cramped up at a kid table,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lawton,,,,,
17,Matthew B.,"Marion, NC",23,70,3.0,2.0,2015-04-22,"Had a less than desirable experience here a few weeks ago.. Waitress ""forgot"" some of our drinks, ""Forgot"" our dipping sauces and ""forgot"" half our food. We ended up getting ALMOST everything after asking 3-4 times for it, but still very lacking service. When i asked her to knock off the bill for ""Forgetting"" my salad completely, she laughed and did no such thing. Luckily the management at this location is understanding and did so instead.  It wasn't so much the bad service, as it was her LAUGHING when I complained. She needs to find a new job.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lawton,,,,,
24,Jamie G.,"Lawton, OK",0,25,5.0,3.0,2016-01-08,"It took awhile for the waitress to come to our table, but once she came the service was good. The food was just okay. When I came for lunch before it was better. I had the chicken lunch fajitas today",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lawton,,,,,
18,Chris C.,"Miami, FL",76,106,447.0,4.0,2016-03-21,"After reading the reviews on here I had to check it out and make sure that my beloved ""go to"" ""fast food"" place was as bad as its been discredited to be. The service we received was great, the food was just as amazing as always as were the drinks. One and only complaint is the cleanliness of this establishment. The screens on the tables were all so filthy and sticky I actually think old my waiter to remove it from our table because I was disgusted by it. The menus were also sticky. As soon as I mentioned it though I noticed everyone started cleaning the screens and menus which I think is awesome that they took initiative right away to correct the addressed concern. It's chilies not a 5 star restaurant I don't know what you ppl expect this is Lawton. There isn't much going on here. The reviews I read are way off based on my actual experience. I feel people had unrealistic expectations. This is not Mr. Chow. -.-",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lawton,,,,,
8,Annette V.,"Lawton, OK",118,27,96.0,4.0,2016-05-05,"Our waitress Courtney was on point.. great personality, fun to chat with... even though it looked like she was handling the whole bar area herself. yummy drinks,  food was good. Hadn't been here in a while... but glad we came here tonight!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lawton,,,,,
16,Jack B.,"Honolulu, HI",1,18,1.0,1.0,2016-06-15,"Seems like they rehired the terrible ex-manager.  I used to hate this specific Chiles, then it seemed to have turned around.  Today, 15 June 16 (7-9pm) we had to wait 5 minutes to even talk to a hostess even though half the tables were empty.  After finally getting seated, our meal took over an hour and a half before served.  Keep in mind that there were only a few other tables occupied.  The waiter informed me that the manager wanted to give me  a lousy $10 coupon, which hardly made up  the terribly cooked food, time lost waiting, and and having to put the kids to bed late.  The poor waiter was doing fine, but there is obviously mismanagement at this specific Chiles.  Horrible and not going back to this Chiles.  Too bad- and two thumbs down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lawton,,,,,
19,Song F.,"Oklahoma City, OK",3,12,,1.0,2016-08-21,Just ate here after a good movie.Queso came out like warm instead of steaming like the one a table behind me received. My fajita came out Luke warm where I can handle the iron skillet with my bare hands while another table was receiving the same thing sizzling. Asked the waiter why my fajita was not hot and sizzling when it came out...she said it is the sauce that makes it sizzle ... I know better that if my food was hot then it would sizzle with the sauce on top but waiter made it sound like there was no sauce in mine and hence no sizzle or steam but yet I was able to handle the skillet with my bare hands! Then my husband received enchiladas that were so hard and wrong side dish which were sent back for fresh ones. According to manager it would take 4 1/2 minutes but ended up taking much longer because according to manager they had to redo the dish more then once. The dish finally came out when it was time to go hence my husband did not really get to eat except for salty old chips and onion ring appetizer that came out with the main meal. Did not ask for comp since manager and waiter seemed not to care and my husband still tipped well against my wishes but will be awhile before returning to this place!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lawton,,,,,
9,Thomas W.,"Lawton, OK",162,96,54.0,4.0,2016-08-31,"Sitting in the Bar area is decent to sit in, if you plan on having food, this is still a good option. I have been here several times. The only thing I have trouble with is the that the bartenders are at points not available and there is a long wait for drinks. The food at this location has always came out as expected, as requested and awesome. The staff here is good, I don't appreciate all the ones at the door who look at people like they are better than them. The place is always clean and welcoming for the most part with the prior exception. The waiting staff seems to fly through the place and check on you often. I would eat here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lawton,,,,,
14,Sherill M.,"Dallas, TX",3,308,32.0,1.0,2016-09-19,"Should have checked the reviews. Some if the worst food ever. To go order was supposed to be ready at 7pm. At 7:30 it had not been prepared. When it finally arrived, everything was cold and STALE, just awful! I asked the to remake and they rolled their eyes. I had a strawberry lemonade that tasted like water. Once they remade the food, the wings were still old almost mushy, no freshness. Also, they changed their BBQ sauce and it is dreadful! WTF, people have been enjoying that sauce for years. If it ain't broke don't fix it idiots! Food used to be good. Chili's fell off bad, so over it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lawton,,,,,
11,Jeff D.,"Cedar Lake, IN",38,62,34.0,5.0,2016-09-30,"Excellant Food.  Had the Prime Rib fajitas which comes out on a sizzling hot skillet with cheese guacamole, pico de gallo and sour cream.  Chilis was clean and staff was friendly and attentive to our needs.  Others had guacamole burger with onion rings which was tasty and a rib eye steak which was cooked just as ordered medium rare.  Very good experience here in Lawton, Oklahoma",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lawton,,,,,
15,Leah S.,"Lawton, OK",50,6,,5.0,2016-10-18,"Wow never thought I'd ever leave a 5 star review on the Lawton chilis! And honestly the food was subpar but our server (also the bartender, I can not remember his name) MADE the visit! He was very attentive, friendly, and embodied everything good customer service should be!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lawton,,,,,
12,Jay S.,"San Antonio, TX",0,29,1.0,1.0,2016-11-11,"Like most other restaurants within the Lawton city limits, the service is probably the worst I have ever had. When I got back from Iraq, I went to chilis for dinner. This location was crowded but I was seated and ordered fajitas. Other patrons were seated, ordered, got their food and left. By this point I was staying merely out of curiosity. The waitress repeatedly said, ""5 more minutes every 15 minutes.""  The fajitas arrived after 90 minutes and the skillet was cold to the touch. I brought this to her attention and she said that she could reheat it. I asked for the manager who offered to reheat it. I explained that I was dissatisfied and would not pay for the meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lawton,,,,,
13,Kim F.,"Plano, TX",5,3,2.0,1.0,2016-12-26,"Horrible experience.   We split a burger and it was not prepared as requested. The server took 1/2 the burger back to have a new one fired up. The half of the burger that was sent back and a manager delivered it with a new half bottom bun that never even hit the grill; it was a bun pulled out of the bag, cut in half, and put on the bottom. I spoke with the manager a second time who said he would credit the burger ... apparently he said he would credit 1/2 the burger...  really, that's not what I  heard.  Sure enough the bill came and they credited 1/2 a burger.  How ridiculous is that, not to mention it wasn't for the entire cost of half the burger as we ordered the grass-fed which had an additional up charge.   This is about the principle of the matter (not about the cost; it was a $10 burger)... again, what manager decides to credit 1/2 a burger.  Additionally, the bill charged us for 2 bowls of soup.  I asked to speak to the manager again.  A different manager came out credited the whole burger and removed the extra bowl of soup and was sincere about the poor experience.   There were some pretty basic things that caused this to be a bad customer experience and could have been turned around easily;   Quality checks before food leaves the kitchen and empowering managers to do the right thing for the customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lawton,,,,,
7,Pinky S.,"Lawton, OK",119,15,47.0,5.0,2017-05-31,"Had a great experience at this Chilis. Jenessa was a wonderful waitress and was very assertive. Noticed anytime our drinks were low and never left us too long without asking if we needed anything, but at the same time was not standing there every time we turned around to be annoying.   The food was great, he had the chicken burrito and I had the bacon ranch quesadilla. Both were great without any issues.  Burrito was huge and quesadilla was very filling.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lawton,,,,,
10,Greg M.,"Lawton, OK",0,7,,2.0,2017-07-02,"I have been to this Chilis dozens of times and have never been disappointed. However, today was my first take-out order. I got the bacon cheeseburger with an egg added. Technically I was provided a bacon cheeseburger, since there was one piece of bacon, but I really expected more. I know the burgers will never look like the picture, but come on, one measly piece of fatty bacon? Guess I need to try out all the new burger joints in town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lawton,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6
