8,Lois B.,"Boxborough, MA",0,2,,5.0,2013-03-03,After walking out of TGI Friday's we went to Chili's just up the street and were greeted very quickly with a waiter and had fast service with delicious food.  Definitely will go back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-leominster-4?start=20,,,,,
29,Ran D.,"Worcester, MA",74,229,76.0,4.0,2013-07-01,"When your on the road a lot, and it's getting late the Chili's sign is a is a sight for soar eyes. I love there new 2.99 Pabst draft specials, it comes in a glass that looks like a can, it's the little things.  Despite waaaay too much salt they still are the raining champs of chips and salsa land.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-leominster-4,,,,,
0,Robert C.,"Worcester, MA",128,29,32.0,1.0,2014-02-02,"Let me tell you how my experience here at this chili's went.  I am extremely disappointed in the quality of food they had the audacity to serve to me and my date last night. Straight up, prisoners eat better prepared meals than what we had had. We both ordered the new items on the menu, in which the pictures look irresistible to both of us, the Chipotle Mex Bowl and some other overrated fodder, annnnd after a long wait, ""food"" came out and suddenly I had lost my appetite. There were a billion things to complain about but to name a few:  looked nothing like what they advertise, was clearly a half-assed meal that has been microwaved, was missing a bunch of things like salsa, avocado, tortilla crisps, corn, garnishes, and  I'm sure more, rice and cheese were hardened (microwaved), lettuce was already brown, looked like they just slapped on some rice and beans and called it a day, was double plated because the top plate was ""extremely hot"" because it has been MICROWAVED, proportions were off, it was not done neatly and did not look at all appetizing and YET THE WAITRESS STILL BROUGHT IT OUT FOR US TO EAT?! TO ASK US IF THE FOOD WAS OKAY?! ... To compensate for our troubles, they had brought us out another bowl of crispy rice and a house salad of old veggies. And a pitiful $10 coupon. I was ever so delighted. I can go to Taco Bell and still be completely satisfied but to eat here at this restaurant just ruined not only my night, but my entire perspective of chain restaurants at whole. I don't understand how customers put up with this. I'm disappointed in the management, the cooks, the preppers, and the servers for conjuring up this mess and serving it and expecting me to pay but I was nice and paid my meal, tipped the waitress and off i went with a new lesson learned. Do not trust pictures and this specific restaurant is garbage. That is all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-leominster-4?start=20,,,,,
3,Miss C.,"Watertown, MA",1,21,,2.0,2014-03-05,"I try to avoid chains, but sometimes you just figure that maybe it would be decent enough for a stop. Nope. Waitress was busy, I get it, I do...I am forgiving...but when she doesn't bring out what you ordered/gets it wrong...but doesn't check in to make sure it was correct or to ask how it was...it just doesn't help. I always will sit patiently until it can be fixed. there were a couple of things gone wrong, but they were fixed eventually... then she offers to buy dessert, but I don't want dessert...I just want to get out of there while I am still young! I don't know, comp something. Then she says ""oh I hate when I go out and everything is not right with my order"" Well then, wouldn't you try a little harder not to be the waitress that messes people orders? The shrimp tacos were ok, I made some at home the next week and they were ten times better. The rice was dry and chewy. The beans were ok.  My husband had ribs, both kinds...he said ""meh"" they are always talking about Chili's baby back ribs, but there are so many better one's out there...I think even Texas Roadhouse is better if I had to go and pick a comparable chain (even they aren't that good of a restaurant, either)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-leominster-4?start=20,,,,,
23,Shauna L.,"Leominster, MA",30,128,241.0,3.0,2014-04-26,"A good place to hang at the bar and have some snacks and Rita's! Standard chain, but writer than TGIFs in the same plaza.

27,Jennifer J.,"Westminster, MA",50,57,13.0,2.0,2014-08-09,"Oh Chili's~ I read your negative reviews and decided to give you a chance anyways... What a mistake.  I took my mother out to dinner here tonight, below I'm just going to break it down into the pros and cons. Pros: Our waiter was nice The restaurant was clean Food came out fast Cons:   My salad had way too much dressing and was soggy. The guacamole shown in advertisements was much different than what we got, not to mention how much I dislike when establishments add salt to tortilla chips so customers will drink more. I probably will not return to this location again.  Bad experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-leominster-4,,,,,
24,Patrick G.,"Upton, MA",15,115,22.0,4.0,2015-01-05,"Food and service were great at this location. Just be careful because they charge you 1.99 to use that tablet thing at the table, they list it as ""table entertainment"". Other than that, the food was hot and came out fast and the waitress was attentive and pleasant. Overall, this was a pretty good Chilis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-leominster-4,,,,,
25,Jose M.,"Lancaster, MA",14,44,9.0,1.0,2015-07-03,"Pedestrian at best.

1,Darrin P.,"Leominster, MA",0,3,2.0,2.0,2015-09-01,Bad attention to detail and knowledge with waitress's on order. Gluten free issues and order not correct on other dishes.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-leominster-4?start=20,,,,,
21,Eric W.,"Westfield, MA",10,212,333.0,2.0,2015-10-19,"Walked in to order two to go meals. Nobody was around and I had to ask a waitress and she went out back and got him.

26,Brandon R.,"Leominster, MA",63,4,,1.0,2016-03-10,I went there tonight to eat. First it too forever to recieve our beverages and then when they brought the food out they brought my order out 5 mins after everyone else's. When I got my food the steak was extremely under cooked and my sides were wrong. When I complained a person who said he was a a manager came over. He was very unprofessional. Couldn't tell he was the manager and he acted like he didn't care. I would never recommend this place to anyone!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-leominster-4,,,,,
28,Cheryl W.,"Townsend, MA",0,5,,1.0,2016-05-21,Stopped there tonight and walked out after noticing that they changed to lightbulbs that are so dark I needed a flashlight to see my menu.  Turn on the lights and I might come back.  I have been going there and enjoying it for years but I will not go there in near darkness.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-leominster-4,,,,,
20,Adam F.,"Manchester, NH",0,10,,1.0,2016-06-10,"Went here and ordered 2 for $20 and a kids meal. The 2 for $20 came out which we both ordered fajitas. We then proceeded to wait approximately 15 minutes for the kids meal to arrive which consisted of a grilled cheese sandwich and a side of broccoli. The excuse was that the cook burned the first grilled cheese.  The food was terrible. Peppers and onions were still raw, my sons broccoli was still raw, the pico, sour cream and shredded cheese tasted like the inside of a dirty refrigerator. I emailed the cooperate people and they sent us a gift certificate. Thanks.... but we will never return and it's too bad because we have slowly seen a decline at this particular restaurant. Every time we have visited this place something was not right and given excuses with offers from staff like ""would you like a basket of fries or sorry the cook burned your meal""  Our waitress took our order but 2 different people brought the fajitas to our table. We assumed the grill cheese sandwich was on its way but again we waited 15 minutes until our waitress came to check in with us. She acted surprised that they never brought out the sandwich. You take our order and you deliver the food to our table, it's not rocket science. That way it ensures a correct order and people are not left waiting. Don't waste your time here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-leominster-4,,,,,
18,Sarah M.,"Sudbury, MA",22,13,,1.0,2016-07-24,"This restaurant is usually great, but service today was close to the worst I have experienced. We walked in were offered to sit in the dinning room or bar. We asked to sit in the dinning room and the hostess said she had to clean off a both (clearly at least 15+ booths open) we were sat by someone else and proceeded to sit for 10 minutes with waiters and waitresses walking by without acknowledgement, so we got up and left. Really sad, this was a frequent stop for us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-leominster-4,,,,,
22,Eric D.,"Leominster, MA",1,37,,2.0,2016-08-13,"Has anyone else noticed that chain restaurants seem to be in a steady decline? I mean they were never a superb dining experience, but they were suitable to bring a small family for a decent meal at an ok price. These days, prices climbing while service and food quality declining seems to be the norm. This place is no exception, unfortunately. Mediocre food served by people who would rather not be there is what you'll find. Search for other options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-leominster-4,,,,,
16,Liz R.,"Leominster, MA",0,22,1.0,2.0,2016-08-19,"I didn't really want to write this review but I feel obligated to after my experience. I went out to dinner with my girlfriends recently on a weeknight at this Chili's location. We sat ourselves in the lounge but it took almost 15 minutes for anyone to come over and take our drink order. They weren't particularly busy so that threw me off a bit. I ordered the Tropical Sunrise Margarita which was way too heavy on the Dekuyper melon liqueur and overall very sour. We asked the waitress if we could have some chips and salsa which we assumed were still gratis at Chili's, but we found out they were not. My friend asked for a side of guacamole with the chips and salsa we already had and our waitress came back with a whole new side of chips with the guacamole. When our check came we were charged $6 in total for the chips, salsa, and guacamole. She asked for a side of guacamole not another whole order of your $4 chips, pretty disappointing and sneaky. We arrived at 7:05pm and our food did not come out until after 8pm, at this point the restaurant was not full, maybe they were understaffed? I don't know. Our waitress seemed to be rushed, distracted and annoyed and did not check up on our table very often. Overall my experience was less than great and I hope this location can improve upon their customer service. Additional comments: I was on the Chili's website earlier in the day to see if they had any drink specials that night and for the Leominster location it listed that on Thursday's they offer $5 Presidente Margaritas so I asked to order one and she said that they were not $5 and that she could make me one for around $8 and I showed her the Chili's website page with the promotion and again she told me they wouldn't honor the offer. Honestly really disappointing, why would this offer be posted on the Chili's website if you are not going to honor it? I guess I will be sticking with the 99 Restaurant for their delicious always $3.99 house margaritas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-leominster-4,,,,,
15,Aaron S.,"Townsend, MA",16,93,19.0,2.0,2016-10-23,"Two stars because the food is always amazing. Service sucks, EVERY TIME. Tonight we did a to-go order... online system was down for this location. Called it in. Get there, no one at the pickup area just a sign saying to go to the bar. Bar's a third full, had to wait forever to ask for the food. Meanwhile other workers are just meandering around and chatting with each other. Get home... they forgot our fries. 20 minutes away... not going back. Fail.  Every other time when we've eaten in, the waitress disappears and never checks on the food or to bring the bill. Too bad as the prices are great and we love the food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-leominster-4,,,,,
11,Lila S.,"Hubbardston, MA",253,422,277.0,2.0,2017-02-06,"**review is for Catering Take out ONLY*** I'll be honest here -I hadn't been to Chili's in many moons  so Curb Side to Go was foreign to me and I'd opted for the easy way out and decided to do take out rather than make my own goodies for the super bowl.  Lets talk about  how SB 51 was the greatest football game ever played in the history of the sport another day, because we all know it was.  Chilis was an idea I brewed up when I though about all the cleaning and other prep i needed to do for the super bowl. It worked out even more so when my plans abruptly changed and we were supposed to attend another party rather than have one our own,. but arrive a little earlier.  Not to fear - I had ordered a Tray of wings, Mac n cheese, salsa, chips , guacamole and a salad with grilled chicken, all sized for a crowd and all ready to go for 5pm - perfect time to scoop the goods and get to the game. Only thing i thought was weird when I did an online check out was that it didn't require you to pay for it until you arrived to pick it up. The only exception was for same day orders. I ordered on Wednesday prior to the game.  We huddled up, dressed in our Pats gear and pull up front. This is where the only other star comes in. The hostess was so so sweet it was like she was waiting for us to walk in , notified us we could have come around the side to a designated entrance for Curbside pick up and that she would let the kitchen know we were here for an order.  That was cool. I moved my car and we walked in to be greeted by a young gentleman , but didn't see anything ready to go on the more than ample counter space.  I looked at my watch - ok we are about 5 mins early - lets give them a few.  About 10 mins goes by and he comes back out - empty handed - "" They are putting the finishing touches on that now! I'll take your payment when ready""  So I pay finally.  He rushes off back to the kitchen ... and there's only a tiny partition wall separating the waiting area from the kitchen so we heard everything they were saying.  Didn't sound like they had even started that food. ... or assembled something as simple as putting chips into a large container or guacamole. We can hear them literally shuffling things around and rushed openings of paper bags. I'm officially annoyed but hopefully they are just bagging up stuff right? WRONG He comes back out another 10 mins later with 2 large bags and sets them on the counter. ok now its 5:20... and .?? He goes back into the kitchen and says to someone - Whats up with that mac?   Someone responded to what he said and I couldn't make out what it was but then he said "" THROW IT IN THE MICROWAVE!""   Umm ok.  Well there's the sense of urgency. Meantime i'm pacing while trying to be polite and not lose my cool, he comes back out again, removes the two bags and says  - ""sorry they made the wrong mac n cheese! they are making another one now , it takes less time to make this one so you should be ok"".  Without a second more to process this I wanted to say - I'll take whatever's ready man, ! but he ran away too fast for me to even open my mouth. I would have accepted dry noodles at this point. So then an additional 10 mins passes in which time i got SO mad because another employee in plain clothes walked in, went to the kitchen and collected HER pick up order, which had to have come first , since she ordered hers 40 mins ago and I ordered mine 4 days ago... yup makes perfect sense... THEN a cook leaves for his car and takes a quick smoke break before coming back to through the same freaking door we are standing by.  What in the entire F is going on? not hard to see that the nearly empty restaurant and preoccupied staff were hand in hand. Why the hell am I waiting for something I ordered 4 days ago and the place is overstaffed and completely dead inside?  Pissed wasn't the word. Somehow my bf was more upset than I was so when a manager came out to tell us it would be one more minute and got my name wrong ( and I mean butchered my name)  He blasted her with everything I just described. She came back and politely gave use $20 in gift certificates. I Thanked her as she was trying to make conversation about the game etc. but it was just too late. we left almost 40 mins after we arrived and BARELY made it for kick off.  Super disappointed , really sad and the food was good except they gave us SPAGHETTI SAUCE INSTEAD OF SALSA..  UGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BYE CHILIS",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-leominster-4,,,,,

10,Paige A.,"West Palm Beach, FL",0,8,9.0,3.0,2017-05-14,I love Chilis but the consistency varies from date to date. I had one instance where the waitress hit on my boyfriend. That was a great time!  I love the margaritas and I love the chips and salsa. The food often varies and I try not to stray far from what I know I like.  The flat breads are delicious along with the table side guacamole and cheesy fries but anything fried and layered with cheese is good! Everything else is okay. My favorite margarita is the strawberry patron marg! That is one thing that is always tasty and makes me go back. Otherwise I probably wouldn't.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-leominster-4,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28
