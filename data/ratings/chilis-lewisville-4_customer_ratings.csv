When it came time to pay, it would not work on their scanner. After waiting at least 15 minutes for a manager to remove it from our ticket, he finally came to our table and, amazingly, suggested that I might be trying to double use a coupon.

27,Sasha F.,"Plano, TX",17,23,7.0,2.0,2015-12-23,First impressions are key in the service industry. It took our waitress over 5 minutes to arrive at our table. Then once she arrived she didn't even greet us - she simply asked if we would like anything to drink and then proceeded to rush us to place our order. It's been over 10 minutes and our guacamole still hasn't arrived. I know they aren't making a whole new batch just for our table so what in the world is taking so long!?! So our food came out but they forgot our appetizer. Our drinks were also empty several times without anyone offering to refill them.  Overall I'd say it was a bad experience and I doubt we will return.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lewisville-4?start=20,2.7280000000000006,2.7280000000000006,2.7280000000000006,2.7280000000000006,2.728000000000001

47,Cathy P.,"Dallas, TX",3,5,1.0,3.0,2016-01-08,"Visit 1)  we ordered food to go:buffalo chicken ranch and a burger.  My husband does not eat any dairy and he specifically told them NO cheese.  When he got the burger home it had cheese.  We called and they sent us a gift card in the mail which was nice, but I had to get up and make him something to eat which was annoying and the reason we opted to go to Chilis in the first place. Visit 2) food to go again: chicken crispers (my husband ordered this time as it is real hard to mess that up, right!) I ordered a quesadilla explosion salad.  My salad came with no dressing.  If you have ever ordered the quesadilla explosion salad you would know that the dressing is one of the best parts of the salad. There are two different signature ones that come with it that are full of calories, so you know it's good.  I tried to use some dressing that I had at home and it just wasn't the same, not even close.   Last time I send my husband to pick up a to go order.  You would think he would learn to check the order before he leaves after the first experience. You would also think they would put the signature dressing with a salad order... Visit 3) This time we actually ate in store. First off I love the decor.  Chilis has stepped it up and have really moved ahead with technology.  Our hostess and server were nice and attentive.  They have added some new drink options and because I have always loved their drinks I thought I would try some.  First I had the Tito's punch: decent enough, I drunk it super fast as it really tasted like punch without alcohol.  Usually I order one drink at dinner, but I ordered another because the first one went down so fast and I felt nothing.  The server suggested the strawberry  patron margarita.  I liked the presentation in the patron shaker but it was way too sweet, and I like sweet drinks.  I had to add lime to cut some of the sugar taste.  It was definitely stronger with the Patron, but tasted like strawberry purée and patron.  Way too sweet to enjoy.  I tried to have my husband finish it and he couldn't at all.  My waitress was very sweet and we didn't send it back or anything. I will stick with my old faithful. We ordered The two for $20 meal. Appetizer was fried pickles which were delicious! I had Dr Pepper barbecue ribs and my husband had original ribs. They were just OK nothing great and subpar compared to other Chili's Overall I think this location has great potential, but they have some work to do.  The food a drink is not what I'm use to from other locations.  Hopefully they get it together as I have always liked Chilis and was excited to have one closer than Frisco or Lewisville.

It quickly got crowded with some of my neighbors.  We sat at the bar where it was open seating, so no wait for us. I think we got there at around 6:45 so we caught the last part of happy hour. The happy hour options are ok on the food side, but the alcohol deals are pretty good I would say. Maybe $3 wells and domestic draft beers. For dinner, I got chicken fried steak, which used to be a staple on the menu, but is now a off menu item! It was delicious.

There's no better way to say than he's just the most unhospitable server I have ever had to deal with. He does not address you as a patron and simply asks you what you want. Then literally rolls his eyes at everything you say or request. I was a server for 5 years and this is the first bad review I have ever given someone. We had to order our appetizer twice, not a huge deal on its own but considering the rest... ot adds up. When the manager brought us our food, he asked us if we needed something to eat with since we had no silverware, and considering we ordered a burrito, the answer was yes.

It started with calling in my order, showing up 10 mins later and getting my food from the To Go area. Everything seemed to be going well, but that is where the good stopped. I opened my Togo box and presentation looked ok but as I grabbed the first French fry my initial senses should have triggered more red flags since the temp of the fry was off, I went to take a bite and my only guess is they were either trying to save some money or just not good at their job because as I took a bite I immediately stopped and and threw the fry back in the box recoilling back as all of my senses pieced together the horrific experience I just had....disgusting!! The fry was cold, tough, and tasted like it had been sitting on someone else's plate for three days! How is that possible that a professional restaurant that has chains all over the U.S. can't get one simple thing right? One simple cooking technique, put fry in hot oil, time, remove fry from hot oil...am I missing something? Is there some other way that I'm not tracking when it comes to cooking fries? Every fast food place does it, most sit down restaurant does it, why was it so hard for this place to cook one simple item the correct way and deliver an amazing meal. I didn't even try the rest of the food, if you can't even cook a fry right what makes you think you can cook ribs and pasta correctly, nope, I didn't want to have a bad night from eating crappy food.

However, I decided to stop by with my fam late Sunday night since this location just opened in TC. This one definitely boosted my opinion of Chili's back up. My sister ordered a 3 for $10 meal which is such a good deal; chips and salsa, a burger with fries, and a molten lava cake. I split a 2 for $20 meal with chips and quac, a shrimp fajita (didn't mind the extra charge to upgrade from chicken) and a Cajun chicken pasta. They have the best chips IMO and the salsa and quac were on point too. The great customer service moment happened when they made us steak fajitas instead of shrimp and let us keep the steak one while still bringing out the shrimp one later on AND not charging us extra. They were so nice about it, I was impressed. We had soooo much food, even without the extra fajita, and it was only around $30! The quality has definitely gone up and it doesn't take microwaved anymore, it tastes fresh! I def recommend the fajitas!

She is extremely efficient and makes sure all around her are working at their peak potential. She makes every customer feel like she sincerely cares about the service they are receiving from their server. She checks a couple times not just a courtesy check like most managers. She pitches in and works right alongside the servers and is not afraid to get in the mix. I see respect for her from the staff. I came from another location where the service had gone downhill to give Chili's another chance and Lisa has turned my feelings around 100%.  Nathan the server is the best they have and you should definitely ask for him. He is attentive, and knows the menu like the back of his hand. He is always in a good mood no matter how busy they are. He must have been hired by Lisa because he never fails to amaze me with his 5 star service. He never gets upset with special request for changes to the way something is prepared. He talks to the children in the party, he never makes you feel rushed to finish your meal on a busy night. He even helps out the newer servers while making his tables feel like they are the only table he is serving. Drinks are never empty and and the food is always served hot. He always thanks us for coming in and invites us to return. The way Lisa and Nathan treat the customers you would think they were the owners of Chili's not just employees.

23,Riley L.,"The Colony, TX",0,34,,4.0,2016-10-13,"Normally I wouldn't write about a Chilis, but this stood out to me so much yesterday I had to write. The first time I came to this location the food was great, and overall the server was nice, but a little slow. I remember hearing some stuff about this location, and how the service there is always slow, so I was hesitant about returning. My bf and I live close to the area, and wanted to give it a chance. We came on a Wednesday afternoon, and it was pretty dead. Our server who's name I forgot, but she was a black girl with short black hair, was really really nice!she was very attentive and friendly! She didn't try and up charge us, but gave us good recommendations on what we should get.         I ordered the prime rib tacos with the chimichurri. I knew ordering something like that, and with it being chilis, it was probably gonna be hit or miss, but it came out perfectly! The prime rib was some of the most tender I've had, and the combo of the sauce and the toppings were perfect. It had a kick, but nothing I couldn't handle! They let me switch out the sides which was nice of them too! Bf ordered the Cajun shrimp pasta! At other chilis locations, the Cajun pasta has a whiter more dull looking sauce, but this one just looked flavorful. Judging by the taste though it was definitely that! Plus they added a lot of the seasoning on it so that's good too! He loved it! The shrimp was also cooked perfectly!        Overall we will definitely be back, and really enjoyed our experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lewisville-4?start=20,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.544,3.1600000000000006

We figured one more shot. And I'm over the moon. McKenna was our server and she was absolutely awesome! Friendly, knowledgeable and understanding of my friends dining necessities. She was quick to check on us, for a packed Saturday our food was extremely timely and she was quick to make sure everything was good, without feeling like she was at our table every 5 minutes. And the food was great, I had the fried cheese curds(I forget what they are actually called on the menu) and they were great, and the prime rib burrito is amazing, I ended up taking 2/3s of it home but I'm really looking forward to eating it for dinner tomorrow!

This restaurant blew me away! The waitress introduced herself. She was up beat and positive the ENTIRE time. She checked on us a LOT. I'm vegetarian with weird food allergies and she picked up on it before I even had to spell it out! I didn't know the queso on the nachos had beef in it and she told them to leave it off.

It's hit or miss, but unfortunately mostly miss. Honestly, the food is pretty reliable. Good chips and guac and salsa. Good chicken fajitas. It's the service that is so unreliable at this location. We've been forgotten so many times... we're just DONE. It's weird, too. These aren't waitstaff who hate their job and just suck all around. They're typically nice and even professional. They just suck at their job. It feels like they have no coaching - no reliable training. Our last guy was nice, but he NEVER checked on us. We dealt more with the food runners than him. He never even checked to make sure our meals were okay. He was AWFUL. Not present. Talked to us when we arrived, once more at some point, and when we were getting up to leave (after paying on the Zoosk). Not. Present. We've had one home run server at this location, and that was about a year ago. All other visits have had varying degrees of bad service, from meh to awful. C'mon, Chili's. Train your people and keep coaching them. Other locations (Carrollton, Lewisville) have far more reliable service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lewisville-4,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004

The waiter couldn't give us a update. Finally we called a manager over giving everyone plenty of time to get our food out to us. But by that point we waited way long enough. So the manager came over, asked if he could help us and we told him how long we had been waiting and he told us everyone has been waiting that long and the food was almost ready. Wait a minute, I really don't need to hear I'm not the only one waiting on food. That's the best you can do or say? Then today I called to try and talk to the Day manager about what happened and I waited on the phone for ten mins, still no answer, it was 2:00 in the afternoon.

The entire process from ordering to food and drink delivery simply could not be more efficient. Our food was great as always. We did the two for 35 which includes app, two main course meals( we got half rack of ribs and Cajun chicken pasta) dessert and two presidente margaritas, all for 35 bucks which is a great value if you ask me!  The little kiosk at the table kept our toddler entertained with games and allows you to pay when you please.
