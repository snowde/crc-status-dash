10,Todd S.,"Tyler, TX",58,298,211.0,2.0,2013-06-18,"I like Chilis. It's usually safe and reliable. What I hate are the tiny ""small town"" locations. Always a long wait, and the bar here gets full and seats about 5 people.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lindale,,,,,
13,Kayla V.,"Mineola, TX",21,8,4.0,2.0,2013-09-21,I usually come here with family on Friday night's but tonight was horrible we called in a head of time to get quicker service the hostess said it would be a 25 min wait later we checked in 40mins later the hostess FORGOT about us! She actually said she forgot about us!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lindale,,,,,
11,Christiana S.,"Trinity, TX",0,7,,3.0,2014-08-31,The food was good I had to send my food back because there was hair in it. The manager was nice and comped my meal and promptly got me another plate.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lindale,,,,,
9,Patti L.,"Tyler, TX",0,4,,4.0,2015-09-08,"This particular location changed my mind about Chili's - the service here, from seating to settling the bill, was far superior to another of their locations in nearby Tyler and the manager is very pleasant and available if needed for the smallest thing.  The food was also well-prepared and delivered quickly.  We tend to arrive a little off-peak because they are a very busy location being so close to the interstate.  Not a big fan of the little electronic devices (prefer the personal service) but that was no problem for them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lindale,,,,,
8,Kiara M.,"San Diego, CA",8,14,10.0,5.0,2016-04-15,Thank you Katie Mac for the best service I have ever had. My family and I were having a horrible night and you turned it around with your fun personality! Awesome service! Awesome steak! Awesome Margaritas! Thank you for showing us Cali people some southern hospitality! I'd come back to Texas to eat at this chiles!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lindale,,,,,
7,Barbara K.,"Mineola, TX",22,2,1.0,3.0,2016-06-07,I can't believe some of the things they've removed from their menu.  Someone is not using their brains.  Ribs are still good though.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lindale,,,,,
4,Jerry L.,"Metairie, LA",4,70,28.0,4.0,2017-01-20,Chili's has always got a good menu and the food is good.  The staff at this particular Chili's is always very friendly.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lindale,,,,,
6,T M.,"Lindale, TX",0,6,,2.0,2017-05-03,"The quality of food AND the service is Hit or Miss.  Love Chilis but not this one!!  Slow service most of the time but not always.  I've had servers ask me to give them HIGH scores on the survey when they see I am using the kiosk at the table, I was appalled!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lindale,,,,,
2,Alicia M.,"Irving, TX",72,3,,2.0,2017-06-04,"I went there two nights in a row & both nights I got a grumpy waiter/waitress. Not very friendly & definitely not attentive.  Also, I only ordered guacamole & it came out brown as brown can get.  Pretty disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lindale,,,,,
5,Lori H.,"Chico, CA",1,71,99.0,5.0,2017-06-05,"The manager, Gary  and Cynthia, our waitress, go overboard. We had undercooked salmon and they worked overboard to make it right!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lindale,,,,,
0,Zarquala M.,"Tyler, TX",0,40,67.0,4.0,2017-08-11,Chilis is a staple in casual restaurants. Prices are steadily climbing and this may be due to economy or trying to stay profitable. A ribeye is almost $18. The food is a mixture of American and Mexican. The menu has changed over the years to include lots more items like tacos and enchiladas.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lindale,,,,,
3,Kay H.,"Granbury, TX",0,5,,5.0,2017-10-23,"We just did take out tonight, but Joshua took my order which was a little complicated. He deserves an at-a-boy. He asked specific questions about my order, checked the order before pickup and when I arrived rechecked every thing with me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lindale,,,,,
1,Scotti S.,"Lindale, TX",57,6,,2.0,2017-12-10,Food is always brought out wrong or cold. The wait staff tries but the kitchen staff hinders then. The hostesses are always young high school girls that are more concerned with talking and hanging out then greeting and actually getting people seated. We only go here for the drinks at the bar and maybe an appetizer,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lindale,,,,,
