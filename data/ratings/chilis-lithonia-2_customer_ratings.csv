25,Heather B.,"Lithonia, GA",0,2,,1.0,2014-06-04,"We came here on a quiet afternoon, thinking an hour would be plenty of time to get lunch. It wasn't. Despite there only being three occupied tables in the restaurant and at least four employees, service was abysmal. Our drinks, which took 20 minutes to come out, were never refilled. The food took almost an hour to come out, and it was incorrect.  We had brought a coupon for a free dessert. The manager, who knew we had to leave within seconds of finally getting our food, decided to offer the dessert without taking our coupon. The coupon that expired in two days. He seemed to think he was being gracious comping us our all ready free dessert. The dessert actually ended up missing half of its components, but by that point, we had no time to correct it.  The only good thing I can say about this location is that they have tabletop devices that allow you to see your bill and pay immediately. I shudder to think of how long we would have been there if we had to request the check.  There are good Chili's out there, but this is not one of them.

I have never experience such terrible services from a Chili's before in my life, whether it's the hour-long wait outside, plus another half hour waiting in the doorway, to the hour long delay in receiving our food. Not to mention the food was at best lukewarm and if not outright cold.  Manager did give our party a 50% discount but as a manager he shouldn't have to be so reactive, he should have been proactive given that this was not only a Sunday but Father's Day. He should have made sure he had enough staff to cover a busy holiday.

44,Robert C.,"Snellville, GA",36,9,25.0,1.0,2016-07-04,"We picked up our friends from the airport after a flight and they wanted to eat before going back to our house. We stopped at this Chili's because it was convenient to where we got off the Interstate and my friend wanted their Veggie Burger. There was chaos in sitting people which was our first hint of trouble. Once we were seated at a table it took @ 20 minutes for a member of the staff to ask if we have been waited on. When we told him no, he took our order and brought out our drinks. Then it was at least 45 minutes before our food arrived. My friend remarked that he had never experienced service this poor in his life. I'm not sure who our server was meant to be. When we got our food, the young lady who brought it out made sure we had everything we needed and refilled our drinks. A few minutes later, she checked on us again to refill our drinks and to see if we needed anything else. My friend's Veggie Burger was a bit burnt but she ate it anyway as she hadn't eaten in a long time. My wife and my other friend got the cheese enchiladas and said they were pretty good. I got the chicken sandwich with bacon and swiss. The food was decent but not great. I was greatly disappointed in the poor service at this location. We were never told why we had to wait such a long time to get our order taken or why our food took so long to bring out. I am thankful for the young lady who took over our table once she brought out the food. She was very pleasant and attentive. When it came time to leave, I paid on the tabletop device but I went back to the Chili's To Go counter to find her and give her the tip. She earned it as she was the only staff member genuinely interested in the quality of our visit. So to recap, just a poor job of seating people when we arrived; not having a server come to our table for 20 minutes to take our order; taking 45 (or more) minutes to bring out our food. That's just not acceptable in the highly competitive dine-in restaurant business. You can walk out of this Chili's and see a Smokey Bones Bar & Firegrill, a TGIFriday's, an Applebee's and an Arizona's. We'll give them a try before returning to this Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lithonia-2?start=20,1.72,1.72,1.72,1.252,1.7200000000000002

[if you're short staffed how about splitting the tables instead of doubling down?] He takes our drink and appetizer order, they were out of queso, most of the liquors, mashed potatoes, nacho chips and broccoli [WTF? We should've left then]. So we order accordingly. The guy takes the order, but the girl brings back the drinks, and they were ALL WRONG. How, just how, Why was one Arnold Palmer ordered, but 4 delivered? smh and then later on found out that my mom was charged 2.59 for a glass of water. [Lawd] We get the food, and I kid you not, something was wrong with E.V.E.R.Y.T.H.I.N.G! Everything! I send back my daughters chicken fingers because they were still cold to touch on the inside and the batter was wet. The waitress comes back with the manager, and he tells me that I ordered a certain kind of fingers, that's why they were like that [lol exactly what I was thinking] so I tell him that they were cold in the inside and the batter was still wet, he turns and says oh she didn't tell me that. Ok  Long story short, meal sucked, service was HORRIBLE, we came in around 7:30, didn't begin eating til after 10, and they couldn't get the receipt to print so they wanted us to use the little kiosk on the table, but get this... they couldn't find the one for our table! Let me just tell you, Chili's has always been one of my favorite places to just go to when I don't feel like cooking, but I can promise you that I will NEVER, EVER go back to this location. If you're smart, you'll stay the heck away as well!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lithonia-2?start=20,1.4,1.4,1.4,,1.4
36,Ebony A.,"Atlanta, GA",103,1,,1.0,2017-03-03,The worst!!!! The host was unpleasant. It took about 15 minutes for someone to greet us and another 20 for a glass of water.

6,Sakinah R.,"Atlanta, GA",1,3,8.0,1.0,2017-03-07,"Trust, that 1 star is by force not choice.  My boyfriend and I randomly decided to have Chili's one night. It was a week night and though we try not to eat out during the week for some dumb reason we agreed that Chili's would be a good idea. WRONG! We chose to order online & pick up. He ordered the quesadilla & a side of loaded mashed potatoes & I ordered the mix-n-match fajitas with grilled chicken & prime rib (tuh!).  We arrived at the restaurant a few minutes after our order was supposed to be ready but in actuality we were early because, surprise surprise, our order was not ready. After about 20-25 minutes my boyfriend finally emerges from the restaurant, food in tow, with an unpleasant look on his face. Apparently, they were out of mashed potatoes but had no problem attempting to charge him for them until he realized they weren't in the bag... ""oooh we're out of mashed potatoes...the bartender was supposed to tell you"" (side note: they were understaffed & the designated To-Go area was closed. So you had to pickup your food from the bar & pay with one of the servers ) Shady, shady, shady.  So we finally get home & I open my plate, starving, & ready to dig in & I was pissed! I basically had raw onion & bell pepper fajitas with a side of chicken & steak. It was an ENTIRE onion & about 3 strips of bell pepper that were completely uncooked... COLD & RAW. The chicken was white & had half a shake of seasoning on it...and the 5 chunks of ""prime rib"" were the only edible part of this onion fiasco.  I rarely complain but this was ridiculous, so I had to call & speak to the restaurant manager. After being told the manager was ""too busy"" & waiting about 10 minutes, he finally comes to the phone. I will admit he was very apologetic & offered to send me comp gift cards for my terrible experience.  So I get home today and find an envelope from Chili's in my mailbox (it's been about a week since the onion fajita showdown). And to my dismay there were 2 measly $5 gift cards inside. $10?!?! That's it?!?! Those disgusting, joke of a fajitas were over $15! That right there was the icing on the cake. Not only will I NEVER give the Chili's at Stonecrest my business again but I very seriously doubt I'll ever patronage another Chili's period. Needless to say I won't be needing those gift cards... I put them back in the mailbox in an envelope that says ""Happy Birthday""... hopefully, my mail lady's birthday is coming up soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lithonia-2,1.4,1.4,1.4,,1.4
19,Jessi F.,"Cleveland, GA",11,22,4.0,1.0,2017-03-10,Awful awful awful. I would give 0 stars if I could. My date and I were sat for upwards of 15 minutes without so much as passing glance from our server. We watched them greet other tables that had came in behind us and we eventually couldn't be patient anymore. We left and went across the parking lot to TGI Friday's and enjoyed the amazing service there instead.

17,Annie R.,"Doctor Phillips, FL",10,54,4.0,3.0,2017-04-05,"The food was good but the service was very poor. The restaurant was almost empty and our waitress never came out to see how we were doing or to refill our drinks. Another problem my brother complained about was the fact that the Smokehouse combo is a meal advertised on TV and pictured on their menu with baby back ribs and we ordered our combos but we're never told that there was a $2.00 up charge when you include ribs on your plate. Yes, in small print the menu says add $2.00 but the waitress must have known there is a problem because she comped our ice tea before she brought our bill and we noticed the up charge. The combo is not worth it if you order the Smokehouse Combo with baby back ribs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lithonia-2,1.32,1.32,1.32,,1.32

Finally got seated and the waitress acted like she didn't know what was going on kinda clueless about questions I had about the menu. Then the bartender had a bad attitude. I ordered a steak it was TOUGH. i had to drink water to swallow the steak down. Brocolli was also overcooked. Then we got another waitress she was good. Its just she had 12 tables to do alone cause another waitress had to leave. She literally was about to cry when I asked for a manager.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lithonia-2,1.32,1.32,1.32,,1.32

38,April R.,"Tucker, GA",0,1,,1.0,2017-06-11,"This is our second visit to this chilis. Had I remembered our first visit I would've not gone in this time. There are never enough servers, although today it seemed as though there might be. Took 15 minutes to get a drink order. Only 5 tables in section. 2 of which were empty. Server seemed uncomfortable serving. She couldn't handle the weight of the dishes, or how to properly put them in front of you. Took our order approx 30 min in. Dropped our order off and flew away. She never just stopped to ask how everything was, did you need anything, notice that our drinks were empty. Nothing.   Now onto food. I remembered my burrito from the previous visit was all rice, no chicken, so disappointing. This time I just got the triple dipper. Chicken fingers, southwest egg rolls and fried pickles. The pickles and egg rolls were decent. I bit into chicken and it didn't let me chew. I thought I must've gotten a tendon piece. So I tried another piece. I'm pretty sure this chicken was a rubber chicken toy, breaded and thrown in a fryer. It was inedible. Couldn't find the server to let her know. Finally flagged down the hostess who found our waitress. Waitress just came back after I was already done with the rest of my food. Didn't apologize. Didn't ask how she could fix it. Just said ok and came back 15 min later with addtl egg rolls. Meanwhile our drinks have been empty for 20 minutes. Our plates are empty and we're just ready to be done with this experience.  Do not go here. Once perhaps an anomaly. Second time, something is up. As a former server, I get how things can get hectic, overwhelming, and hard to handle. But this staff seems clueless what serving entails. What managing a restaurant actually requires. It's quite unfortunate and bizarre that a chain corporation has allowed this to go on. There needs to be an overhaul of management. An re-training of wait staff and of cooks and recipes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lithonia-2?start=20,1.4,1.4,1.4,,1.4

Such as the corn on the cob was shriveled up and bland. The endless chooser paid for we got one order brought to us and never refilled the drinks got refilled twice for us all and the food after we order the kids meals it took them 20 min to come back and say by the way we are out of Mac and cheese for he kids meals why so long. We also ordered loaded boneless wings very dry and nothing on them and then took another 30 min to get our check and another 30 just to pay this is worst chilis ever stay away.
