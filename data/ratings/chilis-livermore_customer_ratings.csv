113,Edmundo R.,"Tracy, CA",12,7,,1.0,2012-01-02,"Besides a few good laughs between my sister and I about the horrible meal/service I recieved at this Chilies, I was really turned off about the whole experience. Food: I had the Chicken Fajitas. When the server brought out the pan I was taken back at how hot and unprepared the whole meal was. I joked with my sister while I was literally stiring the food while it was still cooking. I was doing so for not for a minute, but somewhere between 3-5! I couldn't believe it! It was a decent meal but in a way I felt that I deserved a discount for partcipating in the cooking process!! Service: The waiter was very poor blaming staff for his performance. We had huge gaps with no service and he appeared very annoyed and unhappy working there. I would definitly not waste my time or cash at this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-livermore?start=100,2.88,2.88,2.88,2.5000000000000004,2.88

He went back to check, said they weren't, but that they were going to change the oil and fry up a new batch (it was early- 11:30, so they had the time to do this).  I loved the thoughtfulness of the server and the cook and I savored those fresh chips... YUM!   The next time I came in for lunch I asked the same question, but this time I wasn't as lucky. However, the manager did come over and explain how the fryer worked and when they changed the oil, etc.  He was very knowledgeable about food allergies and cross-contamination and made me feel very secure in my meal choice.  His staff was also educated and that is very important to anyone with a food-related allergy/intolerance/disease.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-livermore?start=100,2.96,2.96,2.96,2.768,2.96

34,Paul G.,"Livermore, CA",20,373,174.0,3.0,2012-05-01,"Recently remodeled store, though the exterior color scheme now vaguely resembles BJs, which oddly enough, is due to open a few miles up 580 near the new Target at Fallon Road.  Anyway. Not a fan.  A number of the walls are down, and the rows of booths parallel to the kitchen on the right (as you walk in) are now open tables ""floating"" in the center of the floor.  Which is fine, but I feel somewhat like an animal at the zoo in such settings.  They still have some booths, but apparently a party of five (not to be confused with Party of Five) are often relegated to this area.   Can't hate the player for the decor, but the service wasn't super-duper, either. Three of us were here and ready to graze on some chips and salsa (graze, geez... another zoo implication) with a tasty beverage, but the server didn't appear until the other two folks arrived.  Refills weren't too speedy either, and not like I was downing my soda with the same fervor of a few years back (our table decided to test a Planet Hollywood's ""unlimited refills"" speed... 45 second to 1:15, by the by -- impressive). Here, less impressive.  Finally surrendered and ended up drinking the last of a clear, non-carbonated, non-flavored complimentary beverage I stole from another at our table.  Met the need, but wasn't nearly as satisfying.   All told... *now* I remember why Chili's isn't part of my regular dining out line card.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-livermore?start=40,3.04,3.04,3.04,2.508,3.0400000000000005

59,Angie R.,"San Francisco, CA",276,142,18.0,1.0,2012-05-23,My husband and I decided to grab dinner at Chili's Grill & Bar last night. We were there early and were seated right away.  We decided to order from the $20 Dinner For Two menu. For our appetizer we shared a Crispy Onion & Jalapeno Stack. I was not impressed. The crispy onions were greasy and not as spicy as I would have liked. We were then brought the Chicken Fajitas and Cajun Chicken Pasta we had ordered. Once again the food was mediocre. My pasta was very bland and lacking in spice and so were my husbands fajitas.  We were pretty full by this point but decided to order dessert since we had a coupon for a FREE dessert of our choice. We ordered a Molten Chocolate Cake. It was delicious and probably the best part of the meal until I bit into a small white piece of plastic. I am not sure how that even got into the dessert but it did. I am so glad I didn't swallow or chip a tooth on it.  I would have brought this to the managers attention but didn't since my husband just wanted to relax after a long hard day at work.

Me: No, thank you. Hostess: It's happy hour! Me: No, just a regular table.

I just wanted to voice my extreme disappointment in the new layout of my local restaurant... A TV in EVERY corner throughout the entire restaurant??  Chilis used to be our favorite family destination, but we can't have a family meal together when everyone's eyes are drawn to a screen.  It used to be you could go out to get AWAY from those things, now we are bombarded with it. I was with my 6 year old son and 3 year old daughter and there was an informercial on with women in tiny bikinis, and the ads on the sports channels are all beer and girls.   Things I don't want my kids influenced by.  And I can't imagine any woman wanting to have a meal with her man while girls are working out on the TV - awkward and inappropriate. Please reconsider turning Chilis back into a restaurant instead of the 100% sports bar it's become.  We will not be back at this point.

Over the past month, however, there has been a noticeable decline in the quality of food. It is just one step above fast food and over priced for that standard. Today, for example, I ordered chicken nachos. I am more impressed with  what I could have gotten at Taco Bell! They were served lukewarm, with burnt cheese, and no chicken. I passed on adding guacamole after seeing it go by on another plate, looking grey. I would be hard pressed to say the food was mediocre.

The server came back only ten minutes after we got our food with the check and said ""no rush but I'll just leave this here for you"".

46,Staci S.,"Livermore, CA",46,11,2.0,1.0,2013-02-24,"I used to be a huge fan of Chili's and we used to go all the time.  About a year ago, my husband daughter and I went one weekend, and I got sick.  I figured it was just the flu but the following week we went back and my daughter got sick so it took us a year to venture back in. Last night was the first night that we ventured back in.  The only reason they are getting one star is because I do like the new decor.  Other than that, it was a horrible experience. First of all, the service is horrible.  Our server was Leslie.  She could not get rid of us soon enough.  Every time she came by she seemed very rushed and it was not even that busy.  Trust me, there were plenty of open tables and she spent plenty of time in the corner.  She brought us our dinner and then as soon as she cleared our plates, she brought us our check. She didn't bother to ask if we wanted anything else or if we wanted dessert. My husband and I both ate light so we could have dessert.   Second, the food looks horrible and was luke warm.  My husband had some buffalo wings and a side salad.  Some of his lettuce was wilted, his wings were thrown on a plate, and his ranch dressing was hot rather than cold.  I ordered the crispy chicken tacos, with no rice or beans.  The tacos came out cold but had clearly been sitting their for a while because the cheese had melted.  These tacos used to come in a rack, now the tortillas are thrown on a plate and all of the stuff is just thrown on top.  My daughters Mac & Cheese and cord were cold and looked old.  I didn't send anything back because Leslie looked irritated already and I didn't feel like wondering what would happen to my food if I sent it back.  As it is, she took a very long time at the cash register in the corner, so I am beginning to wonder if I am going to have some extra charges on my credit card. I must say sorry to the poor hostess who was probably all of 17 years old.  She asked us how our dinner was and I told her it would have been better if I would have even been offered some dessert.  I am pretty sure she was expecting me to say that everything was great but don't ask me a question if you don't want the real answer. Here are my suggestions: 1.  Get rid of Leslie.  She is going to drive your customers away. 2.  If Michael is still a bartender, have him give your waiters some tips.  You should have kept him as a waiter.  He is by far the best waiter that Chili's has ever had.  He is one of the reasons that we went back week after week in the past. 3.  Get your chefs to go back to culinary school.  Have them focus on presentation.  When the food looks bad, it makes the taste even worse. 4.  Have a manager at the front or someone who can handle complaints when people are asked how their meal was.  That poor girl that was there last night had no idea what to do or say to me.  What would have been nice is if she asked if I wanted to talk to an manager. Other than that, all I can say is good luck.  If more people experience what we experienced last night, you will be with Chevy's....out of business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-livermore?start=60,2.88,2.88,2.88,2.116,2.88

84,Rachel S.,"Pleasanton, CA",757,549,286.0,4.0,2013-06-29,"I frequent this Chili's quite often with my daughters and/or my friend. We come for both, lunch and dinner. For the most part, they are really consistent, food and service wise. There's only been one time when I've had a so-so waitress. She was just a little...blah, for my liking. But other than that, the food has always been good. They've always taken really good care of us. Even when it's busy, the wait to get a table usually isn't that long.  I've sat in the bar one time with my daughters, since it is open seating. I liked our waitress, but it seemed to take longer for everything to happen. Maybe because there was only one waitress in that area and it was busy that night. I probably wouldn't sit in the bar again, with my kids. Maybe fine with a group of friends.  We always seem to order the same thing: chips and salsa. I order the original chicken crispers with double order of fries with ranch. One of my daughters orders the chicken crispers with fries, the other a hamburger with fries and the third one, grilled chicken breast with oranges. They always talk me into getting a molten lava cake too...although they usually don't have to do too much convincing.  Chili's usually sends out good coupons for the weekdays. If you come here often, I'd suggest getting on their e-mail list. The only thing that was weird the last couple of times that we went here was with the molten lava cake. The first time my daughters and I ate one, it tasted like they had put pepper in the mix. I smelled it when she put the plate down. The entire thing didn't taste of it, just one side of it. I thought it was my imagination. Then when I went there again with my friend and my daughters, I smelled it again. My friend said she didn't smell it until she took a bite of it and said that it tasted like pepper. So weird. The place that they're storing them or where they're making them or something...it's somehow getting pepper on it. Not really that good...

Walked in at about 5pm, restaurant is generally empty. No hostess in sight. Lots of staff walking nearby and completely ignoring us. I finally yelled to one of them to be seated.  We get seated and our server was decently attentive and accommodating. He brought one set of silverware for 3 of us and a pile of napkins. I guess he figured my children would eat with their hands and thus need cleaning afterwards.  Napkins had blood, or what appeared to be blood on them. I pointed it out to the manager and the waiter did not take away the other napkins in the pile. He did, however bring me another napkin with blood on it....From the same bin. Manager ""investigates"" and determines that it's not blood but rather a watermelon sauce. I'm not convinced, nor am I impressed. I am a nurse so I feel fairly confident in recognizing blood.

77,Ann S.,"Livermore, CA",0,3,,1.0,2016-09-18,"I used to come to this Chilis every now and then. The food was alright and the service was always good. Up until my last visit I had went with my boyfriend for dinner and that was the last time I ever came back to any Chilis ever. I had ordered the Chicken Crispers plate. The corn was over seasoned, it was SUPER salty. The chicken was a little soggy but I figured it was just the tempura batter they fry it in. I realized there was also something in my water so I had told our waiter. She was super apologetic and her service was superb, so I figured it wasn't really a big deal to complain about the food cus I was whatever about it all. And my boyfriend decided to order a side because he felt bad about my food turning out the way it did. So he ordered some of the Mac and Cheese with the jalapeños in it. And of course I wasn't fond of it either. Everything in it was just overpowering and I was pretty over it at that point.  Later on, I had woke up in the middle of the night with food poisoning. It was the worst thing ever and I was deciding whether I should call them the next day to let them know but how do you handle those situations? I can't really prove their food was exactly what gave me poisoning but I'm pretty sure that's what it was. It took me about 2 days to recover from it and ever since I stayed far away from Chilis.  The service here is great but the food is just alright. I guess I just got unlucky that night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-livermore?start=20,3.08,2.88,2.88,1.988,2.9600000000000004

75,Alicia B.,"Livermore, CA",0,16,7.0,1.0,2016-12-17,"Chilis in general has always just been ""okay"", and the Livermore location is no exception. But after my latest to go order I won't be back. First of all it wasn't ready or even started to be put together at the time it was supposed to be; I even arrived slightly late and the staff seemed to have no idea what I was there for. They weren't friendly at all btw, making me feel like I was in the way just for picking up something I paid (and tipped) for.  I finally got my order and got home and the first issue there was that all of the food was cold. Mind you I live nearby so that wasn't the problem and I've had hot food from them before. It seemed like it had been just sitting out which makes me wonder how my order wasn't ready. They forgot part of my order that I also paid for. But the biggest issue was that AS I was eating my salad I found a 5 or 6 inch long black curly hair that unfortunately I found because it was in my mouth already. So disgusting. I work in food service and this would be unacceptable at my place.  Overall though the biggest issue is that when I called my call for a manager was left on hold. I emailed corporate and two days later I haven't heard a thing. I paid nearly $50 for in inedible meal and didn't have time to drive back. The least they could have done was to acknowledge my issues but they didn't even do that.

We sat down and we're not greeted for at least 12 minutes. No one would have said anything to us unless I flagged someone down. The food (burgers and wings) took a LONG time to come out. Our drinks were empty most of the time. The southwest eggs rolls are one of our favorites at home, but they looked and tasted very different here. The burgers were okay.

Never fails to satisfy me. It's so simple.  My wife is pregnant so she can't drink, but when she wasn't we loved experimenting with all the different fun mixed drinks Chili's has. She loved the watermelon cooler. I like the presidente margaritas. When our kid finally comes we are totally looking forward to this being our family night out restaurant.

But to my surprise not only were we charged for everything, the manager never came out to apologize or at the very least check-in with us.  While I do understand mistakes and issues happen, I do not get the ignoring of those issues or lack of customer service.  So unfortunately those actions have caused this negative review (and I found out that this seems to be a common experience) and more then likely the Livermore chili's has lost two more customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-livermore?start=20,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92

19,Sherry P.,"Patterson, CA",2,52,47.0,1.0,2017-03-08,"This was an unusual late dinner after work. Even more unusual that we chose Chili's since we've never been big fans but it was here or Denny's. I think we made the wrong choice. We sat in the bar. The atmosphere is kinda cool though the TV's were quite loud. Our server Brayan was attentive and polite. Now for the critique- My Caribbean salad had only 3 pieces of pineapple and those had bits of peel and hadn't been cored (uneatable), the cranberries and raisins were dried out(old), the lettuce wasn't even real cold. On the plus side there was plenty of shrimp. But be forewarned- the ""Honey-Lime"" dressing doesn't taste like either but it does taste like mustard, -the Balsamic dressing tastes like someone mixed Honey-Lime with a shot of vinegar, yuk. I love big, bold flavors but chewing on warm mustard seeds doesn't qualify. $11.89 and I ate 1/3 of it. Hubby's Prime Rib Tacos were equally disappointing. The meat was less like prime rib and more like pot roast slathered in some kind of fake ""grilling sauce"", VERY little avocado, black beans were room temp and didn't get eaten. Then, on my way to the bathroom I walked all the way through the mostly empty restaurant and saw food scraps under every table. One gal was sweeping (kinda) and the others were....? Needless to say I won't be back. At least at Denny's I know what to expect --like kitchen help that doesn't know how to properly cut up a pineapple but at least they know which foods are supposed to be hot and which are supposed to be cold. By reading all these reviews it's really surprising they are still around. The management reads these and must not really care that they are on the same path as Applebee's as nothing is changing. Fine by us, we'll wait for another hot spot to take their place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-livermore,2.72,2.91,2.91,,2.8340000000000005
5,Jennafer C.,"Danville, CA",62,16,2.0,1.0,2017-03-23,"I have always been a fan of Chili's! Well not anymore!  My first crummy encounter was a to-go order. I waited at their to-go counter for almost 10 minutes before someone offered to help. I got the smothered smoked chicken burrito and it was horrible. There was no sauce and was the driest thing I have ever had. I specifically asked for no sour cream and apparently that meant give extra sour cream and no burrito sauce! I also asked for the side to be rice, again not included. Being that it was to-go there wasn't anything I could do. I played it off as a bad visit.  I decided to return with my company. We were seated promptly and already I thought it was going to be great. We waited for 20 minutes before someone wanted to claim our table. Now, there was a party of six who sat directly in front of our table about 10 minutes after we sat down and not only were they greeted, they had their drinks and their food ordered before we even were greeted. Again our food was far from spectacular with sides missing and never a check in to see how we were or even drink refill.  Well why would I go back? Ugh, because I thought MAYBE it was just the holidays and the service/food was rushed. Today I again ordered online. Food was ok but I opted out of eating it and donated it to the dumpster after what I witnessed. I walked in the to-go door and waited in puddles of water as there seems to be some sort of leak. Standing water attracts bugs and other things! As I stood there waiting to be acknowledged.. AGAIN, I witnessed a server walk up to the food, touch the food with her bare hands JUST AFTER SHE WAS TOUCHING HER HAIR. She proceeded to lift up the hamburgers and go through the condiments. I witnessed this on 2 orders. She then asked where ""Luke"" was but with other choice words. I was disgusted. I threw my food away and I will never come back. All three visits were at this location. Maybe one day I will venture into another location but never this one! Chili's corporate needs to address this location!

We asked why when we clearly received something different and she said she would ask the manager and have her change it. About 5 mins later the manager Shelly came over to our table. This was probably the worst experience I have ever had with a restaurant manager. She refused to change the price when we were never informed they would not be charging us anything different.
