15,Troy W.,"Louisville, KY",4,323,700.0,4.0,2012-03-28,"This chain is comparable to an Applebees, but the menu has a little more spice and flavor.  In addition, the decor/design has a little more ""spice and flavor"" as well. At this location, I have experienced great service and good food. Note:  I tried their Avocado Burger.  I ordered it medium rare (that was the first time I was ever asked how I wanted the meat cooked on a burger) and it was one of the best tasting burgers I've ever had. UPDATE:  I'm vegetarian now and I was afraid I would miss that great tasting Avocado Burger.  Well, it turns out, any ground beef burger can be replaced with a grilled, black bean burger.  I tried it and it was excellent. UPDATE:  On my last visit, they added little touch screens at each table where you can pull up your check, add a tip if you like, and then swipe your own plastic.  Love it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-louisville,,,,,
11,Cheryl S.,"Shepherdsville, KY",0,6,1.0,5.0,2014-05-02,This place has THE absolute BEST staff!! Second to none hands down!! The good is great and comes to the table hot and fast! I will be a loyal customer for life!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-louisville,,,,,
13,Richard F.,"Crestwood, KY",14,1553,3556.0,1.0,2014-05-31,"Just heard the announcement that Chili's will not allow people who carry to eat at their restaurant.  Well, if that's the case I will not eat there ever again.  What a stupid policy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-louisville,,,,,
14,Laura S.,"Louisville, KY",11,139,4.0,4.0,2014-07-15,"It may not be the absolute best tex-mex, but it's above decent and firmly into good. I've had several meals here, the thin tortilla chips are my favorites from a restaurant and the salsa and guacamole are very good starters. Favorites are the southwest egg rolls, flat breads, margarita chicken, fajitas, corn, and southwest Mac and cheese. I don't let myself have the lava cakes often, but they never disappoint. Service is never bad, food is always flavorful, this is an excellent place to get a quick bite.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-louisville,,,,,
7,Michael M.,"Joplin, MO",166,231,1580.0,3.0,2014-09-01,"Pretty good burgers, fun drinks, and interesting sodas (with the Coke machine) and always trying new things. I like Chili's generally but like a lot of chains they roll out really good items and then change them once the promo is over, often down grading quality. So I do like them when we are late getting home and they are pretty fast getting orders together. Sometimes they will bring the to-go order to the curb too so I do appreciate that when I'm tired or the weather is bad. My wife and I ate there today and there are little things I liked but also bugged me.  There are two versions of guacamole on the menu one is 3 bucks more than the other and the only difference is they make it at the table, and it has optional jalapenos.  Then there is the Coke machine, they have it, put together a fancy menu and over charge you for the access to the many options, only they require you to let them fill it limited you to what you can get or how often. It's not like they say no, but you have to know what you want, wait for a water and ask for the drink. It misses the whole point of the new Coke machine. I ordered a hamburger, the same one I always get. It used to come with thick sweet bacon. Now it's got paper thin bacon that is under cooked. So my point is there are some good items on the menu and if you order a new item in the first month it's often pretty good but once it moves to the regular menu they cheap it down. There is also a bit of ""me too"" going on. They seemed to have lost their direction and theme and are always copying what other chains are doing well. But they never execute it as well because it's just not what they are good at or passionate about. I wish the chain would get back to it's roots and do it well instead of trying to be like everyone else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-louisville,,,,,
17,Erin M.,"Louisville, KY",40,59,16.0,5.0,2014-10-08,Our waiter was the best. He kept the refills coming. I had the old-timer cheeseburger. It was delicious. Cooked perfectly. I enjoyed the digital trivia while we waited for our food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-louisville,,,,,
10,Simon I.,"Louisville, KY",8,9,,1.0,2015-07-08,"Chili's as a chain doesn't need more reviews, but I have to contribute this one for this particular location. This is the worst Chili's I've ever eaten at. It used to be brand-standard, but it has significantly declined in quality since it opened. When they introduced carry out service a couple of years ago, I was pretty excited, because most restaurants in this area do not offer that. I have ordered carryout from this location several times, and they have never once gotten my order exactly right. Everytime I have ordered from here, my order has been incomplete, either missing an item, or not prepared to my instruction. For example, I usually order beans with my burger, but they are often not included when I pick it up. I have also ordered a bean burger, but instead received a meat patty. I was also pretty excited when the brand introduced flatbread, but when I ordered one, it was entirely too greasy to eat. I ate half of the flatbread, but had to stop when I felt sick. This is a consistent problem with the flat bread at this location that I don't experience at other locations. Blotting doesn't help.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-louisville,,,,,
16,BeverleyAnne W.,"Louisville, KY",34,14,,2.0,2015-08-07,"To be fair I have been here twice before.  The first time was great.  Great server, fresh delicious food.  The second time everything was ""okay"".  The third time we came in at 815pm on a Wednesday night.  We got seated and sat there for several minutes waiting to be greeted.  This is typically a bad sign.  Servers were cleaning their stations and basically ignoring us and the other 2 tables that got seated.  Finally our server came.  She greeted us very friendly and took our drink order.  She brought them out to us quickly, took our food order and that came out quickly too.  That was the end of the service for the evening.  My order was incomplete and we needed refills but she never came back - not even once.  She did show up in the dining room a little bit later but that was only to sit down at a table and talk with a customer, or maybe it was her boyfriend.  We never got her attention, no one else came by and we never saw a manager.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-louisville,,,,,
12,Teresa C.,"Louisville, KY",0,4,,3.0,2015-09-11,Very unhappy with chili's for doing away with their potato skins.  They were very good so I don't understand why they would take them off the menu,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-louisville,,,,,

6,Alicia B.,"Louisville, KY",66,64,93.0,4.0,2016-07-15,"Date night dinner. We were seated quickly and our waiter, Jeremy, was the best waiter I've ever had anywhere.

2,Andrea E.,"Louisville, KY",98,234,787.0,4.0,2017-03-01,"Wow! I have never had a great experience here and today was fantastic! The food was great! I had the Santa Fe salad with grilled chicken. Our server, Maria exceeded our expectations with her awesome attitude and personal recommendations! The quesadilla was a hit as well as the Caribbean and Margherita flatbread salads. I'll be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-louisville,,,,,
8,Patricia G.,"Glen Ellyn, IL",0,8,,5.0,2017-04-08,"Taylor and Mike were AMAZING!  We had a group of 20 from Chicago visiting for a volleyball tournament and we couldn't have picked a better place.  From ordering to paying not one issue.  They were both enthusiastic and happy to be there, it was great!  Hope we can visit again next year.  Thanks guys!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-louisville,,,,,
4,Scott W.,"Louisville, KY",60,13,3.0,1.0,2017-05-27,"Chili's is a decent bar, and as a franchise I enjoy the food. However this location is terrible. It seems every time we try to give them a second chance, we end up disappointed. This latest visit was no different. We did curbside take out. Ordered chicken fingers two ways; given the wrong order. They were quick to correct the issue, so that is good.  But biting into one of the chicken fingers I found a bone. With my teeth and cheek. A bone in a boneless piece of chicken. Contacted management on Wednesday and have not heard back. Today is Saturday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-louisville,,,,,
5,Jeremy J.,"Mount Washington, KY",76,177,310.0,2.0,2017-06-10,This place just cost too much money for the food that you're getting the atmosphere is pretty crowded it does not have the best food for bar food in my opinion you can go to Hooters or roosters or something of that nature and get much better food for better prices I do not recommend,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-louisville,,,,,
1,Marcia V.,"Louisville, KY",109,615,287.0,4.0,2017-09-24,"Working out where I do, there are tons of fast food, and chain food joints. Most are generally ok, I was very pleased with this Chili's locations. When you have limited amount of time for lunch at work, they have their curbside pick up, but we wanted to sit in and not be at work for a while. WE were quickly seated and our waitress took our orders quickly. Being a Wisconsin girl, I was very happy that one at our table ordered the cheese curds and they were delicious. Their menu had changed since I had last been to a Chili's but I like that they offer a lunch menu (soup or salad and main dish). Our food came out fast, and our waitress made sure our drinks were always full, and cashed us out quickly when we had to get back to work. Nice place you got here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-louisville,,,,,
3,N B.,"Louisville, KY",0,12,,4.0,2017-11-18,This chili's is always crowded but they seat you fairly quick. Food is pretty good and they offer plenty of variety. Service is quick and prices are decent for a sit down restaurant.  Sometimes the waiters aren't that attentive but that could be because of staffing issues. Not really sure. Worth a shot.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-louisville,,,,,
0,Christopher S.,"Louisville, KY",202,565,1409.0,4.0,2017-11-27,"I am judging this on a scale of one to five for Chilis and this is a four star Chilis. It is near my home so when I want to eat but I don't have the emotional strength to cook and clean.   The food is the food.  It is what you expect Chilis food to be.  It's never wrong and it's never as good as home cooked food but the funny thing about ""home cooked"" is that it is also ""home cleaned.""   This would be a five star Chilis but everything takes so long.  So, so long.  It is never a quick place to eat.  For what it is, it takes too long.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-louisville,,,,,
