Stopped in because we wanted a drink before we went to Cracker Barrel (long story, no need to share why - other than they don't serve alchohol). Sat at the bar for 5 minutes (I was the only one at the bar) and was passed by the bartenders (there were 2) without a hello a couple of times. My GF sat down (yeah why was she in the bathroom for 5 minutes) and then they said hello?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-loveland?start=20,2.404,2.404,2.404,2.404,2.404

6,Marilyn G.,"Mesa, AZ",0,12,,5.0,2014-04-29,"Chili's is my favorite restaurant; I love the chicken crispers.  Although they do not open until 11:00am , I was able to call them at 9:00am this morning and ""Scott"" took my order over the phone for an 11:00am pickup.   He was very ""warm"" and helpful. My daughter is driving to Loveland from Denver to have lunch with me, her father and twin sister who only has an hour for lunch.  This is important because it is a 40th birthday celebration for the twins.  ""Scott"" took my payment information and said he would personally run the credit card himself, since I did not want to bother my daughter with this.  This ""over and above"" service is just one more reason that this is my favorite restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-loveland?start=20,2.836,2.836,2.836,2.836,2.8360000000000003
30,Stephanie G.,"Fort Collins, CO",17,37,15.0,1.0,2014-07-15,"After being seated my husband and I waited 15 minutes to be greeted by a server. It was Sunday afternoon about 1pm...busy but still should have at least gotten a water and a hello.Got the excuse that there are three servers in the ""end zone"" so they thought each other had gotten our table...what is the thing about ""assuming""?  Anyway, was mighty annoyed by the little touch screens they now have at each table. You can play games, pay your bill, and view the menu on them. Thought it was kinda funny how long we waited to get served and the fact they have these touch screens...perhaps they are trying to distract their customers so they don't notice the horrible service?  Didn't tip much as the server was delayed, and at the end didn't even take my bill...soon we will be serving our own drinks and submitting our own orders via touch screen...no more servers. The food was very salty as well. Husband and I both left feeling like crap. The flavored lemonades are not real food flavors ie. the watermelon lemonade is not real watermelon juice it's a flavoring and is super obvious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-loveland,2.404,2.404,2.404,2.404,2.404

10,Julia H.,"Fort Collins, CO",62,6,,2.0,2015-01-21,"Not worth the money. Our server brought us cold food, messed up our bill by over charging us, then was no where to be seen when we needed her to fix our bill. Chili's is disappointing. It's interesting that the same company who owns Maggiano's-which has awesome food and service for the same price-also owns Chili's which has crappy food and service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-loveland?start=20,,,,,

Our waitress was very attentive and helpful. My other co workers all enjoyed sandwiches and salads that went over well. Restaurant was clean and the restrooms clean as well, a huge deal for me. Clean restaurant and restrooms means good food. We will be back.

0,Nancy T.,"Fort Collins, CO",0,1,,1.0,2015-07-03,"Hadn't been to a Chili's recently but stopped in to share some fajitas last night with my husband and we were EXTREMELY disappointed! We were asked what we wanted for out double meat and when the skillet came, our ""double"" meat was a single chicken breast. The skillet was not sizzling, our waitress brought beans and rice with the skillet, received a tiered stack of approximately a tablespoon of about 8 different condiments...barely enough to make one fajita each...and no tortillas or plates until 10 minutes later. What happened to CHILI'S?? POOR service, ridiculously small proportions, POOR quality...lame, lame, LAME! We used to love Chili's!

26,Michelle C.,"Windsor, CO",0,9,,4.0,2016-05-07,"Stopped at Chili's in Loveland yesterday afternoon for an early dinner. Started with chips, salsa, & queso dip and a blueberry- pineapple Margarita. All very tasty, especially the 'Rita.  For dinner I had the shrimp & prime rib fajitas. Shrimp was a different alternative to chicken and the prime rib was ok, but I think the steak is more flavorful. My husband had the chili-mango talapia entree, which he enjoyed.  Chili's food is probably 3 stars. I gave 4 stars because our server, Melissa, was spot-on with service. She was friendly, served everything with a smile and checked back often enough to give us an overall nice dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-loveland,,,,,
1,Kelly H.,"Fort Collins, CO",0,13,2.0,5.0,2016-06-24,"I hadn't been to a chilis in years and was surprised to be so impressed overall. The bartender, Stephanie, was down to earth, knowledgable of the menu and attentive to our needs. She had a positive contagious attitude. I got the quesadilla explosion salad and added spicy sante fe sauce- it was fresh, delicious and filling. Because of the great food, atmosphere and great service by Stephanie... I will definitely be recommending this Chilis and returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-loveland?start=20,,,,,
21,Gary B.,"San Buenaventura (Ventura), CA",35,160,293.0,4.0,2016-07-23,"When I walked in I was starving!! I haven't been into a Chilli's in years and despite having many eating choices in this area I chose this restaurant.  Since I was alone, I decided to take a seat at the bar. On this day the bar was packed and as a result the person (at the bar), who functions as server and bartender, was super busy.  It took her a few mins to get me a drink but she more than made up for it by being friendly, smiling big and being engaging. She was a natural people person and I could see she was working her but off!  I ordered a sample plate which hit the spot! Also she refilled my water cup without asking; because of the altitude or something, I drank more water than usual. I left satisfied with energy to take to my next  customer!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-loveland,,,,,
27,Ashley R.,"Colorado Springs, CO",0,28,3.0,2.0,2016-09-07,"I must say, Chilis sure has gone down hill with the quality and amount of food they serve. I have for years ordered the half rack of ribs that comes with a side of fries. The past 3 times I've ordered this, the ribs barely have any meat on them. And the meat that is there, has the texture of beef jerky. Not the savory, fall off the bone ribs I like. And the French fries they serve are about 15 fries. It looks sad on the plate. What's up Chilis?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-loveland,,,,,
23,Brittani L.,"Johnstown, CO",3,7,,1.0,2016-11-29,This must have been an off night at chili's   usually the service and food is spot on  tonight our table was dirty upon arriving my drink was empty several times (pregnant  and really thirsty) then we ordered the shrimp for an add on someone in the kitchen needs some cooking tips they did way to much seasoning they messed my order up and brought the wrong order my  my husband had finished his meal and we were still waiting for my food.

17,Jenn M.,"Pueblo, CO",36,131,24.0,4.0,2017-05-12,"Another chain restaurant.  It's the same as every other Chili's in the world.  There is only one thing that truly determines a chain restaurant's quality, the service.  And the service here was excellent.  I was driving up from Aurora and my date was driving down from Cheyenne.  Special occasion; I don't usually drive that far for a first meet.  And here's the reason I don't:  Because I will be late.  I will get lost or there will be traffic or some such.  But whatever reason, I can expect to need more time than Google says.  But I was super late today.  There was an accident on the highway and what was supposed to be 48 minute drive became 75 minute drive.  So embarrassed.  But there my date was happily sitting with nachos and a drink, without a care in the world.  And after I sat down, the waiter was there, ready to take my drink order, with a big smile.  They serve Coke products, my personal favorite.  But I've never actually liked the food at Chili's.  I'm just really polite, so I went where my date suggested.  They had some new items on the menu, so I tried one of those.  The Chicken Crispers.  They were good.  Coated in a tempura batter, the chicken was juicy and not spicy.  I actually looked up the menu before I went, because I knew I didn't like the food there and I wanted to do my menu browsing before the date.  And kudos to Chili's for having their full menu online.  So, when the waiter brought my drink and asked if I needed more time, I was able to order right away.  It comes with fries and corn on the cob.  All of which were very yummy.  The waiter was on top of bringing fresh drinks.  And he didn't seem to mind that we sat there for two hours, chatting, on top of the 30 minutes my date waited for me.  He was very friendly and told us to take our time when he gave us the check.  They have these little computers on the tables and my date used it to pay.  I didn't get a chance to play with it because, you know, I was being polite.  But I bet it does other things besides let you pay,  If you want a good chain, fast casual restaurant in Loveland, this is a great place to go.  And the date went well, too.  So all in all, it was worth my drive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-loveland,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006
19,Dona B.,"Berthoud, CO",14,7,,1.0,2017-05-30,"We go to this Chili's quite often and have had great service. Today our waitress was rude. After taking our order my daughter handed her our menus. The waitress said, ""Oh, am I the menu taker, too? Here j7st take these menus."" Then it took over 30 minutes to get 3 bowls of Chicken Enchilada soup, a kids chicken finger with fries and mashed potatoes. We watched while other patrons who came in after us, get their food. It was a rotten experience today. We were there around noon and I believe we sat at table 43.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-loveland,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005
25,Lindsey E.,"Loveland, CO",20,3,,1.0,2017-06-01,Horrible service. Went to have lunch and everything was good when the initial drink order was taken but then just went south from there. When it came to taking our food orderb the waitress over 10 minutes  to even get or lunch order. Then when the waitress took our menus she had Made a snide remark! Then as we were sitting there waiting for our food it took well over a 1/2 hour if not longer to receive A kids chicken bite meal and 3 bowls of soup! As we sat there waiting for food people who have came in well after we did got their food served to them 1st. The waitress dropped off the food and never came back to ask if we needed anything or if everything was OK! Needless to say I will not be returning to that chiles as I would rather drive further to have better customer-service. What sets chiles apart from other chilis as being a chain restaurant is their customer-service! Needless to say they fell short. This restaurant has lost my business!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-loveland,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88
22,Barb F.,"Arvada, CO",0,1,,1.0,2017-08-13,"I'd give this chilis zero stars if I could. We were seated right away and that is when the service stopped. No one acknowledged us for for for the fifteen minutes we waited. At least three different wait staff kept walking back and forth past our table. They were not busy at all only two tables with people at them in this section. Not an I'll be right with you, no drink order nothing. It was as if we were deliberately ignored. They did, however, clean off tables around us even though no one was waiting for tables.  There was something wrong with the food at another table as we heard the waitress tell them there order would be free. We had a toddler with us so after the twenty minute wait for no one interested in us we left.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-loveland,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88

The food FINALLY came 45 minutes later...but not mine. The waitress had messed up my order. 15 minutes later, & after everyone else was done eating, my food came. It tasted like a frozen dinner. The waitress blamed it on the kitchen saying they were backed up....but that's impossible, because the place was only about half full. Chili's is not good anymore.
