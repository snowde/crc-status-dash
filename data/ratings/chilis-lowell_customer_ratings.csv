32,rich a.,"Andover, MA",0,4,,3.0,2012-01-02,"Hello, I wanted to write about the experience my group and i had this evening.  There are usually about 20 to 30 of us every Monday night and we have been loyal to this establishment for over 2 years, probably longer.  We were approached by a Manager??  towards the end of our night and were told that one of the bills was not paid,  and that if it was not paid, we would not be welcome back into the restaurant again..     Before I explain further, keep in mind that the servers seem to be overwhelmed at times. This is not to blame them, we come in late and are a little loud and confusing  as we move around and go out for cigarettes, ect. The servers do an excellent job. I believe the Management needs to know what is going on and also starting next week, we will be going to the Outback instead. We were not treated well by the manager on duty.  A good amount of us have restaurant experience, such as myself as a Manager for 3 years. Also we have cooks. chefs, waiters and waitresses in our party regularly. I believe this is discriminatory and offensive to the people who have been going there for years, such as myself. thank you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lowell?start=20,2.316,2.316,2.316,2.316,2.316
38,KY L.,"Boston, MA",0,4,,1.0,2012-06-06,"The Chili's at Lowell made me feel extremely DISAPPOINTED!! This is my first time to have this poor experience: M*k* was our waiter tonight, he was so rough.  Here were what I ordered tonight: app-Egg roll, potato skin, buffalo wings; main course: Caribbean salad, California sandwiches.  The total is $34.86, I got him $100 cash and he GIVE ME $60 CHANGE.  ($20+$10+$10+$5+$1X15)  POOR WAITER, POOR POTATO SKINS this time.  What did he mean? Why did he steal my $5.14 change? He didn't have this right and privilege to do that.   I told my previous waitress and waiter on facebook.  They said he was such a s****d guy at there, nobody like him. (Idk anything from there) But as a customer, I'm strongly not recommend he did that again.  THAT'S SO ROUGH FOR THE CUSTOMERS.  He should think about himself. What kind the attitude he had? such a loser!!         I always go to Chili's(like twice a month), and nobody would do it like that.  I always made friends with the staffs at any Chili's restaurants, because I like the food (especially the appetizers).  Each time, I will give them 20%-25% tips ONLY FOR CHILI'S, except this time.   I swear, I will not go to Lowell's Chili until this rough guy leaves.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lowell?start=20,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116

33,Jacqui C.,"Salem, MA",0,23,1.0,2.0,2012-08-13,"As chain restaurants go, I tend to like Chili's.  The food is usually good, the service is pretty quick, and if you go at the right time you can get fast service, good food, and it is a good experience.  Not this weekend!  We went on Saturday, around 3pm for a lunch/dinner.  We wanted to get in and out quickly and thanks to some bad service that did not happen. At 3pm it wasn't all that busy.  We didn't want to be in the bar so the hostess sat us in the dining room area, but an area with NO other patrons.  Not only were we the only ones in this area, we were sat behind a wall so that we couldn't even see the rest of the room.  This should have been our first clue.   As if fated, our waitress forgot about us often.  We put in a drink and appetizer order and quite some time later she showed back up and ran off, without our dinner order.  About 20 minutes later she stopped back, took our dinner order and promised to bring us refills.  She must have forgotten to put our dinner orders in because about 15 minutes later she showed up with our drink refills and no dinner.  Another 10 minutes went by and in came our dinners.  We were done with our drinks by the time they arrived.  No, my wife had asked for the additional avocado slices on her salad and when the salad arrived, after the waitress took off....no avocado slices. I asked for napkins as we had none....never got them.   Never got another drink refill.   The next time the waitress showed up it was about 10 minutes after we had finished our meals.  The hostess must have warned her because the waitress came flying around the corner, asking us if we wanted more to drink, if we were all set, if we wanted dessert, etc.  When we said no she magically produced a bill out of her pocket.  That she was ready for. We left quickly after that, as she was quite quick to respond to our desire to pay by credit card.  Well, if that was all she was after then she shouldn't have been surprised by our small tip.  Personally, my wife wanted to give her 5% because she was so pissed off.  I convinced her that 10% was fair, as I was feeling generous.  Overall, had the service been better it would have been a typical visit to Chili's, but I think next time we'll opt for Outback Steakhouse instead...at least we've never waited THAT long for our food. ****Update: Gave it one more shot last week and had the same horrible experience but this time the entire room was crowded and we were still being ignored.  Not making the same mistake again.  Shame on me for hoping they'd improve.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lowell?start=20,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003

6,Addie M.,"North Chelmsford, MA",114,221,107.0,1.0,2014-10-22,"This review is strictly on the machines that chili's now make the customers navigate.  Apparently, waiting tables will soon become obsolete. Because now, instead of a server being responsible for handling guest payments- the guests are now required to do it themselves. So when I'm finishing up my meal, on a busy evening, enjoying myself, I have to stop what I'M doing, to do what your wait staff is being TIPPED and paid to do? Where's my discount- since I'm making their job easier and doing their work? You're turning their job into just food running? If that's the case- pay them a decent 12-15 dollars an hour and wipe out the 2.63 plus poor tips. It's bad a enough they do all the dirty work for minimum wage. How dare a company think it's REASONABLE to have the guest do a restaurant staff members job. It takes away the personability and the fun in being served.  I was completely turned off when I went there with a friend last weekend. So disappointing and sort of embarrassing.

31,Leoss T.,"Lowell, MA",0,4,,4.0,2015-03-30,"A few weeks ago at this Chili of Lowell, I enjoyed a lonesome night and indulged myself in their ""Ancho Salmon"" as a simple dinner. A few moments later after I self seated myself in the bar area, a server named""James"" introduced himself as my server. Moments later after placing my order and have only requesting water with lime. Lemon came upon my water; this is acceptable because they're equivalently the same.Throughout my dinner I enjoyed the bustling conversations and joyful laughters of fellow guests; while engaging in bites of my Ancho Salmon, it was crisp to the taste; however the broccoli that was accompanied with the Ancho Salmon dish was somewhat bland and could of been better off, if boiled longer and or drizzled with some sort of sauce, and the rice pilaf was slightly undercooked; Rendering the supreme quality of this dish undeliverable.

This is not a supplemental meat for this sandwich, had this been a turkey club or southwest chicken sandwich with a bacon accent two pieces would be sufficient, but the prime ingredient in a BLT is BACON,so where the hell is it?
