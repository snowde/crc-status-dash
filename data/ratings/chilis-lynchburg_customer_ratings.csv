13,C.J. B.,"Lynchburg, VA",0,20,9.0,5.0,2016-08-05,"I went to the trial opening test kitchen invitation today. Though they didn't offer up the full menu to the test crowd, they did hand out random menu sections on 5 different color coded sheets. You're offered 3 and must order one item from each menu.  We got their buffalo style wings, crispy chicken tenders, garden salad and a combo Mexican dish with chili verde chicken enchiladas and soft taco with black beans and rice. Everything was top. I should mention that I've been to Chilis since 1985 in Orlando,FL on Seminole Blvd when I was a kid and to 8 other locations across the continental U.S. and have never had a bad meal or service. I usually go for their majestic baby-back ribs or fajitas but this time (and I was seriously blown away with this time) by their authenticity of real deal buffalo-style chicken wings, srsly, they are the best you can get in Lynchburg. Trust me, I've had wings in Buffalo, NY and this is how they are supposed to be made!  I will be back. Also, service was top as expected and even during their trial run. Keep up the great work Chilis of Lynchburg!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lynchburg,2.9320000000000004,2.9320000000000004,2.9320000000000004,2.9320000000000004,2.932000000000001
29,Bob S.,"Huddleston, VA",4,9,,3.0,2016-08-15,"Visited this location the first week open. Fortunately we got there by 5pm and got seated within a few minutes. By 6pm, they were out the door and no parking within a block. The first disappontment experienced was finding out that this location does not offer the ""2 for 1"" margaritas and other specials that most other Chili's offer. Apparently this site is operated by Chesapeake Group out of Vienna, VA, where most locations I have visited are owned by the Brinker Group. Menu items also seemed to be higher priced than other locations. Also of note is that if you like using the Chili's mobile app for ordering take-out or finding a location, you won't find this Chili's listed. Maybe they will get up to speed in the future. I hope so, as I have always enjoyed my visits to Chili's. They just need to get on board being like all the other Chili's. Like 'em or hate them, that's what being part of a national chain should be like. The staff and management were very friendly and the food was prepared as expected. Will certainly deserve 5 stars when they get the menu offerings like all other Chili's sites!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lynchburg?start=20,2.604,2.604,2.604,2.604,2.604

We took our two small children who were starving to McDonald's down the road. All the managers were standing around taking selfies with each other.

19,Lizzy B.,"Lynchburg, VA",0,32,2.0,5.0,2016-10-21,"This was my first time visiting, I arrived at opening time 11 am on Wednesday. I had the endless soup and salad which comes with an enormous bowl of chips and salsa. It was so worth it @ $7.99!! The loaded baked potato soup is amazing!! The salad is very fresh. The salsa was great. The chips were mostly good, some had a bit too much salt on them, that would be my only critique, less or no salt on the chips and let the guests put it on to their liking. The inside is very nice!! The wait staff is very attentive and at the end of the meal when we wanted to box up the salsa and chips, they gave us a fresh container of salsa and a bag of fresh chips to go on the house! I will be back for sure!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lynchburg,,,,,

6,Franco C.,"Oyster Bay, NY",828,2232,20.0,3.0,2016-11-23,"Casual dining. Chili's is another of the big chain places that you can find all over the country and this one just opened in Lynchburg. Since Lynchburg is a culinary desert, this place actually was highly anticipated just as a change of pace for everyone. Being new, this Chili's is sparkly and clean which is nice.  Also being new, the place is packed out almost every day and night as it is something new to try.  The Chili's real estate / location crew did their homework on what town would appreciate a new Chili's and then they dropped the ball by plunking it down on a small piece of property which results in a small and bizarrely laid out parking lot. Bad parking aside, the place has an overall cramped feel to it once you are inside.  Decent bar area to the right of the front doors has good and friendly bartenders back there.  Drinks are decently made and you can eat there as well. Tables and booths are crammed in the rest of the place and the whole location is noisy - I am guessing because of the small footprint and the crowd stuffed in there. Wait staff is decent - I have tried both the bar and the table service and personally prefer the bar - they just seemed more in tune with what was on the menu.  Waiters had issues answering questions around gluten free.  Speaking of gluten free, which my wife is a fan of, there is not a whole hell of a lot there that falls into the g.f. column so if you have someone with your party needing that, be aware it is very limited. Menu is extensive with a large selection of pretty much everything you night want to shove in your face to continue the upsizing of American waists.  It is all yummy looking and you can find a decent selection of items to fit your taste and budget. Fried asparagus was a hit even though it negated whatever nutrition was in the asparagus to begin with.  Fajitas were good, burgers were, surprisingly average.   Overall I think you will have a good experience here but if you come wheeling in with a large truck, you are going to have to do some fancy parking maneuvers.   Prices are average for the area and this type of dining.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lynchburg,,,,,
20,Kristen T.,"Gretna, VA",0,37,44.0,5.0,2016-12-30,This place was great . I ordered a tribleberry margarita  it was perfect. Food was affordable and delicious. The service was excellent.

28,Joy E.,"Lynchburg, VA",0,21,,2.0,2017-02-20,"Visited on a Sunday afternoon when it was pretty busy.  We called ahead and put our name in and got seated right away.  We waited about 10 minutes at our table before we even saw our server (who said, ""I will be right with you).""  When she came and took our drink order we waited another 10-15 minutes for drinks, appetizer after 20 minutes.  We waited 45 minutes for our food (I ordered soup and salad and they were served together when everyone else's meals showed up.  How long does it take to make a salad and fill a bowl with soup?).  By the time we got our meals, we had eaten two baskets of chips and salsa and I couldn't finish my food.  To be fair to the wait staff, I watched them frantically scurrying around the restaurant, looking very stressed out.  I assume that too few servers are being scheduled and they are overloaded with tables to serve.  However, the biggest problem is that the kitchen is incredibly slow. This location has been around since August 2016 and you would think they would have fixed their kitchen issues by now.  But in talking to others who have eaten there and reading the reviews on several websites, the slow and inaccurate kitchen seems to be the common complaint.  Our food was good, and hot, but the wait was just too long.  I won't go out of my way to eat there again.  Or maybe I should just get there before I get hungry so I won't mind waiting so long for my food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lynchburg?start=20,,,,,

9,Aaron P.,"Richmond, VA",131,45,55.0,5.0,2017-03-30,"It is Saturday and the college town of Lynchburg is hopping. The short stretch of humanity on North and South 29 is packed from stoplight to stoplight. The restaurants are reeling from constituents willing to wait 25-35 minutes for a table. Unwilling to be daunted I call the Chilis near The Comfort Inn & Suites and get the same chilling news, ""wait time but you can make a reservation"", so I did. Reaching my destination the restaurant boasts a modern appearance with a comfortable patio and glass walls, which on a perfect evening would be great to take in the BlueRidge skyline.  After a true 25 minute wait we were seated  and greeted with Glen. He promptly brought us drinks in a very hectic floor environment. Several times he was observed bringing out multiple drink orders, seemingly unfazed by the press of people around him. The menu is GREAT, Chilis has presented to customers a nice array for all ages and palettes. I ordered the half rack of ribs dry rub with sides of sauce for dipping- tremendous! Fiancé order the steak burrito but requested the steak be switched for pork... Glen assured it would be done and guess what.... did and done! Overall, our experience was well worth the total cost of the tab.  Notice... if you have a small party you can be seated and serves in the bar without a wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lynchburg,,,,,
12,Amanda W.,"Greensboro, NC",1,128,46.0,3.0,2017-04-17,This chilis is just ok. A group of seven us went here for lunch. We were promptly seated. We had an early lunch so only one other table was occupied. Well once we got seated it took forever before we were waited on...we waited and waited...it was to the point that I was going to get up and find the manager. Finally a girl came over took our drink and food order. Food was hot and fresh! Good portion size for the money. I was frustrated with the waitress wait time to notice us. So idk if I will be back. You would think with this being a new restaurant in the area that they would be on top of there game!!! So disappointed!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lynchburg,,,,,

We had to ask for dressing for the salads. The $10 were like kids portions at best.  Another long wait for the desserts to come that came with the meals.

23,Susan C.,"Appomattox, VA",0,30,2.0,2.0,2017-07-28,"Stopped by Chili's today with my husband.  it was our first visit to this establishment.  We arrived around 1 p.m. and it was not very busy at all.  Once we entered we waited several minutes before the hostess came to serve us.  Why, I don't know as there was only a handful of people there.  The first thing she did was ask if we wanted to be seated in the lounge.  Now, one look at us and you could tell we were not folks that would enjoy sitting in the ""lounge"" area, so I declined and said I'd prefer the dining area.  We looked over the menu and honestly were not thrilled with the choices.  We ordered:  Fried Cheddar Bites, the Sirloin Honey & Chipotle streak (6 oz.) with Shrimp, served with garlic, bacon mashed potatoes and seasoned asparagus, and I ordered the Chicken Bacon Ranch Quesadilla.  It took a very long time to receive our appetizer which did not bode well for our entrée.  While we were waiting I counted 9 servers in an empty restaurant plus one hostess and a manager.  It required two people to clear a table. One server started, then disappeared, then another came and rearranged all the dirty plates and mugs that the other person had arranged for pick-up.  I was amazed that it took such an effort to clear a table of 4 mugs, one plate, a few utensils, and two bowls!!!!!  It took forever to clear this one table with all that staff.  The servers were walking back and forth, a few were hugging each other and putting their heads on each others shoulders.  Our appetizer finally came and it was pretty good, just way too long to prepare and receive.  Once we finished that, the wait continued for our entrees.  Finally the server brought out our meals and informed us that the plates were ""extremely"" hot.  I jokingly said, ""Well, if I was Chef Ramsey then I would assume by the hot plates that the food had been in the microwave!""  She said, ""Oh no.  The food never goes in the microwave, but it was under the heat lamp waiting for the steak to finish cooking.""  My husband did order his steak well done, but why would you ever put the sides on the plate and leave it under a warming lamp until the steak was cooked???  It would make more sense to me to cook the steak , plate it and then add the sides and bring it out to the customer.  Although  the plate was ""warm"" the asparagus were cold, the mashed potatoes were lukewarm and were not seasoned.  They had no salt in them and they actually tasted as if the potato was raw or not thoroughly cooked.  The steak, well, sadly, it looked like a charcoal briquette!!!  I know a well-done steak is often charred, but I actually heard my husband cutting into the steak.  It was a thin steak and surely did not require such charring to cook it to well-done.  Just because it is covered in soot does not mean it is to the right temperature.  A chef can tell by touch the doneness of a cut of meat, not by the coloring.  We did tell the waitress that we were not impressed and she did offer to get my husband another steak but my gosh, how much longer would we have had to wait?  It wasn't worth it.  My quesadilla was okay.  Nothing to write home about.  The filling was good but the edges of the quesadilla were hard and crunchy on the edge and very chewy.  I would have rather paid for a chicken quesadilla from Taco Bell.  It did not appear as there was any effort made to prepare food in an appetizing way.  Presentation was lackluster and certainly did not look like the photos in the menu, not even close.  There was no pride in the preparation of the food.  This restaurant is on our ""don't go there ever again"" list, nor would I recommend it to anyone else.  The physical atmosphere was ugly.  The ceiling is bare with the vets visible, all the sprinkler system visible and it actually looked like a dressed-up warehouse.  The music was not very pleasant, but the severs were enjoying it as they were moving to the music while walking back and forth not doing anything.  I'd like a job like that.  If you don't mind long wait times when the restaurant is empty then you'd be happy here.  I can only imagine how long service is when they are ""busy.""  Two thumbs down from my husband and I.  Guess that would be four thumbs down!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-lynchburg?start=20,,,,,

So when I had my order for today I was beyond disappoint that my order was completely a disaster. I feel like I was chewing a beef jerky than rib. My biggest mistake was ordering through to go order and not checking the menu.  If you are going in the restaurant please do check the quality of rib.

The cheese balls (appetizer) was so salty we had to throw them out. The pasta with cream sauce was terrible and the chicken tasted like processed chicken. We had another salad dish that was mixed with wilted greens, and maybe 3 real small pieces of processed chicken I mean like real small. This reminded us of a day old fast food place. The person who got the order for us was friendly but unfortunately did not make up for the wasted money on dinners that we couldn't even eat! Did I mention this order was to go??
