We came here with some friends for a late dinner this past weekend.  The service was adequate.  They got the job done, but didn't do it in style and didn't do much more.   The food was what is to be expected at a chain restaurant of this 'caliber'.  It was mass produced and filled your stomach, but it wasn't great nor horrid. It did take a bit for the food to come out.. Maybe they had shut the grill off already??

Then we looked into the bar area. It was FILTHY to say the least.  When, oh when, will Chili's catch on to the fact people don't want to smell nor smell like an ashtray while eating...or any other time for that matter.  What a completely unappetizing experience. I thought the Chili's immediately by our house on Woodlands Parkway (Indian Springs shopping area) was the nastiest place in the area.  I was wrong. This Chili's on FM 1488 was worse. Don't get me wrong...the Chili's on Woodlands Pkwy is still a ""hole"" this one just happened to have one-upped it. That's our 2 cents.

19,Georgia M.,"Conroe, TX",11,11,5.0,1.0,2014-03-21,"We like chili's and frequently it regularly. It's a family environment with good food and the prices are reasonable. I never take the time to send complaints but this visit needs to be brought to someones attention. Last night my family went to this Chili's location for the first time as we were in that area.  Upon arriving  we were asked if we would like a table or booth.  My husband responds ""booth"" the reply was well you will have to wait for that we do not have a clean one.  At this time the restaurant is not busy but almost every table needs to be bussed.  It's approximately 7:50 P.M.  We were seated in about 10 minutes and introduced to our waitress/waiter.  We were asked for our drink order and if we wanted any appetizers.  I told our waitress (Rebecca) yes, I wanted the chips and queso and had a coupon for this,  I showed her the coupon that included the chips and ""one Shot"" You pick your sauce. She Brings my husband and daughter their drinks but mine is still being made in the bar. About 10 more minutes go by and we are now brought chips and salsa. I told her we ordered queso. She responded they are making it now.  I still have no beverage. Finally the Margarita arrives (which was perfect) and so does the queso.  She takes our dinner order and leaves.  There is another waiter working this section who's name is Rob and I know this because he was the most annoying wait staff I have ever encountered in any food establishment.  When attempting to have polite conversation with his tables he was overly boisterous and his voice was so loud we could not even have a conversation among ourselves.  I learned so much about Rob & his family that I can tell you he has worked for Chili's for more than five years along with his wife, was put in the kitchen & hated it because it is a dungeon and loves being a waiter so he can talk to people.  All of this I heard at an octave that should be reserved for very loud parties.  This went on the entire wait for our food.  At one point I begged my husband to just pay and leave.  We continued to deal with ROB and his Loud tone while we waited for our food until 8:50 P.M.  Almost an hour, once it finally arrived I asked for silverware because none of us had been given any or napkins.  She told us be right back with it.  After waiting for over five minutes I went to the bar and asked how do I get a fork in this restaurant and was given rolled silverware by the bartender for my entire table.  several minutes after my return we were brought silverware in her had not rolled and her reason was that they were all dirty and she had to wait for them to come out of the dishwasher.  Which I believe as most of the tables in the restaurant are only being bussed on a need to basis,  We are very frustrated now and just want to leave.  We eat and prepare to pay for our check and have been charged for the appetizer that I explicitly showed her the coupon for. She tells me that was only good for chips and salsa and we ordered queso.  I showed it to her again and the fact that it included the dip of our choice.  She said but I brought you salsa.  I said I did not order salsa.  This goes on until they finally take it off the check.  We pay and leave.  We go to Chili's at least two to three time monthly and have never encountered any experience close to this.  I can promise you if it happened to us there we are not the only ones.  We will NEVER NEVER NEVER go to that location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-magnolia,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002

Asked for more steaming and brought them back within less than five minutes which means they probably stuck them in microwave. This time they were still very hard but now they were dry and well they never had any flavor from the start. Waiter asked us about our meal when he brought our check, when we said we were not happy he asked my husband for his receipt and ripped off the part that you need for the survey.

It is sad to me how bad every Chili's I have gone to in the past 3 years has declined so very much. Today, we tried it one more time. The service was slow and rude. Tables were dirty and not bussed all over the restaurant. It took the hostess over 10 min. to even greet us. We were the only ones waiting on a table and there were many tables available. The waitress got our drink order wrong. It took over 30 minutes to get our food. The waitress got our order wrong for me and my daughter. The hamburger my son ordered was cold. The onion rings were so hard you couldn't eat them. They did take this item off the check but because the food took so long he couldn't order something else because he had to get to work. No manager ever came out to apologize. We have decided this is our last time to go to Chili's ever. Your standards for your managers, servers, and hostess need to be higher.

When our food came in, I proceeded to eat my shrimp, and upon that first bite discovered they weren't fully cooked. I was completely put off from my food from then on. My husband ordered his Steak medium rare, and it came back medium well. The waitress offered to have it taken away and a new one cooked. The new one came out completely rare, and had to be taken back and cooked longer.

Sunday evening - 6/12/16.    The fun begins the moment we step inside the door.  The overwhelming smoke odor from the bar area hits you.  The greeter then tells us that they've closed off part of the restaurant, so your only choice is a half-booth (even though tables were available, and we watch later groups seated there).  Fortunately, the smoking wasn't bothersome in the dining area. Our waiter introduces himself and informs us that they work in teams (seems to be the new Chili's norm) and both will be serving us.  Funny he said that, as the only time we ever saw the other guy at our table was when we begged for a spoon. How slow was the service exactly? -Both my notoriously slow eating kids had FINISHED their meals before I even got my salad. -I was thirsty coming in and received my one (and only) water refill at the 65-minute mark. -So slow that the waiter kept apologizing that they were down to one cook or thereabouts Kids meals were standard so-so quality. I had a full rack of ribs, split between two different sauces.  One was perfect, the other was super-thin and super dry.  Wife's Fajita plate seemed fairly well put together, and other than the aforementioned begging for a spoon for her rice/beans.

I ordered a water w/lime and the waitress brought lemon instead. No big deal. She fixed it quickly.  We ordered chips and queso for our appetizer. There was plenty left over...big portion sizes and the chips and salsa are bottomless.  My son ordered the kids corn dog. About 2 minutes after he ordered the waitress came out to tell me they were out of corn dogs. She said that the manager was running to go and buy some, but in the meantime he wanted to get something else started for him so that when the rest of the food came out, he could have something until the corn dog was ready. I thought that was nice! After he ordered the burger bites, she came back 2 minutes later to let us know they did have 3 corn dogs left after all. So, he got his corn dog and was happy! I felt like they were trying to be very accommodating. My daughter ordered burger bites and she liked them. She's 7 and not a big eater, so she only ate 1/3 of the food on her plate.  My husband ordered boneless buffalo wings. It was odd b/c it looked like there were 2 different kinds of wings in his basket. One he liked and one he didn't. It was strange that 1/2 looked fresh and the other 1/2 looked old and maybe re dipped in the fryer?  I got the bacon burger and started w/a house salad instead of fries. The salad was cold, and I loved that there were cucumbers in it. The balsamic dressing was delicious. The bacon burger was cooked well and juicy. Yummy flavor. It came out w/fries even though the salad was supposed to replace it. No big deal.  The server was sweet and pretty attentive. She got busy toward the end and we didn't see her for a while, but her sweet personality made up for it.  The restaurant was clean, but the ladies room could have used some attention. The toilet seats look OLD and kinda gross and need to be replaced.  Ohhhhh....you can SMOKE in the bar at this Chili's. So gross. We requested a booth ALL the way on the other side of the restaurant to get as far away from it as possible.  I feel like we got exactly what you'd expect from a Chili's experience. It's convenient and the food is decent, so we'll definitely be back w/our family. If you're looking for a date night, skip it.
