3,Maiqui P.,"Manila, Philippines",25,249,264,3.0,2015-05-17,"Chili's is one of those restaurants where you celebrate your children's  (or even your own) birthdays. Kids seem to love the sinfully tasty American food consisted of burgers, nachos, fries, wings and the like. Admittedly, I celebrated my 20th birthday here a long time ago.  What makes it perfect for parties is the lively feel of the place and the large portions of food making it good for sharing. The classic nachos have just the right amount of cheese, jalapeños, beans, beef, guacamole and sour cream dip. Just thinking about it makes me crave for it! There is also the popular choice of wings over buffalo that most kids and adults get. Kids dont mind getting their hands messy!  Since the food can be on the heavy side, the fajitas would be a good choice for something healthier compared to everything else. But savs some space for dessert because you MUST try the High and Mighty pie. It's sinful, it's sweet but so worth every calorie.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-makati,,,,,
4,Nicole S.,"Maynila, Philippines",48,106,167,5.0,2015-05-28,"I had a Chili's phase not so long ago. Every Friday, after class, I would drive to Power Plant and have late lunch in Chili's. It would always be the same order, a cup of chili and an order of Steak Fajitas.  Now, for a tiny girl, you'd be surprise at how quickly I can finish that fajita. Especially since it's a meal for two. But then again, on those Fridays, I wouldn't eat breakfast before going to school, therefore, I'm always hungry by 2 pm. But it's my go to comfort restaurant because it's the place where I can indulge in most of my cravings. Burger, steak, ice cream, you name it. Every year, I even try to join their Big Burger Day wherein any burger is only 125 pesos. I succeeded once, and never again. Chili's doesn't even have to be a lunch or dinner place, it's also good for afternoon snacks or after dinner drinking. Especially when they have happy hour and hello margarita! (Please don't think I'm a drunk.) But really, I absolutely believe that nothing in Chili's is not delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-makati,,,,,
0,Janella Marie I.,"Manila, Philippines",37,138,324,5.0,2015-06-05,"Eating at Chili's is always sulit for me and my friends. Why? It's because we are cheapskates and we like to exploit the value of our money. We actually stay at this place an average of three hours (I know right? We're super basic and gross.) But who cares when you're enjoying the restaurant's food? Not like we didn't really pig out and ordered burgers and the sinful fried stuff anyway.  Apart from unlimited Tortilla chips, unlimited drinks, and unlimited dip to go with the chips, this is the branch where I discovered that Chili's offered unlimited coffee too! Man, this restaurant is just super awesome, I couldn't help but keep on coming back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-makati,,,,,
2,Joff C.,"Manila, Philippines",1,69,69,4.0,2015-06-10,"This my favorite American restaurant in the city hands down. Their triple smoked burger is, in my humble opinion, one of the best in the city. Even at around P450 it's still quite a bargain because it's big enough to share and it comes with a sizable portion of fries. It's also served with a special chipotle mayo which is delicious - I usually ask for an extra serving.  Their other sandwiches are good too but this, for me, is the best one. I haven't tried the other items on the menu because every time I go here I always end up ordering the triple smoked burger. As far as ambience goes it's pretty standard for a family-friendly American-type joint. There's sports playing on the television and the servers are friendly yet efficient.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-makati,,,,,
1,David C.,"New York, NY",1,1,95,4.0,2016-09-21,"It's good for family or friends gathering as well as for me alone. Have a mug of cold beer with some nachos and enjoying the afternoon. I like the hamburger here. The old timer is really good,  It's so tasty as it in US.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-makati,,,,,
