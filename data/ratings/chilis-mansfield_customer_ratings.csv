8,Jeff A.,"Mansfield, TX",8,47,9.0,1.0,2012-02-01,"Chili's has good food and drinks.  The Mansfield location needs to do something about the tables.  We had received a couple of gift cards and stopped in for lunch.  The hostess was pleasant and sat us at a window-side table.  My wife's chair was filthy, as if it had been stored outside for 6 months.  Unfortunately, we didn't notice this until we had sat on the chair.  The hostess quickly offered to replace the chair.  As I moved to adjust my chair, I grabbed a handful of sticky stuff on the underside of my chair ... the kind of buildup that occurs over time (and not just one spill --- we've got 6 kids and we know the difference !) ... uugghhh.  Hmmmm, maybe this was just bad luck, so we asked to be moved to a booth.  Again, the hostess and server were both VERY nice and accommodating.         The food arrived and we enjoyed the soup and Toasted California Club sandwich.  I had the Spicy Sausage soup -- great flavor - my wife had the enchilada soup - too cheesy.           At this point, we were both a little over-sensitive to any indications of poor hygiene.  We noticed that the tiled tabletop had food buildup in the grout.  Major buildup that you could easily dig out with a fork.  Hmmm, how does that not become a haven for bacterial growth?  How does that get passed by Mansfield Health Inspectors? BOTTOM-LINE:  we like Chili's food, decor and service.  The servers, hostess and manager all engaged us and were VERY nice.  HOWEVER, this location needs a MAJOR cleaning of tables/chairs and ESPECIALLY sanitize the table tops !!  C'mon people, this is not an outdoor campground with picnic tables !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mansfield?start=20,2.212,2.212,2.212,2.212,2.212

6,Justin L.,"Arlington, TX",1,33,4.0,1.0,2013-10-28,"They need new management. We entered and none of the employees greeted us (they looked at us and continued on their break).. So we grab a menu and sit for a couple minutes. They look at us then try to avoid looking..  I was going to spend good money here (i was starving) .. But my moneys not going to this chilis.. Have some respect for your customers, teach them to respect the customer .. Was a joke.

1,Joey R.,"Mansfield, TX",24,17,2.0,3.0,2014-04-17,"I'm not a big fan of chilis.  They have however added enchiladas to the menu. They freaking rock.  The bar tender on Tues night is a bad mofo she makes great margaritas. For a cheap dinner and quick bite I would go back, as long as enchiladas stay on the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mansfield?start=20,2.572,2.572,2.572,2.572,2.5720000000000005
7,Tim H.,"Mansfield, TX",0,1,,1.0,2014-05-28,"They don't even want customers, I guess they think empty booths bring in more money. My wife and I went there on a Friday night, when we went in to check on the wait time there were two tables for two that were empty and in the back 3 empty booths. We were told the wait was 20 minutes, when we asked about sitting at the empty tables the hostess  in a sneering way said they were for an emergency. I guess not having an empty table is more of an emergency than a customer walking out which we did, never to go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mansfield?start=20,2.308,2.308,2.308,2.308,2.308
5,Karen V.,"Grand Prairie, TX",80,25,11.0,4.0,2014-06-19,I took my family here last night and I must say it was AMAZING! The server was great and the manager spent time at our table and even helped the server bring out our food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mansfield?start=20,,,,,
3,Kristyn M.,"Venus, TX",3,18,2.0,2.0,2014-07-17,The wait staff was amazing had 13 ppl at our table and she handled us great! Running drinks quick even with 8 thusty kids! HOW EVER. I got a burger and it had a strange crunch I took it apart and there was old crusty greese crumbs from the grill. ALOT of it.  I returned it With a request of a different meal. They had me pay for the replacement. I didnt make a big deal bc I dont like even sending things back. I will just never return. That manager with the crew cut really isnt very good at his job. I have been going there since it opened not any more.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mansfield?start=20,,,,,
30,Ej W.,"Arlington, TX",7,2,,2.0,2014-09-07,"Ate here on 9/6/14 around 2pn. Food and service were great. However, I found it odd that the staff for that afternoon consisted of zero minorities. I contribute the sensitivity to my HR background, but am also aware that the lack of minorities is not due to availability in the local population.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mansfield,,,,,

0,Tanya L.,"Mansfield, TX",0,1,,1.0,2015-05-21,I have witnessed their horrendous hiring tactics!! Very disappointed! As for my family and I we won't be giving any 'Chili's' our business ever again!!! If I could give lower than 1 star I would!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mansfield?start=20,,,,,
29,Elizabeth O.,"Arlington, TX",3,24,5.0,4.0,2015-08-12,"This is the best chili's around! Service is always fantastic and drinks are great. The only reason I'm not giving five stars is because of the food. I've ordered salads on several occasions and received brown, wilted, soggy lettuce. Get anything but a salad!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mansfield,,,,,
28,S. R. V.,"Mansfield, TX",7,40,,5.0,2015-11-10,I love the staff here. The waiters aren't 16 year old kids that don't care about you. They genuinely care about your food and experience. The food is Chili's food... It's not gourmet but it's good for a quick out to eat experience for family or friends. The queso is always a must-have for me. I got the margarita chicken bowl today - a recent add on to the menu. It's similar to a Chipotle bowl but the chicken tastes a bit better. It's not rubbery like Chipotle is. I love the dressing they put on the bowl. It's a little zingy and has a hint of lime. Great service. The same waitress always serves my family and has our order memorized now. We love this location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mansfield,,,,,
27,Carrie L.,"Sparks, Reno, NV",52,24,28.0,2.0,2015-11-14,Saturday night at 9:30.  Not real busy at all.  All vacant tables in bar area (8 of them) are dirty and no one making an effort to clean them.  A/C is ALWAYS on and freezing regardless of outside temp.  Service is ok but not great.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mansfield,,,,,
22,Vanessa K.,"Arlington, TX",0,7,9.0,3.0,2016-03-31,The waitress did a great job very attentive.  The manager kept walking by bit said nothing.  She was kinda strange.  The kitchen was a disaster.  I will attach pic.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mansfield,,,,,
24,Brittany B.,"Burleson, TX",81,35,,2.0,2016-05-16,"This chilis location used to be one of the best. The last 2 times I have been, the food and service has been sub-par.

23,Zandri C.,"Highlands Ranch, CO",0,17,32.0,3.0,2016-05-24,Who doesn't like Chili's? It's yummy!! They have a variety on the menu. I had the California turkey sandwich which was delicious to say the least!! And I wanted corn instead of fries and they were very accommodating without charging me extra which some places looovvvveeee to do. The trivia game is really fun too. Me and my husband play it every time we go. I liked this location a lot! It was quiet at the bar and the waitress was very nice. Yeah I'm happy.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mansfield,,,,,
18,Lauren V.,"Arlington, TX",23,13,3.0,5.0,2016-08-03,"Always provides excellent service and food. Not once have I complained of waiting too long for food, or wondered where my waiter was. (Of corse I could have just gotten lucky with great staff each time)  I like the rewards system, it's so easy to use whenever I use the ziosk to pay! (Rewards such as free drinks, apps, entrees and more!) :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mansfield,,,,,
21,Kristina W.,"Mansfield, TX",17,53,16.0,2.0,2017-03-31,"Food was ok, waiter was attentive. This review reflected our disappointment with the fact that they just tossed out our to-go box with nearly 1 full order in it, that we accidentally left on table. We were there with our 2 little kids. So, I called 10 minutes later & the girl who answered the phone just gave me a quick answer that it was gone. I explained that most of our order was in that box & asked to speak to manager, so I was put on hold for over 15 minutes & when I called back the phone was unanswered for 2 minutes, 3 times. ""Austi"", who claimed to b the manager, finally answered the to-go line, & said that it was ""against policy"" to keep to-go boxes & to ""chase people"" to give them their to go boxes, then she corrected to ""chase people outside of the building"" when I asked about a copy of the written policy. We had also half of the skillet quest in the box. It was our 1st time in many years to visit Chilli's & as I told her, that wasn't the level of service I expected. No resolution was offered & by the time I was done talking to her, it was almost 1 hour after we left the restaurant. Don't bother with this place. It wasn't worth our $30 + tip. I recommend going to either Cotton Patch or real Mexican restaurant such as Mama Cuca's for better flavor & service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mansfield,,,,,
17,Lauren M.,"Austin, TX",165,3,,1.0,2017-04-17,"Came for lunch with a group of 7. No one was in the bar area when we were seated. Over an hour and no food. Horrible service. Asked for our food to go and the waitress was rude about the kitchen packing up the food. Unbelievable and will not be returning. Asked for the manager and was told he was in the kitchen cooking and ""would come out when he could.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mansfield,,,,,

15,Mike E.,"Mansfield, TX",0,38,6.0,3.0,2017-07-04,"Liked Chili's better before menu changed. This review is mostly related to allergen concerns. Food was good but recent menu changes made it really difficult to find gluten free options. Partially because of the way that the menu is presented and partially because no one offered any real help to find options. Waitress didn't offer any help. We asked to speak to the manager and she answered one question and walked away. Almost every item is marked for ""possible cross contamination"". I also didn't like that my food was presented on a paper on a metal tray. As soon as paper was wetted by the food, the paper ripped as knife was used. This was a fave, but not anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mansfield,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68
13,Ripley L.,"Mansfield, TX",1,81,81.0,3.0,2017-07-04,"This is my favorite Chili's With that said my experience this time was less than stellar. Our wait staff was either too busy or too distracted to keep my tea filled, my steak was rare when I asked for medium, then no one asked if it was cooked right ( I like rare just never ask for it because it's never right),otherwise server was friendly and accommodating.  Still the best in the area and I will return just wish it was a bit better this time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mansfield,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
14,Tiffany D.,"Ludington, MI",12,4,1.0,4.0,2017-08-23,"We came during dinner time and ordered the $22 for 2. You get to choose one appetizer along with two entrees. I chose fried pickles, chicken crispers (honey-chipotle flavored), and half a order of baby back ribs. Fried pickles were a bit too bitter at that time presuming the oil of the batter was old. Baby back ribs were too dry and not tender. The best meal tonight would have to be my chicken crispers! They give you an option between regular or crispy and I chose crispy. They had the perfect texture and crunch. It was a bit too salty but nothing a dip of ranch can't fix. We also finished off with some Oreo molten lava cake and mmmm, that is a must try- the vanilla ice cream + a spoon of warm sponge cake was delicious. Overall, we had a good dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mansfield,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76

First of all, I waited 10 mins on hold just to get my total and still didnt know til i picked up my food! Secondly, they were out if prime ribs for my fresh mex bowl(my fave)... Which is fine... i asked if i could just have no meat. They charged me FULL price anyways... It wasnt even worth it!! Lastly, I asked for no onion no bell peps and no beans and it was LOADED with all 3. Oh and they didnt put the most important thing, the sauce.  I mean i understand its closing time but that doesnt mean you fuck up someones whole meal by not paying attention to details. Only have 2 stars bc my husbands burger is how he expected it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mansfield,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84
