14,Christiana S.,"Dallas, TX",136,604,44.0,1.0,2013-08-19,"Chili's, this one is NOT UP TO SNUFF. I like Chili's.  It's one of my go-to restaurants when traveling for work and feeling lazy about choosing a restaurant.  I pretty much always get the same meal, too, and I'm rarely let down. This place, however, was awful.  I will *not* be returning here. I ordered To-Go, which is a great feature Chili's offers.  I ordered online (sweet!) and was told what time to arrive for my food.  I arrived 5 minutes early. First thing, I walk in and there's no one in sight.  I wander into the bar and an employee that was on break noticed me and offered to help.  OK, great. She disappears for about 5 minutes, in the mean time the actual To-Go person shows up.  She appears with my food and everything, checks me out, and I'm out the door.  The service was not particularly friendly, but oh well.  Maybe she was just having an off day (and I did interrupt her break, after all). I get the food back to my hotel (a 3 minute drive) and discover my food is cold.  Not room temperature.  Cold.  And old.  It had clearly been prepped immediately after my online order and then set out at room temperature until my arrival.  Chili's...you need a text system or something if food is going to be done well *before YOU TOLD me it would be done*.  The food was not fresh, clearly, and had the rubbery taste of having been left out too long.  Really? No heat lamps even? The portions were also completely not what I'm used to.  I received about 20% of the fries I was supposed to (considering they were inedible, I didn't care anymore).  I received slightly less than half the usual amount of southwestern macaroni and cheese.  Considering you up-charge me for ordering this option, I was pissed at the meager amount I was given.  I'm not being spoiled here.  I'm serious - you gave me about 6 bites.  Ridiculous. The chicken tenders were rubbery, cold, and smaller portion too than I'm used to. This Chili's brings the brand to SHAME, and I will *not* return here.  Seeing as how I travel to Marshall about once a month for business, I'm very disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-marshall,,,,,
16,Sarah S.,"Daingerfield, TX",238,59,,4.0,2014-05-19,"We go here for drinks and appetizers, not for the food, so I can't comment there. Tip the bartender a little extra for the first drink and the rest of your drinks will be strong. Appetizers are good, but would like to see more vegan/vegetarian options available to fall in line with Marshall Get Fit campaign. Seems out of touch with locals as a result.  Typical Chili's otherwise.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-marshall,,,,,
12,Ben B.,"Phoenix, AZ",5,92,5.0,1.0,2014-12-30,"Bartender was missing 90 percent if my visit. Did not bring utensils twice, had to get them myself. Yes, I actually had to get up and go get my own utensils because bartender did not bring them with food and disappeared for lengthy amount of time both times. Poor service, food was okay but doesn't make up for it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-marshall,,,,,
13,Emily M.,"Waskom, TX",2,7,,3.0,2015-02-03,Pretty good food. The burger was greasy and way too much mayo. And bun was burnt too. The bartender/ manager had to seat us because of no hostess or she was missing in action. The seating in the booth area is way too small. You keep bumping legs when you move if your with anyone. Our seating were dirty with other people crumbs.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-marshall,,,,,
7,JG M.,"Marshall, TX",2,127,755.0,2.0,2015-11-14,"JG score of 3.5/10 (+1.5 for food, 0 for atmosphere, +1 for price, 0 for no Diet Dr Pepper, 0 for typical service and +1 for we would return) The food here is good but not standout. We just tried the Ribs with Dr Pepper Sauce and they were okay to good.....nothing special. In the past, they had Shiner Bach Ribs that we liked better. The food here is franchise and not bad just not usually WOW. They did once have a Molten Pumpkin Spice type cake with ice cream that was Wow. The atmosphere is just like all others. Nothing special. Price is usually okay.  No Diet Dr Pepper. They do have Diet Coke. Service is just typical. We visit here maybe once a year if that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-marshall,,,,,
11,Katherine D.,"Shreveport, LA",0,2,,3.0,2016-02-26,"Food was good. My problem though is when we got there it was ten o'clock on a Friday. The restaurant doesn't close till 12 A.M., I was starving walking in and it took literally ten minutes to get a table, then when my boyfriend wanted to order a alcoholic beverage they told us the bar was closed... let me remind you it was ((ten o'clock)) they don't close the bar till 12 A.M.. I went outside to make a phone call around 10:30, when I tried coming back in... the door was locked so I had to call my boyfriend to let me back in. Then when dessert came around they told us the kitchen was closed, there were three other tables in the restaurant so we couldn't get any dessert. I was beyond mad leaving out of the restaurant. We still go back because the service has gotten better but that night was flat out ridiculous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-marshall,,,,,
10,Jason G.,"Nashville, TN",246,9,4.0,1.0,2016-05-30,"I don't even want to give one star. We waited over an hour on horrible food that came out randomly. The staff seemed high/stoned... which is fine but if you can't function & do your job??? Manager said ""sorry for the wait, ok who's waiting on their food"" then we replied ""we are all waiting on our food...""   . She didn't even know what was going on. She apologized again & said the grill went down.... while we watched other people order after we got there & they received their food before us. This place is ridiculous & needs help",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-marshall,,,,,
6,Matt D.,"Salt Lake City, UT",57,75,58.0,2.0,2016-08-26,"Well, what to say. On a long road trip and we wanted a break from fast food and burger joints. Chili's is usually a fairly reliable ""okay"" meal.  Walked in to find no host at the stand, and two other groups also waiting to be seated. A server eventually showed up and seated us. Ordered Top Shelf tacos no cheese (dairy allergy), and server (apparently fairly new) forgot to put no cheese on the order, so I had to send them back. Meanwhile, wife ordered 2 tacos and got 3 (a waste since she just needed/ate 2). She got broccoli instead of the rice. Broccoli somehow tasted both over-cooked and undercooked. Perhaps it was frozen and reheated? Another 5 minutes after wife finishes, my new order of tacos comes out. STILL HAS CHEESE. Manager comes over then and tries to pull a Jedi mind trick, saying ""that was not cheese"" (thinking I'd confused a chimi-churri sauce for the cheese shreds that I'd already pointed out to the server twice). I wasn't going to wait for another retry from the kitchen, so we paid for wife's meal and headed over to Wendy's. 2 stars because at least the server was very apologetic, and wife got to eat something other than a burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-marshall,,,,,
9,David F.,"Mabank, TX",0,5,2.0,5.0,2016-10-27,I have been chatting about this topic for years . Stop by and enjoy your day . I had a great waitress named Keyha.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-marshall,,,,,
5,Alysha C.,"Jefferson, TX",6,9,,1.0,2016-11-06,"Cajun shrimp Alfredo = ice cold and over spiced shrimp on dry pasta with soggy bread 2 orders of Cajun chicken Alfredo = NO spice, tons of salt and pasta so dry it took 2 bowls of sauce to make it barely coated Chicken bacon ranch quesadilla = old quesadillas soggy on the bottom from soaking in water from the Pico Presidential Margaritas was a cup of pure sweet and sour Fried cheese poppers = greasy And salty Steak=raw Garlic skillet smashed potatoes = bland cheddar potatoes covered in gross white country gravy Corn on the cob = lots of black pepper Manager wasn't too worried and only comped the steak meal and the bad margarita",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-marshall,,,,,
8,Tori B.,"Ontario, CA",0,4,,5.0,2017-05-31,"The reviews of this Chili's made me nervous to eat here but we had an awesome experience! De'Anthony was our waiter and he was great! The environment, the food, and the service was all amazing!  I would recommend it. We were greeted walking in the door by our waiter, the food came out hot and in very good time, and our drinks were always filled at a good time as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-marshall,,,,,
1,Mateo B.,"Spring, TX",1,2,,1.0,2017-08-02,"My expectations for a Chili's are already low so I'm not sure how I walked out more disappointed than when we arrived for a quick bite to eat on our road trip. Came in on a Sunday little after noon and we were greeted pleasantly enough by our server, but it took a good amount of time to bring out some waters and a coke. That coke being primarily carbonated with very little syrup, I informed the nearest server, but was ignored until I talked to our server. He remedied it pretty quickly. I expect a sandwich called the ""Bacon Avocado Chicken Sandwich"" to come with avocado. Not only was there not any on two separate orders of the sandwich--my girlfriend and I--but each of our sandwiches contained a thinly sliced ""butt"" of a tomato. Even after we straighten it out with the server and received sliced tomatoes and avocado, the sandwiches were oily and not really enjoyable. Not only that, but the friends we were with never received half of their order. These were clearly the kitchen's error as we saw the items on the ticket.  Each one of us hard heart-burn or indigestion issues for the remainder of the car ride home (3 hours). So needless to say, we won't be returning and suggest others avoid this as a ""quick stop"". You may be making several others later if you no what I mean.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-marshall,,,,,
4,John H.,"Arlington, TX",8,8,3.0,4.0,2017-08-05,"This was probably the best experience with this Chili's location. Usually they're very slow, but this time our waitress Jonell was on point. The sunrise burger is so good. We were in and out in less than an hour.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-marshall,,,,,
3,Joe M.,"Southwest Houston, Houston, TX",0,8,,1.0,2017-09-23,"This is the worst Chilis that I've ever been to. Food was horrible - chicken crispers were rubbery, other items tasted stale and old. Service was bad too, waitress could have cared less and management never came out of the kitchen. If you're looking for a place to eat in Marshall you should go somewhere else Update: got food poisoning from this place and was sick for almost a week - yech!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-marshall,,,,,
0,Lexi M.,"Jefferson, TX",7,13,3.0,4.0,2017-11-17,"It's a nice place. Not bad prices overall, but the margaritas are like $7, so that's a little steep. It's also a little loud in there, so if you're sensitive to noise, consider bringing earplugs. They do have good food though. The waitress was nice. I had a good experience. Warning for non meat eaters: The southwestern egg rolls may look vegetarian, but they do have chicken in them. A tasty vegetarian option at this restaurant is the margarita flatbread.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-marshall,,,,,
2,Dana M.,"Sealy, TX",17,3,,4.0,2018-01-13,We stopped here for a quick dinner on our road trip. We were quickly seated and our waiter DeAnthony got our drink and app order taken.  Our food was served promptly and our waiter was on his game. Great service overall.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-marshall,,,,,
