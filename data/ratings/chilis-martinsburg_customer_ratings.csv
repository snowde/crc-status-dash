9,George H.,"Germantown, MD",32,20,7.0,4.0,2016-10-27,"It's a Chili's, so not really any surprises. Typical casual dining fare.  This is newly opened and the wait staff still seem interested in their work, which can be rare in the area. I think the kitchen staff does as well. Food came out as correct as expected at one of these places. Steak was a little under, but I like it that way.  Not sure if it's worth the drive from Charles Town, but good enough if you are in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-martinsburg,2.768,2.768,2.768,2.768,2.768
28,Tom T.,"Ranson, WV",9,1,,3.0,2016-10-29,The food was great and came out in a very prompt time . But our service was less than desired.  Had to repeatedly ask for items they forgot .,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-martinsburg?start=20,2.572,2.572,2.572,2.572,2.5720000000000005
4,Courtni R.,"Hedgesville, WV",26,103,274.0,5.0,2016-11-03,Brand new Chili's. This is a much-needed enhancement to Martinsburg's rather small selection of restaurants. It's not hard to find; it's right off Interstate 81 near the Walmart. There's plenty of parking. Our server was polite and quick. She knew the menu very well and offered insights on different food selections. My friend wanted to try the spinach queso dip for an appetizer. It was amazing.... warm queso with spinach and even a surprise of avocado on the bottom. It was paired with chips and even an additional side of mild salsa. I ordered the chicken and shrimp ($1.00 extra) fajitas. They were delicious! The portion size was much more than I was expecting for lunch. The seasoning on the chicken and shrimp was perfect and had just enough heat. The prices were fair and I felt like I got way more than what I paid for. I would definitely recommend and I will be back in the near future.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-martinsburg,2.772,2.772,2.772,2.772,2.7720000000000002
10,Wyllow L.,"Martinsburg, WV",5,22,31.0,4.0,2016-11-19,"New Chilli's! Busy for a Thurs night, but it's new. Loud inside. People were nice. Waitresses kept forgetting to bring things, but they are still getting the hang of it, and they kept our glasses full! A little pricey for what you get, imo, but it was prepared right and it was good. Ribs, chicken burritos, all were good. Drinks are good, like everywhere else like this. You can order right from the table on POS, and they keep track for you so re-order is way too easy!  It's Martinsburg, and things slide quickly after a while at places like this, so I hope the food and service stay on point. This area needs more upgrades!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-martinsburg,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997
19,M W.,"Martinsburg, WV",4,25,2.0,1.0,2016-12-20,"We were part of the ""test"" guests prior to opening. We expected the service to be slow, but it was not that bad. We met others there so we dined from 4 test menus. No one had one complaint about their food.  A couple weeks later I met my daughter for a late lunch, and we chose a high-top in the bar area.  She had a flat bread, and I had an appetizer.  After 45min, I politely asked for the Manager. We calmly explained and as he exited left our food appeared within seconds on the right.  The flat bread was warm and a burnt and my appetizer was ICE COLD.  Over 1hr spent with no real enjoyable food.  The Manager explained they were still training, comped the meal and asked for a 2nd chance. We went back to have dinner a couple weeks later around 8pm. We had to wait for about 10min in a restaurant that had as many empty tables as filled ones....the kitchen was backed up, we were told.  We ordered the triple appetizer as a meal and the chicken crispers, plus we had the endless chips/salsa as they were great during the test. AND, now we won't ever be back! The chips were not salted; the salsa had changed; the appetizer was lukewarm and so SALTY that it was inedible. My dish was just as salty, and I could be considered a saltaholic!  The Manager was summoned and immediately surmised that they were dumping the fried food into the ""salted"" french fry trough instead of the fried food trough.  Apparently she already knew they were doing it and had not done anything about it. You probably don't even want to give them a first chance!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-martinsburg,2.308,2.308,2.308,2.308,2.308
31,Rebecca B.,"South Boston, VA",0,13,,4.0,2017-01-04,"We first had to wait about 45 minutes for our table, which we understood since it was a Saturday night. However, after waiting that time and getting a table we had to wait another 25 minutes for a server to approach our table. Finally, we spoke to the host about the problem and they informed a manger who then sent a server over immediately. We had great service after that and got a free appetizer of chips and salsa. The food was great and came out in a timely manner. Finally, the manager was understanding enough to take off almost half of our check since we had waited so long in the beginning. Hopefully they will be able to work out any issues with servers and be an excellent restaurant for the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-martinsburg?start=20,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997
14,Em A.,"Martinsburg, WV",0,6,3.0,5.0,2017-01-04,"My husband and I are the kind of people who love trying out new restaurants. I read a lot of reviews on this place and was a little pessimistic. Most reviews stated the service was slow or the food was only average. We have the restaurant some time to ""settle in"" their staff.  Our actual experience was fabulous!! The hostess was very kind and seated us quickly. Our server was prompt and attentive. The food? Above and beyond what we expected!! We had a chips and guacamole appetizer that was fantastic. The salsa wasn't much to brag about but the guacamole was on point. The chips were the perfect balance of crispy and salty. My husband got the shrimp tacos which were up to par to his liking. I got the classic turkey sandwich, which was also on point! Pricing? Our order totaled about $45. My husband ordered a beer, I had strawberry tea, an appetizer and two entrees. Not a bad price for all that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-martinsburg,2.644,2.644,2.644,2.644,2.644
24,Mark D.,"Martinsburg, WV",46,1,,3.0,2017-01-05,At Chili's for the first time not impressed with the meal. Black beans cold rice cold French fries barley warm. First taco of 3 had 2 small pieces of meat no sauce for tacos had to ask. No flavor to the tacos. Chicken avacdo sandwich good pretzel roll. Not good for a first impression.  Wait staff ok. Atmosphere very loud music ask to have turned down no response. The cold beer was the winner here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-martinsburg?start=20,2.412,2.412,2.412,2.412,2.412
23,Rhonda C.,"Inwood, WV",44,22,,5.0,2017-01-25,"This Chili's is new,  so I wasn't sure what to expect.   I have gone a few times now and had nothing but great experiences.   Great service,  great food and they have outdoor seating which was lovely in the right weather!!

16,Nate B.,"Frederick, MD",0,4,,1.0,2017-02-04,"This is the worst chili's I have ever been too. We live in town so we have tried giving them several chances but have been disappointed every time. Last time I called for pickup and nobody answered. So I drove there and sat in the to go section while the clerk continued to pick up the phone in front of me and take orders before acknowledging my existence. Finally took my order I get home, food was soggy and wrong. Then went to take a bite and the chicken crispers were undercooked and raw. Good luck with salmonella poisoning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-martinsburg,,,,,
22,Sebastian J.,"Washington, DC",0,17,5.0,3.0,2017-02-14,Not bad for a new franchise restaurant. The food came out as expected and the service was decent.

2,Toby W.,"Findlay, OH",3,33,23.0,2.0,2017-04-27,"The usual chain restaurant fare. Food is ok. Atmosphere is fair. Service is what they're missing. If your going to this restaurant, do yourself a favor and bring a sandwich for while you wait.  Almost brand new store. I'll chalk this up I To growing pains but at 1230 on a Thursday I think you would be expecting to have folks coming in to eat, right? Lots of other places right next to this place.

30,Bea H.,"Hedgesville, WV",2,17,4.0,2.0,2017-05-09,"I've been here several times now. It's new, so I wanted to give them time to work out any issues. But, they haven't. Since opening, the service has gotten continuously worse. I'll give the food three stars; it's a Chili's - they have a lot of choices and some things are better than others. Requests like mayo on the side or no bacon are ignored by either server or kitchen. But the service? One star. From the hostess who doesn't seem to understand that we'd like a table, to a waitress who when hearing that the food runner brought us the wrong entree was ""Oh, sorry.""  No offer to get the right one, no deduction off of the bill, no dessert. Our waters were never refilled, despite asking and we were brought a wrong drink order as well. The sad fact is that this is a normal meal there. We have more than once been seated in a section where there's confusion about who our server is, and so we wait and wait. I've eaten here four times now. Only once was I greeted by a server in under 5 minutes. Twice I've waited ten minutes and finally gotten up to request service. The only decent server we've had there was Bailey. I will drive a little further and try the Hagerstown one to see if the service there is better than at Martinsburg.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-martinsburg?start=20,,,,,
8,Julie W.,"Winchester, VA",0,18,3.0,5.0,2017-06-02,If you do not like margaritas like me...must try the Titos Vodkarita. Has the theme of a margarita but not the tequila taste. Very good. Chicken was very moist and the honey-lime vinaigrette was fantastic in the grilled chicken salad.  What can I say about the Prime rib fresh mex bowl...OH MY GOODNESS. Heaven. The prime rib pieces were cooked to perfection. The dish had a very nice kick to it. I thought I was at a high priced restaurant in DC...it was that good. Service was awesome and the atmosphere was upbeat.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-martinsburg,,,,,
5,David B.,"Berryville, VA",2,119,,2.0,2017-06-06,"The recent changes to the Chilis menu have not done this location any favors. It's a new site, but the loss of some old standards from the menu have lowered the appeal.

15,Cyndi M.,"Frederick, MD",43,4,,1.0,2017-06-14,The MSG is out of control in this place.

My husband and my family all ordered a considerable amount of food, which means bigger bill, and bigger tip. Half the food we ordered didn't even show up.  Too bad the waitress decided to wait on the one man with a suit rather than a large family. She maybe checked up on us twice while the man with the suit was checked up on many time. No tip for her.

I'd like to point out service from the staff has always been friendly and courteous, including management - no complaints there. Just seems the dishes I've ordered always seem to be either lukewarm or overdone. First visit was right after they opened and figured well maybe they're not quite ready for prime time. Most recent visit there the burger was somewhat burnt and not very hot, but being I didn't want to wait for a new order I ate it. I did mention it to the server and the manager took it off the bill, which was really appreciated. The kids like it here so I'll probably be back eventually.

7,Brett L.,"Charles Town, WV",15,3,4.0,2.0,2017-11-06,"This is the first time I've eaten at a Chili's. We ordered drinks and appetizers during happy hour. The appetizers were tasty, although it took quite an extended amount of time to receive them for how empty the tables were. We ordered two happy hour margaritas at 6:48 and received them at 7:02, hoping to get another in by 7:00 but the extended wait time made that an impossibility. I could have looked past all of this and had a pleasurable experience had the service been great. However, our server was not attentive in the least. She did not check up on our table after our initial order until we were ready to leave; an hour into our visit. She did, however, check on a table that came in after us and refilled their drinks. We pressed a ""call server"" button on the digital terminal at our table and it was almost a half hour until she arrived. I believe our trip would have been pleasurable if we'd had attentive and cheerful service, but alas. I won't ever be returning to this location, but I'm sure I'll visit another Chili's in the future for happy hour.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-martinsburg,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8
