12,Jake M.,"Mooresville, IN",29,4,1.0,5.0,2014-01-15,Frequent lunch stop for me. Both in-store and to-go are great. Always receive positive customer service and food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-martinsville,,,,,
7,Beverly W.,"Bloomington, IN",0,3,,1.0,2014-02-16,Don't get the ribs with original sauce!  I've been there twice and walked out disappointed both times.  I had the 1/2 slab of ribs with original sauce.  They were just barely warm and the sauce was just poured over the top.  The flavor of the sauce is terrible.  The fries were just warm too.  My husband had the trio combo fajitas.  He said the steak was tough.  But his meal was hot.   The wait staff friendly.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-martinsville,,,,,
9,Brad P.,"Martinsville, IN",2,8,1.0,1.0,2014-12-27,This place gave me an intestinal parasite that I'm still dealing with a week later. Avoid at all costs!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-martinsville,,,,,
10,Larry R.,"Martinsville, IN",54,30,7.0,4.0,2015-01-13,I eat here quite often as Martinsville does not have many nice restaraunts.  Food is good most of the time.  I like that they have an evolving menu.  Bartenders are great.  Great place to watch a game and grab a beer.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-martinsville,,,,,
8,Jordan Z.,"Waynesville, MO",7,59,4.0,1.0,2015-02-08,"Walked in and wasn't greeted! Hostess was playing with her kids someone brought in to see her. Sat down, wasn't spoken to for 10 minutes! No server seemed to have our table! Bad service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-martinsville,,,,,
5,Issy L.,"Martinsville, IN",67,9,1.0,2.0,2015-07-05,"Used to be a lot better. Now half the things on the menu are no longer available. When we went the other night the soda machines were down. Impossible to navigate in a wheelchair. At all! I couldn't even get across the restaurant to the bathroom. Only gets 2 stars because I love the molten lava cake. Our visit was July 1, 2015",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-martinsville,,,,,
6,Joanne S.,"Mason, OH",0,3,,5.0,2015-08-15,"We ate there for the first time tonight. Our bartender/server was very friendly and very attentive. I think his name was Adam? Or Andy? Either way, he was great! Tried to get a dirty Girl Scout shot but they didn't have them. No worries, we will be back anyway!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-martinsville,,,,,
11,Joy J.,"Martinsville, IN",0,6,,1.0,2015-12-18,"Used to love going to Chili's in Martinsville, Indiana.  Never again.  The manager is a jerk.  Come on, you as a chain, can't you do any better....How embarrassing.  A good review goes a mile a bad word of mouth goes forever.  How rude can you be, sad to say the waitress was the  only bright spot to dinner.   Please someone do something before it's too late.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-martinsville,,,,,
4,Erika T.,"Martinsville, IN",51,16,31.0,5.0,2016-01-29,"Don't listen to the people complaining; everytime I go here, I got great service and everything I order is delicious! The margarita grilled chicken is so good! But the best think they have are the frozen margaritas!! Strawberry mango!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-martinsville,,,,,
3,Maggie S.,"Indianapolis, IN",132,1,,1.0,2016-10-09,"Awful management. As we were sitting down waiting for our food, which was actually terrible ( chicken tasted like paper, vegetables tasted freezer burnt) the bus boy cleaning a table across from us decided to take a straw and stick it in the previous persons margarita and drink the rest of it! Not only is that extremely disgusting but very unprofessional and illegal. If he's getting away with that who knows what else he's doing or what's going on in the back. Very very disappointed with my first (and last) visit to this Chilis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-martinsville,,,,,
2,Josh B.,"Martinsville, IN",11,141,510.0,4.0,2017-01-15,"They have gotten better. Our last time was perfect. In every sense. We were seated promptly and our server greeted us at the table right away. Our food order was quick, hot and accurate and our server was awesome.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-martinsville,,,,,
1,Lindsey C.,"Martinsville, IN",97,104,119.0,1.0,2017-06-02,"I will never eat at this restaurant again, although I do love chilis, this particular location is disgraceful. As if the scandalous issue about a year ago where the manager was arrested and taken to jail for installing cameras in the women's restrooms wasn't enough, the service a biracial friends and I received during our visit was downright racist and disrespectful. This franchise location released a statement after the restroom issue saying that the manager had been removed and that they profusely apologized for the intimate videos and images that the man had been able to collect during the process of his crime. Having been a customer during that time frame, I felt utterly violated but also understand as a professional and consumer, individuals' actions are not entirely controllable by the organization in which they are employed and finally returned for lunch with a friend. We were treated differently that other guests who were present at the time, visited much less by our server, and in a less friendly manner, and even over heard the wait staff commenting on how a 'person of color' was odd to be seen with 'a white' here in Martinsville. How down right disturbing, it made my friend uncomfortable as did it myself and immediately she wished to leave, understandably so. Having already ordered we did wait for our meals, paid for them and left shortly after. Shame on your location, shame on those members of your staff!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-martinsville,,,,,
0,David L.,"Martinsville, IN",23,8,,3.0,2017-11-06,Ok food.  Quick service.  Bar area is small but service is quick.  Not really a review on this chilis.  More like all of them for.the food.  Main ingredient must be salt.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-martinsville,,,,,
