34,Eric Y.,"Nevada, MO",73,64,,2.0,2013-12-07,"This place was a disaster.  How can the floor get so dirty?  I'll tell you how:  We witnessed two different waitresses in our section clearing tables and when they wiped down the tables, they just wiped everything up and off the side of the table onto the floor.  That isn't how I learned to wipe off a table, but apparently it is standard operating procedure at this place.  If you are going to do it that way, you'd better carry a broom to sweep up all the crap (French fries, straw wrappers, crumbs) that you are throwing on the floor.  Cleanliness is a real issue at this Chili's. The food was just OK.  Nothing to write home about, but edible.  The waitress that we had was weird.  She took our order, someone else brought out the appetizer, and then about 2 minutes later our food followed.  She commented that she was glad to see that the appetizer had arrived because she didn't know for sure if we had received it.  She immediately brought the check and dropped it off, failing to even ask if everything was cooked alright or if it tasted ok.  She didn't really seem to care that we were even there the rest of the time.  I didn't get anything else to drink and ran out.  Had to share a drink with my fiancé.

Drinks were hard to refill, initial request for appetizer was ignored. There was some kind of training computer based training going in at the bar with other employees.

29,Adrienne W.,"Grapevine, TX",0,20,11.0,2.0,2015-05-17,"I eat at different Chili's and this one was subpar. The rice with my entire was undercooked and the bun on my husband's hamburger was a little hard.  I don't like dirty restaurants and this one wasn't very clean. A pet peeve of mine is to beat seated at a table that is still wet from being wiped down and having your napkin placed on the wet table and this happened here. There was also a little debris left in the seats. The worst thing was the salt shaker that first felt like it had not been cleaned for a while and then this was confirmed by the fact that the lid was clogged with debris. We took one from the empty table next to us and it wasn't much better.  On the positive side, the hostess and waitress were both very nice.  Overall, this Chili's needs some help in management.

Stopped at this one on a whim as I was driving through heading north, and I was really, really disappointed.  Ordered the ribeye and it had the texture of rubber. It was rather strange and gross and I could not continue eating it. I've had many many ribeye steaks in my life so I know what it's supposed to feel like as I'm chewing and there was no way this could have actually been real meat.  The service was great, and everything else we had was delicious. I just can't get over that bizarre non-meat steak.  Probably won't be returning to another Chili's anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcalester?start=20,2.148,2.148,2.148,2.148,2.148

9,Kyle D.,"Norman, OK",0,1,,1.0,2016-07-29,"This is literally the worst chilis I have ever been to. When I pulled up, 3 of the servers were standing in the parking lot smoking ciggies and clucking like hens. As I went inside to pick up my To-Go order, I couldn't help but notice the entire restaurant looked like a pig pen. Tables, floors, the bar, and even the kitchen were littered with dirty dishes, garbage, and old food. I felt filthy just walking into the place. I proceeded to stand by the bar/to go counter for a good 10 minutes before an employee moseyed over to me and asked if I needed help. I couldn't help but notice her dirty fingernails when I handed her my money.  Shortly after that, the 3 smokey servers that were outside when I pulled up, stroll in the side door wreaking of ashtray and being obnoxiously loud.  A few very long minutes later, I finally get my ""food"", by this time I couldn't get out of there fast enough. Fast forward 5 minutes. I get back to my hotel room and start to inspect my food. Why am I not surprised? My rice is hard and cold. My cup of beans is only half full and cold. My cup of chicken tortilla soup was, I kid you not, HALF full of cheese! And the other half was (surprise, surprise) cold soup that tasted like cleaning products. The enchiladas were disgusting as well. I ended up throwing it all away. Biggest waste of 10 bucks in my entire life.  I HIGHLY recommend that you do NOT go to this Chilis. It is a roach motel.  You're better off going to Walmart and buying everything you need to make bologna sandwiches.   Overall experience, 0 stars. This place should be shut down. Absolutely disgusting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mcalester,1.88,1.88,1.88,,1.88

18,Jasmine B.,"Gorman, TX",1,31,14.0,1.0,2016-09-27,"Ok. So freezer flash frozen. The three F's. Ordered the trio skillet sensation. Asked for my steak rare of course I know on a frying skillet I'm not getting a rare steak. But at best hoping for medium.. epic fail... not only did my food arrive like 2hr late. With the most horrific appetizers known to man. Leaving Me to wonder did I really pay money for that??? Just when you think that we'll surely they can't fuck up a mixed drink only for my sister in law to order a hard lemonade it tasted like akla.seltzer. I don't know anyone who wants to drink that shit when their sick more or less pay money to ""enjoy""it. Negative Ghost rider. My steak overly done I switched wit my fiance who's steak was very much still alive and kicking . I offered him to switch with me and told him I would gladly finish killing it. So of course he did .. my ck. Was bland and tasted like a rubber band. It was obviously frozen as well as the shrimp  and my fiance ck. So after assisting the table in mourning the worst dinner of our life we decide that the government should pack that restaurant up and use it for a modern day form of tortue.  Avoid it like the plague.

The two bartenders were obviously trading out; one was closing out her till and the other was, well doing nothing. The one just standing there came over and said hi, but didn't ask what I would like or if I needed a menu, which I did. I asked for a water with lemon and for some reason she had to go to the back to get that. She sat it down and walked over to the other girl closing out and just started chatting again. I didn't even drink my water, because I had no straw. I'm traveling for business and was starving and had no time to waste, unlike the two bartenders. I waited patiently a few more minutes and then realized I wasn't a concern. Sad thing is, I always tip 50% (especially when I'm on expenses) because I waited tables 10 years before getting into my career and know that WAITERS DEPEND ON TIPS (in case you didn't know, so tip then well)!!!
