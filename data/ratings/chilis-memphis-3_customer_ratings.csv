16,Tom C.,"Del Mar, San Diego, CA",17,168,31.0,3.0,2012-05-29,"Slow service for a Chili's. Later at night but very empty. Food was good, typical Chili's consistancy, but slow.  I know the south is slow but wow.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-memphis-3,,,,,

19,Tamara G.,"Arlington, TN",2,30,8.0,1.0,2013-02-07,This used to be my place to hang w friends for a casual night out. No more! We were here last Saturday-the service was so bad! Our server was awful. We had to wait forever to be seated because they were in the middle of a shift change? Why on a Saturday evening at 5:00pm would you let most of your servers go?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-memphis-3,,,,,
18,Amber M.,"Memphis, TN",79,210,34.0,4.0,2013-09-26,"This is what you expect for a Chilis. It is good, and the service is usually decent. Usually.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-memphis-3,,,,,
15,Jeremy T.,"Bartlett, Memphis, TN",59,47,102.0,3.0,2015-01-17,"Subpar food with alcohol. It's not rocket science. If you want excellent service go elsewhere and pay for it. If you want overpriced fast food and you want someone to wait on less than most of your beckons, come here. My expectations for these places are low and yours should be too. Today I didn't want to spend a lot of money so I came here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-memphis-3,,,,,
13,Michael S.,"Memphis, TN",41,59,60.0,4.0,2015-07-12,"Had lunch here. Food was good, service was excellent. I forgot something in the store and my server caught me as I was cranking my car with the item in hand. She was attentive and took good care of me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-memphis-3,,,,,
9,Camille W.,"Memphis, TN",76,335,563.0,4.0,2015-10-15,Ladies day out so we decided to stop in at Chili's for happy hour  we all decided to be seated at the bar  the waitress/ bar tender  did a great job making drinks and taking orders but the bar surface  was sticky and needed a cleaning,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-memphis-3,,,,,
14,Kara D.,"Cordova, Memphis, TN",0,3,,1.0,2015-10-18,"I come here over and over expecting to have a decent experience just once, and I'm disappointed every time. Tonight, I have sworn it off. The managers complete lack of awareness is unsettling. Even during a vey slow time, our appetizers took over 40 minutes to be delivered, and not to our surprise, they were wrong. In our 40 minute wait (mind you we didn't even order entrees) we were surrounded by 5 filthy tables that no one even glanced at. As we watched the manager stand there and play on her phone while we sat, with no silverware, surrounded by filth, we at least thought our drinks would fill up quick, wrong again.  When the manager was finally aware we were unhappy we brought the mess to her attention and she shrugged. Done.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-memphis-3,,,,,
11,Chase P.,"Memphis, TN",10,48,11.0,4.0,2015-10-18,"This is a nice place to hang out and eat. I would altogether recommend the ""ancho salmon."" I was disappointed when they took the ""Mozzarella Cheese Sticks"" of the menu, but we will always remember the ""Skillet Queso"" I have to say Chilis pulled it together after deleting some menus items by adding a bunch more fantastic items.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-memphis-3,,,,,
12,Rob L.,"Hollywood, FL",0,12,8.0,1.0,2015-11-17,"My wife saw a commercial on TV for Chilis.  I should have known better.  We waited quite awhile for hostess to show up to seat us.  My wife said the women's restroom was a mess and the stalls were out of paper.  Despite the crying baby in the booth next to us, we decided to stay. The waiter was polite once he arrived and was fairly prompt with the service.  I unwrapped my utensils to find that both my forks and knife were filthy with food particles stuck on them, not to mention the waterspots. We ordered the chips and guacamole which came in a paper bowl.  I know this is not a fine dining establishment, but really?  I'm torn though, at least I have a better feeling that the single serve paper bowl is more sanitary than the utensils they put out.  Don't know why we didn't leave at this point.  Guess I'm a glutton for punishment.  I ordered the Special Prime rib tacos.  These would have been good had they been served at something hotter than room temperature.  Again another paper cup with my black beans in it.  I should get the name of their supplier and buy some stock in these things.  My wife ordered the ""unlimited"" Enchiladas.  Trust me, a half order IS the limit. These were gross.  They know you won't want anymore of these after tasting them.  Ick.  In all honestly, I don't think I will ever return to a Chilis. That is until my memory is gone, and my wife tells me she wants to go to a restaurant she saw an ad for on TV.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-memphis-3,,,,,
17,Diane W.,"Memphis, TN",0,3,2.0,2.0,2015-11-30,Came on a Monday night and ordered 2 chicken sandwiches and fries. Took 52 minutes to get the food which was WAY too long. Good was hot and fries were good. Service was sub par. Total bill $24.54.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-memphis-3,,,,,
7,Jermaine S.,"Memphis, TN",42,16,44.0,3.0,2016-01-06,"This is one of my old standbys. The wife and I used to come here a lot when we were dating. We stopped for a while because the service got really bad. I think it was due to the high turnover and overall low quality of management and employees.  Good news! They have gotten better. We have been coming here consistently for a couple of months now and the service, menu selection and food have all gotten much better. They still have work to do but it's much more bearable then before.  There is even the added perk of happy hour after 9pm til close. Half price apps and drinks...can't beat that!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-memphis-3,,,,,
6,Phil M.,"Myrtle Beach, SC",142,244,63.0,2.0,2016-01-30,"Wow just got here, and was told if we wanted to sit at the bar to go ahead, then a table opened up but was not cleaned up and the host to us to go ahead and sit there and someone will come clean it. We waited 5 minutes at that table and received no service and was disgusted to sit at a table with other people's food on it. We went to the bar and the bartender was the hardest working person in the restaurant. She was running for tables and managing the bar. She helped to restore what others failed in this restaurant. The food took 40 minutes to come out. We were late for our movie even though we arrived an hour before. This was the worst Chilis experience I have ever had. I would not recommend this location until something changes. The only reason I gave two stars is because the entree was good and correct. The appetizer was a joke, fried pickles were more like fried pieces of crust.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-memphis-3,,,,,
10,Adrienne W.,"Arlington, TN",5,24,16.0,1.0,2016-03-20,"Once again....terrible service! I visit this location since it's close to my house and everytime they disappoint! Today's wonderful visit involved me attempting to order take out, only to leave with nothing and treated the same worse than that. I waited for the waitress to come to the counter for five minutes. Once she showed up she sighed and rolled her eyes at the sight of me. She asked my name and number and I politely replied I wanted to place a order. She sighed heavily again and then said ""what you ordering"". I politely said no thanks and have a nice day. DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION AT ALL!!! Why spend your hard earned money for reheated food served by rude workers. 3x's a charm and I WONT RETURN to this location ever!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-memphis-3,,,,,
8,Al M.,"Memphis, TN",58,1,,1.0,2016-12-03,I typed organic into yelp and Chili's came up. Total waste of my time. I will never go to a Chili's again,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-memphis-3,,,,,
1,Paul F.,"Cordova, TN",26,161,12.0,3.0,2017-02-03,"I haven't been to chilli's in forever. I a whim I decided to give it a try again. I sat at the bar and the service was great!!! Food was a little slow but it was slow like it is suppose to be, not the usual rush job.  Food was average not bad and not life changing. It was hot made like I asked and fresh. Problem is there Are just so many good and great restaurants around here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-memphis-3,,,,,
5,Leslie L.,"Cordova, TN",2,46,16.0,4.0,2017-04-11,"Where do I start?  I would have given 5 stars if there was someone in the to-go area.  Had to wait at the bar.  No biggie but I was there for a to-go pickup!  Ordered the chicken fajitas and chipotle-honey chicken strips on the 2 for $22 menu.  I have no pictures because the fajitas were off the chain.  I gobbled that up.  No, I did not go off my diet.  I only ate them to write this review.  Son had the chicken strips.  Too sweet for me.  Overall, the food was pretty tasty!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-memphis-3,,,,,
3,Mary C.,"Memphis, TN",20,21,1.0,1.0,2017-06-09,"Since I have to give them at least one star in order to give them a review..... This dinner for 2 was horrible!!! The chicken was tough, the rice was dry and the broccoli was not even cooked, it was cold. Then when we tried to tell the manager  he tried to charge us for 4 ice teas and wanted to charge me $18.00 for and house salad with a few shrimp in it!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-memphis-3,,,,,
4,Ted E.,"Arlington, TN",1,16,1.0,2.0,2017-08-06,"I spent 7 minutes on the phone to ask a question about a black bean burger. So, I decided to go to the restaurant and order to go. I asked for the Old Timer with a black bean patty and PEPPER JACK CHEESE. She brung me a burger with American cheese and no condiments. No big deal. I ask for a slice of pepper jack cheese and condiments. She goes back there and I hear the cook say,""We don't have any more sliced pepper jack cheese, we only have shredded pepper jack cheese. Ask him if that is cool."" She comes back and gives me shredded cheese without asking me if that is cool, KNOWING I asked for a slice of cheese and not shredded cheese. The experience was the typical 3.5/5 until she decided to give me what I did not ask for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-memphis-3,,,,,
2,Jason J.,"Arlington, TN",129,7,3.0,2.0,2017-10-23,"About every 6 months we have to go to this Chili's and remind ourselves why we DON'T EAT HERE. It's always the same story... You walk in and they have only staffed half the restaurant, so you have a 20-30 minute wait while you look at empty tables all over the restaurant. Then you get a descent server, who is then made to look stupid by an inept kitchen staff. The food that comes out is wrong, cold or looks like it was thrown on the plate with little regard. I remember when we loved going to Chili's for drinks and dinner and it was fun but for the last few years... it's diners beware.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-memphis-3,,,,,
0,Tiffany J.,"Memphis, TN",64,40,62.0,4.0,2017-12-18,"As you can tell by now, Chili's is one of my favorite eateries! I enjoy the family friendly atmosphere and the great food. Whether you are trying to eat healthy or if you want to just get your grub on, this is my go to spot.  The prices are always reasonable and if you sign up on the email list they will send specials that they have throughout the week.  They have a great happy hour, with 2 for 1 specials. The drinks are not that strong, but it is just right if you want to take the edge off from a long day of work.  On this particular day, the wait time was longer than expected (which was a surprise)  because it wasn't really busy. We also waited a long time for our beverages and the waitress barely checked in on us. This same issue seems to be an issue across the board with Chili's.  Anyway, I enjoyed the time with family and my food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-memphis-3,,,,,
