Some nights I get... service, other nights I get the coolest waiters. Regardless I can't really say I've had bad service here. To the food, your standard fast casual Tex-Mex fare..., quality and freshness and all that... so-so, still it tastes really good (even if the burgers and steaks aren't cooked as done... or as for memphians cooked too done). The only thing and I think this is probably the same for other chili's is that their mashed potatoes are clumpy... gluey overall horrid with a bit of garlic and stuff for flavor... if they can get the texture down... and get their food to come out hotter(not cold just kinda barely warm) that would be great. Also the guacamole... no. Overall decent food, good service and some fun with friends... especially if you go during happy hour, who doesn't love 2 for 1 margaritas or other mixed drinks right? :D",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-memphis-4?start=20,2.16,2.16,2.16,2.16,2.16

44,Joel C.,"Cordova, TN",14,133,,2.0,2013-09-29,Managment changed a few years ago. It is not what it used to be. I wouldn't go here to sit down and eat. The customer base has changed a lot. I ordered some to-go last night and went and picked it up. I got a real feel of the place not being what it used to be since I have been here a lot over the course of many years. In the waiting area of the to-go section the floor was very dirty with chips and what not. I felt as though the enviroment was on the low end of mediocre and just the general feel of the place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-memphis-4?start=20,1.832,1.832,1.832,1.832,1.8320000000000003

It's a chain, but they have a great happy hour and it's generally pleasant.  I did have an awful experience there the other day, which I feel is worth mentioning. Basically they don't have a server in the bar at lunch, so even though I was told I could sit at a booth in the bar, I just had the bartender (for the entirely full bar). I only got a drink refill after asking someone else for it, and even though I was only about a quarter done with my food, she tried to take it, brought me the bill, and brought me a to go cup ""because it's bigger and you won't need as many refills.""

24,Rachel K.,"Memphis, TN",303,48,77.0,1.0,2014-04-07,"I've eaten at several Chili's locations in the past. But because of my most recent visit to the Chili's near Poplar and Perkins, I'm confident to say that I may not again visit a Chili's in the future. The service was absolutely terrible. There was no host/hostess when our group of four walked into the restaurant. We stood around and waited for a few minutes, while other servers walked past us and the bartender just blankly stared at us... Since there seemed to be no host/hostess around, we decided to sit at a table in the bar area. It was difficult choosing which table to sit at. We had he option of sitting at a dirty table, nasty table, and gross table. We chose to sit at the LEAST DIRTIEST of the tables. We sat at our sad, dirty table for about ten minutes. Then a server finally came to clean our table and take our drink orders. Although she wiped the table (with a dirty tag) there was just TRASH all over the floor! When I walked to the restroom, I could see there was trash under almost EVERY table. There was trash on the floor even in the kitchen!! Next, our food arrived. 2 out of the 4 meals were INCORRECT. But because the service was already lacking, we didn't even want to complain, knowing that our complaint would probably be shrugged off. The whole time we were eating, there was a child about 2 or 3 years old, running around the restaurant and through the kitchen. He was barefoot and wearing a saggy diaper! It looked to be one of the Chili's employees' baby. An employee brought his or her child to work and let him run around the kitchen and eat fries off the ground. A man who appeared to be a manager was standing around laughing and not even paying attention to the mess and to the unhappy customers. This location is very unkept. Please look at the photos from this location that I am posting as well!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-memphis-4,1.6680000000000001,1.6680000000000001,1.6680000000000001,1.6680000000000001,1.6680000000000004

36,Ashley W.,"Memphis, TN",3,12,,1.0,2014-11-14,"Last was hands down the worst service I've ever received. The service actually would have been better if the server had delivered the food and never returned. We tried to give him the benefit of the doubt throughout the meal considering we were a slightly larger party and everybody has off nights, but what happened at the end of our meal was completely unacceptable. Some people just don't have the personality to be a sever. It takes a special person to be a great server and this guy did not have it at all. He seemed annoyed the whole time and since we were sat right by the kitchen we could hear how frustrated he was with his coworkers as well. At the end of the meal one person in our party paid with a card and he was helping him use the kiosk that you now have to use to pay. The person said they would tip him in cash since he was hovering over him while entering his card. The server came back as we were starting to get up and asked the person where his tip was. Give us a chance to get our stuff together dude!! I paid my check with cash and he got really annoyed that I wanted change. I always tip 20% at least and giving him all my change would have been a 30% tip. I've given 50% tips before for service that was above and beyond excellent, but his was not. Just ridiculous. Then as we were putting coats on, I had my one year old in my arms when another server emerged from the kitchen with a large tray of food. The other server said excuse me and before I could move out of the way, our server put his hands on either side of my shoulders and tried to physically move me with my kid in my arms!!! It was insane and I'm sure the whole restaurant heard me tell him not to touch me.  I will never return to a Chili's unless I absolutely have to. The food is mediocre and clearly the service is beyond lacking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-memphis-4?start=20,1.604,1.604,1.604,1.604,1.604

You'd think being in East Memphis they'd be better equipped to handle a rush, but they're not. The staff are just downright rude and neglectful, even after explaining I am in a rush, I get completely ignored. On two separate occasions when I've been I found the service so appalling I asked to speak with a manager, was told one would be coming by, but they never did, despite me asking multiple times. Clearly then this location doesn't actually need anyone's business. This part isn't this location's fault as menu changes are corporate decisions, but I hate how they keep updating their menu. Things I like keep getting removed and replaced with stuff I hate. I would consider going to another Chili's in the future, but definitely not this one.

We waited a while to be acknowledged by a hostess, just standing around while staff walked past us. We were seated next to a large, loud party in a tiny two person booth. When the waitress came to get our orders, I asked what time the kitchen closed and if we could count on getting good food that wasn't rushed. I was reassured that we had plenty of time to order and that it was no problem. So we ordered and when our food finally arrived, my mozzarella sticks were cold and rock hard :( Hungry and disappointed, I made the waitress aware of the issues and she sent over a manager so I could parrot the same story. The manager took the item off of my ticket and offered to remake the cheese sticks but for me, it was too close to the time the kitchen closed for me to confidently expect edible food on attempt #2.

Otherwise, I would probably not come here, and I actually would have gone to On the Border or Macaroni Grill, just thought this was more kid-friendly.  Our server was super sweet, but overwhelmed, though I felt like she probably did her best. She forgot my kid's chocolate milk, so he received it AFTER we finished eating.  We waited about 45 minutes for our food to come out, so we were too hungry to even consider sending anything back. The cooks browned my kid's cheese pizza to the point where, if you did this at home, you'd growl at yourself, then scowl while eating it, and sigh heavily after deciding to throw the rest of it out and order some Papa John's instead. He felt the need to put KETCHUP on it to even consider eating any of it. He ordered mashed potatoes as his side (yeah, weird, I know), and, again, put KETCHUP in the taters to mask the odd taste. I tried it, and even though I liked it, it didn't seem to be made for a kid, had garlic or something in it...or it was old. I really couldn't tell. I ordered the Classic Bacon Cheeseburger. Their signature sauce was very good, and their garlic pickles were a great touch. The bacon was cooked perfectly and was really, truly a satisfying burger. The fries were good, as well, and I took the rest of those home. The best part of this visit was that molten lava bundt cake thing with vanilla icecream. The server rushed it out, because it was ""melting, and just let me know if you want another one!"" I told her I didn't care, as long as it tastes good. Indeed, the bundt cake was collapsing under the weight of the icecream, but she wisely provided 2 spoons, so my kid and I dug in. I've never seen Rowan eat so fast in my life, I felt like it was a race against time. It was very delicious, and I give that dessert 5 stars, falling apart, hands-down. A happy kid is everything.

I said ""I didn't see a napkin.""  ""Oh I'll get you 1.""  No acknowledgement that she never brought one, let alone an apology.   Drink arrived as I was finishing Dinner.   Loud rock music [Why not turn it off & let people relax?] & patrons almost shouting @ 5pm. I took off 1* for Ambiance ~ left with a headache ~ & 1* for mediocre Service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-memphis-4,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04
23,Benolyn C.,"Memphis, TN",13,10,1.0,1.0,2017-01-08,"We have visited this Chili's location twice in the past month and both times are experience has been awful. The service in both visit was extremely slow. On the first visit, we ordered our food and after eating for 45 minutes we asked the manager about our meal.  The manager said it would be right out, which it half was.  The server brought the kids Mac and cheese but the fajitas were left back in the kitchen.  After waiting, we went to the manager again about the fajitas the they came out cold. Yesterday, we decided to give them another shot.  We were seated and our drink order was taken and 15 minutes later the drinks appeared.  After we received our drinks, we ordered our food one of the food orders came our wrong.  We were never checked on once our food was brought. We had to get our own napkins and only saw the server to drop off the check.  The one positive, the credit card was ran quickly. The service and management at this location has declined.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-memphis-4,1.88,1.88,1.88,,1.88
22,Wes R.,"Memphis, TN",5,21,,1.0,2017-01-12,In college this was the place to be so much fun it's sad to see how bad it is now. Placed a to-go order at 6:30 online they say the order will be ready at 7. I arrive at 7 on the dot. Order isn't ready till 7:25. In my opinion shut this place down or start over. I do have to be honest I should of expected this it's been like this for a few years now. If I didn't get a gift card I wouldn't of even tried.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-memphis-4,1.88,1.88,1.88,,1.88

20,Peggy R.,"Memphis, TN",0,27,,2.0,2017-02-23,Why was there a security guard inside this restaurant? Tried to go at 7 on Thursday and no one came to the hostess stand to greet us. We left after a few minutes. Didn't feel welcome and the security guard thing was weird.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-memphis-4,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92
11,Leonor-Lee G.,"Raeford, NC",45,8,,5.0,2017-04-19,"We loved this place.  I had only been to a Chili once in my city area which is Fayetteville, NC.  We were in Memphis to visit Graceland.  I can't say enough nice things about this place and the waitress.  The grilled chicken salad was outstanding.  The food came pretty quickly and the waitress was very, very nice.  As a result we are going to our Chili's in Fayetteville tomorrow because I was with my grown son in Memphis and I want to take my husband to enjoy now.  I will definitely go back next time I'm in town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-memphis-4,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04
9,Madison L.,"Cordova, TN",0,5,,1.0,2017-07-30,"Placed a to-go order online where the estimated wait time was 24 minutes, arrived at the store about 20 minutes after placing the order and proceeded to wait an additional 30 minutes for the order. The pasta I ordered was ice cold after the ten minute drive home. The store was dirty, trash on the floor, tables needed bussing. Had to step over a pile of trash swept into the middle of the floor and left there. I don't expect much from chilis but if your lobby is that disgusting, I wonder what the kitchen looks like. Will never be returning to this location, save your money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-memphis-4,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04
10,Carolyn D.,"Memphis, TN",0,21,,1.0,2017-09-14,"Yes, I think so. I am rating this restaurant for one reason. I was taken for about $1.00 on a gift card, just found out today when I visited a Chili's in Oxford, MS today. This is what happened, I went to Chili's at 4609 Poplar in early August 2017 and ordered a take-out meal. The waitress came brought me a menu then left and came back for my order over 15 minutes later. My order was less than $10. I paid for the order, about 20 minutes after I ordered, I paid with a $10.00 gift card. The waitress took my card and left the ticket and the gift card for me to sign. I  drew a line through the tip line wrote the total and signed. I did not leave a tip and did not give this lady permission to take my change on the card. She did not deserve a tip. She kept me waiting too long for a takeout order. I was not willing to give her a tip. So she stole my balance on the gift card. The card never expires, therefore when I was told today that the Chili's gift card was zero balance, I immediately knew what had occurred. Shame on this thief. If I wanted her to have a tip, I would have given her a tip. You just can't trust some of the people at this restaurant. Watch out for your gift cards and credit cards. I have heard stories about crooked workers at east Memphis restaurants stealing off customers credit cards. SHAMEFUL!!! I ordered ribs and the meal was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-memphis-4,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04
