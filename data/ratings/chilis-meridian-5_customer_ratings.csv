I also love the Enchilada soup, it was a little thinner than I remember but the chicken is so tender and the flavor is so tasty. Our server gave us a bag of warm chips to go home with our left overs. It was a very fun lunch with my grandma.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-meridian-5?start=20,2.544,2.544,2.544,2.544,2.544
23,Kevin N.,"Auckland, New Zealand",23,71,7.0,1.0,2014-03-26,"Ordered lunch from here and really enjoyed it. The California Club Toasted Sandwich was ok - above average but nothing earth shattering. However, the Southwest Chicken Soup was incredible. Extremely tasty! I ordered To Go, and the service was perfect. Very friendly staff. However, now I check my confirmation email against my receipt and find out that I have been overcharged by almost $5!! I was happy with the food, but not with this - especially when they had my order details and pricing in front of them. You made an extra $5 off me, but you have lost a customer and earned yourself a poor review. It was a 4 star review before, but now I'm going to 1-star.

My kids love the kids menu.  There salads are worth trying, although I should have ask for the dressing on the side.

26,Phillip D.,"Meridian, ID",40,83,,1.0,2014-07-15,"Chili's has been, at least up until now, our fall back place to eat in Meridian. We typically stay close to where we live, well, because we are lazy.  When it comes time to eat, we just dont want to have to go very far. I am from Texas. Everything in Texas is a long ways off. So its normal to drive and drive a lot. We would drive a half hour to an hour just to find a good restaurant.  Well, those days are over. I am 53 now and I just cant wait that long. If I did, I might end up on the side of the road. The stone above my grave would read. ""Here lies a good man that just took too long trying to find a good restaurant and died en route"" I dare not take that chance, so I stick close. I used to love Chili's. After all they made a pretty good Chicken Fried Steak. But you know. when you grow up, you tend to put childless things behind you. Chili's is one of those childish things that has to go. I just cant eat bowls of grease anymore like I once did. My stomach will revolt. My Chicken fried steak was awful. It was small, greasy, not crisp and very very hard to chew. A good Chicken Fried Steak should be so tender, that it cuts like butter and melts in your mouth the same.  A good Chicken Fried Steak is not Greasy, its large enough to take an average sized plate in a single bound, and its Crispy. And to top it off, when I told the waiter, the manager came over to our table and told us that he was going to give us a whopping 50% off my meal. Not 50% off our ticket, or a full 100% off my Fried goo, but just half off mine. We will not be back!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-meridian-5?start=20,2.148,2.148,2.148,2.148,2.148

I asked him if he knew hat time it was on and he said no because he doesn't like football. He thinks it's boring.  When then were seated in a corner both. The seats had crumbs all over it. I brushed it of and the host asked me if there was was food the seat and I told him yes. He was sorry there was food.  We were then gr by Madison. She was very nice. We ordered our food.

27,Charles F.,"Meridian, ID",70,207,939.0,3.0,2015-01-25,"Friday Night and foggy conditions made our decision to visit our local Chilis an easy one.  This place was packed.  I must confess I have not been to a Chilis state side for several years.  Matter of fact the last time I was at a Chilis was in Tuxtla Guttierez, Mexico. There are tablets on each table.  Some kids were playing games as well as bad husbands and boyfriends who find it more interesting than their wife/ girlfriend. The menu is more grown up and complex as well as more expensive.  My wife wanted a margarita and we ordered the Mango Margarita with the Patron shaker.  The server and the bartender did an awesome job of making her drink perfect.  ( Not an easy task ). I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Salad and my wife ordered a three item Mexican Combo.  Enchilada, soft taco and tostada.  Typically ordering Mexican food is a disappointment where ever we go, so my expectations were low.  My salad was of a very nice heaping portion and well presented.  They same could not be true for my wife's dish.  The picture in the menu neatly displayed all three items on one plate.  This did not happen.  The tostada was on one plate while everything else was another.  The other plate was double played and was extremely hot, like it was parked under a salamander waiting for the tostada.  The tostada had fresh beans and the tortilla itself had a nice crunch to it. It was not greasy.  Good.  The plate with the enchilada, rice, and beans was killed by the heat. It was ok for the melted sauce on the enchilada but the rice became little missiles and the beans were now baked.  The suggestion would have been to plate the enchilada, then the tostada and then the rice and beans. Our service was efficient and friendly and the table tablet was not used.  Our server did indicate to us that we could pay that way.  Being old fashioned, I was content to hand over my credit card and keep the table tablet playing for the kids.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-meridian-5?start=20,,,,,

33,Jess J.,"Boise, ID",0,2,,2.0,2015-02-26,"Me And my family love to eat at chilis however this location is not ideal. We normally go to the Franklin location because we get the best service there. However the Eagle one is closer. Every time we go there we end up waiting forever for the server to even bring us menus (we sit in the bar area for happy hour!) then once the server finally come we have to wait another 15mins for them to bring back our drinks then take our order. My husband ordered the spicy shrimp tacos without the spice. You see our daughter loves shrimp so he did that for her. The server didn't even write down our order. So when he brought the food, naturally my daughter takes one of the shrimps and plops it into her mouth. The spice was clearly still on there. She spit the bite out and started to cry. She had to chug water for the spice to get out. When we told the server he asked ""are you sure it's spicy"" keep in mind me and my husband both tried it and it was even spicy to us, he didn't Ben offer to take the food back.

20,Jeremy M.,"Boise, ID",14,131,4.0,1.0,2015-06-07,I have not eaten here in a long time. The only reason I did was because it was via gift card. We ordered online and were told that our takeout would be ready at 4:30. I got there just after 4:30 and waited 5 min for anyone to greet me. While waiting I had a good view of the kitchen. There was a woman working in the cooking station and another female was cooking. They were all over each other. It was disgusting to thing that these two people who are in charge of making the food kept hanging all over each other. Holding hands and getting way too close in that kind of environment. I do not care what you do at home but that was NOT THE PLACE FOR IT! I will never go there again. I finally got help when a guy and a girl came out from the back and asked if I had been helped.

18,Mark Z.,"Meridian, ID",2,18,2.0,1.0,2015-09-28,"This review is about Chili's in general and not this particular Chili's.  On the whole. Chili's is cutting corners with their food quality and ignoring their customers council. The food they serve looks nothing like what is on their menu, the quality of food is poor. Once they had amazing chicken fried steak you could cut with a fork. Now it's smells like rotting meet, is very thin hard to cut with a knife and almost impossible to chew. Hot wings are very very small, nothing like menu. Poor. Quality chicken, and disgusting. The new commercial....really, look at the huge one being shown being eaten. Then look at the skinny scrawny taco time burito shown all rolled up at the end. Allfiction.

We had originally tried to place our order online- come to find out once we had put everything in that this location is not setup for online orders through the Chili's app. Calling in the order was a ridiculous process, I don't think repeating an order 4x is necessary. Nor is it appropriate for anyone to question their tip when checking out!  Part of our order was missing when we picked it up, and while the manager was super sweet about it- the kid running the ""to-go"" section and the girls rolling silverware just to the side of that area were very rude and acting like we were out of line for asking that our order be filled completely.

13,Jenny L.,"Boise, ID",1,23,1.0,1.0,2016-03-30,"Dined at Chili's with a total party of 4 adults, a 9 year old, and a 2 year old on a weekend evening. As expected, the place was busy, but the host was unfriendly and abrasively told us there would be a 30 minute wait because they only had 4-person booths available. We said we would be willing to squeeze the 9 year old on one side of the booth with 2 of the adults and put the baby in a high chair at the end of the table if that left enough room for staff and customers to move around. The host, appearing irritated, said, ""Ok, if that's what you want,"" then informed another host to grab a high chair. As we were being seated, the two hosts were whispering to each other and looking at us as if we've grievously inconvenienced and offended them. As it turned out, the booth worked fine and even with the high chair, there was plenty of room for servers to maneuver.  The service was incredibly slow, which I partly forgive because i understood they were busy. What I won't forgive is my $15 steak sitting for so long in the pass window under the heat lamps that it turned gray and had the texture of shoe leather. In addition, the accompanying mashed potatoes were cafeteria slop and the vegetable medley had been cooked to mush, which I imagine had less to do with how long the plate had been sitting before service and more to do with how they were poorly cooked in the first place. I informed the server of my concerns and that i wished for a freshly cooked plate. She was very apologetic and sent a manager to the table, who gave a bevy of excuses and no actual apology. The fired me a new steak, which was fresher than the first one I received but still lacking in flavor and quality. My dining partners were underwhelmed with their entrees as well.  The only thing remotely redeeming about Chili's is their chips and salsa, but with a boat load of other restaurants (and grocery stores!) which have chips and salsa just as good or better, this isn't enough to keep my business. I feel Chili's is unimpressive and overpriced with low quality pre-made food.

He had 4 doubles of whisky, couldn't walk to the bathroom without stumbling. He wanted more & she was going to give him another drink. My group of friends had to raise a pretty big stink to not give him another drink. She made a big deal about going on break to smoke her vape. While she was gone a server took over the bar & was passing out free shots of Fireball. I would expect this at a bar in downtown Boise, not in Chilis!

Chard.   That's OK, I was just going to check the tab to see if I was charged for the 9 oz.  I was. Brought it to our server Sabrina's attention for which she apologized and actually knocked a couple bucks off the price for a 6 oz!

Ordered margaritas and food/appetizer type items off the happy hour menu, which range from $3-5. We get the bill and everything but our drinks is either double the price or more than it's supposed to be. I asked the server why our food was the wrong price and she proceeded to tell me in order to get happy hour pricing on food you have to sit in the bar regardless if you're there during happy hour. However your drinks are happy hour specials regardless where you sit. Needless to say this was the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life and I don't know any other restaurant with this policy as it's completely absurd. When I go somewhere for happy hour I check the menu for the timeframe (ex. 2-6PM) and dates and I'm not searching for some microscopic text that says ""bar only"". The server and her manager chose to not rectify the issue and still charged me double for my food. I will not be eating here again at a restaurant that scams it's unknowing customers. Our server didn't even have the decency to mention said policy when I pointed to the happy hour menu and specifically said ""I would like to order the $5 happy hour special boneless wings.""

Went back on Sunday and discovered that the same order of Fajitas is very different at the same exact location.  This time when I ordered my fajitas rare, the waiter (who started out GREAT...but wait, there's more about him later) informed me that you can't request it done any way, as it only comes out medium.  When I asked why he said because it's just a cheap cut of flank steak which is really thin.  Hmmmm, the day before I got a thick cut of actual steak done rare as I requested. Food was not great, but the appetizer of Texas Cheese fries were very good; however, we could not finish all our food and asked our waiter for a couple of To-Go boxes.  He brought us back 3 tiny ones and when my husband kindly asked him if he could go get a large one the waiter then got really snarky and said, ""Why, you're not going to take those fries are you, they won't be any good.""  My husband then said  that it was not up to him (the waiter) to decide how he would eat his leftovers and then asked a bit more firmly once more for a To-Go box.  Then the waiter got really beligerent at my husband and stormed off.   My husband gave him our credit card and waited and waited and waited...finally, he had to ask a manager to get him his receipt so he could leave. After this horrible experience we will NEVER step foot in there again, and here's why....2 days later it just so happens that someone got a hold of our credit card number (not the card, just the number) and racked up $1,000 of charges....hmmmm....not sure how that could have happened since the only place we used our card where it actually left our eyesight, and for quite some time. was here....just sayin' BE AWARE!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-meridian-5,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
