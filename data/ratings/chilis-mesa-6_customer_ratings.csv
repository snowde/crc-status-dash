The manager was kind enough to comp our aps, but she could have done more.  The kitchen was supposedly backed up, so they held off seating people until the kitchen could catch up.  Now with at least six empty tables, why couldn't they seat us and provide us with drinks, space out the aps and main course, and everyone would have been happy.  I think the blame falls on the management on this one.  The food however was good, not exceptional, but chain restaurant, you really can't expect superior food, but its fine for after a movie.  A nice change from the local pizza joints.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mesa-6?start=60,2.1879999999999997,2.1879999999999997,2.1879999999999997,2.1879999999999997,2.1879999999999997

24,Eric A.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,34,16.0,2.0,2013-08-18,"It's Chilis - nothing to rave about. Inside decor is nice. Restaurant is clean. Food was that mediocre hit or miss quality that you come to expect from a big, neighborhood chain restaurant.  One thing my wife and I did find exceptionally annoying, though, was our waitress. She paid almost no attention to our table and, when she did, she tried to cram in as many of her duties at once. For instance, halfway through our meal, both of us still eating and with forks in hand, she asks, ""Can I get you some boxes to go? Will you be having any dessert?"" We told her that we weren't sure about either yet as we were still mid-meal but that we'd let her know. However, she never checked back with us and we didn't see her again until 15 minutes after we had both finished entirely when she brought the check.  Also, we received only one water refill the entire time (pre-meal) in which she spilled water all over the table filling my glass and then said to me, ""I'll bring you some extra napkins so you can soak that up."" Huh? ME clean that up??  Based on our experience, I think the other reviewers complaints about service are legit. Don't imagine we'll be back anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mesa-6?start=40,1.9280000000000002,1.9280000000000002,1.9280000000000002,1.9280000000000002,1.9280000000000004

We sat in the bar & there was only 1 waitress to service the whole area & of course it's super bowl sunday.  Waters had floaties-yuk. The waitress says it looks like it's from lemons so of course we say we didn't have lemons with our water. So we get some new waters. Next is the appetizer- chips, salsa & bean dip with a side of hair in the beans. The kid's fries came with a complimentary salt like. So much salt on these bad boys you'd think it was a cured prime rib. Chicken came out raw so that went back to the kitchen.  But my favorite of all the unpleasantries was the fact that I had to try & enjoy my meal with a stack full of dirty plates in my face the whole entire meal.  My girlfriend had a nice friendly chat with the manager & he comped our entire meal.

I ordered this, and seriously it did not taste like any other Margarita Chicken I've ordered. The beans, are suppose to be black, these tasted like baked red beans, the ones you get from a can.

72,caroline i.,"Sacramento, CA",44,2,,1.0,2015-11-13,"WARNING!! On Veteran's Day, my friends and I had the WORST experience at the Chili's location on Signal Butte in Mesa, AZ. Two of my friends and I went in for a nice meal and left angry and disgusted. It was slightly busy, but not crazy. We were told that we'd have three waiters helping us since they were sharing the area. That was pretty much the last we saw of anybody. Well, I did see our main server standing at the computer almost the entire time. My friend and I got the 2 for $20, both with chicken fajitas and an app of chips and salsa, and her husband ordered a steak. After watching 4 other tables being served their chips, we finally got ours. We got through the entire plate of chips and sat there staring at the empty bowl until we we were able to flag a server down (not the one who was supposed to be our main server, she was still at the computer) and got a refill. We finished that as well and then waited another 20 minutes for our meals to arrive. Neither of our fajitas were sizzling and both were barely warm. My friend's husband's steak was flat out cold. It was obvious they had been left dying in the window. Since we couldn't get our waitress's attention, we just ate. They no longer put lids on the tortillas and instead wedge a small plate in the container. After prying the plate out, I realized there was nothing between the bottom of the plate and my tortillas. That is incredibly UNSANITARY. I don't know what that plate was sitting on in the kitchen. I'm pretty positive there are health codes against that. We had to flag down another server to get refills on our water. It had been so long, the ice had melted and I drank that while waiting to find anybody to refil our glasses. The three tables that had finished and left before we got our food hasn't been bussed and we were starting at dirty plates during our entire meal. We finally found a manager and he just kept saying it was a busy night with a few unconvincing apologies thrown in. There were empty tables and booths from the time we arrived at 7 until we finally left at 9. It was NOT busy enough for that complete lack of service or cleanliness. When my friend's husband asked if being busy was a good reason for poor food quality and service, the manager said the numbers show it was busy. I'm sorry but a manager should NEVER mention the numbers, especially as an excuse to an upset guest. He didn't even care about the sanitation issues. Starting at other people's dirty dishes for over an hour, food that had clearly been left out, and having the bottom of dishes touching our food is just revolting. Add that to the lack of service and uncaring attitude, I will not only never go to Chili's again but will also discourage anybody else from going. As it is, I'm tempted to call the health department. The following day we called the location and got the same manager we had complained to. He said that he didn't remember talking to any upset guests the night before. When I contacted corporate, they just sent an automated email saying they were going to send us a coupon for a free meal (because we really want to go back to a restaurant that doesn't care about health codes).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mesa-6?start=60,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.404,2.12

7,Serge F.,"Mesa, AZ",20,13,,1.0,2016-01-03,"FOLLOW UP 1/3/16. Looking back at this I want to add that we did indeed call the restaurant. The manager came on the phone & explained that she had a protocol, questions she had to ask for their insurance company in case we sued. I told her we were not going to sue, but she asked them nonetheless. She concluded by saying she wanted to mail me some coupons for 2 free meals. I gave her our address, but she NEVER SENT THEM. Phoney half-job doer manager. Next we were given an online form to fill out for the Maricopa County Health Department, which we did. I'm changing her rating from 2 stars to one star and we WILL NOT BE BACK, and it's a shame. We always liked Chili's, because they have a very wide spectrum menu. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ((ORIGINAL REVIEW FOLLOWS: Went there about 1:45 PM Sunday, 13 DEC 2015. They said it'd be a 15 minute wait. My wife went straight to the restroom and the table closest to the restrooms was clean and empty. After about 20 minutes they showed us to that same empty table. WHY DID IT SIT EMPTY FOR 20 MINUTES? Work slowdown? Or not enough help to get the job done?  The place was very crowded and the staff was plenty busy. I had a California Turkey sandwich. Excellent taste, well prepared, My wife had the Quesadilla EXPLOSION Salad and it was as good tasting as it was aptly named, because it caused her an intestinal explosion of diarrhea and stomach pain. I'll phone the restaurant and let the county health dept know as well. Maybe it's too close to Chipotle (which is next door). Maybe their bugs have migrated west that 75 feet or so to Chilis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mesa-6?start=20,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.34,2.12

He then proceeded to go to the next table to get their order before placing ours. No big deal seen it before but over heard the next table ordering full entrees for dinner. We then proceeded to wait almost a full hour before I lost my patience and asked for the manager when the table next to us got their food and ours was nowhere to be seen and the waiter had not stopped by to check on us or give us any kind of apology for the delay. When the manager showed up I told him we were leaving and not paying for anything just as our simple order finally showed to the table. He tried to apologize and COMP our meal but I didn't want it due to this being the second time the service by the bar area staff had fallen.
