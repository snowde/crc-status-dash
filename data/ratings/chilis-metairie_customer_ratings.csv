The hostess told us it would be 20 minutes without offering the bar area. He only offered after I said something about the three empty tables.  Which by the way, were dirty.  We waited a while before I went to the bar to find out about our server, who turned around and said she would be with us in a minute. Only to have ignored us most of the time, especially after I had a talk with the manager. The  loaded baked potato soup sucks.

50,Eric S.,"Arabi, LA",29,173,74.0,1.0,2012-10-01,"Bad choice going here, Mediocre food, disorganized service. My wife has bugged me to go here for a long time, she worked in the Food Service industry when she was younger. I don't like Chain restaurants and this place is exactly why. When we pulled up the parking lot was jammed packed, they share the parking lot with a couple other business so its always busy. We didn't wait that long to be seated, our waitress took our order right away, which was great because we were starving. We decided on a sampler appetizer a Maple Bacon cheeseburger and a Monterrey Chicken. Our appetizer came out fairly fast, but you could see why, the portion size was small, but tasty. I had ordered a water and when i got it it had a couple lemons floating, I hate when they put lemon in the water without asking if i wanted lemon aid i would have order it. We were not finished our appetizer when our food arrived. At first glance booth looked great. so we hurried the last of the Potato skins so they could take away. I took a bite of a fry and it tasted like it was dipped in Maple syrup as i checked my plate i seen a pool of syrup, i asked my server did my cheeseburger come with Maple syrup she told me the bacon was cooked in it.  My bun was soaked in the syrup, i didn't want her to make another i seen the Movies where they spit in your food if you complain. Then i notice there wasn't onion rings on it either, i usually don't bitch about my food, but the main reason i ordered that cheeseburger was for the bacon and onion rings since i normally don't get to eat it. My wife's chicken seemed ok but she said her food wasn't that hot, plus she asked for Broccoli but got a ear of corn. Our waitress seemed very busy or at the end of her shift, it was hard to get her so we could get more drinks. By the end of our meal we finally got her and she ended up putting our drinks in to go containers. After we left my wife called the manager to complain, we didn't do it in the restaurant so he could fix the issue. The Manager offered free meal coupons but i didn't want them and after that he didn't seem to care much. So overall our experience kinda sucked and not worth $50, i seriously doubt i will ever eat there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-metairie?start=60,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000004

The servers are ok (depending who you get), the food had no type of season, especially the sirloin steak. You'll have to put some steak sauce to make it have some kind of taste.

48,Mildred T.,"Metairie, LA",0,9,3.0,1.0,2014-05-05,"90% of what I think of a restaurant is service. Walked into Chili's on Vets about 6 pm and no one was on duty at the hostess stand. It wasn't at all busy so we went to the bar to be seated. There were several dirty tables and a few bar stool type tables that were available. Usually we don't have to wait very long to get a table bussed so we waited. When the waitress comes out, I asked if she would clean the table so we could sit down. Her reply, "" When I find time."" Ok, so nasty remark. I go to the bar to sit down and instead of her cleaning the table we were waiting for she passes us and I tell her, ""Thanks"".  She in turn tells me, ""I'll get to cleaning the tables when I find time."" And she also tells the bartender so as to eliminated us from ever getting service. No manager on duty, no one to see the attitude the servers have with their guests. We walked out and went to Austins. Boy what a complete difference and so glad we left. BTW we usually tip no less than 20% and sometimes more.

It was very obvious that the whole section was reserved just for those with children.  Strike one chilis They put those cute tablets on the table however no one informs you that your charged to play games on them, granted 99 cents isn't going to break the bank, it still would be nice to be informed which i was not until i saw my bill, also things where pretty dirty in there another thing not use to seeing.  Strike two chilis and last but not least, the chicken tenders with the awesome breading that you cannot get anywhere else are no longer there, however they are still called the original chicken tenders. I'm not a chicken tenders and french fries kind of gal however I have always loved the way Chilis did them, one big reason i would go there.

65,Lindsey C.,"Harahan, LA",14,15,30.0,1.0,2014-12-21,"I hate writing reviews like this but thats what Yelp! Is for. My boyfriend and I went to chilis last night at about 10 p.m.. It was a Saturday so the place was pretty packed but there were three seats at the bar so we decided to sit there. Upon walking up to the bar, there was a live roach sitting on the bar. The bartender walked up and we quietly pointed to the roach so she could fix the problem without disturbing the couple that was sitting right next to us eating.  The bartender screamed and said that she doesn't do roaches and acted like she wanted to hand the wet bar towel to my boyfriend to kill it. After a couple of seconds and a few dirty looks she decided to go get someone else to kill the roach. Another girl came in and wiped the roach, who was alive, off of the bar with the wet bar towel and shook it off in the trash. In my opinion she should have thrown away the towel but that's neither here nor there. Trying to be understanding we we're going to stay and eat but sit in a different location . As we were standing there waiting for them to clean us a table, I heard a loud noise from the back and could see under the saloon style kitchen doors that the chip scoop had fallen out of the chips and was laying on the floor. Two people walked past and didn't see it. Another girl walks past and kicks it across the floor. She immediately picked it up and threw it right back into the chip bin. No washing, nothing. It went from being kicked across the floor to back into the chip bin. We immediately got up and left and I asked to see a manager. The manager walked up to me and immediately started to apologize about the roach incident. I then informed her of the chip scoop situation and she honestly looked mortified. She asked me if I could identify the person who did it but I couldn't because I could only see the bottom half of the kitchen under the doors. She explained that she would be throwing the chips away and making new ones and having them wash the scoop. But I didn't stay to confirm it actually happened. This was the worst experience I've ever had at a chilis. We usually eat at the chilis on Manhattan which is much cleaner. We will not be going back to this Chili's on Vets.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-metairie?start=40,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001,1.6360000000000001

67,Dawn H.,"Metairie, LA",12,12,5.0,3.0,2015-02-11,"Everytime my husband and I choose to eat here, we wait at the hostess stand for at least 10 minutes.  I noticed we will wait to be seated even when they are not very busy, so it may be a temporary short staffing issue.  Lately, we have been calling our food in and picking it up in the To-Go Orders Counter.  They have really improved their to-go food service in the past months.  My husband and I take advantage of the two entrées and an appetizer deal for $20.00 about once a week.  We always order the ribs which are the best thing on the menu I think.  They have a honey chipotle sauce that is sweet and spicy.  For our appitizer, we order the southwest eggrolls.  You have to ask for this appetizer when getting the 2 for $20.00 deal because it is not listed on the menu.  The wait time on to-go orders is usually 30 minutes if they are very busy so I suggest calling your order in first then going to pick it up.   This way you can get an accurate wait time from the waiter/waitress taking your order.  I always tip 20% on to-go orders. They are good at double checking your food to make sure its all there before you leave.  If you do not feel like cooking dinner during the week, I suggest trying their to-go service.  The food prices are reasonable and the food is always still warm when I get home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-metairie?start=40,1.84,1.84,1.84,1.7720000000000002,1.8400000000000003

The ""spinach"" queso dip was just queso with three spinach leaves in it.  And the spinach gave it kind of an odd taste. The salsa was not good.  To me at least.  Just tasted artificial. The fajitas were AWFUL.  The sliced steak pieces were incredibly dry and tough, the chicken tasted processed, and there was absolutely no flavor to the dish.  Terrible.   The burger and fries were actually good, however.  The fries were well cooked and seasoned.  It seemed like the portion of fries was a bit small, but whatever.  And I ordered my burger medium rare, but it came medium/medium well.  Disappointing, but at least it tasted ok. And the margarita was exactly as described, and pretty good. Finally, the service.  Our food took FOR-EV-ER.  And my burger came out a full 10 minutes before her fajitas - WTH??  And after the waitress brought the burger, she came back and even asked what my SO had ordered.  So I don't know what the heck was going on. Ugh.  Avoiding this place at all costs from now on...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-metairie?start=20,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.284,2.0

I got the honor of watching everyone eat while my food was nowhere to be found. I did get it some time later. No one was apologetic or accommodating.

7,R D.,"New Orleans, LA",0,49,11.0,2.0,2017-09-18,"Made the mistake of giving this place another chance, and it was still pretty bad. $3 ice teas (ridiculous!) and $6.50 for an appetizer of 8 onion rings?! My ribs were dry and the french fries, the few there were on the plate, were stale.. My companion had the sirloin with avocado salad and she liked it. Other person had the Caribbean chicken salad and thought it was OK too. Still overall I did not enjoy the meal and for $58 plus tip for lunch there are much better places you can eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-metairie,1.56,1.56,1.56,,1.5600000000000003
6,Karina L.,"Dacula, GA",1,13,6.0,3.0,2017-10-07,"Pretty on par with any Chili's I've been to, however, our waiter in particular could have been more attentive. She would take our order and drop the food off never coming back to our table again. This location is clean and the food was good, although I wouldn't recommend the new chicken crispers and waffles. The waffles are so sweet it's literally sickening.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-metairie,1.64,1.64,1.64,,1.6400000000000001
2,Janine M.,"Metairie, LA",45,63,19.0,4.0,2017-10-19,"I was here yesterday around 3:30 with my son who is 12. We enjoyed ourselves and the food. There was no wait as there weren't too many people in the place. I ordered the chicken quesadilla off the lunch menu and my son ordered the new Big Texas ribs. They were right, they do have more meat!  He got some fries and I love potatoes so I messed around and ordered loaded mashed potatoes. Well my son didn't complain. He ate all of his ribs and had BBQ sauce all over his face because he obviously wasn't playing. He didn't touch the fries, I tried them and I think they had been sitting too long. I discovered my loaded potatoes were powder so after picking at the toppings I left them alone. My son also ordered a mini molten lava cake for $2.49. We thought it was going to be an itty bitty thing and boy were we surprised to see it was pretty large. I wonder what the regular one looks like. It must really be big. Well I helped him eat it and it was tasty. Had I known it was going to be so large, I would have ordered my own since I greedy.  Our waitress was friendly, and efficient.  She checked on us and got whatever we asked for with promptly.  I come here sometimes during the week for lunch and the last time I was here a month or so ago, I ordered the quesadilla. I was very pleased with it then and was just as pleased yesterday to find out it was just as good. I love when I go someplace and get something that I like and can come back and find it is still just as good. That is rare, but Chili's seems to have the knack for that.   I plan to return soon but I think I might try something else on the menu because so many things look good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-metairie,1.76,1.76,1.76,,1.7600000000000002

The restaurant was still pretty full but there were empty tables. We were asked to wait 5-10 minutes so they could clean the tables off. No problem! We actually sat down at our table ten minutes later. I was pleased.  We didn't have to wait long for our server. She greeted us right away and got our drink order. She was nice and helpful.  The restaurant floors were dirty because of the lunch rush, but the staff actually started to clean the floors!  This has not been the case in the past per my experience.  Our appetizer was delicious! It was chicken crispers and waffles. It was part spicy and sweet. I highly recommend getting this dish! Wow!! My cheese burger was cooked medium. It was actually cooked correctly. It was tasty too!  The fries were hot and fresh.  I was definitely pleased! Keep up the good job.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-metairie,1.88,1.88,1.88,,1.88
1,Johana M.,"Kenner, LA",0,11,2.0,1.0,2018-01-06,"coming on a saturday night my family and i already know it's going to be busy. i work in a restaurant, i know how saturday's go! it would be 30-45 minutes to be seated- so we wait. an hour and a half later (why we didn't just leave is beyond me) we are finally seated. we are greeted by our waitress who takes our very lengthy order with no pad... look you don't impress me by not writing down our order, it actually makes me nervous.  WRITE IT DOWN!!! SPECIALLY ON A SATURDAY!! we order three alcoholic drinks- the triple appetizer thing- two salmons and a hamburger. we knew the wait for food was going to be long but our waitress didn't even come check on us. finally the manager came to see how we were doing. when we talked about the drinks he came minutes later with them in hand. woo!!! something in our bellies.  45 minutes later- no appetizers. 10 minutes later she comes out with our food. lady, where the H E L are our appetizers? of course she forgot to put it in! THATS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DONT WRITE THE ORDER DOWN! anyway we finish our food in seconds (cause we were starving). and had to wait 20 minutes for the check. and another 10 minutes for her to pick it up. wow, i always give waiters the benefit of the doubt but this was next level horrible service. she checked on us 2 times while we were there for an hour and a half. [[IMPORTANT]]. JUST. WRITE. DOWN. THE. ORDER. i would leave her $0 if i could. but my dad was feeling nice and gave an $11 of a $70 check.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-metairie,1.84,1.84,1.84,,1.8400000000000003
