This place gets packed and for good reason. Everybody knows about the 2 for 1 drinks and their free salsa chips (depending on if your waitress is a bitch or not). Usually when they serve you, for example, Cranberry and Vodka....they'd usually give you a ridiculously gratuitous amount of Vodka....I'm talking 'the bartender isn't looking as the vodka pours into your cup' amount of Vodka. Obviously that's a good thing!  I would've given it 5 stars, but it's always crowded and people know this....yet they keep going to these crowded places.

104,Alicia T.,"Hollywood, FL",134,96,32.0,1.0,2012-11-19,"WHAT IN THE WORLD IS WRONG WITH THE FOOD/MANAGEMENT HERE??!! Even though I'm in this area often, this is my first time at this Chili's and I will never go again.  My hubby and I stopped in on a Saturday late afternoon for lunch. We are really Chili's lovers and frequent other locations all over Dade/Broward (and the US). The place was packed so we thought we were going to have our ""regular"" tasty meals. NOT! All we ordered was a bacon cheeseburger and the Triple Dipper appetizer, neither one of us came close to finishing our meal, something just wasn't right and I didn't figure it out until some friends told me the following Monday that some restaurants of this stature in Miami mass produce their food on the weekend. A light bulb came on then because this was the WORSE Chili's location EVER. (same exact experience here as at the TGI Fridays at Dolphin mall, a complete and utter disaster). I guess they stay packed because of so many immigrants/international visitors to the malls in this area? Even the Hialeah Chili's was 10X better than this location.  We would've been better off stopping at McDonald's for a Big Mac, at least it would've been semi-fresh. If this place makes there most popular dishes and keeps them under a warmer (as it seems) the manager needs to be fired. I'd rather wait longer for a meal than get it in 5 minutes because you made it hours ago. Specifics below: Chips & Salsa: *sigh* the chips were not fresh, they were as stale as a workday is long. Bacon Cheeseburger: My husband is not a foodie, expert, or good on descriptions, all he knows is his burger (for the first time at any Chili's location) sucked and just didn't seem right to him, he left half of it on the plate and didn't even finish the fries. He lost his appetite.   Triple Dipper: My southwestern eggrolls were old and a bit withered, it was about 2-3PM and it looked like they'd been kept under a warmer since 11am (or yesterday?). My boneless honey chipotle chicken wings were SUPER CRUSTY as if they'd been fried a LONG TIME AGO and again kept in a warmer until I ordered them, then drizzled with sauce. No, you heard me right, DRIZZLED, not dipped, tossed or covered. That's how I could tell they were so old, they were naked.  They were like plain, crusty pieces of chicken. Some so hard, you could barely bite down on them. My burger bites? Oooohhh, do I even have to go there? The burgers were OLD! The bun was stuck to the cheese, and not because it was melted, but because it appeared they had been again kept under a warmer so long the cheese was welded to the bread, the sauce that comes on the little burgers was dried out, and the meat was dry. This place is a disgrace to Chili's everywhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-13?start=100,3.08,3.08,3.08,2.084,3.0800000000000005

Great food especially their beef fajitas which was my typical order. Truly inexpensive prices.  Always had great service. Casual relaxed atmosphere. Very, very busy which means very loud especially if you have someone's poorly raised kids next to you... Now they are just too popular and too busy to visit compared to other places within a 1-2 minute drive.

Well, this will be the last time and we recommend you take your hard earned money someplace else. We ordered the guacamole and although my finger was pointing on the menu to the guacamole we wanted, the server brought us the wrong thing. We decided to keep it anyway. The appetizer had a side of guacamole and salsa with chips. The guacamole had chunks of guacamole, one so big that it took literally 2/3 of the cup. I called the server (Marino) to complaint about the dish. He stated that I didn't specified which guacamole I wanted, seriously??? So you are telling me there are two kinds of guacamole being offered and you took it upon yourself to order whatever seemed appropriate without asking me to clarify which one I really wanted, disregarding the fact that my finger clearly was pointing at the guacamole dish advertised as being prepared by the table and serve on a big dish?? Anyway, he called the Manager who comp the appetizer since we didn't even touch it. I ordered a draft beer (blue moon). Again, the server didn't even mention there was a happy hour, so he brought two glasses without asking if I wanted both at the same time. Therefore after drinking the first glass, the 2nd one was already warm. We also ordered chicken wings and Cajun chicken pasta. Again, nothing especial on either dish. In a nutshell, stay away from this place. They have problems starting at the top. One last point; NFL playoffs were playing on T.V., however only the bar area have T.V.s.

I'm sure they were very busy.  I finally get there, extremely happy that I was going to eat some amazing food that I had been craving all day. I'm checking my order and I see that I was given fries. Hmm. I don't remember asking for fries. I tell the waitress that I asked for southwestern mac & cheese. So I'm late, and they STILL get my order wrong. At this point, I'm very annoyed.  I take a seat, waiting for my mac & cheese. THIRTY MINUTES later, my first order comes out. Have to wait another FIFTEEN for my second order to come out.

12,Alexandre H.,"Miami, FL",257,253,121.0,3.0,2016-07-23,"This is a difficult review to write. I have come to this Chili's several times, and almost every time the overall experience is very different. I believe the problem is that they are almost always very crowded, working beyond capacity, which puts a lot of pressure on the serving and cooking staff. Service quality depends a lot on the person that will serve you. I have had great service, and I have had awful service (to the point of almost standing up and walking out without paying my bill, and screw it all, in anger). The overwhelming crowds create parking problems (most people park at Walmart and walk over), cleanliness problems (yes, the place does not feel clean, as a restaurant should always), frequent errors on orders (ours was wrong last night), staff that is missing in action, and the place is extremely loud, making it hard to even have a normal conversation with your table mates (wait till the kids start screaming, then it feels like a nut house). But ok, got the bad off my chest, here's the good: - Prices are good, and they have specials like 2 entrees for $20, including fajitas, great deal. - Drinks are always 2-for-1, order a beer get two mugs, nice ($3.79 Bud Light, 2 mugs) - The place is fun, if you are younger than me - Most staff members do they best to control chaos, and I feel for them. Kudos to those that keep their cool and try their best to serve well. - Food quality and taste is above average, I never had a dish I didn't like. So, here you have it: if you are ready for a hectic and noisy experience, with good food and decent prices, and can be forgiving if things don't go exactly as you wished, this Chili's the ticket. But if you want quiet and great service, with excellent dishes but a bit more expensive, go to Tony Roma's up 87th ave close to 33rd street, it is the ideal alternative.

57,Jose V.,"Miami, FL",84,10,,1.0,2017-01-28,This place is pretty bad for dinner. Came here last night and the waitress we had was pretty bad. She assisted us with what we needed which was good. But the table that was across from where I was sitting at was her group of friends. She gave her friends basically VIP treatment. My table would order drinks and it would take like 10-15 minutes for us to receive them. But her friends would get their drinks in 5 minutes. She would also sit down and talk to her friends and there would be times where she would take sips out of her friends alcoholic drinks. I'm sorry but working in the restaurant business drinking on the job even just a little is unprofessional. Also my girlfriend ordered a Bloody Mary to try it out and she didn't like it. She asked the waitress if we can possibly exchange it for something else and she said she wasn't gonna charge us for them but she did. Wouldn't come back here again. Go to the dade land location they will actually take care of you.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-13?start=20,2.36,2.58,2.58,,2.492

2,Damian R.,"Miami, FL",22,53,1.0,1.0,2017-07-16,"This is the worst restaurant i have ever been to. My wife wanted to come here because for some unknown reason she seems to enjoy these chain restaurants which are all awful. Any who, lets just say it started out wrong from the moment we walked in when the hostess was the most unenthusiastic person i have ever met, if you hate your job that bad then just quit. When my wife, our daughter, and i were finally sat the waitress took our order but was impatient with us to the point that she walked away without letting my wife decide which sides she wanted and what food we were ordering for our daughter. Our food came out but not our daughter's, my wife had to request it again. Isn't it restaurant policy for the kids food to come out first? She then had to request for her apple juice which they also forgot. Back to my food, the ribs were cold so i had to tell a waitress that passed by which called a manager and he quickly swapped it out for a ""fresh"" half rack. The ribs were room temperature so clearly they're just sitting in the kitchen under a light since they came back within a minute. Another problem with the ribs were that i asked for them to be dry rub and they came out with barbecue sauce, i didnt complain about that. Then the waitress gave us a refill of our iced tea without ice so the tea was hot. Clearly this waitress needs to be retrained because wow this was the worst service i have ever received. I dont remember her name if she even said it. All i remember was that she was a black girl and we were on table 22. I actually tried calling the store twice to ask for her name but the people that answered didnt want to give me her name and hung up on me when they were going to ""put me on hold and ask"" I will never ever go to another chilis simply because of this experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-13,2.24,2.58,2.58,,2.444

Our waitress was nice but our food took over an hour to come out. Other tables, including some that came after us, got their food and left before we got served. At first thy brought only two of the three meals. The third meal took another 30-40 minutes and by then wasn't even wanted. The manager had no proper customer service communication skills and although he comped PART of the bill, he wasn't sympathetic whatsoever. If you ask me, everything should've been free.

46,Crystal M.,"Miami, FL",259,14,15.0,2.0,2017-08-13,"Usually I love Chilis. I used the app to wait in line, Uber's here and when we arrived we got seated right away. However the food took long, when it finally arrived it was cold and it was sloppy. I ordered the triple dipper appetizer as an entre with the south western egg rolls, the cheddar bites, and the honey-chipotle crispers. When it arrived the dipping sauces were spilled all over the food and mixed in together. We also got the new smoke house combo that looked delicious on the menu. It came with house smoked BBQ ribs, hand battered chicken crispers, roasted sweet corn, home style fries, chili-garlic toast, and garlic dill pickles. When it arrived the corn was plain and 1/2 the size (unlike the picture and description), the ribs barely had any meat on it. Bones with BBQ sauce. Honestly it seemed like the kitchen people really didn't care what product they were putting out. The bar was worse, we ordered blue long islands, and it tasted like cleaning products. Honestly horrible. I usually don't like sending things back, but the drink was truly unbearable. We stuck with the regular long islands, which wasn't too much better. Our waitress was great though, she honestly had nothing to do with the bad experience we had. I would rather drive further and go to a better chilis than come back here; 10 mins away from me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-13?start=20,2.36,2.59,2.59,,2.498

43,Emma S.,"Hollywood, FL",0,7,8.0,1.0,2017-09-27,"Let me start of by saying that I been a customer of the company for YEARS! Tonight was the WORST experience ever! Unfortunately I had to put 1 star if not would be negative infinity stars. Let me walk you through the night.  We walked in, the host sat us in a closed area, which we found out and had to move. I did not mind since it was extremely cold and the new table was perfect on temperature. Out waiter I believe her name Yeisel Do (name on receipt) came took out order. It's four of us, we order a burger for my brother, my grandma ordered sirloin WELL WELL DONE -NO SPICY-my mom had the fajitas trio -NO SPICY- she also asked to substitute the rice & beans for mash & broccoli since for dietary purposes she can't have the spices mainly in the rice, she said she would ask her manager, I also had the fajitas trio -NO PEPPERS- yes to SPICY. Long story short, food came my brothers was perfect. Grandmothers stake was NOT WELL DONE. Mines HAD PEPPERS, no spicy. My moms NO PEPPERS AND SPICY. I had to ask a DIFFERENT waiter to take my grandmothers steak back because ours was NO WHERE TO BE FOUND. As far as my plate & my moms I personally was just over it at that point, we did not realized we had each other's plate until later on, my mom did not felt the SPICY until about half way into the plate, was building up at which point she needed water, I made a signal to our server, to which she acknowledged me but never came by instead went to the table next to us to get payment, I was done, I stood up went to her and asked her for water for my mom, she says yes I'll be right over, as I am sitting down and we are waiting for water my mom told me where is she? And looks back only to see OUR SERVER having a FULL ON CONVERSATION & LAUGHING with other servers at that point I stood up went to the bar and told a girl that i just wanted water at that point we are just leaving and never coming back, I told her about the food and how they are allergic to spice she asked what table I was on, showed her and went back to it, she then brought 3 cups of water.  I paid and we left.  I do have to say that girl, I wished I had gotten her name, the one that took us the water, was the only right person there, at least that attended us other than the GUY (not our server) that took my grandmothers steak back. Only those 2 were good. It's really a shame! I never had a problem like this or even close at any chilis. They just lost me and anyone remotely close to me as a customer.  Just HORRIBLE SERVICE, from the extra charging for the food, (which I gotten substituted before, today they didn't want to it, because they didn't, but I know could be done) to the unprofessional treatment by the server, confusing all the foods and sides, to the lack of attention for simple WATER!  I only hope my mother is okay, and that simple mistake from their end doesn't harm her because it that turns out to be the case, that would be a different ball game, for Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-13?start=20,2.44,2.58,2.58,,2.524

They took our order, and we waited another 20 mins for our food.  By the time our food did get there, it was our main course with the appetizer.  I mentioned the appetizer, they took the main course back and finally brought out the app 10 minutes later.  You could tell it was just sitting there - not sure if someone forgot to bring it out or what but we ordered the white queso dip and the guac on top was brown, the pico de gallo was dried out and the cheese itself was almost hard rather than saucy from being under the warmer for so long.  The then brought out our meals.  You can tell this was all also sitting under the warmer while we finished the app.  My pasta was dry despite asking for extra sauce and they didnt garnish the pasta with any cheese like other locations do.  My father's burger was soggy and the pickles inside the burger were hot and soggy instead of crisp -- again, this is from sitting under the warmer. I asked for a coke, but they completely forgot.  I would usually go for dessert, but I just wanted to leave this place so I didn't order any.   I've been here other times and it was never this bad, but this experience has made me not want to return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-13,2.64,2.63,2.63,,2.6340000000000003
