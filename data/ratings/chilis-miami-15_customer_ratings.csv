A girlfriend and I ordered a combo platter or appetizers plus 2 soups and 2 salads.  We were the ONLY ones at the bar, and 20+ minutes later I asked the bartender if he would mind if he brought ANYTHING out to us.  He said he was simply waiting for platter first and he would go get something,  Funny thing is, he never asked us what WE WANTED, you know, the customers???  We both wanted our soup or salad first, basically anything that was ready.  We had to repeatedly ask for things like a ""lemon"".  He often disappeared for large periods of time then told us us someone else would be checking us out, he is leaving for the day.  Overall the food was good  - and we got served some large portions for the $6 meal combos, etc. - great value.  I would just ask for better service - I felt like an annoyance trying to get my food or check - and I won't return for that either :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-15?start=60,1.736,1.736,1.736,1.736,1.736

Since I'd never really spent any time in the city, I spent most of the day on the hop on, hop off buses and exploring Miami. It wasn't sweltering but still pretty sunny and muggy.  Since I know Mexican is pretty easy to swing with my dairy allergy (minus the cheese and sour cream) I decided to head to Chili's in the Bayside Market. Oh, and I love margaritas. Really love. They have an indoor restaurant and an outdoor, covered bar area. I opted to sit at the bar since it was outside and less noisy/crowded.  The bartender was awesome - he had a good sense of humour despite being very busy serving all the bar customers in addition to the tables in the bar area. The El Presidente margarita was ample and yummy - I should know... I had two. I also had the tequila grilled chicken, which was divine. Cooked well and tonnes of food, as usually happens in the States (I ended up taking the beans & rice back to the hotel and eating for light dinner). All in all, a fun experience and exactly what I needed when I was feeling pretty tired and overwhelmed.

My husband suggested Chili's. Immediately I got scared......but I figured it's an average chain restaurant, how bad could it be? We arrived and were told it was a 20 minute wait, however to sit at the tables by the bar there was no wait. We sit down to a dirty table that my husband had to clean himself. Then I notice the TVs outside playing the Heat game and the lightbulb goes off as to why my husband wanted to eat here....Anyway. We waited and waited for a server and were told that we had to go up to the bar and order? I order a Margarita, which is served in a dirty glass with a huge lipstick stain, Nice! My daughter had a pineapple juice which took about 15 minutes to receive and was basically thrown on the table by the bartender. When the bartender re-made my margarita in a clean-er glass he just through it up on the bar, with not even a word, a nod, something so that my husband knew that it was for him. We sat there for a minute and decided it was in fact mine, so he went and grabbed it. At that point I said, ""We're outta here!""  As we were leaving we saw some sun-burned tourists to go up to the bar and ask where their server was, and saw the bartender yell at them that they had to order from him....I still don't understand why tourists continue to come to Miami....

We arrived around 6:45ish. The event began at 9pm. We left the restaurant at 8:30 (I checked). Service was very slow. There was a crowd forming at the entrance and the hostess would randomly disappear to clean tables. Lots of fans who were going to attend the event at the arena were showing up.  Our waitress was really nice and kept apologizing for the slow service. We understood that and were very kind to her. I am sure others were giving the poor girl a hard time.  They seemed under staffed. Thing is, if you know there is an event at the arena, and you expect a large turnout, make sure you have enough staff on hand. The food was ""meh"".

18,Nathan H.,"San Diego, CA",3,4,21.0,1.0,2013-06-17,"I've been to multiple Chili's before over the years and have never had a problem. However, this particular Chili's had issues as soon as we walked in the door for an early dinner. It smelled of some strong cleaner throughout the restaurant that lasted the entire meal. We waited for a few minutes at the entrance before we were greeted, although a waiter was counting out all of his tips at a front table and looked at us occasionally. He must have just got off his shift and was wearing just his undershirt. He enjoyed yelling to multiple employees across the restaurant but never called a hostess over. After eventually being seated by a nice hostess, that was the last friendly service we received. Our waitress took a long time to reach us which fortunately gave us time to place our full order. She did not smile once although she did get close a few times, which was almost encouraging. After bringing the wrong appetizer, she actually argued with us a little before telling us that it would take some time to make another one. Wasn't that big a deal for it being a little longer since it was only corn guacamole. When she brought it out (which consisted of setting it on the table without a word), it was brown--probably didn't take that long to make a leftover batch...  Besides having to ask multiple times to ask for our first glass of water (thought that was the first thing served), our meal actually came out quickly and didn't have any problems. We did get to have the tip-counting waiter come back (thankfully with his work shirt back on) and clear our table. He did manage to almost drop a steak knife on my girlfriend and didn't say a thing. Fortunately we were able to leave, keeping most of our tip money with us. We did get the satisfaction of watching the previously absent manager actually start yelling at the employees for other issues throughout the restaurant. Would have recommended he done that behind closed doors and not in front of all the customers, but nothing really surprised us there anymore.  Alright, that's enough complaining and I'm sad to say that wasn't all the problems we had. Altogether, the main course was good, but service was slow and forced at every corner.

63,Adam R.,"Miami, FL",56,44,1.0,1.0,2013-06-19,"Words cannot describe how terrible this place is. I went for lunch with some co-workers, and we got there at noon exactly. It took 10 minutes to be seated, but then the waiter promptly came and took our drink and food orders, so I thought things were looking up! I WAS WRONG. After he brings us back our drinks pretty quickly, the waiter disappears for 40 minutes. I seriously would have considered calling the police and sending out a search and rescue squad, IF I WASN'T SO ANGRY ABOUT IT. We finally get our food, and it's your standard Chili's food, nothing better or worse. By the time we're done here, it's nearly 1:30. That's completely unacceptable considering that if this place were a person it would be embalmed, and its main customers are probably professionals who probably have to get back to the office with some sort of haste. HOWEVER, besides the poor service and mediocre food, the place was incredibly grimy. The waiter(s) were profusely sweating (and they work indoors!), and everything was dirty: The silverware, our glasses, the napkins, just everything. It makes me dry heave when I even think about this place. I think if a person kidnapped my family, and forced me to eat there again, I'd have to write a tearful goodbye letter to my family because nothing is worth going back here.

One problem with him is that since it was so busy, he wasn't able to go to our table a lot. The hostess/server that help figure out the seating problem, helped us when he was unable to.  The food was very good! The steak was tender and had a lot of the flavor! The onion rings were delicious and crispy.  The fries, however, was a bit cold, but the hostess got us a new batch of fresh ones. I was very pleased with her and our server.  The view was also very nice!

Our waitress came to the table and took our orders that was not a problem. I ordered the white spinach queso and egg rolls. The spinach queso came to the table with absolutely no spinach I told our waitress as she was standing there and actually stirred the queso to show that there was no spinach. The waitress said ok I'll let them know. She walked away and not even 3 min later she came back with another spinach queso that was so watery we needed a spoon. I told her this was not what it should look like and she agreed and I asked for the manager. The manager walked by twice and finally after I called him he came to the table I explained the issue and he said he would personally make the dish. Not long after he came back with another white spinach queso and yes there was spinach and it was super cold. That was very odd since he came out with a cover on the handle and the pot was cold as if it never been used. How is that possible did u really just combine both of the dips that were incorrect and bring it back to the table. I sure hope that wasn't the case.

We asked her to wipe it off and another server came over wiped it very poorly.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-15,1.76,1.76,1.76,,1.7600000000000002

Please enjoy this Chili's for the views and not for excellent food or service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-15,1.84,1.84,1.84,,1.8400000000000003
26,Andy V.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",937,1412,6952.0,3.0,2018-01-04,"Sadly as it is, I don't really expect much when I come to a Chili's, ESPECIALLY when a Chili's in such a tourist trap like this Chili's is. Hungry, not caring what to eat, we came in here one evening after a very long day of travel. The location is on the second story of the Bayside Market in Miami. It was somewhat busy, but we were able to be seated immediately. We ordered the unlimited chips and salsa which is always the thing to get. the chips are $3.99 and you get as much as you want. What more could you ask for? Our server was pretty good. He had a lot of tables so you could tell he was running around like a crazy person trying to take care of everyone. I ordered their chicken tenders on waffles. Sorry, I don't know the technical name, but either way, it was much better than I expected. The waffles were thick and sweet with a kick of spice from jalapeños topped with their chicken tenders coated in their famous sauce and placed next to is a side of syrup. And don't forget the fries. The portion was huge. Four pieces of chicken and waffles. I could only eat half of it and had to take the rest home with me, sad, I know, but it made a great snack for later. I like being able to pay for the meal at the table on the machine to get in and out quicker. Overall, was a much better experience than I thought, still not amazing, but definitely okay in my books.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miami-15,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92
