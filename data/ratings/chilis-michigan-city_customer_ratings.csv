19,Lynn S.,"New Buffalo, MI",0,24,,3.0,2012-09-26,"I'm not sure if the management has changed, but this place is starting to do a 360! Service used to be HORRIABLE and food was just as bad. I stopped going for a few years and recently returned because i didn't feel like going to the Valpo Chili's that night. To my suprise, service was great and so was the food! I hope it keeps this up!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-michigan-city,,,,,
0,Tom V.,"La Porte, IN",3,215,202.0,4.0,2013-05-11,"""My wife the coupon Queen had a coupon to buy one entrée and get one free. She had a classic turkey sandwich on Texas toast. She says it was very good. I had a burger with Swiss cheese and it was very good. The cheese was melted as it should be. We both had fries and they were crispy and golden as fries should be. We asked for a sample of the salsa and chips since we never had them here. They provided a full serving. The salsa was too sweat and had no fire, none at all. When I mentioned that to the waitress we were not charged for it. We were surprised that we would give them 4 stars but this trip they earned it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-michigan-city,,,,,

18,Theodora H.,"La Porte, IN",0,52,,2.0,2014-04-16,The workers were nice. My beer was a touch warm and watered down tasting but it did the job. Our appetizer was sinfully greasy (but I decided to treat myself) and my steak was quite good. The only problem is my stomach started hurting after we left last night and it still hurts today (could have been the greasy appetizer. I don't eat that type of food very often). Is this what food poisoning feels like?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-michigan-city,,,,,
14,Dennis S.,"Three Oaks, MI",0,2,,1.0,2014-08-26,"It's been a few decades since I ate at a Chili's, and now I remember why.  I was very disappointed with my visit.  The food wasn't anything to write home about, unless you were going to give your ex one of Chili's gift cards as payback for years of bad cooking.  My meal was a pain for my senses.  The presentation was mediocre, and the taste was best described as bland and boring.  I think I felt my taste buds dozing off a few times.  The service was terrible as well -- truly abysmal bordering on nonexistent.  The waitress never came by to ask if I needed anything or to refill my beverage.  It's going to be a long time, if ever, before I return to this franchise.  :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-michigan-city,,,,,
15,Dave W.,"Michigan City, IN",642,29,4.0,2.0,2014-12-16,"why even bother having a ""to go"" door if I am going to have to walk-thru the whole place and then wait at the bar for 5 minutes to get my luke warm ribs. #fail",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-michigan-city,,,,,
17,Frank R.,"Michigan City, IN",10,3,,4.0,2014-12-22,"I have a good experience every time I go here.  The place is clean and well kept.  The wait staff is courteous and friendly.  Food is what I would expect.  It's not over the top great,  but it is good.  I've never had a bad meal here.  I go here about once a month.  Order something you know you will like and you won't be disappointed.  Also,  good coupons from email club.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-michigan-city,,,,,
10,Brock K.,"Michigan City, IN",0,4,2.0,5.0,2015-02-03,"Wonderful service from waiter laurel at lunch, Always positive and happy and always on top of every request. Drink and food lunch specials are what to do! Always quick as well!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-michigan-city,,,,,
11,Ruba S.,"Oak Lawn, IL",0,9,3.0,1.0,2015-03-03,I had a horrible experience at this chilis. I normally love chilis but the food they served me wasn't even on the menu! The salad was left over salad and even had the butts of the romaine lettuce and pickled jalapeño! On top of that the waitress was extra my rude! I was too disgusted to eat anything that was served to me! I advise u to never go to this chilis save ur money!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-michigan-city,,,,,
3,Doug G.,"Atlanta, GA",184,250,144.0,2.0,2015-03-13,"It's a Chilis, so the food is what you expect...tasty, hot and delivered fairly quickly.  Service on the other hand was lacking. I waited upwards of 15 minutes for any interaction with my server at two different points in my meal. And the kicker was, there were only 4 tables sat in the entire place. You could actively hear the bartender and waitress arguing about clean glasses, which was...well, awkward. They seemed to focus on that more than their patrons.  Easily my worst experience, service wise, I've ever had at a Chilis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-michigan-city,,,,,
12,Brandon D.,"Michigan City, IN",0,8,1.0,5.0,2015-06-06,"Listen, if you're in Michigan city just eat here. Michigan city doesn't have much to offer but you can't go wrong with chilis. I eat here at least twice a month and I even have a waitress who remembers what beer I drink and that type of stuff counts when I'm spending money to eat and relax. Not only is the service good i would also pay someone to tell me they can't find something to eat because they have everything from burgers, steak, ribs, salad, and even Mexican food! Enough reading. Go eat.. Now!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-michigan-city,,,,,
7,Mike H.,"Michigan City, IN",0,24,,5.0,2016-02-20,Tasty every time and service has always been good.  I love the bacon ranch quesadilla myself,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-michigan-city,,,,,
6,Charlotte B.,"Logansport, IN",24,33,27.0,5.0,2016-04-28,"Great food. We asked to change some things and add others. , There were four of us, the order was correct and the food arrived in a timely manner food was both hot and very  tasty. Wonderful service. Pleasant waitress very attentive. Will visit  back again next time we are in town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-michigan-city,,,,,
5,Thom J.,"Michigan City, IN",14,11,1.0,3.0,2016-07-23,"Nice atmosphere good service, but the food is only ok and a bit overpriced for the size of the portion and the tortilla chip are way to salty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-michigan-city,,,,,
8,Noelle C.,"Kenosha, WI",0,3,,5.0,2016-08-05,"We stopped here on our way back from IN to WI.  Actually we placed a To Go order on our phone.  Our kids have allergies, and when my husband went inside to pick up our order the waiter told us everything they did to make sure our orders were allergy safe.  We are super impressed at the level of care that went into filling our To Go order.  We love Chili's and will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-michigan-city,,,,,
1,Erin K.,"Lansing, MI",9,42,104.0,2.0,2016-10-16,"Yuck yuck yuck! Man chili's has gone downhill :( Used to be one of hubby's favorite restaurants but even he admitted it that it's done. I would put it on the same scale as Ruby Tuesday and probably worse than Applebee's .... and that's bad! The food tasted gross and hurt our stomachs, hubby got the chicken sandwich which he said used to be super good and didn't even want to finish it. I got the app sampler, the sliders were gross! And stale! The egg rolls barely had any filling. The kids weren't eat their burgers.  The service was meh. We won't ever be back :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-michigan-city,,,,,
9,Amrutha G.,"Chicago, IL",0,10,2.0,3.0,2016-11-30,"Meh, an ok restaurant when you are hungry and ready to eat anything. Service is a hit or miss, I have visited this location a numerous times and never received the same kind of service nor have I seen the same waiters again. This review is especially for the last nights dinner we had. They had a promotion of 3 items for $10 which also included the mini molten lava dessert so I decided to try it. Ordered the chips and salsa for appetizer and fajitas for main course, and also ordered the onion rings as hubby and I were sharing the dinner fajitas. We also ordered Margaritas for me and Blue moon for hubby. Our waitress was Pamela and she made sure we were doing ok once the food arrived and came back multiple times to check on us. She also went above and beyond to take care of our dietary needs as hubby cannot eat tomatoes and she brought additional cheese as dipping sauce for him. Overall a good experience, especially because of Pam and her great service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-michigan-city,,,,,
4,Ronda C.,"Taylor, MI",0,6,,2.0,2017-04-24,"This place is the worst I've ever been in, the service is poor and the staff is unfriendly and that won't even accommodate you on any orders that you place. I wanted to order chicken wings and could not get the flat pieces, because I only like the flat, they could not accommodate me! wow!!! Will never eat there or go back there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-michigan-city,,,,,
2,Kristen B.,"Michigan City, IN",94,1,,2.0,2017-07-27,"Poor experience today for lunch on our way through town. Took over 45 mins to get our food after we ordered, had to ask for drink refills, then was charged for $1.99 entertainment fee (we didn't use the kiosk on the table) and over charged for a kids side. Would not recommend it this location, not crowded during lunch should have been a red flag. Also needed to be dusted along the back of the booths!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-michigan-city,,,,,
