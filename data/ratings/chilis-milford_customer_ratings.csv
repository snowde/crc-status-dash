7,Katie C.,"Boston, MA",180,587,92.0,3.0,2012-01-05,"We're not talking gourmet food, but after driving hours in the rain on I-95, Hubs and I stopped here to catch a quick dinner and rest before hitting the road back to Boston.  For travelers, it's very easy to get in and out of.  And it's across the street from a mall, too.  Even better. Our server was really nice and very quick.  We split chips and salsa (not homemade, I know, but it hit the spot) and ordered two entrees.  We finished our entrees quickly, as if we had never ate before.  We joked with our server that we were on the road heading home and needed to get off the road and out of the rain.  He kept hooking us up with more chips and salsa.   The service was great, and the food was just okay.  However, you can't have high expectations to begin with!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-milford?start=20,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998

12,Rob S.,"Monroe, CT",1,5,,1.0,2013-08-27,"The Pizza my son ordered was very under-cooked, my wife's Ribeye was paper thin, over cooked, and way over seasoned. Service was so slow I just wanted to leave cash on the table and leave.   I don't expect much from Chili's, and I have had a pleasant experience in the past, but that was years ago...

8,Sebastian A.,"Queens, NY",113,8,,1.0,2013-09-03,"A recognizable and run of the mill franchise restaurant with a large and attractive menu with decent variety. I ordered a sirloin steak with mashed potatoes, broccoli and nachos. The nachos were okay, and the mashed potato with bacon was the best part of the meal, but the meat was overcooked when I ordered it medium, so I drowned it in A-1 sauce to make up for the lack of flavor. The worst part though was the broccoli, which was far from fresh and had brown rings around the stems and some of the head. Any other chain restaurant is a better choice if you're looking for a cheap casual dining experience, so skip Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-milford?start=20,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116
2,RJ S.,"White Plains, NY",5,204,6.0,3.0,2014-01-17,"This Chili's is about the oldest casual dining chain place in the Orange/Milford corridor, dating back to the late 80s I believe. Despite the age, the place looks pretty decent - they've done a good job of maintaining the place over the years. For what it is, it's fine. Had the chicken fajitas in my recent visit - a little light on peppers and the chicken was sliced too big and could have been blackened a bit, but overall it was ok. I did like that there were some beer specials that saved me a couple bucks a beer. I also liked the music they had playing, a mix of rock and pop, and at a just-right volume.  If you're vegetarian, be warned that options are limited: one pizza and one flatbread choice (neither of which really scream Chili's to me), and then what might be your best bet: any of the burgers with a black bean patty (which is actually pretty decent, and I'm not even vegetarian).   One major bummer - they discontinued one of their other signature items, the ""Awesome Blossom"", which was the breaded and deep fried whole onion.  Certainly nothing great, but if you have to eat on the Boston Post Road, this is one of the more solid options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-milford?start=20,2.38,2.38,2.38,2.38,2.38
31,Rachael B.,"Milford, CT",118,113,27.0,4.0,2014-03-12,"I'm updating my review to 4/5 simply because of how above and beyond the customer service was for making up for incredibly poor visit just a few weeks prior. Bryan, the manager, is wonderful. He sent out a letter to us apologizing for the subpar service we received from the waitress we had that night and even noted that the it wasn't a busy night, so the food coming out cold and our waitress playing magician and disappearing half the night was inexcusable. He sent us some Chili bucks and after coming home late one night, we decided to stop by and see if he was there. Sure enough, Bryan was working and I thanked him for his kind letter and the apology, as well as the Chili bucks. We sat down and had a waitress who was attentive from start to finish without being overbearing. We didn't have to ask for refills on drinks, she knew to put in our daughter's food before our two meals, and was just overall jovial and pleasant. The food came out hot, with no issues and everyone was happy. The whole experience was a total 180 from what we were exposed to previously.  Bryan assured us that some of his staff were put on notice (not just our waitress) and some were even fired (not her either) and that everyone has since stepped it up. It was incredibly refreshing to see someone step up and initiative to get things done and make it right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-milford,2.416,2.416,2.416,2.416,2.416

28,barbara r.,"Garden Grove, CA",109,13,4.0,1.0,2015-04-11,"Worst Chilis I've ever visited! Servers celebrating being stoned, calling other customers bitches for cheap tips, and general smack talking (that's what the kitchen is for!) Clean up your act, work as a team and for goodness sake pretend you want to be there, if I could give less than 1 star I would. 10 minutes to get extra tortillas so we could share the fajitas? I could have made them from scratch faster. Worst service ever! And I made a point to let the manager know what's up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-milford,,,,,

6,Nick R.,"Milford, CT",0,8,,1.0,2016-01-06,Chilis used to be the place to go. Now the service is always slow and the food is pretty nasty. Only thing they have going for them is the good chips. Last year I was here at least once every two weeks and now the past four or five times I've been the service has been so slow and the food has been gross. Burgers cooked way to much and the other meals not to good either. Also the last time I went I wanted soup but they were out of EVERY soup! How is that possible? Will not be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-milford?start=20,,,,,

19,Maya P.,"Los Angeles, CA",142,229,467.0,4.0,2016-04-10,"I tend to steer clear of franchise restaurants. Microwaved food doesn't really appeal to me. But I've been coming here lately --usually late night-- for drinks and dessert. (I can't speak on the actual meals because I haven't tried them recently.) But that skillet cookie with ice cream is one of the best things I've ever tasted. The cookie is rich, buttery and comes out steaming hot with a heap of vanilla ice cream on top, drizzled with fudge sauce. It's amazing. For ten bucks you can get a margarita mixer that's good for 4 cups. It's a great deal for a chill night out. I usually sit in the bar area when I go and the last two times I was there we had an attentive waiter that really looked out for us. She was awesome.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-milford,,,,,
30,Big Drew M.,"West Haven, CT",0,6,,1.0,2016-05-06,"I went there recently and the hamburger was a hockey puck after 45 minutes of waiting. The kitchen manager, Sharon/Shannon--whatever. She gave me an attitude and said she was really really busy. Then why come over to the table? She scared my daughter because my daughter is not accustomed to adults speaking to her daddy in a demeaning way. My daughter buried her head into my wife's side. The food is mediocre and on one occasion a few months ago my wife got a very upset stomach over their veggie burger. My complaint to the Connecticut Department of Public Health has already been lodged against this store. Their kitchen is disgusting . They did a huge remodel---but a pretty cover on a old bag of dirt does not make the dirt bad edible STAY AWAY. SAVE YOUR  MONEY. Try Wood and Tap down the street. They have internal accountability--.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-milford,,,,,

We waited almost ten minutes at the front. Two more groups came in, they waited too. We left and honestly have no reason to return. We would've liked to have tried the food... but went to Red Robin instead and had a great meal and outstanding service! Sounds like Chili's of Milford is taking a quick kamakazi dive!

I have been here a million times, the food is what it is not bad and the servers are friendly for the most part but today Owen went above and beyond the duties of a host. He was very helpful and very attentive to my two year old. Not many people go out of their way to entertain a child because let's face it kids can be annoying when you're trying to enjoy your food but Owen was great. Talked to my son even went out of his way to put on the TV for my son. He was great!!!  Thanks Owen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-milford,,,,,
27,Devin S.,"West Haven, CT",0,11,,3.0,2016-08-27,"The queso is excellent, the quesidillas are just ok.  I think the staff needs to be more informed though.  I went with my best friend who is a vegetarian, and she asked if the black beans had any beef/chicken stock or meat.  She was assured they were vegetarian. Luckily, a table next to us leaned over and told us it was not true.  The woman at that table was a vegetarian, and she was told that there was beef stock in the beans by a different server.   This is a problem, because vegetarians can have bad reactions if they eat meat.  I don't think servers should guess, and if they really don't know they should just admit they are not sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-milford,,,,,
32,Liz A.,"Stratford, CT",0,3,,2.0,2016-10-21,"My boyfriend and I have very rarely eaten at Chili's but lately we've been on a kick. Over the course of several weeks Chili's has failed to prepare our food as we ordered it, both in restaurant and as Chili's To Go. I hate to complain about menial things but after tonight it's just getting ridiculous. I think the workers need to not be so careless when preparing food. Time and time again it gets irritating. Thankfully the workers have always been helpful, except for once when we addressed the mistake and the woman told us that was how we ordered it, until she saw she was wrong when she looked at our receipt from our mobile order. Definitely take my advice and check your to-go orders before leaving.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-milford,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56

Our order was messed up twice. I always order the Texas Cheese Fries and they came doused in cheese and barely any French fries. We actually had to turn the food over to find the French fries. It was covered in jalapeños after I specifically said ""no jalapeños"". My soup arrived only after I reminded my waiter that I ordered it. Dirty dishes were left on the table for way too long.

Asked again for that. One napkin per person with burgers. Burger was over cooked and the fries were way underdone. Soggy and limp.

Chicken was a little oily but the rest was good. My daughter had the trio fajitas. Excellent! That said our waitress was terrible. She was not attentive at all. I had to wait ten minutes for a refill on my soda. When she did finally came by she grabbed my glass and said want a refill and then quickly walked away before I could answer her.

14,Daniel F.,"Bridgeport, CT",0,6,,5.0,2017-10-02,"On my daughter's birthday, I visited Chili's after walking out of the Applebee's nearby following the most horrible customer service I have ever received.  We were greeted by a very nice young lady at the door who took my name. She was clearly working very hard to find each party on her list, and smiled at everyone as they were escorted to their table. We were served by Laura, who provided a wonderful experience, and greeted us immediately as we sat down. Everything was brought very quickly and correctly by our very friendly server. It was clearly a very busy Saturday night, but Laura shined. We explained to her that our experience at Applebee's earlier in the evening was horrific, and she certainly made it a point to go the extra mile for us.  About midway through our meal, a young man who looked to be a manager came over and apologized to us about our experience at the other restaurant. He did not have to do this, and especially not on such a busy evening. Good on him for taking the time to come over and ensure we were enjoying ourselves.  Say what you want about ""chain restaurants."" The Chili's in Orange is an example of what families look for when they go out to eat on a Saturday night. Good food, great service, an awesome environment, and a fair price. Props to the staff here for giving us a terrific experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-milford,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52

Girlfriend had to wait 13ish minutes for bbq sauce. Then I'm the end just gave us everything free.... not worth it if I'm dying on the toilet.

Reseat yourself as you need to. The best time to go is when they are NOT busy, so the service will be better. Food is adequate, the quesadilla we had was very good, and the guacamole burger was decent. The server said the order took too long and he comped us with free French fries. Some of their servers can be real motivated and decent others as slow as DMV workers. Avoid the annoying table kiosk and the in-your-face survey it begs you to use.
