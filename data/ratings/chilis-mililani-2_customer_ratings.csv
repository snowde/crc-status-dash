192,Ava C.,"Honolulu, HI",163,31,22.0,3.0,2012-04-02,"Growing up down the street from a Chili's has probably contributed greatly to my obesity. GREATLY. But did that stop me from going? Hell no, Chili's is freaking delicious! I have ordered everything on their menu. Even the ""local"" plate. And all of it is tasty. It better be tasty, it all has 1000+ calories in it.  Over the years, it's gotten expensive. I remember the days when the Paradise Pie and Molten Chocolate Lava Cake were only $5.99. Now they're easily $10 each. I have had bad service and great service at this place. And normally when I point out an error in service, the server is quick to fix, comp, or discount. The most common mistake I encounter at this restaurant (unless they are purposely doing it) is putting applewood bacon on my burger that should have smokehouse bacon. I may sound petty, but there is a BIG difference in the price of the burger depending on which bacon you order. Personal Favorites to drown my fatness in...don't get me wrong, I am normally accompanied by fellow fatties who like to stuff themselves to the brims with fat too ^_^: - Queso & unlimited salsa/chips or Appetizer Trio to share - Honey Chipotle Chicken Crispers, can substitute side fries with any side - Unlimited soup & salad...which I order to try and fool myself that I am eating ""healthier"", but the dressing-drenched cesear and chicken enchilada soup are actually just as calorie-laden as a stick of butter. If your server is cool, they'll let you interchange salads and soups for tasting fun! - Cajun ribeye, covered in garlic butter, of course - Jalapeno Smokehouse Bacon Burger - Everything else.  *And NO it's not mexican food! Or even Tex-Mex food. Chili's is the perfect example of what Amerrrrrrrica does to mexican food. And then they stuff it with more cheese. I have noticed that people are complaining about crowds and slow service.  Chili's FATTY PRO TIP: Chili's implemented a ""call ahead policy"" years ago and I am surprised that not many people take advantage of it. If you frequent the restaurant the number is RIGHT THERE on the hostess stand. It is handy and useful! Especially if I am trying to go on a Saturday night at 8pm. Call them up and put your name on the waitlist before you get there. And then people get mad when you get seated before them even though they've been sitting in the foyer for 30min.  And when there are times that the wait is an hour more, I just call the Waikele Chili's, which is only 5 miles away, to check their waittime. And very rarely, if both are crowded, I'll call the Pearlridge Chili's which is only another 5 miles away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mililani-2?start=240,2.604,2.604,2.604,2.604,2.604
291,Lily B.,"Mililani, HI",874,538,1986.0,5.0,2012-05-15,"My favorite Chili's location on the island. Waikele has let me down several times lately and finally... no more! I will only go to the Mililani location, and each time I've visited, it has been great! Located in the Mililani Town Center in between Taco Bell and O'Reilly Auto Parts. There is parking in a private lot off to the side as well as in front. If you go for dinner, it could be very busy. We went during lunch and there was a ton of parking available.  I've been craaaaaaving a burger. I know there are many joints on the island that people will swear has THE BEST burger, but I find that Chili's has THE BEST burger I've eaten! YES, Chili's!!! So on Mother's Day, the BF took me to Chili's for lunch since I had my burger craving... Upon entering, there were 2 hostesses and a host at the podium. They all warmly greeted us, and I was given a pink long stemmed flower and a ""Happy Mother's Day""... awww how sweet!!! (hey, I am a Mom! To 3 babies! 3 four-legged babies!) We were shown to our booth and our server greeted us literally less than a minute later. Her name was Rainynoell. She was very friendly and efficient... and full of smiles! We started off with the triple dipper. The BF likes the southwest egg rolls, I LOVE the chicken crispers, and we share the bone in buffalo wings. The appetizer arrived fairly quickly and the items were hot and fresh. Ohhh how I LOVE LOVE LOVE the chicken crispers at Chili's!! For our main meals, the BF ordered the southerwestern BBQ big mouth burger with fries. It comes with cheddar cheese, onion strings, thick cut smoked applewood bacon, and he added the avocado. BBQ sauce is on the side. The burger was cooked to a perfect medium and it was JUICY!!! I got my FAVE. Mushroom swiss burger... adding on bacon and avocado with fries. The burger was HUUUUUUMANGOUS!!! It was cooked to a PERFECT medium and it was SOOOOO JUICY. There were SO many strips of bacon and a GENEROUS portion of yummy sauteed mushrooms. I was in heeeaavveeenn!!!  For dessert, we ordered the oreo molten cake, but to go since we were SO full! It's very sweet but VERY delicous, a must try for any Oreo lover (sorry, too hungry and forgot to take the picture at home!) Other servers came by to fill our strawberry lemonade (although only half empty)... YAY for teamwork!... as did a male manager... impressive! A female manager stopped by to see how our lunch went and gave us a $10 off coupon for our next visit, and she wished me a Happy Mother's Day as well.  All in all, EXCEPTIONAL service (from everyone), OMG YUMMY DELICIOUS HOT MADE TO ORDER FOOD (oink oink!), and an AWESOME experience for my Mother's Day lunch!! 5 stars!!!... and I will be back for more crispers and that burger!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mililani-2?start=180,2.836,2.836,2.836,2.836,2.8360000000000003

197,Nubia B.,"Laie, HI",4,96,28.0,1.0,2012-09-01,"Went here for a work lunch at 1100 this week.  When I walked in, no one came out to greet me for 5-10 minutes. (For background, the place was dead quiet.  A handful of diners already eating, and that's it.) Three chunky female servers were just gossiping away to my right -- even staring at me -- and not one came over to address the only customer at the podium. I'll stress that again: THEY WERE GAGGLED AROUND DOING NOTHING BUT TALKING, MADE EYE CONTACT WITH ME, AND THEN BLATANTLY IGNORED ME.  When a host finally came out, he didn't even address the obvious wait, much less apologize for it.  Customer service = garbage.  If I'm gonna pay to eat at your place, then you should really consider hiring people who care to serve people: just a thought. I'd've been happier holding this lunch at a local truck.  Even the food was (AT BEST) all right. Again: local food from a smaller restaurant  would've been comparable in price, but galactically better in quality.  AND IT WOULD'VE BEEN FASTER.  The pace here was GLACIAL with the food.  Considering how sleepy the restaurant was ... what's the issue? Only saving grace was the bartender (a girl named ""Sheera"".). Mixes a fantastic drink, but ... I'm not at this joint for the drinks, unfortunately. CONS: -- Rude, incompetent wait staff -- Mediocre food for Oahu prices -- VERY slow in showing up with food (even when the restaurant's nearly empty) PRO: -- The ""Princess of Power"" working the bar.  Love you, sweetheart!  Please consider a better venue to showcase your under-appreciated skillset!

I always get the steak fajitas.  They're pretty good, actually.  I've eaten fajitas at Mexican places and didn't think they were as good as Chili's.  I guess I just love the veggies it comes with.  When I'm not that hungry, I order that grilled lime shrimp.  Apparently, I can just order that as a side and then add veggies like broccoli.  Inexpensive meal right there.  I try to save room for dessert, because I just love the Chocolate Molten Cake.  So sinful.  I love it!

We sat in the last booth in the bar closest to the kitchen. This is probably the loudest seat in the whole place. Waiters tended to hang around the bartender and talk (loud) and from this seat I could hear a lot of the workers laughing and messing around in the kitchen (and dropping things.) Perhaps if they bothered the chefs less and worked, the food would get on the tables to the customers faster.  We waited a very long time for our food. So long that my daughter said ""Mommy let's just go home."" The food arrived and although it was nice and hot, everything was GREASY. The tortilla chips and chicken tenders that came with our Triple Dipper Appetizer were so oily that our fingers were shiny with oil after eating. Then came our fajita trio, the rice was also shiny with oil. The worse part about our experience was our waitress who just seemed like she was unhappy to be there. When she dropped off our drinks she responded to my ""thank you very much"" with a ""hmmm"". Same thing when I asked for more napkins and when my husband's soda was refilled. Most places I go to say ""you're welcome."" The only time she checked on us was at the end of the meal to see if we wanted dessert. I told her just a take out box and the check would be fine. She dropped off the take out box and check and I never saw her again. We waited and waited for her to come and pick up our check. By then the dinner had dragged on way too long so my husband and daughter went to the car to wait. Finally another server noticed me waiting and rang up my check.

First off, let me start by saying that it really sucks when you crave some nasty moz sticks and they no longer have them on the menu. :(  Oh well...Grilled Shrimp Tacos were much too filling anyways with the avocado and super spicy sauce. I pass on the Uncle Ben's style rice just because it tastes gross (blechhhhh). The kiddos split a full rack of ribs and they all seemed to love it. What kind of trip to Chili's would it be if we didnt save room for the Chocolate Lava Cake??? yes, I'll have one please!! I wanted it all to myself but I did eventually share with the fam. Sharing is caring, right??? Service was great and friendly...food was ok. Love the fact that everyone got a reprieve from Thai food.

I would even go as far as saying they are sparkly with enthusiasm!  So Boyfriend and I came here on Saturday night after a water logged camping excursion. We were literally just going to get salad (I love the ranch at Chilis), but our server made everything sound so yum! I ended up getting a watermelon margarita, the bf got a tall beer, and we split a triple dipper. Our choices were spinach&artichoke dip, and the two boneless chicken wing flavors. So good!

307,Kim A.,"Mililani, HI",6,34,13.0,2.0,2013-11-11,"Based on all our past take-out orders, this place is absolutely horrible. Why? They NEVER seem to remember to give utensils with our meals. Do we have to ask each and every time? For future reference, apparently, you do.  I do have to note that the FIRST time I ordered take-out from them, they included everything including utensils, so because of this, I tipped them because I was so happy that they got everything right.  Since it's take-out, utensils aren't a priority b/c we brought the food home anyway. But most recently, I ordered take-out for my husband's birthday. Didn't expect much as I only ordered 3 meals and asked for a birthday dessert (an ice cream, which they did offer). Basically, we waited half an hour at home before leaving so that our food would be ready. When my husband got there, he had to wait another 30 minutes (a little over an hour TOTAL). When my husband got home, as I mentioned earlier, no utensils. No birthday ice cream (it was supposed to be a surprise for him so he had no idea that it was coming). And my daughter's $6.99 kids meal basically consisted of chicken strips and a chocolate milk. WTH? Where's the side? There was none. I paid $7 for a couple pieces of chicken and small cup of chocolate milk.  I feel like the more things I order (usually, we order 2 meals, but thought this time, my daughter deserved her own meal since it was a special occasion), the more things they mess up; and a nice, dinner at home turned into disappointment.  I like Chili's. But this location has been pissing me off the more and more I order from them. I didn't even bother to call them to complain because my husband said they were busy and the lady at the counter was nice..... I listened to him, but as a paying customer, just watch out and double check your order before you leave.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mililani-2?start=200,2.92,2.92,2.92,2.216,2.92

We were greeted with a smile and waited for about 5 minutes before we were promptly seated. I guess the crowd outside was a large group waiting for a party.  Service was quick as our beers were frosty in the mugs. We all ordered the Triple Dipper plate. Oddly, we all had the same selections; sliders, artichoke & spinach dip and honey-chipotle chicken. The sliders were done just right, still a bit juicy but cooked medium-well, the chips & dip were okay, and the chicken was a bit over-fried. Good points were the friendliness, quickness and accuracy of service. The beer was icy-cold and quenched our thirst. Food was a bit boring and mediocre.

263,Kristin V.,"Haleiwa, HI",31,2,,1.0,2013-11-17,"We come all the way from Honolulu (used to come from Kaneohe) just to eat at this location. My now husband (at the time we were engaged) went into anaphylactic shock twice in one night from eating dairy as he is allergic to it and made it known to our server. The manager (a nice guy of Asian decent) came by and helped us out that night. Since he was willing to help is, we decided to keep coming back to this particular Chili's. We have come back several times to this location as they fully understood my husband's allergy and catered to his needs. We were there this past Friday and our server then was bad, but Alika made it all better. We have had her before and is an EXCELLENT server and kept going back because of her. She smoothed things over on Friday night. We then take our good friends to Chili's today and had the worst experience ever and will never go back because of our NEGLIGENT server. DO NOT BE SEATED IN CHRIS'S section. He got upset as someone else started our drink and appetizer order as he was nowhere to be found for the first 20 minutes we were seated. It was almost empty today and service should have been better. It gets worse from here. We order our food about 25-30 minutes after being seated and we all knew what we wanted. My husband was the only one who got his food about 30 minutes after we ordered it. It still took another 20 minutes after his food to come out that we started questioning Chris and we also asked Alika and she was great, but our server did not care (we learned later he is a LIAR). He says he made a mistake with some if the food (he stated he needed to come clean and say he  put our food wrong in the computer). We accepted his apology and it wasn't until an hour and a half later 2 other people (in our party of 4) got their food. I ordered the boneless buffalo chicken salad and finally when my food came out, the chicken was cold. He had neglected bringing my food out when it was ready. I finally got my food again and decided I wanted it in a to go box as I wanted to leave. Alika had come back to the table to inform us that our whole bill is going to be free and taken care of by Chili's. About 20 minutes after that, my food I had boxed was finally brought back to me. Then Chris asked if we wanted anything else. Since it was on Chili's we got 3 molten cakes as a to go order. It took about 15 minutes and our server came back to say that the cakes were in the oven and almost out. He said he checked himself. Which that was a lie. If we were doing a to go order, they would pack it up and let us heat it up at home. We finally got our cakes and left. The server was laughing as we were leaving. Alika came up to us one last time to apologize over and over. We got to our car and looked at the molten cake to notice that it was not cooked and our server Chris has LIED once again to our faces. So if you want rotten, horrible service of an ex military man who is a liar and hates everyone, he is your man to see. It is sad that they lost loyal, good tipping customers due to one negligent worker who does not care about his job. The manager was nowhere to be found during this whole ordeal and I don't think he cared either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mililani-2?start=300,2.88,2.88,2.88,2.18,2.88

The response we got was were putting it together. Which they told is about 10 minutes earlier as well. Before we could ask anything else the server answered the phone before assisting further.  It took a fellow employee to hold her hand and pull out our order from the heat rack. Which by the time we got our food everything was cold. Ergo how long was our food sitting there who knows. Also not only were we waiting for 20 minutes over the expected time,but they gave us the wrong soup in our order. I don't mind the no utensils went home to eat regardless. My advice, if you get take out, hound them about your order. Don't be afraid to ask it's their job.

Right?  ""Well for the 2 or 3 years I've worked here that's been the case"".not delivered in a way that could be described as anything but rude.  We asked the table next to us how much they paid for chips and salsa, they didn't!  We still gave our server an awesome tip since she's new and this rude assistant manager has nothing to do with her service.

So when we were finally seated, the chips that they served us were all broke up pieces. When we asked our waitress for a new basket, she glared at us...seriously? We ordered our food, got it like 45 minutes later, and was maybe checked in on maybe twice. If we wanted something (refills, ready to order,  more chips), we pretty much had to whistle her over.  Lighting in there is really poor as well. There's a blinding light-bulb about 2 1/2 feet above your head, and it just hangs there. So you're pretty much eating with the light in your eyes the whole time.  Finally, the alcoholic drinks were NOT alcoholic drinks at all. We ordered a margarita, and it was sweetened so much, that you could have thought it was a virgin.

After about another 15 min, all of food came out, except the waitress notices after she had put the platter in front of my mom that the wings were bone in  and mom had ordered boneless. She took the entire platter back into the kitchen, leaving my mom with nothing to eat for another 10 minutes or so.  Keep in mind we did not complain once to anyone but a gentleman named Nate came out again and said he is apologizing for the kitchen and staff and is comp'ing our food. This has NEVER happened where they comp'ed all of our meals before, we were shocked, since like I said we never even complained once because really we were having fun with our nieces and shrugged off all the time/waitress mishap. We ended up only paying for the drinks and I think maybe our dessert.   I'm honestly shocked by the amazing customer service that Nate gave to us and another table next to us.

I was impressed with how she got down to the tables level and how she handled some of the tables. These are just some things I noticed last night!

I have always enjoyed the fajitas as it was historically enough for two people or just me, haha. The last few times I've been there I have noticed that the amount of meat is roughly half of what it once was. The sides changed too. You used to get a plate with a generous scoop of guacamole and sour cream, a pile of lettuce, followed by cheese and pico de gallo. Now they have gone to a visually impressive tower with tiny cups of the garnishes. It's visually impressive, I admit. Having said that, I am far more interested in quantity than I am in their deceptive little children's size cup of cheese and guacamole for my fajitas.

They told us a table had freed up, and didn't want us to wait too long, so the hostess asked if putting a chair at the end of the table would be okay to accommodate five of us. It's not my ideal setup, but I am a hostess too and feel bad when asking if a chair is okay, so it didn't bother us at all. Our server, Kevin, was phenomenal. He noticed our sunburned faces and suggested aloe with lidocaine (oh boy did it help!) and then suggested other places we had to check out on the island from hiking trails to snorkeling coves.

One time some coworkers and I went and just had the table side guacamole. It took forever just for the the waitress to lug the cart out. We kept asking and she finally came out and made it. I must say it was absolutely delicious! But then another time stopped here after work and asked for the table side guac, and they said they didn't have ripened avocados, only the pre-made guac which was disgusting. The enchiladas I ordered were the worst I ever had!!! Absolutely gross. The chicken they use in enchiladas, flat bread, quesadillas, etc is not fresh at all. It's those fake chicken pieces that have a rubbery texture. Also service is always bad. Every single time I've had an issue with being seated.

My family waited at the table for over 15 minutes just to br briefly greeted abd told they were really busy. Umm ok.... i get it. Ive been a server but 15 minutes to greet?! At least have another not so busy server bring waters over.  There was a free queso for uding the Yelp check-in which was way cool.  The food was average. Nothing special and exciting. I mean cmon its Chili's.  After waiting for an extra Ziosk my kids were pleasantly entertained. As a mom i swear those things are worth every penny!!!

The rice on the other hand was HARD n MUSHY..There was no in between :((...My fiancé or almost ALWAYS orders the the rib eye but decided to try something different. He had the ancho salmon. He enjoyed the salmon for it was cooked just right. He didnt care for the topping on the salmon as he stated it wasnt his flavor, hehe. The chicken was a little on the dry side, but we didnt complain as it was already almost close of shift. Our waitress whom I forgot her name was great.

37,Kristi A.,"Honolulu, HI",106,174,267.0,5.0,2016-05-29,"Service and Location:  I went to Chili's yesterday with my boyfriend. The location is very convenient since it's located at the Mililani Town Center where there's plenty of parking.  The service was excellent. We went there around 5:30 pm and was told to expect a 10-15 minute wait, but we got in earlier since we didn't mind sitting on the bar side. It was packed on the restaurant side though.  Food:  ""Entrees"" My boyfriend got some burger with french fries while I got  the ""Make it a Combo"" option for $24.99/$25 which allowed me to get 2 entrees a side of broccoli and mashed potato skillet. Since I'm trying to lose weight, I opted out for the citrus-chile rice instead of the mashed potato skillet. For my 2 entrees I got Seared Shrimp and Ancho Salmon.  The seared shrimp was a little spicy on the mild side. It was perfectly cooked, but the spices-paprika and chile was kind of overpowering for my taste. The citrus-chile rice had little taste, but complimented the spices from the Seared Shrimp and Ancho Salmon.  The Ancho Salmon was my favorite in terms of flavor and seasoning profile. The salmon breast was perfectly cooked and had a moist inside, but crunchy exterior. The salmon was seasoned with chile and then drizzled with a spicy citrus-chile sauce topped with chopped cilantro and queso fresco. The cilantro and queso fresco helped break through the spiciness of the salmon which was nice.  My boyfriend gave me some of his french fries and they were kind of thick. It was seasoned with pepper but lacked salt. However when paired with ketchup, it complimented well with each other.  ""Dessert""  For dessert, my boyfriend and I got their cheesecake for ($7-$8) which was drizzled with a strawberry puree. The cheesecake slice was pretty thick and had a graham crust. It tasted decent with the strawberry puree, but I felt like it was average to me.   Would I go here again?  Yes, I really like the Ancho Salmon and would get it again (minus the shrimp). I really feel like $19 is kind of pricey for Salmon, citrus-chile rice, and broccoli, but the salmon flavor profile was definitely worth it. Plus the dish is only 590 calories according to their menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mililani-2?start=40,4.04,3.69,3.69,4.0840000000000005,3.83

This is our favorite Chili's, not because we're from Mililani but because the food is always great and the service is on point..  Chili's is a great family restaurant. They have an awesome menu for the keiki (kids) and pretty sweet HH and lunch specials!  It's mandatory to get the chips and salsa and with your checkin on Yelp you can get a FREE Queso and chips with bottomless chips and salsa! L O V E ! I'm addicted to their Quesadilla Explosion Salad, I order it without cheese in the salad. To me it just taste wayyy better! This salad is a perfect combination of so many different flavors! It's sweet, tangy, & spicy! You've got beans, corn, peppers, tortilla strips, moist chicken strips! It's just awesomely amazing! Mm mm mmmmm!! Each table comes with a kiosk which you can order off of, play games on (small fee, great for kids), search for deals, and pay your bill! Super cool!  If you ever have room for dessert indulge in the molten cake! B O M B !!!! Specials on different flavors change throughout the year. I never tried one I didn't like. It is huge and definitely shareable! Paradise pie was another fave of mine but they longer have it - boo! Jk!

Well that's what it says on our receipt. Came here with my husband cause when we were in town by ala moana  he already knew he wanted the molten lava cake his favorite. Anyways we came in got seated right away, and I thought he told me his name was John, so I'll call him John. He came over introduced himself got us drinks. And gave us time to look over the menu. All the while he had maybe a party of 12-15 teenagers right next to us. You'll get why I told you this later. Anyways my husband likes the table side guacamole and was so happy that we ordered it. He added a lot of bacon and lime which my husband hasn't tried it that way before, and he ended up liking it. Came time to order our food, and then we both wanted to eat a salad and I told him about the chili I saw and we both thought on it for a while. We couldn't make up Our minds, John then came back and helped us, he even split our salad in two. So we could share. We both got, our chicken. I wanted grilled, and he wanted it Fried. The plates were so full. Ohh my god! And he was super friendly and fun. He went above and beyond for us. Even with that party that was next to us. Seemed like insanity cause they all got separate checks, but he kept his cool And made jokes with us or even just a casual conversation. It just made us both of us very happy:)  we'll be returning soon, thanks John or Christopher:)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mililani-2,4.08,4.12,3.56,3.8280000000000003,4.104

We weren't sure on what to eat so decided to split the dishes and only eat half... when the dishes came out he had got them split in the kitchen and plated up individually. I thought they were full portions the plates were so full! As I have dietary requirements of no dairy one of the chili bowls he brought out had some cheese on so without question he went and got another. Then on to desert... the Molten Chocolate Cake!!

We got an wings as an entree and since I checked in got more food stuff like free chips and cheese! We also ordered their cookie and and ice cream! We just came by for a quick bite and it was delicious ! The place is nice and clean.  We came by because it was convenient and glad it turned it the way it did.  Loved their different stuff they have on the menu now since it's been a while since I've been to chili's!  We will gladly go back especially for Happy hour ! Such god deals Monday-Friday around dinner time,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mililani-2,4.04,4.13,3.724,,4.094

27,Michelle A.,"Mililani, HI",39,4,,3.0,2017-11-29,"I come here all the time and the service is usually great but they seem to get the side orders wrong all the time. They either forget to bring it or give the incorrect one. The biggest issue I have is their take out orders. I called ahead to have an order ready by 6:40. Husband got there and they made him wait an extra 40 minutes because his burger wasn't ready. He gets home and realizes that the burger isn't even in the bag! I check the order and confirm it's missing so I double check all the meals. Sides were wrong and the fries were basically a few pieces (5) for two orders. Checked the receipt and they only gave the one without the description, just the total. The manager was nice enough to comp the meal and do everything over. The counter lady was explaining that it was due to the trainees working that night. I get that mistakes happen but a trainee is under the supervision of the trainer right? You're supposed to double check their work. Don't just hold that person responsible. The issue was not reading the screen correctly and placing them in the bag.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mililani-2?start=40,4.24,4.1,3.772,,4.156000000000001

Our burgers came w/out pickles, why?....they ran out. Fries came to our table cold. AND, ordered the Molten Lava, and. waiter came back and told us...sold out!

42,A P.,"Mililani, HI",12,6,1.0,1.0,2017-12-04,"First of all, I frequent this restaurant on average 2-3 times a month. I've always had great service and able to overlook small issues and still enjoy the meals. Managers should come to table when something is sent back right? It didn't happen this night, tables were open and no wait to be seated. Even more reason for management and servers to touch tables throughout service right? IDK. Anyways, My wife's steak comes out rare, when ordered medium. Server asked for us to check, and she agrees, ya - that's rare I'm sorry I'll send it back. Meanwhile the entire family finishes meals and steak (small) is nowhere to be found. Plate comes back, steak is over cooked and dried out now and slapped back on the same plate. Taking a rare steak of that size to medium does not take 20 mins. Sorry to bother you, may I ask for a box? We have to go now. No true apology or attempt at service recovery in my opinion when I'm only told the obvious - sorry you have to take your food to go now. Still tipped my server as it wasn't her fault, but not happy with this experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mililani-2?start=20,3.92,4.03,3.764,,3.986
1,Jon T.,"Honolulu, HI",12,28,3.0,5.0,2017-12-10,"My wife made a take out order then sent my son and I to pick it up.  Unfortunately when I brought it home my PREGNANT wife noticed that none of the sauces were included...god help me. She called to complain while I returned to pickup the sauces.  To my surprise the hostess advised me that the Manager Koa wanted to apologize in person. His apology was heartfelt, sincere and very genuine; he also afforded me a few coupons.  The wife called again and said the chicken was over cooked so I got sent back for a 3rd time smh. Koa is a great asset to this location and salvaged this rather inconvenient experience. In this world that is saturated with dining options Chili's can rest assured that my family and I will be returning. Big ups to Koa, mahalo for going out of your way.  Sincerely pregnant ladies husband.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mililani-2,3.92,4.03,3.764,,3.986
24,Jen M.,"Mililani, HI",0,4,,2.0,2017-12-11,"Placed a To-Go order over the phone. I was told it would take 20 minutes. When I got to the restaurant they said they were waiting on my chicken and salad (which was pretty much my entire order). After waiting an additionally 20 minutes (so 40 minutes since I placed my order), I went up the counter to ask why it was taking so long. They said they were finishing up the order and just waiting on the kids order of mandarin oranges. A few minutes later my food was ready. Once I got out to my car, I checked the food and noticed one of the sides was missing. So I went back in and waited longer for them to get the side. The chicken was also slightly burnt. Any time I've gone in and sat down, the food and service has been fine. This was the first time I've placed a To-Go order at this location, and probably the last.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mililani-2?start=40,3.84,4.0,3.756,,3.936
41,Andrew L.,"Waipahu, HI",440,3,,1.0,2017-12-21,"Picture this. 1:03pm, pretty darn empty restaurant, us and one other table in the section we were in. Christmas music playing and the smell of margaritas lingering in the air. I sit down ready to order one of said margies. Greeted by our server who seems to not have been enjoying the Christmas spirit in the air, as she was grouchy looking. Maybe she's worried she'll get a lump of coal next Monday? Regardless, we saw her maybe three times throughout our entire meal. Each time equally as grouchy looking, which matched the level of friendliness. Anyway, my margie arrived (by 1:20pm) and I may be wrong, but I could've sworn there's supposed to be tequila in a margarita. Either there was none or I've become immune to the flavor and smell of it (both are plausible mind you). Overpriced food shows up (by 1:38pm), chicken tenders for me and burger for my beautiful wife. Sadly it was just meh, (the food, not my wife, she's definitely not meh). I make better burgers at home. So, needless to say, this lunch just reaffirms why I don't go to Chili's anymore. Wanted to give them another try since they ""revamped"" their menu. Yet another throne of lies. Meh food+ meh service + tequila free margarita = this snarky review. Save your money, save your taste buds, save your Christmas spirit. Come to my house instead, at least there's a friendly face cooking good food and tequila in the margaritas.

0,April K.,"Honolulu, HI",113,112,920.0,4.0,2018-01-07,"This is cont. from last review 3rd for 2018 UPDATE to my UPDATE: I am adding back one star for service because the food tonight was meh.  The food... Our queso came out cold and had to be sent back and reheated. My husband's ribs also came out cold. They made a whole new dish and by the time it came back out we were all done with our food and he ended up packing it to go. My bar burgers were on the bland side and rather dry. Now for the service... Our waitress Christine was awesome! She kept up with my family of swillers (the 3 of them can each drink their own pitcher at dinner) making sure we always had a drink. She was very attentive even though it was a busy Saturday night. I really appreciated her upbeat and friendly attitude. The manager Janie made up for all the errors by comping my husband's meal and a dessert. She also came over and let me know that after discussing the call ahead situation with her gm they decided it would only apply to larger parties, so if your a family of 4 or less you can still call ahead for seating. The customer service here is why I will continue to come back. I'm sure Chili's will earn back that 5 star rating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-mililani-2,3.68,3.97,3.756,,3.8540000000000005
