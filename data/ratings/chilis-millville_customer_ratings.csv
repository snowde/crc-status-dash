20,Jessie L.,"Salem, NJ",43,28,,4.0,2012-12-29,"One of my favorite chain restaurants. I love the baby back ribs (though they've been dry on occasion), and the platinum presidente raspberry margaritas are great. Again, I'm not a huge chain restaurant fan, but for a casual dinner out in the cumberland county area, it's a solid choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-millville?start=20,,,,,
23,Jess K.,"Bridgeton, NJ",0,27,,3.0,2013-06-05,"The food here doesn't really jump out as a "" Omg this is so good. I'm gonna come here again"" kind of place. The options are good if your looking for something else out there besides the same old burger and fry place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-millville?start=20,,,,,
16,April T.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",2,2,,1.0,2013-09-22,"By far, this is the ABSOLUTE WORST service I have ever received in a restaurant. It was in the evening during the week when I went with some family members. At first, the waitress took a long time to take down our drink orders. Once we put in our drink orders, it took 20 minutes to even get them. At this point we already knew what we wanted, so we placed our orders. It took an hour to receive our food and not once did the waitress check on her table to see how they were doing.  It took her yet another 20 minutes after we received our food to check on us, at which point we were ready for our check.....which needless to say took another 15 minutes for her to process. The thing with this service is that the restaurant was not even busy, during those times the waitress was busy not checking on our table or ignoring her job, she was hiding in the back playing and joking with her co-workers. Which is completely unacceptable. The food was okay, only because by the time i received it, I was starving when it came and inhaled the food! I will never be going there again. Waste of time, money, and effort even going there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-millville,,,,,
10,Kathleen D.,"Richmond, VA",797,1719,11835.0,3.0,2014-01-25,"Two words: Gift card. This Chili's is right off Route 55 in the same shopping center as many other well-known chains. In turn, it can get busy with chain shoppers/eaters. I used to frequent this place in high school when I lived in the area. Today, it was not crowded around 5, so we had our choice of seating. Our server was very peppy, prompt and nice. My only qualm in the food delivery was receiving entrees a few minutes following the app. It's clean inside, looks like a Chili's, and food tastes like Chili's food. Spinach and artichoke dip = solid app to start with. It's creamy and they give enough nachos to feed a block. Chicken bacon ranch quesadillas = enough leftovers for a second meal is always a plus in my book. These came with salsa, sour cream and another dip that I couldn't pinpoint. All good! It's been many a year since they removed those chicken sliders from their menu, and I still miss them each and every time I enter a Chili's (...which is slim to never unless I'm not the one paying, but that is beside the point!)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-millville,,,,,
15,Mikee R.,"Murphy, NC",88,973,97.0,3.0,2014-03-12,I can't really say anything bad...  I knew what it was going to be like before I even walked in the door. It was the absolute same as most Chilli's. Warm soup. Burger which sat a few minutes before delivery. Old fries. At least they are consistent across the country.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-millville,,,,,
22,Am S.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",2,19,2.0,1.0,2014-03-30,"Everything has some weird ""fresh food"" seasoning... But it's really not freshly made.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-millville?start=20,,,,,
6,Robert O.,"Millville, NJ",53,577,284.0,3.0,2014-09-23,"Despite that horrible experience we have returned.  My son is such a picky eater and he will eat here.  It's weird. So there we were in the fourth quarter of the Eagles game the other day.  I asked to sit in the bar area so I could catch the game.  There was but one other table. The place looks the same, but there was a difference.  Apparently the menu had recently changed.  It wasn't really evident on the menu, but the food made a better impression.  The fries were delivered in a silver cup a la Red Robin.  All was served on a rectangular white plate.  The presentation of all our plates, including the egg roll appetizer was better. Service was a bit slow for how few people were in the restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-millville,,,,,
18,John W.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",0,6,1.0,1.0,2015-03-20,"Beware of the ziosk table top devices hidden charges. We ate their last night. The food seems to be the same quality with upgraded presentation. While browsing the menu our seven year old of course was playing with the tablet. We assumed it was similar to the free device at Buffalo Wild Wings. Our son never said anything about the device asking for permission to pay to play. When we receive our bill their is a charge for the games. We asked our server about the charge.  She informed us once you touch it, it charges you automatically but you have unlimited gameplay. The server showed no interest in removing the unwanted charge. I feel if you are going to offer this it should need adult approval. Chilis should keep these at the hostess stand and ask each customer if they want to pay to play so their is no confusion and customers don't feel scammed out of their money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-millville,,,,,
14,Stacy Z.,"Bridgeton, NJ",45,224,2.0,2.0,2015-05-07,"I used to go to Chili's all the time, but haven't lived near one in about 5 years, so I was excited to try this one on a recent date night. However, long wait + lazy service + just kind of blah food didn't really make me excited to come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-millville,,,,,
9,Victor R.,"Millville, NJ",111,80,5.0,2.0,2015-06-02,"After a couple of positive visits, I felt almost as though they were worthy of four stars. Today, I found out that they got rid of Sam Adams on Tap. So that leaves them with a mediocre local brew and four national lagers of the less than tasty variety. So, two stars down for them for a piss poor beer selection.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-millville,,,,,
11,Briana R.,"Millville, NJ",3,9,,1.0,2015-11-11,I found a hair on my plate before I started my meal.. I assumed it was mine and pulled it off the plate.. As I continued to eat I found another hair wrapped up with a fuzz ball. Absolutely disgusting and I will not be eating here again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-millville,,,,,
17,Shawn P.,"Mt Laurel, NJ",0,9,,4.0,2015-11-22,"We eat here at least 3 times a week. Drinks are good, food is consistent(for a chain) and we very seldom have bad service. Ask for their burrito menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-millville,,,,,
12,Amanda V.,"Millville, NJ",163,29,29.0,5.0,2016-01-23,"I've been here many times, the margaritas are amazing, the food always good.  I haven't had a bad experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-millville,,,,,
13,Brian R.,"Middle Township, NJ",0,1,,1.0,2016-08-28,"Once seated, waited more than 10 minutes for anyone to greet us, or take a drink order. Restaurant was less than half full.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-millville,,,,,
3,Bob M.,"Egg Harbor Township, NJ",14,18,,4.0,2017-01-29,"My entire life....was without meaning. I was drifting around aimlessly, working lousy jobs, driving a junker of a car an dating a girl that I knew wasn't into me. I suppose I just wanted to ""feel"" something. Truth is I was lost, but the moment I stepped foot in this Chili's....I was finally found. My life found true purpose. There had been this eternal darkness in my heart for as long as I could remember. However the moment I saw the menu.....I saw the light. It was a dim light, the first glimmer I've seen my entire life. It beckoned to me, and I was drawn to it like a moth to the flame. The world around me had slowed down and all noise had dissipated. It was just me, the menu, and the faint light shining into me. My vision cleared and I could finally see the words within the light. Corn on the Cob. I don't know what came over me, or what took over, but I impulsively turned towards the waiter with an overwhelming confidence and said: ""Corn on the cob."" I've never ordered just a single vegetable before, but something.....supernatural maybe.....told me to order it. Reality came back around me. A couple on a date to the left, a divorced father with his kids to the right....complaining about his drug addict ex wife from what it sounded like. It was all too much for me. I started to break into a sweat. A fear and taken over! ""What if isn't right for me?!"" I thought to myself. But it was too late, the waiter was already gone. I had a sip of my water, then two sips, and before I knew it the glass was empty. It was all too much, I felt like my head was going to explode. I was shaking uncontrollably at this point. I got up and went to the bathroom, I had to get away.  In the bathroom, I took a good long look in the mirror. The years of fear, pain, regret had taken its toll on me. I was beaten, but not out of the ring yet. It was then I realized.....I was afraid. But not of the corn of the cob, or the life I lived.  I was afraid of the change I was making. I lived a life of simplicity. Working just enough to fill my needs. Never once did I look outside my world and just.....wonder whats out there. Maybe a better job? Maybe a women who would truly love me? This was no ordinary corn on the cob....no......this was the beginning of my new life. One where I could make the rules! Where I go out and achieve more than I ever thought possible! This leash that had held me back for so long will finally be broken. But not yet, for when I stepped out of that bathroom there was one thing in my way from achieving all of this. Corn on the cob. There it lay before me. It's golden yellow aura shimmered across the dining room. Children peaking around their chairs, the staff whispering among themselves. I grabbed both ends of the sweet, buttery treat before me. I could feel the tender heat radiating from it. I could smell the delicious kernels. It ran through my body. In that moment, I was without fear, for I had nothing to be afraid of. My teeth broke into it's gentle frame. A burst of flavor had filled my mouth. A new found energy ran through me and into every atom of my being. It was as if my DNA was being over written. The darkness that had permeated inside me for so long was gone! I took bite after bite and savored every last bit. It was as if I was blind my entire life.....and I could finally see.  By the time I was finished, whatever darkness within me was gone. I was reborn again, a new man. I no longer felt stuck, trapped, or sick. I felt....hope. I felt hope because I knew from this moment on I knew I had the power to change my life. I had to power to give myself everything I felt I deserved! A better job, a nice car, a wonderful girlfriend! I had the power to achieve all of it!  Let me tell you.....this isn't the end of my story. Oh no.  This.....this is the beginning. A new life. However this time, I get to figure out the ending. Overall the place was pretty good, but I give it 4 stars because the bathroom was out of paper towels.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-millville,,,,,
7,Roberto M.,"Millville, NJ",0,3,,5.0,2017-02-06,"One of the best restaurants to go to. This is the place I go to when I want great service, and great food. The servers at this location is friendly, and helpful. I bring everyone to this restaurant!! That's how great the food, and service is. They have one of the best burgers in town! And easily is the fastest restaurant in the area. I highly recommend everyone to go to this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-millville,,,,,
8,Andrew P.,"Cape May, NJ",33,3,,1.0,2017-03-01,"My wife and I enjoy eating at Chili's, as we often do. However, tonight we tried a new location. The Chili's in Millville, NJ was by far the worst experience I have ever had eating in any restaurant ever. Service was awful, we waited at least 10-15 minutes before anyone even greeted us, 2 people--seated at a 6 top. We finally were greeted and got our drinks and ordered our appetizers as well. When they came out, the Fried Pickles (which are a favorite of mine) were soggy, which had not been my experience elsewhere. The Skillet Queso my wife ordered was new to us and just not of our taste. We did not receive napkins, straws or additional plates to share our apps, we're pretty easy going people and understand people have off nights... moving forward our dinner finally comes out and my wife's order was correct, but mine came out as Shrimp Tacos, I have a shellfish allergy. We let the food runner know that was not my order and she apologized and left to find out waitress. Again, another 15-20 minutes went by where our waitress did not come to say anything, no acknowledgement of the incorrect order and to our knowledge nothing was being done. My wife was waiting to eat until I got my food and since it took so long it began to get cold. We decided to share one cold meal, of which we weren't thrilled. When the waitress finally came back to our table we let her know we would not be having the other dinner because it had taken so long and her inability to let us know and that we would  like our check, again it took more than 10 minutes to receive. We are understanding people, had we been acknowledged and informed the situation was being handled this could have gone completely different, but our experience tonight at Chili's has definitely affected our love for the restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-millville,,,,,
5,Will B.,"Cedarville, NJ",95,20,17.0,4.0,2017-04-22,This place has improved in the past few months. I believe a new team is running this jawn and not shows. Good quality and service are great now!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-millville,,,,,
4,Francine D.,"Vineland, NJ",7,13,2.0,4.0,2017-07-13,"This place has definitely improved from when we first went there 6 years ago. The menu is better, the service and the management. All the servers have more get up and go in their step and more of a sense of urgency to your requests and better knowledge of the menu. The bartenders need to have a little less chatter amongst each other, but other than that i was happy with my last visit there. Give it a try if you haven't been there in a while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-millville,,,,,
2,Arpana B.,"Jersey City, NJ",9,58,51.0,5.0,2017-09-08,"I'm a big time fan of Chilli's and this was the first chilli's restaurant where I tried Mexican food. I have been here so many times and have no complaints so far. On the weekends, they might have a long wait time. My favourite appertizers here are southwestern eggrolls, signature boneless wings with bbq sauce (super delicious), and white spinach queso. For main course, I always like having chicken enchiladas, tacos or fajitas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-millville,,,,,
0,Trent B.,"Bridgeton, NJ",62,33,145.0,3.0,2017-09-30,"Come here once and a while with my wife for lunch, the restaurant is usually clean and there's never really a wait. She enjoys getting the smothered burritos while I enjoy the chicken crispers or a burger. Prices are as one would except from a sit down chain restaurant and food is pretty good for the most part. The one main issue I always have with this place is the waitresses never like to write down your orders , because of this on more then 1 occasion they've messed up a simple order. This of course annoys the shit out of you and makes you want to continue on to another place. Not a bad place to visit once and a while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-millville,,,,,
1,Sean M.,"Avalon, NJ",0,6,,2.0,2018-01-03,Ventured out to Chili's on a sluggish Wednesday night in January.  I was looking forward to a quick spicy dinner with my saucy lady. Instead I got a face full of misery from our waitress (Christina) and an hour and a half wait which resulted in me over eating their chips and salsa. The only thing bien about this experience was the trainee that helped us.  Thanks Paul for earning this disaster a second star.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-millville,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88
