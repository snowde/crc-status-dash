17,Soua L.,"Cleveland, OH",85,10,17.0,1.0,2014-05-14,"Horrible customer service. No one was at the counter and there were employees walking in and out. No acknowledgment if customers needed anything or that they'll be right with us. Finally after 10 mins I politely asked if someone would be abke to help us. This lady who rang out 3 people(me and two other older ladies) acted like the world was about to end. She huffed and shooked her head, seriously?  This Chili's is located inside the airport and I know that it gets busy, but she was rude. Makes me upset that people who work in customer service industry can't even do the simplest thing. No matter how tired or busy it is...you have to be nice. People will understand.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-milwaukee-4,,,,,
16,Jasmine S.,"Santa Clara, CA",311,249,88.0,1.0,2014-06-17,"Don't eat here... Very slow service. Food is actually not horrible, but order from the to-go window instead...  The to-go window is about the same wait, but at least you don't have to tip for service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-milwaukee-4,,,,,
10,Kate H.,"Auburn, WA",185,900,77.0,4.0,2014-09-04,"Ate breakfast here. Wow! Super fast service, even though the place was very busy. Our server was extraordinarily friendly and nice about everything even though she was super busy. Got our breakfast burritos, which were delicious and too big to eat. Great experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-milwaukee-4,,,,,
15,Una D.,"Northwest Washington, Washington, DC",122,657,,3.0,2014-11-17,"i had the southwest burger which was good,  i think , given the options, this was not a bad one to pick in the area , i had a long layover , they got me the food within 15-20 minutes, i went to the take out area so i didnt have to deal with tipping, the counter staff were great",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-milwaukee-4,,,,,
18,Nahria K.,"Covington, GA",0,1,,1.0,2014-12-12,"My companion and I stopped to grab a bit to eat and the service was terrible. We stood waiting to be seated and no one said hello or just one second. We stood for about five minutes. Then the employees from the to go window started to walk out like they were going on break. I stopped one of them and asked to be seated. She advised all the tables were full and that we could sit at the bar if we wanted. We got settled at the bar and I'll admit it took us a moment to figure out what we wanted. As we were placing our order, Sherri seem very distracted, threw the silverware down on the bar. Didn't write anything down said okay and walked to the computer to put our order in. My food came within 4 minutes. However, my soup was not even hot. My companions food was not delivered. Another 5 minutes went by. When my companion ask for a refill for a second time I asked where his sandwich was? Her response ""I have no clue! I guess I could check on it."" She then went back to her computer typed in his order. I advised her that we had to get on our flight very soon. Her response ""So does everyone else!"". She then disappeared for the next seven or eight minutes until after his sandwich was delivered. She didn't say anything to us until after the bill was dropped. Never apologized for the mix up our delay. I've been a sever for nine years. This was the absolute worst service I ever had.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-milwaukee-4,,,,,
6,Michael W.,"San Francisco, CA",58,20,1.0,1.0,2015-06-01,"No prices posted in To Go cooler. Was not given a fork. Had to go back to get it.   Was in a hurry so once I opened the Chicken Caesar Salad and saw a bunch of it had turned, I ate what I could.    Took a picture and emailed it to the email address on the receipt. Almost a week later and no response.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-milwaukee-4,,,,,
12,Barc O.,"Aldie, VA",0,18,,2.0,2015-07-12,Really slow for an airport restaurant. The staff seems annoyed when you ask questions. They act busier than they really are. Food is typical Chili's fare.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-milwaukee-4,,,,,
11,Ken M.,"Seattle, WA",40,173,64.0,4.0,2015-07-17,"Good food, nice bartenders, and easy to get to your gate; If you're stuck in the C Terminal then this place will help you pass the time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-milwaukee-4,,,,,
14,Nathan M.,"Overland Park, KS",1,5,,3.0,2016-04-27,I am a fan of the chili's restaurant chain menu including the limited menu at this airport location.  Judging by how quick I received my food they seemed to be adequately staffed. They appeared to serve everyone quickly which is ideal for an airport restaurant. The quality of food was the same as any other Chili's location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-milwaukee-4,,,,,
13,S A.,"Washington, DC",0,6,,5.0,2016-04-30,"Big thanks to Greg, the manager, who helped me get food despite the fact that they were closing. Last flight of the day out of C Terminal & NOTHING was open. Happy to get on my flight with a full belly. Thanks for the great service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-milwaukee-4,,,,,
8,Tayotis C.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,12,,1.0,2016-07-15,"I am writing this while experiencing the service. AMY, waitress, is horrible. I asked about the wine and she stated she doesn't know about the wine. She brought the utensils and threw them on the table. She brought the water and placed it at the corner. This is the worse waitress I have ever experienced.  I wonder if it's because of my culture.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-milwaukee-4,,,,,
9,Elle S.,"Olympia, WA",0,4,,1.0,2016-10-03,"We had 40 minutes to get breakfast and the food took 30 minutes to get.  My food was cold as they apparently forgot my husband's order.  The bartender said he comped the coffee, but we found that we were actually overcharged.  Another patron asked the bartender if he could put the Ryder Cup back one of the TVs (we were watching it earlier, but the bartender is apparently not a golf fan and just changed it) and he argued with him about how the patron was going to leave in a half hour anyway.  There are too many other better choices for places to eat at MKE.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-milwaukee-4,,,,,
7,Julie W.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,37,11.0,1.0,2017-03-11,"Ordered to go for flight, quesadilla super greasy and service seemed like I was putting them out to take my order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-milwaukee-4,,,,,
5,Debbie H.,"Marathon, FL",17,2,,1.0,2017-04-14,"I fly in and out of MKE several times a year. As I fly out I often stop in for a beer. It's cold its refreshing, however, this will be my last stop in Chilies. The bartenders seemed more interested in their own meals and complaining about the most recent employee being fired than their customers. They do still depend on tips??  Never even asked if I wanted to see a menu. Sad really, I believe MKE could position a more appropriate and appreciative vendor. Management pay attention your staff is taking away your bonuses.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-milwaukee-4,,,,,
4,Kati W.,"Denver, CO",2,28,6.0,1.0,2017-07-07,"Stopped here for a flight home. We ordered a cheesecake, a Bloody Mary, and chips and queso. The queso came, cheesecake took over 35 min (""it'll be just one more minute on that."") we never got a water refill. The explanation was there were so many tickets it took too long to bring out on time. I'll chalk it up to mismanagement. Either way, something needs to change.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-milwaukee-4,,,,,
1,Erik F.,"Miami, FL",18,47,30.0,1.0,2017-07-10,"Wow! A Chili's that doesn't have salsa on hand (for my breakfast tacos). What kind of Chili's is this? It's a Chili's where staff is observed texting, moving slow without a care in the world. So I wander over to the bar area for a visible bottle of Cholula to spill on my tacos.  Some bar clown bellows, ""this is Wisconsin, we don't need salsa"" to which I reply, ""I was born here friend, and it's sad when a Chili's doesn't have salsa"". On a positive note, the tacos were basically a huge heaping of scrambled eggs w two sausage patties plopped atop tortillas, so I achieved my goal of a carb-free meal!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-milwaukee-4,,,,,
3,Frank F.,"Tucson, AZ",0,7,1.0,1.0,2017-08-04,This is the worst Chili's that I have been. Once I was seated I sat unattended for 15 minutes while the servers were bunched up chatting. I left without ordering.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-milwaukee-4,,,,,
0,Christine N.,"Waldorf, MD",85,124,432.0,5.0,2017-08-19,Early morning flight and I was just looking for something quick. I did not go to the restaurant I went to the side counter which serves quick breakfast burrito and snacks. I got a regular coffee and a banana so I cannot speak for the quality of the food but the customer service was wonderful. I originally wanted the breakfast burrito without the meat but she told me that I'd be waiting a while for it to cook. She also held To my coffee while I ran to the bathroom was really sweet when I asked to fill my water bottle. It's the small things that makes food service and I was so happy to have a positive interaction to the start of my day.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-milwaukee-4,,,,,
2,Sarah W.,"Spokane, WA",0,3,,1.0,2017-11-25,"Our flight was delayed a few hours so we decided to stop in for some dinner. We arrived at 6:45 pm and waited a good 10 minutes for the hostess to show up, who then proceeded to tell us the kitchen was closed. Closed before 7 pm on a Saturday night! Absolutely ridiculous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-milwaukee-4,,,,,
