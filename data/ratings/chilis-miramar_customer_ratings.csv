57,Kristina V.,"Hollywood, FL",52,4,,1.0,2012-05-21,"Stunned. Went there two weeks ago on a Saturday night with the hubby for dinner. YUCK!! Potato skins were hard as rocks and didn't have bacon or scallions on them. Sent them back. Replacements were not much better. Mini Philly cheese steaks...half the roll was rock hard, half soggy. Replacements were even worse. There were chunks of nasty black burnt cheese in them and not a single pepper could be found(the Philly cheesesteaks use cheese sauce so this was clearly burnt cheese from a flat top that hadnt been cleaned). When the manager came over he was like ""yeah that's some burnt cheese, it happens."" really?? Then to top it off, my entree was hideous. The steak looked like it had been run over by a truck and there was more fat than meat. The mashed potatoes were like wall paper paste. The apples and cinnamon were quite good. Our server was friendly and the manager seemed to not really care. He comped the food that was horrible and our bill ended up being $9.00. Still tipped the waitress $20.00 but I will NEVER go back. If the manager doesn't care about the food then why should the employees...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miramar?start=60,2.436,2.436,2.436,2.436,2.436

Believe it or not, from the moment that we sat down and received our meal and paid our bill, it was all under a half hour.  BELIEVE IT!

The taste and the quality of the food is what it is to be expected from a chain. Sometimes great, sometimes not so good. Recently we have been seing a steady decline of the tast of the food. For example chicken with no flavor, just salt or with an enormous amount of pepper. Not edible. Corn on the cob, they forgot the butter. Steak and Shrimp Fajitas with shrimp floating in pepper. It seems like everything gets a bath in either salt or pepper. Come on guys I know it's a chain but you an do a lot better than this. The only reason we order from here is because it's less than a mile from our home which makes it totally convenient.

The food and drinks came in a little normal pace, it was a bit crowded when we came in. Nothing was wrong with the drinks we had ordered. We ordered food from the same 2 for $20 special, for the appetizers we had 2 chips (one from the lounge which is free and the one from the $20 menu) and then we have the flatbread which tasted alike a pizza, no problems there. We all had the classic bacon burgers served well done and no salt on the fires. We had no desert in this visit.

Hell, I barely expect good food here but it's been edible which is all I ask for. Well Chili's has these new chipotle bowls on the menu and it looks so beautiful and fresh on the menu's photo so I thought to myself...why not give it a try?When my chipotle bowl came out, I couldn't believe what I was looking at! It literally looked like they had scraped food off of a bunch of old plates and created what they call a chipotle bowl. I had everything in that bowl... a piece of broccoli, one penne pasta, a piece of what looked like fried chicken, and even a piece of shredded carrot...and none of that came in the bowl! I was disgusted because I'm almost sure I was served scraps! And to make matters more awful...it was room temp cold! I can't even imagine why they would serve anyone something like that. I am still dumbfounded as I type this! I told my waiter, who looked embarrassed as he waved the manager over (who also looked embarrassed)! The funniest part of the story is, they offered to make me another one!!! HA!!! ANOTHER BOWL OF SCRAPS...the kinda scraps you would serve to a stray?!!! I feel the chipotle bowl is just that...a bowl filled with leftovers! Absolutely NOT! I will never order this again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miramar?start=40,2.212,2.212,2.212,2.212,2.212

After 1 hour a d 30 min, we decided to leave. The Manager is totally absent from the main floor, buried in his office or kitchen. We have used plates over the table with waitress coming by and not realizing that it will be good to pickup the appetizer plates before people ask for the check, bottom line, a disaster, not a place to celebrate or expect decent service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-miramar?start=60,2.212,2.212,2.212,2.212,2.212

53,Sharon F.,"Hollywood, FL",80,20,,1.0,2014-07-17,"WORST EXPERIENCE! After arriving at 9:35, waited for a hostess 10 min, and 15 minutes for a waiter. Minutes later, another waiter came by our table to let us know he would be taking over. The first waiter came and apologized (strange drama). The salt with chips (not chips with salt) was difficult to eat. We, of course, drank up our drink quickly and had to stand up to find another waiter for refills. We got refills, and then waiter two  showed up to take our order. The burger was overcooked, served with fries instead of loaded mashed pot. Mashed potatoes came much after the burger was gone and it was plain, tasted reheated. The sw pair was not edible, it was salt and pepper with a tad of food. The tostada was cracked, salty and old. The enchilada was loaded with pepper, the rice must have been made the day before, the beans were cold. By now is past 10 pm and we had to get drinks refills at the bar ourselves. We waited another 20 minutes for our waiter to enter our dessert coupon code and another 10 for it to be served (past 11 pm). I commented how bad the food was to the waiter who came with a latex glove and told us how he'd cut himself so bad, he said the mgr would come see us (I am still waiting, he never came). THUMBS DOWN!

Not bad for lunch or dinner and pretty decent to bring the family to. Can get rather hectic when there are large groups. I don't know why, but every Chilis I've ever been to, for whatever reason, causes poor cell phone reception once you're inside the building.

Surprisingly enough Chili's has changed for the better, they have new screens on the table that allow you to order more drinks and play games (which is good if you have kids). The menu has had a pretty good revamp, though they no longer offer chips and salsa which is pretty disappointing. But aside from that the new menu looks great and the new drinks look really good. I ordered sliders with the new pickles, which are strong but really good and a margarita which again was really good.  Service has been hit or miss here in the past, but our server was polite, friendly and fast with our order and extremely nice. Everyone at the bar was also in a good mood and rather friendly so that was an upside to what I had seen in the past there.

Luckily we were seated immediately as soon as we got in but that's when problems started. We were waiting in our booth for a good 15 minutes before I got up to ask where the hell the servers were. Lo and behold, the BARTENDER, who was already handling 3-4 other customers AT THE BAR, came up and apologized and said he was the one supposed to handle our table and he'd be right with us. I've never worked in a restaurant before but this clearly shows how understaffed this place was. It was around 1:30-2 pm when we got here so it's still technically lunch time and there were maybe 1-2 other servers that I saw handling about 6 other tables. Our bartender server himself was sweating it up with constantly moving around between people and took another 10 minutes just for us to get our silverware and then another 10 minutes for drinks.  The food itself tasted alright (my dad got the Mango Chile Chicken and I got the Smoky and Sweet Burger) but food quality here has diminished ever since they were taken over by new management and started changing up the menus.

The hostess left to go clean off the table so we could sit. At 12:22 p.m., we were still waiting for the hostess to return. Two parties of 10 came after us and were seated by a waiter working the self-seating section while we continued to wait for the hostess to return. By 12:30 p.m. we were tired of waiting and got up to leave. That was when the hostess returned. She had the audacity to tell us that she was there all along and argue with us (the customer)! As we walked out, she rudely spoke up ""your choice"". Seriously?! I used to LOVE this Chili's but it has gone down the drain. I will never come back here again! Sadly the kids love this place!

I told here I didn't want it. She shoved it in front of me again and the hot plate almost burned my arm. I asked to speak with a manager and she said she was the manager. She rolled her eyes at me and asked me to take the steak. I refused so she walked away, came back, and shoved the check in my face.

My girls don't rate based on service they only know about food quality and they did the survey post dining on the table tablet. They gave neutral remarks despite the tablet we played games on.

I asked for extra pickles and was told it would be 50 cents extra because they make them fresh on the premises. These pickles were horrible!  They basically tasted liked cucumbers dipped in dill, but not pickled. The only good part of the meal were the French fries, which tasted great.

They top it with a honey and jalapeño alioli that I wish I could buy a bottle to put it on everything I eat from now on. Seriously, it was that good. It also comes with sliced avocados and corn bean salsa that just made the whole thing taste extra fresh.  My friend had the seared shrimp mex bowl.

Then her timer for the guacamole and lettuce was on 14 mins. The Togo person stated they were making the guacamole. Finally she just walked out and left her food there.

They had brought it out and it was sitting there for about 12 mins as I was timing to see how long it would take if it was our food. Finally said something to someone after they asked if I needed anything else. I said yes I believe that is my food that has been sitting there for 12 mins because I've been timing it. Got the food home and the quesadilla is disgusting. The bacon is not only Burnt and taste like it, but it extremely hard and not even stuck together like it should be. The Queso is ice cold. Chips are super oily, and there is a few chips in our salsa. First thing we thought is could this be someone else salsa they reused? None the less I am one unhappy pregnant women.

I dont mind the water stain left on it, but there was a piece of meat with cheese on my knife still. I addressed the waiter and he didn't over anything. The manager walked by and saw my disgusted face and me just sitting there not touching my food for him to say something. He told me that it is not possible that we reuse the salsa and that the chip machine is next the the salsa. I just said okay and asked for the check, so I can get out of there.
