46,Jordan M.,"Austin, TX",1,76,,1.0,2012-02-08,"i have been going to chili's for a long time so i decided to try this location. this place is absolutely incompetent in serving food. i went in there with family and for ten minutes there was no one even coming to our table or acknowledging us. there was no reason for this since we were sitting in a fairly well populated area of the restaurant and the restaurant was not busy at the time. the servers completed ignored us and after waiting it out a few more minutes, we walked out. the tables even had the name of the waiters written on them and still this happened. we will never be going here again even if someone else suggests it and i will make sure my family and friends do not ever waste their time with this location. seems like Korey P's and Nikki's assessments were basically what i went through. terrible, just terrible employees and management.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-missouri-city?start=60,1.6680000000000001,1.6680000000000001,1.6680000000000001,1.6680000000000001,1.6680000000000004

What horrific service, from the greeter, to the waitress, to a 2nd waitress we nabbed when we could find our own.   Rude, rude and more rude.  Dirty looks, ignoring us, behaving like we asked them the codes to send a missile when we asked for basic things, like, oh, y'know, a knife and fork?  We waited whilst tables were cleaned around us, with no drinks and no one offering to get us any. We also had to ask for refills. The hot rice came out so far ahead of the fajitas that it was cold before my food came. They just handed us hot plates of food, instead of sitting it on the table front of us, which was friggin annoying.  Asked twice to split the check and 1st time she forgot, 2nd time she split into 3! And stood hovering for us to pay, omgggg!  Food was grand, experience was awful.  The staff in this place is a disgrace to the Chilis brand (or at least the 3 we encountered!!)

The Ziosk is definitely some hi-tech fun for the kids and teens to play with *wink* and as a matter of fact, it is an easy-to-use system that allows customers to self-order drinks and happy hour items and self-checkout and pay; that way, customers who wish to place orders (bar items only; no entrees) and/ or wanna pay the bills just don't have to wait forever to be helped when the servers are busy!   However, the Ziosk might be creating some laid-back servers.  Why I said that?  Well, my server tonight just kept on telling me to try using the Ziosk while he had been sitting around, chatting with the other servers, and not wanting to work! GrRRRRrrrr that was okay.  I had checked out and paid the bill on the Ziosk successfully.  Teeheee :P Food was alright; service was slow though!  It was the Super Bowl night, and the restaurant was widely empty while just 2 tables in the dining area; yet, we still had to wait quite some time for the foods.  We had requested additional shrimp on the Cajun chicken pasta from the 2 for $20 deal, but were charged extra $2.75 for only 3 seriously small pieces of shrimp, and the chicken was all dried up!  what a rip off!!   Bye Bye now, Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-missouri-city?start=20,1.7400000000000002,1.7400000000000002,1.7400000000000002,1.7400000000000002,1.7400000000000004

11,Amber S.,"Sugar Land, TX",244,311,44.0,2.0,2014-03-22,"I have no idea why we came back despite our horrible experience last time. I guess we were just too lazy to drive to the SL location like I said we would. Here is what went wrong: -It was EXTREMELY disorganized in the front. The 2 hostesses seemed to have no idea what they were doing. There was a huge wait - about 20 people cramped in the small area in the front of the restaurant. The hostesses seemed to be completely confused on who was next in line. They kept butchering peoples name because they ""wrote in crayon"". Yes, they said that.  -One of the girls in the front was extremely unwelcoming. She was literally slouched at the podium with her hand on her forehead greeting customers as they were walking in with a very monotone and irritated expression. -We waited 20 minutes to be seated...but there were SO MANY empty tables in the restaurant. Crazy. -Once we were seated, it took THIRTY minutes for them to take our order. -Those little Ziosk tablets on the table only work for (certain) appetizers, drinks, desserts, and paying your bill. It would be nicer if they worked for ordering a meal as well since service was running extremely slow. -The iced tea I got was pretty much sugar with a side of tea. It was gross. -Our server was nonexistent after taking our order. Different servers kept going around asking tables around us if they were doing okay but totally skipped us each time.  -We got half the amount of fries they usually give.  The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because the food was actually good. The chicken was tender and tasty and the fries were fried to perfection. That being said, it definitely wasn't worth the crappy experience. Next time, for sure, we'll go to the SL location no matter how lazy we feel. It was such a ridiculous experience. Sad to say both times we've experienced the worst service EVER has been at this location of Chilis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-missouri-city?start=40,1.736,1.736,1.736,1.736,1.736
1,Michelle M.,"Missouri City, TX",129,9,3.0,2.0,2014-03-27,"It was late and we were tired, and just needed some food. The food is usually ok, but the service was HORRIBLE!! We have no reason to ever return.  * When we walked in there was no hostess, nobody greeted us and we stood there waiting to be acknowledged for quite some time. Finally a server from the bar came and asked us where we wanted to sit. Yes, as in ""Where do you want to sit?"" No ""Welcome"" noting like that.  * Once we were finally seated, the same waitress took our drink order, she was quick with that but the iced tea I got was disgusting. Tasted like dirty dish water. When I complained she said, ""Oh yeah, you're not the first person who has complained, must be a bad batch"". Would have been nice to know before, or just maybe they could make a new batch??? * We weren't ready to order right away, so she disappeared on us. We asked for ""just another minute"" and she gave us about 20. During this time while we had nothing else to do, we started to notice all the servers hanging around doing pretty much NOTHING.  * She finally took our order and then disappeared again while we waited a long time for our food. This is getting ridiculous! Once our food came, we must have turned invisible. No service after that at all.  * I had to ask her repeatedly for a box and she didn't even mention the stupid Ziosk (which we already hate!) thing OR offer to bring us a bill, she just was busy talking to her friends. Finally we paid via the Ziosk, and got out of there. I wanted to complain in person to a manager but I couldn't see one (Or any other servers) as we walked out.  Just overall, horrible service. I don't know why anyone would ever go back there (Except maybe for those honey-chipotle chicken crispers).

While this may be a good place to just catch a drink for Happy Hour, for lunch or dinner it is totally opposite. Those Ziosk things don't make sense, mine didn't even work! If you are trying to show the world you know technology and want to make it like that, make sure it works!  Another thing, the service. I recall an anecdote when I was 5 or 6 at this exact Chili's and I was crying because the food took forever. The waiters just don't seem to care. They seem like nice people, sometimes at least, but just don't care about this job really. The food takes much longer than any other restaurant. My mom could've driven to Uptown and back and our food still wouldn't have arrived! The food was okay, but you know what satisfies customers? Decoration! I ordered a sirloin with broccoli and mashed potatoes. The broccoli was scattered. Mashed potatoes were a little messy. And the steak had butter all over it. Then a little roll. It looked nothing like what it looked on the menu.  Chili's, you only get 1 star because of your bar. When you sit down, wait a little while before you chow down. That is your motto I think. I felt like I was really claustrophobic and a germaphobe while in there because it was just disgusting.

39,Brooke S.,"Missouri City, TX",1,34,,4.0,2014-09-28,"**UPDATE** They recently did an overhaul in redesigning the restaurant and it looks so great! New lights, lantern chandeliers, chairs, table, walls, paint, everything! I used to work at a different Chili's Restaurant, so I know a few of the operating 'in and outs' of the Brinker Corporation.  Anyway, my point here is not to focus or rave on the food but mainly the staff. I usually come here whenever I take someone to lunch because it's relatively neutral and does have some 'lighter' options for entrees. The lady manager is awesome. She checks up on all the tables, whether lunch or dinner, big or small. The waiters could be a little more attentive but a handful of them are quick, considerate, and are able to read their tables pretty well (special needs, recommending food, etc.). I can't emphasize how much this is a handy tool in the food service industry. Chili's Grill & Bar food is pretty generic. Like I said, my focus here is the management and wait staff. I went last weekend on a date night with my husband and our waitress was very knowledgable of the dishes and drinks. The lady manager was also interested in our experience.

From a corporate perspective, Chilis has gone away from what used to make it great with their most recent menu overhaul. They are trying to be a Ruby Tuesday -- small portions, mediocre food, high prices.  Now, on to the specific feedback for this place. We sat in the bar area on a not-that-busy Saturday night. They serve watered down drinks and while our server was pretty, he wasn't much more than that. I ordered a Captain and Coke and he asked me if I wanted my wine mixed with the Coke, or to serve two separate drinks. Um, what? On top of that, it took forever for him to serve us our food even though we ordered perhaps the most simple of meals (burgers and fajitas).  On top of that, the bartender was super rude. He must forget that he makes the most money when you treat the patrons well since they'll tip you better.

Its less than 2 minutes away from work and sometimes I just crave it or a coworker does but never again! I came here on Thursday on my lunch break with my coworker. I picked it because I had some points on their rewards program so I was going to get a free lunch combo. We ordered the new appetizer-white queso.. it was pretty good. My soup came with no spoon.. the waiter was always disappearing so by the time I could ask for a spoon, my food came out. No point in eating the soup and letting my food go cold. Food was ok, typical chili's. The part that made me mad was the whole paying on that stupid machine.  Not only did it not let me use my points to pay, it wasn't able to split to check which it clearly stated that it could. There's a ""split check"" button but it wouldnt do it. I had to flag a manager down and he just went back to the old way and swiped it on his computer.  It's always something with this location.

Tonight, this Chilis went above and beyond in underwhelming service. My wife arrived before the kids and I, and had been sitting for a while when we got there. Many minutes later the waiter arrived and suggested we switch sections, as the brain dead host was sitting everyone in his section. Ok. Nope, no better with 3 servers strolling around and non one stopping to take our drink order. I left a dollar for the tea my wife was able to get and we left. Good bye Chilis.

54,Steve L.,"Missouri City, TX",450,302,361.0,4.0,2015-08-25,"Chili's has just became my go to to-go place.  It was 6:40pm and I had wasted about 15 minutes idling in our car looking at another restaurant's menu, only to find out that restaurant was closed down. So I had to do a quick search around the area and find something that didn't have ""Donald's"" or ""fil-A"" in its name. Those who have young kids understand. So one glance at the chili pepper and I was sold. I looked at their online menu (which was well-designed btw) and ordered over the phone. Service was quick, courteous, and to the point in helping me order. They said it will be done in 20 minutes. Food was piping hot and ready to go when I walked through the door.  Everything smelled so good and I was getting hungrier by the minute, even my wife (who was sick at the time) commented on how it smelled so good. The surprise is when I came home and I bit into the classic bacon burger. OH MY. Were my taste buds lying to me? I bought the burger off the cuff, thinking its a safe choice. But I didn't expect this to be that delicious. The patty was perfectly seasoned, juicy, and packed with freshness. This is maybe a half step down from Guru, but oh man, everything from the applewood smoked bacon, melted sharp cheddar cheese, fresh lead lettuce and the Chili's signature sauce, was absolutely perfect. It was so fresh, not what I'm accustomed to from a chain (and a to go order)! We also had the Dinner for $20, which was a steal. We had the chicken Cajun pasta which definitely made our taste buds dance more. I'm used to eating bland, dense, and sometimes overcooked chicken breasts on my pasta. However, the chicken was excellent, juicy, tender, and not dense at all. The pasta and sauce was just a bit overseasoned, but I had to stop myself from eating the whole thing. And that was because the Texas fries appetizer was so huge. Were we hungry? Yes. Did we get this to go? Yes. Was the service good at the to-go area?  Prompt and courteous, everything packed well and ready. Was the food good? It was not only good, but so good that it made me long to eat it again as leftovers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-missouri-city,1.84,1.84,1.84,2.128,1.8400000000000003

Hubby and I have not been here in at least 6 months because the last 2 times we've been here the service was so bad, the tea had a sour, dirty taste and the food was just okay. Today we decided to give it another try because we were at Home Depot right next door and we were starving.  When we walked in the door there was a hostess there to greet us. That's never happened before. In fact the last time we were here, we watched several people leave without eating because we waited so long for someone to seat us. This time we were seated quickly and our waitress arrived at our table within a minute to take our drink orders. She brought us our tea that tasted freshly brewed and kept our glasses filled throughout our meal. After ordering our food, it was delivered to our table piping hot in a reasonable amount of time. The corn on the cob was sweet and juicy and the black beans had a nice spicy kick that made my mouth tingle. My honey chipotle chicken crispers were perfectly fried and had plenty of the sauce over them for once. Hubby's mashed potatoes and cream gravy were good, but the real star of the show was his chicken fried steak. It's a new item on the menu and after the waitress recommended it, he decided to give it a try. The hand breaded steak had just enough crispy coating and was so tender it almost melted in your mouth! Hubby said its the best CFS that he's had in years. That's quite a compliment because he usually doesn't get too excited about restaurant food. I had plenty of food of my own, but I kept sneaking bites of his steak because it was so good.  I don't know if this location has a new manager or what, but things have definitely changed.

The bartender who waited on us was more concerned with drinking her Starbucks than writing down our order. We ordered the $35 Dinner for 2, got some weak margaritas, really good onion rings, 1/2 rack of ribs, and the Mango Chile Tilapia(We actually received the Mango Chile Chicken but didn't want to wait for it to be remade). I have worked in many restaurants and there is a reason you write down the order, she had to come back and ask questions. We got a dessert, Classic Molton Chocolate Cake, delicious, and the Fried Cheese Curds, highly recommend those.  Food was good, but these days, service is lacking everywhere. When we asked the host at the front if they had all day Happy Hour, he said ""I don't know, I'm new"". Wtf? Why didn't he say, ""Let me find out for you"". The trash can outside was overflowing and those are host duties, as well as opening the door for guests. He just stood there the whole time. The rest of the servers hung out in a booth near us talking about their weekend instead of helping in the kitchen, cleaning, and running food. The manager did not seem to care, he never came to our table to ask how we were, he was busy handing raffle tickets to his servers for his kid, watching the game, and playfully throwing towels at the bartender. No manager I have ever worked for would do that, they always say ""If you've got time to lean, you've got time to clean"". Which is the way it should be in restaurants, everybody works as a team to give the guests a good experience.   We waited 10-15 minutes after finishing our dessert for our check while our bartender finished her Starbucks. We only came here because we had a gift card, I will be regifting it if we ever get it again.

There is absolutely no professional oversight. The food orders (size and taste) vary from one day to the next. This time around I ordered chilies original chicken crispers and the size of the crispers came as the size of McDonald's McNuggets.

58,Michael K.,"Sugar Land, TX",161,40,33.0,3.0,2016-08-18,"When I was a small child, Chili's used to be a regular destination for me and my family, but now that times are changing and restaurant chains are no longer ""cool"" to go to, I haven't visited Chili's too many times recently, either. While it is true that many American restaurant chains have grown too large in size and have menus that are too expensive to be able to guarantee high food quality, Chili's is still an okay place to visit once in a while. Admittedly, Chili's isn't the best value, and doesn't serve the highest quality food, but some of their lunch specials come at a decent price, and the size of their menu makes it a fair choice for family dinners.  My favorite thing on the menu is easily the original chicken crispers, which are coated in a unique batter that is lighter and crispier as opposed to more crunchy breadcrumb-coated chicken fingers you typically find at restaurants. At over $10 plus tip for the meal, though, I can't say the chicken is better than Raising Cane's in any way. I tried the ultimate bacon on my last visit, and was neither surprised nor disappointed with how the burger came out. The toppings saved an otherwise overcooked burger from disaster, and the sauces and bacon added enough salt and moisture to make the burger acceptable. The bun was tougher than I expected, but no to the point I would call it stale. I do like the quesadillas here, since they are stuffed with a lot of cheese and griddled with plenty of oil to make the tortillas crisp.  Chili's most recent promotion has been their grass-fed burgers and their $10 burger meal deal, and while these promotions did in part attract me to revisit Chili's, I didn't try either one of them. If Chili's is trying to make itself known for its burgers, I would at least suggest making sure they are cooked to order. While it is certainly difficult for a large chain like Chili's to truly make any major changes, I do feel that the growth of the company has over the years caused a decline in overall food quality.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-missouri-city,1.96,1.96,1.96,,1.96

When I asked the runner why it took so long, they said it was because the dining area of the restaurant was busy.

Two of us got the special deal they have where 2 eat for $33. and it was a great deal! Most of the food is fried, which isn't my type of food, but overall I'm going to have to say that I was pleasantly surprised with the Margaritas and food this time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-missouri-city,1.96,1.96,1.96,,1.96
52,Jeff A.,"Sugar Land, TX",3,20,6.0,1.0,2017-06-24,"When you enter a restaurant to eat the last thing you want to see is TRASH everywhere - on the floor - the tables - the entire bar area - I can understand if the place is slammed and no one has the time - but when the bar tender is standing there and staff is just walking around - it's unacceptable - I'm not sure what the issue was or is , but someone should be accountable to come by every 10/15 minutes and pick up the tables and floors . Just food for thought - and I will not be dining at your establishment again. Only reason we stayed my daughter was heart bent on eating chilis and was starving. I took a video of a lot more - not posting for some reason - but if corporate wants to see - I can email it -",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-missouri-city,1.96,1.96,1.96,,1.96
50,Lynn N.,"Florissant, MO",10,4,,1.0,2017-07-06,"Table was dirty. When the waitress finally came after about 10 minutes, she said 'oh, I need to clean this table'.  She walked away and came back with a dry napkin and 'dusted' the table off. Then she left for 10 more minutes. I had to go to the bar and order drinks, and later ask for water.  I ordered a rum neat and a corona margarita. The bartender told the the waitress to charge me for a double.  The margarita had no alcohol in it.  Never coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-missouri-city,1.96,1.96,1.96,,1.96
56,Terri E.,"Katy, TX",0,16,7.0,1.0,2017-10-06,Terrible service and the hostess will ignore you completely while you stand there. The bar area is equally as rude and they can't make a drink properly at all. How can they keep hiring managers that can't keep employees in check. Bad attitudes make such a bad dining experience! I've been going there for over 16 years and I'm done with this place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-missouri-city,1.96,1.96,1.96,,1.96
47,Billy E.,"Missouri City, TX",0,60,1.0,2.0,2017-12-18,"Went for lunch Sunday around 1pm - party of 5. Sat at the table for 15 minutes and never saw a waiter/waitress. Asked the hostess, and she said they were short handed, so we left because if that is the way service is going to be, then I'd rather not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-missouri-city,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0
