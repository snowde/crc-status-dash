Many years ago Chili's in the bay area was my happy hour hang out with co-workers. I had not visited one since and probably should have stayed away and kept the happy memories. We ordered, but could not eat, what has to be the most awful and disgusting fajitas produced anywhere. This is processed food at it's very worst. To be this bad, it had to have come frozen in a pouch produced in some far off factory. It did come with rice and beans, but like the worst scenes of a horror movie, it's best to close your eyes and cover your ears, to the side dish. The description of some things should be avoided. To the restaurant's credit they did ask if we wanted something else and deducted $10. from the bill.

Their bar drinks are served topped with ice, a sure sign that they are in trouble.

She was on top of it. She had perfect timing when it came to asking us if we were ready to order to checking on us while eating and giving us time to order dessert and not rush us out the door.  I ordered the loaded potato skins sans green onions with ranch and they were pretty good and not very greasy unlike some places. Our entrees were the Southern Smokehouse Burger with no bbq sauce and no pickles and the Crispy Crispers with ranch. The burger apparently was made with extra pickles rather than no pickles, BUT it didn't come to the table that way. Priscilla told us she noticed the mistake and promptly had them remake the burger so when it came to the table, it was perfect! The crispy crispers were done perfectly...the fries were properly seasoned, the corn on the cob hot, sweet and juicy and the chicken had the proper amount of crunch covering the juicy chicken. Dessert was the brownie sundae and I admit, I wasn't expecting it to be anything special, but my god was I proved wrong. That brownie sundae was so freaking good...I mean it was PERFECT! Ice cream for every bite of hot brownie, thats right, the brownie is made fresh to order...mmmm it was delish! This was the best experience I have ever had in a restaurant. I never felt rushed, even when it got busy with the dinner rush and surprisingly it never seemed too loud in there, which is such a nice thing when you don't have to yell across the table to be heard by your dinner companion.

5,S B.,"Sacramento, CA",0,63,32.0,3.0,2016-11-17,"So I'm all excited. I'm out on the road and I get to eat on the company ticket. Yay. I might as well eat at a nice place! Except there is a problem. It's Modesto. Yeah. A city that thinks it's San Francisco. It has a couple high rises. It has a parking garage. But it's not. It's Modesto. A city who's motto proudly states ""At Least We Aren't Stockton."" Come on. It's a cow town. So here's the dilemma - where am I going to go? If I were in the mood for Mexican, there are LOTS of great Mexican places here. But I'm not. I'm actually thinking about a burger. But a nice one. Enter Chili's. It's a known commodity. It's no Morton's, but it's no Denny's either. (If I let you eat at Denny's, it means I hate you a lot.) They don't do anything particularly great, but they do almost everything. The thing they do best is their ribs. They don't do great ribs, but they don't do shabby ribs. I'd have the ribs but I don't feel like making a big mess. I don't need to drive to the site with rib goo all over my shirt and pants. The burger menu looks enticing. The girl comes over to take my order. ""So, is it possible to get this burger lettuce wrapped?"" She kind of has this confused, estranged look on her face, thinks for a moment, and says ""These burgers are really too small to wrap in lettuce, um, so..."" Wow! Say no more, honey! And thanks for your honesty! I can clearly see that this isn't going to work out! Just give me the steak and shrimp combo, rare! You go to Denny's and get a steak, you get an overcooked piece of gristly meat that is tough to chew plus it isn't very big. This isn't that, it's a pan fried sirloin. It won't knock your socks off but it's a reasonable cut, and, as expected, cooked more on the medium side than the rare side but was okay. Again, this place doesn't 'do' steaks. They have them, they do a reasonable job. The shrimp? Well, they were okay. Again, not great, but not bottom tier either. The asparagus was there for presentation mostly, it was pretty much burned to the hot plate thing. I left kind of wanting more. Not more necessarily, more taste I guess. I eyed the Italian place. Should have gone there maybe. I probably could have gotten a ribeye. Oh well. Look, if the whole, one person lunch with an ice tea hadn't set me back thirty bucks out the door, (or rather, set the company back thirty bucks) I would have been joyed. Not overjoyed, just joyed.

Our waitresse was good but seemed to have quite a few table so we had to go a little longer on our refils. Besides that she was awesome. We had a very annoying person sit next to us and the waitress dident skip a beat.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-modesto-10?start=20,3.12,3.12,3.12,2.768,3.1200000000000006
23,Justin G.,"Stockton, CA",6,1,,1.0,2016-12-26,"Well I should have known it was gonna be a horrible experience when we first walked in as the hostess didn't greet anyone, and when she was calling out names for when tables were ready the person standing 2 feet in front of her couldn't hear her. She would only say the name once and if no one responded she would just go onto the next name, didn't bother to check to see if anyone was waiting outside or anything.  Well, we get seated and our drink orders are taken and brought, we order and wait, and wait and wait some more.  It's Monday and the NFL is on, we seriously waited for food for almost half of the game, and all the while our waitress never once came to see if we needed refills or to check on us at all.  But that didn't stop her from talking for minutes on end to what I suspect was a fellow non working employee who was seated behind us.  So finally our food is brought to the table my kids are starving by this time and everything is ice cold.  Seriously I had ordered fajitas and the skillet and its contents felt as if they were sitting outside in the 30 degree weather for 30 minutes, oh and did I mention that it was a different employee that brought the food.  We still hadn't seen or heard from our original waitress for over an hour.  When I tell them that they need to take my plate back as its ice cold the waitress gets an attitude and then goes and gets our original waitress who doesn't seemed to be all that phased by my issue with my fajitas basically having frost on them, we then let them know everything is cold but since my kids are practically starving we don't really have an option but to let them eat it, since god knows when they would ever see food again.  The waitress then storms off flailing her hands in the air and a while later brings my fajitas back, hot this time, and tells us she is sorry but the kitchen is messing up orders and is messing with her money in the process. My sister in law ordered a salad which didn't have any salad dressing with it, we let the waitress know after she went on her little tirade, in the mean time the manager comes over to apologize about everything and to let us know she would be taking a discount off our meal for the inconvenience. In the meantime the waitress brings the salad dressing and manages to completely disappear for the rest of the night never once coming back, but she still managed to take her sweet time talking to the person behind us time and time again, so we finish eating and go to pay for our food and notice nothing has been taken off of the check or any discount what so ever. So we have to hunt down our waitress she then looks at our tag and leaves doesn't say anything then comes back and takes the discount off and leaves doesn't say anything, we ask her for a box she says she will get one but almost 8 minutes go by and she had passed us twice, I had to get up and basically walk into the kitchen to get someones attention to finally get a box so we could leave.  In all it took over 2 1/2 hours to get out of there. Needless to say someone basically lost their tip with how they mismanaged the situation by never trying to make up for it. Horrible, never going back to this location and yelp really needs to allow people to leave no stars, cause that is what is deserved of this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-modesto-10?start=20,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.404,3.0000000000000004

The one in Stockton and Fremont are the best. The service is ALWAYS slow and 8 out of 10 times the food is either wrong or cold. I enjoy the queso and chips and my kids like to eat here so I go here a few times every few months to satisfy their cravings. I really hope they get better with custom service as time goes by I know a lot of people like to have drinks and appetizers here. When we went this past weekend it was pretty slow during our visit and yet we didn't get helped in a prompt manner and our food was wrong.
