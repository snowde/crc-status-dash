Steak arrived...or should I say beef jerky arrived. Charbroiled exterior.. super dry white interior. 5 minutes after receiving our order, next table received their RIBS. WTF! Spoke to manager. She apologized, but had no explanation. Discounted our food 50%. Not good enough! Our experience sucked. Called corporate. Said they'd get back to me.

I want my baby back... baby back... baby back riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiibs... and to think out of all the trips to chili's I have ever taken, I have never had their ""award winning"" chili nor have I had their ribs. crazy stuff... But so far as a chain restaurants go this one is better than most but dont confuse that with being outstanding or great... its decent food at an average price, so i dont mind getting gift cards here as much as other places... So lets discuss this particular trip to the old Chili's B&G. It was a blistery winters eve wence the munchkin and I were faced with pangs of hunger. As I looked in the pantry to see what to prepare, the munchkin yelled out dont go there! I turned to her in a jiffy and queried what wanteth thou? She thus proclaimed, I want to go out to eat DAD! Quickly did my mind reel with wonder on what we should do. Then I recalled I had a couple of gift cards to Chili's. So we piled in the truck after checking for coupons in my email and charged off to the nearest Chili's a few miles away.  We hopped out and cruised in pulled by a tractor beam in our tummies... and we had what seemed like a million toys in tow, the munchkin had to have her my little pony, key bracelet, phone, and clifford the big red dog stuffed animal (luckily in miniture).  So onto the grub... we used our coupon for free queso and chips (they included fresh salsa too!!!), the munchkin got a corn dog and steamed broccoli with lots of ranch (somedays I wonder if she really is my daughter, then I take a look at her and know, but such odd eating habits...), and I got the classic, one of my all time favorites, Chicken Fried Steak!!! with mashers swimming in country gravy. I did a water and the munchkin for a super duper tasty slushie concoction that I want to try with about a 2:1 slushie to vodka  mixture!!! Ohhh that would be uber dangerously tasty drink. So we got our grub and the munchkin strictly wants to eat her broccoli with ranch and I practically had to force her to eat a couple of bites of her corn dog. Meanwhile I dug into my CFS, mashers, corn on the cob, and shared the garlic toast with my daughter... The grub tasted was tasty overall (except the bread had some char on the bottom)... However the portions were half what they used to be... Perhaps this is due to the economy or just how Americans are trying to cut down their portion size...  Definitely an enjoyable trip for the munchkin and I! I will be back, I have another gift card to spend :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monrovia-2?start=100,2.8,2.8,2.8,2.48,2.8

Now i want to start by saying that our waiter was great and pretty fast on bringing out our food.  Now for the food...yuck times 10. We ordered the triple dipper appetizer to share (which BTW came out same time as our food..) with the spinach artichoke dip, chicken crisper's and big mouth bites. Well aside from everything being cold it was not worth the $10.99 price. The spinach artichoke dip was cold and not very good. the chicken crisper's cold as well, the big mouth bites were only 2 and not amazing at all. Now for my chicken Caesar salad...ummm can you say regular iceberg lettuce and microwaved chicken? Really Chilis? You are going to charge me close to $10.00 for iceberg lettuce and some rubbery microwave chicken?

One day we went to the Chili's in West Covina, I ordered my usual and we waited a Lil longer than usual for our meal but didn't complain.

Tonight I thought I'd give Chili's another shot and not let the West Covina location ruin it for me, so I tried the Chili's in Monrovia, ordered my usual, again wait was a Lil long! Our food arrived and what do you know......MY FOOD WAS COLD!.....AGAIN!!! How could the same thing happen to me at TWO different locations??? Not only was my food cold, but my bf's food was cold as well. I spoke to the manager and she took our food off of the bill. We only paid for our drinks.

We asked for a table for 2 and they asked if we would mind sitting in the bar area. I thought that was odd but didn't mind. We ordered the strawberry lemonade but the drinks tasted watered down. My friend ordered shrimp tacos and I ordered the triple dipper with southwestern egg rolls, cheese steak sandwich and boneless buffalo wings. The shrimp tacos were good but the rice that came with it wasn't. My egg rolls are good but the cheesesteak and wings were just okay.  The service was alright but I was disappointed in the food.

Crap - now I'm obliged to write a review.  So here's the thing. On any given day this review could be one star and it could be much as four stars --- o.k., o.k. you're right ---- as much as three stars.  Sometimes, I will have a waitress (never a waiter - weird) that is totally on top of things. Taking our orders. Making jokes. Being generally cool. Other times, I get the waitress from that ""Office Space"" only she doesn't look as good as Jennifer Aniston. You know. The one who could care less that she is there. The one who is praying to be fired. If only some customers with balls would step up and complain loud enough - but no one does.  At least the food is a consistent greasy mess that is available at ""happy hour"" prices fairly late. I particularly like some of the burgers... So, I give 2 stars because in general its ""meh"", but sometimes its ""bleh"".

The service itself was excellent, Hilary our server did a great job and was very attentive which I find rare in chain restaurants these days.  But the food, oh my it was GROSS!!! I ordered chicken fajitas, and they didn't even look properly cooked. It didn't even look like real chicken meat. They were the most tasteless fajitas ever, I actually had to salt/pepper and use the watered down Tabasco sauce they offered me to make it taste like something, anything! I can't be certain but I think the stomachache I got later that night had something to do with the fajitas, just sayin'. The bf had the Baby Back Ribs in two different sauces, and he said it was just okay, but that he has had way better, and he won't bother ordering them again there. This coming from a man who rarely EVER complains about food!!!  The prices didn't seem appropriate to the portion sizes or overall flavor of the meal. The fajitas were $12.99 with no sides, as sides cost .99 extra. The lack of cheese, tomatoes and tortillas is also irritating. The cheese wasn't even enough for one fajita!!!

FOOD/DRINKS - 3 Stars: We ordered the $35 meal which included an appetizer (half order depending what it is), two entrees, and one dessert plus two margarita drinks. Texas Cheese Fries: This was pretty good. It was thick cut fries, cheese, bacon, and some ranch. There was a ton of cheese which I loved. I'll say that the half order was good enough for us. Anything more would've been way to heavy. Bacon Cheeseburger: This was a bacon cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, and onions. This was juicy, but it was a bit bland. I enjoyed it for the fact I was craving a burger, but that was pretty much it. Sadly, I've had better. It also came with a side of fries that I changed to loaded mashed potatoes. I was also excited for this, but it was alright. I kind of picked at it, but that was it. I'm a potato head, but I easily passed this over. Margarita Grilled Chicken: This was good. My friend liked the chicken and everything that came with it. I wish I enjoyed my meal as much as this was enjoyed. Cookie Skillet: This is a Pazookie wannabe. I had high hopes for it since I was actually craving a Pazookie, but this was a let down. I still ate it though, but the cookie wasn't as gooey as I hoped and it was actually sunken-in in the middle of it, which made it look a bit funny. The edge of the cookie was really overcooked so it was really cripsy versus the soft center. It came with some vanilla ice cream, which I took off. Presidente Margarita: I really liked mine because it had mango in it. I was surprised since I'm not a fan of the margarita taste, but this was good. SERVICE - 4 Stars: Our server was very attentive and awesome with taking our order even though we changed our mind at the very beginning. He was also helpful with us deciding what to order and his input was appreciated. ATMOSPHERE - 3 Stars: This place is noisy and busy with a lot of action. Aside from the kid constantly kicking the booth chair shared for two tables, everything was alright. There's also a bar area where people were watching the game so you'd hear shouts every so often. RECOMMENDATION: Well, I've had my Chili's fix for a couple of years or more. I don't think that I'd necessarily have the craving or desire to go back unless I had to for some reason. Don't get me wrong, you'll get some decent food here, but this is not high on my list of places to come back to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monrovia-2?start=120,2.72,2.72,2.72,2.412,2.72

Fast forward to when we asked for our check... We showed her the free appetizer promotion we received. She said she couldn't honor it during happy hour. I asked to speak with the manager who then repeated the same thing. (That's funny because we were in recently and our server had no problem honoring a similar promotion. Too bad that server wasn't working today - she was nice.) Basically our server and the manager refused to budge over an appetizer that's only worth a few bucks.

I know on Yelp we get into the local businesses and try and help out the mom and pop's as much as we can. But at some point, you just have to admit that Chili's can do no wrong. (See my about me section.) My wife and I came here on Saturday night and there was quite a wait (because it's Chili's and everyone in their right mind wants to eat there.) We waited about 25 minutes and then were seated- no sweat. We had all the delicious things you normally get when you go to Chili's. The chips and skillet queso are a must. The salsa is the best you will try from anywhere. Don't get pretentious. It's okay that Chili's is the best. You can just accept it. I had the southern smokehouse burger and my wife had the honey-chipotle chicken chrispers. Chili's is getting fancy with their new menus, but they really just need their old standbys. We also both had a couple of margaritas.  Paul was our server and he was THE MAN. He brought us chips and drink refills and we didn't even have to ask for them. The restaurant was super busy and he was so polite and kind. He was awesome. I know you might want to try somewhere new and exciting... But Chili's is just the greatest.

213,Amanda D.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,10,,4.0,2015-02-27,"The husband and I went on a Thursday night, it was packed to the door.  They got slammed with a table of 14 right at the start of the dinner rush, and the kitchen was backed up etc.  We were told about a 15 minute wait, not too bad, and it really ended up being about 10 minutes.  There was a group of 5 waiting next to us, and the hostess came around telling them for groups that big it'll probably end up being another 30-35 minutes... she gave them some crackers and the kids a drink each..and even with all the chaos, they ended up being seated about 5 minutes after us.  They were really trying to make things as easy as possible for all of us waiting.   We never went a moment with an empty glass, and were checked in on frequently, but not so often they're crossing the line into bothering.  All the servers were hauling ass to get things done not only quick, but correctly, and it showed.  Our guy, and the surrounding servers were all very pleasant and friendly, not too rush-rush that you feel like you're just another number and tip in the wait.   My usual favorite is the Honey Chipotle chicken crispers, oh man how I love those things... but tonight I was in the mood for fajitas.  I opted for the dual chicken/pork carnitas option, and added the new rice and beans to it.  The pork carnitas were very tasty.  The chicken was good, but no seasoning on it...it still tasted good, like chicken, but I was expecting some fajita seasoning on it at least.  Once I put the toppings on it all was better.   They were just fajitas, how can you really go wrong with that right?  I hate when the cooks get lazy and the peppers and onions come out almost raw, or they go over board and it is all getting mushy.  All the veggies tonight were absolutely perfect.  Firm, yet cooked, and the onions were sooo yummy and caramelized perfectly!   My husband tried a newer option to the menu, the steak with grilled avocado.  It comes with a fancier salad option (vs. the standard garden salad), and some roasted little tomatoes with garlic.  Some kind of green sauce on the steak, with a few slices of grilled avocado.  He had the steak cooked to medium, and OMG, it was amazingly good.  Nice and hot pink center, perfect crust on the outside, sealed all the juices in, and was so tender like butter.  The veggies were delish too!   They have a new appetizer--fried pickles!  And their pickles are house made.  I'm originally from the south, where fried pickles are much more common than out here, I was in heaven while eating this app!  They mix fresh garlic in with them too.   Also love their chips with salsa and regular guac.  One of our favorites to start with.  Their salsa isn't spicy, but it has a very nice fresh tomato taste that is so refreshing.   The only thing that I didn't like was the new stupid tablet order things they put on all the tables now.  It flashes options to pay for games, credit card offers, and supposedly you can use it to order drinks/dessert etc, and if you're paying by card you can pay there using it without your server..  It was annoying and in the way.  You're supposed to go out to eat--to EAT... not to add yet another electronic distraction.  If you have to pay for games to keep yourself or your kids in line while eating, maybe you shouldn't be eating out in public, lol.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monrovia-2?start=160,2.68,2.68,2.68,2.352,2.68

Payment was do-it-yourself with a table top terminal.  Very impersonal.  Very minimalist. Suffice it to say, Chili's apparent business model is cold and unfeeling.  I eat out probably 10 meals a week, and like a warm welcoming environment.  This was not it.  It wasn't for me, but maybe it's for you if all you want is some tasty grub and aren't picky about the environment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monrovia-2?start=100,2.4,2.57,2.57,2.1239999999999997,2.502

Reina even remembers us when we're dining and stops by to say hello even when we're not in her section.

75,A T.,"Los Angeles, CA",277,202,180.0,2.0,2016-02-20,"Wanted to try someplace we hadn't been in a while.  We started off at another restaurant - but it was over an hour wait.  Sooo, we moved over to Chili's - that had just a half-hour wait. No problem.  It's a weekend night and it's SoCal...you're going to have to wait at some point. Ordered drinks at the bar while waiting for a table...only to find that WHEN your table comes up they have no way of transferring your bar-tab to your table (such a system exists - I've seen it work). This breaks up our party into couples that are now scattered-about, trying to find and follow our hostess and our table while other servers are running all about with trays of food up and down the aisles. Okay, so we're at our table, our server is nice and attentive, we order, we get our food - and the cola is mixed to the point where it's mainly just soda-water & coloring. Nasty.   Burger joints and restaurants make QUITE a bit of mark-up on soda - so when I come across someplace that tweaks the mix even further, it's usually a sign of bad management - or just plain greed (it literally costs just pennies per serving for the establishment for the syrup.  They then recoup that cost by charging $2-2.50 per serving - and don't forget: the ice helps disburse the image of that serving). Unfortunately, one of our steaks - that had been ordered at medium-rare - came out all brown (Brown is NOT M-rare), so we had to send it back.  Took forever to get it replaced.   As another yelper pointed out - the payment system has now been changed so that after seating you, taking your order and serving it - your server (their employee), no longer has to deal with you.  S/he can be dealing with an entirely different group of people.   Meanwhile, I had to get up and find replacement flatwear (for the missing ones taken with the over-cooked steak), and napkins for our party (we had been given none). Later, we weren't even offered dessert - or a dessert menu to consider. (maybe management decided that was getting in the way of table turn-around per-hour - who knows?) You now pay via a wireless tablet with a built-in printer.  Swipe your card, choose what percentage of tip you wish to leave, sign, and your receipt is printed out immediately. No more human-interaction needed.  In essence; ""Thanks, now SHOO - we need this table for other paying customers"".  (yet they didn't pony-up for the system what allows your bar-tab to follow you to your table). Overall, the experience was NOT what helped make Chili's a cool, go-to place it was in it's early days.  AND, the food wasn't really that good in the first place.  Just, bland. Next time, we have decided to skip Chili's when people are visiting. As we commented about the place on our way home, i mentioned that - in MY mind - Chili's has definitely jumped-the-cuisine-shark...and in doing so, has actually ELEVATED Sizzler to a much more respectable restaurant. (Disclosure: once worked for Sizzler - and still love their salad bar).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monrovia-2?start=60,2.2,2.59,2.59,1.8,2.434

My girlfriend and I ordered online for takeout. When we arrived, we were told to talk to the bartender to get our takeout order. After a good 5-7 minutes of standing at a vacant bar, we had to ask a waiter if he could help us, ya know, get some service. Finally the bartender came out and looked up our order. She said, ""Oh, here it is. Let me prepare that for you."" We both took that to mean that they were starting to make our orders right then and there. Whether or not that was the case, our order was finally ready after another 10 minutes and a bunch of questions to any passing staff about whether or not they were aware we still existed.  After a short drive home, we realized the food was cold. Not even lukewarm. Our theory then shifted from the meal being made when we arrived to the meal having been made long, long before that. It was gross. It made me sign up for a Yelp account just to write this review. I probably wouldn't have taken the time to do this and would've chalked it up as a loss, but the 12 hours since that ""meal"" have consisted of stomach cramping, nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting.

He then asked me all these other alternative questions to try and figure out how he could prove I did NOT get sick from burgers I ate at his restaurant.  Is he all of a sudden a nutritionist giving me advice???   As you can see from all the other terrible reviews, this place honestly just sucks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monrovia-2?start=40,2.04,2.44,2.44,1.4760000000000002,2.2800000000000002

Then they finally sit us down and give us the menu we had just sat down and asked if we were ready to order we need to see the menu first were not sure what they have, so they give us like 20 minutes to pick our food that is way too long they didn't even bother to check in on us to see if we were ready to order. So then the girl finally comes back. After a while our food is brought back to us. After we finish eating we keep looking around for the girl who was serving us, then i see her just standing around gossiping with another co-worker i wave at her to let her know we are ready for our check. She takes a while to put it in the system. After she brought us the check then disappeard again for like 10 minutes. We just left what we owed with the bill on the  table.

114,Doug T.,"Pasadena, CA",0,4,,1.0,2016-09-20,"Well, I was hoping I didn't have to right this review, but I had to let this be known. Having many options to go to dinner on a Sunday night I thought Chili's would be a good choice. Was I wrong. First the waiter thought he was very smart by saying what you were going to say before you finished your sentence which was very annoying. He must of been annoyed him self that we had moved from the bar area to his section. We waited a very long time to get are food 20min just to get one side salad then another 20 to get the rest. Next the burger I  ordered was over well done when I had told him I wanted my burger medium. That's not the bad part, it was stone cold in the middle along with cold fries. He never came by to see how our meals were, never once refilled our drinks. So we finally had to ask another waitress to ask for our waiter he must of know we weren't happy because it took another 10 min to show up to see what we wanted. Finally we told him everything that was wrong and all he could say is that he had other tables and if we needed to talk to a manager he would go get them, so another 5 to 10 min later we  finally talked to the manager, she did not seem to concerned she just asked if we wanted another burger, we just wanted to get the hell out of there. She said she would remove the burger from the bill. Funny thing she never came back with the new bill, we had to go look for her in the bar area.

96,L P.,"Baldwin Park, CA",0,21,6.0,1.0,2016-10-04,"I want to start of by saying that I actually love Chili's and frequent the West Covina, Diamond Bar, and City of Industry locations on a regular basis. I am quite familiar with the menu, food quality and what to expect in terms of service, I ended up at this Chili's by default because I had intended on visiting the Applebees's right down the street but it has been closed down. So as we drove down Huntington Drive I saw Chili's and was very confident we would get the best  food and great service regardless of all the other food options available.     We walked into the restaurant and were told that it would 15-20 minute wait for a party of 4 at about 3:45 PM on Saturday. Not bad but as we sat I noticed they were not busy and one side of the restaurant was empty.  So when they finally come to take us to our booth we had to walk by 3 large tables that were filthy and from where they sat me I could see that there 2 other smaller dirty tables as well. Gross!! I also had a direct view of the bar area where I could see a group of employees standing around talking. Not a big deal if the tables were all clean but they weren't. The waitress who is Yvette, greets my family pretty quickly and takes our drink order and I ask her to bring us some chips and salsa which is my favorite. She then informed me that there are no chips. I let her know that I am disappointed and surprised that something that is so popular is not available. After our meal orders are placed, I noticed that there are still employees congregating in the corner and I notice this because I realized that we had been waiting a long time for our food. I ordered Texas cheese fries with no green onion and when they finally came out they have a ton of green onion. I didn't want to send them back because I waited so long in the first place so I just picked off the onion. The rest of the food comes out and my soup is tepid at best. Ugh!! Then to make matters worse one of the employees who was consistently standing in the corner brings out chips and salsa to another table!!! Huh?? So we ask Yvette if we could get chips and salsa and point out that the table across from us received some. Yvette states, ""We have chips now? They never tell me anything here."" And she goes to see if she could get us some and she never comes back to update us. Finally we get her attention and she says, ""There are no chips, that table only got some because they were difficult."" What??? I ask her who the manager is and she says Kyle. I walk to the corner where all the employees are standing which is in the bar area and they don't acknowledge me. So I just say, ""Hello!! Are any of you Kyle?"" And Kyle said Hi I am Kyle. So I proceed to tell him about how disappointed I am in the restaurant's lack of cleanliness, the fact that they have employees standing around when things need to be addressed, and that a table that was seated after us received chips when I was told there where none. Kyle only made matters worse because he informed me that there are no chips and he actually made the chips for that table as if he deserved a pat on the back. Not once was I offered an explanation as to why he only made enough chips for one table or an apology. I walked back to my table, had the waitress get us boxes, paid my bill and  walked out. Guess where Kyle was standing when I left? Right, in the corner!! I will NEVER frequent this Chili's again especially after reading all the comments on YELP. It seems as this location has had many issues for a while. I am so disappointed as it appears that the Corporate office is aware and they are choosing to turn a blind eye to the situation. Poor customer service, filthy restaurants and poorly trained staff is a recipe for disaster. This sends a bad message to your clients which makes me consider never stepping foot in any of their restaurants.

Dillon was our server. He was a nice enough kid but not at all on top of things. I asked for an order of chips and salsa to munch on before we received our dinner, he forgot. Then during our meal we asked him to bring us water, he forgot. Then, I used the little kiosk machine at our table to pay the bill. When Dillon came by as we were about to leave, I told him that we paid our bill already. Then, he leaned over the table and gave himself a rating of ""excellent"" on the kiosk machine. I didn't notice after I paid the bill that i would have the option to rate my server. I was very annoyed that he felt he gave us excellent service when in fact his level of service was just mediocre. Also, why the hell did he take upon himself to complete the rating instead of asking me to do it? I reminded him that he forgot our water.

It wasn't a terrible decision but it also wasn't that great. The server Kyle came over to introduce himself to us and take our drinks fairly quickly which made me very happy because that almost NEVER happens, usually I'm waiting 5-10 mins to even b noticed. So he helped us order by suggesting a few tasty things. So we ordered the 2 meal deal for $22, 2 salads, 2 entrees and that's it. I ordered steak COOKED MEDIUM! my sides were loaded mashed potatoes and broccoli. My daughter ordered ribs with a side of mac n cheese. Also Kyle convinced me to get her a side of ""street corn"". When the salads came out is where the problems started! They brought us blue cheese when we clearly ordered avocado ranch. It was fine for me but my 9 year old just wasn't having it LOL. I also ordered extra cheese on both salads, which I had to ask for 2 times before we could even get it. Finally the salads were fixed and out food came out. Now u would think that since u saw my daughter was so young that you wld tell me there HOT PEPPERS cooked into the mac n cheese rite?! Well wrong! Kyle never even mentioned it at all, so as soon as she took a bite she was crying bc her mouth was on fire. My steak was bleeding all over my plate. I ended up getting a rare steak instead of medium like I ordered, and my potatoes were cold. Guess what never showed up at all tho? My street corn!! The manager was also named Kyle, at this point I felt like we knew each other for years bc I had seen him so many times in the time it took me to get our salads and dinner. Honestly if it wasn't for him I wld NEVER go back to this location ever again in life, but he was so super kind and helpful that he saved a customer for chilis. Also there was a sever in the bathroom when we went to wash our hands that I ended up giving my servers tip to bc she was even better than him and she didn't even come to our table not once!

121,Mary T.,"Altadena, CA",1,65,1.0,1.0,2017-02-18,"Every few months we go to Chili's and I get a half rack of ribs.  Today we made the mistake of going at 4:30pm on a Saturday.  We got seated after a 15 minute wait.  There were 3 tables of 4 near us that all ordered around the same time we did, 2 of them AFTER we ordered.  They all got their food around the same time, but they had to wait quite a while.  After they were all finished eating, and we had STILL not received any food but my asparagus side order, they explained that it was because my husband ordered a TURKEY BURGER.  What was also strange was that they brought my asparagus side order out immediately and it was cold.  We asked them to reheat it and they brought it right back, COLD, and it was the same plate, since we had tasted it, we could tell that, which is fine.  But salty and COLD again. After another 20 minutes, they came and said they would take off the $1 charge to get the premium side order!  And we could have dessert.  But we don't eat dessert.  But they could not comp us for anything else, e.g. the ridiculously expensive 9 oz and 6 oz wine ($18 plus tax and tip, and there was no way the 9 oz glass was 50% more than the 6 oz, they looked almost identical, very shy pours both of them, I'm an engineer and I'm a little OCD). Eventually the food came out.  My husband said no onions, and wanted mustard and mayo with his turkey burger.  Well he got onions but no mustard or mayo!!!  I am not kidding!  Yikes.  My half rack was cold and dried out.  I asked for extra sauce to take home, but they just brought me a little container to put the sauce I still had in!  And then the box was too small for the leftover ribs and the waiter yelled at me and said I asked for a SMALL BOX.  What I had asked for was a box, and a small container of sauce.  I had already figured out that the ribs would not fit in a small container.  We had tried to be really good sports all this time, under these circumstances, and had not even really complained except about the cold asparagus. I rarely leave less than 15%, usually 20-25%% (it's a lot to work in a restaurant) and we eat out at least 2x a day.  But when she snapped at me about asking for a larger container and wasn't willing to give me the container of bbq sauce, I did something I have not done in years.  I left no tip.  The bill was over $40 for a turkey burger, half a rack, and 2 very small glasses of wine.  I realize most of this was not her fault.  But we had not yelled at her or anything.  So her little comment about ""you asked for a small box"", maybe she did misunderstand, but again, we eat at several places who claim we are the nicest customers they have! Ironically, it was mobbed with people willing to eat here as we left.  That is okay with us, hopefully the places we want to eat at will be less crowded.  We will not be going there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monrovia-2?start=100,1.56,2.05,2.05,1.924,1.8539999999999999

The Margarita chicken especially, that was my favorite plate until now. The chicken was extremely salty but the messy beans and spoon full of rice was enough to dilute it; it used to be flavorful and colorful. My sister ordered the enchilada soup, also salty and the waitress stated that it was on the salty side. No entre should ever be to salty and their chefs should know better. My husband mentioned his favorite plate used to offer a variety of sides that he didn't get this time around. Ultimately it comes down to the display of all their entrees and the taste and quality of the food as any other restaurant. They should look appetizing and appealing; only the salads look amazing these days.

7,Cammie N.,"Arcadia, CA",227,59,27.0,2.0,2017-09-18,"Ever since Applebee's closed down in this area, my family didn't really have a go-to sit-in chain restaurants type of thing that still had fairly cheap food. So, we decided to opt for Chili's and this was probably one of the worst decisions ever.  At our first visit, the place was pretty packed, so we understood why there was slow service and what-not. However, they made up for it by offering us free chips and salsa which was pretty cool. So, our first time visit went fairly well. Thus, we decided to go for our second time and this just wasn't ideal at all.  On this visit, the service was extremely slow as there simply wasn't enough workers. There wasn't a long line and I would assume that there were a few dabbles of people here and there. However, we had to wait a long time to the point where it just became frustrating. We had to wait approximately twenty minutes to order our food. On top of that wait, we had to wait another hour to have our food come out. Honestly, it just wasn't worth it.  Parking-  There is plenty of parking as this is in a huge plaza. However, finding a parking spot close to the restaurant might become a bit iffy as there are a lot of restaurants nearby.  Food-  Honestly, this kind of made up for the wait time. However, it was either too salty or too bland. (we ordered the bbq trio or something like that)  Service-  One of the worst service I've had before. My parents and I had arrived fairly earlier than families of our same size. However, they were seated before us, which my mom wasn't too pleased about.  In general, come here if you're super hungry and somehow the chipotle or the panera nearby don't suit your taste or come here if you would like to waste time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-monrovia-2,2.52,1.98,2.376,,2.196

He said they don't have any burger with mayo. We educated him about the ingredients of 1000 island dressing. It took FOREVER to get our order taken because the server didn't know how to listen not to mention he didn't understand the ingredients on the dishes so therefore was not capable of answering the questions asked. Not to mention he just flat out didn't listen. I asked him to omit the glaze because I don't eat sugar. He then went to the kitchen or I assumed that was what he did. I then see him walk back out after 10 minuets and take another tables order! He then came back and tried to educate me that all glaze has sugar. I said no kidding that's why I told you to omit the glaze and educated him as to what omit means as it was apparent he didn't have a comprehension of the words definition. He never refilled our drinks! It was so cold in there that I had to walk outside to warm up. In summation, I froze my tits off while waiting 40 minutes to even put an order in. Had to deal with a server who just showed up to collect his paycheck and could care less about whether or not he is proficient in his job. I can't say I would ever consider coming back.

The thing I always get here are the Chicken Crispers.  The heart attack on a platter as one waitress said to me many years ago.  I never really order anything else as my main entree as this is my favorite item on the whole menu.  Sure, I've tried the fajitas, burgers and even the ribs. I mean, who can forget their infamous song.. ""I want my baby back, baby back, baby back..."" Still after all that, it's all about the original chicken crispers. The other main reason why I come here is because they have one of my all time favorite desserts, the fricken chocolate molten cake. Omg this thing is to die for. Perfectly cooked chocolate cake with warm hot fudge oozing in the middle. Crowned with vanilla ice cream and chocolate fudge over that.  .tasty. Food came out tally fast, but he service was a little lackluster. Once the food came, we didn't see our waitress for awhile, a good 15-20 minutes after.

2,Grace C.,"Monrovia, CA",272,841,720.0,3.0,2017-11-03,"I am a creature of habit so my default order every time I come to Chili's seems to be chips and salsa and the 3-item Ultimate smokehouse combo set.  I love how thin and crispy their chips are, as I'm not a fan of those heavy thick deep fried chips that some other places serve. I usually go for the salsa accompaniment, but sometimes, if there's a Chili's deal going on, the queso is pretty good too. The smokehouse combo comes with roasted street corn, fries, garlic toast & pickles. For the meat, you can choose from chicken crispers, smoked sausage, BBQ chicken breast, or ribs. I've tried them all and enjoy the ribs and chicken crispers the best. I usually find chicken breast dry so I normally prefer to have dark meat over white. The smoked sausage is delicious, especially the first bite, but eating the whole thing gets overwhelming (too much flavor and too heavy at the end), which makes it drop down the list after ribs and crispers. 90% of the time, I only get as far as ordering the chips and salsa and the smokehouse set and then call it quits with leftovers to take home. The other 10%, I'll still order the same and have leftovers, but add in a dessert of the molten lava cake.
