0,Andrew Q.,"Hyannis, MA",40,147,73.0,4.0,2013-05-07,"Typical Chili's. I've spent many of nights here a few years ago when I was staying at a near by hotel. I then came here when I worked in the area. Returned the other day when I was in the area. Nothings changed, besides the menu.  The staff is all great and super friendly. They even remember me from a few years ago! Yay!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-montville,,,,,
21,Barbara F.,"Norwich, CT",27,12,2.0,4.0,2014-01-20,"I am a huge NON-fan of chain restaurants but have been to this Chili's multiple times recently because the wait staff is friendly, cheerful and attentive. They don't care if you are having a quick appetizer or a full dinner. You get the same quality service. The food is basic but consistent and served quickly.  As long as the service stays 5star, I will be a repeat customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-montville?start=20,,,,,
16,Heather S.,"Columbus, OH",14,14,22.0,3.0,2014-07-04,"I went here this particular evening for my husband's God-son's birthday.  He turned 5 that day.  Our waitress was very accommodating and checked in often.  She was sensitive whether or not our friends, parents of the God-son, wanted the staff to sing happy birthday to their son or not.  Of course they did, but still it was nice she asked.  I got the turkey club sandwich for dinner.  It was pretty good.  The bread was wicked sweet but everything else was fine.  The things they had for the kids to order from was pretty fun.  They gave them crayons and these little booklets that included their menu to order from.  We got the cinnamon lava cake for dessert.  I wasn't really a fan, but my husband really liked it.  It came with vanilla ice cream.  It was wicked sweet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-montville,,,,,
22,Johnny P.,"Uncasville, CT",0,6,6.0,5.0,2014-07-27,The chicken wings here are very very overcook. It's funny because every time I eat here the chicken wings are the same. I bet you ask why do I keep coming back. All of the other food that I order is good. But the chicken wings if you want to call them hot wings are very very overcooked and dry. I'm giving Chili's in Montville five because other foods they serve is very good and the service is on key.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-montville?start=20,,,,,
17,Donna N.,"Uncasville, CT",0,12,4.0,1.0,2014-09-16,"I hate writing a bad review. But I will never go to this location ever again. It's very close to my residence, and I am disappointed in how badly I was treated. First, I went to the bar to sit, I was alone, so why take up a whole table? Anyway. I was greeted briefly by a 'bartender' who barely acknowledged my presence. She passed me a menu and disappeared. Minutes later another man came in sat, was greeted and cooed over while I sat with my menu closed, ready to order and hungry. The bartender proceeded to ignore me still, got him a beer, and asked if he wanted to order. I had been sitting there prior, and was obviously ready to order too.  He placed his order and sipped his beer, meanwhile I still had no drink. Eventually, she came and took my order for a lemonade (blackberry I believe) and shrimp tacos.  The wait for the food was not long, but the actual food was such a disappointment. It was not flavorful, and I felt ripped off. I never leave food at the restaurant, but this occasion, I left two tacos and half a glass of lemonade. It was that bad.  I guess, that is what to expect from a corporate restaurant that doesn't give a hoot about service or food.  Go to the casino instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-montville,,,,,
19,Jon W.,"Merrick, NY",0,35,11.0,4.0,2014-11-13,It's a Chili's so you know what to expect. That being said I came in around 9 pm and the staff was attentive and courteous. I was seated in the bar area where happy hour specials are available (3-6 pm and 9-11 pm closing). Good value. Several dinner size choices for $4.99.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-montville,,,,,
12,Brooke M.,"Plainfield, CT",38,6,3.0,1.0,2014-12-30,"So disappointed! I order here often and i always order salmon. And for the most part everything come out as expected. HOWEVER, this time was disgusting! My salmon was swimming in juices and practically breathing when i got it home. It smelled terrible! Almost rotten. I will drive the extra 5 miles and go to Lisbon so at least i know i wont contract a food born illness.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-montville,,,,,
15,Christopher D.,"Norwich, CT",1,1,,1.0,2015-02-09,"Worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant. I was treated horribly by a waitress because i asked about moving our table. Very unprofessional staff, I will never go there again. There are at least10 other restaurants in the area that are a lot better. Wish I could give zero stars",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-montville,,,,,
13,Erika L.,"Norwich, CT",40,33,14.0,4.0,2015-02-14,"It's Chili's, so you know what you're getting as far as the menu and atmosphere is concerned. Their new e-kiosk thingy is pretty cool, allowing you to pay your bill immediately at the table and leave feedback. You can also use it to order bar drinks.  We got the southwestern egg rolls as an app and a couple of chicken dishes. Mine was a mango chicken dish, which I really enjoyed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-montville,,,,,
20,Jax P.,"Uncasville, CT",189,13,,2.0,2015-03-25,We came in on Monday for the all you can eat fajitas and the waitress tried talking us out of it to order regards order. Lazy I guess. Heard her talking to another customer to talk him out it worked. Com that's promotional,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-montville?start=20,,,,,
14,Jamie M.,"Norwich, CT",25,16,4.0,4.0,2015-09-11,Wonderful out of this world fajitas!!! I always get the steak fajitas and they are always tender and delicious and I love their guacamole!!! Always fresh!!! Always fast!!! Always a treat!!! Their margaritas are a little weak though. I'd stick with something from a bottle or nonalcoholic.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-montville,,,,,
18,T M.,"Oakdale, CT",0,1,,1.0,2016-03-09,Chili's is normally a safe bet. Not last night! Last night my wife and my son went in about 5:30ish to beat the dinner rush. The place was practically empty. We waited about 30 minutes for our food (did I mention the place was empty). When the food came out my wife and I's  food was ice cube cold. It literally tasted like it was in the refrigerator. We returned our food and left.  I won't be going back to that location for sure!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-montville,,,,,
10,Tom G.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,99,10.0,2.0,2016-07-04,"Sat at the bar.  Amazing, awesome, friendly, smart bartender.  Ordered a salad, wildly over-dressed.  Ordered a chicken burrito to go...should have known something was up when they put the sour cream on top instead of on the side (which made it this sort of foamy, warm milk by the time I tried it an hour later).   After chopping the top of the burrito off I tried the inside which was just gross.  it was salty beyond reason and just felt like I was eating the worst kind of pre-packaged fast food.  It's a chain and I can't blame the guys here as I imagine they don't even have a say in what goes into the product. But man, was that a waste, other than the great bartender convo.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-montville,,,,,
8,Lola B.,"Guilford, CT",7,14,,2.0,2017-01-15,"This place is okay. Their tacos are actually pretty good. My main complaint is that the rice is ALWAYS undercooked, like nearly crunchy. We have been there a dozen times and it is always undercooked, by a lot. The Mexican side of the menu is pretty good, but do yourself a favor and don't order anything american...it is tasteless and awful. Service is adequate, no complaints.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-montville,,,,,
11,Tom M.,"Reno, NV",0,4,,1.0,2017-01-17,"Good to see Chilis corporate has an interest in my review. However, a bad link was provided for contact. Guess I should not care as they don't seem to be able to get it together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-montville,,,,,
7,Abigail L.,"Montville, CT",0,26,12.0,4.0,2017-04-30,"My husbands and in-laws first round of coffee was cold, but the second round was fresh and hot. They ran out of broccoli (my daughters favorite) but obviously these things happen. My in laws enjoyed their meals, as my husband and I did. I got the margarita chicken and it was excellent and didn't taste ""healthy""! I would go again. The service was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-montville,,,,,
9,S D.,"New London, CT",23,17,2.0,3.0,2017-05-06,No red pepper. Isn't this called Chilis??? Pasta Alfredo's very dry... service fair to midland.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-montville,,,,,
6,Luke M.,"Dublin, OH",2,39,2.0,4.0,2017-05-28,"My wife and I got take out here and it was excellent. Wish I could give 4.5 stars. Queso, salsa and chips were very good. My burger was excellent and my wife really enjoyed her quesadillas. It was seasoned really well and the steak was very tender. After a long day traveling we were tired and just wanted to grab something for the hotel. This place knows how to do take out right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-montville,,,,,
4,Chuck C.,"Vernon, CT",116,190,3.0,2.0,2017-08-02,"It's Chili's. What can you say? I'm not a big fan of Chili's to begin with. There is nothing remarkable about the food. The atmosphere isn't special, and the clientele is usually noisy and rowdy. This is on par with other Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-montville,,,,,
2,Patricia N.,"Norwich, CT",18,5,10.0,1.0,2017-08-07,I went in for take out and ordered there the wait time wasn't an issue it was fairly quick I got my order and left and I should have opened it up while still there but the produce on my burger was disgusting like I work in a restaurant at the casino and we sort our tomatoes and lettuce before we deliver it to a guest this chili's gave me a nasty end of a tomato and the pieces of lettuce that didn't looked washed and the piece you rip off at the top. If I knew this is how my burger toppings would have turned out I would have went somewhere else like Aroogas. This was a waste of my money,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-montville,,,,,
3,Jen D.,"Norwich, CT",236,42,2.0,1.0,2017-09-29,Felipe E. The cook is so rude. He's so disgusting I would never want him to cook my food again. Always has a bad attitude!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-montville,,,,,
5,David H.,"Williams, AZ",25,1,,1.0,2017-10-14,"Came in from out to town to watch a football game with my wife at the bar 10/13/17. We each had three drinks in a 90 minute time period. We were not loud or obnoxious as we are in the over 50 crowd. I drank two 6oz glasses of wine and a Ice tea. My wife had three Margaritas. We took an Uber being responsible. We were informed when trying to order a 4th drink that there was a three drink limit. We quietly left, never to return to a Chillis again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-montville,,,,,
1,Melinda M.,"Norwich, CT",30,12,13.0,1.0,2017-10-25,"My son wanted to give this a try, so we said why not?  We were immediately sat down and ordered with no issues. Our server was very nice and our appetizers came out quickly.  We had our family of 4 - two meals came out and then a long wait until the other two. Our friendly server became near non-existent. 3 of the 4 of us were drinking water so I asked for a pitcher of water which was great but my son kept waiting for refills of soda. Mind you, there were no more than 6 tables occupied at this time.  I ordered fajitas with 3 meats - the steak was really good, but the shrimp and chicken tasted frozen and not very good. The manager came over and gave me a discount on the meal because I literally couldn't eat the other 2 meats.  Our server seemed more concerned with hanging out than paying attention to us - while another server who had the table 3 spaces away was constantly present. It was disappointing overall - $72 and I left literally feeling sick to my stomach.  And to cap it off, I'm pretty sure there was a squashed roach on the bathroom floor - I didn't say anything because the manager had already discounted my meal and I really felt like if I had said something about that they would have treated us like we were fishing for comps. I just didn't feel valued as a customer.  Over priced food and subpar service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-montville,,,,,
