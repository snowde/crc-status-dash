We were told it was a 20 minute wait, but as I looked around, there were plenty of empty tables, some in the bar area, some in the regular area. Many of the tables hadn't even been bussed. I approached a manager that walked by and asked why is there a 20 minute wait with all these empty tables. His response was if they seated everyone, the kitchen would become extremely backed up and meals would take longer to come out. Dude, you really need to fix your kitchen!! That is how you lose customers. You make customers wait because your kitchen is slow?? There's a fix for that...get new kitchen staff before your people run your business into the ground!! Kudos to our waitress who more than overcompensated for our wait! She was on too of our needs and our glasses were never empty.

I think it's because the staff is just THAT slow. What may be a 45 minute dining experience anywhere else is easily doubled here. And don't come here thirsty, because you may sit the entire time and never get a drink refilled.  The cooks must be alright though, because the food in generally is prepared correctly and tastes good. It's just hard to enjoy a good food experience when the rest of the experience is so frustrating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-moore?start=20,,,,,

BUT recently they have gotten a NEW MANAGER and he is amazing! I asked for a medium well steak one time and it was more well done, too much for me. He fixed it no problem. I always sit in the bar because the bar tender (skinny male) is always super nice and is an amazing server as well as bartender. Another good server is a young male with gauges and tattoos, which I have had before and is super sweet as well. If the kitchen staff ever messes up on our meals the staff is always friendly and fixes it no matter what. This Chili's is starting to go back up hill and is becoming better everytime I go in! I love this chilis!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-moore,,,,,

Subscribe to their email list to take advantage of their rewards club.  Entrée was so-so. Had the chicken and steak fajitas. Steak meat was chewy and overdone. Not a lot of flavors going on either.

5,Tim S.,"Oklahoma City, OK",43,184,266.0,3.0,2015-12-24,"Had a good lunch today.  I ordered the pick 3 top shelf tacos.  I chose the steak, chicken, and spicy shrimp.  Surprisingly, the spicy shrimp was the most flavorful and wish I would've ordered 3 of those instead!  The chicken and steak were kinda bland.   We also started out with the white spinach queso, which was decent and they freshly make it on every order.  The chips are pretty good too.  Overall, it's been awhile since I've ate at Chili's and they have redone the menu, I think.  It was pretty good though, almost too many choices and the service was good today. One side note I'd make about the kiosks at the table.  The paper never rips out easy when you print a receipt and I end up messing the machine up. Maybe it's user error, but I like the idea.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-moore,,,,,
19,Jeremy E.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,4,5.0,1.0,2016-02-17,"Definitely won't return. Gave this place a third chance after numerous issues with food quality in their to-go area. Sadly was a last minute option so close to home as we dined in on 2/16. Floors were nasty, way understaffed which resulted in poor service and empty drinks. Can't expect a lot from a Chilis but when co-workers are aimlessly walking around doing nothing maybe help out those who are busy by refilling water and tea? Last time we visit this location for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-moore,,,,,
23,Richard R.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,25,,1.0,2016-03-10,"Worst chilis by far. It never fails... our order is ALWAYS wrong. It's not a pleasant experience when you always have to return the food. And it has happened whether we eat in or order take out. If I remember correctly, the last time we complained to the manager, he told us that he was new and taking over, knew they were all messed up, etc. Didn't apologize or anything. With that said, shouldn't talk bad about your employees and not only that, why are things worse than before? Will definitely be traveling to another chilis even though this one is down the street.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-moore?start=20,,,,,
21,Calli W.,"Oklahoma City, OK",104,3,,1.0,2016-03-20,"Did Chilis as a whole change their food for the worse or just this one? We've used the to-go services twice and both experiences with the food quality have been extremely disappointing. The chips were good, but the salsa (which is usually my favorite) has definitely changed over the past year, it was more like tomato sauce. We ordered the sirloin, asked for medium and it was definitely well done (glad I didn't order one well done.) Also the chicken crispers were an extremely poor excuse of chicken. They looked like chicken gizzards covered in sauce, yuck. And the loaded mashed potatoes were extremely bland, instant potatoes with shredded cheese on top...  I'm not sure if the dine in experience is any better but from reading other reviews it's not. Definitely won't be returning for a third time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-moore?start=20,,,,,

The one off of I-240 is probably the worst, and considering I gave them one star, I guess I'll give this one two since we've had a little better luck here than there. The Midwest City location has by far been the best with great service, every time we've gone with the exception of one very busy night. Such a shame because they actually have some good variety and tasty choices but the service is so typical of a chain. Bad management that isn't supervising their staff and quality of service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-moore,,,,,

22,Elizabeth W.,"Norman, OK",0,4,,2.0,2016-09-19,"What an odd start. The manager seated me and sat down across from me while taking my drink order. He gave me two appetizer menus instead of one normal one. I'm not sure if he was high or just stupid. He also did not dress for the job. He took my order instead of my waiter who I never saw but was told I would see. They did give me free chips and salsa so that was a plus. It looked as if the manager was the host, manager, and waiter, but he didn't do any of that very well. I wish I could have had a real waiter. The food was fairly good as usual at chilis. They gave me bone-in wings when they usually come boneless in a triple dipper and didn't ask me. That was pretty irritating. The food arrived promptly though and drink refills are regular. I wasn't checked on regularly after I received my food. This location is always odd, the chilis in Edmond is much better. I enjoy chilis in general but this one is always off, one way or another.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-moore?start=20,,,,,
12,Lisa B.,"Oklahoma City, OK",1,139,115.0,1.0,2017-03-24,"Well. I had to edit my 2 star review from 6 months ago to 1 star for this latest/last visit. Friday night. 8pm. 2 of us were sat a booth. He ordered the appetizer sampler. I order the 2 meat fajitas. Trying to stay low carb, in place of the rice and beans I requested broccoli & hesitantly the asparagus, only because I am pretty pick regarding asparagus. The waitress stated for the asp, it would be a dollar more. That combined with my slight worry, I chose double broccoli. Our meals were served. 1 of his 3 apps were incorrect, we never said anything. My broccoli however came out very obviously with brown highlights and raw. Several minutes later when our waitress returned I mentioned it. She promptly removed it, asked to replace it and took it to the kitchen. Approximately 10 minutes later she returned asking ""They didn't bring you your broccoli""? They had not, she was on it. She came back about a minute later stating they had made another batch and it was still brown. I was confused and said, it really shouldn't ever be brown, even before attempting to steam it. We laughed and she offered a double side of asp without the upcharge. I had about 3 bites left and asked how long she thought that would take considering I was nearly thru with my meal. She said about 3 minutes. I said sure (planning on putting it in a to-go box). She asked if there was anything else I needed and I said we would go ahead and take our tab. (He was done by this point). She said ok and added that she had asked the manager to stop by our table also. I said ok, thank you. About 1 minute later, a large man in a polo shirt with an ear piece walks up and slides a plate of broccoli on our table. I initially started to say, ""Oh our waitress has an order of asp being......."" when I was interrupted by him. As he throws his hands back over his shoulders and states ""I don't know anything about that"". I again attempt to explain when he interrupts again beginning to appear slightly agitated and says rather patronizingly, ""I went in the back and hand picked a bunch of fresh broccoli and cut it just for you so it would be green"".    :o     So they actually had fresh broccoli the entire time lol. He was obviously in a hurry and had no desire to ""smooth things over"" with us so I just said okay and thank you. Our waitress returns with the tab and says ""I see they brought you broccoli. I said yes. She hands me my tab and says that the mgr comped some of our food for us. I say thank you. Unfortunately between the broccoli still being raw a 2nd time (but green-yay!) and the amount the manager comped ($2.40) seeing as how I still hadn't received a double side........I had finally reached the end of my rope. I requested the waitress to have the manager return. I was ready for someone who might of been frustrated but not by any means what I was about to get. The manager appears. I start to talk and he immediately yet again starts talking over me. I then decide that didn't work for me last time so I put my hand up as if to say stop and state, ""You are a horrible manager. You should never talk over a customer like you consistently have when they have a valid complaint"". He places his hands on his hips and rolls his eyes and I then say ""In all actuality, the amount you've comped off our ticket is kind of a slap in the face. That is less than the cost of my iced tea. How much is a side""? He states ""1.99"". I then say, ""The least you could of done is comped 3.98 seeing as how I still have a plate of double raw broccoli"". Get this, no joke....He then reaches for our tab while yelling ""I don't have to listen to this!!!!"", crumples it up, throws it back across our table and continues yelling as he walks off, ""Your meals are on me""!!!  We were uh....in shock. It would be more understandable if he had been met with a hostile/rude customer but we never once  I raised our voices or used foul language. Our waitress and the other members of staff we came in contact with were phenomenal. The fajitas (beef & shrimp) were actually REALLY good but we absolutely could not believe that someone in customer service decided to act like that, much less a manager. Our waitress apologized for his outburst, we assured her it was not her fault, tipped her and left. We found out the managers name was Cisco.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-moore,,,,,

One person in the group got their appetizer about 30 minutes in and the rest of us spent another 30 minutes waiting. The food was okay but I was not impressed. I asked the server why it was taking so long to get a few apps and sides out and he said their were two large parties that came out in before us, even though of one the parties he was referring to sat down after us.  The server was nice enough, he seemed to be doing what he could with the large amount of people so I don't blame him for this experience.
