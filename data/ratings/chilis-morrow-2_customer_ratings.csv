We sat down at 9:06 by 10:12 nobody came to the table until my wife went to get someone.  Ok when a restaurant is short staffed that's when the mgr an employees turn it up. We didn't see that.

Finally, I was fed up and approach the manager to tell him of the terrible service. I left to go to TGIF; as I walked in the door, I was greeted with friendly staff and I was seated immediately. My waitress was great and the Grilled Shrimp with sautéed spinach and mushrooms was delicious.

Once we received our order we were not displeased; it was typical Chili's food and was good but after we got our change back we were shortchanged $20.  We paid with a $100 bill but that doesn't mean we're just oozing out cash and can afford to be taken advantage of by a waitress. It could have been a mistake but when we confronted her about it she said oh, you were supposed to get three $20 bills back instead of only two and quickly handed us another one which leads me to believe she very well knew she ""counted"" our change wrong.

This is my first time posting about it. The service is consistently good. Better than the Chili's in my hometown. Tonight I ate at the bar and service was good even though bar tender was busy. The food was EXCEPTIONAL! You know that commercial for Wal-Mart where they go to a high end restaurant and the give the customers steaks from Wal-Mart? And the customers are surprised by the quality and flavor of the steaks? That is what I experienced tonight! I typically get chicken or fish. Tonight I ordered the ""Lighter Choice Classic 6 oz Sirlion."" It was better than steaks I've had at the Stockyard in Nashville and the Cattlemen's Steakhouse & the State Line Steakhouse in El Paso!

In our experience we witnessed unprofessional behavior, incompetence and lack of knowledge of Chili's product and services. My husband and I placed an online order and went to pick it up in the store. Now everyone is familar with the 2 for $20  meal. This is w exactly what was ordered, an appetizer and 2 meals. Upon entering the restaurant the hostess was dancing like they were in a club. It was approximately 10:30pm and they closed at 12 am. When getting our food there was no appetizer and the hostess even said that the 2 for $20 did not come with an appetizer. Next, we went to use the chilis rewards to redeem a free dessert (cookie w/ice cream) and the hostess had no clue about what that even was. We stayed in the hotel right next door and when we got our food, it was poorly made and the cookie was STONE COLD. I ordered a bacon chicken quesadilla. There was hardly any bacon or chicken. I am very dissatisfied and disappointed. Not only that, I was charged for this ""free"" cookie. We didn't even eat it because of how cold it was. Anyways, if you are looking for a place to eat and are considering this joint, please, ABORT!!!! So, I called and spoke to a manager named Richie and he in fact confirmed that my meal should've came with an appetizer. Also, his reasoning for the cookie being cold was, they do not heat it up on to go orders because it will fall apart. This makes absolutely no sense. I then called my local Chili's and they said that they do heat up the cookie for a to go order. I am beyond done with this place.  All in all, he did offer a $10 chilis rewards.

I literally went back and forth with the girl at the to-go counter about the queso not being on the nachos and she claimed they don't put queso on any of their nacho dishes, even though the description on their website says otherwise. So, there was only ""meat"", ""cheese"" and tortilla chips (quotes are because I don't know if that's actually what those items were).  I had the smoked wings which were decent and I say decent for lack of a more mediocre word. We had a couple of other items and honestly I don't even feel like wasting any more of my time trying to describe the atrocity it was. Seriously the manager has given up here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-morrow-2,1.88,1.88,1.88,,1.88

I ordered steak fajitas well done with no green peppers. They brought me EXTRA green peppers with RAW steak. The good news it was dinner time and almost no customers, seems like poor service and horrible quality is catching up to them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-morrow-2?start=20,1.76,1.76,1.76,,1.7600000000000002
19,Demetria G.,"Morrow, GA",11,101,71.0,3.0,2016-07-22,"Date night with niece prevented much as I was too into her so phones up, no pics. Things didn't start well as we stood at the podium for more than 5 minutes not being greeted by anyone, which was surprising considering it was 5pm. I would have thought that at the start of Happy Hour they would be really paying attention to the door to get that money but at this location, guess not. Finally a manager walked up to ask if anyone was helping and finally sent someone over to seat us. The server was an older guy, who was decent enough to let us know that he was handling other customers but would be with us shortly. Made me feel a little more welcomed so since she had already decided what we were having by the time he came over we were ready to order food and beverages.  We ordered the $20 Dinner for 2 which includes an app and 2 entree's which includes choice of a side. Baby girl and I both went for the half rack of baby back ribs with regular bbq sauce, although he mentioned that they offered 4 types.   If memory served me correctly one was kind of spicy and the other was a Dr. Pepper, which he said taste just like the soda and another soda based type. For my side I chose loaded mashed potatoes which had cheese and bacon and she asked for more fries.. Not really thinking that would be a good taste on ribs from Chili's I passed. For the app we went with the  half order of Texas Cheese Fries, which comes in a hot skillet topped with jalapeno's, green onions and a side of what tasted like a watered down ranch but was not bad at all. My niece ordered a Shirley Temple and I opted for water with lemon. I am not sure if the bar made her drink of the server but first time I've ever seen one made w/out any cherries in the glass so we had to ask for cherries.  The pace of the meal was great but by the the time the entree's came we were both full from the fries because although it was a half order that little skillet was full of fries so we both were full. Overall for $20 it was a decent meal the ribs could have used more sauce as there was barely any and we had to ask for extra. The side of mashed was huge and looked like 2 large potatoes, it was over half of the plate so they didn't skimp on that at all. The ribs were tender but just basic nothing to brag about or crave again. Would I return probably not for food as chain restaurants aren't really my thing but it would be a good deal if you working on a budget for sure. The server was extremely polite and did everything right so no complaints from me on the level of service received.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-morrow-2,1.84,1.84,1.84,,1.8400000000000003

There were plenty of empty tables and when I asked if they were short staffed I was told ""no"". The manager informed us that they had 2 large parties (18 people) and she didn't want to seat people until their food was out. I asked if she would rather lose the business than seat us and she made no attempt to accommodate us. Needless to say we left and went to Joe's Crab Shack right up the street. We didn't have to wait there and spent over $150. Oh well, this Chili's didn't seem to need any business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-morrow-2?start=20,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04

We got seated and it took 10-15 minutes for someone to come to our table. The server was named Mercedes. We ordered everything then since we had waited so long to get helped. It took over 20 minutes to get our drinks and there was only 4 of them. My friend wanted Honey Jack and coke, no honey jack. Then he ordered just Jack and Coke, no Jack. He settled for Crown instead. My other two friends wanted the blueberry pineapple margarita, nope, don't have that either. One of them changed to beer and the other water. We ordered our food, the same guy that wanted the honey jack asked for a certain soup that was on the menu, nope, they're out(this is unreal) then he requested chick and steak fajitas, out of that too. Wait! Isn't this a restaurant? He settled for pulled pork. My other friend ordered plain salmon and they put seasonings on it, it was sent back but not before Mercedes copped an attitude and made an ugly face at my friend.When two of my other friends got their food, they requested their check be brought cause they had to leave soon, it was never brought. They tried to use that ""easy"" checkout machine on the table, it didn't work. They ended up having to get up and wait on someone to bring their check and boy, they were furious at this point. Is it this hard to get a bill? Lastly, I went to the ladies room and the stall was completely out of toilet paper but unfortunately I didn't realize this in time.  We all got up and left and no one said thank you, bye or kiss my butt. What a terrible terrible lunch outing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-morrow-2,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0
