130,Ryan P.,"Temecula, CA",358,92,66.0,2.0,2013-07-23,"I really wish I could give at least three stars - but the description for two stars: ""Meh, I've experienced better."" is exactly how I feel after tonight's meal.  First, let me state that their re-decorating looked amazing! I really had high hopes (as I hadn't been here since Nov 2011)! Their modern style was refreshing compared to their original dungy look. The hostess sat us (my 11 year old son and I) immediately and announced who our server would be. Brandy soon arrived at our table and introduced herself. She was very nice and polite and attentive. She took our drink orders and came back promptly with them. We needed a little extra time to look over the menu so she left us for a few minutes. My son and I decided to try their ""2 for $20"" deal. Seemed like a sure thing. We decided on the chips and fire-roasted corn guacamole as our shared appetizer. Good choice! The guac was flavorful and we also had salsa too! Great start! So our entrees came out and they looked amazing! Our food was so hot and fresh! I ordered their Classic Bacon Burger with a side of the fries. I also asked for a side of ranch (for my fries). My son ordered the 6oz. sirloin with steamed broccoli and loaded mashed potatoes. My entree selection: The burger was cooked perfectly! The bacon was a bit overcooked for my liking but not ""horrible"". The burger did seem to have an ""abundance"" of shredded lettuce - a bit too much, in my opinion. Overall though, the burger was good. My fries though - not so great. They were piping hot but overly salty. They were fried to a perfect crispness - but the seasoning was overpowering. Eh...Oh yeah, my side of ranch was forgotten - so I had to remind our server. My son's entree selection: He steak was grilled perfectly as ordered (medium well). My son was raving about his steak! So much that he begged me to have a bite! So of course I did! Whoa! Salt City, USA! That steak had so much salt - I don't understand how my son could eat it! The steamed broccoli was flavorful - but over seasoned with pepper. The loaded mashed potatoes were just average, at best. They were piping hot but seemed 'old' (as if they had been sitting in a steamtable pan for several hours). The service was acceptable. The server continued to refill our drink selections (my son ordered the strawberry lemonade; I ordered the blackberry iced tea) throughout our meal. I noticed several other servers and hotesses walking about the restaurant and all of them seemed genuinely happy. Smiles and warm welcomes greeted every guest! Can't have too high of expectations from a chain restaurant; I expected to give at least three stars but the food drove the rating down to two stars.

First people who checked in after us with the exact same number in the party got seated before us, next the waitress got our drink order wrong twice when all it was, was all water & one soda, then we had ordered a 2 for 20 deal and on our appetizer we got chips and guacamole, the waitress asked us if we wanted a refill on our chips & guacamole, but then brought us chips & salsa we politely said we had guacamole not salsa, and she said oh there is no refills on guacamole, which is fine but why did she specifically say would you like more chips and guacamole? Then she said well let me get our manager, at this point we were still being nice just explaining our issue, the manager then said no one refills guacamole here and if they do they'll be fired, I thought he was being a little extreme by saying that. So we then said let us just pay for our salads and don't worry about bringing the rest of our food out. He then gave us a very dirty look. And was rude as we left. I work in retail and I would never be rude to customers or down grade another employee in front if customers.

When we were seated it was about 10 min before someone even acknowledged our existence.  A waiter from another section came by to take our drink order and told us that our server would be by soon.  Another 10 min went buy before that happened.  We ordered and didn't see our waitress again until our food was brought out. We ordered the pretzel stick appetizer.  I know that it is becoming standard practice for these types of chains to have frozen appetizers, but its getting a little out of hand.  The pretzels and cheese were acceptable, just shy of ok, and far from good.  I ordered a bacon ranch quesadilla.  I would have been better off at taco bell it probably would have been less greasy.  The quesadilla itself was void of any sort of flavor.  The only thing that had flavor was the pepper ranch and it was still weak.  My wife's fajitas were undercooked and almost cold when they came to the table. Our waitress was absolutely horrible.  I can take bad food or poor service, but not both.  we weren't given any napkins or place settings when our appetizers were brought out.  When we requested them, they were thrown at us as the waitress hurried past our table.  When our entrees came, they too were thrown at us.  When the waitress brought refill for our drink, she put enough force into it, so that the one drink slid halfway across the table to collide with the previous one.

I mentioned my predicament to the bartender and immediately he gave me attitude as if I was in the wrong. He requested the manager and she made me wait fifteen minutes before coming to speak with me. Finally she came up to me and instead of welcoming me with a positive attitude I was given the look of someone who felt bothered. It was as if I had been deemed a complete burden and that me informing her about my poor service was a nuisance to her. She told me she would ""see what she could do"". After waiting yet another ten minutes, she returned stating that she will take five dollars off my fifty dollar tab. Needless to say I will never be returning to chili's again!

Service is a hit or miss... We've been here on two separate occasions. The first time it wasn't so good and this time it was ok. We went for lunch, it wasn't crowded or busy, and the server was nice. She came to check up on us a few times and was good. Nothing on her. The food on the other hand was bleh... My husband ordered a burger and he said it was good. I ordered the an entree dish with a beef taco, tostada, rice, beans, and enchilada, and it was bleh. The flavor was bland and all I could taste was the cumin. Presentation looked like they just plopped it on the plate. The last time we were here my husband got a burger as well and I got the salmon entree. And we felt the same way about the food. It seems like there's something missing. Overall, I wouldn't want to come back again. Not for the food anyway. The service was good. Greeted at the door and was attentive checking up on us.

Ordered a beer, went to the restroom to wash my hands after work, came back and my beer looked like someone had taken a big swig from it.  I 'tounge-in-cheek' asked the bartender if she was drinking my beer.   Her response was serious though, ""I can't fill it because I'm not allowed to.""  ""We can only fill it  till the head hits the top of the glass."" So, when I came back from washing my hands, the head had settled to the point that it looked like several oz. were missing.  Really?  And you won't give me what you advertise (16oz beer) or even appease an inquisitive customer.  Not going back.  It had been years since I'd been in this location anyway and after all that time, this was my 'comeback' experience.  I won't miss it.

I asked her why they weren't in kids cups and her reply was ""Big kids usually drink the small cups pretty fast, and I don't have time for all those refills"" This alone shocked me, but trying to be understanding we went with it.  We then waited an hour for our food. I know this happens with bigger parties as I had been a server for many years.

We let Heather know it was cold, and she offered to warm it up in the microwave. This is not okay.

34,Serrano S.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",3,46,75.0,1.0,2017-05-19,"My birthday dinner ruined! I saved a place in line for our fam of 6 via app. We checked in. We're told it would be another 15-20 minutes. They sat a few parties ahead of us while we were there (parties of 4 and 5) they finally called us... showed us a table in the middle surrounded by everyone (I have a 4 yr old) we automatically said NO. We seen another table (people had just walked out, table was dirty) told them we wanted that one. Manager walked over and told us he'd clean it right up for us right away... They made us wait by waiting area again(we thought hat was odd) we were waiting awhile... they then call a party of 2, then another party of 6. That fam of 6 also didn't want the table we first got offered, then we see them automatically sit them down on the table we were waiting for to be cleaned! (It was clean now) None of the staff including the manager  acknowledged us! It took for my husband to ask what the hell happened to our table. The two employees were speechless. I asked to speak to the manager, that told us he'd have THAT table cleaned for US!! they paged him, he came right over, and swore up and down that the fam was ahead of us! And if they weren't that table would of been ours!! Uuummmmm NO...That was a lie! They were caucasian and we are chicanos (in a restaurant full of Caucasians) we felt discriminated, that family basically wanted that table(that we were waiting patiently for them to clean) and they got it no IFS AND OR BUTS!! we were left waiting like idiots for them to clean a table... then lie that the other family was ahead of us! Let me say something... if that family was ahead of us... they would of gotten called BEFORE US... we were waiting for over 30 minutes! That family sat down to wait right after another party got called to be seated... they had been sitting there the entire time until they called them AFTER THEY CALLED US... FIRST!!! so to be lied to, ignored, and discriminated against... we walked out! Horrible experience... ever!!! We were all hungry and tired... my day went from being great... to being ruined!

However the services Chili's murrieta are horrible from the lazy hosting and the poor bussing. The vary slow service was not helpful either. We sat down to we order our food at the same time as our drinks almost an hour later our food came out. Now I am not one to write a bad review I am a business owner I know how important reviews are.

65,David L.,"Wildomar, CA",0,7,,1.0,2017-07-20,"If you go to this restaurant, be sure to get an itemized receipt showing the individual meals and drinks they say you bought, before you pay for anything. I went with two other family members and we each ordered modestly-priced meals and no drinks. At the end of the meal when the amount we owed was displayed on the table-top electronic device, it was higher than I thought it should be. But the only amount the device would display and print was the total amount; it didn't list the individual meals we were being billed for. I asked the waitress for a menu and an itemized bill, and she brought me both. The itemized bill (which she had to go get from someplace other than the table-top device) listed a 4th meal that we had not ordered and had never been brought to our table. I pointed that out to the waitress and she took that meal off the bill, claiming some other server must have somehow gotten on to her account and put that 4th meal on. If I hadn't done some math in my head before the bill came, I never would have discovered the overcharge. It strikes me as more than coincidence that not only was I overcharged, but they didn't give me an itemized bill showing the overcharge until I asked for it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-murrieta-2?start=60,2.72,2.83,2.83,,2.7860000000000005

12,Gloria B.,"Murrieta, CA",4,59,73.0,4.0,2017-09-11,"We like Chili's but wish it was spelled correctly with an ""e"" at the end, in Spanish. Our faves are the agave margarita, mixed to perfection and accompanied with the steel shaker on the side. So it's like getting 2 of them. The dry rub ribs are always crispy on the outside, moist inside without all the sugar in a sauce and sticky fingers. Just our preference. Mango chicken dinner is satisfying, love their quesadillas and quesadilla salad is great. Don't order the pre-fixed guacamole as it has too much lime to keep it from turning dark, which overwhelms the avocado flavor. Next time we will try the hand made one at the table so we can control how much lime goes into it. Everything we've had has been good for a chain restaurant.

18,P M.,"Murrieta, CA",0,13,,1.0,2017-10-24,"One of the worst customer service experiences at a restaurant ever!  I have been to this location before and was very disappointed but I thought I would give it another try.  It was about 4:10 pm and the place was pretty much empty, maybe 5 or 10 people in the whole restaurant.  Almost every table was available.  I waited for someone to acknowledge us and eventually a hostess came by and ask how many (2) and she said she would be right back.  I waited, and waited, and waited but she was nowhere in sight.  In the meantime, numerous servers walked by and didn't even acknowledge me, or ask if I was being helped.  I finally saw the hostess chatting with one of the servers but she was in no rush to get back to me.  I was just about to leave when the hostess returned just as I was ready to leave.  I was pretty upset so far about the service but decided to just relax and enjoy my meal.  After being seated and reviewing the menu we waited for a server to take our order because there were so many around, but no such luck.  A few people came in and so now there were 3 tables in the entire area with customers.  The people that came after me were greeted by their server and again I was becoming frustrated.  Finally a server came by and took our drink order and said she would be right back.  By now we have been there for a 1/2 hour, at 4:40 pm and the place was still pretty much empty.  We waited and waited and after seeing our server having a conversation with a few guys, then leaning over to kiss him, I was seething.  Oh no, wait.. it gets better.  Then she sat down with them.  I was done, shocked that a owner or manager would allow this type of service.  Maybe they didn't care about one customer, maybe they lost a lot more. I have had amazing service and food at other Chili's locations. No wonder their parking lot is always empty.  You don't see that at any other location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-murrieta-2,3.12,2.95,2.95,,3.0180000000000007
