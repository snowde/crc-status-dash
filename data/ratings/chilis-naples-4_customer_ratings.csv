22,Cameron D.,"Cape Coral, FL",0,7,,3.0,2014-05-24,"We came to this Chili's a couple days after it opened recently. It wasn't busy when we got there but it was packed towards the end of our meal. So packed that they gave our table to a group of people before we were even ready to leave. The people came and stood behind us and waited for a few minutes until we got up. We were really uncomfortable.. Our waitress was obviously new to waitressing but we expected that since it's a new restaurant. My food was really good, not overcooked at all. The fajitas are always good at Chili's! These things on the table are like little tablets that you can look through the menu on and pay your bill with your card on your own. You can also see a running tab. It's pretty cool. Our experience was good overall, we were just feeling really awkward from the people hovering over us thing. Also it is pretty inaccessible due to the way you have to drive into the parking lot from a certain direction.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-naples-4?start=60,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998

HOWEVER, my intent is for this review to be seen by the GM to please do something with you staff. The service is terrible!! Every time I visit, whether busy or not, it takes forever to get acknowledged, takes forever for meals to come, once they are, the waitress NEVER checks on you. The hostess has a bad attitude and acts like you're troubling her because she has to put her phone down to seat you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-naples-4?start=60,2.056,2.056,2.056,2.056,2.056

We took a seat at high top.  We sat there for a five minutes and a server passed by and said she would be right with us.  After some more time, another server (the bartender) came to take our order.  She seemed a little overwhelmed which is normal but when a salad comes out before appetizers that we had been waiting for for 40 minutes or so is not.   I'm going to cut this short.  Lunch should not take 2 1/2 hours.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-naples-4?start=20,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000002,1.9600000000000004

I called the hotline again and was told to await a call from the GM once again, to which I replied negatively since I REFUSE to wait another month, and instead asked for the regional manager's phone number. I was informed that they do NOT give out numbers, to just WAIT. This company is terrible. Never have I seen a company where you are not allowed to call someone, they will call YOU. Mind you this entire thing is based on discrimination towards one of the people in our party. You would think they would act faster when such a sensitive subject is the issue.

It is located near the I-75 and SR951.  We were sitting immediately. The Chili Restaurant has new menu and new items. I have tried their shrimp taco. And my friend has lunch special with club turkey with Texas toast and the soup. We also order the drink by starting with the strawberry lemonade the refill with mango ice tea. We love do it when we go to any Chili since we pay one price for the drink and change different flavor in the middle of the meal.  The shrimp tacos suppose to be grilled but they are white which mean not on the grill for too long. I think because of that I have bad stomach along the trip. The service is a bit slow in this location during lunch time. Usual lunch crowd want a hassle waitress so they can get back to work. I believe there is a lot improvement need to be done here so I have given them 3 stars.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-naples-4,1.6760000000000002,1.6760000000000002,1.6760000000000002,1.6760000000000002,1.6760000000000002

We initially ordered the Mountain Melt-wannabe , (boneless chicken smothered in jack cheese with bacon and chives) it was OK. Our drinks were served promptly, and that is where this experience took a turn. After ordering our entrees consisting of a burger and fish tacos, we waited for a solid 30 minutes without anyone coming by our table again. After that time, the manager stopped by to inform us that it will be just a bit longer and he wasn't sure what was going on with our food. Ok... 10 minutes more and I grabbed the manager (as the server hadn't stopped by once since taking our order), he informed me that the burger had been cooked incorrectly twice.. I mean how difficult is it to cook a medium burger? And I could only imagine what the fish tacos looked like after being under a heating lamp that whole time.

The hostess was friendly though not warm and welcoming.   Our server was average and seemed a bit distracted. She was however very knowledgeable of the menu. When I ordered a tall draft, she asked if I would rather have two for one. After further clarification it turns out they must be short Pilsner glasses. So I took the two smells for one. That would be fine except that she brought out both at the same time. That means one draft sits and waits on the other which in the draft world is not a good thing.  I had the fish tacos. They were excellent even if the server who brought them out was distracted, hurried and seemed uncaring.  Overall, the food was delicious.

54,Don H.,"Naples, FL",4,38,25.0,3.0,2016-05-13,Unbelievable all the bad reviews are most likely true this location is near my house and Chili's is one of the chains that I usually enjoy So because of its location and I was mad hungry I had to try it as I was sitting at the table I read the reviews I couldn't really believe them because I've eaten at Chili's dozen times and it was always good I probably only like five or six chain restaurants and Chili's is one that I really like my waiter was great excellent service ice cold tea guacamole on the table in three minutes flat and my lunch bowl ready in 10 minutes That was the good now the bad which is everything salsa sucks imagine catsup salt and tomato purée. guacamole was just a plain almost rotten avocado mashed up then the pesto chili lunch bowl The chicken had to be some process extra salt frozen crap it looks like tofu it didn't even look like chicken I didn't even finish half my meal and I had a stomachache and a headache and I threw my leftovers away now I'm a power eater i almost never do that. I rarely leave negative ratings because I don't want to hurt Restaurants business but this is a chain and it was bad enough that it doesn't bother me to leave a negative review usually I just skip it and I only go to the positive places I thought Chili's had some type of consistency either things have changed or individual owners  can outsource their dumpster for their food Save your money and your stomach just keep on driving,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-naples-4,1.76,1.76,1.76,2.0600000000000005,1.7600000000000002

That was the last time we saw our server . Food took an hour and everything was cold , the cheese over my chicken was like wax and tasted stale , had a salad As well  my Lettuce was wilted and my wife had a fajita and was so dry she couldn't eat it .. This is a new chilis and were so under staffed . Front of house can not be to blame besides not acknowledging the tables after the shit hit the fan . Ignored us by all means . Waited 30 minutes to get out check , contemplated walking out but since we are all in the industry we understood . The HOSTESS  came by and apologized and had no idea what to say she was frazzled . Took off half our food , we didn't eat a bite . Was so terrible.

59,Chef N.,"Naples, FL",0,48,,1.0,2016-07-19,"We use to enjoy Chili's of 4-5 years ago. The atmosphere of the old outdoes the new in our opinion. The one in Oviedo, FL comes to mind. Loved that place.  The quality of this Chili's - food and service - has gone down IMO. This is now a non-starter for us.  We have had bad experiences with cold and little meat ribs. Soggy fries. In addition, we even had old lettuce in their salads and problems with an all but a raw burger on one visit. Service is slow and at times with an attitude. Their manager is friendly though and tries to do the right thing. 01/10/2017 We were in the area so we decided to try them again - hoping they had changed. THEY HAVEN'T. We received the wrong appetizer. The server asked if we were sure we desired to send it back, as it would be 10 minutes to get another one. We were shocked! I said, I was absolutely 100% sure we desired to send it back. I added the appetizer is not as we ordered it. We desire it as ordered. We received it back approximately 10 minutes later. It was wrong again. We gave up and just scraped off the ingrediates I'm allergic too. I ate two bites, it was bad.  Tried the ribs again. They had more meat on them this time, but no sauce. I told the server there was not enough sauce on the ribs and then showed him the lack of sauce on the ribs. He then asked, ""Do you want more sauce with those ribs?"" I answered ""yes."" He said he would get some immediately. Five minutes later and 1/2 of the ribs eaten the sauce arrived.  My wife tried the buffalo chiken. The sauce was bad and the salad had shrunk in size from previous visits. Paying the bill, with a coupon, was an experience too. Don't ask - it's too complicated to explain - no wait, that was the server's line (literally). We figured it out on our own.  We would have normally contacted the manager, but at this location we have noted that it does no good. Of course, at the Chili's in Oviedo we never had to contact the manager. It was always a great meal, and served without an attitude.  So, to all you once Chili's fans in the Naples area, this is not the old Chili's you once knew.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-naples-4,1.72,1.72,1.72,,1.7200000000000002

Same management, same problems only worse than last time. Food order was wrong, asked for no tomato on flatbread-server came out with it with tomato and told me the manager said to bring it out and maybe I would still want it-not too bright. Managed to mess up the other food order. Was told a new flatbread would take 7-10 minutes-it took 20 and came out too well done. Then they took off only one of the meals that they messed up-not both. Again I emailed the main headquarters to complain. Only saving grace was I got gift certificates to us which I did at my local Chillis (Bethpage, NY) which has much better service and they do not mess up your order!

First of all the place was very clean and the hostess was nice and seated us immediately. Our waitress also showed up Quickly - between minutes we had beverages.  We ordered an appetizer which also came out in a decent time and was pretty good. We played trivia on the table tablets and had a good time while we waited for our food.  Our food came out and it was piping hot and tasted pretty darn good. I ordered a steak bowl, my kids burgers, and the husband sirloin steak. We paid our bill on the tablet and were on 75 in 45 minutes.
