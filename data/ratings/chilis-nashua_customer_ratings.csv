21,Dave D.,"Merrimack, NH",67,42,34.0,2.0,2012-07-08,"The food at Chili's has always been respectable and the service varied by time of day/week and who was on staff.  Lately though, the service has been horrendous. All aspects of the service experience are very slow and sub par.  Greeting time, initial welcome, order taking, food arrival, and even take out are crazy slow.  The wait staff isn't even aware of which soups they serve. Perhaps you can try another Chili's, but avoid the one on Amherst St.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nashua?start=20,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152

19,James W.,"Montreal, Canada",32,192,64.0,4.0,2014-01-01,"This was my first meal in the US during my Christmas trip, and I was really satisfied, mainly with the service. I ordered a sirloin, requested medium-rare, and my girlfriend had the grilled chicken and avocado sandwich. Food came fast, and the service was really efficient and prompt. When my steak arrived, the waitress asked me to cut it so that I could make sure it was cooked to my liking. When I did, I found out that the meat was more than well-done. The waitress said she will be right back with another steak. So I started to eat the sides (she didn't take back my plate), hoping the steak would come in no-time. Then she showed up with a full plate: steak, mashed potatoes, and veggies. She apologized for the long wait and asked me to cut into the steak again; it was perfectly cooked. When I asked for the bill, the waitress said that since they made me wait for the steak dish, it was on the house. WHAT?! That's what I call good service, it's not about the money, but about how much you care. Good job Chili's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nashua,,,,,
23,Curtis S.,"Nashua, NH",24,31,51.0,4.0,2014-04-25,Morgan the waitress was fantastic. Excellent  advice on menu items and mood choosing food. This was a great evening and the food/drinks were amazing.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nashua?start=20,,,,,
25,Ron J.,"Rochester, NH",16,43,13.0,2.0,2014-06-01,"Okay so I typically love this place! Great chips and salsa, great burgers. This time is was out of bounds. The salsa was soupy and when we asked the server she said ""it's been coming out like that all day""?? Okay, so who's fixing it? So no salsa, and when I get my burger which I was so hungry I was like finally! Right as I took my first bite, I noticed a big hair in the burger... I spit my food out and told the server.. Here is the kicker, when the manger walked over she asked if I was unhappy how my burger was cooked? I was yeah, I prefer it be shaven!! The server didn't even tell the manager the story. The manager did do a great job taking care of us and we will try it again but left today hungry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nashua?start=20,,,,,
20,Taylor L.,"Merrimack, NH",62,237,107.0,2.0,2014-10-26,"I've been here several times at several different locations, this being the closest to our house. We decided to stop here for a quick bite and a margarita. Being that it's Sunday night around 9, it was pretty empty. We stood and waited at the front for at least 10 minutes before we were actually acknowledged and sat. They have a new system that allows you to order food and drinks, reorder drinks, play games and pay which really eliminated the need for the waitress aside from running the food. She was extremely unattentive, didn't even tell us about the tablet system or ask if we'd seen it and she didn't even bring us our food. The restaurant itself isn't very clean, the food was just ok and the bathrooms reeked of urine the second I walked in. After this trip, I think I'll be avoiding this place. The idea of tablets in place of a waitress isn't a bad concept if it was implemented in a better fashion and if the waitresses still kept up great customer service, which they didn't.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nashua?start=20,,,,,
16,Oliver K.,"Manchester, NH",1,49,,1.0,2014-12-14,I ordered a chili and when I got it I was not impressed at all. The chili was basically just a soup very very little meat n beans. I complained and it took the server about 5 mins to have it fixed. I believe they cooked up some hamburger and added it to the chili soup. I would not recommend getting chili from chili's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nashua,,,,,
17,Eric L.,"Nashua, NH",0,23,,2.0,2014-12-22,Simple fast food. Not authentic by any means. However if you are in the mood for good not great apps and an ice cold beer while watching the game on many TV's in the bar then this place has merit. Don't forget that this is a national chain that serves IQF beef and fish with bagged salads. You get what you pay for. Still a good place for a cold beer after work. Service is standard for this type of restaurant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nashua,,,,,
13,Laura B.,"Londonderry, NH",0,34,2.0,3.0,2015-03-12,"I've been here many times and have had different experiences. The first time I sat in the dining room - I wouldn't recommend doing that. Service was painfully slow and not busy in the restaurant at all. What brought me back was the food. There were New Mexican dishes which allowed you to create your own combo and they tasted very good. So next time I sat in the bar area. I recommend this even if you don't drink like I don't. First time the server was quick but seemed annoyed, didn't smile, and was very abrupt. Second time I had Janet who has become a favorite. Personable, attentive, and accurate describe her service. One time sat right at the bar as no tables were available. Casey the bartender is awesome. Super personality, quick, and great menu recommendations were given by him. New Year's Day I had the best service ever from a server who was so happy and pleasant. She was a delight and I feel so bad I don't remember her name - this wasn't a weekday or time I'd ever been here.  The food - your best bet is the happy hour special. Many appetizer specials at low prices and all taste great. Order two and it's a full meal. Regular menu items are hit or miss. Some are a bit pricey like the burgers. The food just isn't the same since all the changes. It's eh at best.  My suggestion - Come here sit in the bar, ask for Janet or Casey, and order from the happy hour menu. I believe it's m-f 3-6pm and 9-close. It's been about a month since I was here so happy hour may have changed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nashua,,,,,

11,Muffin M.,"Nashua, NH",0,6,2.0,4.0,2015-10-15,(good part) Me and my mom just got out and my experience was good my Cajon chicken pasta was delicouse and the waiter was nice and welcoming also when I asked for a refill my drink came in about 15 seconds also the ziosk made it much easier for us to pay instead of waiting about 15 mounts to pay  (bad part) the bottom cushon on our booth kept coming off and I had to get up from my seat several of times to fix it and put it back in its place. (recommendation) a small reccomendation is to fix the seat other wise then chillies is perfect,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nashua,,,,,

0,Sue M.,"Stamford, CT",37,209,481.0,4.0,2016-09-11,"Had dinner here last night with my husband after we finished an 8 hour hike in Franconia. We were driving back to Connecticute after the hike (4 hour drive) and stopped in to have dinner. Needless to say, we were exhausted, famished, and just beaten. We were in our hiking clothes and a little embarrassed to walk in the way we were looking. After we finished the meal, we realized we could not have picked a better spot for the dinner! Our waitress, Jenn, was the sweetest waitress ever. She was extremely accomodating, understood we were super thirsty and kept the waters coming. We had the chicken tortilla soup, the buffalo wings and the carribean salad and santa fe salad. All of the food was goood. The chicken wings were perfect, we made another order before we left. Great and relaxing experience.  Would def go back if in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nashua,,,,,

7,Brian L.,"Merrimack, NH",37,29,32.0,3.0,2017-03-09,"This location seems to have a good staff, the place is clean, and the food was prepared in a timely manner. We had cheese covered boneless chicken for an appetizer,  a burrito,  and a quesideo.  Lots of cheese on the boneless chicken, small amount of bacon and green onion.  Good, not a lot of flavor for having the toppings that were there though. Burrito was a very generous size and plenty of toppers. Served with some tasty beans.The same thought though, not a lot of flavor for some many things with it. The sauce on top was the flavor savor. The quesideo was really prepared well and again just simple flavors. The toppings served with it gave all the flavor.  Overall, they had a great staff, timely service, and good food. My taste buds would have liked a little more flavor from the dishes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nashua,,,,,
2,Panagiotes P.,"Amherst, NH",1,3,,2.0,2017-05-25,"I forget how much this place sucks so I hope by memorializing our experience last night it will help me remember and think twice the next time Chill's becomes an option for eating out. We arrived at 8 PM on a Wed night to find the place dead and proceeded to take a seat in the bar so we could theoretically be seen and therefore get better service. My wife orders the same thing every time, a fajita salad without the chicken because she's a vegetarian and tonight I opted for fajitas, pretty simple order. The bartender was prompt, we ordered everything in one shot including a small appetizer. The appetizer and drinks came out promptly, the rest... came too late. It took over a half an hour for the server to finally get back to us to confess that the kitchen had messed up my wife's salad and tossed in the chicken, so they're making a new one. Which also meant they were making a new one for me too because it had gotten cold. We don't receive our meals until about 45m after we sit down, at which point I lost my appetite to the drinks and appetizer. Now I just want to get out of here, get some boxes and go. Getting boxes to use took over 5m in this place that was visibly empty. It get's better, she apologizes for the problem and comps me the appetizer but they screwed up and charged us full price for the salad for chicken we never got! Before that, on a Friday night. I put in my order and then they tell me 25m later that they're out of steak. Have you ever been to a restaurant that is run so poorly that they run out of steak on a Friday night?! If you really want to cross that off your bucket list then come here!!! There's more I can't remember, maybe its my minds way of protecting itself. I don't know. What I do know is that I don't want any more memories of this place. I could blame this service on the front of the house, or the back... but what this really comes down to is bad management, from the top down. The place needs a new owner. Stay away guys, Uno's is right across the street and a much better experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nashua,,,,,

4,John L.,"Milford, NH",0,10,,2.0,2017-08-27,"Went there a week and a half ago. I ordered a cheeseburger with onion rings and my daughter ordered the steak fajitas. When our order came out I was given french fries instead of what I ordered - onion rings. No big deal, the server was good and attentive. When I got the bill it was $36! I thought that was outrageous, seeing how we didn't order bar drinks and I got literally 5 onion rings...which were over cooked. The fajitas were slightly burned too. The food was decent, but nothing to write home about. I won't be returning. For the money spent here you could do much better 1/2 mile up the road.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nashua,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
6,Jillian A.,"Merrimack, NH",0,2,,1.0,2017-09-01,"Every single time we've ordered to-go from this chilis, they've messed up the order. They send us gift cards to make up for it so we've ended up going back if we feel like it, and they continue to mess up the order. It's incredible that a restaurant can mess up someone's order that much. Tonight they messed up the order once again!

3,Shay P.,"Tyngsborough, MA",0,3,,1.0,2017-09-02,"Worst experience! When we arrived the place seemed pretty dead yet we waited to get greeted by a host who let us know it'd only be a few minutes while they cleaned up some tables. After waiting for ten minutes we got seated. That wasn't too bad but it just went down hill from there. Our server came over to us and instead of asking how we were doing she thought it was a good idea to inform us how she was ""getting slammed"" and getting her ""butt kicked"". She brought our drinks (forgot the straws). We ordered bar drinks and waited over 15 minutes for them. After waiting almost an hour  we finally got our food which was cold and looked like it had been sitting. At that point we were just too hungry to complain. We closed our check on the ziosk and left with the plans of a never return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nashua,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56

1,Brenda E.,"Nashua, NH",28,1,2.0,1.0,2017-11-14,"This Chili's is poorly managed and disgusting.   Recently we ordered some salads for pickup. Upon arriving about 15 minutes past the pickup time, the salads were not ready. Once we opened the salads back at our work, we found that $12 salads were in a side salad container.  Called back the restaurant who said they would credit the card - only after getting the run around about how the salads were packaged properly.   Yesterday the dm spoke to me and assured me that a credit would be placed on the acct.  This is after a week had now come and gone and no credit has been placed on my acct.   (still no credit).   Today I was contacted from someone at the restaurant asking if we would like complimentary salads.  Of course I agreed since I do love their salads and I was happy that they were trying to turn a poor experience into a positive one.   HOWEVER upon going to eat the salad, a bug crawled out to say hello.   Nice joke Chili's people. You really got me with this one.  I will NEVER visit this establishment again and I hope that someone can hire new help that can effectively run a business because this is NOT the way to do business!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-nashua,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
