261,Joanna Y.,"Lawrence, KS",182,231,73.0,1.0,2012-01-07,"Let me just start by saying that I genuinely wish I liked this place. My life would be so much easier because many of my friends enjoy Chili's and we all live within a mile of this location. That being said... First visit: I visited this Chili's with a friend in hopes of partaking in their Happy Hour. The selection of choices was pretty limited but I settled on a margarita, taking the $4 price heavily into consideration. We had situated ourselves in the bar, figuring this would lead to pronto service. WRONG WRONG WRONG. It took the waitress 15 minutes to take our order, another twenty to bring the drink out. I might have ordered another but she NEVER came back to our table. An hour after my drink had been consumed, we had to work at getting the waitresses attention to get the bill. Being as I am in food service myself, I am usually quite patient and understanding with with waitstaff. However, the duration of the wait for her was unbearable and I wanted nothing more than to vacate this Chili's ASAP. Never before in my life have I not tipped a waiter. She was the first, and so far, the only. Second visit: this time I was here with a group of chums, CSUN students, 9 people. Our drink orders were taken promptly, and delivered just as quick. I was relieved, hoping my second experience would highly outscore the first. That is, until I saw a mutilated slice of LEMON in my Blue Moon. Everyone knows that Blue Moon is served with an orange slice. Sounds picky, but the orange adds to the flavor of the brew, and lemon definitely distracts from it. Fine. I took the lemon out and drank anyway. I had ordered their club sandwich and since it comes with ham and turkey, asked for it to be made without the ham. What should have arrived was a sandwhich with turkey, bacon, lettuce, avocado, and tomato. What actually came was bread with turkey and bacon. The end. I asked the waitress if I could also have the veg that was supposed to accompany the meat to which she obliged. However, when the bill came I was charged for the ""extra"" veg. *sigh....  Bottom line, I am always the first to veto this Chili's location in favor of ANYTHING else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-northridge?start=260,2.52,2.52,2.52,2.244,2.52

We used to live nearby this particular one, and would frequent there but its been awhile now since we have step foot in there....until the other day.  I dont understand how a chain restaurant with the same menus and ingredients, can taste different from each other. Take In N Out for instance, they are consistently similar in taste (which is aweseome) no matter which In N Out you go to.  How do you even mess up fries???? Fries are pretty much, simple enough to make but yet these guys find a way to blow it..... This Chili's is by far a huge disappointment.

256,Tim M.,"West Hollywood, CA",32,43,3.0,4.0,2012-04-04,"Oh chain restaurants.  They're an interesting beast aren't they?  When a chain is as large as Chili's they've gotta be doing something right.  Right?  Here's my issue with reviewing chains, most people have at least tried them once or twice before. They already have an opinion about that specific chain in their minds before entering.  Chili's for some reason gets an Olive Garden reaction.  People are either pleased with what they get or they detest its very existence.  For me, Chili's in general has always been a restaurant that serves higher quality bar food.  Nothing special, nothing fancy.  Just simple and for the most part good. As for this Chili's, well I've been going here about once every six weeks or so for a year and a half and I really have very few complaints.  As far as Chili's food goes, it's plenty good.  I LOVE the queso dip and the mini burgers.  The cajun pasta (both shrimp and chicken) has that perfect kick (although the shrimp one is a little lacking in terms of the shrimp.  Need to cut all of them in half to have a decent amount)  The chicken ranch quesodilla is yummy and that oreo desert thing they have is nut-yourself-delicious.  Happy hour is a great deal here.  Bartenders and servers are generally pretty nice.  Granted on busier nights service tends to slack.  But hey, you get a REALLY friendly greet, then you don't see them again unless they're refilling your drinks until it's time for the check and then they're REALLY friendly again.  So it might not be the most attentive, but I'm never left wanting and the two interactions I get are REALLY friendly. Like I said, Chili's food is good for what it is.  This restaurant has never messed up an order for me and have actually come through in a pinch I found myself in (hosting a BBQ and didn't get A1!!!  I ran in asking if I could buy one bottle and they just gave it free.  I brought friends in for drinks later that week as a thank you).  They only get 4 stars because Chili's food really is just higher quality bar food.  But when you're in the mood for it, it's freakin' perfect.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-northridge?start=240,2.64,2.64,2.64,2.512,2.64

192,Vvn W.,"Van Nuys, CA",63,546,30.0,1.0,2012-09-18,"Ack...Chili's used to be better than this. I had a snacking for some chicken fajitas and since I was in the area & it was supper time, I came here to satisfy my nagging craving.  I envisioned a sizzling platter of juicy grilled chicken, fresh veggies, and fresh guacamole/salsa.  Didn't get anything near that unfortunately. This Chili's has been here since forever and it has certainly went downhill.  The section that I was seated was quite dirty; the booths were covered with food pieces with tables uncleared.  There was even food on the floor where it was stepped on by unknowing patrons. Here's the bit about my fajitas: it was lousy.  Way too much oil was used where the veggies were swimming in it and the chicken itself was very bland.  I was only given a few pieces of chicken but nearly the entire platter was full of greasy produce.  The side of guacamole and sour cream were on the ""old"" side.  I ate as much as I could but left most of the dish untouched.  Wasn't worth the price it was tagged at. Don't know what happened to the this Chili's.  It used to be the hot spot for college students to gather.  Now it's almost a ghost town with many booths and tables emptied.   The service was just okay and the server didn't seem too happy to be there...a far cry from the way it was.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-northridge?start=160,2.64,2.64,2.64,2.18,2.64

Not to mention it was like a Tuesday night so it was super slow. I ordered a steak cooked medium and when it got to the table it was practically still mooing. I asked if I could have a steak that was cooked a little more. The waiter said sure and went into the kitchen. I was assuming that he went to get me a new one. NO. He got me a plate to put my rare steak on so they could take it back and cook it again! Then when it was brought back 20 minutes later it was the same piece of rare meat! Never going back!

109,Lauren P.,"Pasadena, CA",173,737,663.0,3.0,2012-11-09,"Out of the typical American Restaurants (Applebee's, TGI Friday's ect. ect.) Chili's is probably my favorite :) I went here for Happy Hour and it was amazing. I think since this location is right by CSUN they expect broke college students to stumble by after class, which we did. We ended up seeing a ton of familiar faces which wasn't bad, I actually enjoyed it because it made the environment that much more friendly. Our services wasn't fantastic but I get it its a Wednesday night and you have all these rowdy students coming down last minute for Happy Hour . . . it can be frustrating, but if you want tips you're going to have to work for it! We sat at the bar area and our server was very informative and willing to answer our questions the only problem we had was tracking her down when we wanted to order more.  Late Happy Hour Monday-Thursday from 9-Close Margaritas were $4.50-$5.00 depending on if you wanted classic or premium Beers ranged from $3.00-$5.00 (drafts, imports, tap) There were two sections for appetizers  $2.99 / $4.99 What we ordered . . .  Whole order of boneless wings for $4.99 and it got the job done :) Half order of sweet potato fries with parm for $2.99 which also got the job done :) I like Chili's better than the other American Restaurants because the atmosphere is different . . . more lively (especially at this location, probably because of all the students). I hope that makes sense. Overall, I am a fan and I will be back especially for their happy hour!  Note Please note that I am not praising their food. It's good, it's alright, but nothing to die for . . . like I said it gets the job done  Also note that food took forever and it was only fried food!

246,Joey O.,"Los Angeles, CA",22,5,9.0,3.0,2012-11-14,"This is probably one of the worst Chili's restaurants I've ever been to, as it always has the problem of service, food, and people. The service here is not very good, as the waiters are always buzzing all over the place and it takes them twice as long, if not three times as long to get back to you with a refill or some sauce that they forgot to bring out. The food here is far from perfect. Stay far, far away from any steaks here they are not worth anything. Seriously, my Samsung Galaxy SIII was bigger than their steaks and they are always overcooked, as in if you order medium rare you get more of a medium well, and the first thing you taste are the seasonings that they cake onto the meat. Anything fried there is good though, as are the deserts. Being close to CSUN, it is usually crowded on weeknights with a short wait for a table. I highly recommend the 2 for $20 deal, as you get the most for your money. The upgraded version of it is nice, as you get two margaritas and desert for only $15 more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-northridge?start=240,2.84,2.84,2.84,2.476,2.84

I did end up getting the wing appetizer which was o.k. and on their happy hour menu so I can't complain. Overall, it's a clean location with plenty of seating and good service.

232,Chloé M.,"LAKE VIEW TER, CA",326,372,173.0,2.0,2012-12-06,"The only two reasons my boyfriend and I came here today was : 1) he had a $25 gift card so we were like ""Yeah, sure why not... what the heck!"" 2) time was not on our side so we ordered and picked it up.   We did the 2 for $20, I ordered the margarita grilled chicken with rice and broccoli and he got the bacon ranch quesadilla. I ate about 4 bites of my chicken and I couldn't do it anymore I was really skeptical about how cooked it was. Since we ordered to-go I couldn't just send it back to the cooks but it felt like they treated my chicken as if it was a piece steak, attempting to cook it medium well or something. It had the grilled marks and looked lovely but inside looked like it needed an extra 10 to be thoroughly cooked and to where I wouldn't fear being terribly sick after wards. The rice and veggies were about par as well.  My boyfriend's quesadilla had chicken in it and he too wasn't very keen about the chicken. He also felt they should have made it a BBQ chicken, Bacon ranch quesadilla; he felt it would gave it more flavor.  We both agreed that if you're going to put chicken or any type of meat in a quesadilla then you should put thin slices or at lease decent size pieces, not chunks.  All I'm going to say is that I'm glad he had the gift card because I would be pretty bummed if we had to come out of pocket for that meal and that is all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-northridge?start=220,2.72,2.72,2.72,2.216,2.72

Cons: The server was too busy to do anything but deliver food. She only checked on us once & didn't even refill our drinks. My understand is a server should check in after your first few bites....that never happened.  They have armed security. (Unsure why a security guard with a gun is standing right at the front door).

225,Melissa A.,"Lake Balboa, Los Angeles, CA",305,97,67.0,3.0,2013-03-05,"How can you go wrong with All Day Happy Hour Sunday? I don't think you can really. First if you register on   you constantly get coupons for a Free Dessert or Appetizer or 50% off Your bill etc. I signed up way back when I was a student at CSUN for a promotion they were having and for some reason this year my email has been flooded with promotions.  I use to go to Chili's more often when I was at CSUN because they have amazing Specialty Drinks, this was the first time in a while that I had been to this location. The set up for the most part is like any other Chili's, they have the bar sectioned off in the middle of the restaurant with two party booths, bar seating, high top and low top tables. The rest of the restaurant consist of table and booth seating. They commercial campaigns running for $20 dinner for 2 and seem to maintain that promotions, their menus have changes since the last time I was at Chili's and they now have pizzas. The Service there is nothing too special, the waiters seem to do the bare minimum.  Again, we went there for All Day Happy Hour on Sunday, it was a party of 4 and honestly, for everything that we ordered I would say they are VERY inexpensive. I for the Tropical Sunrise Margarita (ITS SO DELICIOUS) this is my go-to drink at Chili's to be honest.  I only had one and I can't really compare non happy hour pricing to happy hour pricing but I only paid $5.95 for it on Sunday. I'm a creature of habit and a VERY picky eater, my friend and fellow Yelper split a Trio Sampler and got Sliders, Southwest Eggrolls and Spinach Artichoke dip, I want to say their portions got smaller from when I remember, this could be because they have new dishware. The sliders were yummy nothing fantastic, Eggrolls were awesome (another signature dish) and the Spinach Artichoke dip was not all that hot. Personally I feel Chili's has the best tortilla chips! They are soft, flaky, warm and fresh. One of the cons to their amazingly flaky chips is that they break very easily, not ideal if you're a scooper like me!  Not to sound like total fatties but we ordered: A Que Queso Skillet, Fried Shrimp entre, a burger entre (and I'm not sure which specific one my boyfriend ordered), the Trio Sampler, Sweet Potato Fries, Full Boneless Buffalo Wings, Two tall Stella Beers, Two Skinny Margaritas, a Tropical Sunrise Margarita and the bill totaled $78 and  change after taxes and everything.

Chili's has a variety. Drinks or no drinks? You choose.  With this particular Chili's, it used to be busy all the time but a variety of other foodie-esque restaurants have opened up in the area, I think that's why it was empty when my friends and I came here. It seemed to be getting busier though towards nighttime, which just confirms my statement of ""one of those places that you go to when you have no idea where to go"".  The food is okay, it's nothing special honestly. I haven't had all of their drinks so I can't judge those but my gin and tonic was made pretty strong, standard and boring. I don't think they play music but I'm not sure. Meh, it's just a boring restaurant to go to as a last resort if you want the restaurant experience but are on a budget, I suppose.  I sound condescending writing this. I understand that. But my love of truffle fries and good craft beer has spoiled me.  The one thing they have that I love: The Chocolate Chip Paradise Pie. It's a brownie with a layer of coconut (I think) and loaded with ice cream and chocolate drizzle with this amazing sauce and it's served in a hot skillet. When my dad used to take me to Chili's when I was a child, it's the one thing I wanted to order, I didn't care about dinner, just dessert. If I tasted it now, I'd probably still be pleased.

Even after the bar got busy, (which was where we sat) his attentiveness was seamless.  When we sat down, I shared with him that I had a coupon for the million flatbread giveaway and would have loved to try it, but I was sure the coupon expired. He went to talk to the manager and he gave us a half order to try---thank you! We ordered and the place filled up completely---he never skipped a beat! He kept our water glasses filled, brought our food and drinks and  everyone around us seemed to be served at a perfect pace---all with a smile, a laugh and an amazing energy!

The soup is delicious and the perfect consistency. I visited another chili's in encino and the portions were smaller and they monterey chicken did not taste as good. I was dissapointed with that location.  My son had the chicken strips and fries and he really liked them.

In the past I have only been to chili's at the West Hills Fallbrook Center or my personal favorite the one in Encino. So today after a trying day at the gym me and my boyfriend see a chili's and decided to stop there for lunch, I mean we LOVE chili's. But from the moment i walked in the service and treatment we got were just not up to par.  To start the hostess took such a long time to seats, even though it really wasn't crowded. and so we waited. Finally when we are seated we met our waiter, and i kid you not I did not see her again until we FINALLY got the check. Instead we found out that what ever we needed was always another waiters problem. It was so disorganized. Another rude and unfriendly waiter with bleached bottom highlights came and try to serve us strawberry lemonade all though we only asked for water was so rude and I swear she gave us a bit of a sneer when we corrected her, she didn't even apologize. In the end we had to wait soooo long just to get out water served and even though they were empty halfway through the appetizers we were never were offered any refills.  The actual meal in itself was still Chili's good, which is why I have to still give to stars. But they messed up my favorite part......DESSERT! I am in love with the Chocolate Chip Cookie skillet, I would take it any day over a Pazookie from BJ's! And they messed mine up and served me mine partially burned it was all dry and crunch not soft and moist. it even look quite unappealing. The third Waiter who served it didn't even ask if my meal was okay when it was obviously not.  I just settled because it wasn't even worth the trouble of finding our waiters and which one would take responsibility to help us. The worst part was how hard it was to get a check, me and my boyfriend wanted to split is 70/30ish so we asked for 20$ to be charged by a card and the rest on a separate check to be paid by cash. Our waiter the one who was MIA the whole service did have of this and made us wait an addition 10 minutes to take my cash. Then even after i asked for some of it to be in singles for tip, when i should be getting 11.88$  back I instead after waiting an addition 5 minutes get: a 10$ and a 1$ bill honestly at this point I thought to my self if you can even give me my correct change to tip you, you obviously don't deserve tip. d  I left that 1$ bill and left and learned next time I'm craving Chili's the drive to Encino is worth having to deal with the terrible service here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-northridge?start=100,2.76,2.75,2.75,2.6000000000000005,2.7539999999999996

They have beer and drink specials, with $4-$5 Large beers and $3-4.50 small beers for Domestic, Premium, and Super Premium though I don't quite get the designation.  Margaritas range from $4.50-$6, and $3.75 mixed drinks and house wine. As for the food menu: $3--sweet potato fries, Texas cheese fries (half order), skillet queso, boneless buffalo wings (half order) $5--Jumbo soft pretzels, Burger bites (2) w/fries, Nachos w/ chicken or beef, Southwestern egg rolls, Boneless Buffalo Wings (full order) We shared sweet potato fries, buffalo wings (half order), and the SW egg rolls The Egg rolls came with  6 pieces and was surprisingly large. I would go back for these as they were a pretty tasty and at $5? Yeah.  The fries and wings (5) were pretty much what I expected, with the buffalo sauce having a nice zing to it.  At happy hr prices it's a very good deal.  The beer selection isn't bad, and you'll probably find something on tap you like if you like beer. Service was fine, even though the bar was busy the bartender was still attentive. Free parking in the private lot in back. Definitely worth a trip or 2. Or three.

I knew of the place but just never really had the urge or craving to just go in and try it out. It's very similar to Applebee's to me, which I've only been to once and was not too impressed.  The best way for me to describe this place..it's not that bad.. I don't think it would be at the top of my list of places I would consider if I was trying to figure out a place to eat. Maybe if it was in the area and there was nothing else that sounded good.. after those circumstances, then maybe.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is bright and upbeat, nothing too different from any other diner such as Denny's, TGI Fridays, and Applebee's. However the hostess and servers made the place feel more welcoming as soon as we walked through the door, which I greatly appreciated. The main reasons I had to give this place only 3 stars is one, originality, and two, simply the taste of the food. I ordered a couple appetizers and for my entree the half rack of ribs. The appetizers were pretty good, but the ribs barely had any meat on the bones which was kind of a let down, especially since I believe the ribs are one of the things the franchise is mostly known for, at least that was the impression I got from all their commercials.. Nothing personal to the location I visited, you guys as a team were awesome, my review is directed more towards the franchise itself. Perhaps it just was not my cup of tea, but I can still see why people would still like eating here.. their prices are reasonable and the variety of their menu selection is solid.. There just was not a ""Wow"" factor to set this place apart from other diners/restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-northridge?start=140,3.04,2.76,2.76,2.636,2.8720000000000003

Tried to order to award winning burgers with their special pickles they've been advertising and they're sold out of both which is a little disappointing when it's advertised like they have more then enough. Anyways finally got my order (which was so bland- I'm assuming the pickles are necessary to give this burger the flavor they promote) and I ordered a side of onion rings and got fries instead and when I told the waitress she blamed the mistake on me. But really the worst thing for me was the ladies rest room. That's what put it over the top for me. The ceiling and stalls were full of spiderwebs (not the decorative kind) and I literally killed a spider in my stall. I know spiders can get in anywhere but from the amount of webs in that bathroom it clearly hadn't been clean in some lengthy amount of time.

The service is good,  the food is pretty decent and it's not a bad price.  We came here on a Saturday night for dinner and it wasn't too crowded even though this Chili's does get very crowded because it's near the CSUN, the nearby university. We noticed there's was a deal on the menu where for $35 you get an appetizer, two different entrées, two margaritas, and a choice of dessert. The only thing is you have to pick off their approved appetizers and entrées, which was a little limited.   I think the $35 deal was pretty great but only one thing was disappointing. We wanted the tableside guacamole and you cannot get this with the $35 deal. There is a deal for chips and guacamole but it's not the tableside one and includes onions and I am allergic to onions so I had to order guacamole separately which kind of sucked. So that was an extra $7.  However our waiter Mike was very nice and patient. We had some kids with us that were making quite a mess and he didn't seem to mind at all.  As for the food, we ordered the table side guacamole, which was good. The chicken fajitas which were decent, and the chicken crispers which were delicious!  We finished it off with a cookie skillet for dessert which was decent.

About an hour and 15 mins after waiting for our food (two burgers, a salad and a cup of soup) a different server came out with our food. When we asked why it took so long, he had no response and said he would grab a manager for us, we also asked him for a refill and a side of ranch. After waiting for another 20 mins our server finally came back to check on us and we explained to him that we were waiting for items that we asked for 20 mins, he quickly went and got them for us (items that we no longer needed becuase we were done with our meals). No manager ever came to the table.

Right as we walked in, the hostess said it would be a 10 minute wait even though there were lots of empty tables (it was not a busy time of day) and then pulled out her phone to text or browse internet. After 10 minutes I went to the bar to ask for water. The hostess finally sat us at a dirty booth (surrounded by other dirty tables) and my wife had to ask her to please wipe off food remnants from the seat. There was also trash on the floor that the hostess conveniently ignored. We sat there for 15 minutes and, even though a waiter and waitress walked passed us several times, no one took our order. They didn't even bother to acknowledge us. Meanwhile, four parties that arrived after us were immediately seated in a clean area of the restaurant. Not only were they promptly seated, but no less than three servers immediately took their orders. They had water and drinks served in less than 5 minutes. My wife and I sat astounded as this all transpired. After it became quite obvious that we were seated at a closed section of the restaurant, my wife asked to speak to the manager on duty. He said he had just arrived to start his shift. His attitude was one of, ""What do you want me to do about it, I just got here."" When my wife said we just wanted to explain what was going on, he didn't seem to care. My wife then said she would contact the corporate offices and he pretty much said, ""Go ahead, I don't care."" We said, ""That's no way to treat your customers"" and left. After I contacted the Chili's customer service department via email I realized why the manager had a nonchalant attitude. They could care less either! They said they would direct my concerns to the management at the restaurant, which made no sense at all since they were the ones I was complaining about.

Even the trainees seem to be getting the needed attention to do a nice job.   I am starting with the service because you may ultimately have an issue with kitchen consistency. I am not using this one meal to determine my overall dining experience with Chili's but I think it's indicative of the aforementioned kitchen delivering the goods. Chili's has morphed their menu over the years from being a mostly burger and fries with a few salads to one with a much more diversified selection.  Take a look at this plating, both the rice and beans look like a school cafeteria or mess hall cook slapped it on there.  The  ""soft""  tacos's themselves were served in a flour tortilla that succumbed to the juices of the various fillings. Carnitas, Fish and Chicken-one of each and sadly none were a real standout.  The wrong ingredients to place in that raw flour tortilla.  Three soft taco combo I have had many other menu items at Chili's before that were far better prepared and plated that the three taco combo. What makes this dish difficult to pull off for Chilli's is the monumental number of quality Mexican and even Gringo places in the neighboring area serving far better takes on this plate. Translation I won't order this again but it won't keep me from coming back to this Chili's.  Their menu has come a long way but their execution and value for some of the dishes leaves something to be desired. Hopefully they start fine tuning what is working and what isn't and improve from there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-northridge?start=40,2.68,2.84,2.84,2.476,2.7760000000000002

84,Andy L.,"Pacoima, CA",283,220,6.0,3.0,2015-08-17,"Went here after a hike with two cousins on a Saturday evening. It was a random decision but no complaints here. Food:  Trying to keep the healthy vibe going we went with the Sante Fe salad, Quesadilla Explosion salad, and the steak quesadilla. All were pretty good, wish the salad had more salad and regret not getting the dressing on the side. The Sante Fe salad was better, it has avocados and the dressing has a kick to it. The quesadilla explosion salad was a little too cheesy but it did come with some quesadilla on the side which was a plus. The steak quesadilla was good too, plenty of steak in every bite, it also came with bacon but that might have been the only time where bacon didn't help. Overall it was pretty good meal, will remember to get the dressing on the side next time, just wish the salad servings were a little bigger.  Service: Pretty good service, server was back and forth between his tables quickly. Drinks were kept filled the entire time. Tables setup seems a little messy if they are crowded, not a lot of room in between. The pay by machine at every table is a fantastic idea. Usually always have a bad time trying to flag down a waiter for the bill.  Location: Right behind the China Olive Buffet. Shared parking but was still easy to find a space even on the weekend. Keep in mind though they have a guard that will tow your car if you park there and go to a different plaza nearby.

67,Angeline A.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",613,23,30.0,2.0,2015-09-21,"The only reason this Chili's is getting two stars is because of the company I was with. Other then that, what a horrible experience. Yesterday when we walked in we weren't greeted. The front host stand was empty, and we were just standing there looking around seeing a ton of tables open.  We ordered drinks, all of us ordered water, except my friend who ordered a Lemonade...When the server came back after a while, he brought our waters and told us that ""they were out of anything lemonade based"". Ok, great, but he left without even asking if he wanted something else instead.  We ordered the cheese fries as our appetizers, and they were pretty good.  When it was time to order our actual meal the server asked us what we wanted, everyone ordered and when I ordered the Boneless Buffalo Wings, he said ""I think we are out""...and I asked ""You think? or you know?"" & he couldn't answer... so I said ""can you find out for me please""... I felt like I was pulling teeth for information.  He came back to confirm that they were out of what I wanted and I ordered the Big Mouth Bites with fries. My friends ordered the mango talapia, a burger, and my boyfriend & I had the big mouth bites. When the runner served our food, she dropped my fries in my water -_- and laughed about it... c'mon! She didn't offer to get me a new batch, she just laughed and tried to make a joke about it. If i'm going to pay to dine out, I kind of don't want my food to be dropped into water. I didn't want to ask because, well, I felt like she should have spoken to her manager and offer something.. Everyone including myself said their food was alright, nothing special.  I used to love Chili's, but it's become a little bit over-rated.  After dinner, I ordered the Molten Lava Cake, and our server again laughed and said ""I'm sorry but we are out of that now"" and I said that I had just seen one come out 2 min ago. He said that on sunday nights they normally run out of half of the menu and not to come back during this time... Anyways I ordered the Oreo Molten Lava Cake, and OK i have to say that was DELICIOUS.  It was a terrible experience & hopefully we will go back and have a better one. We will try the one in Encino.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-northridge?start=40,2.84,2.88,2.88,2.408,2.864

Because I really enjoy a few items on the menu and have gone to this particular chilis multiple times. I thought it'd be a good place to go. I made the reservation a week before going because it was a large party of 20-25 people and they said no problem. Our reservation was for 8:30 they did not seat us until 9:30. One of our two servers took the drink order along with a few appetizers. The appetizers came out before 2/3 of our drinks and that was about 30 minutes after we had taken the drink order. Because it was taking so long a few of my guests left. Then as they started taking our dinner order I was so upset because our waitress completely forgot to take my and my friend's order. I got up and told her we did not order yet so she came back and took it. I sat there unattended for a while with no ask for a refill on my drink and that was it for me. I went to the manager almost in tears because of how upset I was about the terrible/lack of service and he was apologetic and said he would talk to the waitresses. They came back and were much better but the manager never checked back up to make sure things were going smoothly.

First off we are told the wait time will be 10-15 min and are seated 30 min after giving our name. After we are seated we ordered drinks and those didn't arrive at our table for about another 10 min. We ordered our food at the same time we ordered drinks and once the drinks finally came we were told that the food should be coming right up. We waited another 20 min for our food and nothing. My bf ordered another beer and when that made it to our table we are already pretty annoyed so we mentioned that we were told our food would be right out and it's already been another 20 min. She just replied ""ok"" with a scared look on her face and rushed away. A while later the manager showed up, apologized for the long wait, and offered a free dessert. We agreed that was a nice gesture except we never get dessert so we weren't interested whatsoever. Our food finally came out after waiting for about 45 min total after being seated, we were starving at this point so we ate it pretty quickly. I had to ask for extra avocado like ALWAYS because they are parsimonious when it comes to avocados and the avocado you actually get on your plate never looks anything like the pictures on the menu. Anyway so my boyfriend ordered the salmon and was pretty much finished eating it when he realized it tasted different. He took a closer look and realized it wasn't fully cooked! He asked the waitress if that looked cooked to her and she agreed it wasn't cooked properly. The manager was talked to AGAIN and he simply comped $9 for the fish. Uh really?

I do not eat meat, i am a pescatarian meaning i eat seafood as my only meat. That being said, they really do not offer many options for people like me or vegetarians either. They have salmon shrimp and tilapia. If i am going to have salmon and a side i would rather have that in a more upscale place not here. Tilapia lives in and eats shit so it tastes horrible anyways, and shrimp fajitas can get pretty boring id rather have them at Acapulco down the street. They do not have any vegetarian options and if you try to substitute anything they don't let you even for an additional charge. Im left starving basically or having to settle for something i don't really want. When adding new items to their menu Chili's really needs to modernize themselves and add more options for seafood eaters and vegetarians. ESPECIALLY VEGETARIANS. There are so many people now a days who do not eat meat and honestly it is so disappointing seeing these new items on the menu like skillets and wraps and stuff but no new vegetarian or seafood options. either add more options for vegetarians or make it easier for us to substitute things and create ourselves our own happy version of one of your meals.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-northridge?start=140,2.76,2.79,2.79,2.7280000000000006,2.7779999999999996

The salad could be fresher, it was pretty old and wilted.  Fries seemed like they had been sitting out for a while.  Ribs weren't that bad but they lacked the smoky taste.  I actually liked their Dr. Pepper bbq sauce but wished there was more of it.  The ""molten chocolate"" wasn't molten and had pretty much solidified, but the cake itself was good.

Each time a manager even came out to apologize and comp the dish (not the meal) and bring out a new one. I thought that it's about as best as they can do. Can't turn back time. Can't make things un-happen. That's all they can do really. I won't knock them for that but a big part of me does not want to step foot in this particular location again.

When he brings our drinks out he DROPS them on the table and even managed to get mine wrong.  I'm not a complaint person so when he asks me which I prefer I go ""no problem dude"" he responds ""good because I don't feel like getting what you ordered anyways"" - that's fine I'll let it go.  Then homeboy disappears for half an hour. We tried flagging him down at least 5 times and he just stormed passed us. Finally when he decides to take our order 45 minutes after we arrive he goes ""thanks so much for being so liberal with your time.""... Really?

Anyway, I got the dinner meal where you get appetizers, and 2 dinner entrees for $24. Appetizer was chips with guac & salsa. Dinner was a burger and pasta.

I went up to host with bad attitude and told him I was there... he said ""okay, there are still 5 parties ahead of you"" I told him no problem. I check the app 45 minutes later and it said there was one party ahead of me. I told my sister we should be next and 6 parties later, I go up to a different female hostess and she told me the guy host never checked me in! I was soooo angry. The female hostess immediately apologized, the guy didn't even care. The girl sat us down and our waitress was in training with an experienced waiter training her. We were already irritated and just quickly ordered our food since we had looked at the menu for the last hour by the time we sat down. We ordered drinks, 20 minutes later I asked if drinks were coming soon and the waiter said the bartender made the wrong drinks, so he made him redo the drinks and the waiter never got them so they melted  (blended margaritas)!!! Finally after about 35-40 minutes we finally got our drinks. We were soooo angry we really considered just walking out, not even wait for food. When we were going to leave the food finally arrived after 2 hours of already being there we finally had food in front of us. The food was good but the overall experience just wasn't worth it. The drinks should have at least been complimentary after all the bs we had gone through already but nope, we still had a nice long check at the end of the dinner.

I ended up leaving a half plate of fajitas since I just got so frustrated with their service. This is not worth coming to , I expect to be treated better than this since I'm the one paying for their services and their food they advertise all over television . Only reason I came because it played a commercial on television and on an empty stomach it hit me... Sadly I won't be coming to this chili's location or any other one in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-northridge,2.52,2.75,2.776,,2.6580000000000004
4,Anet Y.,"Granada Hills, CA",40,52,89.0,5.0,2017-12-12,This is my favorite spot in the valley. There is usually a 30 minute wait on the weekends but it is worth the wait. They have great food and drinks. They have great deals for dinner. You can get appetizer and entrees for 2 only for 22 dollars or add drinks and dessert for 35 dollars. The service is always good and food is decent.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-northridge,2.52,2.76,2.78,,2.664
0,Jess M.,"Rosemead, CA",7,26,27.0,4.0,2017-12-13,"This is one of our favorite workday lunch spots and happy hours for around four years now! The manager, Alex, is the main reason we keep coming back. He knows how to take care of customers, he trains his staff well on customer service. The current wait staff & bartenders are good! (There have been a few bad ones in the past.) There's a nice, chill vibe in the restaurant so it always feels good hanging out there. Great place for a group party or a big family meal together! Never once have I or my coworkers had any complaints about the food. I like the smokehouse combo with ribs, sausage, fries and elote, the steak plate, sliders, tortilla soup, and many of the other appetizers. I mean, it's a chain restaurant, so it's not the best steak in my life, but it's always cooked right and delicious. I'd have to say that the best thing is that the food is consistent-- I can count on ordering my favorites and they'll come out as good as last time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-northridge,2.48,2.77,2.792,,2.654

I mean, who doesn't have wheat buns? So my mom ended up wrwooong her burger in lettuce and it was not so good.  I had the chicken enchilada soup which is my go to choice and a house salad which you can't go wrong.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-northridge,2.48,2.79,2.788,,2.6660000000000004
