39,Melissa T.,"Ocala, FL",0,2,,1.0,2012-12-07,"Terrible service - you wait about 5-10 minutes for a server to stop by, then you wait 5-10 minutes for drinks - non alcoholic. If you order alcohol you're waiting longer. Everyone else gets their NA bevs and you're still waiting. Not even a water.  You'd better order right away - otherwise the server won't come back for 10 minutes for your order. So far, 20 minutes minimum and you have drinks but are yet to place your order.  Then the staff usually messes it up when it does come out - usually 20-30 minutes after you order. Then you wait 10 minutes for them to fix it or bring what is missing.  So far I've written this review waiting in the booth for the server to come back for the dessert order we said we would be making in just a couple minutes. It's been 10.  Total incompetence - I'm blaming management - I've only seen a manager once and they were screwing around near the bar. Can't blame an employee that hasn't been trained.  We still come back so I guess my frustration is my own fault - but the food is usually pretty tasty and the molten cake is the best hands down - when it comes out right.  Servers seem busy and overwhelmed constantly - but have 3-4 tables. Ridiculous.  Only 2 servers we have had are any good - competent and quick.  So far - been here over an hour and still waiting on dessert. If you come here you'd better not be in a hurry to be anywhere afterward. Sooooo slow. Its a good thing they have Happy Hour - this place drives you to drink.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ocala?start=20,1.4120000000000001,1.4120000000000001,1.4120000000000001,1.4120000000000001,1.4120000000000001

31,Jessica M.,"New Bedford, MA",45,10,3.0,1.0,2014-09-04,"I went to this location about a month ago, wrote a review, and lost it. My experience has haunted me so much though, that I still feel the need to write a review. So here goes:  First off, I don't expect much from chain restaurants, and the night I went I was expecting mediocre food, service, and atmosphere. My expectations were far too high. When we walked into the place, we were greeted by our hostess and the wafting odor of mildew and grease. All of the televisions had been taken off the wall, and the place looked like it was going out of business. The stench in the restaurant cost us our appetite and instead of ordering meals, we just ordered the Texas cheese fries (my FAVORITE Chili's menu item). When it was brought out to us, the plate was covered in cheese and not ONE fry could be seen. We started poking through the cheese and were able to salvage a few poor, suffocating spuds. I never in my life thought I would complain about cheese, but that plate was inedible. Before we left, I stopped in the restroom, and on my way passed by the kitchen. It was clear at this point where at least part of the smell in the restaurant was coming from for there was food literally floor to ceiling in the kitchen. Everything was covered in grease and food, and it looked like it hadn't been cleaned in WEEKS. Ugh. Needless to say, we both felt ill on our long ride home.  NEVER AGAIN. STEER CLEAR.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ocala?start=20,1.4120000000000001,1.4120000000000001,1.4120000000000001,1.4120000000000001,1.4120000000000001
28,Kurtis P.,"Matawan, NJ",56,435,2.0,3.0,2014-09-10,"It's a chain restaurant, so much of the decor, atmosphere, layout, menu etc.. is pretty standard across the board. This is one of the older locations so it still has hints of the old-style Chili's (in-fact this was the first one I went to about 2 decades ago and it still feels that way). We stopped in for a late lunch so the place was pretty empty. We sat in the bar area and were served right away. The waitress kept coming around to check on us so the service was pretty good. The only real drawback was that the place definitely felt out-dated and was trying to be updated, but not going all the way.

29,Natasha D.,"St. Petersburg, FL",202,116,367.0,5.0,2014-09-19,"I love me some Chili's! I was so excited to see this one off the interstate in Ocala. Was greeted at the door for lunch by a very pleasant young man. I told him I was going to sit at the bar and he said that ""Sherri would be right out!"" Yay. Another friendly server said the same as I was sitting down. Sherri is awesome! She's super friendly and works very fast and efficiently. I ordered my drinks and food together as I usually do because I'm always afraid the server will run away and not come back for a while. Not Sherri, she was prompt and continued to check on me the entire time. The entire waitstaff was smiling. The management here must be great. The staff is SO friendly. I ordered the mango chili chicken with double broccoli and no rice from the lighter choices menu. As well as a vodka and soda (it was Friday!). Chili's does 2-4-1 happy all day, another great reason I love this place. Sitting at the bar, you can hear everything that goes on in the kitchen. Apparently they time the food. I overheard a few dishes ""going on 17 minutes"". But I also heard ""I need a runner to table (insert number here) please!"" Very efficient and systematic operation here, as well as respectful. I've actually never heard the word ""please"" so many times in the limited amount of time I was there. I could see Sherri getting a little stressed as the to go ordered started to pile in, but she was always calm and collected. As a former server, this isn't easy to do. Situations like being in the weeds can cause meltdowns. The staff was very quick and on their toes here though. My food came out in about 20 minutes. The chicken was a little over cooked but the flavor was great! The broccoli was steamed and fell apart as my fork touched it, perfect. All in all a good meal. It continued to pick up and this place got REALLY busy. I can see why they are so popular. It does feel a little frazzled here though. It's hectic at lunch, the phone doesn't stop ringing and there are a lot of people picking up to go orders. I saw the manager personally apologize to those waiting on to go orders. A lot of them wanted to split checks, which is super annoying as a server, but Sherri was great about it. She's a great multi tasker! I'll be back here as I travel through often. It's exactly how a lunch crowd should be managed. Great staff!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ocala?start=20,1.7800000000000002,1.7800000000000002,1.7800000000000002,1.7800000000000002,1.7800000000000005

Yum.  Some of the chips were overdressed like the oil was just under where it should be in heat.  I love their thin chips though. My grandfather ordered a corn on the cob and a salad, both of which he said were good.   I had a salad for an appetizer and then shared the fajitas with my mom.  The salad was good except that I found a couple of foreign objects in it.. 1 bean, and 1 i-have-no-idea-blackened-fried-smthn.. The fajitas were delicious, hard to mess those up. At time to pay the bill, the waitress came over to show us how to do the payment on the computer screen.  She must have thought we were idiots.. because when the transaction was complete, it asks you to do a quick rating/survey.. and she quickly snatched the machine from my mom's hands and stood there filling it out herself.  So rude..

5,Anne G.,"Ocala, FL",0,3,1.0,1.0,2016-10-13,"Upon arrival at Chili's we were greeted by a hostess who has clearly seen better days. She did not offer a greeting, instead she dry said ""two"" grabed menus and started walking. The restaurant was empty yet we were taken to a crowded corner and seated at a small table sandwiched in the corner. A few minutes later our waiter, Ryan, arrived and asked for drink orders. This was quick, and painless as we knew what we wanted to drink. That was the end of quick and painless for the duration of the night. It took seven minutes for the water to be dropped on the corner of the table with a ""here"". The vodka and tonic that was ordered took another five minutes after the water to be delivered. Mind you there were less than 10 people in the whole place. We decided that we simply wanted appetizers as we had other plans for the night, and we figured it couldn't take that long for appetizers.  We couldn't have been more wrong. The food did not come to the table until 10:56p, which was about 4 minutes before the restaurant was supposed to close. The chicken crispers, which were part of the appetizers tasted like old oil that had previously had cheap store brand fish sticks fried in it. Similarly, the southwest egg rolls tasted like they had just come out from under a heat light where they'd been sitting for most of the night.  By this point the waiter was hovering in hopes of rushing us along, and even asked at one point if we needed boxes.  When asked for sauce to go he came back with empty sace cups so we could take what was left of our sauce. His excuse for this was that the sauce was put up and he ""couldn't get us any if he wanted to"".  After paying, we left a cash tip on the table, but he came back acting shocked to see that there was no tip on the credit card. The fact of the matter is that the food and service did not justify a tip and he is lucky anything was left. In the end, Chili's has gone downhill and is no longer worth the money nor the wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ocala,,,,,

Food comes out cold or not cooked all the way through. We sent our food back and the manager didn't even come out to apologize.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ocala,1.6,1.6,1.6,,1.6000000000000003

2,Kristen E.,"Cape Coral, FL",16,14,18.0,1.0,2017-09-07,"Okay, I like Chilis, we eat at our local one on a fairly regular basis.  Some visits the service is a little dicey but the food is normally exactly what you want.  So, when I saw the other negative reviews I just shrugged my shoulders, bad service does happen.  And we did have pretty mediocre service.  But we were a large party of 6 adults and 4 kids, I know, we're no picnic to deal with.  The service was slow, the refills were slow, the waitress was rarely seen.  There was MOLD on the bun of my sister's chicken sandwich.   Mold.  Seriously, how can a place that sells so many burgers even have buns around long enough to get mold?!   Because we were so rarely visited by our waitress, my BIL eventually took my sister's plate up to the Hostess station to get someone to address the problem.   The manager did come and apologize.  And a good portion of our bill was comped.  But seriously, there is Ruby Tuesdays one block further, go there instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ocala,1.44,1.44,1.44,,1.44
13,Ce M.,"Winter Park, FL",0,7,4.0,1.0,2017-09-29,The 1.5 star rating is generous. Unfortunately I didn't look at yelp prior to coming in. Got a simple salad with shrimp...they were raw. Sent it back. The second try was okay. The bar tender is nice but the place is generally unclean. Won't be back without significant indication of change. This is truly a manager issue. I'd start with a new one if I owned it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ocala,1.44,1.44,1.44,,1.44
6,Barry K.,"Saint Johns, FL",0,63,14.0,1.0,2017-10-06,DO EAT HERE. One of the worst Chili's I've ever been to. Floor is disgusting. Floor in the kitchen is even worse. Tiny portions. Burger was over cooked and they served tiny bay shrimp with the shrimp fajitas. Serves was pleasant but barely available. Zero chance we'll be back on our next trip through.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ocala,1.4,1.4,1.4,,1.4

1,Yvette J.,"Lebanon, OH",0,14,24.0,1.0,2017-11-25,"Wish I could write a review without giving it a star, this place is a ZERO!  Don't waste your time, money or sanity! Service is a joke! Management (Stephen) the worst I've encountered.   Corporate wake up and do something! Save your chain name and retrain this location or SHUT it DOWN!  We were not apologized too for having to move tables due to a large loud obnoxious group ( 2 other tables requested to also move), manager not helpful, then food was thrown down at us, no one checked on us after food delivered, couldn't get refills on our drinks or chips then I literally had to run down the manager to pay my bill what a joke!   This restaurant is DIRTY as soon as I saw the back kitchen when using the restroom which was also horribly dirty I should've left, (wish I would've taken photos) dumb dumb me!  I will be calling corporate!  Stay away!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-ocala,1.4,1.4,1.4,,1.4
