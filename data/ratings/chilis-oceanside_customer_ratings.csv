125,Joshua F.,"Oceanside, CA",117,8,,5.0,2012-07-07,"Hello again Yelp, Yes yet again another 5 Star review from me. My wife and I usually tend to stay away from these large chain restaurants when going out for a drink. Just like everyone else we like small hole in the wall places where everybody knows your name. Our First Visit:    We visited Chili's on a whim, because we hadn't tried it before so we stopped in for a bite to eat. Being the person I am I informed my wife the bar was the place to be, even though we planned on eating as well, so we had a seat. As we were walking up to the bar we were greeted with kindness by both of the bartenders. They asked for our names and introduced themselves as well, making us feel very welcome. While we settled in and exchanged small talk they also managed to let us know the current featured drinks and happy hour specials, informatively though not pushing them upon us. My wife tried one of their Margaritas with a Corona in it and loved it, I personally had a Fat Tire on tap, which always hits the spot. The food was great as well, it isn't the most amazing food in the world, this is not a gourmet restaurant but it is more than pleasing for a chain. I had the honey chipolte  chicken crispers which were delicious and I get them quite a bit there. My wife enjoyed a Casear salad, minus the chicken. She now often gets a side of broccoli as well.  Later:    We still constantly visit Chili's as our local bar, we enjoy spending time there and meeting new people.  Thank you to all the wonderful bartenders, if you read this you know who you are. You all do an outstanding job making people feel welcome.  That's all for this time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oceanside?start=120,3.52,3.52,3.52,3.124,3.5200000000000005
205,Megan G.,"Murrells Inlet, SC",11,8,1.0,2.0,2012-07-17,"5 adults + one baby going to get some happy hour and have a good family dinner. we go to the bar because they said that was only only place to get HH prices... not one team member came up to us to help accommodate us into fitting into a table or booth (they didn't ask to push tables together or pull up chairs) when the server/bartender came up to see us trying to squeeze into a booth (because that's what we preferred) she was making facial gestures like ""any day now"" when we told her that we wanted to get the HH prices but couldn't have us all fit comfortable she went somewhere to see if that can be accommodated in the restaurant area- she came back and said they would allow it, just tell them DARBY said okay (not sure if that was her or a manager) she then escorted us to the hostess stand and told the hostess to tell our new server (Mischa) that DARBY said it was okay. They brought us to a large enough table and we waited about 5 minutes (in my years for f&b, that is considered a long time) she was a sweet girl, but seemed either new, didn't know anything about the menu or very timid. We showed her what drinks we wanted from the HH menu and she explained to us that it was only valid in the bar- WELL last time I checked the hostess was suppose to tell you that DARBY said it was OKAY - so we explained that to her and she said fine, (since no one else thought it was a good idea to let her know) When we asked what the HH prices and drinks that were included she had no idea, and instead of telling us she will quickly check, she stood there telling us she didn't know. That right there is WRONG- my sister-in-law had to get up, and walk to the bar herself to figure out what the HH deal was, as the server stood with us getting a round of waters. my SIL came back and told the SERVER and us what the specials were and the server seemed pretty dumb founded. it took her no less than 10 minutes to bring us a round of waters, 5minutes after that came my rum & coke and a dr pepper. She came back about 5 minutes later to get our dinner order- we all got the 2for 20 with extra appetizers- she didn't ask the appropriate questions (burger temp, or type of sauce on my SIL's ribs). it took over 25minutes to get our apps- I had to flag down a hostess to check on it, then they came out 1minute after. we repeatedly asked her for extra napkins and dipping sauce- when she came back with the ranch I had to ask her again for the napkins.. when we were barely half way through the apps our dinner arrived.. obviously we were extremely upset because we had no time to eat, relax and enjoy our apps because of how late they came out. THE APPS WERE OVER COOKED AND LUKE WARM-the cheese was hard on the fries probably because they were dying in the window. when my sister got her ribs she asked if those were the right sauce, because the girl didn't even ask- so she must of assumed- the server apologized and hesitated a bit to remove the plate from her, luckily the burger was a good temp. sis explained she was upset about the time it took for our apps and the server apologized. The manager came over to tell her he was sorry about the timing and that he will wait for the ribs if she wants to finish her app-  ugh HELLO?! the whole table was pissed about the timing, just because she is the only one who said something for ALL of us doesn't mean we all wanted to have our dinner sitting in our face getting cold bc we were trying to eat our apps - she said no, because the rest of my family has their dinner. he then walked away and the ribs came out. After that the server became more attentive and I did feel bad for her because I know how demanding it can be in that industry, but if you can't handle it or know your stuff you need to train/study more or find a different field. when the check arrive she did not give me the HH pricing for my drinks, so she had to fix that, nor was anything comped for the poor service and timing we received. We were so beyond agitated because we wanted a nice family dinner that we did not feel like complaining anymore. I left her a decent tip because I felt really bad for this timid girl, but we will NEVER return to this Chili's & I really hope they start having pre-shifts or more training available.

For me, Chili's is one of those neutral type of places where you know there will be plenty on the menu to choose from and there will be something decent for everyone. Tonight was no different. Both of us have somewhat special dietary requirements (he's on a serious clean eating/guten free/etc etc kick and I've had bariatric surgery), but we both were able to have our orders easily modified to accomodate us.  As expected for a Friday night, the place was super packed and there was a 25 min wait time. The parking sucked and I had to park quite a distance away from the restaurant. We had the pleasure of being served by an awesome waitress named Alyssa. She was bubbly, playful and patient with our many requests.  I had the grilled chicken salad and my date had the fajita trio.

195,Dick W.,"Encinitas, CA",0,20,3.0,4.0,2013-05-06,"I ate here with my gf last night and the service was a bit slow, the food was just good, but it's something else that made me appreciate this restaurant and it's staff. I had gone to the restroom before the food came and when I came back I took 2 rings off my hand so I could get my hands completely dry after washing them. I must've set the rings on the table and forgotten them once we paid and left because when I woke up this morning I realized they were gone and couldn't find them anywhere around my house. After work today I decided to stop by Chili's just hoping that someone had found them and put them aside safely in a lost and found. I really didn't think I was going to get them back, figured a busboy had just pocketed them when he found them or something, but to my surprise the hostess at the front desk came out from the back of the restaurant with both my rings in her hand and a smile on her face. I seriously couldn't believe it. Someone could've easily come up on over $300 in nice jewelery but instead whoever it was that found that was honest and turned them into a manager who placed them in the lost and found area. So despite the mediocre food and service, at least their staff has integrity and can be trusted with their patrons personal items. I'm going to chalk up the slow service and room temperature food to a bad night in the kitchen this time and I'll definitely be coming back to give them another shot based on their honesty alone.

The hamburgers were very good but mine was missing the BBQ sauce that was supposed to be on it. Took our server long enough to return with it and my husband was halfway through his meal.

113,Lea O.,"Oceanside, CA",114,33,,1.0,2013-05-20,"I used to give Chili's three stars as the customer service was always good and friendly but the food was basic restaurant fare, nothing extraordinary. But the new tablet at the table and the service that goes along with it completely ruined our experience. Chili's now has two servers per a table. We saw one of our servers twice, didn't see the other one at all, someone else brought our drinks, and another person brought our food. When we were seated the hostess let us know about the new tablets and how they have games on them. She didn't tell us that we had to pay to use the games, if we had just handed this over to our daughter to play with she would have added that on to our bill. Thankfully we didn't, we realized immediately how they worked and put it at the end of the table and didn't play with it. But you're now expected to re-order your drinks and order appetizers and desserts from the new tablet because its apparently too much trouble for your servers to ask.  When our server came to our table she introduced herself and asked us our names. That's fine for my five year old but idiotic for us as adults... It sounded like she was attempting to make the experience more personable but truthfully we saw her twice so it just came off as fake and forced (not that our server wasn't trying). BUT THAT WASN'T HER FAULT. There were way too many hands in our customer service for her to make a connection. I couldn't even remember our server's name... which for me is a big deal, but we didn't see her enough for it to even matter. She gave us her name, asked for ours, and no one used either at any point during the meal. BLEH! When we were finished with our meal and went to pay our check (again on the tablet), it had turned out that the wrong one was on our table and instead of a $30 bill, we had a $90 bill. It took over 10 minutes to get this fixed as the other table had already paid our bill. We were already so put off by our experience that we just wanted to go.  I live off tips, but with the lack of customer service we didn't feel our servers deserved the automatic 20% tip that the tablet forced on us and we did change it to 15% (which sucks because we normally leave a 40-60% tip but I couldn't do it with the crap for service we received). My husband and I normally go here a couple times a month as this Chili's is walking distance from our house and our servers have always been friendly and personable, after this I doubt we'll return. When the servers changed to two servers per a table the quality of service had already decreased but now the level of gimmick and lack of customer service is appalling. I'd rather have to drive somewhere further out than receive poor service for food that is standard restaurant fare.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oceanside?start=140,3.24,3.24,3.24,2.148,3.2400000000000007
55,Lindsey M.,"Vista, CA",205,252,321.0,4.0,2013-05-21,"On average, I find myself eating at this restaurant at least once a month. With summer approaching, I'll probably see me and my family in there 2 or 3 times a month and I'll explain why. Why do I return time and time again? The food's pretty tasty and the prices don't make my wallet ache.With this chain, I'm a creature of habit, I tend to always order the Big Mouth Bites, which I can share with my picky eater of a 2 year old. 4 sliders and a fair heap of fries and fried onion strips -don't forget the cup of ranch! The 2/$20 deal is super (in terms of amount of food and price) if you've got a buddy, honey, or date to go halves with you Shoot, you could just have an extreme appetite, the deal will satiate your hunger and not break the bank . Of course, Chilis being known for it's ribs, you'll want to check out that sweet portion of the menu! So the reason for my increased future visits is that Chili's offers Happy Hour. Sit in the bar during Happy Hour time(s) and enjoy cheap eats ($2.99-4.99) and drinks. The margaritas are delicious, especially the Tropical Sunrise and if you'd like to walk away a little wobbly, try El Niño margarita! During Happy Hour, I believe you'll only get a deal on the Tropical Sunrise and one other margarita, but hey, a drink's a drink and at a lowered price, you can't go wrong. In addition, Chili's-To-Go has never failed my family and they just now added Tablet/iPad menus to their tables which I think is pretty darn innovative. Order your desserts, look through specials, play games (well, for $0.99 a game...), pay your bill, and print your receipt!

Went there on a Friday night trying to do some drinking with my friends who also wanted to eat, but I wasn't hungry. So we're seated quickly and introduced to our server, she was really nice, when I told her I was only drinking, she said sometimes her meals are purely liquid as well.

So that tells me it's the management.   The serving is pretty much garbage. I would give the waitresses 0 stars.  The only reason why I gave this place 2 stars is the food is decent.  But the 2 times I been to this chili's (the second time on accident because it was so long since we went I spaced out how much I hated going to this place) it took 2-3 minutes for anybody to meet us at the door and sit us. (Both times for lunch when it was very very slow) So it takes maybe 6-8 minutes for a less than busy waitress to take our drink order and then I realize again how much I hate this place.  Do they have good drinks, maybe.  Good food, yeah it's decent but the service is garbage.   I would save my time and money and go to Applebees down the street.  I would ALWAYS choose Chili's before Appplebee's but this Chili's is not my favorite place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oceanside?start=160,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.3120000000000003,3.2000000000000006

I ask the hostess that question as she's seating me fifteen minutes later and she informs me I came during a shift change. OK. 5 minutes later my kids and I are stuffing our faces with chips and dip. The dip was some ground beef and cheese blend that was cold, but the fact that I was starving didn't lead me to have them remake it. 15minutes later we have our food. I ordered a chicken breast topped with bacon, cheeses and avocado, southwest Mac n cheese and broccoli. My kids both got hamburger kids meals with veggies on the side.  My daughter, who is 3, needed to GI to the restroom ten minutes into our meal. My son is only 5 so I took him with us to the restroom which is literally three booths away from our booth along with the waitress station. 5 minutes later, we come back to our booth and all the food is cleared away. My daughter is whining for her burger when the waitress comes back by with my daughters mini purse apologizing because she 'thought we left'. How so with over half our food still on the table and no check even submitted or ever even GIVEN to us because we had just gotten our meal!

After having such great experiences with both Service and Food, it seems the new experience has worn off.  Christine is no longer there :( and since she has left we have not found a replacement server that has given us the level of high quality service as her. So much to the point as we only go here as a take out restaurant. What we dislike about the take out side is we are required to pay 79cents now for extra salsa with our chips and salsa... Have you seen the bag of chips they give you and the extremely small salsa container? It's not even a possibility to eat chips and salsa because you run out of salsa 15 chips in. What's even funnier is that if I were to sit down not only do I get unlimited salsa but I also get unlimited chips....  Recently we came in and decided let's sit not in the bar but the dining room. Our waitress was decent. She checked on us and made sure everyone around us was taken care of. The only fault this time was our chicken. Under cooked. They did make it right but by the time it came back out of course mine was practically finished.  Overall this place has moved to being middle of the run and average where average is becoming acceptable.. .... New City and New Chances. After having several disappointments with Chili's in other areas in Orange County & LA County we were reluctant to try another. But with our New City we figured lets give it a chance. When coming into the bar we were able to find seating at a table top. We first noticed the new kiosk tablet at the table. Immediately we started playing with it like little kids we are. Then our server came up to us introduced herself as Christine and was on point all night. She went over the easy to use tablet, which was so easy to reorder our drinks. Later on in the night the Manager Conrad came over pleasantly introduced himself and continued with the great customer service. Although this time around we hadn't ordered entrees only drinks, appetizers and dessert. Everything about this experience was worth coming back for the to try the food.

The service was slow, and the food was average.  Nothing great to report.   The kicker was the ipad like device that was on the table.  Had the menu electronically, had games for the kids, etc...Not a bad touch but felt more like someone placing a flat panel tv in your grandma's house to make the house feel modern.  Just doesn't go. When I got the bill they charged me .99 for use of the tablet my 3 year old was playing with.  It's not the money, it's the principle....nickel and dime me for a value add at the table. I wish this place well, but they are like Hooters....outdated and missing the mark.

The bad: We were basically ignored for 20 minutes until I got the bartender to call a server. Poor girl was working both sides of the restaurant. But that's not my problem. We never got a refill on our chips and salsa and had to flag her down for drinks.  Now the gross: I opened the menu and it was wet. And had chunks of food in it. Figured I would get another one.

My chicken was cold and tasted almost doughy and mushy. My boyfriend, however, really liked his pasta. My server refilled my Dr. Pepper and when she set it down, the cup was soaking wet, hot, and my drink had no ice in it, so my Dr. Pepper was warm. I ended up not eating my food or touching my drink again. My boyfriend enjoyed his meal though, that's the only reason I gave more than one star.

I realize it's still kinda quiet but you've been open for an hour and you're about to get the lunch rush. Why is there no one up there? Even after we seated ourselves in the bar area (where everyone in the restaurant was dining at the time) we still had to flag someone down because no one was paying attention. What's worse is that this seems to be a common problem in a lot of reviews. Management, take note.  The food itself is just cheese, salt, and butter - and not in a good way either. The nacho appetizer was drenched in cheese and they weren't really nachos; they were more like...cheese chips. Not what you'd envision nachos as being. For the main course for some reason I felt inspired to order a ribeye steak. Speaking of which, when the hell did Chili's start cooking steaks? Either way, it was just okay. Seasoning was eh, the slab of butter I could have done without, and the temperature was rare. **Regarding the temperature: I usually order medium all the time but I've just about given up on restaurants being able to actually cook their steaks right. Usually if I order medium it comes to me well done, so I felt adventurous and ordered medium rare thinking they'll cook it up one temperature to a medium. The plan backfired as it came out rare. I don't really mind rare and this isn't as much of an issue as I'm making it out to be but I'm just sayin'. Anywho, moving on, the mashed potatoes were a disaster. Loaded with way too much butter and were topped with some kind of hard cheese shell thing? I don't even know how to describe the damn thing but it was weird. As someone who makes the greatest mashed potatoes in the world I struggled with these things. Good potatoes go beyond massive slabs of butter.  The other member of my party ordered a chicken bacon club sandwich thing that was topped with so much lettuce that even a vegan would complain about it. Check out the pic.  Also, this restaurant is located in a massive plaza with about 40 other restaurants. If you approach this one from the west you'll notice that there's no sign on the side of the building to indicate that, yes, this is indeed a Chili's. Kind of odd. Service was nice, though. But the food was really eh, the potatoes were ehhhhh, and not having anyone take note of customers walking in was like what? At the end of the day it's a chain and you get what you pay for.

When shopping or dining, I show my military ID because I am proud of the service my husband does for our country (he is currently active duty, 12 years).  Then I thought about the spouses to the servicemen and women of our armed forces.  To say that they, we, don't serve is a slap in the face.  We choose not put down roots by moving every few years, are left behind when our loved ones deploy, are separated from our spouses for long periods time, and live with the hope that our husbands and wives return to us safely.   To the manager at Chili's that couldn't be bothered to look me in the eye to explain a policy for a discount that I didn't even ask for:  You're welcome that my family serves to protect you daily.  You can keep your food and your discounts, but you lose my patronage.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oceanside?start=80,2.44,2.81,2.81,2.308,2.662

Attentive: Check  Quick and timely: check From the first bite of the meal to the obligatory final offer for dessert, She was beyond impressive.  Some servers are not used to working with kids, and she had that in spades.  Instead of staggering the water with the chocolate milk (my kid is a drink-it-all-now-as-soon-as-I-get-it kid)  She brought he water and milk out at the same time.  in all my years of trying to figure out how to slow this process, the water threw off my daughter.  It was the first time that food service was able to change our dining experience in a positive manner, just by the rhythm of the items coming out.  It sounds stupid.  But it made a big deal when she had chocolate milk left over, and wasn't asking for either another one to be ordered, or some of whatever I was drinking.  Anyways. Then the cheese ball incident.  Somehow, the wings I ordered got the wrong sauce on them.  It happens.  This was remedied immediately, (see what I am saying? Crazy), with the plate returning with the correct items in under 90 seconds.  Damn.  You go girl.  In the kerfuffle of getting new food out, at some point out of my view, a frozen - uncooked, YES - cheeze buddy (cheese bites?) (not sure what they are called),  made its way into one of the dipping sauces.  just under the surface.  This plus wrong sauce, would have been game over.  But Again, IMMEDIATELY offered to remedy.  My reaction:  I ate it, therefore, it was on me.  Nothing left to fix.  She offered to replace, to comp, etc....her on the spot 'let me fix this NOW"" was so refreshing.  I remember when service USED to feel like this, and not in just the super fancy, ritzy places.  She is a dying breed of server:  ONE WHO TAKES PRIDE IN HER WORK.   Not sure where to go from here.  I think my bar just got re-set for every day dining service, and I am pretty sure that the rest of them are just waiting out there, ready to remind me she is a needle in a very large, food filled haystack.  Again Great Job, Alexa.   - RTJ",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oceanside?start=40,2.88,2.88,2.88,2.096,2.88

Harmless enough, any appetizers you find are likely pre-frozen and fried up, salads will come out of a mixed bag, and most of the spice will come from salt.  That's not to say the food is bad, it's just basic and unimaginative.  A lot of cheese, some bacon sprinkled on top, a side of fries, and some cream based dressing can make anything edible for a night.  And they serve beer, which is how they stay afloat along with happy hour, I'm sure. The employees are generally nice, though absent most of the time.  I think this stems from from the fact that there are mini-computers on each table that can take orders instead of a waiter of waitress that you have to pay.  We've had trips here where we see someone to make our initial order, someone else deliver, and then never see another soul unless we ask for a refill or the bill on that touch screen.  That's extremely lazy (or cheap) on Chili's part and a bit of a disservice to their customers. Still, as far as chain places go, it's generally more alright than disgusting.  There's nothing on the menu that you have to come back and try again, but there's rarely anything you won't push away either.  Again, coated with cheese and served with blue cheese, you'll probably not complain too much.  And if you stick with happy hour and maybe a dessert, you'll more than likely walk out with a smile and a light stomach ache.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oceanside,2.96,2.87,2.87,1.6720000000000002,2.9059999999999997

I left with my husband following me out as I burst into tears in the parking lot! When we arrived. As soon as we walked in we noticed a full restaurant and a 2 year old child standing ON a bar chair AT THE BAR--Where no one under 18 is allowed to sit. After waiting about 20 minutes a young host/ busser finally greeted and seated us and I asked him why the family was being allowed to sit at the bar with their child sitting on the seat. He said he would forward the complaint the manager and he sat us at my request ""Far away from that uncomfortable situation."" After we ordered our food and it came wrong. The manager walked over and apologized for the mistakes on my order. I told him that the mistakes on the food was fine but why has he not done anything about the law being broken at the bar. He replied by saying first that I was wrong and that it did not happen. Then he changed his story and said he watched them and she never put her baby down. After telling him that I had complained when I came in and taken a picture as well he changed his tune. Then he claimed ignorance to the law - stating ""I'm not from here"" -I didn't know a minor couldn't stand at the bar top. Then, he said he talked to them and they said "" We're not hurting or bothering anyone."" ( EXCEPT THAT- IT IS ILLEGAL!) Because I'm sure all the people at the bar appreciated drinking alcohol in the presence of an infant- an infant not being watched and about to fall off a bar stool.Then he asked me to explain to him what I would do.( LIKE THAT MATTERS !BECAUSE I WORK THERE RIGHT?? ) He then said he talked to his general manager and the General Manager did not care. This is where he left it. THAT THE GENERAL MANAGER IGNORES THE LAW. He had argued with me about this and wouldn't leave our table. My husband had to ask him to leave. When I went back to my food it was cold after having this stupid conversation. So now my food was wrong and cold. He heard me complaining loudly about my food being cold and he came and comp'd the order.

Here is where they fall short: 1) Service 2) Service getting us an extra Ziosk. Shouldn't be that hard. Everyone else does it. But everyone seemed to forget that we asked for an extra one.

When confronted about it we were told that chilis changed their glasses. Although we new that wasn't true because we have had a previous visit and the cups were the same. Then our appetizers came and that was fine. Dinner came and I was cutting my daughters steak up and as she ate a long hard white (object) looked like an worm but it didn't move. You couldn't cut it with a knife. When we confronted the waiter Brittany and Shawn (the manager) they stated that it was just fat. The skillet mash potatoes came on a plate and not a skillet. Finally we got dessert, we got the salted caramel molten and instead of putting that salted caramel they put cinnamon and sugar. When I confronted the waiter Brittany she argued that that's how it came. I pointed to the picture and explained that we had it before. She still tried to argue with me and I told her that no that's not how it comes. She then admitted that the chefs didn't prep the salted caramel for the topping.

14,Steve L.,"Oceanside, CA",6,8,4.0,5.0,2017-09-05,Chili's is back! I had a bad experience on the east coast 10 years ago. Haven't been back since until tonight. And tonight was great! The honey hipotle chicken and waffles was surprisingly exceptional! Tina our server was fantastic with her southern hospitality charm! I will definitely be returning for their late night specials!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oceanside,3.28,2.74,2.74,,2.9560000000000004
13,Jolene M.,"San Diego, CA",0,14,2.0,2.0,2017-09-24,"Brought our kids here and were seated near the kitchen.... which felt more like a bar... at 1am. The cooks and servers walking in and out cussing, flipping each other off and yelling in front of the kids the entire time.  It sounds like a bunch of 16 year olds run the place. The food wasn't bad but we definitely won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oceanside,3.32,2.71,2.71,,2.9539999999999997
9,Bell S.,"San Diego, CA",530,42,,5.0,2017-09-26,"Came here to satisfy my craving (being 5 months pregnant cravings are fierce) walking in at noon I was surprised to see no wait. Yelp was right on target about their ""no wait time"". Hostess opened up the door for us , sat us promptly. Very friendly server as well! This has been the fastest friendliest service we've had in some time. They've changed the menu again but luckily they still had what we came for - Santa Fe chicken salad and Santa Fe rolls. Yummmmmmmy! We will be back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oceanside,3.44,2.72,2.72,,3.0080000000000005
36,paula p.,"Los Alamitos, CA",1,17,,5.0,2017-10-27,"We spent the day at LEGOLAND and headed into the local Chili's since the kiddos and hubby wanted burgers. Chili's has some of the BEST burgers anywhere, seriously and I am not a big burger fan. So the hostess seated us immediately with no wait at all on a Saturday night at prime dinner time. Our server (Alexa) was by far the best server I've ever had in my 49 years of life, including 5 star Zagat restaurants. Not only did she apologize which was completely not necessary for a 5 minute wait to take our drink orders, she sent the manager to apologize to us for the delay, gave us a 10% discount on our meal, gave us free chips, dip and queso and free dessert. OH MY GOD. The food was fresh, delicious, consistent with other chili's locations but the HUGE difference here is the service was OVER THE TOP. We had a table of 5 who had drinks, dinner, appetizers and dessert with THE BEST SERVICE EVER  for 64.00 with tax!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oceanside?start=20,3.52,2.76,2.76,,3.064

I'm mostly served by kaylin who is on top of the bar, getting drunks right away and keeping it clean. It's chili's, I come for the bar, but it's exactly what I expect when I look around. People are working, laughing, food is coming out. It's my lunch spot, I recommend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oceanside,3.8,2.79,2.79,,3.194

6,Mary R.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",0,1,,2.0,2017-12-31,"This is regarding the male bartender on duty 12-31-2017 @ 4:20pm. I went in to the bar area, which was unusually empty for New Years Eve afternoon....There were plenty of open seats at the bar and plenty of open tables at the bar area. So I sit down and wait, and wait and wait. Finally the female bartender, who is trying to leave from her shift, while the on-duty bar tender is standing there washing the same glass over and over staring at the big screen, she asks me i've been helped yet. I said no and she immediately asked what I wanted and served me. After that I decided to just have one drink and leave. Soon after that, two girl college students come in and his face lights up and he serves them immediately. Hmmm, hope he likes the $0 tip I gave him. Hope he doesn't like his job and moves on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oceanside,3.72,2.73,2.73,,3.1260000000000003

Had one REALLY bad experience with a former manager named Shawn LaDeux. Stacy was all over it and fixed the issue. Shawn is no longer at this location . Lindsay and Javier are by far the best waiters at this location. Both LOVE conversation, engage in all topics and give a very welcoming vibe. Remembers orders. VERY friendly.  I DEFINITEY recommends the ""Blue Pacific"". This is an older drink that is longer on the menu.
