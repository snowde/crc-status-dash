10,Bryan T.,"Gardner, KS",18,16,2.0,4.0,2013-03-29,This particular Chili's always has quick service and low wait times even on Friday night.  The staff is always friendly and the store is clean.  This is one of the better Chili's we have around.  The food is just like every other Chili's.  I will say if you've never had the Salmon... try it.  It's delicious!  Always tender and tasty. And I highly recommend starting off your meal with some Skillet Queso.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-olathe,,,,,

8,Tricia S.,"Olathe, KS",0,1,,2.0,2014-09-05,"Wait time was ridiculous... Not to busy, the hostess was not trained very well... She'll take your name but won't remember... Once seated the wait staff are impossible to get great service.. I would pass this location at all cost this isn't the first time of terrible service here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-olathe,,,,,
7,Don E.,"Salina, KS",4,199,8.0,4.0,2016-04-01,"Very busy. Service for our bunch was good. Only had to ask for water once. Salads, bacon cheeseburger and smothered chicken burrito were above average. Although a typical Chilis, would go back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-olathe,,,,,
6,Sydney S.,"Olathe, KS",18,45,35.0,5.0,2016-08-15,"Ordered carryout last night, since we were at the hospital across the street with my grandma.  We ordered a couple orders of the Southwest Egg Rolls and the Santa Fe Chicken Salad. The girl who took our order was very friendly and thorough.  The food was ready when they said it would be. The manager also had the egg rolls cut for us, like they are served in the restaurant, even though they are served whole when togo.  Overall, the staff was friendly, and the food was hot and delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-olathe,,,,,
4,Deb G.,"Colorado Springs, CO",59,531,66.0,4.0,2016-12-22,"In an area with very few restaurant options, I was pleased to find this Chili's does an excellent job on their original buffalo chicken sandwich and fries.   The sandwich was prepared well and tasted like their old school style; and the fries were some of the best I've had in a while.  I also ordered an Appletini and it was fair; not quite the real thing, but still good.  The wait staff was also very friendly and provided good service.  Really glad the sandwich was so good; I went in looking forward to that dish and I was not disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-olathe,,,,,
5,Linda D.,"St. Louis, MO",0,2,,5.0,2017-05-05,This chili's has a remarkable general manager. ..makes the experience just great!  The food is really better than most all texmex and mexican restaurants. ..the margs are superior.  Highly recommended! !,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-olathe,,,,,
3,Calico S.,"Olathe, KS",72,17,40.0,1.0,2017-08-01,This was one of my worst restaurant visits that I've ever had.  It started from my greeting at the door by the hostess.  She had to ask me to have a seat while she cleaned my table off.  Then it took 15 minutes for someone to come to my table to take my drink order.  Then another 7 minutes for my drinks to come out.  I wanted to order an item from the happy hour menu but because it took so long to come back over to my table to take my order Happy Hour was over by 15 minutes.  Then my server walked away and didn't come back for another 18 minutes.  By this time I asked to be cashed out.  As I'm sitting and waiting for my check to appear on the kiosk I was informed that he forgot to send it.  So needless to say I spent 45 minutes of my life waiting for service,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-olathe,,,,,
0,Todd B.,"Power & Light District, Kansas City, MO",0,11,3.0,4.0,2017-08-15,Just another Chili's not sure how this location is still open. The place is almost empty. Good service and food. Just get a little creepy when you are one of four tables.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-olathe,,,,,
2,Autumn G.,"Kansas City, KS",0,2,3.0,1.0,2017-12-06,"It was pretty gross. Definitely the worst chilis I've ever been in. The table we sat at (booth closest to the door in bar area) was pretty gnarly. The window had a bunch of splatters on it, it was super dusty, looked like it hadn't been wiped down in ages. The women's bathroom was gnarly too.  FYI, not writing this to be mean. I love Chilis but the GM here needs some better staff members or be better at their job.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-olathe,,,,,
1,Susan B.,"Leawood, KS",29,77,66.0,1.0,2017-12-11,Okay so they asked me to call them and explain what happened on our horrible visit. They then proceeded to send me two $10 gift certificates after I wasted $70 and wasted almost two hours. No thanks Chili's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-olathe,,,,,
