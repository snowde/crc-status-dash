17,John D.,"Lubbock, TX",5,240,117.0,1.0,2013-05-16,"Absolute WORST Chili's I've ever dined at... Without a doubt. Yet I've been there enough times to know exactly why I hate it. So Here Goes. The staff usually greets you with a frown or smirk and sits you at a dirty, wet table. Then your server arrives and wants to know what you want, how you want it and when your leaving. Seriously, I feel rushed everytime I go, which usually leads to me taking way to long to eat to prove a point, which in turn makes me more mad I'm still there. The warmed up food is never good enough, the glasses are dirty, the sweet tea smells and tastes like a sewage treatment facility, the bar is consistently filled to the brim with loud and obnoxious a**holes that want nothing more in life than to scream, spill beer and chain smoke and worst of all is what you pay for all of that glory. If you still don't understand or believe this then try it out for yourself and I honestly hope your experience is better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orange-7,,,,,
13,Kat R.,"Orange, TX",94,89,46.0,3.0,2014-03-12,"I'm not sure how to feel about this place because its inconsistent as #&!* Let's be honest, the only reason I repeatedly come here is because Orange, Texas seriously lacks in restraunts that serve a vast variety of foods & drinks.... so Chili's has turned into that place to have a low key ""girl's night"", family outing or quick date.  I eat here more than I'd like to admit... and every single time it's a different outcome. I've had times where the food taste simply amazing with spectacular service.... then there are times that have been so horrid I've ended up getting free meals and apologies. I think it all boils down to whose cooking in the back and who you end up with as your waitress/waiter. I can say the two times I've had any major issue the manager on duty went above and beyond to make the situation right.  It's a gamble but really, what are your other local options besides Mexican or fast food?!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orange-7,,,,,
15,Randy H.,"Beaumont, TX",1,1,,1.0,2014-06-25,The service here is consistently horrible. I have never had a good experience here. The only reason I return is because I love the chipotle chicken strips lol.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orange-7,,,,,
10,Regina Q.,"Vinton, LA",0,46,64.0,5.0,2014-12-11,"Steak is very tender & tasty. Loaded potatoes are piping-hot! And the waitress, Peaches, is prompt & very friendly!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orange-7,,,,,
16,Madison B.,"Orange, TX",27,5,,1.0,2015-04-10,I absolutely used to love Chili's before they went down here. Horrible service. Servers are usually rude and do not check up on you. Takes a good while for food to arrive. You can hear them all screaming and talking in the kitchen from the dining area. Orders have been messed up more than once. I've ordered things numerous times only to find out later that they're out of the specific item.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orange-7,,,,,
14,Jennifer K.,"Bridge City, TX",0,15,1.0,3.0,2015-07-25,"There are only a couple of people that work here that are why I come back and they are both bartenders, and honestly the only good service I have had here is from them. So if Drew or Peaches are not tending bar, don't bother staying. As far as food, the steaks are usually okay depending on who is cooking that day but watch for it to be overdone half the time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orange-7,,,,,
4,Kitty W.,"Saint Louis, MO",175,269,2214.0,4.0,2015-12-04,"I guess I'm one of the few who has had a good experience here.  My dad, stepmom, and I had a late dinner here on a weeknight. My dad had a burger, and my stepmom ordered nachos. Being the health nut that I am, I went for a very light dinner for myself. I just ordered a house salad and an entire appetizer portion of chips and white spinach queso. Spinach is full of antioxidants. ;)  The food was good. It was what you would expect from a Chili's. My house salad had way too much shredded cheese on it, but keep in mind I am the one who chose to make a meal off of queso. It's possible I was getting cheesed out. Although I enjoyed the queso quite a bit, I'd make a couple of modifications if I ordered it again. It's topped with ""shredded Monterey Jack cheese, house-made pico de gallo, fresh guacamole, queso fresco & chopped cilantro."" I'd eliminate the shredded cheese because when melted, it's simply too heavy for Chili's delightfully thin chips. My chips kept breaking as I tried to scoop it up. I'd also ask for the tiny dab of guac to be served on the side. I'm not a huge fan of warm avocado. Though, by the time I get back to a Chili's, I doubt this particular queso will still be on the menu. They're constantly changing their offerings.  I didn't have the poor service others have mentioned. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. She immediately identified my stepmom's accent as Australian, which was nice because my stepmom is always getting peeved when people think she's English. Our waitress apparently wanted to go to Australia someday, and she really was fantastic. She even saved us some money. My dad had ordered his burger without fries, so when I ordered my house salad, she just counted that as his side. (I believe my salad as his side might have been an upcharge of a dollar.) The situation, however, became a little tense when my stepmom's nachos arrived. ""What--is this?"" she asked. They were the kind of nachos where each chip is individually topped. She had been expecting a chaotic pile of cheesy tortilla goodness, and she was visibly distraught. I understand the feeling. I also don't like surprises, but I really thought she was going to cry. Our waitress handled it well, and in the end, I think my stepmom liked the nachos. It just wasn't what she was expecting.  If there is one thing I cannot recommend here, it is the tap water. The tap water in Southeast Texas is horrible. I was in town for only a few days, and I automatically ordered a water without thinking. Gross! It was awful! I lived in the area for nearly 30 years. How could I have forgotten? So, I ended up ordering a Diet Coke. That's right. Chili's has a Freestyle, giving me all the soda options I could ever want, and I ordered a Diet Coke.  I live in Missouri, so I'm obviously not a regular at this Chili's. But I'm happy it's stayed in Orange for as long as it has. It's been here since at least 2009, and it's one of the only large restaurants Orange has. I've never had a bad experience here, and my most recent visit in October 2015 was a pretty good one. The food probably was closer to 3 stars, but I'm bumping my rating up to 4 stars because of our waitress.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orange-7,,,,,
11,Stephanie W.,"Lake Charles, LA",21,13,14.0,5.0,2016-01-18,We had a great experience at this Chili's!! The food was very fresh and tasted great!! Service was excellent!! 5 stars!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orange-7,,,,,

9,Brandi C.,"Vinton, LA",2,53,22.0,5.0,2016-04-25,Love this restaurant and the services. Food is always good and service is always fast. They have the best bartender I've ever met. Her name is Peaches. She makes the BEST Bloody Mary's!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orange-7,,,,,
12,Alexa R.,"Orange, TX",31,2,,1.0,2016-05-27,"My family and I has been there multiple times, and every. single. time, the service is slow. We left after 15 minutes and no drink order...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orange-7,,,,,
7,Ashley M.,"Orange, TX",46,36,164.0,4.0,2016-10-17,"Was an average chilis environment great food, good people, and ok service. The only thing is being knowledgeable about if they give military discount and need to work on conversing among one another in front of customers i get this is a small town but no need to ingnore guess.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orange-7,,,,,
3,T L.,"Golden, CO",1,2,1.0,1.0,2016-11-03,"Being one of the few restaurants in Orange with an extensive menu and a bar, it is unfortunate that this Chili's is not a more inviting establishment. We arrived for dinner last night and were welcomed with temperatures one would find in a refrigerator.  The floor was full of trash, including the remains of a cigarette, which was still there when we left.  It took more than 10 minutes to get a drink.  After we ordered, we were informed that that they were out of quinoa, which came with one of the dishes.  This is fine, but to replace the quinoa with something that wasn't already on the plate, there would be an extra fee.  Our server was pleasant, although not very attentive. The food was OK, and on par with what one would expect from Chili's.  The manager needs to put more attention into the store.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orange-7,,,,,
6,Heath D.,"Columbus, OH",97,172,130.0,2.0,2017-05-07,"I should've heeded the reviews. Started off great. Host was friendly. Server took a little longer to get to us initially but no worries, we aren't super picky. Got our order in and all...everything was fine. Meals came out after a bit of a wait and the server apologized for the delay, saying he didn't want to keep my burger back there waiting any longer just getting cold. He said they were still waiting on fries--which I didn't have with the meal. About 5 minutes later my fries showed up. I had asked for another drink then. Probably 5 minutes or so went by, still no drink. I had to waive him down to get that. That was kind of par for the course with the guy. Even after we had eaten our side salads we didn't see him again until our meals came. He hadn't asked if we were ok or removed our salad plates--which made for a little awkwardness when he brought our food and was trying to negotiate where to put it on our little two person table. Another thing that got me with the server is when I pointed out to him that there were cucumbers on my burger. He told me they weren't cucumbers but were their home made pickles. They were cucumbers, and I corrected him and just told him it was fine and I didn't want to argue about it, I was just letting him know. By this time I was almost done with the burger. I think some more server training is needed at the location. We like chilis and will only be in town for a week. Bummed that this locale is not better as we had hoped it would be our go-to for dinners this week...but I'm not going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orange-7,,,,,
0,Scott G.,"Orange, TX",31,18,7.0,5.0,2017-09-19,"This is my go-to restaurant. The menu is varied enough for many different tastes and the food is always good and plentiful. I have yet to have a bad experience at any of their restaurants, even if I go during busy hours.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orange-7,,,,,
5,Sam C.,"Pampa, TX",0,1,,1.0,2017-09-25,"I miss being able to sit down and eat a fresh and warm meal. Every time I go to this chilis its has been a disappointment. Slow and inattentive waiters, and the food has been cold every time. I have also waited more than an hour for a dish, and it was cold. This place needs new management.  I do not recommend!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orange-7,,,,,
2,James B.,"Orange, TX",0,4,1.0,1.0,2017-10-07,Worst service in my life. They were not busy so no excuse for the horrible service. Looks like  this may be my final visit and I will spread the word also.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orange-7,,,,,
1,Elizabeth J.,"Lake Charles, LA",12,7,3.0,2.0,2017-11-12,Came in on a Sunday after lunch hour with my family. Waitress seems careless.
