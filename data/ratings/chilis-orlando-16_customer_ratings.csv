The table hadn't been cleaned all that well and was a little sticky, and I can't say the bits of missed food in between the tiles on the table surface was all that appetizing... but generally I don't let things like that get to me so all in all we had a successful lunch.

Ordered it medium... was served a well done steak. Sent it back. Spent my entire lunch hour waiting on my food. Anyway, they had to bring it out in a to-go box. I went back to work hungry.

30,Russ F.,"Oviedo, FL",24,105,8.0,3.0,2012-11-20,Ok going into Chillis you have to know your not going to get a perfectly cooked piece of meat. Like most chain type of places they prefer cooking it so as not to get anyone sick. That said I order mine one less than I prefer and hope it doesn't comes out well done(ask for it medium rare if you want it medium). I like the fact they allow call ahead seating.  I usually get the two for twenty deal with the guacamole and salsa app. Each time the servers are always nice and attentive and quick to offer the two for one drink specials they always have. So if you want a less expensive night out go here just don't expect a steak house experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orlando-16?start=40,2.284,2.284,2.284,2.284,2.284

There was a time where you could get a truly awesome burger here but that is not the case anymore. I ordered the bacon cheeseburger medium rare and got a well done dry patty instead, it wasn't even pink inside. The fries were tasteless and lukewarm, it was very disappointing.  Really the only memorable thing out of the entire dining experience was that they do a 2 for 1 happy hour, but check out the size of the beer mugs versus the price for one beer and you're probably still getting jipped.

26,Emily C.,"Phoenix, AZ",226,10,,4.0,2013-12-19,"I have been coming and going to this restaurant for many years. I remember turning 21 and rejoicing at the fact that I was now privy to 2-for-1 Margaritas :) The margaritas are weak, but 2 glasses of wine for $6 is always a treat. Happy hour all day everyday is nothing to sneeze at.  On my most recent visit to chili's, I used my  favorite money saving device ""retail me not"" and found coupons for free appetizers with the purchase of an adult entree. The waitress kindly informed me that it was a better deal than the two for 20 option because you receive more food. 2 cool points for her.  They most recently installed a system in where you can play games commonly found for free on the Iphone for a mere 99 cents per visit..and you can now order your own drinks and dessert  ( isn't that what the waitress is for?). I ordered the crusted Tilapia and it  tasted like cheesy heaven, especially after margarita number dos..  I did however notice a difference in texture of the broccoli on my plate vs my dinner companion ( soggy vs crispy) The bottom line is, chili's has always been a staple. The service is good, the food is tasty, the drinks are bogo and it is not terribly expensive. If you are looking for moderately priced Tex- Mex  and 2 for 1 Margaritas, Chili's delivers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orlando-16?start=40,2.352,2.352,2.352,2.352,2.352

I don't feel they are attentive. I don't expect the server to come to me every 5 minutes but I do expect to come to ask if I'm happy with my meal.   We ordered the 2 for $20 and grilled chicken with corn of the cob for the girls their food came quick their grilled chicken was juicy and delicious. I ordered the bacon avocado chicken I was happy with it very juicy and tasty w sweet potato fries and mashed potatoes. The hubby got chicken fajitas w a side of rice and beans. The rice was hard...it was barely even cooked it seemed microwaved.. beans tasted like a bowl of salsa was put inside of it. I consider fajitas to be Mexican I'm Spanish and the rice and beans are just different ..i do understand is more americanized but the rice was just plain hard. we finished our appetizers and the girls finished their food ( I ordered first for them) there was abt 5 plates on our table and the food runner delivers our food handing us the plates with pretty much no space in the table for the plates...  she didn't bother to take them.. I told her can you please takes these. She just said I'll be back while I held a plate in my hand cause there was no space...needles to say she never came back. It was actually a hassle for someone to take some freaking plates off our table. It seemed like not even our server wanted to take them. I was just pissed. Food was good. The queso was runny and my strawberry lemonade wasn't that great.. Will I be back..???.I have to think about it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orlando-16?start=40,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.12

56,Thysis R.,"Orlando, FL",182,238,734.0,3.0,2014-10-12,"This was the only place that had a decent wait time on a Friday evening. We arrived around 7:30 and had a 15-20 minute wait which was normal. We were seated within that timeframe so their estimate was spot on. We had one person take our drink orders and ended up with a different person for the rest of the evening. Chilis used to be soooo much better! I honestly think they are trying to do too much with the menu. They now serve ""Tex Mex"" items like enchiladas and burritos. I know that they are known for their fajitas which are pretty good but the other stuff I'm not so sure about. We decided to order the 2 for $20 which includes one appetizer to share and each gets a entree. We shared the cheesy Texas fries and both got the sirloin steak dinner. For drinks my friend ordered sweet tea and I ordered the Presidente Margarita. Drinks came out timely but both tastes awful. Sweet tea is supposed to be sweet but this wasn't sweet at all. The waitress explained that sometimes it's the way they make it as to why you may get one cup of really sweet tea and the next is not so sweet. Seriously? She would have been better off keeping quiet because even my 12 year old knows how sweet tea making works! Lol! My friend just ended up adding a couple of sugar packets. I was really disappointed with my margarita. It was so watered down. Totally not what I remembered a Presidente margarita tasting like.  It took a while for the entrees to come out but they finally arrived. I ordered my steak as to be medium and my friend ordered his a well done. I chose broccoli and corn on the cob for my sides and he chose broccoli and southwest Mac n cheese for his. The broccoli and corn were cooked perfect. My steak was as rare as it could be. I had to send it back because it was no where cooked to medium. Let's just say that I probably won't get steak again. It overall lacked flavor and tasted weird. I didn't even finish it. My friend seemed ok with his as he cleared his plate. We opted out of dessert because quite frankly I was ready to leave. Hopefully they will get their act together but this will be on the bottom of restaurant choices for me in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orlando-16?start=20,2.0280000000000005,2.0280000000000005,2.0280000000000005,2.0280000000000005,2.0280000000000005

My boyfriend and I both ordered the fajitas. After eating 2 of the tortilla's I noticed 4 very blatantly placed short black hairs sitting on top of the third tortilla.  I immediately notified my server, who in turn notified the manager. The manager came to my table and said that she was sorry and told us that if we had any more issues to let her know and left, but she did not return to our table and that was the last time we saw her the entire evening. The server mentioned that she was not sure how this had happened since the tortilla's come packaged and that they use a press.

But after dropping off our drinks and walking away without a word, he went around to check on all of his other tables multiple times before coming back and asking if we were ready to order. After taking our orders, he forgot what we had ordered for our appetizer, and had to come back and ask what it was(because he didn't bother writing down the order). After that, we never saw him again until I flagged him down to grab boxes after we were finished eating. He did not even bring the amount of boxes we had asked for, and I had to ask him for another one. He then offered to bring us bags, without us asking for them, and seemed exasperated regardless. We had to ask a different server for for refills when she brought us our food. We paid our meal through the table side system(which was the only perk of this meal) and left. As we were leaving, we overheard him talking with another server about finishing up with sweeping his tables, rolling his silverware, and ""Getting the hell out of there."" Now that I had heard all at, I understood that he had been prioritizing his side work above his tables, I was even more upset than I had been before. I have been serving for over three years, and I don't know if this was bad training or if he simply didn't care, but either way I will never go to this Chili's again, and will encourage others to not go here as well.

What made the experience worse was that for the first time the manager did not even have the courtesy to visit our table. My wife had to share a meal with me so she could eat. The server said she would get rid of the meal from the check but only deducted part of it. The steak was and additional $4 for the 10 ounce which was deducted.

I figured no problem, I was a waitress once and I know how Friday nights can be. We then ordered flat bread and a buffalo chicken sandwich. After 25 minutes we asked one of the waitresses in the area how long it would be. She left, came back, and unapologetically stated that it would be a while longer. At this point I was already half way through my second glass of tea. I saw the family of four that was seated around the same time we were and they had received their meals. Ten minutes after we asked how our food was coming, one of the waitresses brought our meals. The flat bread was stiff and overcooked, and the chicken sandwich was cold. Since both waitresses asked how our food tasted, I suspect the communication between employees is poor. We were brought the check and nothing was taken off the bill. In my waitressing experience, if someone's food took a long time, we would suggest they get an appetizer, remind the guest we haven't forgotten about them, or at least comp the drinks. I don't try to find ways to receive free food, but the service was poor and if you want to keep a customer you need to convey to them that you actually care about their eating experience. Or pretend you care. Won't be eating here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orlando-16?start=40,2.24,2.24,2.24,2.5000000000000004,2.24

But service is kind of lacking. Busy Friday night and the hostess told us to wait by a dirty table in the bar area so we could skip the waiting line. Well.. The table took forever to get cleaned. We weren't those annoying people to ""sit"" in the dirty table, we simply stood next to it and asked a server if they could get someone to clean it for us. Server never came back, nor did anyone really. Not for a while. Then, another issue was me waiting a while before my server came back to tell him my rice was undercooked... Like badly. My boyfriend asked him to make a margarita with Avion and he kept looking at us and asking ""with what??"" Avion... Tequila... He had very little knowledge with the food menu as well. Lucky for him I'm not a picky eater and will try anything!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orlando-16?start=20,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.7960000000000003,2.44

I do notice that after the servers bus the tables he wipes them down. I feel like there should be two hosts if he's going to do that. Our server was nice but she took 10 minutes to take our drink orders and she forgot our chips and salsa, but that's not the downside. It was the fact that the chips and salsa are only free at the bar and lounge area and not the dining area when they used to be free depending on the meal choice.  We ordered fried asparagus, onion rings (which had no seasoning and sprinkling cilantro doesn't count), fajitas, and the bacon cheese quesadillas.

The service was lack-luster though. The restaurant wasn't too packed, but it still took the waitress 10 minutes (yes, I counted) to just take our drink orders. I watched her mood change when we only ordered waters to drink. Our food took about 40-45 minutes to come out (again, big parties usually take longer), but some of the orders were missing sides and the server never once came to check up on our table. Members of our party had to track her down to get drink refills and the missing sider. Not looking forward to coming back, honestly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orlando-16,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24
3,Jade R.,"Orlando, FL",114,156,265.0,3.0,2016-09-29,"Overall, this Chilis is decent. I have visited here many times over the years. I feel Chilis is constantly rebranding itself, and they seem to have a new menu or food options each time we come. But this option does see some heavy traffic flow, yet wait times are not usually long, and the restaurant itself is well maintained.  The 2 for 1s are still the best value. They offer a wide selection of what you can get for that offer, so its a real money saver. I prefer either the margaritas or the blue long islands. The drinks are tasty, but nothing extraordinary. I love their bean dip. I could eat that all night. As for the rest of their food, again, its decent but nothing memorable. Chilis is a place to go for drinks and food as an easy, inexpensive stop without settling for fast food. They can usually accommodate larger parties (like 8+) without too much of a hiccup. Our server tonight, Greg, was great. He joked with our group, and was really personable. You don't always see that much anymore.  3 stars for decent food with quick service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orlando-16,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32
