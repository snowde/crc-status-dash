After a really disappointing dining experience-or lack of, our party of 3 ventured into the familiar world of Chili's.  Since we were pressed for time and trying to not freeze under the vents in the booths, we sat in the bar area.  April, our server, was efficient, friendly and attentive to our dining experience. We started off with the complimentary salsa and chips and then went right in with the 1/2 rack of ribs. I enjoyed the memphis dry rub.. gives a different taste but in a good way!  Plenty of tvs around to watch your sporting preference, we sat in an optimal place to view the b-ball game, golf and crossfit training tournaments.  Prices are standard. $10 for 1/2 a rack of ribs and fries. Great happy hour specials available all day as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orlando-8?start=40,2.668,2.668,2.668,2.668,2.668
41,Mike Z.,"Orlando, FL",372,468,892.0,3.0,2012-04-30,"The existing 3-star reviews are probably the most accurate. I sometimes come here when I am near the airport and have to wait for a while for someone I'm picking up at the airport to arrive or if I have time to kill while waiting to depart. It isn't my favorite Chili's by any means. I have been to some that I have really liked and some that are average. This one falls into the latter category. The employees here were very nice during my most recent visit, which was this past Friday. I had a Presidente margarita and Texas-style French fries (with cheese, peppers, etc.) and hung out at the bar for about half an hour. Both the drink and food were good and I was treated very pleasantly. The atmosphere in here was a little bit weird, though. I was in here between maybe 2:15-2:45 on Friday and it was a little hectic and crazy inside. The group sitting behind me at the stand-alone bar table was very rowdy and loud, and I'm unsure what they were doing acting that way at that time and on a weekday. It was reminiscent of what some groups of people do in downtown Orlando on Fri./Sat. nights. They definitely were partying and carrying on, though it wasn't anything overly inappropriate (i.e. no bad language, etc.). I just wasn't expecting for such a wild celebration to be taking place at that time on a weekday (yes, it was a Fri., so maybe they got out of work early and got their weekend started before many others did). Oh, well. Maybe I just felt weird about it because I was tired, drove all the way to the area without my air conditioning working and the person who I was picking up at the airport had their flight delayed. Anyway, I'm sure that many people will find this Chili's to be much like many of the others, though I just don't like it as much as a few others I've been to. And, of course, I wouldn't go to it unless I was going to the airport before/after or just happened to be near it. (I live in College Park.) Overall, it is what it is. Of course, it always is nice to have 2-for-1s for many alcoholic drinks all day, every day ... but that's at (as far as I can tell) every Chili's, so there isn't a whole lot separating this one from the others. The ones in Alt. Springs and Lake Mary are the ones I've been to the most and are, in my opinion, nicer and the ones I'm much more likely to regularly return to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orlando-8?start=80,2.668,2.668,2.668,2.668,2.668

We didn't do official seating we sat at the bar, waitress was very friendly and super nice her name was Kelly so S/o's to her.. but sincerely the food was just ok. I had a like 4 long island ice teas so the bar tender did a great job on those. One thing we didn't like was the fact that they took all the coasters out and the tables are in tile so the waitress had to give us bar napkins for us to put our drinks on them because if not, it would've gotten our table all wet. So that was pretty lame, but all in all it was a pleasant experience. We ordered some chicken appetizer platter with southwestern egg rolls which are my favorite but the regular crisp chicken tenders  I do not recommend.  Batter was soggy and the chicken was chewy.

44,Love B.,"Chatsworth, CA",377,109,105.0,2.0,2013-07-23,"This was my first time having lunch at this specific Chili's and I must say that I was really looking forward to their fajita combo special that they've had on their menu for years.  I was so disappointed with the way they cooked both the chicken and the steak.  If it wasn't for us being engaged in a great dialogue together about what the future holds, I would've brought it up to the management team but the food was below average. The cooks may have had an off day or it may have been a new chef trying it out and he didn't cook it the way Chili's usually does so I may give them another chance the next time I'm staying in Orlando but I walked about annoyed. Their hostess wasn't the most pleasant person and I'm always confused when restaurants don't shop their own hostess to see how good of a job they do.  It's so difficult to judge a hostess based on an interview versus how they really treat people when they first arrive to your restaurant. Just like in sports I think she may have done better playing a different position such as a behind the scenes employee instead of the role she was playing. And out waitress needs to be reminded to smile more often.  Other than the the ice tea was great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orlando-8?start=80,2.568,2.568,2.568,2.568,2.5680000000000005
90,Stephanie P.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",948,1027,25111.0,4.0,2013-08-23,"So on the last day of my Orlando vacation my boyfriend and I had practically empty wallets but still wanted to enjoy the end of our trip...we needed to refuel with lunch because we overslept and missed our hotel's complimentary breakfast and we had seen a commercial for Chili's the night before as we randomly caught up with Dexter, drank wine and ate cheese (I know, we're lushes). Now this Chili's commercial had said something about a $9.99 ""Triple Dipper Meal"" and my sweet prince decided that he needed that in his life sooner rather than later.  Surprise, there was a Chili's only a short drive from our hotel so the next day it had to happen. Obviously.  Upon entering we were seated immediately and our waiter gave us menus, introduced himself and went on to make some recommendations and get us drinks. Service throughout the rest of the meal was pretty great and even the manager stopped by at one point to see how we were doing. My boy went with his craving and went with the ""Tripple Dipper"" and I went for a lunch combo. ______________________________________________________________ The ""Tripple Dipper"" choices are pretty interesting and provide a variety of calorie-filled deliciously 'bad for you' treats! The options include:  +   Original Chicken Crispers (really they're fried/battered chicken tenders) +   Boneless Buffalo Wings  +   Boneless Honey-Chipotle Wings +   Southwestern Egg Rolls (they're filled with pepper, corn & other stuff I don't like) +   Big Mouth Bites (burger sliders, YUM!!) +   Hot Spinach & Artichoke Dip +   Loaded Potato Skins ______________________________________________________________ The options my beau went with were the original Chicken Crispers, boneless Buffalo Wings and the Southwestern Egg Rolls...ohhhhh how I yearned for Spinach & Artichoke Dip, lol - next time. He gave me a Chicken Cripser to try and it wasn't bad, but the meat to batter ratio was more off than I generally prefer. The meat was juicy and tasty but the batter was super greasy and not crunchy - these were actually better when microwaved as leftovers the next day, haha! I didn't try his other two selections because I don't handle spicy foods well. For my lunch I went with a lunch combo with comes with a soup and an entree. For the soup I chose the most ridiculous soup on their menu - the LOADED BAKED POTATO SOUP. It came topped with applewood smoked bacon, cheese, and fresh scallions. IT WAS AMAZING.  I'm also pretty sure it was the stuff heart attacks dream about and arteries have nightmares about - but it was an out of this world, delicious, buttery, creamy, potato laden, bacon lover's dream...also in that ""this must be awful for you but I want to eat this every single, DAMN DAY"" - kinda way. Yeah. My entree was their Bacon Ranch Chicken Quesadilla. It came stuffed with applewood smoked bacon, a pretty generous amount of deliciously seasoned & juicy as f@#! chicken, cheese and served with their signature dressing...which to me was a cross between chipotle mayo, Russian dressing with a touch of sour cream. In other words, delicious - it also came with french fries...with the potato skins on em, just the way I like it.  As far as drinky poos go, Chili's Happy Hour is 2-for-1 ALL DAY, EVERY DAY. The boy went with regular lime margaritas on the rocks with a salt rim and I went for raspberry margs with a sugary, red sugar rim. Both were refreshing, tasty and not too heavy on the sugary syrups - but neither packed a punch with the tequila content - BOOOOOOOOOO here. In all we were pleased with what we got for what we paid for and we ended up taking some back to the hotel fridge and enjoying it the next day.

Update@ so I finally get a call back for some at Chilis management and they at like it is not a big deal.  Yes it is a hassle for you but really 8 out 10 times, Chilis will get paid out due to their merchant agreement, so what ls the big deal.  So I ask the rep for a copy of the receipt of the transaction and I am told no.  The rep says go ahead and file a police report and if  I file the police report  they will only give it to the investigator. if a report is ever looked into.  Really I am only a victim of CC theft for a short time ultimately it is really up to the CC company to file a ciminal complaint.   Great bussiness model Chilis!  I ask if they could perserve the video from that night of the 8 poeple dining on my cc and I am told the location has no video and most of their locations dont.  The Chili's rep stated cc theft happens all the time and it is what it is.  Of course he also shares it was a party of 8 people have drinks and food on a stolen cc. But really why should they care, the server was tipped and 8 out 10 times they get paid.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orlando-8?start=40,2.96,2.96,2.96,1.988,2.96

2,Devon R.,"Phillipsburg, NJ",11,39,150.0,4.0,2015-09-03,"Service was good, but here's the lowdown on the food.....  Appetizers: The triple combo which included fried buffalo chicken wings, fried cheese chunks ( not sure of the official name, because they were just fried cheese chunks). The fried pickles were a greasy, soggy mess. They were not crunchy at all, even after removing the skin off the pickles, it didn't even have a crunch and we passed on those. The buffalo style chicken was your typical bar style buffalo chicken wings and the cheese chunks was decent. But I must warn you that the Chef must be obsessed with All spice AKA season salt aka Lawry's seasoning, because all three were garnished with it. Next, main dish: I got your everyday run of the mill bacon cheeseburger, with thick hearty bacon, overall I liked it. It came with french fries and you guessed it, all spice garnishing, plain and simple, it was good. In this case the seasoning was greatly appreciated. The wife got the Pick two mexican combo, substitute the rice and beans for house salad and french fries with chicken tostado and a chicken soft taco. I was told that the salad was a little wilted and a little bit too soft for her liking. She only ate the chicken taco, because the chicken tostado was overly garnished with the all spice so much,  that it has the possibility of shooting up your blood pressure. The french fries was very good though with the ranch dressing. Drinks: I'm usually a pina colada type guy, but they didn't have any, so I had to settle for a strawberry daiquiri, which was comped because it didn't taste good at all, it was very tart and that was even without the alcohol. Overall: Probably wont be in the Top 15, but if we don't have anything to do, we will be back.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orlando-8?start=20,2.68,2.68,2.68,2.416,2.68

21,Fawn G.,"Grayson, GA",0,17,2.0,5.0,2017-02-04,"Chili's TOGO. We arrived in Orlando after 9 hours in the car and didn't want to sit in a loud restaurant (or any restaurant for that matter). My husband whipped out his phone, Googled Chili's and found this location close to the hotel. Parking lot was full, 'traunt was packed and loud, staff ran in and out of kitchen with no acknowledgement of me waiting to pick up food. Suddenly an angel emerged from the kitchen, floated in my direction and smiled. After asking my name and hitting a few keys on the register, she directed a young girl to retrieve my order. Before the girl could walk away a man stepped into her and asked for a TOGO order. The girl began asking him questions, but the angel intervened. In seconds I was standing there with my TOGO dinner and the man was calmly placing his order. If you go on a Friday, be patient because all of Orland will be there too! But my advice is order ahead and eat in the piece and quiet of a hotel room.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orlando-8?start=40,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
74,Mark K.,"Rockledge, FL",5,15,4.0,1.0,2017-03-19,"First, it's loud. And no napkins allowed on table BEFORE food is served. What?   Been an hour. No food. Got napkins. Bribed with a cheap-o appetizer. Still too loud.  Waiting for manager to appear. It's two days after St. Patrick's Day and they're still serving GREEN rice. Really?  Now we're arguing over the menu. Beans were a no-show.  Manager arrived and apologized all over himself. Bryan.  BTW. Manager confessed the meats in the bowls is frozen. THATS NOT FRESH.  Prime rib can not be served pink. Ours was black. And previously frozen.  We are local residents and don't want to return",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orlando-8,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
73,Melinda Blondie V.,"Saint Cloud, FL",99,60,425.0,1.0,2017-05-05,First time here and it may be my last. We came for lunch and didn't get drinks until after the apps were served and when my food finally came  the chicken wasn't even hot the asparagus was raw and dry. The best part of my meal was the street corn. Our Server and didn't come check in us until time to pay.  Then when the check came I questioned why I was being charged separately for the sides he said it says the sides I chose said $1.00 more on the menu and I told him that is not what he told me when i asked if I had to have rice and beans. He told me I can choose any side. He looked at me walked away ripped up the receipt and left. His manager had to come take care of us and apologized and took care if the issue. It was extremely unprofessional.   Not a good first impression at all.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orlando-8,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32

She always greets us with a smile as we sit down, and knows our drink order by heart. You always see her treat all guests with respect.

77,Jacques L.,"Orlando, FL",7,12,17.0,2.0,2017-05-25,"Me and my woman have been here at least 3 times before with no problems, but this time was different. There was an intense presence of flies. Just numerous flies flying around our meal and drinks. I don't take the time to come to a restaurant, eat INSIDE, and still have to deal with flies. It's highly unsatisfactory and unsanitary and unprofessional. It made us not want to eat as relaxed and leisurely as usual. This is by far my worst experience at any Chili's ever!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orlando-8,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
76,Bob W.,"Orlando, FL",12,48,15.0,2.0,2017-07-05,"Went with friends last evening and I was very disappointed.   It was obvious that they were not prepared for a crowd.  The server seemed to constantly apologize.  I ordered crispers with corn on the cob and fries.  The crispers were warm at best.  The corn has no flavor and cold.  The fries were lukewarm.  The server took this off our bill.  One of our friends order was wrong missing the chicken.  The server had to take care of that.  I know that we will not be returning anytime soon, if ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orlando-8,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
75,A. C.,"Orlando, FL",136,1164,8699.0,2.0,2017-07-21,"(7/17/2017)  Got a pick up from the airport and this Chili's is on the right hand side of the road (going northbound), yeah, that's how we picked it.  It was late, but there were still a few folks, like maybe 2 other tables having dinner.  I was feeling super nauseous, having just stepped off  a plane, ordered a soup and salad combo.  House Salad was sufficient, a ""side"" salad, lettuce was a touch wilty around the edges, pieces kind of large and unwieldy.  I didn't touch the soup that night, but had it the next day for lunch  Was very thick and creamy, some hard bacon bits thrown in, rather cheesy (in a Velveeta sort of way, but that's not a bad thing).  Dining partner enjoyed the Honey-Chipotle Chicken Crispers (just a deep-friend tender, in case you were wondering) with a side of fries.  Waitress was very attentive at first, then disappeared halfway through.   As soon as went to talk to a manager about finding her (so we could get our check and leave), she popped up.  Table was dirty when we were sat by the host (he got an equally dirty wet rag to wipe it off).  It would suffice if you were stuck in the one of the hotels nearby.  There was a bar substantially full with people (they must've been one of the stuck ones).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orlando-8,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
6,Phil G.,"Piermont, NY",1,23,,1.0,2017-08-03,"Went to chilis 2 nights in a row. Tonight I ordered 2 grilled margarita chickens and a bacon cheeseburger. I waited about 30 minutes for the order to arrive. I brought all The food back to the hotel. Upon opening up the food ,my daughter in laws burger was some chicken and boneless wings app.  I walked back to chilis and handed the app to barmaid I said could I please get a burger instead of wings. A manager came over and said ""I'm sorry about the mistake. She ordered a new burger and then dismissed me like a kid when she said ""have a seat and we will bring you the food"" so I sat by the bar for approximately 20 minutes when the barmaid brought my burger . She than said ,you can keep the  app as we will throw it out anyway. I told her I don't want the 1 hour old app. I told her that I m really taken back that the manager didn't offer a drink or refund of burger.  I will never go back to this chilis. This manager needs a lesson in good managing. It's not just the customers that scream the loudest, sometimes customers that should be compensated but don't make a big fuss are the ones that should be compensated the most. I urge all customers to check your order before you leave so this doesn't happen to you. And I hope the manager on duty "" I think her name was Amy. Should get more training on how to be a competent manager.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orlando-8?start=20,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36

71,Holly W.,"Winter Park, FL",195,37,78.0,4.0,2018-01-05,"I'll give it three stars. Normally this location is very busy and an extreme wait. It must've been my lucky day when I went because it was slow, empty parking lot, and no wait (or so I thought).  My friend and I walked in and the host told us it would be just a second and she would get us seated... we sat there for ten minutes and watched her play on her phone. While we were wondering why we weren't being sat as there was SEVERAL open tables. Another group of three walked in and she told them the same story.. but they walked out and the host didn't even notice because she was on her phone. Eventually told us she was waiting for ""more servers"" but we saw several just standing around.  Eventually she did seat us, but seemed extremely annoyed finally after 10 minutes. Tyler was our server and  he was excellent. Very efficient, friendly, just all around a great server.  The food was good, but nothing I would rave about. I had the loaded potato soup, and buffalo ranch chicken sandwich. Mediocre at best.  Honestly, in the end Tyler saved the review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-orlando-8,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
