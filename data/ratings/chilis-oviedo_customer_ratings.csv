They have a great kids menu - great happy hour specials.  It really makes the whole family happy. For me, I've been eating the same food at Chili's since high school - Chicken Fajitas. They are simply the best around.  I've tried a couple of other things- but it always comes back to fajitas.  Especially if you get the 2 for $20 meal - and fajitas are on the list. The Oviedo location is nice - always gets busy - but it's the place to be seen in town!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oviedo?start=40,2.576,2.576,2.576,2.576,2.576
23,Rick S.,"Orlando, FL",8,454,6.0,4.0,2012-08-31,"Best burgers around, the wait is long but that's because there is no place else to eat around here. Prices are reasonable, and the servers are great for the most part. Whoever trains their waiters is doing a great job, give them a raise. The one thing they need to do is expand the building or open another Chillis closer to Lockwood road, hell open anything decent on Lockwood road. This location is so busy I know they lose customers, many times we drove by and left because of the wait. If your in Oviedo, this is pretty much it. Unless you want to go to Millers Ale house that has crappy service, food and long wait times. Added They now have you use a tablet on the table to buy liquor and pay your bill. I am not sure if I like that.  I can see having a problem with it if you are splitting the check or have to have your bill adjusted. I just don't think having a tablet at the table is sanitary. I love my tablet but having a community table is just a germ collecting device. I guess you can still have the pay waitress option since the kiosk only takes credit cards.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oviedo?start=40,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.48

We told the waitress and she came back with a vegetarian burger. That one had a quarter dollar size piece of bacon on it. REALLY!! the second time. More than that, it looked like they just removed the bacon from the first burger and did a lousy job of that. How shitty is that!! Its totally disgusting for a vegetarian to taste bacon.

33,Jessica S.,"Altamonte Springs, FL",14,22,,2.0,2013-07-04,"As a big fan of Chili's for years, I have to say I am not going back to this location any time soon. I've been there twice in the past four months, and both times the service was just utterly disappointing. Once we sat in the dining room and the next time we sat in the bar. On our second visit, the server didn't approach us for several minutes. And then it took almost 10 minutes to get our drinks from the bar. And then our server disappeared for a few minutes more before returning. We ordered fajitas, a chicken dish on the lighter side menu, and two kids' meals among the four of us. We also ordered a guacamole appetizer. The server took several minutes to bring out our chips and salsa, and forgot the guacamole. The chips and salsa are the reason we keep going to Chili's, but this time they were just soggy and greasy and almost rubbery. The server finally brought out the guacamole just two minutes before our meals arrived. When the meals came, all of them were excellent. I was happy my fajitas were sizzling this time, because on my previous visit, they were not. We were all happy with our food, but when we finished eating, we were left to sit and wait and stare at all our dirty dishes for a very long time. We thought the server forgot about us. Finally, he looked over and realized we were waiting on him. He brought the check and didn't remove one plate. Luckily, his co-worker came over and cleared them. It took several more minutes to get my credit card slip to sign. It was just a train wreck. Best way to describe it. Chili's brand is good. The chips and salsa are usually great. Not this time. And bad service to boot left us saying, not again, not anytime soon. Boo.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oviedo?start=40,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152

41,Randolph B.,"Oviedo, FL",0,13,,1.0,2014-06-22,"OMG, what was I thinking? Years ago I tried a Chili's and decided to not come back, why did I change my mind? This place was so bad I created a Yelp account just to review it. The floors were FILTHY. It was disgusting. Half the empty tables were greasy and dirty and still had pieces of food from the last diners on them. I ordered the so-called famous baby back ribs, the wife got some sort of tacos. The ribs- how to describe? They were so small I wondered if they had been cut from a small dog or perhaps cat. They tasted like they were frozen, shoved into a microwave and had BBQ sauce dumped on them. Only after I tasted them was I glad at how small they were. The fries were average at best. The water tasted like chlorine. The tacos were tiny, and the rice served with them wasn't even a Mexican rice. It was a rice pilaf that was buttered. WTF? Nasty. It took a long time to even get this food. I can't imagine why it takes so long to throw together microwave food. Its a shame the Del Taco acrossed the street a ways went out of business, they had far better food and a cleaner dining room. The portions were so small we left feeling like we had ordered appetizers. Clearly, Oviedo has been over-run by idiots given the number of people who think this place has good food. Its a shame they wasted the celery field that used to be here to build this place. This is Mexican food for people who have never had any other Mexican food than Swanson's frozen dinners.

Gone are the old baskets with a heaping helping of fries. They've been replaced by the ""upscale"" square or rectangular plates and a small handful of fries. I complained on Facebook and was rewarded with two $5 gift certificates and a handful of abusive comments from other users. I went back and decided to play it safe with a basket of tostada chips. They can't screw up chips, right? Well... I hate to be repetitive but the chips were (surprise) GREASY! Oily, soggy chips are just yuck. I did not complain since I figured it was a lost cause.

46,Greg F.,"Winter Park, FL",1,7,,1.0,2014-10-18,"Stopped by the Chili's in Oviedo. All I was getting was a margarita, some chips and salsa and an app. It took about 10 minutes before the waiter came over, and another 10 before he brought me four drinks instead of two, apparently it was my fault because he told me next time I should make it clear. I ordered one rocks one frozen and was by myself. He kept four on my bill. He also left me napkins, I picked one up, it had a blood stain on it, the food runner took that away for me.  My girlfriend arrived and asked for chips, he told her they were out and it would be another 15 minutes.  At about 35 minutes he finally brought me chips and salsa. We ate some, decided on what we wanted, ordered that and asked for more chips as the ones he gave us were greasy. They were out of chips again. It was broken to us with a nice 'yeah we're out' as he walked away. Finally got my app, triple dipper, and ordered more drinks, one and one. The boneless wings were burnt dry. He brought me new wings and again twice my drink order.  The manager brought over the right drinks, I told him about the problems, he said he was sorry about all the problems and would take care of it by not making me pay for the drinks I didn't order that were still on my bill. So basically a crappy time at Chili's tonight. Only took an hour and a half for some margaritas, greasy chips, and burnt wings. I liked going to Chili's, getting a drink and some chips and going home. This chilis has gone downhill fast over the past couple months. I don't think they get that there are problems. The last time we were there she sat in the bar with chips waiting on me. I got there with the kids and we moved to a table. The same waiter came to our table in the restaurant to tell her she was getting charged for chips she ate in the bar area now that she left.

The wait time for our food was just ridiculous, we didn't order anything that would require 45+min to cook (simple burger, tilapia and 2 kids chickens). Our server was also no very attentive. Asked him to refill my drink, he left, came back 10 min later and asked if I wanted a refill... um, yes! I asked 10 min ago! My husband's order was missing things when it finally came out, as well. The manager was nice and reduced our bill but we would have much preferred better service and paid full price.

Now for the food.  After a while our food arrives.  I guess I'm the critical one.  I ordered their $20.00 dinner for two.  My wife had quesadillas and I had the BBQ ribs with smoked potatoes (that's another story). My ribs came out dry, slathered with BBQ sauce on one side in hopes that it would make them tender.  Didn't work.    Back to the potatoes.  They were served in a little fry pan, also dried out. It's a shame because the drinks were good, but the food was pushed out without any concern for quality.  If the restaurant is busy, that is not my problem.

If you want to show me what's in the burger please do NOT pick up my food with your bare hands, that's gross. I'm so disgusted.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oviedo,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36
14,Karen S.,"Casselberry, FL",2,74,23.0,4.0,2017-01-14,We used to go to Chilis all the time and stopped going because it was so loud. So with this latest offer of three great items for 10 dollars we decided to give them another try. As soon as we walked in it was still so very loud. I'm not sure what it is about the restaurant and why it's so loud and that parents don't control their screaming kids in beyond belief. But our food and the advertised offer was great. Our waiter was very good for as busy as it was. We enjoyed the food and had more than enough. Great fajitas and the chocolate molten cake is amazing. Next time it's a to go order as it's just too loud to have a conversation inside.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oviedo,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48

1,Sherry B.,"Oviedo, Orlando, FL",104,174,147.0,2.0,2017-03-04,"Let's face it, Chili's is Chili's, am I right? I don't come here having high expectations for food, and believe me, they don't deliver either. The food is inconsistent, nothing comes close to good for you, the broccoli is microwaved, the fried pickles make me sad.....I mean, it's just all over the place. It's not a total loss though. They have drink specials, there is a game console on the table for parents who would like to keep their phones in-hand for a change, and the menu is crazy adaptable to whatever combination of foods you're looking to eat. Maybe *too* adaptable, even. There are so many combos! It's bananas. I will also say this location has excellent service, despite presumed staffing issues preventing keeping tables from staying filled during busy times. They have some situation where you can put yourself in the queue to be seated before you get to the restaurant, which is probably a good idea if you're ""planning"" to go to Chili's, which we never are. It's a fine weekday place to take the family for dinner when no one has it in them to cook dinner. It's a bit sad for the vegetarians/vegans, but not impossible to make do.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oviedo,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32

5,Dagwood S.,"Tampa, FL",31,25,,1.0,2017-03-22,"Today my family spent our very last dollar and lunch at this Chili's location.   Not only was every meal so bad and prepared poorly but it also made our children sick after the meal.     The staff is also clueless about how to serve food and wait on customers. One occasion the waitress was sweeping under every chair in our section next to us and DRAGGING each chair across the floor so loudly we could  not even hear ourselves talk.  We asked her to stop and she had a look of dismay on her face.    We are a family of 4 and know that Chili's is not a fine dinning experience but their food, staff and managers need to go back to training school and figure out why their reviews are so bad at this location.   Sorry Chili's we can't give you our business again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oviedo,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32

9,Ca C.,"Oviedo, FL",0,2,2.0,2.0,2017-04-09,"Ate there yesterday - 4 Apr 2017.  Loud and crowded as always.  But that's a good thing for the restaurant, right?  Means they're doing something right, correct? Getting food was slow, as usual.  We have waited an hour to get a 4-person meal before.  This time it was over 30 minutes (after ordering) get soup, salad, mac, and queso for 4 people.  The table next to us was seated, ate, paid, and left before we were even served. The food had obviously been overlooked under a heat lamp.  The cold salad came out on hot plates and the cheese was melting.  Supposed to be a simple, cold, house salad. The server was polite though not warm or friendly.  Just busy. And then we got hit with the $2 Entertainment Charge.  I asked what this was and they said it was for playing with the Ziosk (tablet).  I said I never touched it.  They asked if my child did.  I said probably and that they could charge him if they wanted to.  He gets about a dollar a week for allowance when he's behaving.  The waitress wasn't happy.  I asked her when Chili's received my consent to charge me for playing a game.  She said my child must've given consent (""clicked the OK button"").  I asked her if children are allowed to enter into contractual agreements.  She had the charge removed. What a scam.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oviedo,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44

Not sure if they were susposed to be or not. I would have preferred them hot.  The Texas cheese fries were awesome!!

6,Kelsey W.,"Oviedo, FL",0,1,,1.0,2017-11-04,"First off I want to say is I love Chili's. The food, drinks and atmosphere is amazing. Everything always tastes great and the drinks are delicious. However, I ordered from Chili's take out one day and not only got the complete wrong order which was someone else's order, when I came back inside to pick up what was my actual order (was waiting on the big mouth bites that I didn't get at first, they also took the extra egg rolls that they accidentally gave us which is not ethically allowed to bring back in the kitchen seeing as it went outside of the doors) I saw someone in the back pick up the closest thing to them that were unfinished and very cold burger bites instead of freshly cooking what we had originally had ordered. We would have gladly waited the extra time for it to be remade. I am just very disappointed at my experience with Chili's take out service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oviedo,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
