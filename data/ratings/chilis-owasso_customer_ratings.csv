2,Drew B.,"Owasso, OK",107,329,28,2.0,2014-09-02,"It's not horrible, but it's not awesome either. When I moved to Owasso 10 years ago this was probably the best option in town. With the new competition around it is easy to pass this place up. We went for a late dinner on Saturday. Plenty of room in the dining area. The bar was more packed and seemed to be lively. The place was clean, the servers were nice. The food was just OK. Prices are ok, service is fine. Nothing interesting. I'd go back, but only if it was someone else's decision.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-owasso,,,,,
3,John H.,"Los Angeles, CA",13,5,4,4.0,2015-02-08,"The food's not bad, the service isn't bad either. The water tasted kinda ick, but that's to be expected in the city I guess. Good shrimp and meat. Good shrimp but they only have two flavor options... Overall a good place to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-owasso,,,,,
4,Steve S.,"Fort Worth, TX",3,36,4,4.0,2015-03-16,Pretty good soup and Chili. The hot sauce and chips are great. Get the bottomless soup. That's the best. Service is great and the people are nice. Give them a shot.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-owasso,,,,,
5,Ryan F.,"Pittsburg, KS",3,20,8,4.0,2015-04-07,"Great service. Server named Cecelia, hope that's how it's spelled. She was very kind, sweet, attentive, good memory no need for pad for order. Other than that food was great kind of wish I knew mac and cheese came with jalapeños in it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-owasso,,,,,
1,Travis Q.,"Tulsa, OK",28,83,7,2.0,2016-03-16,"Not bad but not great.  Can't order ala cart from the kids menu which is a real pain. We talked with the manager, and while I feel he had it in his power to allow this, he did not make any concessions for us. So for a 1 year old who doesn't like eating baby food, we had to order a full kids meal...which obviously is way too much food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-owasso,,,,,
0,Steve H.,"Owasso, OK",63,100,26,4.0,2017-07-16,I hadn't been to a Chilis in a while so I was interested to see the menu had evolved somewhat with new choices. There is a pretty broad selection of food from Tex-Mex to steaks and more traditional American foods. We ordered burgers. M got the traditional and I ordered the sunrise burger. The sunrise was great. Full of flavor and huge. I especially liked the pickles they put on it. They are different than the run of the mill pickles.  A piece of the hamburger broke off and I picked it up and ate it separately. It was really good meat.  I'm not a big fan of the fries. Nothing special about them.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-owasso,,,,,
