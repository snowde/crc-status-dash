87,Erica R.,"Oxnard, CA",15,95,1.0,3.0,2012-02-19,"After seeing a commercial for Chili's $20 for 2 for an appetizer and two entrees, my boyfriend and I decided to try out Chili's.  We had a ten to fifteen minute wait before we were seated and then our drink orders were taken. We looked through the menu, choose our food, and closed our menus.  Our drinks came, then we waited with our menus closed - and then waited for a waiter to come by to take our order.  Nearly ten minutes passed by.  Finally, an unhappy looking waiter came by to take our orders, barely looking at us.  Luckily, once our order was in, we didn't have to wait long for the food. For our appetizer, we had the onion rings.  I'm not a big fan of onion rings in general, but my boyfriend enjoyed then.  My boyfriend ordered the sirlion steak, which was tender and well seasoned.  I'm not a big red meat eater and I was enjoying the deliciousness of the meat.  I ordered the chicken fajitas, which came out pipping hot on a hot plate.  The chicken was not seasoned and quite bland, but with the toppings included (i.e. cheese, sour cream, guacomole, lettuce, tomatoes, onions) was edible.   I believe that, given the choices on the menu for the $20 for 2 deal, the place is worth trying again.  I may even go for a sirlion steak this time.  That's why the food deserves a star rating.  However, the service deserves two starts.  A long wait time and unfriendly waiter made the experience unpleasant.  Isn't that a big reason why someone goes to a restaurant anyway? Oh yeah, and Chili's does serve actual chili for all you curious people out there!  :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oxnard?start=80,2.508,2.508,2.508,2.508,2.508
94,Matthew D.,"Ventura, CA",77,16,9.0,4.0,2012-02-24,"Chili's is a little too pricey for my blood. But, I guess that's the ""persona"" they've taken on over the years. Besides the price, the drink was stiff and the appetizer's were appetizing. I recommend the cheese & meat skillet. I had the Chicken sandwich that's supposed to be smothered in hot wing sauce, but they were rather skimpish with that. And that took FOREVER to come out.

Maybe Chli's couldn't handle the overflow. Our food took forever, but I think it took just as long to get the check paid. It was horrible. I give two stars because the food was good. If you are on a time crunch, stay away. The last three times service was slow.  This by far has been the worst.

115,Paulie G.,"Oxnard, CA",0,65,,1.0,2012-05-12,"Please bear w/ me as I'm very analytical and believe that limited detail might not suffice. I had a rather multitude of problems last night at this location. Similarly, my guest and I were quite perplexed how things were handled as well. Quick version (store #588) turned into a business training and an unsolicited scolding from your Manager Julie Carpenter. In the beginning,  I clearly and politely told bartender Danielle, when we ordered, ""that I was not in a rush""! Drinks were fine...appetizers fine....yet meals were delivered way too fast! I felt pressured to finish the appetizers, so this is not good service attention to detail. Danielle removed my plate then both servers ignored us for a good 20 minutes. I had pushed the appetizer plate forward, showing we were finished, and then watched the poor service prevail. Both servers passed by multiple times...yet couldn't comprehend my dinner was waiting. Similarly that my guest was barely eating...as she was waiting for my dinner to arrive. When Danielle finally and disinterestedly showed up...I explained to her the problems. I was never vulgar....rude....or abrasive...thought provoking...YES!!! I'm there as the customer and shouldn't have to ask her to serve me...this is what I said. From that moment on...we were the plague.  Manager (Julie Carpenter) approached us in a very abrasive fashion and barked at me (paraphrasing) ""what did you do/say to my server? She's in the backroom crying?"" This was 25 minutes after the initial conflict. I spoke to Julie for probably 20-25 minutes....as she was QUITE accusational and said ""I'm the Mother here and those are my girls!!!!"" Why does this matter? There was so many comments that were exchanged during this session..I just can't type them all out! Julie remained very accusational...seemed more concerned w/ how hew staff's feelings were tarnished...and wasn't very concerned w/ me writing a negative review!  Later when asked for Julie to return...she refused. Both bartenders ignored us til later...and were in close proximity probably 20 times+++ 2nd bartender Erica thought they were giving us '10 out of 10' service??? Now... after a 20 minute session w/ their manager....mind you filling up waters and asking for another drink or napkin was like a root canal...I merely chimed in and said, ' more like a negative 5.' Sooooooo.....glutton for punishment....we stayed and did something unmentionable....ORDERED ANOTHER DRINK!!! Erica heard our version....made a decent attempt to counter the bad taste....and we closed up our tab. Erica said that Julie would NOT come out for 2nd visit....seemingly odd? And left over a 20% tip after being scolded and ignored....? Not to be discarded, but definitely a valid point, we watched half of the kitchen crew and bartenders remain in the backroom for over 5 minutes. Consoling an upset worker this way does what.....IGNORES YOUR CUSTOMERS!!! Especially when an opportunity to 'make things right' was suggested by me!!! So....I'm a HUGE fan of poor/indifferent service given by staff that exercises bad choices deserves retribution! The pen IS mightier at this point...and I think this establishment STILL doesn't understand what they did wrong and take the ownership for their errors!!! With that....I'd say a revenue loss of $300+ per month might make my review scar! This is what the service world has come to... get mad at your patrons when they complain....and seek false & gravely invalid comfort from your co-workers...who coincidentally deliver that same inferior service and attitude....sad sad sad!  Sometimes the real challenge is to make a bad service situation turn into a 'lifetime' customer....once Chili's Supervisors figure this out...please contact me!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-oxnard?start=100,2.244,2.244,2.244,2.244,2.2440000000000007

I would give it 5 stars if the service wasn't so iffy. It's 50/50 whether or not you will get a good waiter/waitress. Some times they have attitudes, ignore you table, take 20+ minutes to run your bill, but overall that's expected at a low end restaurant like this.

Where is the seating rotation ?? The service was very slow. We ordered 15 minutes into being sat. We watched as the other tables that came in after us ordered their food and then received their food before us. Not to mention our server forgot one of the side dishes we ordered. We had to leave before we got to even start eating due to an emergency and I will say the staff was really quick with getting us our to-go boxes and our check. Because we had to leave so fast we did not review the bill and completely forgot out the Mac n cheese we ordered that we never got.

My 5 year old got his French Fry's as we were leaving, unacceptable! Oh and to those that will say ""he doesn't know what it's like to be a waiter"" I was for ten years and never gave service this bad, he made us reach for our plates, and I had to help him with taking the kids milks out his hand because the other was full!? Rookie? Maybe I'm being harsh, but would have loved to give him a 5 min crash course on how to make good money as waiter. It's really easy, your customers should never need anything, think ahead and give them your undivided attention. Don't try to take there order by memory then ask them to repeat it as you write it down, (yeah he did). I have a 3 strikes rule and that's strike 2 at this Chilli's. Probably my last time there.

My husband ordered the ribeye.  I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich.  At this point my husband ordered the patron margarita.   The manager brought out our appetizer.  Which was good.  I think it was the best part of the whole meal.  Another lady brought out our entrees and my husbands patron margarita.  My food wasn't good nor bad.  Just an average buffalo chicken sandwich. My husbands food on the other hand was no where near edible.  The steak was so incredibly salty.  Another patron to the side of us ordered the same thing and also had the same complaint.  The broccoli was bland.  The best thing on his plate was the potatoes.  He only ate about 1/3 of his meal. His margarita was also watered down just like my daiquiri.   We only saw our server when the order was placed, to bring out our drinks, right before she dropped the check to ask if we needed a box to which my husbands response was ""it wasn't worth it"" and when she dropped off the check.  And she didn't even bother coming all the way around the corner to do so. This was the last straw.  So we asked to speak to the manager. He didn't apologize or even acknowledge the lousy service or food.  He just comped the appetizer and went on about his way.  He wasn't very friendly either.  You can tell why the service sucked, it trickles down from the top.

The kiosk which they call ""ziosk"" allow you to order appetizers, reorder drinks, pay the bill, calculate tips for you, prints the receipt, offers unlimited games for 99c (bejeweled, fruit ninja, etc). Very fancy all together! In terms of food, I almost never stray from the unlimited soup and salad they have. During lunch 12-4pm, it's about 8 bucks but on weekends it's 10 bucks. One soup cup is 3ish and one bowl is 5 so prob worth it if you have an endless appetite for soups like me! My favorite is the chicken enchilada soup which comes with a lot of white chicken meat drenched Ina creamy sauce and shredded cheese (once again, not exactly wedding food diet)  My fiancé tried their trio fajita plate which came with chicken, steak, and shrimp on a sizzling plate. These also sound a tom better than they taste not that they don't taste good but damn that sizzling sound! Deceiving as heck!

She took other peoples orderes and what really pissed me off was that a family that came in after us got there drinks faster and they got there chips before us. So 20 mins passed nnd we finally called her over and told her we r ready to order. Once we finished ordering. My husband asked were are our chips. She says oh i forgot.

Meal for two for $20.00 is a great deal,  Go to TGIF and you will  not find anything similar.  I also like the way they honor veterans, with their 10% discount.   Sure, waiting time is long, but only on certain days like weekends.  But try going to other place and you will realize that this is nothing abnormal for that day and time.  On a normal day, there is almost no waiting at all. Waitpersons are actually friendly and will assist you with whatever you need, just ask!

Music was very loud and with people trying to talk loud to be heard, it was not a pleasant surroundings. The waitress took our order, and while waiting, we played with an IPad looking gizmo that each table had. You can look up menu, pay bills and play games on it while waiting for the food. There was a family next to us and someone there had a birthday. The staff came over and sang a very loud song. Not the usual BD song. They were so loud that a young boy at that table got scared and started to cry. Anyhow the waitress bought wine for my wife and coffee for me. Later the Santa Fe chicken salad arrived. It was spicy, but good.  However, the waitress never came back to refill my coffee, or ask if everything was ok. I had no water either. I ate my meal and waited while burning to see if anything was going to change. It did not. When we got the bill, we had two extra charges on our bill. One was for $0.99 for the game we played on the ""gizmo"". We missed a small print that said there is a charge. We also had a $7 and change charge for something  that we had not ordered.

Remembering how it was back then, it's nice because the food quality and overall vibe it's still very much the same as before as if they've stayed consistent and have even gotten better by adding on better and move food options. Although being corporate, Chilis has many options to satisfy the enchilada lover to the steak lover. I was surprised on my last visit at how many options they have added, that aren't necessarily the traditional dishes they are known for.  Chilis has a wonderful happy hour menu, so if you're thinking of a fun place for HH, Chilis is the place for you. They have new appetizers (please refer to my pics) that are always changing. I loved the loaded fries add steak, delicious! My hubs and I order a few rounds of their signature margarita; mine extra, extra spicy of course. The prime rib meat option for the fajitas was not thaaaaat great, if anything the meat was dry. On the other hand, the shrimp was juicy and had flavor. I'd have to say that the boneless loaded chicken appetizer was delicious, and not what they traditionally offer at Chilis, try it!  The service here is pretty standard. The servers provide just the right amount of customer service without being overly phony, that's nice.

So we tell them and they apologize, take it away and start on our new order. I got a bacon burger and that came with my husbands incorrect ribs. It was not great. The burger was dry and the fries were cold.  My husbands steak came as I finished my burger and it STILL has rice on the plate. At that point he was too hungry to care.

It was really nonappetizing. We only ate a few pieces and had to leave the rest. The mini salad also tasted like it's been sitting in the fridge. The cucumbers wete half frozen.  The ribs barely had any meat on the bone. They didn't bring any wet wipes with the ribs so we asked one but the wipes didn't come to us until 10 minutes after we were done eating.

Never even mentioned a price or t. Received bill...my like 6$ salad became a TWELVE DOLLAR SALAD. I was up charged almost 6 dollars for chicken!!! 6$!? I would hope that the sever would have had the decency or TRAINING to inform customers about pricing options when they ask for something different than what was posted. A side house salad for near 12 dollars!? With that surprise coming only when going to pay the tab....ridiculous! ! I would have NOT asked for chicken , or ordered something else. Heck, I would've took a paired down size of chicken.  Was the salad good? Yes. I had no complaints.
