He finally came around and said oh I was suppose to get you your drink huh?  Frickin duh... come on, do your flippin job not flirt all night buddy.  I hope Chili's gets there crap together because I won't be going back there for awhile.  Dear lord,  please don't let Chili's 30 year old waiters hit on my teenage daughter if she goes there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-parker-2?start=20,2.148,2.148,2.148,2.148,2.148

55,Jeremy R.,"Aurora, CO",31,15,8.0,4.0,2013-01-23,I know it's corporate food but I still enjoy Chili's every once in a while. The chips and salsa alone are worth the trip. It probably only gets a 4 star rating from me because of nostalgia (I ate there all the time in college and high school) but I do enjoy a lot of their food. The chicken enchilada soup is great for lunch. I also like the Bacon Ranch Chicken Quesadillas. I haven't had a burger there in forever (there are better places to go for a burger). My wife also loves the Quesadilla Explosion Salad. Service is usually pretty good too. Always fast and friendly.

Most items on their menus are well over 3000 mg of sodium per serving, and some come in at over 5000 mg. Disappointing, since I have to keep my sodium to 2000 mg per DAY for a healthy lifestyle.

The floor was dirty,  the bathroom was super dark (even the staff agreed as I walked out, I commented, they said- I know you can't see anything!) and dirty, no paper towels to dry hands.. The bartender was putting glasses away and the ""clinking"" was so loud I was sure some were chipping. We asked why he didn't have a bar-back to help, he said he refused to have anyone back there as he wanted the tips. The tv was on to a country top 20 station and the commercials were loud, there was a baseball game on another channel, why was that not on the speakers? .. An elderly gentlemen stayed even shorter time than we did, It was a bizarre experience. I've been going to Chili's since Tamarac Square, and we love the one in Southlands.  HUGE kudos to Darlene the bartender at Southlands Chili's.

Our waitress came over within a few minutes and took our drinks order she was very patient with us while we looked over the menu and decided what we wanted to eat in between chatting.

Our waitress did great about keeping our drinks topped up and checking in with us without been in our face which I liked.  I just want to note that I never eat at our local chillis in Albuquerque due to bad experiences but that's for another review- so my expectations were low however I expect high standards and am not necessarily easily pleased but I had no complaints with this chillis.  The only reason I knocked off a star is because the entire time we were there the tables seemed to be full of plates I understand they was busy and like I mentioned we didn't mind clearing off our own table however there clearly needs to be something done about that.

10,Patrick W.,"Castle Rock, CO",11,23,47.0,2.0,2016-09-22,"Don't where to start but here goes. The service was ok but, I feel the staff need training. I ordered fajitas, steak chicken, and shrimp. The taste was subpar and the shrimp looked nothing like it the shrimp that is displayed in the menu. The steak tasted like nothing, no flavor just warm meat. The chicken didn't get any better. Looked like the cook seasoned it wth Lawry's season salt on the way out to are table. The kids seemed to enjoy what they ate, but what do they know they are only kids eating a meal paid by Dad. Ordered corn tortillas for my tasteless fajitas but the waitress brought bus flour. When I informed her of the mistake she came back with raw corn tortillas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-parker-2,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
12,Diane C.,"Parker, CO",27,8,10.0,4.0,2016-12-23,We enjoy munching on the chips and salsa. I always say I'm going to get the molten cake and end up too stuffed to eat.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-parker-2,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68
14,D R.,"Aurora, CO",27,15,3.0,1.0,2016-12-26,"Wish they had a no star button!!!10 minutes to have a waitress offer us drinks. They dropped us kid menus for our kids with no crayons. We ordered some adult drinks, skillet queso, and the kids food first. They brought the kids drinks fairly quick and we ordered our entrees. About another 10 minutes to get out drinks. The kids were served shortly after, then they finally brought our appetizer. The chips looked like the bottom of the bag mostly broken crumbs. We blazed through the chips pretty fast, we were starving. No on came by to check on us or refill our waters and chips. About another 30 minutes goes by with no entrees. I lost it, flagged another waitress down and asked her to find our server to bring us our bill. She came over and didn't apologize for our issue. She said ""I hope everything was good"". Uh yeah, we never got our food! Maybe if you checked in on us things would have got expedited! She then offered to take our entrees off or get them to go. Yeah, I had enough! Besides how could she take them off? They weren't on our bill. I think maybe she didn't ring them in. Either way kids were satisfied, drinks were ok, chips sucked,queso was ok. I wish a manger had come by. Oh almost forgot how filthy the floor was where we sat. I am sure a family with small kids were there before us. Crap everywhere! I used my foot as a broom so I wouldn't need to step in it. This probably goes down in my top 5 worst restaurant experience in my 40+ years of life. No way I will ever come close to this place or ever recommend this place. I would rather tell all my friends and family to avoid this place like the plague. As far as Chilis goes, maybe I will try another location. I will be extremely cautious. Thank GOD for Freddys Steakburgers drive thru. We got to eat after all!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-parker-2,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
1,Vanessa C.,"Lone Tree, CO",76,83,229.0,4.0,2017-02-08,"Previous reviews made me wary to try this Chili's location. However, I feel like most franchise/chain restaurants receive more negative reviews than locals.. Expecting the worse, we walked in tonight for a quick dessert. We were in and out within 20 minutes, or less. It wasn't empty nor was it jam-packed. It seemed like the right amount of people dining inside for a Wednesday night. I was awaiting sticky tables and menus plus dirty floors, as I've experienced those standards in many Chili's locations (in South Florida. This is only my second Colorado). The opposite occurred, sticky-free tables and menus and nearly spotless floors, from where we were seated, near the entryway. Once our waitress (I wish we knew her name!) swiftly arrived to our table, she greeted us with a big smile and proceeded to asking for our dessert order. We ordered only two things. A regular molten lava cake and a caramel molten lave cake. Both were larger than I remembered from my past lava cakes. All so moist and delicious. A few pieces of the scooped ice creams did have tiny chunks of ice, freezer burn? Nothing to complain about. I anticipated the worst but was surprisingly very cheerful of our short experience here tonight. Only four stars because it wouldn't seem fair to give five stars if we didn't try the actual food on the main menus. Maybe next time. However, I did see an awesome but temporary deal for a 3-course meal for $10, which included a select appetizer, select entree, and select mini dessert. You can also upgrade the dessert to full size for $2 more! Thanks Chili's of Parker, CO! For the sweet evening.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-parker-2,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64

First of all let me say that the service I experienced at Chilis was good. Our server was on top of it, quick, efficient, and very courteous.  So what's the problem?  The food.  My wife and I started going to Chili's a LONGGGGGG time ago. Back then they made their own fries had just a few burger, ribs and the best chicken tacos ever! Now the food is so process and just not very good.  The salads came with the weeds mix, can't order it with ""hold the weeds"".  My burger came out the lettuce was all wilted and hot from sitting under the heat lamps and burger as thin as McD's. It makes me very sad to see whet this once great chain has become :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-parker-2,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
2,Andrea M.,"Southeast, Denver, CO",2,18,13.0,1.0,2017-06-28,"Gave Chilis one last try tonight and they failed again. Over charged for a happy hour beer in the bar and the manager actually argued with me over it.  Sorry waitress, but your manager owes ya some money. This Chilis doesn't know the difference between local craft beer and domestic beer. We're in Colorado, local craft is brewed in Colorado, not California.  Will never go back to Chilis. Horrible customer service by the manager.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-parker-2,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48

We where sat promptly and greated by our waitresses quickly. I ordered the chipotle chicken and waffles, let me tell you this was one of the most satisfying meals I have had in a long time. This was my first time eating chicken and waffles but man what have I been missing out on. We never ran out of drinks and we are getting use to paying on the machine (even though I don't like them at all) so we left quickly. I can't wait to have more chicken and waffles.

6,Steve T.,"Denver, CO",2,14,1.0,2.0,2017-07-28,Why do we come back here? This has to be the slowest Chili's in the country. A good 30 minutes to get our food.

9,Christy S.,"Parker, CO",0,15,,1.0,2017-10-08,"Ordered our favorite chips and salsa. The salsa was good. The chips were overcooked, tasted like they were fried in old oil, stale and not served warm like they usually are. We told the waitress and she brought us another order that was the same and said, ""that's just how they are"". They didn't try to cook a fresh batch or figure out what the problem was. Then our fajitas arrived. They were not sizzling, like usual. The steak was flavorless and barely warm. The shrimp were tiny excuses for what I would get at any restaurant that would served grilled shrimp fajitas. The fajita veggies were not seasoned or cooked, just looked like they put raw onions and peppers on the fajita plate before they added the meats. Before we left, we saw other tables served chips that looked much better that what we were served. Apparently, they wanted to finish the old batch on us. The whole meal was very disappointing. Service was lacking any enthusiasm or interest in ensuring a good meal. Why would we go back? In the past, the Chili's manager would visit tables to ask if your meal was good. This didn't happen. I suppose they already know the answer and don't want to hear the negative feedback. $45 wasted on this meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-parker-2,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28

7,Maura L.,"Parker, CO",0,3,2.0,1.0,2017-10-22,"Super sup par service. We waited a while once we were seated to even be greeted by our server. We had both kids with us on a Sunday evening when the restaurant was not busy. We ordered everything at once- the kids were already tired of waiting and were hungry. Didn't get drinks for a very long time. When she came w drinks she asked us if we were ready to ordered-- but we had already ordered. She gave us two straws- there were four of us. We had no napkins and only two forks. My husband didn't get his beer, she never came back w it. We got up and found our own straws. Then when our 2 year old spilled his milk we found our own napkins too. The food was brought out- the wrong meal for our kids so it had to go back. My husband got steak, I got a chicken bowl. We had no proper silverware and so he went to the entrance of the kitchen to get a knife, which we shared. She talked up adding sour cream and guacamole on my bowl and only sour cream came. At that point I thought oh well. We asked another server for my husband's beer and he got it from the bar. The food was fine, typical Chili's.  But what I think is super tacky is that when my husband was paying she asked to take the kiosk from him. Doesn't it stay at the table?? He intended to take the survey. She STAYED at our table and slowed cleared the table within eyesight of the screen while he waited for her to leave. When he told her he wasn't done with the kiosk she talked for a very long time about how the survey was a pass or fail thing between her and her boss. That anything less than a 5 was a fail. Then she said ""I know it's a Friday and I'm loopy"" (it was SUNDAY-- weird) And ""let's all be nice to each other and if it isn't a 5 then just don't do the survey.""  Sooo tacky!!! What's the point of having a survey then?! But what made us even more mad-- the chili's survey timed out in the time she lingered so that when she left, it was no longer available. Of course. My husband had answered 2 questions before she came but we doubt it counted since he didn't complete it.  Come on, Chili's!! Your server had no reason to have acted this way. One or two mistakes are fine; we understand. But there were so many and the end was completely unprofessional.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-parker-2,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24
