18,Cookie D.,"Pasadena, TX",0,6,,2.0,2013-05-09,Wait staff good burgers not so much got a cheese burger for my daughter it was so over cooked and black around the edges that when it came and I saw how burnt it was I instantly asked her if she wanted catsup on it but she still ended up just eating the bread and the middle of the patty. After the first bite she asked her brother to trade half of his chicken sandwich that was cooked ok for half of her burger he did but he didn't eat the burger except for a couple of bites. I got the new guacamole burger also black around the edges and dry with burnt almost unrecognizable onions solid black I got a cup of enchilada soup it was good. Kids also thought the broccoli and corn was good,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pasadena?start=20,2.088,2.088,2.088,2.088,2.088
15,Dylan H.,"Dickinson, TX",53,234,23.0,2.0,2013-09-10,"Upon entering I was assaulted by the scent of mold, but the smell diminished as I was let to a booth.   The chicken was good, but room temperature, and the southwestern egg rolls tasted...odd.  I wish I had a better term.  Slimy, maybe?  Definitely not what you'd expect of a classic Chili's appetizer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pasadena?start=20,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.12

We get the 2 for 20, mainly because they get the steak done properly. We tried their new Cinnamon Molten Cake.. THIS IS TO DIE FOR!! Great cinnamon taste, the right amount of texture without being too gooey. Will definately order this again. we did split it three way. It is big, but really for two to share.

12,Allie H.,"Pasadena, TX",0,5,,2.0,2014-08-08,"Don't even know why I'm giving them 2 stars. We have been a couple of times. Before the remodel, service was awful. Did not get drinks for at least 10 minutes, food took way too long and came out cold. After remodel, we thought we'd give them another shot. It was worse. Took over 25 minutes (no, I'm not exaggerating) for the waiter to greet us AFTER we were sat. Food came out wrong. And they tried to charge us for playing games on the tablet at the table while we waited so long for a waiter! Talked to the manager and he was very disconcerned and made it seem like we were bothering him. Shame because I've always loved chili's. Won't be going to this one again",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pasadena?start=20,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000002,1.9920000000000004

39,Ronnie M.,"Pasadena, TX",39,80,4.0,2.0,2014-11-21,"Remodel is great looking, as is the concept behind the revamped menu. The execution is just blah. The service was slow and inattentive and the food was bland.  Price makes total sense though.

4,German A.,"Houston, TX",99,48,5.0,1.0,2015-02-22,"We got there Friday at 7pm, party of 7. We're told we'd have to wait 15 to 20 minutes for a table. There was a rockets game barely starting on the tv. After waiting for 45 minutes, we check with hostess what's taking so long. She skipped us and we were not on the list she was looking at. Awesome.  We finally got sat and waitress took our drinks. Ordered some appetizers since we were hungry.  20 minutes and we get our drinks. We order appetizers and food. Appetizers take another 30 minutes. Waitress dissapears. No refills, no food. We've been here more than 2  hours. The rockets game is now OVER. Done. We won. Yey. Good job rockets. Still no food. The chips for the appetizer were soo salty. Like, i thought Ashton kutcher was going to come out and tell us we got punkd. Ashton never showed. The salt showed up. Salt with chips dusted on is a more accurate assessment of the situation. We start a conversation about possibly going to get food at jack in the box, because were so hungry. We made a pie chart of the pros and cons. We discuss it as a committee. Majority rules apply, and 2 people said wait 15 more minutes. So we wait. No food. We reopen the case to go somewhere else. This time, we present a persuasive speech to the jury. We decide to go. We look for our waitress to get the bill. She's still missing. Someone should have called an amber alert for that waitress. That's how missing she was. We walk to the front, tell the hostess to get the manager. Takes 5 minutes for the manager to walk out. Waitress still no where. Bus boys come to the table we were at and cleaned it. Still nobody. No food visible. It was about to be 3 hours later, and we tell the manager were leaving, out of courtesy. No dine and dash, we ask for a receipt. He says ""are y'all just gonna leave?"" ""Yes. There's no food. We're hungry."" ""...okay"" and just stares at us. We turn and leave. Hostess is all like ""have a good night!"" I laughed out loud ""she said have a good night""  I will never go to Pasadena ever again. Not chilis, the entire city. It was just a Friday. We got quicker service valentines day at Olive Garden with a 2 hour wait time to be seated.  Horrible service. Wish I could tell you about the food, but we never got any. The tv that shows the basketball games works. You can watch an entire game on it. I can vouche for that. The soda was delicious. It was a coca cola.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pasadena?start=20,1.956,1.956,1.956,1.956,1.956
6,Q R.,"Houston, TX",288,7,2.0,1.0,2015-03-12,Not enough servers during lunch.

Although three of the waitresses saw us waiting, they avoided us. In fact, one of those waitresses came storming out with food in her mouth to take a parties' order.

13,Krystal D.,"Houston, TX",0,3,,1.0,2015-08-02,"The service at the Pasadena, TX location seems to be consistently horrible. My husband and I tried going back for lunch this afternoon after having two previous encounters. Service was horrible, took about 5 minutes to be greeted. Our appetizer took a while to come out then my food was cold to the touch, literally. I sent it back then when it came back it still tasted horrible. The shrimp I ordered looked and tasted like something you'd get from Walmart. Not the quality you think you'd receive for what Chili's charges. Completely unsatisfied. I will never go back again nor will I recommend to anyone else. I'm not one to write reviews but I felt so strongly about this I just had to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pasadena?start=20,,,,,

Until I asked the hostess how much longer for our table to which she replied that we were going to have to wait for one of the tables to leave. (They were barely ordering) I pointed out the plenty empty tables in the back and she says that there were no servers back there. Ridiculous. I told her that I knew one of the servers could simply take care of us. She just said she would ask . We were seated 2 mins later. Our server was great and so was the food.

29,Grim T.,"Houston, TX",0,11,6.0,3.0,2017-03-21,"Had to give this Chili's 3-stars because of repeated horrible experiences on the restraunt side but consistent 4-star experiences on the bar side. With 4.5 star rating for the long-time, highly skilled, chaos-managing bearded bartender. Definitely grab a stool or a booth on the bar side where you are likely to catch both good service & an entertaining sporting event on one of the many TVs. Foods always good. We are fans of the 2 for $22 option. We'd embrace the 2 for $35 which includes two alcoholic beverages, if there were any options other than margaritas. Blech!

21,Emily L.,"Pasadena, TX",42,42,91.0,4.0,2017-07-29,"I go to Chili's when I can't decide what I want to eat because they have a large variety at a decent price. My husband and I came by for a quick lunch date. He had a burger from the lunch menu which came with fries and your choice of soup or salad. I got the cheese enchiladas.  The hubby LOVES burgers!! He says the burgers at Chili's are good, but he wouldn't rank them in him top burgers. They're just regular burgers. My cheese enchiladas were good. They were very cheesy and they had an ancho sauce, with cilantro rice and black beans. They were very filling, and I would get them again. Our food was served piping hot and in a timely manner. I gave four stars because the food is pretty good, and I've never had a problem with it, but there's nothing about it that's super special. I also like that I can pay at my table and not have to worry about my card be taken away by a stranger. On the other hand, there have been several times when I've had poor service.

It's consistent,  it's not the best but it's by far not the worst. They have a lot of interesting cocktails, the bar staff is friendly, the wait staff is good. To us the best part about Chili's is playing trivia at the table. That sounds funny but we really enjoy it.

The last time I ordered it, I got the following 3 appetizers: Sliders, Southwest Egg Rolls and Original Chicken Crispers. It was great! I forgot how delicious those Chicken Crispers are! They are so fluffy and crispy. Yum! My boyfriend ordered the Sirloin Steak and broccoli. He was going on and on about how good the steamed broccoli was. I'm not a broccoli fan so I don't get it. The steak he said was just OK. His daughter ordered some kind of Cajun Pasta. It looked delicious but rich. Their drinks are good too. We like the Patron margaritas. I wanted to try the Caramel Molten Cake but we were all too full. Bummer! Our server was nice and efficient. But overall this wasn't anything memorable. Chili's is one of those restaurants we hardly ever go to. It's not bad but it's nothing special.
