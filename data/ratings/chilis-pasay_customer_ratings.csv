3,Joan C.,"Manila, Philippines",39,6,136,5.0,2016-01-03,"Food is always nicely prepared. It's my 2nd chili's branch that i visitied and so far they are consistent as to friendliness, cleanliness and yumminess. One thing i noticed different is here in SM MOA branch, they have regular tables while the ones in Tomas have cutesy tiles on their tables. Food i like to order are the unlimited tostilla, burger bites, and texas cheesfries which are always mouth watering!!!  It's the first time i tried the molten chocolate cake and i can say it's definitely a must try for the sweet tooth!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pasay,,,,,
2,Glenn L.,"San Jose, CA",721,596,1712,4.0,2016-06-09,"My dad wanted to dine at Chili's after shopping at Mall Of Asia. I guess he wanted a break from all the delicious Asian foods we've been eating on our vacation. It was packed! I rarely eat at chain restaurants in California because It's usually a miss for me with the food! but the American chain restaurants entering Manila are doing it right! Friendly atmosphere, clean and inviting dining area, and of course delicious foods. Everything we ordered were really good from the appetizers to our entree!   This specific branch is located at a busy mall, so wait times can be long.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pasay,,,,,

Good drinks The LIT was made right! I tried one of the local beers call Red Horse it was pretty good. I like the service the people that worked there were super nice. The grub was average, I had a club sandwich I think there should be an international law that any sandwich that claims to have bacon should have no less than four strips on it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pasay,,,,,
0,Jay M.,"Aiea, HI",19,4,3,5.0,2017-09-27,"By far the best Chili's I have ever experienced. The staff is so friendly, the food was uniquely amazing, they have the same food as US menus but more flavorful. The bar tender Arrol was very attentive and ensured my dining experience was the best it could possibly be. Hats off to Chili's MOA!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pasay,,,,,
