23,Nancy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,80,5.0,2.0,2014-03-04,"Lousy. Yes, the waitress was in training but she goofed up 2 of 3 orders. The steaks weren't cooked right. It took a long time to get them back. The salad had the wrong dressing. The service was generally slow. Lastly, they didn't even take anything of the bill or give us anything for the problems.

It is hard to find bad service at any restaurant in the area . People are just nice in PTC. But it was HORRIBLE. The food , the service , the bar was sooooo slow.

24,Gee L.,"Odenton, MD",2,30,5.0,1.0,2015-02-01,"My date and I had lunch on Sunday and the food has really gone down hill. My date ordered the boneless chicken wings and the fajitas, the boneless wings arrived with barely enough sauce to cover them making them taste like just like plain chicken breast. The fajitas contained about 5 slices of both chicken and beef with about 8oz of vegitables. I ordered the nachos with grilled steak. The nachos I received contained beef that had a consistency of Steakums which is nothing like the grilled steak the restaurant used to serve.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peachtree-city?start=20,,,,,

18,Linda F.,"Fayetteville, GA",33,149,20.0,2.0,2015-03-19,"Not a great experience tonight. Slow to wait on from the beginning even though when we arrived it was made clear that we only had a little over an hour to dine. Waitress kept disappearing took about 20 min to place order and then 55minutes from arrival to get food ? Half our party had less than 15minutes to eat and had to run. Food was ok, just took too long. Took another 25 minute to get go boxes and go drink since no refill? If you have a couple hours to blow and don't mind uncomfortable seating then this is the place as our food was enjoyed swiftly!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peachtree-city,,,,,

19,Jack S.,"Albany, GA",99,16,3.0,3.0,2015-07-26,"Girlfriend and myself went here for lunch. We got here around 1100 in the morning. The service was average, and the food was average like all other chilies. There weren't many people in the restaurant but it still took us forever to get our food. Experience was the same you would get at any other chilis. Go to taco Mac if you have the choice",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peachtree-city,,,,,
17,Charles C.,"Newnan, GA",1,25,,1.0,2015-08-04,"We ate there Sunday August 2. The food was just average,the service (pardon my language) sucked. The menu has been changed and some of my favorite menu items were gone waitress said what I ask for had been deleted in the past few months. I am from Newnan and always liked Chillis ours went out of business but just before it went out we experienced poor service and average food was what you got. I decide to give Chillis a try again never again for me. I spoke to my daughter and she said their Chillis in Rome was going the same way. If Chillis management reads these wake up before you go by the way side. The only reason I gave one star is because lowest score possible for this location. Sorry to rant but was so disappointed with this meal. Oh yes so greasy I had heartburn like Loius Grizzard said ""chilli dogs bark at night "".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peachtree-city,,,,,

15,Paul C.,"Atlanta, GA",0,11,3.0,2.0,2016-05-06,"Good good but very slow service. When we arrived the place was only half full. As the evening wore on and patrons filled in, the service went from slow to really slow. Had a mini dessert included in the meal but gave up waiting for it and paid and left. It's a shame because the food has really improved but the service was so slow it overshadowed the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peachtree-city,,,,,
13,T H.,"Atlanta, GA",0,14,,1.0,2016-05-25,"We ate here for lunch and ordered one of their lunch menu specials chicken quesadillas which were ok only with the lunch portion the give you 17 French fries and the dipping sauce was watered down I hate it when the manager goes super cheap with everything what a rip off, all to save a penny here or there but in the end going out of business since we've stopped going there, we're hoping with so many people leaving LA and coming to the new Hollywood Georgia we can get some good places to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peachtree-city,,,,,
11,Chloe B.,"Tyrone, GA",140,31,7.0,5.0,2016-06-04,"This is a really good chili's in my opinion. I've dined in here many times but I ordered to-go for the first time tonight. My food was hot and ready in the time they said it would be ready. I've ordered to-go from the neighboring Taco Mac many times, which is a few hundred feet from Chili's, and every time my food is either cold or the portions are tiny so I was skeptical that it would be the same at Chili's. I would gladly order take out again. Customer service was speedy and the bartender, who handles all take-out orders, was very polite. I have no complaints.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peachtree-city,,,,,

3,Karen R.,"Peachtree City, GA",454,351,574.0,5.0,2016-06-19,"3rd times the charm it seems.  Not too busy on father's day...guess because chili's isn't ""new"" and los to have poor management in the past.  Manager stopped by  to see how we liked our dnner.  We chose two of light fares. Mango Chili chicken and margarita chicken and got the two for $20 dinner combo. Guacamole and salsa. & chips for the appetizer. All really good. Great service too! Happy hour on beer & wine!  Going back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peachtree-city,,,,,

8,Kevin M.,"Sharpsburg, GA",0,16,9.0,3.0,2016-12-17,Most of the food is good here. We come often. Today I got the quesadilla explosion salad and the chicken was cold and rubbery. The chicken here is usually bad here. DONT ORDER ANYTHING CHICKEN.  The queso dip and salsa was great. Salads good. Classic nachos are pretty good too. Great place to eat if you avoid the chicken!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peachtree-city,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006

5,Chris G.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,12,1.0,1.0,2017-06-20,"Been coming for a while - it used to be good. Lately each time it has gotten worse. Not sure what has happened here, but we came for lunch over the weekend. Waited for 10 mins to be greeted by a server. Ordered. Had to ask for our drinks. 36 mins later our food came and two out of three entrees had been sitting so long that they were all ice cold. The server offered to bring us others, but after waiting that long? No thanks! My daughter wanted dessert. We ordered it. 10 mins later the server asks if we would like dessert. Ummm yes, the one we ordered from YOU! Everyone has off days and we are very patient people, but this is our third strike out at this place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-peachtree-city,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006

1,Jay R.,"Fayetteville, GA",40,1,,2.0,2017-10-09,"After hearing about my server having worked 2double shifts and then having open on Monday, we thought ok we aren't the complaining type, sorry.  And oh she's stressed because she has to serve the manager.  Hope she got that order right.. two out of three orders were right. Mine was not. Ordered the chicken enchiladas. Received the chicken fajitas.  When it was brought, she didn't care just said no that's what I ordered.  What????  Honestly, just didn't feel up to the hassle. I'm on vacation and just wanted a nice lunch out. .But seriously, as someone in the service industry, she needs an attitude adjustment or another career.
