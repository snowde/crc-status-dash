56,Robert S.,"Pflugerville, TX",58,67,,1.0,2013-08-07,"Ok maybe it is not fair to judge a place just after they opened. We went by on Sunday hoping they were open only to see a sign saying that employee training was in progress and they would open the following day.  Let me backtrack a little. This has always been a very small town and only recently have we started to get upscale sitdown restaurants. This chili's is our first national franchise so expectations were high. Well maybe they should have spent a tad more time training the employees. Our service was so bad we could not get mad. It was so bad it was laughable! Seriously! I felt sorry for them. This had to have been the singular worst restaurant service I have experienced.  For appetizers we chose the combo. Pick three of about nine different options.  Then the manager appeared at our table to tell us - oops. They were sold out of one of the items. Would we like to choose another? So we did. Only to have her again show up and say that they were out of that also. At this point I was ready to just ask exactly which appetizers they did have available. So we waited. And waited. About this time my drink finally shows up. We get our appetizers order straightened out. Finally.  Just in time for our entrees to hit the table. Then one by one the appetizers started to appear. Yes after the entree. My dinner salad also showed up. Should I say my additional dinner salad showed up?  My friend ordered a tea for his drink. Pretty simple. Then he was given a second. Not a refill. His original order a second time. He decides to switch to a mango iced tea. Naturally what is brought to our table is a regular lemonade and a mango lemonade as they couldn't remember which he ordered. Correct answer, none of the above. He ordered a blackberry iced tea. By this time he had five different soft drinks in front of him. I guess they thought they would just keep bringing out one of everything until they got it right. The entrees were good when they arrived except for I had barely touched my salad and the remainder of our appetizers still hadn't arrived. I also guess they urge their servers to rotate customers as fast as possible. This is understandable. But when it is 9:30 at night and the restaurant will be closing soon is the right time to ask  a customer if they want a to go box only minutes after they got their entree? Before we placed our orders we informed the server we had a coupon for a free dessert. She looked at it and made note on the order pad. While we were being rushed out the door after dinner I made a bet with my friend to see if she remembered the dessert. I bet no. He bet yes. He lost by asking her if she remembered we had a free dessert. She responded of course she didn't forget. She returned shortly asking to see the coupon and again asking what we wanted. I win!!!  When service is impossibly bad you can't get mad. All you can do is laugh and feel bad for them. I hope they iron out all their mistakes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pflugerville?start=80,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000005

I took the family to the new Chili's last week, and did not expect to have the experience we had. We started off with 2 appetizers, which didn't come out until our dinner arrived. When dinner arrived 45 minutes after ordering it, each entree came out at different times. One in our party didn't even get what she ordered! The server blamed it on someone stealing her order, and was very appologetic through the whole ordeal. We really knew there was a major problem when the 4 other tables around us, had very similar problems. It seemed like all of the customers were pissed. After a while it became comical. Everything was so wrong, that all we could do was laugh! We also joked that we were on a reality t.v show and were being punked. It was like, lets see how many ways we can mess these people's orders up before they walk out! I have 2 positives for this place, hence the 2 stars..

86,Ed S.,"Ballston Spa, NY",2,48,,4.0,2013-08-22,"I happened to be driving by one night about a week ago and saw that the restaurant was already opened.  I didn't even realize it.  If you've been to one Chili's you've been to them all in terms of food, that sort of thing.  I ate at the bar which was relatively empty for a 10 PM on a week night.  Bartender was nice and prompt as was the food.   My only issue came from the idea that this place would close so early.  I may have to physically go and check, but I didn't think that any Chili's closed before midnight anywhere.  The website says that all Chili's restaurants close at 11 PM on week nights and midnight on weekends, but this one closed at 10:30 on weeknights and 11:30 on weekends.  I'm not sure how accurate the website is.  I was really hoping for a late, late night restaurant in this small town of ours (maybe when the water park opens next year), so I was a little disappointed with the closing times.  Lewisville outside Dallas has chain restaurants that typically close at 2 or even 3 AM on weekend nights for instance. In any case, I am happy to read the one review that said while the place closed at 11:30 one night, they still accomodated people in the restaurant until 12:30 AM.  I can guarantee you that when football season rolls around those Hendrickson kids will be there as long as possible!!  They already flood the Whataburger parking lot next door from 10 PM to 1 AM on game nights, and I expect some, if not most, will migrate to Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pflugerville?start=60,2.192,2.192,2.192,2.192,2.192

My husband and I went there a few weeks ago, and we were attended by so many servers we lost count, yet we could never find anyone to flag down. I know they're training, but the flocks of trainees hovering around was stifling. When we asked our first server how his day was going, his response was ""meh."" We didn't see him again. The steak was the most bland and soft I've ever had in my life, and our dessert came out no fewer than 30 minutes after we ordered it. One of our servers explained that the cook botched our dessert and she made him make it again after he tried to send it out to us. I appreciate her honesty, but we could stand to be comped for a cake that was still overcooked and bland after we waited half an hour. I also stopped by for lunch takeout the other day, as the burger that I'd had at another Chili's location was really good, but again, the burger was so bland I threw much of it away. (!!! I never throw food away!) If not the worst burger I've ever had, it was pretty close. The so-called ""pepper gravy"" provided for the mashed potatoes was reminiscent of... well... something I'd rather not think about while eating white gravy. D: Threw that out too.

It's a nice sized restaurant, pretty open walkways, lots of seating options... it's what you would expect with a Chili's.  The parking is a little strange, the main parking lot is around the back side, and there's a semi-long walk down a ramp if you park along the side. Food-wise, my partner and I have always gotten our food out at a good pace and have had good attention by our servers on drink refills (also to-go drinks with our check, A+!) and getting our checks quickly.  Nothing to complain about our service! All in all, I have never really had anything to complain about at this location.  I'd give it 5 stars based on my experiences alone, but considering I've seen something go wrong at a table close by almost every time I've been here, I just can't.  I kind of feel bad with all these negative reviews already, but it's hard to expect 100% perfection from a place that was only open a few weeks.  I'd give them another chance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pflugerville?start=80,2.256,2.256,2.256,2.256,2.256

Chips were the same as always (good), but the salsa is different. Boo. I ordered an Old Timer, and it was good enough, nothing special.

39,Matt P.,"Austin, TX",35,88,46.0,2.0,2014-05-08,"As alluded to in other reviews, I am not a chain restaurant guy. However, this Chilis is one of the closest sit down joints from my house, so I've been here 4-5 times.  Also, when my give a damn is busted and the diet is thrown out the window, nothing scratches the itch like chili cheese fries and sliders.  I've had cold fries, barely warm chili, bad service, empty water and dirty dishes in front of me til I paid and left.  I've also had killer margaritas, great service and good food here too.  My diagnosis? Complete and utter failure in management in this place. Can't find a manager with a search warrant, sections and servers are out of whack, seems like the front and back of the house have little to no communication.  Seen the bar go down (more than once) cause of only one bartender (no manager in sight). Seen people wait at tables to be greeted or get drinks for 5-10 minutes (more times than I can count). I don't think it's unfixable by any means, I just think Chilis and their mega corporation should get their head out of the sand and give a brand new restaurant all the tools it needs to succeed until it can do it on its own.

I have given them numerous second chances due to the proximity to work/home... but after my last visit, I am officially done!!! During the week, one single bartender works the take out and entire bar. Food is always cold... so I gave up on the take out as well. She is sweet and always apologizes, but I always end up waiting for about 15 minutes every visit!!! My last dine in experience:  First off, I noticed that there was an alarm ""silenced"" on their fire alarm the moment I walked in the door (Smoke- RTU ""Roof Top Unit""). I have a similar system at work, but I think they should have that looked at and properly reset... just a liability waiting to happen. Then, I waited at the hostess stand for 15 minutes without being greeted by ANYONE. Two waiters refused to make eye contact... it was obvious that they just finished two big top tables and they had no interest in serving me and my two children. I should also note this was around 4 p.m. on a Sunday so the restaurant was virtually empty. I was obviously an inconvenience to most of the staff. Once we were finally seated, we were sat near the server kiosk. I got to overhear two waitresses cussing about their (lack of) tips... my children overheard this conversation as well. Food was slightly below average but I must commend our waitress. She was the only good part of my visit. I tried to enter my complaint on the Zoosk machine but it locked up on me. Frustrated, I left. I should add that the Zoosk machine is a great concept, but they need to find a better way to sanitize them... greasy fingerprints all over the one at our table.

Customer service was 5-stars. A few times something was messed up, lemon in my tea which I asked to not have, he fixed it right away, brought unsweetened tea when I wanted sweet-but I think he was surprised by that mistake too. Someone didn't sweeten the tea. But he fixed it, pretty much came over to let me know he wants to swap it out. My sons salad had croutons, asked to not have them, but my son didn't care after all. So there was a bit of messing up, but he apologized every time & fixed it promptly. We didn't wait for anything.  Appetizers came out quickly & timed perfectly with our dinners. The spinach dip was muuuuch better this time than last & the cheese fries were delish!!  My boys had mac n cheese, generous portions I might add. One son had a salad, again generous & the other a corn on the cob (full cob). They were stuffed!  I noticed no Bleu Cheeseburger on the menu, so when I asked if they had Blue Cheese crumbles to add, Michael was like ""oh absolutely!"" So I ordered the bacon cheddar burger & the BC was in a cup for me to add. It honestly was a damn good burger! Surprised the hell out of me! Cooked perfectly, seasoned well, juicy & pretty big.

I ordered a salad with chicken, the salad was crisp , fresh and the chicken was perfectly cooked, moist and tender.   The waiter was attentive during the course of our meal checking on food quality and refreshing drinks ( if I could recall his name, I'd give him a shout out).  Their new system of paying at the table using a modern point of sale combination entertainment/card swipe system is very convenient and  easy to use.  In the past at another location,  I noted an additional charge for use of the console (apparently due to one of my kids  playing some games) which to me was a negative up-sell. When i complained, the charge was immediately removed so the problem was very well taken care of.  In this location, while my son did mess around with the console a bit, there was no such charge on the bill. I did notice that on our way to our table, a couple sections appeared closed as it was not very busy yet.  When we left, the sections still appeared but closed but there was a number of people waiting to be seated.  I think the front managers can improve their service in this area.

I guess they needed something to distract you from how bad they are doing.... This particular visit was a fast one, we were in there for less than 30 minutes, but in that time, I got cold fries, a no follow thru on a request of Mustard, from a manager mind you, and a over sized-should have been sliced up piece of chicken in a pretzel bun that fell apart as soon as I bit in to it.

Have never had any real complaints recently- only when they 1st opened.. the service was SO SLOW then- but things have gotten WAY better! My most recent experience was this week, went with my Bestie during the week around 6:30pm to have a Large Draft Beer in the bar area. It's seat yourself in that area, so we found a tabletop and sat down. Thirsty and craving that cold refreshment, we unfortunately weren't attended to for about 5-10 minutes when FINALLY a waitress came and took our drink orders. Their drink specials during the week for Happy hour are pretty awesome- It was $3.25 for a LARGE mug of domestic draft beer or they also have $1.99 margaritas. We both ordered a large draft beer and I always ask for limes. The beers came right out and the waitress did me a HUGE favor by cutting up about 10 limes and bringing a bowl of them to the table- SWEETNESS (b/c I go through the limes..)! My friend had the Coors on tap and she said the beer could've been colder.. my budlight was just fine. I would suggest Colder mugs- don't know if they have a system where they can freeze the mugs so they are cold when they come out?      Also, they have appetizers on special until 6pm for weekday happy hour but we barely missed that- we did, however,have a coupon for a free Appetizer if you purchase an adult entree- so she ordered her an entree for lunch the next day so we could take advantage of some Chicken & Beef Nachos while toasting our beers.

With it being a major restaurant chain in the middle of a tri-town area (Pflugerville, Round Rock, Hutto), it is constantly packed and I don't think we've ever gone there when there wasn't a wait.  This is probably the only ""sports bar"" within any minimal distance so have fun trying to watch the game in the bar if that's your plan.  Service is typically slow, and this last time was no different except the waitress actually knew every bit about the menu (kuddos to her).  They have these kiosks on the table where you can reorder drinks and even pay your tab so you don't have to wait for the waiter/waitress to bring the check, and my husband had the bright idea to pay the bill before we were finished eating.  This meant getting a to go box was next to impossible. So to summarize, the food is generally pretty decent (however I do not recommend the steak or the smoked potatoes), service here is not good, prepare to wait for a table, and don't pay until you no longer need anything from your waitstaff.  I think we'll head over the Chili's in Round Rock from now on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pflugerville?start=40,2.24,2.24,2.24,1.4160000000000001,2.24

Besides the random school bus of high school students, there really weren't that many people dining in. From what I could see, there were at least five waitresses and a manager out on the floor. We came in, and yes they did tell us they were busy, so taking five minutes to get a server to come wait on us was not that big of a deal. When our waitress (which I will be nice enough not to name) came to our table she took our drink orders, but, was not very attentive and got his drink wrong. Simple mistake that was corrected, not that big of a deal. Then she came back maybe another five minutes later and took our order. We waited probably almost half an hour before she brought the food out. She got my order wrong, which again she corrected, but, all of the food was cold. My boyfriend commented that every time she came to the table she'd ask if we needed anything else, but, would walk past us while saying it like she expected that we wouldn't need anything. Which, bothered me a little, but, still wasn't going to make me tip her any less or anything. Then, she brought me another refill of tea which had black specs in it. My boyfriend then had to go to the bathroom for about half an hour due to the food upsetting his stomach (probably from being too cold...) At this point I was upset, but, I work in customer service so I know mistakes happen, and still was trying to keep a good attitude about the service we were getting. I wasn't expecting him to be in there that long, nor did I realize his stomach was so upset from the food, so I thought about telling the waitress it was his birthday. However, after waiting almost 25 minutes of that half hour for her to come to the table I decided against it and just asked for to go boxes. After my boyfriend got back to the table he told me about his stomach and we waited ten minutes for the boxes. When she brought them, one of the boxes was covered in grease! It was disgusting!!! I can't believe she didn't even spend a few seconds to check the boxes she was giving to her customers! So we asked for a new one after having to wait another ten minutes for her to come back. Then we had to wait another fifteen for the check, and while waiting we noticed sugar ants crawling all over the wall. That was it for me. After getting the ""grease box"" I was done trying to keep a good attitude. My boyfriend made a complaint with the manager, who rushed him mind you and was sitting in an office where she couldn't even see anything going on in the kitchen or floor. I decided that I needed to give them a review so that hopefully no one else will have to not only deal with this kind of service, but, with the uncleanliness we had to deal with.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pflugerville?start=80,2.2,2.2,2.2,1.4440000000000002,2.2

They have a great location, their manager...needs to be fired though, because this is one of the most poorly run Chili's I have ever been to and the staff is all horribly disorganized. You know what you are getting with the food, so there usually aren't any surprises there. The time before we went here, the table next to us had about 30 cups and plates just sitting there for about 30-40 minutes and then someone came by and cleared off half of it and then still left the rest. Our server was nice but she seemed like her head was off in another place. This last time we went, we sat in the bar...there was a wait on a Thursday (man Pflugerville peeps, you love your Chili's). We got seated, ordered drinks...waitress who I believe was named JoLanna seemed pretty nice and competent to start off with, but it looked like she might have been the primary person waiting on the entire bar area. Horrible planning there. I like that they have the 2 for $20 meals because it is a great deal. We opted to get fajitas and soup and salad. Our friends got a burger and chicken fingers...nothing too crazy. We were sitting around, and waited for our drinks to get refreshed...at this point our server seemed to be getting very distracted and just all over the place, we had to ask multiple times for drink refills. Our food took over 30 minutes to come out, and guess what...it was stone cold! My fajitas were NOT sizzling when they came out, burger was cold and chicken fingers were cold. She did not even bring out the soup and salad for my honey (I mean how hard is it to get that order out compared to everything else). We sat there for awhile longer before she finally came back and she said, ohhhh that's why the lady in the back said I needed to come back there and follow her out with the soup and salad..WOOPS. And she giggled about it and tossed her hair as if that would make it all OK, no apologies about it all and only excuses. But then, instead of going back to get it for him...she did her rounds and went and got another table a glass of wine before she got his food...just speechless on that. And he was starting to get a bit hangry and wanted to just send it all back, but I talked him down. The shift lead came by to ask how everything was and we said, well it would be fine if all of our food wasn't cold and the waitress was a bit more attentive. So we got a discount off the bill, she offered to re-fire the food and said she would make sure it didn't take forever to come out again but we passed on it all.  Our waitress finally comes by and asks again if she can get us a dessert...we just declined and joked with her that it would probably come out cold if it was supposed to be warm and warm if it was supposed to be cold. She giggled again and carried on, she did bag us some extra soups but it's not like that was going above and beyond what she could do with the unlimited soup and salad meal option. When we got home, my honey got pretty sick from something he ate, which was just soup and salad...so I am not sure what went wrong there. I really think if whomever is in charge around here takes some time to properly train the staff and maybe staffs a little bit more appropriately when they are busy then they would get better reviews. BUT, don't think it really matters because they will still always be packed due to their optimal location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pflugerville,2.08,2.08,2.08,1.4440000000000002,2.08

Sadly, the experience was no better. We arrived shortly before six thirty. We were seated immediately, which was great. However, it then took over an HOUR for our food to be delivered to our table, and when it arrived it was cold, my husband's salmon was burnt so badly it was almost inedible, and it looked (and tasted) like my enchiladas had been sitting out for at least twenty minutes. We didn't want to waste any more time since our kids were hungry, so we just ate and asked for our check. It took another THIRTY minutes for our waiter to come back with the check after that.

My family and I have given them multiple opportunities since we enjoy the atmosphere, menu and price of food chain itself but my recent experience at this particular establishment will also be my last.  Every single time we've come to this Chili's the service is abysmal. I don't have a high expectation coming in so I'm not someone that demands the type of service you'd get at a 4-star restaurant but when you have to wait over 5 minutes to have a server even come greet you after being seated during their slow period, then you know something's up.  Most people would assume it's a lack of available waiters or over-crowded rush hour but every time we've gone, we make sure to go in between 'rush' hours.  During our last visit, I saw waiters sitting in the back chit-chatting; again I'm not a uptight customer who doesn't want servers to have a quick breather but while we waited for our initial welcome none of the servers were even walking the floor to check on other patrons.  The hostess (who was not very friendly in greeting us to begin with) looked over at us a few times during our wait and didn't even come by to apologize.   We decided to walk-out, in full view of the manager in charge who didn't say anything either.  The visit before this last one, they got our order wrong and that was after they brought our orders out at different time intervals.  On top of that, we waited a relatively long time to even get the appetizers and chips we ordered.  Essentially, nothing about their service is redeemable. When we informed the manager, she just apologized and offered us a free dessert.  This is my first time writing a negative review of a chain restaurant on Yelp because I usually let a lot of these things roll off my back but this place is terrible.

We had 4 triple dippers, a kids pizz, a big mouth bites, and a classic bacon burger ketchup and pickles only. We were told 20 minutes for pick up. I waited about 25 minutes before going to get it. I get there and I don't see our food ready. I paid 85 with a tip and asked how much longer before our food was ready. I was told 5 minutes because of all the triple dippers because of all the fried food. I said ok and set a timer on my phone and waited. It was about another 12 minutes before we were brought our food. I asked for my receipt and checked my food. I opened the triple plays and was stunned by how little food is in there. I understand these are smaller portioned apps but it had chicken tenders about the size of baby carrots and 4 of the smallest wings I have ever seen when I asked what was the explaination she said that is what it is. She then said oh I forgot your fries I'll be right back. I went through the rest of the food and every triple play was like the first smallest portions ever and very unappealing. I've been here sitting in the restruant and have had the same thing and was given enough for two people to eat off of. I got out fries a few minutes later and asked again is this really it and was told that that is what it comes with. I said ok and left I will not be going back again as this was a very unsatisfactory experience for what I spent on my food and it still left my family hungry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pflugerville?start=80,1.8,1.8,1.8,1.956,1.8000000000000003

35,A. C.,"Pflugerville, TX",1,6,,1.0,2016-12-27,"0 stars here. I wanted to make a to go order and the whole interaction was terrible. Took 4 calls to actually have someone pick up. Waited 15 minutes on hold before I could make a to go order. I'm sure you're thinking-why did you wait 15 minutes on the phone, dummy? The answer is that I actually drove to the Chili's and was staying on hold to see if someone would answer before I got there. Not joking, someone answered as I was walking in. I'm not sure if that's funny or sad. Probably both. So, I complain to the Manager that it should never take 4 phone calls OR 15 minutes on hold to place a to go order and his response was ""I'm sorry sir, I apologize for the lack of service. Can I offer you a drink while you wait or maybe a free appetizer?"". Haha and George Strait's got ocean front property in Arizona. He actually said ""Sorry man, we're just busy. I had a line cook call in and a few servers not show up so do you still want food or not?"" In the most annoyed tone possible.  I've been managing for over a decade and I can say from experience that you should never throw your team under the bus or make excuses for poor performance. The whole experience was awful and the only reason I write this review is because I hope that people read this and don't waste their precious time or money here. When there are major issues at the top of the chain I can guarantee that there are issues at the bottom. AKA who knows how they handle food/sanitation etc..

For the entree we chose the bacon burger (comes with fries) and their bacon ranch chicken quesadillas (comes with sour cream, lettuce & pico de gallo.) Their burger was okay, kind of greasy, I think they put butter on top of the bun. The burger was a little hard to eat because it was over-cooked so the meat was tough. The fries were alright.. My in-laws got the Texas cheese fries (comes with bacon, jalapeno, ranch, green onions) -- it was really good! The two entrees they chose was the Margarita chicken which comes with black beans and rice & their steak and broccoli. Their sodas were bottomless so we got free refills & to-go cups as well.
