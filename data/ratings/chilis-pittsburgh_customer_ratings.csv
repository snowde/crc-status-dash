23,Malik H.,"Cleveland, OH",1,7,,2.0,2012-11-06,"I like chili's m, its one of nice places to go . But my experience in this place was different, the portions of the appetizers was smaller than any other branch, the waiters are just doing the minimal job requirement, i mean they just smile on your face and change their facial expression the second they turn around.I think they are not trained professionally.   I hope the management to improve , because its sad to see all of this bad reviews on one my favorite restaurant .

19,Lucretiz C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",799,419,493.0,1.0,2012-12-18,"Food that's not even fit for a dog.  I set the bar very low when dining at Chili's and I'm never disappointed.  I ordered the steak fajitas which were served with the standard grilled steak , grilled peppers and onions. The flavor was what to be expected not spicy but charred however the steak was mangled as if a dog had first eaten off my plate and I was left with just scraps.  I don't even want to know who Chili's has working the grill...because I would just pity them, that they would even allow food to leave the kitchen that way.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pittsburgh,2.084,2.084,2.084,2.084,2.0840000000000005
30,Michael P.,"Oakmont, PA",9,7,,1.0,2013-06-26,"I've never been a big fan of Chili's, the saltiest restaurant in the country. This past experience was especially terrible. We were there as a family with 5 people and the service was very sub par. Our food did not come out together and the order was incorrect. Although the servers were friendly, the food was among the worst I have had at a Chili's. Everything was over seasoned and over cooked. At the Waterworks Mall there are several other food choices. I would recommend any of them over this Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pittsburgh?start=20,2.084,2.084,2.084,2.084,2.0840000000000005
8,Chelsea M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",304,744,469.0,2.0,2013-07-16,"I wanted to like this chili's, but i think i give up here. Even though their menu seems fairly large, everything seems to be the same. I can never decide what i want & nothing hardly ever sticks out to me. Also, service is hit or miss. I've had okay service one time but another time was no so good. We had a new server who probably wasn't ready to be out on his own to make a good impression for their restaurant. (I'm only saying this because I've been a server for a few places.. a few more days of following someone, he would've been ready).  On our last visit, we sat around for a good 8-10 minutes before our server came over for the 1st time. It might not seem long but the restaurant wasnt busy (our half of the restaurant had a total of 2 other tables) & we didnt even get a quick ""be with you in one moment"" or anything.  Finally, i'm no fan of waiting long for my food, but i should atleast wait long enough to know that it was fresh. We ordered our food, had a quick 2 minute convo, then i used the restroom to washed my hands. On my way out, our food was being brought to our table. hmmmm... i waited longer to be greeted than for my food to come out? Something doesnt seem right. It was hot but i'm a little worried how long it had been sitting under heating lamps :\ I'll take my $35+ elsewhere for a decent dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pittsburgh,2.248,2.248,2.248,2.248,2.248

The shrimp tacos were skimpy with the shrimp, and the spice level was more mild than spicy, but the shrimp was cooked ok and my stomach doesn't hurt, so they pass.  The beans and rice are another story.  Really bland, no flavor.  Oh well at least I didn't pay...

I was a bit disappointed for sure. I love that the beer comes out in chilled mugs, but they don't have the temperature right here since I got frozen bits at the top of my beer. I also am really missing the awesome blossom and was sad to see that it was not on this menu. My friend and I got the  2 for $20 dinner. I got the margarita chicken which was just meh and my friend got the Cajun chicken pasta, which besides the good chicken, not that great. As an appetizer we got the Texas fries and those were the best thing we had all night. I may come back and get what I used to get back home, the steak fajitas.

I got home open up my bag and see there's no quesadillas on the salad ... I call chili's management was very rude she said cheese flaps as she called them were only worth a  1.99 and I'm not making you another salad for a 1. 99 worth of food and also I don't have access to any vouchers to send and she hung up on me and would not answer the phone again.... Stay clear of this place they do not remedy their mistakes..  I will not be going back at this location Jan 20th 2014 11 p.m. Management was rude 855 Freeport road waterworks mall...

10,Ana G.,"Pittsburgh, PA",230,342,147.0,2.0,2014-06-28,"I haven't been back to a Chili's in a long time and when we were given a gift card after moving to Pittsburgh we decided to use it. Their service was really nice, but their food was lacking. My husband and I shared their fajitas for 2 and were given the wrong kind of protein, we asked for pork, chicken, and beef. We were given shrimp instead of chicken so they replaced it with the chicken. The waitress let us have the shrimp, but decided to not eat them since they seemed a little under cooked. Also when our sides to the fajitas were served we noted that the beans were cold, and had to flag down the waitress to heat them up.  I will say that their pork was really good as well as their beef, their guacamole was tasty but could use more lime.  The ambiance was nice and the place was clean. But overall despite the friendly service, we were not very impressed with their food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pittsburgh,,,,,
16,Callie O.,"Pittsburgh, PA",70,149,40.0,1.0,2014-07-21,"Friends don't let friends eat at (most) chain restaurants. I should have known better. My boyfriend and I were super hungry, and we wanted to spend a little time out enjoying the evening. We had a $25 GC for Chili's and thought this to be a good time to use it. (Hey, being broke really sucks!) We walked in and were cheerfully greeted by the hostess. Once we were seated, we waited quite awhile for the server to come and take our drink order. By the time he arrived, we already knew what we wanted.  He seemed rushed and impatient. That made me feel anxious and embarrassed, and I don't like that feeling when I am going to eat....or basically ever. We went with the appetizer and two entrees for $20. We chose the onion strings and jalapenos. You can't go wrong with fried onions, right? Wrong. Super wrong. They were really salty and peppery, and it was hard to finish them. In fact, we didn't even get a chance. The waiter took the leftovers without even asking if we were finished!  A long long wait went between our appetizer and our entree. We ended up ordering the 5-cheese pizzas. They eventually arrived, and they looked good. They were lukewarm though, and we were missing ranch that we had asked for multiple times.  So we waited an eternity to get ranch. This pizza desperately needed the ranch to make it palatable. Seriously. It was that bad.  The server kept taking ages to come back and pay attention to our needs. I ordered a Blue Moon, and it took super long for that to come to the table too. I needed a drink after going through what we went through for this meal! Oh, but he didn't even ask to see my I.D. Some people might think that's cool, but I am extremely bothered when I.D. checking is not strongly enforced. I could have easily been an underage girl, in fact, a lot of people think I am! I thought this was extremely irresponsible and dangerous behavior, and it's not something I would expect from ANY establishment!  Other complaints include the fact that what is vegetarian and not vegetarian on their menu is rather ambiguous. Did you know that their seasoned tomatoes are seasoned with some kind of animal-protein based seasoning? What is that about? Gross.  I really dislike leaving bad reviews, but our experience here was just so awful. I felt bad for the server because he seemed like he was having a hard time, but everything kept getting worse, and it is extremely unacceptable.  I will not return to this Chili's, nor will I go to any other Chili's in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pittsburgh,,,,,
22,Mark K.,"Carroll Park, PA",28,123,115.0,4.0,2014-08-25,"To everyone bitching about the food, I have to say, it's a chili's. I don't expect top of the line super duper tex mex. But I have been here two times and the service and food have always been good or what I expect. It's a little pricey for what you get but not a rip off. My fajitas where good. I got the trio and it was loaded with all three meats. My girlfriend had the chicken bacon avocado sandwich. She really enjoyed it. My only complaint would be not enough tortillas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pittsburgh?start=20,,,,,
17,Kate H.,"Pittsburgh, PA",190,33,191.0,2.0,2014-11-04,"Usually the service at Chili's is decent, but today they split the tables and one waitress, our primary waitress, was pretty flat out horrible. The entire night our waitress was simply rude with a poor attitude. Turns out she was a ""trainer"" for another waitress, and here I was thinking she was the trainee.  Ordering a simple salad was a chore because finding out what dressing was vegan was a tall hop, skip and a jump through their staff and ziosk atop the table. They weren't understanding that I couldn't have honey and continued to suggest items containing it.  When asking how to navigate the ziosk's dietary restrictions, all I got was hostility.  Surprise, when it was time to get the check, she turned the charm on and according to our bill, the sour server was named Becky.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pittsburgh,,,,,
11,Meghan S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",8,29,7.0,5.0,2014-11-14,"Since joining Yelp, I've been asking myself: am I a bad person? It must be true, because I actually sort of really like most chain restaurants. Hmph.  Anyway, I was in the mood for steak but didn't want to pay a ridiculous amount, so a friend and I decided on Chili's. Maybe the service is lacking on weekends, but it was great on this Wednesday evening. We actually had 3 different servers checking on us, and hardly had to wait at all for anything. We started with the soft pretzels. I didn't care for the queso but my friend really liked it. I had the sirloin with loaded mashed potatoes and broccoli. The broccoli was a little to salty/seasoned, but I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. Friend had the Cajun Pasta, which was delicious, but came out a little cold. I also had some kind of tropical martini, I think. I can't remember the name, but it was tasty and on the strong side (mmm). We split the Skillet Chocolate Chip Cookie. Amazing. Each table has a ziosk, where you can look at the menu, pay with a card, figure out the tip, and play games (there is a fee for the games!). I hope this doesn't eliminate restaurant jobs, but I really liked it... Friend would probably give a lower rating because his pasta was a little cold. But I'm the one writing the review, so I say 5 stars. Overall it was a good experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pittsburgh,,,,,
13,Ann C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2,10,22.0,1.0,2015-04-25,My experience could have been better here. Got a shared appetizer w/no plates. Waitress brought them 10min after our food arrived so that we could eat cold food. Ordered a margarita that Sat at the bar 15min before the waitress remembered to bring it so it was watered down.  Salad entree was okay. My kid ordered fajitas and the wraps came out 20min before the rest of her dinner?? Appetizer was cold in the middle so I'll probably never come here again. I really hate paying for meals w/below mediocre service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pittsburgh,,,,,
12,Robert U.,"Pittsburgh, PA",130,696,131.0,3.0,2015-07-10,"This is a decent Chili's.  The food is good and is consistent.  Service is friendly, but variable in terms of speed.  The whole place is a bit dark and in need of serious freshening up - it's 1993 in here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pittsburgh,,,,,
3,Tyoko B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",145,267,791.0,2.0,2015-10-31,"It is just bad. What happened? I order fajitas and the green peppers and onions were raw. It was like they threw them on the sizzling plate right before bringing it to the table. The manager offered to have the cook redo my veggies. Huh? So I guess I was supposed to sit at the table and pick out the raw ones along with the few that were wilted. Since I had barely touched it, I would've just preferred my whole entree cooked the right way together. After all, I go out to eat when I want the convenience of not having to cook/clean up. If I need to dissect my meal to fix it, kinda pointless to go out.  The 2 stars are only for the waitress because she wasn't the one to blame for my food and happened to be very friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pittsburgh,,,,,
14,Tricia B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",53,202,264.0,1.0,2015-12-12,"I'm not a huge frequenter of chain restaurants, but this Chili's is by my house and I can order takeout online and walk to pick it up, so sometimes the convenience lures me in. Every time I order something for take out here, I have a bad experience. I don't know why I keep going back. A couple of months ago I got sick after eating some enchilada soup that I picked up from here. A few weeks ago I ordered their crispy chicken crispers meal, and they tasted like burnt grease and rubber. Seriously the WORST chicken I've ever had anywhere, and I've eaten chicken tenders from gas stations before (yeah, I'm not proud of that, but I'm willing to share that embarrassing fact with you just to drive home how horrible this chicken was!)  And just the other night I ordered a creamy cajun chicken pasta dish. The pasta was hard and dry, there was about a tablespoon of sauce in the whole dish, and there was no cajun flavor, despite it being in the name! I ate two bites and threw the rest away. I'm not one who usually wastes food, but it was truly terrible. I don't know if their food is this bad when you dine in, but I am DONE with takeout food here.  I don't give out one star reviews often, but the to-go food from this particular Chili's is definitely worthy of this dubious honor!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pittsburgh,,,,,
25,Vanessa S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,14,,2.0,2016-02-01,"My husband and I came here for dinner and I ordered a new steak that they had on the menu  and asked that they didn't put the spicy sauce on it and that I'd like it medium-well, everything else I kept the same, not too difficult of an order. The steak came out and it was medium rare so I asked if they could cook it longer. At this restaurant two servers wait on one table so the other girl brings my steak back out and it is cooked longer but they put the spicy sauce on it. I tell the girl I can't eat it due to a food allergy and she looks irritated and takes it back. Ten seconds later the other guy comes back out with my same steak but the sauce is gone, they just wiped it off! By this time my husband was done with his meal so I said forget it, I'm not going to wait for a whole new steak at this point. The manager came out and said she would take mine off the bill (I would hope so considering I didn't eat it). We were both extremely dissatisfied. I went home and had a bowl of cereal for dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pittsburgh?start=20,,,,,
5,Matthew U.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2086,1447,650.0,2.0,2016-03-21,"A chain, fast casual restaurant that cranks out the food as fast as it can.  Showing up here to celebrate a friend's birthday felt like we were being hurried.  If I am here to celebrate, don't try to push me out. Seating was the easy part, our server was great.  He was funny, able to make suggestions for those that weren't sure and completely on top of his game throughout the whole time we were there.  Who wasn't on top of their game?  The manager.  If you want your customers (especially those that are part of a large party) to feel welcomed with hopes of them coming back, don't stand within earshot of ""Table 43"" and start complaining about how long we were taking.  Yes I heard you Miss Manager, I am not dumb, your tabletop touchscreen displays the table numbers and 43 just happened to be ours.  I thought that it was a good thing that the table kept ordering items, going for a dessert round, that equates to a higher bill and more revenue for your restaurant, maybe a higher tip for your serving staff.  What it actually ended up doing was irritating me that you said it loudly enough to be passive aggressive and kept staring at our table.  You obviously don't want business in here because you will no longer be getting mine. Asides from that huge hiccup, the food was decent, prices reasonable, mixed drinks watered down, atmosphere was meh.  So your typical subpar Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pittsburgh,,,,,

My drink never reaches half empty before another is brought. The servers are all friendly and have smiles on their faces. I always order the same thing.. Crispy chicken crispers.. sides are corn on the cob and homestyle fries. I usually sub out the fries for steamed broccoli. The chipotle sauce is a perfect addition to the crispers.

The chicken on my grilled chicken salad was ice cold and showed no signs of it ever even touching a grill (was home and eating in 10 minutes). There was no dressing on the salad and none was in the container or in the bag so I had to eat a dry salad. My wife had ordered a vegetarian friendly salad and it had chicken on it. They reluctantly remembered her dressing. They also forgot our chips and salsa.
