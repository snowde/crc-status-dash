35,Dave W.,"Lockport, IL",1,2,2.0,5.0,2012-07-23,"A friend and I stopped into Chili's one night for dinner, and happened to ask the bartender about catering for about 40 people for my Wife's 40th Birthday Party. The Manager (Nick Brooks) came over and went through the whole menu with us, and gave some great ideas and suggestions. Nick was Polite, Personable, and Professional all at the same time. I arrived at 4:30 on Saturday to pick the food up, everything was hot and ready to go, they even had people there to load everything into my car. The party went off perfectly and the food was a big hit. I highly recommend if you are having an event and need some catering, check out Chili's in Plainfield.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainfield-4?start=20,2.7399999999999998,2.7399999999999998,2.7399999999999998,2.7399999999999998,2.7399999999999998
34,Jill B.,"Plainfield, IL",0,1,,1.0,2012-10-20,"Probably the worst dinner I've ever had at chili's. Not only was our food cold, we had to send it back to reheat it, but my aunts dinner came out 10 minutes AFTER we got ours. They told us they were still cooking it however I've worked in the industry and that means it wasn't put in because you don't bring the order to the table until it's all ready. They had to cook it on the fly.  I realize things happen, but we are extremely disappointed. If I wanted cold food I would've stayed home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainfield-4?start=20,2.308,2.308,2.308,2.308,2.308
11,Angela P.,"Aurora, IL",440,1743,13.0,4.0,2012-11-29,"If you're going to order takeout, call ahead.  Because if you walk in and place a takeout order, you're going to wait a really long time.  And even if you call ahead, you're still going to wait when you get there.  Unless, you know, it took you an hour to get there. I use the takeout service when I'm craving Chili's, but I'm too lazy to go inside and dine in. We've dined at this location several times, and I'm always satisfied with the food and service.  Menu is the same as other Chili's, my favorites being the Sante Fe chicken wrap and the chicken crispers.  The margaritas are $3 on some days, and I love me a mango margarita!  They are very sweet, so if you like your margarita tasting mostly like tequila, you better order something else.  The Corona-ritas are pretty tasty as well, but a little pricey. This place never seems very crowded, and there's fairly attentive service when you dine in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainfield-4,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997

29,Ana W.,"Naperville, IL",0,1,,1.0,2014-02-18,If i could give negative stars I would. Frequent customer at this location. Tonight I visited with my 6-year-old son who left his brand new book behind. Within 20 minutes we called expecting to stop by and pick up the book.  No luck - book is gone and I have a gutted child. The woman I spoke to on the phone didn't even offer to take a phone number and call if it was found. Either the clientele or the staff are a problem. Either way Chili's has lost a customer.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainfield-4?start=20,,,,,
21,Lisa M.,"Romeoville, IL",0,14,2.0,1.0,2014-09-21,"This has to be the worst restaurant I have ever experienced. We waited an hour and 20 minutes and didn't receive our meals.

27,Evelyn B.,"Brentwood, Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,2014-12-03,First time I go I get seated and food served in a timely manner. I get ready to go and no one is to be found. So I check out with their Ziosk and didn't even see the waitress to say goodbye. Second time we finish eating and the same thing happened again! This time I had left overs and wanted a to go box. I had to ask someone at the bar for one. I paid at the Ziosk once again and left. Good thing for the ziosk or else I would be late back from lunch. Third time I phone in my order. I get there 20 minutes later. They look at me like I'm crazy when I go to pick up. Turns out they never be entered my order. Poor service... It's unfortunate that it has to be the location closest to my work...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainfield-4?start=20,,,,,

22,Andrea M.,"Joliet, IL",3,46,,1.0,2015-03-06,"I had the worst experience ever!!!! I will never return!!!! The waiter was actually super attentive that was not the problem the problem was when it came time to pay my bill I was charged 2 wrong bills!!!! Then I was charged my correct bill. Problem was the two wrong amounts were showing up on my banking mobile the correct amount was not, even at the bank my personal banker pulled up my account and the two wrong amounts were there pending not the correct amount! I called the manager Kevin the next day and he assured me the right amount would debit my account and the two wrong amounts would fall off and then he proceeded to tell me he would send me some chilis coupons for all my trouble!!! It took over a week for the 2 wrong amounts to ""fall off"" & I never got the free coupons for my troubles! So I called him back 2 weeks later & asked about my free coupons & he said he had sent them!? So he took my address again & assured  me he would send me some really good coupons to come in and use at Chili's! A $5 coupon came in the mail and then there was another one stuck to it so it total of $10 in coupons to use at Chili's for a mistake that was $100 and took a week to resolve!!!! That's crazy shit! Not acceptable!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainfield-4?start=20,,,,,

I had the beef nachos. They were Pretty good. A big order that I could only eat half. Place was clean and not very busy. The person I was with had tacos.

7,Yanni B.,"Naperville, IL",5,31,2.0,5.0,2016-02-22,"I come here with my sister usually on Saturdays when both of our parents are working.  The location is very visually appealing and has a very organized system to ensure the shortest wait time and a great experience. We usually get sat in 5-10 minutes even when it is pretty busy. We always ask for Kaily because she is super sweet and she is very consistent with making sure our orders are perfect and that are drinks/appetizers are doing well! We are never disappointed by her and she gives a very nice impression of the restaurant.  The food is very delicious and we always enjoy getting the big mouth bites and enchiladas. The table side queso is super yummy with tortilla chips with the beef and gooey cheese! Not only that, but the molten lava cake is definitely something to finish off the meal even if you are about to explode. Definitely come down to this location for excellent customer service and great food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainfield-4,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84
20,Lisa H.,"Yorkville, IL",43,55,44.0,4.0,2016-03-05,"Went to this location a week ago. Was not super busy which was nice...around 8pm. Was told a 10 minute wait so went to sit at bar. There was a booth and we started to sit down and a server rudely said ""You can't sit there"". Well, it looked like part of the bar area so wth? We sat at the bar. Bartender very friendly. Got chips & salsa....always great! My frozen strawberry margarita was perfect. Less than 10 minute wait for the booth right on the other side of where we tried to sit which is right by the kitchen. Noise didn't really bother us. Our server was outstanding!!! Fast and super nice!! I had sirloin steak....a bit undercooked for medium and meat was tough but tasted good. Loaded mash delicious with broccoli. My friend had the triple sampler chicken strips, southwestern egg rolls & fried pickles. All were good. Love the egg rolls. Server was very attentive and we left feeling very full!!! I would definitely go back to this location!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainfield-4?start=20,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96
4,Karl R.,"Bolingbrook, IL",31,6,1.0,1.0,2016-04-28,Nothing like not eating all day placing a online order.  Picking it up getting home opening your order up to find a key ingredient is wrong and not what was requested.   Thanks for ruining my dinner tonight.  Although your gesture of a gift certificate was nice it doesn't fix how I feel in frustration and disappointment.  If I wanted my order wrong I would go to a fast food drive thru.  Simple things go a long way.  Hope my refusal of your offer puts some insight on getting the little things right mean the biggest things to people. Batting 1000% not only was my order wrong as I said.  I find onion peels in it and uncooked onions for half of it!   Awesome!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainfield-4,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88
9,John O.,"Naperville, IL",0,25,1.0,1.0,2016-07-29,I do like Chili's and go a couple times a month  but I had a bad visit at the Plainfield location. The waitress was nice but was clearly not familiar with the drinks or food menu. We thought she was new but she said no. They were missing a significant portion of their coke freestyle flavors and we were told they don't have blenders to make ice drinks?? The service was very slow and our soups came out with the entrees. The food was not bad and was usual good flavor profiles that chilis delivers. I will go to a different location if we go back to chilis at all.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainfield-4,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76

My daughter and I love going to Chili's on Tuesdays when kids eat free and we always get the molten chocolate cake which is my daughter's favorite, and now that the have the mini ones it makes our visit a success!!!

6,Terence W.,"Aurora, IL",106,86,62.0,2.0,2016-11-12,"Wow has Chilis really dropped off. Ten years ago, this was our go to place for good fajitas, margaritas, and chips and queso. I keep telling myself to stick to small chain restaurant because the food is typically better. So I decided to try and and give Chilis a try because how much can a restaurant drop off? The answer to this question is a lot. First of all, the con queso was terrible. Whenever I eat queso, the color of the dip more yellow than brown. Presentation of food is a big deal to me because I am a visual eater. The queso dip was brown and it looked like it was Sitting under the heater for an extended amount of time. This was the first time I have never finished queso dip. Now on the fajitas, the fajitas took an extremely longtime to come out and when they finally came out, they were hot but not sizzling. Whenever I eat fajitas, I expect them to come out sizzling. Chilies used to be the leader in fajitas. Now they're fajitas are extremely average at best. This is another reminder to eat at small chains because they take pride in the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainfield-4,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68
2,Megan C.,"Chicago, IL",384,53,14.0,5.0,2017-01-03,"Came in on a Friday night for dinner with my SO. We did the 2 for $22 deal and thoroughly enjoyed the appetizer. We both ordered the Chicken Cajun Pasta as our entree and both came out at the same time. His pasta came out fine, but mine was extra liquidy; at first I just thought it was the juice from the tomatoes but soon I found it unbearable to eat since it was just too wet. The server came by and I voiced my concerns, he was super accommodating and offered to have it remade or for me to order a new entree right away. I chose to get it remade and they had it out ASAP (and the plating was beautiful! They must have done extra quality control on that one!) During my wait, the manager Jeff was super sweet and even offered me a soup or salad while I waited! Jeff also came back another time to make sure that the replacement dish was good (it was perfect). Great location, great management. Would definitely come back again! Dining here was an excellent experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-plainfield-4,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8

I'm pretty sure the salad was a mistake earlier and they just put it in the refrigerator until we ordered it. Also took a really long time to get served.
