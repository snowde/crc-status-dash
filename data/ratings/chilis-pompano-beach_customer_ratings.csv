21,Dave P.,"Naperville, IL",5,108,,3.0,2012-03-23,"Food was typical for Chili's.  If you went there expecting something else you should go there instead.  Chips and Salsa a mainstay.  Service was good, food was expected.  The one thing that I can say that stands out to me was coming back from the Boys room you can see in the Kitchen.  A broom might be a good thing to purchase and use occasionally.  It borders on nasty.  Some people that care about a clean kitchen might leave if they see this one.  Clean it up and you are good to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pompano-beach?start=40,2.38,2.38,2.38,2.38,2.38
24,Siri G.,"Orlando, FL",0,99,3.0,4.0,2012-06-15,This is a pretty good chilis. We live down the street so we frequent here often. The waiters are pleasant and the food is fast and quick. After going to a few other chilis lately while traveling I've realized this one is way better. I don't know if I can recommend all chilis but I can recommend this one.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pompano-beach?start=40,2.416,2.416,2.416,2.416,2.416
20,Ashley C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",3,8,,1.0,2013-05-27,"I'm not one to write a negative review or send a dish back but this is a first for me.  I typically always order the same dish when I dine at any Chili's but I was surprised when the dish arrived and it was very overcooked, I asked the waiter to send it back and without an exchange of words took it away.  I asked to speak to a manager based on the rudeness of the server but was in shock that the manager actually backed up the server saying we cook all dishes for the same amount of time so there was no way it was overcooked! Hopefully this is not a normal act of behalf of management but regardless I will not be returning to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pompano-beach?start=40,2.02,2.02,2.02,2.02,2.02
23,David A.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,10,,2.0,2014-02-15,"Placed an order to go that included ribs.  When I arrived home I found they forgot the BBQ sauce - which is obviously a big problem for ribs.  Called the manager to let them know and was offered a free dessert HOWEVER I would need to come back to the restaurant to pick it up.  Needless to say, I declined.  Based on my single experience with this location, you need to check your order before you leave the store or you may be disappointed when you get home.  For me, this is too much trouble so I won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pompano-beach?start=40,2.184,2.184,2.184,2.184,2.184
18,Britt Z.,"Delray Beach, FL",976,425,2157.0,3.0,2014-03-24,"Late Saturday afternoon a friend & I stopped in to this Chili's to grab a margarita. We walked right in & grabbed a booth in the bar area. It took quite a few minutes for our server to approach us & I was extremely thirsty. We quickly ordered a Presidente Margarita, two glasses of water & chips & salsa.  Although the chips were warm & fresh I found them to be very salty. I like the salsa a lot. It's not to spicy & it's more like a picante sauce because it is not thick & chunky. They give you a nice sized portion of both the chips & salsa & will even give you more if you ask. Which I did because we ran out of salsa. I later found out the chips & salsa are complimentary in the bar. I thought that was pretty cool. Maybe that is why the chips are so salty??? So we would order more drinks..... hmmmm. Just a thought. We shared the Presidente Margarita. It is a very smooth drink & they serve it to you in this cool blue shaker along with two small margarita glasses. We requested they leave off the salt & they did. This margarita is yummy. It has great flavor but does not taste like it's loaded with alcohol. Don't let that fool you because they are strong. We ordered a 2nd one & I was feeling good. :) We shared the Margherita Flatbread. It had monterey jack, mozzarella, roasted garlic aioli, tomatoes & a drizzle of cilantro ranch pesto. This was really good. It was thin & crispy & just delicious. I would go back just for this flatbread. The restaurant seemed to be busy for a late Saturday afternoon. Our server was friendly although I personally think she had a few to many tables. Still even if she was slammed, she remained calm & very attentive.  The prices are very inexpensive. I think the Presidente Margarita was like seven or eight dollars & it serves 2 nice sized drinks. Anywhere else it would have been much higher. I believe the Flatbread Pizza was about eight dollars & it was huge. It was large enough to share as an appetizer or even make a great lunch or light dinner by itself. I am not a fan of chain restaurants. But for a great margarita, some chips & salsa & a yummy appetizer I was very happy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pompano-beach,2.252,2.252,2.252,2.252,2.252
29,Maria M.,"Denver, CO",31,109,120.0,4.0,2014-04-14,Went back to chillis on powerline and mcnab. Service was horrible. Waitress seemed attitudy and you can tell she didn't want to be there. Food was good though. We had classic bacon burger and ribs. The drinks were watery at first (margaritas) but the last one was good. We had 4. I find no consistency in this chillis.

I had a server named Kenneth and he was extremely rude to me and my friends. He first asked my friend for her ID because she wanted an alcoholic beverage to celebrate her 21st birthday and told her she wasn't 21 (even though it was her birthday), and threw it back at her. We then ordered her a cake which we thought was complimentary but once we recieved our bill, I saw that he charged me for it. So I politely asked him why wasn't the cake complimentary? And he replied in a nasty manner that, ""if it was like that, it would be everyone's birthday."" I told him well that's why you check the ID to make sure. He shrugged his shoulders and stormed off. Then had the audacity to charge gratuity on the bill.

Chili's is literally 5 minutes from my home and Mexican is my all-time favorite food.  So you've got to screw-up royally for me to complain.  This Chili's is located next to the Pompano Centre Mall. If you're in the area, you are MUCH better off eating at the Whole Foods which is a block away.  The tacos were very soggy and the chicken tasted cheap and tasteless.  The rice was bland and soggy too.  Didn't think it was possible to mess up a taco... well Surprise!  I've had Taco Bell that tasted better. Oh, and I almost forgot to mention that I stood around for 15 minutes before anyone in the carry out area acknowledged my presence.  I finally had to flag someone down and say ""Hey, can someone please help me?""  And then I proceeded to wait another 5 minutes before they came back.  All that and the food still sucked.   I'm so sad, so bad, so long Chili's.

I first noticed them grabbing the forks by the top where your mouth goes, then messing with their phones then i see another staff member bringing them food but to top it off, after eating she licks her finger AND grabs the forks from the top again! That was just it, i called the manager over and she apologized and said she would speak to them, she immediately sat and spoke to them right in front of us, which was not the right approach to do it while we were still sitting waiting for our food. The manager herself tried to reason it by saying that the napkin/utensils we were about to use were wrapped in the morning by someone that does just that all mornings. Like that was suppose to make us feel any better ? For all i care this person could do just the same and eat her breakfast while doing it or not be using gloves and touch the forks and knifes with their bare dirty hands.

We got there and found a parking spot right away, they have a decent size lot. We walked in and we're told 10/15min of wait. We were okay with this especially because you could tell it was a busy night.  The hostess sat us in less then 5min. She was friendly and when we sat down my mom and I had realized that it was either a really new location for they had just remodeled. We figured this's because it was clean and cool.  Our waitress greeted us promptly and was super sweet! I can't remember her name but she was super consistent and polite. And she used to work at chick-fil-a and we could tell because she kept saying ""my pleasure"" my whole family loved her.  We ordered quest dip which was really good. This is probably my favorite appetizer there, I always order it. However I hate the salsa that comes with the chips. It looks like tomato soup because it is so watery.  For main course I had the half rack ribs with house BBQ sauce and loaded mashed potatoes. The overall was a 9 out of 10. The robs were cooked to perfection and the flavor was really nice. The loaded mashed was just okay for me. Maybe I've just been blessed with getting homemade mashed too often.  We also got the raspberry cobbler with ice cream for dessert! It's so cute it came in a baby skillet, which for me presentation is half the battle. The hot lit and berries mixed with the cold vanilla bean ice cream was awesome.

When you walk in it feels like home, even when it's your 1st time at that specific location. The mood is so cozy and happy. The place is clean, always has a nice full house to keep the mood high. I really enjoy their drinks, they don't cheap and skimp you out at all. When you ask to try something new they even say if you don't like it they will replace it. That's great service that makes you want to come back. I always put a separate paragraph for the bathrooms because that is important. The ladies room is always fully stocked and nicely clean.

Part of makes our experience amazing is the bar tender Ryan.  He's very good at what he does, he's always smiling, knows how we like our food. You never have to think twice with him. His service is amazing and he always puts a smile on our faces.  I really believe that they should do some type of recognition for him.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pompano-beach,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
3,Chris W.,"Dallas, TX",59,30,5.0,2.0,2017-07-25,"I made a wrong turn today that put me in close proximity to this Chili's and I decided i would roll the dice and see what's new & exciting. I can honestly say I would buy the southwest egg rolls by the bucket. I'd buy the avocado ranch that comes as a dip in a barrel and fill my bath tub with it.  So why is it every time I order an entree, I make a wrong turn at Albuquerque and end up miserable in the end? Tonight's contender were the update fajitas with shrimp and ""prime rib"" smothered in queso.  Now when I hear prime rib I think steak. I think juicy. What I don't normally conjure up is some little chunks of meat like you'd find in Dinty Moore Beef Stew. Yup - that shit in a can. The shrimp was marginally better, dancing precariously on the line between ready to eat and ready to put on display because someone sprayed them with shellac.  You would think given the time I had between appetizer and entree that something magical was happening in the kitchen. No really - like child birth or something because it was so long I wondered if she even ordered my meal. I was just about to put an APB out for my cilantro rice when it landed on my table.  I found that the more I tried to eat, the less appetizing everything was over all. It was either some sort of Dinty Moore induced chemical reaction with the ""loaded"" queso or some other circumstances I will leave to the EPA to fully explain.  Unfortunately (or fortunately) this meal had a shelf life of zero in my body, and soon after I started my drive home I felt like Segorney Weaver in insert alien movie here and had to make an unscheduled landing at the McDonalds down the street.  So how does grade D meat and uncontrollable gut punches still prove worthy of two stars? - my server was extremely nice and attentive even if the food took forever. - you can pay at the table with the ZIOSK - which means I don't have to stop the server to get the check and go through all that nonsense. - I got plenti rewards for my efforts, which is suppose is some consolation for being up in the bathroom for half the night.  All in all I would say Chili's made my no Fly zone list with this visit. I guess I'll have to find another way to get those southwest egg rolls and avocado ranch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pompano-beach,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6
2,Mariana D.,"Deerfield Beach, FL",28,5,1.0,1.0,2017-07-30,"My fiancé and I have always liked this place. We actually go a lot to have dinner but tonight there was ONE waitress for a whole area. She took our drinks order and took 12 minutes to come back with water (my fiancé ordered a beer) and asked ""what was you beer again?"" Seriously? We left and no one said a word.  Awesome customer service, especially with people who go to their restaurant every weekend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pompano-beach,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
1,Ednei C.,"Pompano Beach, FL",0,1,,1.0,2017-10-13,"was on chilis today october  friday 13 with my family. I was very disappointed because we order 2 dinners for 2 as usual. we always order the fajita because we love so much, and always come with rice and beans without any questions.And tonight when they serve us our plates come with no rice and no beans at all.We ask the waitress about and she said that special 2 for $20 doesn't come with rice and beans, we said we always receive the full plate with no complaints, and she said they give us the wrong plate....She call the manager and she said the same..for rice and beans we have the order separate on fajita.We return our plates and leave the restaurant,not because the price ,but the  manager sucks and looks like don't know how to run a restaurant business...because a $4 dollars she loose 2 clientes and almost $70 dollars on food and tips....I'm very very disappointed .....  note:the manager name tonight was Paula.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pompano-beach,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
