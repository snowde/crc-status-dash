3,Troy P.,"Portland, TX",36,58,189.0,2.0,2012-09-13,"Is it Chili's or Jack in the Box?  I can't tell anymore.  I sure don't get a ""dinning experience"" out of this restaraunt.  It feels so much like a slightly darker fast food joint.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-portland-2?start=20,,,,,
1,Tara H.,"Corpus Christi, TX",14,28,,3.0,2013-02-22,"Have you ever been to a restaurant that had a bunch of open tables, ant they tell you 15 mins and your the only one on the list, yep it pissed me off and we walked out. Train you seating staff better, you should never allow that, as I was pulling away I seen another group walk in and out for the same reason. What is up? They get 3 stars because I know if the manager seen it they wouldn't have allowed it. Could have and should have had immediate seating, about 8 to 10 tables were empty that would have fit us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-portland-2?start=20,,,,,
4,Frank F.,"Aransas Pass, TX",0,9,1.0,1.0,2013-08-31,Tonight the service sucked!  The server seemed to disappear regularly and several times we caught other servers to actually help us. My guests from our of town were not impressed,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-portland-2?start=20,,,,,
25,Austin C.,"Rockport, TX",0,10,1.0,4.0,2014-05-06,"Beer was cold and bacon cheese burger was a bacon cheese burger. Nothing fancy but Chili's isn't a fancy, gourmet place. They have new automated check out machines at the tables that allow you to reorder drinks without waiting on the wait staff, A++++",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-portland-2,,,,,
5,Judy D.,"Victoria, TX",0,3,,1.0,2014-06-22,"The service at the Portland Chillis was horrible!  We received our bill at our table, but they lost our order.  When we asked why our food was taking so long was when we found out it hadn't been started.  The waitress thought the manager came to our table, but he never showed up.  We had to go find him to see if our food was coming or not.  Our bill was not adjusted until we asked.  The manager never came to our table.  We know mistakes happen, but Chillis didn't handle the situation well at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-portland-2?start=20,,,,,
18,Tom H.,"Corpus Christi, TX",51,173,95.0,2.0,2014-07-19,"Standard Chili's fare.  However, the service was terribly lacking.  It took quite a while for anyone to show up to take our drink order...then a long wait again for her to show up with said order.  We got a pair of hamburgers and like everything on the Chili's menu, they were pricier than hey should be.  The sound level inside was uncomfortable which made conversation difficult. The burgers were just OK, the service was painstaking and the atmosphere where simple conversation was made difficult because of the volume of music and the waitstaff shrieking to one another from across the room take three full stars off this review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-portland-2,,,,,
23,Amber U.,"Port Isabel, TX",48,35,40.0,3.0,2014-11-21,"When they are good they are spot on, but when they are bad, it's miserable. Hit or miss. Dined here several times and the good outweighs the bad. Typical chain. Gotta love those shrimp tacos.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-portland-2,,,,,
22,Kristy L.,"Corpus Christi, TX",381,10,,5.0,2015-03-27,Would love for someone to give a high five to Shannon. She is the hostess. Always happy and a great smile. Plus she is busy cleaning tables and making sure everyone is ok better than the servers.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-portland-2,,,,,
14,Alissette Q.,"Corpus Christi, TX",1,6,4.0,1.0,2015-04-28,"Disgusting ""new smoked wings"" were brought out to us and they were raw and almost white looking with absolutely no seasoning on it and was 100% not like the picture showed. It was the most disgusting thing I've ever seen and will NEVER go back. Manager came out to tell us that ""the reason why they looked like that was because they weren't smoked....ummmm the menus advertises a juicy dark seasoned ""SMOKED WINGS"". It was ridiculous. Giving Chilis this one star  is too much credit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-portland-2,,,,,
15,Alyssa P.,"Katy, TX",2,48,86.0,1.0,2015-06-27,"Avoid like a plague. HORRIBLE! BEYOND DISAPPOINTED. Rude, unprofessional manager, and did not even care that food was taking forever & that people before us were getting their food before us. Waited at least an hour for sure that i know of. He made jokes about it taking forever and just laughed and walked away. Finally told them that we didnt want our food anymore and he didnt care just walked away again. I have never been addressed like this esp. by a manager of the store. And than to top it off there was a loud bang sounded like dishes falling and I was definitely scared that they would just put the food back on the plate.   They should care for their customers and at least do their best to make them happy. What a way to ruin a good weekend. We asked the host for the manager's name and she did not want to give us his name. Like really? She acted like she didnt know. Go elsewhere. Dont waste your time. Appetizer and drinks were free but i am glad bc i wouldn't have paid anyways.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-portland-2,,,,,

24,Stephanie M.,"Rockport, TX",0,2,,1.0,2015-11-23,Decided to try the to go option and when I got there 10 minutes before the order was supposed to be ready it was already sitting there cold. Like it was left over from the night before. Horrible! Never again! Very disappointed!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-portland-2,,,,,
19,Alonzo R.,"Taft, TX",35,4,,5.0,2016-01-04,I had dinner last night here.  We had the $35 dinner and drinks special.  You get 2 president margaritas an appetizer 2 dinner entrees and a dessert.  Everything was delicious.  The waitress was very friendly and attentive to us.  I will definitely go back for dinner and drinks.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-portland-2,,,,,
17,Drew L.,"Port Lavaca, TX",1,4,,3.0,2016-02-27,Waiters are snotty. Didn't like the overall dining environment. Chicken was undercooked and the macaroni was too spicy. I was personally dragged by the waitress. Will not be returning.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-portland-2,,,,,
16,Joyce W.,"Richardson, TX",1,57,13.0,2.0,2016-05-27,"I wanted to give this restaurant 3 stars because I usually like the Chili's chain restaurants.  Like their food, ambiance, but wait!  That was in DFW, not Portland, Texas!  Horrible management!  Have had good shrimp tacos, margaritas, and passable service in the past, but today at lunch, I came out ""steamed""!!  I decided to go on the bar side and the hostess told me fine to do so.  There were open tables though not cleared off and half the bar was open.  I chose a table and nicely moved the dirty dishes. and tip to the edge.  After a few minutes, a hurried and frowning bartender/waitress?? came over.  She began picking up the dirty dishes and said grumpily, ""We're on a wait list now and aren't able to serve you"".  I was shocked, and said, ""Well, the hostess didn't tell me that"".  Whew, made me mad!  Sure, people were waiting.  That's why I went to the bar where there were empty tables and barstools!!!! MANAGEMENT PLEASE!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-portland-2,,,,,
13,Norm B.,"Kapolei, HI",10,166,125.0,3.0,2016-06-17,"Went for lunch, which was very busy with business folks but was seated and served quickly. Great service that produced great salads from the kitchen. No static was offered over the request to split the checks ... thank you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-portland-2,,,,,
11,Mike R.,"Midland, TX",2,66,13.0,1.0,2016-07-02,"Had lunch here today. I ordered the Margarita Chicken. The dinner salad was crisp, cold and tasty.  The Margarita Chicken was fair, to say the least. Pale white meat with no sign of grilling. Oh wait!!, i just remembered. I purchased the same frozen chicken breasts fully cooked at HEB! Identical...more than likely microwaved.  To add insult to injury, the waitress stopped by long enough to tell me to take the survey and 'just put 5 stars on everything'. No Class.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-portland-2,,,,,
20,Melissa P.,"Port Aransas, TX",0,15,4.0,1.0,2016-07-09,"Wasn't expecting amazing service. Expectation was to receive your average service, the kind we normally get and tolerate. There really wasn't any service at all. They took the order, the kitchen delivered the meal, the waitress never came back. The tip really belonged to the kitchen if you ask me.... Even though key ingredients where left out of the salad. It was just a poor experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-portland-2,,,,,
9,Donald L.,"Braman, OK",4,16,12.0,4.0,2016-11-05,"Wonderful meal, Leslie was our waitress and took very good care of us, attentive, polite, friendly and helpful in choosing our meal.     What would be ""interesting"" to learn is, while dining I noticed a table being cleared. It didn't completely have my attention as well, it's a table being cleared. What I did notice was the hostess wiping down the table then taking the ""rag"" back to the hostess station where it laid with several others on top of the fire extinguisher. Obviously I miss something, right?!?!?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-portland-2,,,,,
12,Bill L.,"Sinton, TX",0,7,,1.0,2017-04-15,"Same old same old. Long wait time, poor quality food. No obvious food QA before being served. No manager around either. 3rd try, pitiful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-portland-2,,,,,
8,C P.,"Bedford, TX",2,35,1.0,2.0,2017-06-04,"I usually like Chilli's but this location is RIDICULOUS I ordered online and went to get the order about 40 minutes after. I rushed afraid I was late, guess what when I got there... I had to wait about 10 minutes for my order to be brought up, and not only that. It was not the correct order, so I'm here sitting typing this review while hey re-do an online order which they had way more time than required to complete.  I understand you can goof off at work sometimes while you are working to keep your sanity, but these people while I was waiting were joking and messing around. Look if you guys can't multi task then either quit, or just do once thing at once, that should solve the issue. Customers are not the most important thing in your life, but at least act like it while you are at the job. All of you working there right now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-portland-2,,,,,
7,Kaci C.,"Spring, TX",49,47,27.0,3.0,2017-08-08,"It was ok. The food took a very long time, but it was decent. The staff was very friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-portland-2,,,,,
10,Travis W.,"Corpus Christi, TX",28,11,,4.0,2017-09-01,"The best thing about Chili's is probably the price. Also, their menu is versatile enough that everyone can find something they'll love. For these reasons, it is a great place for a big group or for an occasional hangout. They must be prioritizing my food, because I don't usually have complaints about the wait, though there have been occasions. 4 stars because they're not perfect, but above average in every way. Applebee's is the closest alternative, and their food is more expensive for lower quality.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-portland-2,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
6,Merry E.,"Portland, TX",37,21,4.0,3.0,2017-10-17,Best thing about this place is their chips and salsa and happy hour other than that I don't really like their food,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-portland-2,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
