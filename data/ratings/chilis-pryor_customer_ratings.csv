7,John M.,"Sapulpa, OK",29,48,18.0,4.0,2013-07-01,"Typical Chili's. good burger, good prices. Had a slow waitress but thanks to good company we didn't really notice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pryor,,,,,
6,Crystal D.,"Owasso, OK",28,21,,2.0,2013-12-03,"I haven't eaten at chili's in some time since it's always the same old thing. Took my son to dinner here a week ago and they actually had some new and tasty looking items on the menu!  I tried a flatbread pizza entree with chicken and avocado and it was delicious. While we waited for our food, we were able to try the digital kiosk which they now have at each table. It wasn't until I got our bill that I realized some of the games on the kiosk cost money.  Overall I wouldn't say it was worth $35 for a small dinner for two and sodas.  Service was sub par.  Won't be playing the kiosk again if we return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pryor,,,,,

But isn't that how it normally goes? Lol",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pryor,,,,,
8,Clair J.,"Springfield, IL",1,93,3.0,2.0,2015-07-06,"We were traveling through and stopped for lunch. The hostess desk in the front was very dirty and cluttered. It was not busy by any means but we were told to wait, politely though, and she cleaned off a table so we were assuming that is the one we would be seated at, but she continued to clean probably 4 more. We were seated and the tv was playing a hotdog eating contest. NOT what I want to see when I'm trying to enjoy my meal. There were 3 flies swarming around and the windows were very dirty. I had very low expectations then. The waitress was nice but service was extremely slow. We are from a big city where restaurants are always busy and the wait is never 45 minutes for a salad and burger. Once we got the food though I was surprised how good my salad was. My husband doused his burger and fries in salt and said it was pretty soggy and not flavorful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pryor,,,,,
5,Justin K.,"Pryor Creek, OK",28,18,10.0,4.0,2015-08-11,"Me and my fianc√© love chilis restaurants. We have ate at a ton of them. This one is a hit and miss on how the customer service is and food quality. I can say I have never had my order messed up but sometimes it just wasn't to great of quality in the taste. Chips and salsa is always awesome as always with and chilis. Has been updated looks nice, could use some cleaning here and there...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pryor,,,,,
10,Julie L.,"Irving, TX",33,4,,1.0,2015-09-28,"Chili's was dirty, service very slow and the food was terrible!! Fried pickles were awful and the salad was old lettuce and had a string after taste! Could not eat it!! Not sure I will ever go to a Chilis again after this experience! Paid $36.00 for food we could not eat that took over an hour to prepare!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pryor,,,,,
9,Richard R.,"Tyler, TX",0,22,1.0,3.0,2015-10-10,"Food was OK. (Typical Chilis Chain Good) The server brought the wrong soup, and was not very prompt. Our ticket was given to another customer who paid it and left. The server said he couldn't reopen the ticket and just gave us the other customers bill to pay. We had to press him to see our own bill in order to determine that we were not overpaying!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pryor,,,,,
4,Dustin S.,"Pryor Creek, OK",6,10,,5.0,2015-10-25,"Love this place. Can count on one hand the number of issues I have one but those few times don't lower the fact that I always receive great service and great food. I don't see a lot of management attention on the floor, there used to be a woman name lori that worked there she was awesome but she left I believe but the good experiences have continued.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pryor,,,,,
2,Lesa F.,"Russell, KS",310,270,765.0,2.0,2016-05-02,This is the lowest star rating I have given any Chilis and we have eaten at quite a few across the US We drive a truck across all 48 states  Not busy at all tonight  However our server was very slow with drinks and refills  Ordered a second glass of wine ... 15 minutes later she come told us they were out .... Come back 15 min later to see if I wanted anything else to drink ... Didn't do it the first time  We decided to order dessert to go. She come by my husband told her want he wanted she walks away ... I had to yell at her to tell her I wanted a dessert too .... Really .... Wow. Who trains these people here anyway ??? Menu has changed again like most however this time we noticed the portions are smaller .... Food was good but the rice was under cooked and crunchy I would tell you how dessert was however we are still here waiting on it 20 minutes later ..... Tick Tick Tick Wow Chilis your slipping at this location to say the least  We will never come back here  You should be ashamed,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pryor,,,,,
1,Sandra B.,"Afton, OK",28,9,46.0,2.0,2017-02-01,"Food: decent  Service: poor  It was nice to walk in and be seated right away. Once we sat down we waited about ten minutes and no one approached the the table, greeted us or took our drink orders. The manager happened to be standing at the front of the restaurant so my husband approached her and let her know we still had not had our drink orders taken. After that service got a little better, there were a few things forgotten with my order that we had to ask for again. My husband really liked his chicken sandwich. I got the ribs and they were just ok, but the chips and guacamole were very good. Overall the experience was just ok, the manager did give us complementary drinks which was nice. Unfortunately there are not many other options in this area so hopefully they get better with time. For now I would recommend sticking with their Tex mex options and you will be good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-pryor,,,,,
