Maybe it's the bartender/server that we have come to know, or the fact that they have big beers for cheap, I don't know.  I always get the same thing which, now that I think about it, I don't even know the name. It's a sampler of sorts. Couple that with two big beers, and you've got a pretty good start (or end) to the night.  Not sure what everyone likes, but I'd suggest going to the bar area.

I'm not sure I've had a single dining experience when I didn't have to send something back for being overcooked, undercooked, soggy, or just not good.  The atmosphere is ""meh"" at best, noisy & greasy feeling - typical low end bar & grill restaurant chain ambiance.

40,Jon B.,"Raleigh, NC",97,238,164.0,4.0,2014-12-03,"As far as chain restaurants go, Chili's is probably one of my favorites. I don't go a whole lot, but always enjoy it when I do. The service and the food  I've had at this location have always been very good. Chicken crispers and any appetizer that comes with their chips are always a win for me. I tried one of their new fresh mex bowls on my last visit. Very good, but it is basically it is a burrito bowl. They now have these touch screen menus on the table. We didn't use it much, but I was intrigued by the idea. I guess if the server you get isn't too great you can minimize them by using that. Overall it's chain tex-mex. If that's your thing Chili's is a decent option. If not, you can hop over to some Italian right nearby.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-raleigh-7,2.32,2.32,2.32,2.32,2.32

A table of 4 next to us came in AFTER us and were served their food before the two of us.  My husband's steak was ordered medium and came back super well done.  Their chicken flatbread was  greasy mess that I ordered.  We talked to the manager and got his meal comped but would never return to this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-raleigh-7?start=20,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003

Plenty of sauce on he pasta and the grilled chicken was seasoned perfectly! Black beans and rice that came with the grilled chicken were flavorful and the perfect accompaniment!

33,Aaron B.,"Raleigh, NC",171,130,58.0,3.0,2015-10-21,"This review covers multiple visits. The service is generally good here unless you visit within an hour of closing and get seated anywhere but the bar area.  Good luck getting a server to pay attention to your needs as you won't be able to find one.  This happened one night when I came in with a guest and we wanted to chat without fighting over the bar noise.  Server apparently had been tasked with multiple 'closing' chores and was absent for 90% of our visit.  What compounded this problem was that the convenient table-top ordering kiosk was conveniently missing.  That night was so memorable that even on subsequent visits, if that particular server is there, that night will be mentioned with some humor and apologies and extra effort paid.  So...... in essence the issue was mostly fixed. The food. Well... here's the tough part of that.  This food is nearly exactly what you'd find in any similar style restaraunt.  Some good, some bad.  The new dishes are rolled out regularly but none really stand out enough to become a 'standard' order.  I normally stick with the Cajun chicken pasta or a old-time cheeseburger and am generally happy with that.. but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit to have them.  The one thing that will continue bringing me in is sadly one of the same things I can find elsewhere.... the molten cake w/ice cream dessert.  The Chili's version of the Oreo cake deserves a special mention and I suggest you the reader go get one while they are still there.  Oh.. on some visits, if you're lucky, the fries are just........ awesome. What really gives a solid three rating is the Chili's rewards system that gives you points per dollar you spend.  You can use your accumulated points to receive a free beverage or dessert or entree if you have enough.  It's a nice thing to take a look at your check and realize you have enough points to get a $7 dessert to top your meal off for free. Will I be back?  Likely.  Will you?  Probably. Happy eats!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-raleigh-7,,,,,
38,Jan W.,"Raleigh, NC",2,42,25.0,2.0,2015-11-07,"It's been a while, but last night we went to Chili's at the Triangle Town Center for a quick meal.  The staff was quite friendly, but it seemed to be a place a mass confusion when we arrived.  People were standing around waiting for a table not knowing if they would be seated immediately or if there was a significant wait.  Once we got our table, a friendly waiter came around and took our order... then we waited and waited. There were people who arrived after us and they got their appetizers long before ours.  When the first batch of chips were delivered, they were sudo hot-cold and greasy, but immediately he came back with a second batch that looked much better.  When our check arrived, (and I advise, get into the habit of scrutinizing your bill) things were added all up wrong which resulted in an over-charge.  Still friendly, our waiter dashed off to correct the mistake and came back with an adjusted tab.  Overall, I would say the meal was, well, okay, not special.  The service definitely friendly, but could use some more training.  Based on last night's experience, it may be a while before our next return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-raleigh-7,,,,,
11,Adrienne D.,"Raleigh, NC",0,17,5.0,3.0,2015-11-19,"I stopped in for lunch today. Had the nacho appetizer and one of their new burgers (sweet and Smokey). The nachos were a little soggy and stuck together so when you picked one up, it took the toppings off another. The burger was pretty good...had crispy onion rings on top...yum! The only problem, other than soggy nachos, was the ticket times. Nachos took close to 15 minutes and then our burgers took another 15 or 20. I have noticed it is hard to go here when I only have an hour lunch break. I always order a side salad instead of French fries...and this is the ONLY time I've never had an offer for the salad to come out first, which is my preference. I guess I should have mentioned, that but I assumed it would. I was looking for our server to ask for the salads, but could never locate her until the burger and salad came out.

The chips appeared to be house made, along with the sauce. But it was really, really watery. The manager said it normally looks that way, so I wouldn't recommend ordering it, ever in that case.  For the kids meal we ordered a Mac n Cheese, but then later the manager came out and stated they didn't have any Mac n Cheese. Then I ordered the Crispy Chicken Dippers. When it came out I was a little disappointed. It looked like they took a couple of chicken strips, and just cut them in tiny pieces after it was cooked. Plus they didn't bring any dipping sauce with the chicken DIPPERS. The pieces were cut too small to dip as well.  With the steaks, the steak was ordered medium, but it was brought back well done, no pink anywhere. The second steak was brought back very medium rare. Just to make sure I wasn't misjudging it I asked the manager, who even stated it was medium rare, so they threw it back on the grill to cook it more.  With the other steak, it was cooked just right, but the taste and texture was so bad I had to ask for some A1 Steak Sauce. A good steak should be good in its own, and shouldn't need a mask or anything to cover up with the natural taste and flavor of the meat.  With the server at the end, he kept the itemized receipt, and then acted like it was a problem when I wanted the itemized receipt, instead of just the credit card receipt. Plenty of people keep the itemized receipt, it could have been a business expense or something. When he brought back the original itemized receipt, he had to unball it, as he tossed it in the trash. Don't trash my receipt without asking me first. If I leave it on the table, then you can trash it. If I am still there, and paying you, then please allow me the option to keep it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-raleigh-7,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16
