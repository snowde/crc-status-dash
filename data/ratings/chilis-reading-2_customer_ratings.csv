2,Amy D.,"Brighton, MA",58,37,25.0,4.0,2012-05-29,"I have a weakness for Chili's to begin with, so I expect to always have a strong opinion about my visits to these places either way. This Chili's in Reading has a busy bar scene, but that may be because the only 2 times I've been there have been close to Xmas so there are more people out anyway.  The female bartender who is there I think mon-thu is excellent. She handles the regulars like a seasoned bartender, and some of them need it. They all love her though. Her service is great and friendly. The first time i went in we joked about being the only women in the bar. I ordered a beer, and she suggested a different beer that was on special, which I appreciated (although I didn't take her up on the suggestion). Actually, the second time I went in, the bar was packed and she remembered me right away, and I was actually glad to see her!   The food comes out quickly and as ordered ( I am unfortunately the kind of a-hole customer who never just orders anything as it is on the menu).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-reading-2?start=40,2.512,2.512,2.512,2.512,2.5120000000000005
41,June D.,"Woburn, MA",1,66,,2.0,2012-08-12,"I would have given 1 1/2 stars, but not allowed to.  Anyway, my husband and I were in the mood for a burger, and several people raved about Chili's being awesome and cooked the way you like it - NOT!! It clearly states on the menu that burgers are cooked medium, or else to your specification . Our waittress, who was very nice and informative, asked us how we like our burgers cooked. I told her medium rare, and hubby likes his medium. They both came out like hockey pucks!  More on the medium well/well side.  Barely edible at best. Come on, why is it that so many restaurants have trouble cooking a burger, other than well done?  We will never go back and will pass on to anyone asking our recommendation not to get burgers there.  On a side note, next to us was a young couple with their toddler sitting in a high chair. They put his food directly on the table, not on a plate/napkin - we were stunned!  With all the news about bacteria, etc., they should have been more careful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-reading-2?start=60,2.216,2.216,2.216,2.216,2.216

46,Nancy D.,"Wakefield, MA",134,28,1.0,4.0,2013-08-01,"My husband doesn't like chain restaurants, but Chili's is okay with him. I think he likes the tall beers and margaritas. But enough about him. I usually come in for lunch, although I have had more than a few diners here too . The lunch specials are great and the food is better than average. The servers are attentive and helpful when it comes to ingredients and how things are prepared. One time I wanted to try the cookie in a skillet dessert but asked if I could get it crispy instead of chewy and was informed that since they microwave the cookie, there is really no way to make it crispy. I said that was fine, but a minute later, the server was back to say they were going to try it in the oven. Well, she was back a few minutes later to tell me that it hadn't gone well, so they were going to just prepare one the usual way, which turned out to be fine. I did appreciate everyone trying to get me something the way I requested it, and had to laugh at the updates. I also enjoy the Presidente Margarita and enjoy watching the servers shake-shake-shake my margarita (extra points for panache!). My favorites are the Quesadilla Explosion Salad and the chicken tortilla soup. The burgers are decent but stay away from the chicken strips and many of the fried things as they come out super greasy. Oh, I almost forgot my most favorite thing - the Southwest Eggrolls are awesome! Sure, maybe a little greasy, but they are served with a lovely ranch-y dipping sauce and heartburn be damned, they are yummy! Glasses for water and soda are large so you don't have to pester your server for refills very often, but refills are free. What else to say? I guess that I have dined at quite a few Chili's and found them to be pretty generic. The extra star for this review is for the staff at the Reading location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-reading-2?start=20,3.08,3.08,3.08,2.416,3.0800000000000005

My hotel was in the next town over, and I was hungry. Having been to most of the places around that area, I was in the mood for something different. Looked up this place on Google, and even used their website to place my order.  Ordered the 6oz sirloin, medium well, with an order of shrimp, side of mushrooms and loaded mashed potatoes. Usually comes to $20 or so. The site said it'd be ready in about 15-20 minutes, more than enough time to drive over there. It was ready by the time I got there. The girl at the station was bubbly and polite, which was nice. The food itself was decent. The steak was still juicy and I just love shrimp...they weren't overcooked!

I want there last night.  I have not been there in years.  Let me tell you, I have not missed much.  I spend almost 30 dollars for food and drinks just on myself.  That would have been fine in most situations.  But when the steak with avocado is only a six oz steak, avocado is extra, the nachos only have like 10 on the plate with cheese, and you get 2 shorties with a beer selection that is small and not that great, you've spend of few dollars more than you should have.  Maybe the fajita's are still good, but the price and quality is rather disappointing. I don't know what to say only that there are so many other good bar and grills around.  This place used to be at the top of the list, but not anymore.  Thank god this place has a good location or it probably would be out of business compared to some of the other places around.  Three stars is ok overall, but when you consider places like Buffalo Wild Wings with their big screens and Yard House with their beer selection, who really cares about Chili's?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-reading-2?start=20,3.08,3.08,3.08,2.284,3.0800000000000005
7,Bonnie G.,"Wakefield, MA",0,13,,2.0,2015-01-19,"Normally I love Chili's but last night myself and two friend met at Chili's in Reading. Our server was very forceful and mildly-rude. My friend, who just a baby, ordered the guacamole burger and when it came the guacamole was full of jalapenos, which made it way too spicy to eat and far too spicy to pass on to a baby. After much debate, in not wanting the complain we found the first server we saw and asked if we could send back the burger, the server was more than willing to do this. I'm glad for this. However, then our server came out and said, ""too spicy, what do you mean too spicy?"" Which again, was fairly intense. We explained and she left. Then at the end of the meal, with half a burger and nearly all my fires on my plate she started to take my food away. Until I looked at her, then she asked if I needed a to go box. What happen to asking if I was done or if I wanted dessert, we clearly still chatting. Then she came back again reached across my face and my plate to my friends plate and took it EVEN though my I was mid-bite of a fry.

Should that be the case for visiting this Reading location you will get a meal for a good value (only hotel in walking distance is the Clarion Inn). They are in range of Uber too.  For beer they offer a dozen beers in 16 or 22 Oz glasses,  only two local beers - - this really is a Bud or Coors light kinda place.  On this visit I chose their new soft tacos. You can choose a combination,  in my case I chose Pork,  Shrimp,  and Tilapia.  The shrimp and pork are sure bets. Also the Pico de Gallo (fresh salsa) is what made these Tacos.  As for negatives the fish was a bit watery.  Also the accompanying rice was undercooked and dry with no seasoning.   The black beans were alright and had some spice. Beer is cheap,  3.29 for 22oz makes it the cheapest bar in the area.   But it does close early and I have heard from others that they do a 2-3 drink max as corporate policy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-reading-2,2.96,2.96,2.96,2.48,2.96

We started with the fried asparagus without any jalapeños because my wife and I don't really like spicy food. It was okay but it didn't stand out. I thought there would be a little more flavor.  We also had the Texas fries! These were awesome! Lots of bacon and melted cheese. I would recommend this for an app over the fried asparagus.  My wife had the guacamole burger. It was unevenly cooked. Half the burger was medium rare and half was medium well. That said she still ate the whole thing. One note about the presentation: don't put a small/ medium sized burger on a large plate. The scaling throws off the presentation and makes it seem smaller than it actually is.  I had the ribs! I thought they were solid! The meat fell off the bone and the sauce was just spicy enough. I really enjoyed them. Our server Kim was really friendly and she kept our drinks full!

20,1776 Real Estate R.,"Londonderry, NH",12,16,3.0,4.0,2017-08-03,"For main stream Resturaunt's they do have some of the best buffalo wings ever consumed.  Their queso again goes unmatched through anywhere I have tried in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Dessert , the molten lava cake is in my top 5 for desserts.  Chips and salsa are ok, generic at best. The sliders are descent.   They don't excel at a lot on on the menu, but these items are some of the ones that stand out.  Staff has always been great! Management is excellent too, they donate to charity when they can.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-reading-2,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6
21,P H.,"Wakefield, MA",0,186,1.0,2.0,2017-11-27,"Friendly service, food came out fast. Burger tasted like McDonalds. Fries were seasoned nicely, a little over salted, and I wasn't a big fan of the soft style - I prefer crispy. The ketchup at the table was out so I had to go get a full ketchup from another table. The clam chowder was excellent, thick broth, with lots of clams and potatoes. The crispy chicken tenders looked good. Two stars since I didn't really enjoy my entree.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-reading-2,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
