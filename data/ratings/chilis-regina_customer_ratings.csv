4,Lisa P.,"Calgary, Canada",77,262,135.0,1.0,2012-09-11,"Total disappointment! I was in Regina for a couple of days staying nearby at the Holiday Inn. One night I walked over to Chili's for a bellini. Last time I was in town and ate here I had one that was amazing. Not tonight. They changed their recipe and now it's a bland peach not slushy drink and had no sangria in it. So I asked for a frozen raspberry margarita. Even worse! It had this big black gob in it and when I asked what the hell it was, waitress said it's vanilla bean. WTF?? Who puts vanilla in their margarita? Chili's that's who. So she made me one without vanilla. I couldn't drink it because it was so sweet, just like syrup. I told the waitress this was a complete disaster and I didn't want any of these awful drinks. Left thirsty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-regina,,,,,
6,JP S.,"Alpharetta, GA",0,23,,2.0,2013-04-05,Not impressed.  I figured being a chain it would be similar to the Chili's we love down South but not at all the same.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-regina,,,,,
3,Jill H.,"Regina, Canada",0,23,,1.0,2015-11-07,The steak I ordered was disgusting.  The only good thing about this place was the waiter did a good job and was always around filling up water.  Which I need lots of to get through my leather shoe of a steak.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-regina,,,,,
1,Jarvis D.,"Nipawin, Canada",8,2,3.0,5.0,2016-06-25,"Went out for lunch as a family before a wedding.  Lemon waters, excellent food and great service.  My daughter loves Chilis and ordered spinach queso dip and loved it.  Definitely will go back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-regina,,,,,
2,Benjamin M.,"South Summerlin, Las Vegas, NV",1,28,1.0,1.0,2016-08-06,The bartender is not good.  He's more interested with what is on tv and the employees hanging out at the bar than he is of the paying patron.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-regina,,,,,
0,D S.,"Winnipeg, Canada",1,15,3.0,3.0,2016-09-10,"Nothing fancy, but it gets the job done. And I always think having the managers bring out the food is a nice touch, it says ""we care"".  Food was mediocre. I hate when I order a rice bowl and they clearly use uncle bens instant rice, but again... We were hungry and the food was decent enough. Better than fast food anyway.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-regina,,,,,
