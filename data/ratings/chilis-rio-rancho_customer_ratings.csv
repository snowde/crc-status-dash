7,Maricarmen P.,"Rio Rancho, NM",73,25,16.0,1.0,2013-07-18,"We wanted to have a little celebration dinner and our girls chose Chili's.  We've always had pretty good experiences at Chili's RR - until a recent previous visit when our sirloin was over cooked - twice - but that time the customer service response from management was quick and caring.   This time, we ordered a quesadilla and a chicken fajita from the 2 for $20 menu in addition to the Texas fries.  The appetizer took about 20 minutes to arrive (which in little hungry girl time is about 40 minutes).  The fries and cheese were cold - seemed like it had already sat there for a while - but tasty enough to eat.  We're not that picky and we were hungry so we gulped them down.   The entrees didn't come until 1/2 an hour after the appetizer was FINISHED - the waitress did go by the table 3 times to tell us our food was ""almost ready"", but did not refill the girls drinks or offer anything else.  When it finally came, it was a train wreck.  The fajitas had an off smoked smell that was empowering over the usually nice delicious smell of the chicken.  Chicken was colorless and bland - tasted like that smoke smell.  On top of that, the quesadillas were cold and seemed to have been fried instead of sautéed.  They were crispy, cold and greasy.  The girls pepperoni pizza tasted out of a box, a bit dodgy even for a 7-year-old, but I don't expect chillis to be tossing fresh pizza out.  Her fries never came out.  Mac and cheese and broccoli were shared by the girls.   Their drinks were never refilled.   The waitress didn't come around much, so we had to flag her down from another table to ask her if the quesadillas were supposed to be fried and whether they were smoking the fajitas.  Her reaction was lifeless, like she already knew, she replied ""oh do you want something else?"" without the slightest bit of concern, blank face.  Honestly by that time we were ready to leave.  Took away our plates no apologies and left.  Then she had another waiter deliver the check with an $8.50 discount - still no apologies or explanation.  Like a hand out - just added insult to injury. So we ended paying $25 plus tip for slow service, a kids bowl of mac and cheese, a bite of smelly ""smoked"" fajitas, a bite of greasy old quesadilla, half a kids pizza, and apathy.  Money doesn't buy happiness, and $25 is not going to break the back, but today I would have been happier spending those $25 and more elsewhere.  Granted, it's not fine dining - and I don't expect it to - but it's so sad to see this previously nice place to eat and have family moments go down like this... specially with new awesome options in Rio Rancho like Five Guys and Ironwood Kitchen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rio-rancho?start=20,2.436,2.436,2.436,2.436,2.436

I was there for a 2 for $20 meal. Our appetizer was never delivered until our meal came. We had to tell them that they never brought it.  I ordered sautéed mushrooms with my steak.

The few times that we dined in, the experience wasn't so great...but to-go/take out always worked out much better. Barry was always on top of things - the order was always right, always on-time - all of the details were taken care of. He remembered us and made an effort to provide excellent and personalized customer service. When we were disappointed that certain items were removed or changed on the menu, this location was always helpful in letting us order our favorites (even though they weren't on the menu anymore). While the food at all Chili's really isn't anything to get excited about, it is consistent and predictable - which can be a good thing sometimes.

No matter where you go, Chili's is pretty much a safe bet - you know what you're in for! The good stuff - The new menu looks like it could be great, it has lots of stuff I want to try but I do have a few staple favorites - the chicken crispers, shrimp tacos or the create-your-own sampler (as a meal). You can never go wrong with the chips & salsa appetizer, especially when the chips are fresh! I like the computer they give you to pay your bill except when you have to split checks and the margaritas are pretty decent.  The not-so-good stuff - The service is hit and miss, sometimes I go through an entire meal without a refill. Sometimes the food is brought out cold, especially if someone in your party has a bit of a complicated meal.

Then the waitress plops a tablet with games in front of our kid not asking us nor warning us there will be a entertainment charge. Not that we can't afford .99 cents, it's just rude. We have our own tablet and cellphones she can play the same games on, why would we ever agree, it was snuck onto our bill. This isn't the first time, they snuck a entertainment fee but I barely come here that i tend to forget and every time it ruins when we go on a date here, it's not the cost that I'm bothered with, it just the feeling of being cheated.

With the onset of children and the dire need not to cook every night, yet wanting to have a drink and thin my wallet as little as possible, I find myself searching for places such as this because they're usually close, relatively quick, sufficiently affordable, and the food is amazingly passable.  I'm not saying I'd choose them over one of my local favorites but if the lines are long down the road, I know that I can eat here and not pay too dearly for it afterward.  What gets me is the service. Sorry... that is to say...the lack of service. It's not just the side of mayo with the fries or the extra cheese that was ordered and forgotten. It's not even that I can order one thing on the menu and receive something that is not that menu item I ordered. More so, the fact that it happens each. and every. time.

The plates were hotter than the food. One of us got ribs and they were janky, hardly any meat on them, I got the cajun pasta and you can tell they put warm sauce over cold pasta and the chicken reminded me of frozen pre grilled chicken.
