43,Dr. B.,"Pequannock, NJ",2,80,17.0,2.0,2013-01-25,"This was an overall disappointment.  Our first issue was that the light directly over our table flickered like crazy and was annoying during dinner.  We did bring it to the attention of the server, but he couldn't do anything and there was no effort on his part to inform the manager, which was what should have been done.  From the food we ordered, the Quesadilla Explosion was eh, nothing to write home about. The ribs and steak were good, but the mashed potatoes were dry.  The kids Mac and Cheese was not good for my kid, however, my dad liked it.  Which means it's loaded with salt.  When I tasted it, all I tasted was salt too.  Corn side for kid was really good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverdale-2?start=20,2.568,2.568,2.568,2.568,2.5680000000000005
26,Robert M.,"West Milford, NJ",43,4,,1.0,2013-03-11,"We arrived at the Riverdale location and were greeted by the hostess and informed there would be a short 15-20 minute wait for a table.  As it was Saturday evening during the prime time for dining we were expecting this.  The estimate was right to the minute as we were being seated almost exactly 20 minutes later.  Our host gave us a choice of table or booth (which was very accommodating with the kids) and we chose the booth.   The children were provided with crayons and a menu to color which was wonderful to keep them occupied as we all decided what we would like to order.  Unfortunately this would be where our problems began.  We waited at least 10 minutes before our waitress came by to take our drink order.  Our waitress introduced herself and informed us that she and a shadow would be waiting on us.  At that point we surmised that she was probably new and in training so we were understanding of the wait and expected to be patient with a new employee.  She was very pleasant and took our drink order.  Upon return we informed her that we knew what we wanted and ordered appetizers and our meals at the same time.  She did a good job of refilling our drinks but we were still waiting for our appetizers 20 minutes later.  After 25 minutes a runner came to our table and brought our children's dinner.  My wife and I both assumed our appetizers were not put in or were delivered to the wrong table.  At this point my wife and I still had no appetizers and still did not have our dinner.  I flagged her down to inform her of what was happening and she assured us our appetizers had been put in first.  She offered to take the food back and correct the order but our children were quite hungry at that point and we thought it best to let them eat.   A few minutes later our appetizers were delivered by the manager and we thought our concerns were behind us.  The manager asked us if we needed anything else and we asked for a refill of our chips and salsa (best chips we have ever had, by the way); the chip refill never appeared at our table.  My wife's southwestern spring rolls were, as usual, cooked well and quite tasty.  I ordered the trio with sliders and boneless Buffalo wings.  While both were tasty, both were cold, the burgers being undercooked as well.   Again we flagged her down to inform her of the problems.  She took my order away and said she would have the kitchen remake it.  Another 15 minutes or so went by; my wife had finished her appetizer and our children were well on their way to finishing their dinners.  We still had not gotten our dinners or my appetizer.  At this point our children had already finished their meals, I was waiting on my appetizer and both my wife's dinner and mine were still not at our table.  We decided that we would not be willing to wait any longer and we were going to cancel the appetizer and just wait for the rest of our order.  We waited an additional 15 minutes for our dinners to come out and, although she came to us at one point during that time to tell us the food would be out shortly, it still never came.  Since our children were already done eating, and we were getting frustrated with our wait, we informed her that we wanted to cancel both of our dinners and just get the check. Amazingly, this came of no shock what so ever and her reply was simply ""sure"" as she walked away.  We were somewhat surprised that, even as a new employee, this was not more of an alarm for concern.  Coincidentally, the booth directly next to ours and separated by the shared wall observed our problems and informed us that, they too, had problems with raw food.  The manager happened to be at their booth and we asked him to come to ours when he finished dealing with the problems at their table. Upon the manager's arrival he apologized and told us he would be covering our dinner order, more than half of which never came out.  He did say they were full staffed and could not account for the mistakes throughout the course of our dinner.  I mentioned that even the chips we asked him for never arrived and he did say he had asked another person to take care of that for him.  While he did offer to have our food made for us to take home we had order seafood (which does not reheat well) and, at this point, lost our appetite anyway.  He again apologized and, in an attempt at humor (I can only guess) said to us ""I guess you will be hitting the Burger King drive thru on your way home?""  That really did not set too well with any of us as our children were already upset we had not eaten with them and were concerned about us not having eaten any dinner at all. As long standing and, until last night, very satisfied customers my family felt there was little done to make sure we returned.  Actually there was no mention at all about us returning, their improvement or even retaining us as customers.  The comment about a trip to the drive thru at a fast food restaurant was in poor taste at best",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverdale-2?start=40,2.5320000000000005,2.5320000000000005,2.5320000000000005,2.5320000000000005,2.5320000000000005
48,Chelsea S.,"Lodi, NJ",74,1,,1.0,2013-05-19,"This place is a joke. We walked in at about 3PM on a Sunday and it took ten minutes for our waitress, Tracy, to come to our table after we sat down.  It took almost twenty minutes to get our appetizers and damn near 45 minutes to get our entrees. Our orders were incorrect but since our waitress never came to check on us we did not bother correcting them. Noone walking by could be bothered to take our dirty dishes. I couldn't help but notice dirty dishes on the bar that sat there my entire visit, & drinks the bartender set out that serves let sit for twenty minutes. During my meal, a large group walkedin and waited for ten minutes at the host stand before one of them had to walk to the bar to ask who he had to see to get a table. From the kitchen to the management, every single aspect of this place is a joke. They did not deserve the money we paid for our meal, and even though we are typically generous tippers, the waitress did not deserve the little tip we decided to give her.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverdale-2?start=20,2.6280000000000006,2.6280000000000006,2.6280000000000006,2.6280000000000006,2.628000000000001
21,John R.,"Franklin, NJ",7,5,,4.0,2013-09-23,"Visited the Riverdale, NJ Chili's this evening with my wife and mother. I myself have been to this Chili's 5 times in the past month and on three occasions observed one particular server going about her routine that impressed me a lot... and not just because she's easy on the eyes (very). While the rest of the staff look to be doing their jobs very well, Christina is consistently remarkable. Tonight was the first time she was with the pair/team serving my table directly, and her speed, effort, energy was as impressive as ever. An easy socializer, good humored, knowledgeable and never seems to miss the smallest detail- even on tables she ISN'T working. If something looks amiss, she's on it before anyone can notice to complain. A real pro and the type of employee I'd try to steal were I a business owner myself. My wife and I made it a point to pull her over to tell her all this to her face tonight as it's always easy to complain about bad service, and too few say anything, even when it's exemplary. Christina- you are precisely that. The food and drinks are otherwise exactly what you expect from a good kitchen in a chain restaurant. Chili's menu isn't *my* cup of tea, so my choices are few, but what I order is always done quite well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverdale-2?start=40,2.9920000000000004,2.9920000000000004,2.9920000000000004,2.9920000000000004,2.992000000000001

All this after waiting about 45 minutes.  I don't believe it was our servers fault and she was nice. The bar was on top of things too.  The problem I believe is in the kitchen.  Spoke with the manager who said it was very busy today. I don't think that is a good excuse for cold food twice. She adjusted our price to try to make up for the issues.

The only thing that probably keeps the place up is the great waitstaff. Drinks are ok as well. Not for me with the quality, price and amounts of food. Maybe for drinks and definitely not to eat",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverdale-2,3.4,3.4,3.4,,3.4000000000000004

12,Brianna W.,"Pequannock Township, NJ",15,80,22.0,5.0,2017-01-07,Good for the standard of the restaurant. Sometimes gets a little busy but what restaurant doesn't? Clean. Usually sit at bar. Never had a bad experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverdale-2,3.48,3.48,3.48,,3.4800000000000004
9,Lauren B.,"Towaco, NJ",15,108,19.0,4.0,2017-02-01,"I went to this Chili's this past weekend. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the wait time in between our food. I got the 3 courses for $10. We also had to wait a little between being seated and having our waiter and  waitress but that wasn't that bad. Between the salad and the entree portions of our meal it took a long time for the next one to come. I feel like a good 15 minutes passed after we finished the salad. The place itself was full but there wasn't that much of a wait to get in. We did call ahead seating which was perfect cause it made us go right in rather then waiting the maybe 10 minutes we would have had. other then that little fluke before it was perfect. Everyone was great, the food was delicious, etc. I would still go back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverdale-2,3.52,3.52,3.52,,3.5200000000000005
6,Kate G.,"Mahwah, NJ",16,100,27.0,4.0,2017-02-06,"Standard Chilis location. Restaurant is clean and we've had the manager visit us during several different visits. She seems to really care about guest satisfaction.  I have noticed that this location takes significantly longer to get an initial contact than other restaurants or Chili locations I've been to. I don't mind waiting, but I don't like being left to wonder if a waitress knows she has a new table or not. But once things get rolling we've always been set.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverdale-2,3.56,3.56,3.56,,3.5600000000000005
7,Mark N.,"Wayne, NJ",0,22,1.0,1.0,2017-03-07,It really doesn't get much better than this folks.  How does Chili's screw up a single-simple TO-GO order? I should have known I was trouble when I walked into Chili's and there was a guy already complaining that they screwed up his giant TO-GO order from the previous week.  Would it really have hurt to go back and make sure the order was actually correct? A main dish with no sides!!

31,Andy S.,"Mahwah, NJ",1,10,,5.0,2017-04-05,what can I say?  yes sometimes I do go to chain restaurants like chilies for example which is my favorite chain restaurant of all time!!! I love everything about chilies the way that they are very affordable they have really good food for being a chain restaurant maybe it's not the lowest calories but who cares  I love the triple dipper I love the house drinks they're amazing and I've been coming here since forever since I grew up in the area   loyal customer,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverdale-2?start=20,3.44,3.44,3.44,,3.4400000000000004
2,Paul P.,"Paramus, NJ",2,138,198.0,4.0,2017-07-28,"We decided to have lunch at chilis today. I can't even remember when was the last time I ate at a chilis. Being a typical chain restaurant, I wasn't expecting much.  We were seated within a min. The waitress was very nice and gave us enough time to go through the menu. They had a lot of options, almost too much. I decided to just go to the lunch combo page after a bit.  I chose the chicken fajitas lunch combo with Chicken tortilla soup. The soup was very tasty. I was surprised that I would enjoy it so much. The sizzling grilled chicken fajitas with peppers, onions, chipotle-garlic butter & cilantro was served nice and hot. The chicken was very moist and tasty. The side plate of pico de gallo, cheddar cheese & cumin-lime sour cream was just enough for the fajita. Overall a good meal for $8 plus tax and tips.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverdale-2,3.44,3.44,3.44,,3.4400000000000004
10,Malou C.,"Ringwood, NJ",1,36,4.0,3.0,2017-08-16,"The food is decent with a relaxing atmosphere. It's a good place for an affordable meal; however, service is very slow. Don't go here if you are pressed for time. I ordered soup and salad with the chicken enchilada soup. The soup was seasoned well and hot, but the salad was dull. However for dessert we enjoyed the skillet chocolate chip cookie which is a hot cookie topped by a scoop of vanilla ice cream with hot fudge.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverdale-2,3.36,3.36,3.36,,3.3600000000000003
1,Jay M.,"Wayne, NJ",0,22,,2.0,2017-09-13,What happened here in the past few months? Serice has been progressively worse for the past 6 months. Last time I was here it took about 10 minutes to get our drink order taken. The waiters also disappeared for long periods during the meal which seems to be the norm the past few times I was there. A few visits ago I left without taking my leftovers because it had been 10+ minutes since I asked for a box  The food is pretty good for a chain and prices are reasonable.  I used to like going here every now and then  but honestly the service issues make me not want to come back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverdale-2,3.32,3.32,3.32,,3.3200000000000003
13,Ellis F.,"Morris Plains, NJ",0,10,,2.0,2017-10-19,"Just came out of the movies and my S.O. Decided we should try Chili's which was  just across the street. Hadn't been there in some time. Ordered the DIY Fahitas, chicken wings and a salad. Wings were okay, Salad was barely passable  and the Fahitas were just awful. The Fahita pancakes were so old and dried out, They fell apart on your plate. The ingredients needed a major overhaul to be even apatizing. I remember when Chili's had the best  Fahitas in town, but forget about those days. Those days are long gone. It seems people go to Chili's because they have a bar, but if you are going there to eat, find another restaurant. Folks forget about this place. Their money is spent on advertising not on the food. I guess if you want a drink this place is okay, but if you want good food, try another place. The service was very good as was the fruity drink of the day, which was also very good. Like so many places, the food has gone downhill and the drinks were fair, though expensive. I would have given this place one star, except for my drink which was delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverdale-2,3.24,3.24,3.24,,3.2400000000000007

All in all, great service and great food.  It was about 12:30ish or so by now and the place had a waiting list... So, that's a good thing!  Thank you Chili's of Riverdale...  We'll be back!  Highly Recommended!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverdale-2,3.4,3.4,3.4,,3.4000000000000004
