27,Brian T.,"Ogden, UT",1,40,,4.0,2012-10-31,"I haven't been to a Chili's that isn't any different from another... Cookie cutter response- The food is above average-not the greatest, but certainly not bad. Nice seasoning on steaks, fajitas, ribs, sprimp, whatever. Appetizers are good, though seem to be trending smaller, which is a good thing I guess, except the price isn't reflecting the change, lol. I like that they show sports within eye-sight of most tables so you can keep up with your team(if it happpens to be on) whilst taking the fam out. Usually clean, but can get a little sketchy on busy weekends",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverdale-3,2.384,2.384,2.384,2.384,2.384
19,Alden C.,"Tacoma, WA",4063,3498,745.0,3.0,2013-05-22,"For some reason I don't like driving in Ogden at all. I would have thought the streets would have been more grid like but they are not. So I took a seemingly convenient exit off of the Interstate to get a bite to eat. I was not too hungry but wanted a little something for the long drive home back to Tacoma. I came across Chili's and decided that is the place I want to go. Instantly the Southwest Eggrolls came to mind. And that is what I got alongside a small dinner salad and it all hit the spot! Service was always friendly, no doubt about it but at times it did get slow. The guy that was taking my order was new so maybe that was where the kinks in speed came from. I was not in any hurry though so there was no need to get worked up about it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverdale-3,,,,,
5,Terry W.,"Dublin, CA",1,6,,2.0,2013-10-24,"We went there to support a promotion of a percentage of the bill for a fallen police officer. Food as good but our server,  Johnnie, was terrible. He took a long time to get our drink order but said he had a large party to cover. We couldn't see the large party though. He hardly checked in on us. Served our food without saying much and gave us a check without asking if we wanted anything more. He provided bare minimum to do his job. The shift leader asked how everything was and we told her. Nothing more was done. Left with a bad feeling over our meal. On a positive note, the hostess was very nice and engaging.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverdale-3?start=20,,,,,
18,Brooke S.,"Fruit Heights, UT",359,251,66.0,4.0,2013-12-10,"I dint know what's different about this particular Chili's location? But I never groan in disappointment, when my daughter suggests eating here. Seriously, it's surprisingly good for a chain restaurant. It's updated. The service is fast. The prices aren't bad. The entire menu has been re-vamped. The past two times that we've visited; I've ordered one of the new items: mango chile chicken. The first time I had it, I wondered if it was so good, just because I was starving?!  But I tried it again, another day, and it was still delicious. There are so many restaurant choices on Riverdale Road. No one is more surprised than I am, that Chili's is a top contender! But it is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverdale-3,,,,,
1,Montain B.,"Ogden, UT",3,35,18.0,3.0,2014-01-01,"Food quality has gotten better. Heather, the general manager, is clearly working hard to improve the Riverdale reputation. The staff works hard to communicate progress and are eager to help. I still can't stand the table side tables.  I'm glad that we gave our neighborhood Chili's another chance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverdale-3?start=20,,,,,
25,Alan G.,"Ogden, UT",1,10,3.0,2.0,2014-02-13,"Amy the bartender and Erin, one of the servers are pretty much the only ones here worth having take your order. Management is horrible especially the restaurant manager.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverdale-3,,,,,
26,Derek D.,"Salt Lake City, UT",124,7,1.0,1.0,2014-06-01,"Chili's is normally a restaurant I fall back on when it's Sunday night in Utah and nothing else is open except for the McDonald's across the street and the Denny's down the road. Not anymore. This most recent visit was brutal. I mean, I never considered it to be top notch Tex Mex but I never thought it was bad by any means until recently. I ordered the Fajita Trio and a margarita, and that's where I went wrong. I didn't keep track of time, so I can't complain about the wait, but when my food came out, the guacamole (I asked specifically for ""no guacamole"" since I am allergic) was crusted brown and the sour cream (I also asked for no sour cream) was separated and warm. All of the vegetables were warm and limp, as if they had been sitting out under a heat lamp with the rest of the food. The cheese, waxy and starting to sweat. ""Whatever, it's all good"", I thought, ""I came here for the meats and I wasn't planning on eating half of that stuff anyway."" Then I started to chow. The meat was hot, the chicken was juicy and tender. The shrimp was the weakest link in the trio. I wouldn't call it shrimp. It was like biting into a gummy worm that tasted like shrimp. Kid you not. Spongy and soft. I could chew it with my tongue. It was like they put it in a bowl of water and microwaved it for 1 min to cook it.  The other thing is the lack of customer service that has been replaced by tablets at each table with a full menu and the option to pay your tab. Why are there still paper menus? Why is there a wait staff? The table is so cluttered, that when you have a 4-top table with everyone's food, drinks, condiments, corny tablet, accompanied by chips and salsa, there is no room to eat. People's elbows fly around grabbing silverware, drinks, finger foods, and napkins. No fun. No fun at all.  I don't have much else to say. My margarita that was blended was separated with all of the tequila at the bottom and a lime snow cone on top, and I only got one glass of water to last me the whole night. Swing and a miss, Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverdale-3,,,,,
2,Raymond N.,"Ogden, UT",0,4,,3.0,2014-07-16,chiles in riverdale......quesadilla explosion salad was wonderful. Server had good attitude she was polite but spent too much time chatting with other customers constantly. Sometimes it was difficult to get her attention. Smokehouse burger wasn't too bad but could be better. Craft burger down the road is a better burger by far.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverdale-3?start=20,,,,,
3,Brandon W.,"Clearfield, UT",0,1,,2.0,2014-11-01,"Did a call ahead seating for 45 minutes away. As soon as I got there (45 minutes later) they told me due to the number of people doing call ahead I had to wait an hour and a half like everybody else. Please tell me, why do you do call ahead if you stop the service when people use it? Kind of ridiculous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverdale-3?start=20,,,,,
23,Leland L.,"Honolulu, HI",0,6,,2.0,2015-03-06,"The service was great, but the food was not. I ordered the Bacon Ranch Quesadillas with steak. It was way too salty and the steak was gross. My wife ordered the Monterey Chicken and that was also too salty. My kids ordered pizzas and there was more sauce than cheese. Overall, the food was pretty crappy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverdale-3,,,,,
0,Barbara H.,"Ogden, UT",5,31,,5.0,2015-04-27,"My recent visit to Chilis was a good experience. The server kept our drinks, chips and salsa full. My monterey chicken was perfect for the eating plan I am on. Chilis is always a favorite!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverdale-3?start=20,,,,,
24,Alton M.,"Ogden, UT",0,4,,1.0,2015-05-13,"I don't like greens or vegetables so I order lunch with a salad of just tomatoes, croutons and thousand island if they have it.  Trainee takes order with trainer present.  Five minutes later trainee comes back that she didn't understand.  Repeated salad order.  Five minutes later the trainer comes back saying the trainee didn't understand the order.  Repeated the salad order.  Five minutes later the manager comes saying they had a problem understanding the order.  Even my friend had to say, ""What is hard to understand?"".  I just told her cancel the salad order as we have explained it four or five times.  Manager comes back five minutes later saying she removed the salad from my lunch menu order.  Lunch is only about seven dollars.  I pray she loses her job before someone is less nice than I am encounters her management style.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverdale-3,,,,,
21,Jason T.,"Hooper, UT",132,15,,2.0,2015-07-03,Food is good but this is two times in a row the service is incredibly slow.

22,Kat N.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,15,5.0,1.0,2015-08-24,"Worst,  chili's managers suck, food was under cooked and on top of that they never even asked if there was anything we needed after food was sent out! !!

20,Regina F.,"Ogden, UT",0,64,1.0,1.0,2015-12-06,"This place used to be awesome and then it all of a sudden started sucking. Poor service, long waits without explanations; overcharged. I can't handle this place anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverdale-3,,,,,
10,Travis C.,"Lihue, HI",166,115,69.0,3.0,2016-02-09,"Ive always been a fan of Chilis. I will choose it over Applebees any day. I have been to this Chilis multiple times before and I like it every single time.  The food is always great. I always try to get the chips and salsa because in my personal opinion, Chilis has the best chips and salsa out of any fast food restaurant I have had. The Chicken Crispers are a favorite of mine but This time around I went with a burger, which is also a great choice at Chilis. I feel that the food has gotten a little more pricey over the several years which is kind of a bummer. I think its a little overpriced but the business is clearly doing well.  The service here is good about 90% of the time. This time around it was one of the 10% when its not so great. Our waiter was a bit weird with us and acted like he was annoyed with me and my friends from the moment he walked up to us. I don't think I saw him smile once. I also caught a negative remark about another customer as he walked by us. Just kind of a crappy attitude for an employee to have.  All that said I will be back... I always come back to Chilis, I just wish this one wasn't the closest to my house.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverdale-3,,,,,
16,Racheal S.,"Homestead, FL",0,6,,5.0,2016-08-12,"Love love LOVE this place! The only issue I've ever had in this Chilis was with other guests.  Food is great, fast and hot. Most servers are pretty friendly and respectful. But the absolute best service you'll get is with Martin the bartender. He's the friendliest, the funniest and the best at pegging what drink is best for you. Not to mention he can keep a full bar happy and laughing! Love that guy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverdale-3,,,,,
17,Megan C.,"Roy, UT",7,4,2.0,1.0,2016-12-26,"Disgusting food. My husband and I Ordered the 2 meat platter and picked the half rack ribs and chicken CRISPERS, which also came with a side of corn on the cob and fries. The chicken CRISPERS were spongelike fish battered crap that was barely a light tan in color which seemed still undercooked and doughy. We called the waiter over to ask if we got the right chicken cuz it looked nothing like what was on the menu and it sure wasn't CRISPY. The waiter's reply was that that was their regular ""breaded"" chicken. The pictures on their menu was of a honey mesquite BBQ glazed crispy chicken. Nowhere on the menu was there any honey mesquite labeled for order. The corn was mushy and tough cuz it most likely sat in water for a whole day or two. The ribs had hardly any meat on them. Not going to eat here EVER again. Our meal came to 50 bucks!!!! And we could only stomach the half rack of ribs which was mediocre at best. This restaurant can go to hell.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverdale-3,,,,,

I forgot my 2 whole bite of leftover food on the table, I'm pregnant and those 2 bites meant something(lol) and she ran it out to my car for me! She did such an amazing job :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverdale-3,,,,,
15,JC P.,"Miami Beach, FL",18,120,196.0,1.0,2017-05-17,"The dirtiest Chili's anywhere. I left my phone in the truck charging so they truly lucked out tonight. I sat at the bar in a 4 stool section to the left covered with dirty plates, not kidding, and remained untouched for at least another 10 minutes. There were two couples eating to my right in the main section and there were dirty plates in between them too. I was noticed by the bartender who immediately offered service. I pointed out to the obvious in front of me politely. I'm sure my face expression was also telling. He served me a few minutes later. Yes, it took a few minutes longer than usual, but the entire bar remained dirty even longer. He was clearly alone with no barback. Plates on my side were later removed, but the counter was never wiped from food remains until I insisted. This place was classic management neglect or just non existent. I can't imagine local people come here daily and accept this. I wonder how that kitchen looks like. Chips all over the floor, even napkins, visibly walked on by guess and employess ilike. This got to be a poor neighborhood. The bartender also serviced the tables around the bar area which he chose to clean before the bar. I even talked to him about it and let him know how disappointed I was about the dirty food plates everywhere. He was a seemely hardworking, clean-cut, well groomed and good looing guy, but this was the dirties bar I've ever been to. Who owns this place, I wondered. Dirty plates and glasses on top of refrigerators. The sink area below was packed too. My salad was drowned in dressing too. FYI, I stayed to eat here ONLY because I am nursing a badly injured ankle and was hurting pretty good. My truck was at Home Depot and the walk was painful. I would NEVER even sit at a place like this and will let them know as well.  I had no choice last night and hated it. However, contrary to what others would suggest, I tipped him well. No one should be treated like this. SHAMEFUL!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverdale-3,,,,,
13,Tim L.,"Ogden, UT",8,3,,2.0,2017-08-11,They way over cooked my first steak and the broccoli was cold and then slightly under cooked my second steak. My wife's ribs had very little meat on them. The server was very nice and tried hard to work out the issues. He gave us a free bowl of baked potato soup that was very good!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverdale-3,,,,,

11,Christina B.,"Ogden, UT",0,4,,2.0,2017-10-27,"My wife and I don't go out often so to go out Friday night was a big deal. We picked Chili's on Riverdale for a quick meal enroute to another destination.  Once seated, our waitress was prompt and very sweet, but the food was very disappointing.  I ordered half a rack of dry rubbed baby back ribs with an order of onion rings.  My wife ordered the Caribbean salad with shrimp.  When my ribs arrived I was disappointed to see just four ribs, and no onion rings because they weren't  ready.  The ribs were prepared well but only four short ribs looked very lonely on the elongated platter they were served on.  I was going to share my ribs with my wife but when she saw how few ribs were provided she felt bad for me so she refused to have one.  My wife's salad was no better.  A sad affair that was institutional at best.  Finely chopped iceberg lettuce sprinkled with an overabundance of raisins, big chunks of pineapple and the tiniest shrimp you can buy in a frozen food section at your local supermarket.  We won't be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverdale-3,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
12,Melissa C.,"Roy, UT",0,8,10.0,1.0,2017-12-09,"We got a server named Maria....what a witch. She was so rude. From the moment we sat down. My husband and I went with our 3 kids that are 15 and under. She asked, ""will this be on a separate check?"" Uhhhhhhhh, nope! Our glasses were constantly empty. She NEVER asked if we wanted more chips. Even when we told her we wanted more, she took FOREVER! I ordered the ribeye steak, medium. She took ten minutes to come back to ask if everything was okay. (Which it wasn't). My steak was well done! My steak finally came back done the right way. I could only take 4-5 bites of it because I was full from eating all my sides. I couldn't eat my steak with the sides it was meant to be with. I couldn't eat my dinner with the rest of my family. So when it came time to pay the bill, she asked ""is there something wrong? You've been mean to me the whole time."" Are ya kidding me?!? Yeah, you're a shitty server! I wasn't mean to her, I was annoyed with her. She was the raunchy one. Then.....my steak was still on the ticket! I asked her to take it off and she replied, ""well is it our fault you got full?!"" Ummmmmmmm, yeah, it is! You took forever to come back and check! Idiot! Then she said, ""well you have the steak packed to take home. I'm not taking it off the ticket."" I told her, ""fine, I'll leave it here."" I took my box and put it on the table. She left in a huff to get the manager. The manger came over and fixed it for us. Super nice guy. You know Yzma on the movie, Emperor's New Groove? When Kuzco said ""scary beyond all reason?"" and they answered ""yep"" and the Kuzco said ""that's her."" EXACTLY!!! She's just mean and nasty. So if you ever get a server named Maria, run! Or ask to be moved to a different section.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverdale-3,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
9,Aiyana P.,"Clinton, UT",12,84,28.0,1.0,2017-12-24,"I don't have a lot of high hopes for Chili's anymore. Every location I've visited has been horrendous. The food is always cold and it doesn't matter if there is one person or 40 in the establishment, it ALWAYS takes an hour + to get your food which I think is beyond ridiculous. My food was gross and bland tasting, and they even got the orders all mixed up. The waiter we had never once came back to refill our waters. The only time he offered was when we were literally standing up to leave. My dad was nice enough to leave a tip but the only tip I think that should have been left was to have better customer service. Not a place I will return to again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-riverdale-3,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
