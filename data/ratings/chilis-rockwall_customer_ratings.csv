36,Donovan B.,"Lavon, TX",5,3,,4.0,2012-02-19,"My wife and I ate here yesterday.  It was busy but we were seated quickly and did not have to wait.  Our waitress was very friendly.  Currently they have a two for 20 meal, and we got that and both chose 6oz. Steak, mashed potatoes, and steamed broccoli.  The appetitizer we chose was the guacamole.  The time between ordering and being served was perfect, and we were munching on our appetizer during this time, which was good.  The steaks came out and honestly were really cooked nicely.  I just cut in and ate, no steak sauce needed.  The mashed potatoes had Bacon, cheese, chives, and were also great.  The broccoli had just a touch of seasoning and tasted good.  All in all, very good meal at a very reasonable $30 including tip.  We will definitely return to this Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockwall?start=20,2.064,2.064,2.064,2.064,2.064
25,Nichole D.,"Royse City, TX",3,30,4.0,1.0,2012-07-19,What happened to this place? It use to be so wonderful! Last few times I've gone to this Chili's it was dirty. Tables everywhere were just left messy and the floor covered in food and trash. Even the tables I have been sat at lately were covered in crumbs.  The waitresses I've had lately have been extremely slow and not very attentive or nice. What is up with their water? Do they not use filtered water? I know water in Rockwall isn't the greatest but everywhere else I've gone in town has great water. The water here has always tasted like cleaner. So much so that I've been afraid of drinking it. I have also experienced dirty cups and utensils several times. The burger that I always get has been good and the fries sometimes way over seasoned but that's just a minor gripe. After our last experience here I won't be going back. It just wasn't pleasant. I felt like I was at some grimy cafeteria.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockwall?start=20,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000002,1.7000000000000004
32,Mark R.,"Royse City, TX",30,29,18.0,2.0,2013-03-18,"The service was horrible... waited 35 minutes for three entrees. The restaurant was only about 1/4 full, our waiter had 2 tables to manage and I still found myself filling our water glasses on my own. Pre-bussed our own table and had to wait for the check for nearly 10 minute. On top of all that, the food was lame...

28,Jeff P.,"Rockwall, TX",15,23,8.0,2.0,2014-01-24,"Rockwall Chili's has been consistently good for years. Unfortunately, the quality of the good has been steadily going downhill.

When my daughter and I walked in, they looked at us like we were lost and asked us ""how can we help you?"" Well, yeah. ..we wanna EAT! So they sat us down at a dirty table...then when I got my boneless buffalo wings, they were dry! I asked for a manager and he brought out some more. ..but he only brought out 1 order, when I clearly ordered 2! I'm pissed. So the waiter asks if I want him to bring me a side of sauce for the cold wings...by this point, I want him out of my face.

33,KP P.,"Plano, TX",0,2,,2.0,2014-06-04,"Had the Country Fried Steak at this Chili's a couple of weeks ago.  Unfortunately, the steak was undercooked and too chewy for me.  Hoping their meat purveyor will take this as good feedback to upgrade their quality of this steak.  If you happen to be in Arlington and want a really good country fried steak - check out the Division Street Diner - theirs is awesome!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockwall?start=20,2.024,2.024,2.024,2.024,2.024

16,Julie L.,"Rockwall, TX",4,38,10.0,1.0,2014-08-10,"Why do I keep doing this to myself? Went last night with 2 adults and 3 children. My guest is a vegetarian and wanted cheese instead of chicken enchiladas.  They couldn't do that, which tells me that they come pre-packaged. We all ordered at the same time. The youngest wanted plain cheese nachos with sour cream. That's not what he was served. Of course, we sent it back. Luckily the manager was walking by and retrieved the nachos from the kitchen, no sour cream. It finally came and we practically had to wake the kid up.......poor service, took too long.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockwall,2.02,2.02,2.02,2.02,2.02
29,April A.,"Cypress, TX",0,3,,1.0,2014-09-01,Manager kristina/Kristin is rude and unprofessional. My order was undercooked and super small and the manager justified it.

24,Cyrus A.,"Rockwall, TX",2,8,,2.0,2014-10-01,"I certainly agree with the other recent reviews in that Chili's was formerly good but is now below-average on a good day.  I have identified two culprits: (a) they are apparently using much lower quality ingredients, and (b) they have butchered the menu, including removing or materially altering many of my favorite dishes.  Chili's needs to turn back the clock to about 5 or 10 years ago to win me back as a consistent customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockwall?start=20,2.216,2.216,2.216,2.216,2.216

23,Erica Dreadedup C.,"Irving, TX",35,18,6.0,3.0,2014-12-21,"We went here today for my little nephews birthday. It was ok. Service was fast the food was hot, and the server was nice. We had a pretty big party so he tried his best, but he was on top of the drinks. The bathroom wasn't that clean and my nephew wanted a cookie monster for bis bday and they didn't have one! Really disappointing. They had a good happy hour and the cowboys game was on so that made up for the missing cookie Monster. It wasn't worth the drive from Irving tho so next time I will stick to the chili's near my house.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockwall?start=20,,,,,

19,Laurey W.,"Rockwall, TX",117,19,,1.0,2015-05-12,"It was awful.  A couple of years ago I got a horrible case of food poisoning from chicken enchiladas.  Only went back (against my better judgement) because of a work luncheon.  Service was awful, restaurant was dirty and no lie...it took an hour to get our food.  Will NEVER go back no matter what.  You need new management!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockwall,,,,,
22,Nathan B.,"Dallas, TX",0,1,,1.0,2015-06-06,It was awful. Took an hour to get the food out to us. Half of the food was cold.

18,Laurie B.,"Heath, TX",2,30,11.0,3.0,2015-07-07,Would have been four stars but service was just ok and definitely could have been better. Forgot our chips and salsa. Had to reorder. Our drinks were warm with hardly any ice. Lunch specials were yummy!  Had dirty silverware and no salt on the tables when we arrived. Had to bring it out later.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rockwall,,,,,
21,Hannah N.,"Rockwall, TX",0,4,,2.0,2015-08-07,Service is alright. I think the service at the later hours are more enjoyable. Honestly the only reason why I keep coming back here is because the molten chocolate lava cake is amazing. My friends and I are fanatics about it.

There was nobody at the front. Eventually someone came over from a table and seated us. We waited about 5 minutes and not one person came over to even get our drink order. I finally just got up and walked next door. I would have had a suggestion should anyone have been at the front to ask me why i was leaving or how things were. But still not an employee in sight.

This place is always disgusting, & never crowded enough to be that way. I would rather drive to the Chilis in Rowlett than come here. Most recently, the table I was sat at was covered in grease, as well as the booth seats, & the floor was covered in chips, trash, bread, & crayons...the hostess just repeatedly cleaned off tables & dumped everything into the floor & then NEVER swept it up. Thus, the whole place was trashed. The restaurant had MAYBE ten tables being served, & there was trash on 50% of the empty tables.

Although I'm deducting two start simply because the last couple of times I got shoved in a back side corner area that was filthy. The service wasn't as good as usual. Now I know I need to request a certain area to get better service I suppose. The left side as you walk in I believe is where all of the rookies serve.

The menu was back to classic with a little flare for everyone. My bacon cheeseburger was right on the money at 9.99 and the flavor was so amazing thee wasn't anything left on the plate. Children's menu has a great variety for all the picky eaters and my daughter actually finished half her meal! Which is a lot considering the potions. She enjoyed her cheese sandwich so much she wanted to take it and fries to lunch tomorrow! Lol! food prep time to table was excellent and the right temperature.
