26,Lexi K.,"Rogers, AR",22,11,1.0,2.0,2012-01-13,"Not really sure why there was a 25-45 minute wait at this place.. Maybe so the soccer moms can drink and take their kids at the same time? The host, early to mid 20's male was an epic twat. He did the 'COME ON already wave' to us to signal we needed to follow him to our seats. The menus: Filthy, sticky, moldy?.. The waiter we had was a VERY cool guy.. although he ASKED us if we wanted waters to drink. Waters are NOT optional people. You want us to buy more drinks, you keep us hydrated. Simple as that. The drinks: I had a margarita. Decent. BF ordered something they didn't have..The food: Each of us had to order something completely different than what we picked in the first place because they were out of something. So we left fairly dissatisfied. The best part was our waiter. He was cool.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rogers?start=20,2.472,2.472,2.472,2.472,2.472
23,Bathanis Y.,"Rogers, AR",1,8,2.0,4.0,2012-03-13,"My husband loves Chili's Restaurant! We have been there multiple times for the past couple of months. Review from 3/11/2012 Service: Food took awhile to be served but that could be because we had a party of 11 people. Waitress was good at keeping her eyes out for when we needed refills on our drinks. She was definitely unorganized when she took our orders because paying for the food took longer than eating it.  Food: I had the Custom Combo for $16.99, my order was two 6 oz steaks, one cooked at medium and one at medium rare. Cooked perfectly to my liking. This was the first time I asked for a MEDIUM steak and got medium instead of medium well, the medium rare was a medium rare. My sides were unseasoned broccoli and corn on the cob (it was a full corn, not half), both were delicious. Environment: Our space was kind of tight since we pushed two tables together to eat instead of sitting at the long big booth, which could have been worst. Great place to good talks and dining!  Overall: Love Chili's food and will go back in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rogers?start=20,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.736
29,Betty F.,"Rogers, AR",35,29,,2.0,2013-02-19,"Try to avoid the Rogers location... ALWAYS rude staff, especially when ordering take out. It's the whole 'what do you want, hurry up, I don't have time to be taking your order'... They are so stingy with their dipping sauces, I always know that I won't have enough for my whole meal. The Rogers location is proverbially filthy, sticky menus, crammed, and SO LOUD!  I particularly hate how the wait staff constantly SCREMS out ""CORNER"" every time they return to the podium or kitchen... Buy some mirrors if its that big of an issue; other restaurants seem to manage without screaming annoying caution alerts every time they walk 2 steps. This might be trivial to some, but I really take issue with watching my food being prepared from a shipping box when you stand by the kitchen waiting for take out - I know that all these places receive their food in mass quantity, but I don't want to see it... They do expect you to tip when ordering take out, but I'm a believer that unless your bringing my food curbside, there will be no tip for standing there and being a pretty 19 year old!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rogers?start=20,2.568,2.568,2.568,2.568,2.5680000000000005
28,Fairey F.,"Rogers, AR",0,24,,2.0,2013-04-12,"Haven't been to Chili's in many, many months and previously only at the insistence of others.  The food quality is terrible.  I've experienced this at their other locations around the state, too.  It seems their quality control is lacking all the while their prices keep going up.  My biggest complaint, as with most chain restaurants:  Why on earth would you put the core of a head of lettuce in a salad?  Every - single - time?!?!?!  It goes in the waste bin with the other trash!!!  And I know the cooks know better because every single time they cover it up with the rest of the salad.  Every time?!?!?!?  Not coincidence.  And for the love of all that is holy, please DO NOT keep serving corn on the cob.  No one wants to watch grown people gnawing food with corn and butter running all over their faces.  It's repulsive.  It is amazing how many people do this even when they appear to be on dates or a business lunch.  The same goes for gnawing on ribs and then putting your disgusting chewed up bones on the table?!?!?!  Really?!?!  Brrrt - makes me sick just thinking about it. I would only go back for drinks but not to eat.  Even that's dubious since there is no outdoor seating and the atmosphere hasn't been updated since the '80's when I was a kid an thought going to Chili's was the business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rogers?start=20,,,,,
17,Mary X.,"Centerton, AR",139,104,90.0,2.0,2013-06-16,"Been here a few times and I'm just constantly finding so many things wrong that are easily fixable! Table for eight people. ATMOSPHERE: Ambiance is the usual...dim lights, a hum of conversations and such. It was fine until we sat down. The seat AND back cushion at one of the benches was broken - completely detached and sliding off from the base of the booth. We asked for another table and our waitress said ""They're all pretty much doing the same thing."" So, she just slid them back to place and said ""I hope that works for you."" I guess she didn't here me muttering ""You better hope it works for us too."" SERVICE: Friendly and willing to do what it took to make us happy. Drinks were refilled quickly. One down side to service were the filthy sticky menus that were handed to us - they were new too! Towards the end of our dinner, we were reluctantly asked if anyone wanted dessert ""Did anyone want desert? We can probably get something out if you want but we've closed already."" So that tells me, you just asked to be polite but really didn't want to go through the trouble of making any desert. So, really, you shouldn't have asked if you weren't serious about it! SMH. FOOD: Food was hot and tasty. Drinks were good. Steaks were cooked right, Everything was fine...UNTIL, one of the guys with us found paper from the cheese slice...still with the cheese. He pulled a pretty big chunk of butcher paper out from the sandwich - about the size of a credit card, and then another piece from his mouth. The servers quickly brought out a new plate and did not charge for it. OVERALL: Very disappointed in how things happened throughout our dinner. RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE GUESTS: Only go with low standards. RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE OWNERS: RENOVATION NOW!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rogers,,,,,
27,Fan D.,"Springdale, AR",0,6,,1.0,2013-11-02,I recently stopped at Chili's to order a long time favorite meal.  The Margarita Chicken.  On my first bite of the chicken I instantly spit it back out.  The chicken tasted as if it was microwaved and definitely not grilled.  I asked the server if they changed the way they cooked the food and she said they removed the grills and have conveyor belts to cook everything.  I do not think I will order anything again that will require grilling.  I recommend asking your local chili's if they have grills or conveyor belts to cook food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rogers?start=20,,,,,
16,Ian C.,"Berkeley, CA",24,55,59.0,1.0,2015-01-19,"I had lunch there today with my friend so thought I should review this place. My friend was already waiting for me at a booth so I can't comment on wait to get seating, but we went before the lunch rush. The waiter had a good start - he had water already set for me, but it seemed to go all downhill after that. It took us forever to get our order to the point that I was making it obvious that we were ready and still took forever to get our order. The food was okay. Nothing special, but it was decent flatbread. Slightly overpriced for the quality, but what can you do. Water was never refilled so basically it was as if I didnt have a waiter. The little device that you can pay on at the table was cool though. In all I probably wont suggest this place to friends and will only go if its the only option. There are so many other better options near there that are tex mex themed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rogers,,,,,

14,Steve B.,"Rogers, AR",10,82,42.0,4.0,2015-03-08,"Typical Chilis however when I lived in TN when setting in the bar you got free chips and salsa. They also had bar drinks 2 for 1. They do not do that here that must be the reason why they do not have much business here when where I lived in TN town of 12,000 it was packed split when open. I miss TN. We come 2 or 3 times a year where when in TN we went closer to 8 to 10 times a year. Drinks and food are good here however I pay a lot more here and the service is mediocre.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rogers,,,,,
5,Summer C.,"Bentonville, AR",995,1008,3062.0,3.0,2015-04-11,"I've been to this location a couple times. One time with friends and another time with my husband and child. PARKING/WAIT/AMBIANCE: They have a large sized parking lot surround in the restaurant. They have a front entrance and a side entrance (for pick up orders). Neither time I had a wait. With my group of friends we called a head, but we came during a weeknight and it was not too crowded. The time with my family we came on a weekend night, but it was during a icey storm, so it was not too crowded. Chili's has a casual, sports bar, family type of a vibe. You can come here with your friends, family, or buddies to watch a sports game. CUSTOMER SERVICE: I have always had great customer service here. Very friendly and helpful waiters. FOOD: The food is pretty good and just normal. Nothing amazing. They have a good selection of items on the menu for everyone to choose from. Last time I was there (with my family) we ordered: Tableside Guacamole - yummy Two Beef Soft Tacos Kids Chicken Bites BBQ Bacon Burger Overall, I would come here again, but not super high on my list of repeat restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rogers,,,,,

11,Karla H.,"Fayetteville, AR",0,3,,1.0,2015-07-26,"Went there with my husband, brother in law and his wife.  The waitress we got was okay at first but after we ordered our food her attitude changed and it was the worst experience we have ever had at a restaurant.  The floor was filthy, very disgusting.  We didnt get our appetizers of chips and salsa until after our food was already on the table and I had to remind her that we still wanted the chips and salsa that we ordered.  My husband ordered his food with no tomatoes and she brought out his pasta full of tomatoes, so we had to send that back. My brother in law ordered his steak medium well and it was cooked well done. The Crispy chicken tenders were horrible, way too over cooked and that was very disappointing because that is my favorite item from other Chili's we have been to.  It took a while for us to get silverware and when we did get it she wrapped all our silverware together in one napkin and slammed it on the table and said ""here you go,"" like we were inconveniencing her.  Took forever to get refills.  Just all around very bad experience we will not be back ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rogers,,,,,

6,Stewart O.,"Bentonville, AR",14,233,475.0,2.0,2016-01-23,Came back to chilis for good food. Disappointed today since we wanted hot water with lemon to drink first before deciding what to order. Server came back after 8 minutes with not hot but warm water. She gave us tea with it saying in case we wanted it. Told her we dont need it and she turn around and told us that the hot water would cost us $2.00 each! Ridiculous. Told her this was sneaky and unacceptable.

3,David F.,"Rogers, AR",0,6,3.0,3.0,2016-07-11,"The first impression was hurt by the number of uncleared tables and food scattered about the floor. We were greet in a friendly manner, seated quickly, and the serving staff was very patient and helpful. The food was a mixed bag. The combination appetizer plate was pretty good especially the Southwestern eggrolls. The Caribean salad was also good but the 3 pieces of pineapple included were still so green, hard and sour that we couldn't eat them.  The Cajun Shrimp Pasta was pretty bland and lacked depth. We also found the stem of one of the tomatoes in it.  The Rib steak was closer to medium than medium rare. I like salt more than anyone I know, and the steak was too salty for me. And, the oil the ""Home Fries"" were cooked in was either very old, or simply nasty tasting. Not planning to go back as I believe there are better places to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rogers,,,,,

They also don't seem to have WiFi paid or free. It's also best to come for lunch, but if you come here for dinner be prepared to wait at least 20-30 minutes.
