76,Lou H.,"San Diego, CA",5,186,52.0,4.0,2012-01-24,"Alright Chili's are pretty much all the same. They are everywhere. That turned out to be a good thing on my latest trip to Chicago. My friend who was traveling with me is a huge 49ers fan and their playoff game against the Saints was starting just as we arrived at O'Hare.  Because we wanted to see the Chicago Wolves game at 7pm we were going to be in Rosemont anyway and there was a Chili's right across the parking lot from the Allstate Arena.  When the football game started we were seated in a booth in the bar and we ordered lunch, usual Chili's stuff. The food was fine but the service was excellent.  They didn't care that 1, we came in with bags straight from the airport and 2, we sat in there the entire game for 3.5 hours. Meanwhile the Wolves game was starting to attract a lot of pre-gamers and the place was packed. The staff never gave us the evil eye or anything. I really thought that at some point they'd ask us to leave because we hadn't ordered anything in over an hour and they totally could've used our booth for another party. I'm super glad they let us stay in there and continued to bring us free refill after free refill of soda because we got to see one of the most exciting NFL playoff endings in recent history.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosemont?start=60,3.024,3.024,3.024,3.024,3.024
54,Claire M.,"Forest Park, IL",145,353,392.0,2.0,2012-02-05,"So this night had been a plan in the making for over a month.  I was all excited about it and naturally because of that, was greatly disappointed.  Here's why.   We were going to a wolves game with a group of people and a few of us decided to meet at Chili's to grab something to eat before the game which started at 7.  Last year, we came and ate after the game and had such a good time we decided to repeat history.   I'd never really been much into Chili's but I got a gift card from a coworker for Christmas and was pleasantly surprised by the one in North Riverside (see that review for the GOODness) and was thrilled to go back so I could enjoy 1) Diet Dr Pepper from the fountain (we don't keep soda at home anymore and any time I can enjoy it is a huge deal) and 2) savor their delicious grilled veggie tacos.   Now I don't know if Chili's has changed that much in a short time since I was there with my holiday gift card (and once since then) or if the one in Rosemont just sucks way more BUT... This one did NOT have the extensive fountain drink selection that the one in North Riverside has/had.  You could get any combination of beverage imaginable.  Peach flavored Sprite among many other choices!  So right off the bat, I was saddened that I was not going to get my Diet Dr. Pepper.  The grilled veggie tacos had also been removed from the menu.  Shit.  I'm a vegetarian so I ended up having to eat a house salad.  No French dressing.  No Italian dressing.  They did have a citrus vinaigrette (sp?) which was good.  It just really stink to go out to eat and have like ONE option.  I love salad, but it'd be nice if that wasn't my ONLY choice.  And I had been craving those damn tacos for weeks!   Now, for the other less than stellar aspect which in part, was not the fault of Chili's.  Our party of 6 arrived at 5:15pm and the Wolves game started at 7.  I figured we'd be cutting it close and expected it to be quite crowded.  So we get our pager at 5:15 and were told it would be a 30 to 45 minute wait.  Cool.  Right at 6:00 (45 minutes later) our pager still had not gone off.  My affable Italian coworker (god bless him) approached the host stand in his usually charming way to ask if our table would be ready soon.  Mind you, they knew we were a party of 6 and had waited the maximum wait time they had given us.  They offered to spit us up between 2 booths, 3 at each and the booths weren't even close to each other!  Initially we said fine, since we were hungry and had to get to the game.   As we walked back to the booths, we noticed a HUUUUUUUGE group of people who were seated at tables pushed together that ran almost the entire length of one side of the place!  They had begun standing up and had their coats on so we asked if we could wait and sit at one of the longer tables they'd been occupying so all 6 of us could socialize, as was our plan the entire time.   Apparently these people had been there since 4:30 and it was now 6:15.  This was actually pretty funny because we were standing there awkwardly, staring at them (as if that was going to make them move faster) watching these old women look through a photo album and take forever to say goodbye to each other.   FINALLY enough of them moved so that one longer table could be turned back around and we sat elbow to elbow.    The dear manager brought us out complimentary chips with queso and salsa which was very nice.  I'm a very easy going person and wasn't much bothered by the waiting/seating situation.  A couple of the people I was with, however, were quite annoyed.  I'm a very go with the flow person and felt kinda bad about their obvious displeasure.   My only disappointments (and I guess personally, they were pretty major because I was specifically looking forward to the things they did not have) were with not having the food and drink I had planned to order and then lack of another option besides the house salad.   I will stick with North Riverside from now on and hope that they NEVER take away the endless drink options and grilled veggie tacos.  =(   As for the food of my dining companions, they enjoyed theirs very much.  And we made it to the game right on time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosemont?start=40,3.4,3.4,3.4,2.8560000000000003,3.4000000000000004

73,Nina I.,"Chicago, IL",668,491,62.0,4.0,2012-03-22,I like Chilli's food and drinks since I used to pretty much be a regular here I've tried almost everything.

Sat at bar with coworkers the last night in town.  Server was relatively stressed and seemed to need a break.  My service was slow but had it not been for my coworkers to keep me distracted, I would have walked out.  I ordered a 6 oz steak and 1/2 rack rib dinner.  It was tasty so I'll give them the 3 stars for the freshness of the food. Even the broccoli was cooked properly.   You know what you get when you eat an establishment like this so I can say it's safe bet when you don't know about other eateries.  Price is as you would expect and competes with Applebees.

62,Mike O.,"Park Ridge, IL",177,690,437.0,4.0,2012-11-01,"I've been coming here for years and even had the impression I had written about the place, but apparently I did not. This is a very busy Chili's, always packed when there's something happening at Allstate Arena. Still, it's a great place to go for lunch or dinner on a special occasion like a birthday or special treat for the kids on a job well done.  Best time to come is lunch on a Saturday or Sunday, as there is no wait usually and there's plenty of good tables or booths to choose from. While Chili's is a chain, at the same time it's got plenty of food choices for kids and grownups too. And the food is good too. They introduce new items and keep old faves I've come to love over the years. My #1 favorite is the jalapeno smokehouse burger, bringing a mix of spicy jalapenos and creamy ranch sauce on the burger, for a spicy-mellow combination. There are many other burger choices too, especially if you like bacon. My wife always goes with steak fajitas, and that fajita platter is big enough for 2, so we often bring tortillas and DIY fajita stuff home afterwards. For the kids, there's about a dozen choices available. Pizza is a frequent favorite, and Chili's pizza isn't bad for a thin crust, but by no means on a stellar level you'd get at Lou Malnati's or Gino's, but kids don't seem to care. Sides of corn on the cob, fries or fruit are available too. If you still got room for dessert and aren't at risk for cardiac problems, try the molten chocolate volcano at the end. It's big enough to split with 2-3 people unless you want to win the golden pig-snout trophy all for yourself. Once again, the texture and flavors of chocolate cake, hot fudge and melting vanilla ice cream make it a sensational choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosemont?start=60,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.9920000000000004,3.2000000000000006
72,Jeremy C.,"Chicago, IL",63,336,1.0,3.0,2012-11-11,"Having lived in cities for a number of years I've come to associate Chili's with the hot place to go on a Friday night... that is only if you live in the suburbs. And what on earth could be a bigger insult than being called a suburbanite..? Possibly terrorist, I'm not sure.  Anyway. I secretly love Chili's... Shhh just don't tell my fellow City-folk. Chili's has so much sodium in it but that's what makes it soooo good.  But on about this location... It gets very busy when there are events at the Allstate arena. A lot of peeps trying to grab a bite before/after their event. They have these little touch screens at each table now. It appears to be another way to generate revenue from kids (it charges for video games). The cool part about it is that you can pay on the machine without waiting for your water to drop a check. This is the first place I've ever seen that has this. I thought that was pretty neat..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosemont?start=60,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.9240000000000004,3.1600000000000006

38,Melissa L.,"Woodridge, IL",0,49,3.0,3.0,2013-01-01,"Not horrible, but not really impressed either. I took my mother to the Harlem Globetrotters game as her Christmas present so we decided to grab some dinner first. We were sat nearly immediately in a booth. Our server greeted us extremely promptly. There was something kind of off about her, she was rather awkward like she was uncomfortable, I'm thinking she was new? I think she was foreign, her name was Karolina or something. Anyways the service was alright, not great but pretty good. She kept refilling my drink and my mother's margarita was fantastic. Here comes the trouble, our food took really long, I'm assuming it's because it was a Friday night but still 25 minutes for a medium steak and some pasta? When our food finally arrived the steak was past well done, like I am talking no pink in sight and rather dry and flavorless. The cajun chicken pasta was delicious though, I definitely recommend it. The manager offered to replace the steak but we had no time so he comped it off our bill. All in all not a great experience but the drinks were good and our server may have been a little weird but she was extremely nice and she didn't pull the disappearing act like so many servers do so three stars and I'm hopeful that next time I am in the area my experience will be better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosemont?start=80,3.08,3.08,3.08,2.8920000000000003,3.0800000000000005

50,Natalie S.,"Des Plaines, IL",25,14,29.0,4.0,2014-07-30,"This place may not seem all that special, but I recommend Chili's for a great dinner for several different reasons. 1) Please do not underestimate the ability of Chili's to produce an amazing burger! They really are great. The one to really try is the southern smokehouse burger. It comes with their ancho-chili bbq sauce, onion strings, smoked cheddar, and maple bacon. Cooked to order and it is so delicious!  2) They have other very delicious food, especially the guacamole. You can order it to be prepared right at your table. Although i personally haven't tried the sizzling fajitas, they also look great, (brought to your table still sizzling in the cast iron pan) and the chicken  sandwich is really good. MY ADVICE TO SAVE MONEY! : **This place is definitely not all that cheap for a chain restaurant, so if you go in, make sure to bring with you a coupon (either printed or on your phone screen) for a free appetizer of chips and salsa or chips and queso dip that you get just by signing up on their website (takes five seconds). This makes your experience a little more worthwhile because you at least get some yummy food to munch on while you wait, and the chips and salsa are bottomless. **If you go with a friend, order from the two for twenty menu (you each get an entrée and share an appetizer). Even though it only offers the maple bacon burger, my solution to this has been to simply ask for a side of bbq sauce and order the onion strings and  jalapeño appetizer (delicious and comes with an amazing dipping sauce), save a few strings and jalapeños for the entree, and put them on the burger! Voila! You have just ordered the same burger for less money because you also got the appetizer, lol **You can also substitute sweet potato fries for the regular fries for something like a dollar or fifty cents. They are amazing! **You get a free molten cake on your birthday. You don't know gluttonous heaven until you eat this beast. *Really, make sure to sign up for their mailing list on their site. They send so many good deals, like free appetizers, desserts, and kids meals. You can't go wrong!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosemont?start=40,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.8640000000000003,3.1600000000000006

Unless there is something going on at the Allstate Arena, then that alters the parking and getting out situation a bit.  My last visit, I was there with my significant other, and while we were seated rather quickly, the service- rather a lack there of- was disappointing. We were seated and promptly given out utensils rolled in napkins, and told our server would be with us shortly. From that second, up until we left, we had maybe 6 different servers pass by us, and glance at our direction- but not approach us to see if we were being taken care of.  I get it, they have a policy that if utensils are placed, the table is being served, but when we did not even have our drinks and we were watching the waiters go by, note to those waiters, take a hint that something is not right. Who knows, your tip may just be bigger because of that- and if you become our server. (I speak from experience, I have been a waitress before and I know what it means to earn that tip).  Needless to say, when we stood up to leave, we approached and asked for a manager to notify why we were leaving. At that moment not only did the I believe GM offer to keep us there and provide our food, but another manager offered as well. We turned them down, because we did not need to be served in pity.

8,Gage N.,"Des Plaines, IL",2,25,5.0,1.0,2016-04-16,"This place is officially the worst restaurant I have ever had to deal with in my life. My personal experience but I have to say it a second time, the worst restaurant I have ever dealt with in my entire life. From when I was born until now. I can think of a few memorable incidents I've had at other restaurants and this place blew all of those out of the water.  The main issue is the service. It's beyond horrible. It's horrendous and despicable. The employees here are the most incompetent bunch of people I have ever seen. I'm not sure if incompetency is contagious here or if it's simply a requirement to get a job, but to put it in a very nice way (for their benefit) if you order 3 things, they'll forget one of them completely and the other two will surely be wrong. Not even remotely close to what you ordered.  I challenge anyone reading this to test this out for themselves.  I have been in here several times and have been so disgusted with the staff I have vowed to never step foot into any Chili's ever again! As an example, the last time I was here, I ordered a burger for take out, I came in to pick it up and after being ignored for a whopping 20 minutes despite the fact the restaurant wasn't busy at all, I only saw one table of 4 people and it was during the week around 4pm in the afternoon, anyway, there was an employee at the pick up counter not even five feet away from me who completely ignored me for ten minutes before walking away like I wasn't there, when she clearly saw me but just didn't care I guess. Didn't see her again, at least not until 3-4 other employees all saw me waiting and no one came over to even ask if I was being helped, I didn't see anyone doing their job. My blood was boiling and I was raging at this point and just wanted to leave. Finally that girl comes back, no apology for making me wait, just demands my phone number and name. I see someone from the back hand her a styrofoam box (presumably my food). I saw her opened it (I thought to make sure it's actually my order) but was too far away to see the food myself, she proceeds to bag it for me and hands it to me and I left, telling myself I will never return here.  So I get home, open the styrofoam box and am greeted with the most vile and disrespectful meal I have ever been served. My burger had no buns, no lettuce, no cheese, no anything. It was just a patty with what looked like a bite was taken out of it? Maybe not, maybe it was just a piece that was broken off and a tomato, but definitely not the definition of a burger.  I was fuming!  I drove back for an explaination and was greeted with hostility even from the manager who was called after I wanted a refund. They refused to give me a refund because according (to the manager at the time) I had left the restaurant so it's not their problem. In the end he ""offered"" to fix my order and give me coupons for future visits and I basically told him to shove his coupons where the sun doesn't shine and he finally gave me my money back. NEVER again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosemont?start=20,2.52,2.52,2.52,2.2760000000000002,2.52

However on several occasions they never put in my order which is a big inconvenience as I eat on my lunch break. They've comped the meal before, given me coupons, and they were always apologetic don't get me wrong. That's all well and good but you still need to fix the problem. I was forgiving when it only happened on a rare occasion. But once it started happening a lot I was done. The whole point of ordering that way is that it's ready for someone when they go in. That's precisely why these to go services are so popular. Because we live in this time where people are in a hurry, they are interacting less, and they just want to get their greasy junk food (no offense) go home and watch some Netflix. It defeats the purpose when you have to sit there and wait for it.  Fix whatever issues you have with receiving to go orders and I'll change my review. The food and service is really good. I would love to eat there again if I could count on my food being ready.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosemont,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72
99,Isamar Q.,"Melrose Park, IL",0,1,,1.0,2017-06-04,"Very disappointed my family & I went in today we were seated quickly and the hostess was nice but we sat at our assigned table and waited for our waiter who NEVER came 20 minutes later we asked the host, she had no idea where our server was or who was our server we saw her ask another employee who was taking care of the area we were sitting at and he also had no idea, my toddler was fussy and hungry so I got very annoyed and just told the host we were leaving! I can't believe it, they weren't that busy I saw servers wandering around some would see us just sitting there and didn't even bother to ask if we had been helped.. I will be calling the store manager. I was really looking forward to having dinner there today!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosemont,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72
85,Olivia R.,"Niles, IL",27,166,194.0,4.0,2017-06-18,"So i came here hungry! Like really hungry. The food was tasty and it satisfied my pregnant appetite  the trio fajitas (double shrimp and chicken) was really good! My husband had sunrise burger-was tasty and met the expectations of a picky burger eater. My daughter had chicken quesadilla (her go to food) and she was happy with it since she finished it.  However, i do not understand why we waited so much time for our food to come out. We waited for 30min on a Sunday at 2pm. The place had a lot of empty tables therefore the kitchen couldn't have been busy.  ***Also, Chill's are taking out items off their menu but the printed menu doesn't mention that or it's not updated yet.***",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosemont,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84
2,Cara L.,"Chicago, IL",0,34,27.0,1.0,2017-07-05,"One of my worst restaurant experiences ever! We used to go to this place once in a while for a weeknight meal and some drinks.  Not a special occasion place for me, but good comfort food. This was definitely my last visit. We came on a Thursday (about a month ago). Despite the half empty place, there was still a handful of people waiting for a table. Strange. Plus the whole place looked somewhat in disarray and disorganized. We were seated  10 min later and I ordered a Margarita (which was to be a special that day) only to learn that the promotion ended at 7:00 PM although nowhere in my e-mail or even the flier on the table was this mentioned (and we were seated at 7.15). When I confronted the manager about it (Jose, I think, was his name), he was very rude and condescending and pretty much told me in a rather hostile way that I was wrong! What happened to the ""customer is always right"" policy, especially when customer is right! (and believe me, I usually like my food and I'm not a complainer). If it wasn't for the fact that I have already ordered my drink and my husband and I were both starving, we would have left and never looked back. We decided instead to make it our last visit at this place (at least as long as Jose is managing it) and just make the best of it. On the positive note: our waitress was nice and polite and somewhat embarrassed by this whole ordeal, so she deserves the one star which I had to give out, anyway.

82,Yakin Sal M.,"Elk Grove Village, IL",86,47,338.0,5.0,2017-08-05,"It was my first time at a chillis restaurant. Yes it's hard to believe since they have been around for quite some time. The truth is that I always try to stay away from chain restaurants. Only because they are over priced and their food and drinks tend to not be good. I has the house margarita and yes it was sweeter than cracking open a lemonade. But we got the dinner for two for $35. I was there with my roommate. We each had a margarita and shared an appetizer. The Texas cheese fries, they were good. Came with melted cheese and bacon topped with jalapeños accompanied with ranch dressing. Very tasty I'd say. I had the chicken fajitas, I think it could've used a bit more chicken rather than a mountain of veggies but the season was on point. So no complaining there. He had the half a slab of ribs. He said they were juicy and the flavor was also on point. Finally we shared the Oreo molten cake for dessert. If you love chocolate like I do that's the way to go. Nice warm cake topped with vanilla ice cream and drizzled with hot chocolate sauce and crushed Oreo cookies. All in all it was good dinner for two for $35.  P.s. Yelpers be sure to give them a try and select their special. It really makes a difference if you are on a budget.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-rosemont,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
89,Amy W.,"Harvard, IL",5,4,1.0,4.0,2017-08-17,"This visit was significantly better than the last, partially due to the fact that we were actually seated at one of the many empty tables (unlike  the last, when an entire empty section plus more meant '20 minute wait).

84,Jim J.,"Park Ridge, IL",2103,247,732.0,3.0,2017-09-22,"This Chili's is pretty decent compared to chain wide standards.  They seem to be making a solid effort to stay relevant by adding craft beers, more trendy food items and remodeling their restaurants.  This location got the makeover sometime in the last few year so it is looking new and hip - in a corporate way.  The seats are comfortable and the place is spacious, yet not too loud.  We have always had great servers and they keep drink refills coming.  Be sure to place an order for your favorite Coke concoction on the freestyle machine. The food is what you would expect for a fast causal restaurant.  They have a huge selection of apps, but we always opt for the bottomless tortilla chips.  The chips are freshly fried and come with a zesty salsa.  You can get refills of the basket of chips (don't be embarrassed, people do it all the time).   I rarely am hungry by the time my food comes out.  Salads and burgers are both pretty reliable, but terrible for you.  The health stats they publish online are a little concerning to say the least.  I had the Chipotle Chicken and Waffles on my last visit and feel it missed the mark.  The chicken was tiny little stringy pieces with a lot of batter.  The waffle was super sweet in an overkill manner.  It was all covered with a spicy chipotle syrup that kind of covered everything up.  I ate two of them and got rid of the rest - good thing I filled up on the chips and salsa.
