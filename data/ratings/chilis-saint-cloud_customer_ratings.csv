32,Tim J.,"Venice, FL",8,28,2.0,1.0,2012-12-12,"I don't know what happened to chilis, they used to be a great eating establishment.  Now every experience my wife and I have had there has been absolutely terrible.  Let me start off with the lack of service from the hostess or should I say hostesses because there is four of them at any given time all to busy talking to each other to help or greet their patrons.     Next comes the ambiance, its a dirty booth always with unclean silverware and obvious that children have been snotting all over everything.  Next comes the attitudes of the server's all of them have gotten orders wrong or completely forgotten about any request you ask of them and they can't be bothered to hang up their phones to visit their sections.     Then the food always arrives with the appetizer ( glad they aren't rushing you out the door).  The two for one margaritas are now just a shot and a complete waste of money. On to the most important part the food, its horrible I have had everything in the menu over the years and its all gone done hill.  I recently ordered their ribs which they are known for and what I got was a plate full of cartilage filled overdone stuck on the bone nasty ribs. My wife at the same time ordered a steak and got a gristled mess of fat and veins, she left more on the plate than she could stomach to eat. Not To mention the microwaved vegetables.     In the end you can have a way better dining experience  for your money at BJ's brewhouse or bonefish grill, they both have great cultured ambiance and amazing service and the food is prepared by actual chefs not microwaving line cooks. Unless wasting your money and having a bad dining experience is your thing then by all means eat at chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-saint-cloud?start=20,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116

36,Caroline J.,"Kissimmee, FL",4,22,,1.0,2013-02-20,"My husband and I used to come to Chilis a lot because it's only 5 minutes away. The food was decent and well-priced and their all-day 2 for 1 margaritas were awesome. But within the past year we have stopped going to Chilis all together. The last few times we braved the crowds, screaming children and sticky tables/menus/seats, we were served some of the worst food I have ever seen in a restaurant. I could have gotten better chicken tacos at Taco Bell. The meat, be it my chicken or my husband's steak, was all fat and veins and very little edible meat. I spit more of my chicken into my napkin than I actually ate. The food almost always would come out room temperature with the hard sheen of having been microwaved and then left to sit. To top it all off, the service was terrible those past few times (trying to get your waiter/waitress to look in your direction is an almost Herculean task). Even the margaritas seemily stopped being alcoholic. We will most certainly never visit this Chilis location again and more than likely won't step foot in any other Chilis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-saint-cloud?start=20,2.212,2.212,2.212,2.212,2.212

The order was correct except a couple of wrong dip sides.  The food was not burnt, squished into the containers and was appropriately sized.  Maybe last time was a fluke or maybe this store manager reads these reviews.  Whatever the case, the food seemed to be prepared with care and was presented well, was correct, and tasted great.

I ordered a smokehouse burger. simple right? Order took 40 minutes.  people who arrived after us received their food before us. I had to turn back my sons meal because the burger was dry and inedible. Bill the manager apologized and said that he would put in another order. waited another 20.

Yes, they offered to make it then, but we ordered ahead of time to avoid a half hour wait!  have had mixed service here.  The servers seem to bust their butts, and the food is good.  I have had more issues with the wait, tables not being bussed and hostesses hanging out instead of focusing on their job.  On the occasions with a long wait, our waitor has been awesome and the food delicious as well.  I really enjoy the new southwest menu, too!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-saint-cloud?start=20,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002

We got a table for seven and our drink and appetizer order was made quickly. The food and drink were delivered promptly. Three of us ordered burgers, which were cooked well and tasted great. The other four in our party each ordered fajitas for two (according to my sis and her husband, the ""for two"" offering was perfectly sized). Instead, they received the individually sized order. Apparently, the waitress thought they each wanted to split a single order which made no sense. Despite the misunderstanding, the food was good and the easy pay system at our table was really convenient ( no wait for a check ). I should add that our server was relatively new on the job so I give her plenty of allowance for being a little green. Serving is a hard job ad I certainly recognize that. All in all, a great place to have a nice meal. We will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-saint-cloud?start=20,2.768,2.768,2.768,2.768,2.768

The service can be really hit or miss. Sometimes it's great, sometimes the server is nonexistent. I would say my biggest complaint is the take-out service. It is... Really bad. The website often goes down forcing you to call your order in. They don't answer the phone. Seriously. I called 6 times one night before they answered.

21,Chris C.,"Orlando, FL",2,18,3.0,2.0,2015-11-23,"Hmmm... how do I say this without sounding like I'm someone pulling a race card ? So I'm going to ask all of you for your opinion. Here is the situation. . I walk in and sit at the bar and I've worked at restaurants myself and during the day you will always have your daytime regulars so those are the people that for the most part pay the day shifts people's bills ... but when you sit down at any restaurant your suppose to be treated like you at least exist. Not only did the bartender walk by and not ""notice"" me like 5 times as he kept walking passed me.. ""There was only 4 people at the bar area"" but he never even offered me the nachos and salsa when it's complimentary at this place and when asked he almost rolled his eyes as if that's all I was going to order. . And when he came back he gave me a look and said, "" are you going order  anything sir""? with a very condescending type attitude? Now I "" get it "" I'm sure in this place you get alot of people that walk in just drink the 2 for 1 beers and eat the hell out of the nachos and the salsa which I believe is out of this world at this place but I've never  felt so characterized in all my life. I stayed for about 4 hrs watching the football game and not once did the bartender or the oncoming bartender ask me if I wanted more chips or salsa but yet I literally watched them ask the women next to me  if she wanted them a couple that came after me  was given them without even asking and everyone across the bar from me that came in after me never even had to ask for them.  So you tell me ? Oh yeah.. did I actually order food you ask ? The answer is yes.. I ordered the tacos Ranchero which are very good. Now is this about nachos and salas ???  Nah...Not at all... its not about the food or how much or little I ordered but how I was treated as a customer by these people.  I walked out of there and never felt so profiled and so bad that I will never go back again.. I even pointed it out to the couple next to me and I could feel that they even felt uncomfortable because this bartender would walk right by me to give them a doggy bag to bring home the extra chips and salsa yet never even offered me anything. Now I know osceola county and saint cloud florida has and large Hispanic population and I admit.. some of them will take advantage like anyone would if something was free but it was more of how they made me feel and how they just characterized me as soon as I sat down that bothered me. With that being said the food there is still good and would I go to a chilies again... absolutely. . One or two bad apples don't mean the whole bunch are bad but I got to be honest I felt horrible when I walked out. Hope if you go to this place you have a better experience then I did. As always... love..laugh...and eat !!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-saint-cloud?start=20,,,,,
11,Louise S.,"Kissimmee, Orlando, FL",344,557,2626.0,3.0,2015-11-24,"I am a little torn on if this is a 3 or a 4. Service as nice as they are is always, always slow. No matter if you seat in the restaurant or the bar area it is always Slow. The upside to the bar area is free chips and salsa which I always order anyway but its slow and very loud. Unless you are ordering drinks from the bar area it seems like they never remember to come back and check to see if you need a refill. I guess since a refill is free and something from the bar is not it, makes a difference. The location unless you are going early always has a wait. And they will not seat you until everyone in your party has arrived.  It has been nicely remodeled as they are doing now to most Chili's. The bathrooms should be looked after more often. The food is decent. The burgers are always cooked to my liking. Soup is great. Love the fajitas. The rib eye steak is always prepared well. They have a good selection of salads and side dishes for my hubby who is vegan. The problem with the food here is if one persons food is ready they do not bring it out until all is ready so someone is getting cold food 9 times out of 10. Dessert is always good here. But, on our last visit which was my daughter's birthday the waitress said that they no longer sing to the customers which was a downer for her. I am sure I will go back again. At least for the good drink specials.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-saint-cloud,,,,,

I had a seat at the bar, the server was there right away and was fast, friendly and attentive throughout my time there.  Most everyone here seemed to be locals, including a few at the bar who knew the server by name, and asked for the TVs to be switched to their preferred programming. I had a steak which came with broccoli and also ordered the fries and a Sprite.  It came out in good time, and the quality of the meal was good, but not great or better.  As I was leaving, I asked the server where I could find a Starbucks or a place with free WiFi.  She struggled a bit, as I guess St. Cloud is a bit far off the beaten path and there's not a huge demand for WiFi here, but she did direct me to Kissimmee where she said they'd just recently built a new Starbucks location.

When my plate arrived it looks like someone spilled BBQ sauce all over it wasn't a nice presentation of the meal. I had to wipe down my plate before eating. The ribs were ok nothing to rave about my mashed potatoes were ok tasted like boxed mashed potatoes not fresh potatoes. The best part were the fried pickles. Service was ok the waitress never came back to check on us once the food was delivered only to collect the plates. I will try another place for dinner, next time.  Update went on 1/27/17 party of 7, everything has changed for the better! Our server Tony was fantastic very attentive and great personality. We ordered different meals I had chicken fajitas and the rest of my party had the ribs everything was great and I tried the ribs they were great!

The ingredients was fresh tasting, avocado was nice as well. Food came at a decent time, didn't have to wait very long. The waitress was nice and helpful, we didn't have to ask for anything like napkins, silverware, etc.  The place itself was pretty busy which is normal for this time after church.
