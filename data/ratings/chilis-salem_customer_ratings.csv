36,Barry S.,"Pelham, NH",2,104,,1.0,2013-04-07,"We recently visited this Chili's restaurant late one Saturday. It was one of, if not the worst dining experiences we've ever had. At around 9:00PM, well after dinner rush, the place was a bit less than half full. We figured it would be a quick process to order eat and exit. Boy were we wrong. It started okay with a quick drink order. I also ordered a cup of their southwestern spicy chicken soup with chicken and charizo sausage. It came out piping hot and had a nice kick to it. So far so good. By then we had put in our entree order, mine being their baby back ribs, and my wife ordering their buffalo chicken sandwich. And here is when things went downhill. Close to 40 minutes later, no entrees. By now the place was maybe just 25% full. Our server had come by twice over this period promising our entrees would arrive soon. Yet 40 minutes later, customers who came in after us were being served, while we waited. At one point our server brought entrees to one of these later arrived parties, glanced over at us, and quickly turned away in what appeared to be embarrassment. Minutes later the manager came to our table apologizing for the delay, but not offering an explanation. He promised our order would be out soon and that he would pick up the tab after a 35 minute wait, which was really about 45 now. Okay we thought, free food. Well about 15 minutes the food finally arrived and again the manager noted there would be no check. If this is how it ended, it would have been alright. But the food quality was poor to pitiful. We had the feeling they rushed the food out to try and satisfy us. Wrong!!! The ribs were dry, especially the half rack with a rub. And there was little meat on the BBQ ribs. This was the poor scoring entree. The pitiful score fell on the buffalo chicken sandwich. The bun was stale, and what should have been a chicken patty dripping in buffalo sauce was a bland dry patty with a single, hardly noticeable teaspoon of the sauce. We pointed this out to the server who was really embarrassed, offered to take it back for a new sandwich, but by now we couldn't afford to wait another 45 minutes. We ate what we had and left. It is important to note that our server was fine throughout this visit, full of apologies. Whatever the issue was, it was all in the kitchen. The manager did the right thing as well by picking up the check. For these reasons they get a very generous 1.5 stars, rounded down to one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-salem?start=20,1.5720000000000003,1.5720000000000003,1.5720000000000003,1.5720000000000003,1.5720000000000003
26,Matthew A.,"Rockingham County, NH",717,1990,1299.0,2.0,2013-04-14,"Here is my 6 year update.  I had actually forgot that I had been here and Yelped this place.  Guess mentally blocked the bad experience last time.  Well in 6 years, not much has changed. It is still; the standard classic of a chain restaurant. Still heavy greasy, over salted, overcooked food. The Margaretta was eh- pre-measured to the drop, and overly sweet.  The young high school waitress with pink hair actually did an ok job, was attentive.  We sat in the bar area, and just chilled after a long day.  We did not enjoy the food. So many better places to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-salem?start=20,1.6720000000000002,1.6720000000000002,1.6720000000000002,1.6720000000000002,1.6720000000000002
33,Jacqueline M.,"Derry, NH",17,38,29.0,3.0,2013-07-28,"When my fiancé and I decided on a night out we picked chili's because it was out of our normal region for restaurants. After a 20-25 minute drive we were greeted by a man in torn jeans drinking a soda at the door. The real host was too busy writing something down to take notice of us. The place is loud, like louder than your average restaurant. You go to relax and end up with a headache from the screaming children and kitchen noises.  I would rate the food a B+ at best. The burger was undercooked then what was ordered, and the fajitas were chewy and covered in inedible skin. Even the ""cheese sticks"" were greasy. They claim to recycle their grease, well apparently it is recycled onto their products. They have a 2 for 20$ deal that most chain places have these days, but your better off visiting another chain with this deal. They did not have that many options in the appetizers section and the choices in the entree section are your standard fare. At least at some other chains then you might be able to hear your server. Overall the server was a nice enough girl, and as attentive as most servers are. It was a bit difficult to hear her over the noise level, and she did seem as if she had a hard time hearing us at points. She was fairly quick and made sure to get us our food out quickly, which is a saving grace. Overall from the moment we walked in it was one of the least relaxing places I had been in a long time, and I left feeling sick and with a headache. Not somewhere to go if you want to have a date, at least not in the evenings. Better for a large group of ""the guys"" hanging out, or perhaps for lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-salem?start=20,1.836,1.836,1.836,1.836,1.836
38,Steve B.,"Haverhill, MA",18,8,,4.0,2013-08-17,"This is a typical chain restaurant that you see up 28.  I've been here numerous times and one thing is consistent, the wait staff is very good.   I have never had an issue with any waitress at this place, and have had a bunch.  The food is hit or miss ranging from average to pretty good.  4 out of 5 times, the food is exactly how I expect it, but that 1 out of 5 isn't even all that bad.  Maybe a tad overcooked or whatever, but still good.  What I like about this Chilis is it's never super busy but not empty enough to wonder what's wrong with the place.  On weekend nights you can expect a 15-20 minute wait, but other nights you can get right in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-salem?start=20,1.8720000000000003,1.8720000000000003,1.8720000000000003,1.8720000000000003,1.8720000000000003

I generally like chilis food but there is always something yucky about the food at this one. The staff is usually pleasant. Sometimes not. The biggest pet peeve that I had was that they advertised free wifi all over the place but I didn't see any wifi on my cell in the bar area. I asked bout it and they explained that the wifi just doesn't reach the bar area.

40,Mark B.,"Derry, NH",2,33,3.0,2.0,2014-01-26,"We've been to this one a few times - its sub-par compared to other Chili's. Food is hit or miss - but we've had pretty good luck overall. Our most recent visit was for lunch shortly after open - sat in the bar area - we sat there so I could watch Sportscenter - about 2 mins after sitting down - half the TV's in the bar froze and stayed frozen for the remainder of our visit and nobody seemed to care. With no TV to watch I noticed the table was sticky so we switched to a less sticky table.  Decided to get on the ""free wifi"" - and it was also not working. Go figure. We ordered our food - took a bit but wasn't bad overall. Typical Chili's. Our waitress was pretty cool and service was good but there weren't many other tables seated. Went to the bathroom on the way out and found the men's bathroom was full of water - literally - water on every corner of the floor compliments of leaky faucet. Seeing that made me wonder about the rest of the place.  If I had seen it prior to eating - I would have left.  If I see a flooded bath at 10P I can blame it on a long day or a drunk guy - but 45 mins after opening is tough to justify. Again - nobody seemed to care that water was flowing out from under the bathroom door. The place overall has a ""blah"" feeling. The staff does the best they can and the service and food is good. If I had to guess - the overall problem with this place is management.  You can't expect the 20-something wait staff to fix the core problems with a restaurant.  Leaky faucets and TV/wifi down are things a good manager would get taken care of immediately.  I'm sure we'll return but I'm in no hurry. I'll try to remember to update.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-salem?start=40,1.6720000000000002,1.6720000000000002,1.6720000000000002,1.6720000000000002,1.6720000000000002

8,Wei W.,"Lexington, MA",131,275,1183.0,1.0,2016-02-06,"We were shopping in the plaza across the road and began to get ""hangry"" - frustrated with the crowds and extremely moody due to an empty stomach / low blood sugar. So I suggested that we run across the road to this Chili's location. I didn't realize how big of a mistake this would be. We entered to seven or so groups of families waiting to be seated. Since it was just the bf and me, we opted to sit in the bar area in hopes for faster service. How wrong we were. It seemed that there was only one server for the entire bar area, so we didn't even get our order taken until 10 minutes after we sat down. Another 10 minutes, our water arrived, and we finally placed our order.  How long does it take to make a side salad?  25 minutes later, the side salad came out. Are you KIDDING me? I can't imagine it takes 25 minutes to throw some leaves, goat cheese, and vinaigrette on the plate. As I'm writing this, we still haven't gotten our entrees yet and it's going on 45 minutes of us having been in this establishment. This is a frank reminder of why we don't ever come to Chili's. Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-salem,1.84,1.84,1.84,,1.8400000000000003
18,John T.,"North Andover, MA",834,55,96.0,3.0,2016-03-03,Chilis isn't too bad. Had some bad experiences but not at this one. Its open later than most food spots. We couldn't find anything else for a wednesday night. I got a burrito (as usual) which was better than I figured it'd be. Waitress was nice. I'm very neutral about chilis.

13,Alexandra B.,"Haverhill, MA",30,87,18.0,2.0,2016-03-29,"Chili's was always my favorite chain restaurant. I love Tex-Mex. This location, however, is getting worse and worse the more I come here. The problem is the service. Though some say the food is a hit or miss, I for one never had any issues with the food here. I love the southwestern egg rolls, fajitas, and Big Mouth Sliders.  But waiting 45 minutes just for the appetizer is unacceptable.  Hopefully now that they're hiring, the situation will improve.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-salem,1.84,1.84,1.84,,1.8400000000000003

17,Mark B.,"Salem, NH",10,12,8.0,1.0,2016-08-09,Never really had great service when eating here.  The food is always sub par and not great.  This last time we sat in the bar lounge area on the high top tables for lunch.  During the week we only have around an hour for a lunch break and we ended up being there for almost an hour and 1/2.  The double burger lunch was meh.  I asked for the checks and then had to remind the waiter about the checks 15 minutes later.  Add this to a place I never go back to again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-salem,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0

The food was very good, but the waitress wasn't. She had to be reminded multiple times to bring limes for one of us, pickles for another and sour cream for another.  When we were done, one of us asked for a container to bring their lunch home and she said ""I have to wait to get a container"".  HUH? When she brought the three checks, she just dumped them in the middle of the table and left.  A good waitress would have handed the correct check to the correct customer.  This was very tacky !!!!

31,Paula M.,"Amherst, NH",0,2,,1.0,2016-08-22,"I've eaten at many Chili's over the years and recognize the chain to be middle of the road and do not have higher expectations than that.  The Chilis in Salem is really far below the average Chili's.  I took my daughter and 3 grandchildren there today for lunch.  The first thing I noticed at the table we were directed to, was that is was dirty, having a layer of greasy scum type material on all the wooden surfaces which encompass the tile top.  The tile was less than stellar as well.  I asked to move to another table which was about the same.  The tables are all filthy.  Even the windows were disgusting with grime and finger prints and in some areas food drips.  I mean I know kids will touch windows, I had 5, but these windows look they haven't been washed in a very long time.  Tables, you could scratch a name into the grease with a fingernail!  The manager came over when we said we were unhappy with the food and did credit one dish which was the fajitas.  Poorly prepared, certainly not grilled, as the menu indicated.  ""Oh we got rid of all the grills, we don't grill anything here anymore, just heat it on conveyor belts!""  Yuck, um your menu says grilled.  It was all just horrible from start to finish, and this is the first time I've ever written a restaurant review that was negative.  I'm not a complainer!!  Never again!  Server was OK, thus the 1 star.  Took forever for them to produce this food, poorly prepared, the place was empty!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-salem?start=20,1.72,1.72,1.72,,1.7200000000000002
7,Kristin K.,"Lawrence, MA",1,73,2.0,1.0,2016-09-17,"I'm not surprised this location has only a 2-star rating. It's not management's fault their patrons consist of lowlifes who bring small children and have no problem drinking in the company of their small children then driving home.  It is, however, management's fault when patrons have to listen to waitstaff having words about where people are being seated.  Second, I have food allergies. I told our server upon ordering my steak that I have allergies and my steak need to be ""naked"". No seasonings, no marinades, just salt and pepper. I also told her I wanted to trade BOTH sides for one side salad and I still got charged extra. This doesn't make sense to me, considering the side salad was nothing to write home about and definitely didn't cost most than a baked potato and side of broccoli. Third, the side salad, to my surprise, was loaded with cheese. Usually only Caesars have cheese. I have a dairy allergy so I was picking out all the cheese, the waitress noticed and got me a new salad. That was the one good thing she did. I never send back food because you never know who that's going to piss off. Regardless, it wasn't worth the extra buck for about an ounce of lettuce and a couple of slices of onion and cucumber. Due to my allergies, I brought my own dressing which ended up being the best part of my meal. Fourth, the steak. It was a ribeye and tasted previously frozen. I don't care that it's not a steakhouse. If you can't do it right, take it off the menu. I ordered medium rare, it was closer to medium well but I hadn't eaten yet that day and my friend was already digging into her entree so I said it was fine. I didn't want to eat alone because my friend would've been done her lunch by the time my probable floor steak would've arrived.   Lastly, my friend had 2 to-go containers and our server didn't offer her a bag. She was LUCKY we left her 15%. We had to ask the very nice hostess for a bag on our way out.  It just wasn't a good experience. Lousy service, arguing waitstaff, overpricing and mediocre food at best. Since my friend enjoyed her food, I'll say mediocre because mine sucked. There are so many places to go in the immediate area, don't waste your money here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-salem,1.72,1.72,1.72,,1.7200000000000002
10,Justine R.,"Haverhill, MA",0,62,19.0,1.0,2016-11-30,I'd actually give this a half star. Food was cold as if it came out of the refrigerator. The manager only comp one meal.

5,Andrew S.,"Orlando, FL",12,13,1.0,5.0,2016-12-11,Legit the best Tex mex in the United States. Chilis in Salem is a great family owned small town restaurant! I love the family atmosphere. I love all the old family air looms from the owner hanging on the wall and ceiling. It brings me back to my childhood on the border. I love going to chilis and drinking corona Rita's until I pass out. The chips and salsa is probably the best iv ever had and the fajitas are breathtakingly delicious. I always give my compliments to the great chefs here. They do it better than anywhere else.  11/10 stars There is a reason why there are always a lot of people here. It's a family owned small town mom and pop Tex mex restaurant that serves up great food.  It's worth the drive here.

I had mostly seen Subway Sandwich Shops and gas stations rated below two on yelp, I found this diamond in the rough. A major chain restaurant with two stars. After reading other reviews, I had to check it out. I will preface this with the fact that I arrived at lunch, and not during peak hours. Other than awkwardly standing at the front entrance for 10 minutes waiting for someone to come to seat me, it was actually a good experience. The bartender Mandy was polite, made small talk, and was attentive. Of course I was the only customer sitting at the bar. Food came out right away, and was very good. The staff were otherwise polite.
