6,Sarah M.,"Fort Meade, MD",64,102,14.0,1.0,2012-03-16,"We have been to this Chili's several times and have been incredibly disappointed and upset each time. The first, my salmon was grossly undercooked and I sent it back and it came back more than well done. They had to toss the fish and start over completely. Sometimes we eat out because we're out running errands, and so we need to sit and feed our kids right then and there- when this happens, we try to order the kids' food with our drink order and ask for it to come out right away. Three times now we've tried this at Chili's, and each time they've taken 20-30 minutes to get the kids' food out (we're talking a corn dog, grilled cheese, and orange wedges here.) I just have too much to complain about to write about this place. I don't know why we keep going back since their service is outrageously bad, and has been on every single visit we've been there. They have been rude, they've brought out undercooked/way overcooked food, they take an extreme amount of time to bring simple orders no matter how busy they are....and Chili's food isn't all that much to write home about in the first place. THey brought out frozen ""lava"" cake when I went with friends, and argued with me when I ordered the big mouth bites on whole wheat bread with lettuce added (since directly under them on the menu it says all burgers have a choice of whole wheat or sesame seed, and you can add lettuce....so I did.) Well it came out as 4 crumbly, grisly pieces of hamburger on a bun that was cut into 4 pieces, without the lettuce. She argued with me and spent so much time explaining to me WHY I ordered incorrectly, until I asked her to get the menu so I could show her. They did bring it out correctly after that, but who cares. At that point, we'd been there for an hour, I hadn't eaten, my kids were finished with their meal (and that's after it took 30 minutes from ordering for it to arrive) and she embarrassed me and made me feel totally stupid.  Someone remind me NOT to go back there, no matter how pressed for time we are!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-san-angelo?start=20,1.924,1.924,1.924,1.924,1.9240000000000002
3,S R.,"Lexington, MA",36,115,8.0,2.0,2013-01-28,I don't know why we keep coming here for a quick lunch. The waitress took forever to come take our order. When we finished our appetizer and asked for a chip refill our meals came before the chips. We were told one of our friends startsers would be later due to mixingup the order but his managed to come out before everyone else's. waitress rarely checked on us for refills or the like. No tip.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-san-angelo?start=20,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152
4,Big J.,"San Angelo, TX",0,23,3.0,2.0,2013-03-17,My family and I went for St. Patricks day. They were not to busy. We asked to set in the bar so we could watch sports. The table was dirty. The wait staff was inattentive and slow. Our waitress did clean the table when we asked. She took our drink order and went to get them. Our menus were all stickey. Looked like no one has been whipping them off on a regular bases. She brought us our drinks and took our order. She brought us our chips and salsa but no napkins or silverware. When the food came they put a ton of pepper on my daughters childs portion of steamed broccoli.? They did exchange it. All and all the food was good the service was a little slow and they need a little basic housekeeping.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-san-angelo?start=20,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.12
5,J.M. F.,"Robert Lee, TX",1,2,,3.0,2014-04-02,Had the baby back ribs which tasted ok but the plate was very hot and the ribs were only room temperature. I assume they were microwaved. The only thing that impressed me was the waitress as she gave excellent service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-san-angelo?start=20,,,,,
29,Tim H.,"Aledo, TX",46,34,12.0,2.0,2014-06-12,Only place I've ever visited that brought me five dirty glasses that looked as though they had just taken them off someone else's table and brought it directly to me. Food is typically room temperature at best while the plate feels like it arrived frome hell.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-san-angelo,,,,,
27,Cat H.,"Dallas, TX",115,40,,3.0,2014-09-25,"The service was spotty during my last visit to this location.  The fries for our order came out cold, and we requested hot ones.  The waitress said she put in the order for new ones, but they never came.  When we ordered desert, the manager came over to apologize that the fries never came out and offered us free desert and gave us coupons.  It ended up working out, but hot fries would have been nice.  Their chips and salsa and hot molten lava cake are still the best.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-san-angelo,,,,,
28,Laura P.,"Manteca, CA",46,6,,1.0,2014-10-18,"We sat in the Bar area, and our waitress took forever to get anything we ordered. My Shirley Temple never came, I finally asked after 25 mins. Bad service..and probably wont be going there for awhile till they can be a little faster!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-san-angelo,,,,,
2,Niblet C.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,49,2.0,2.0,2014-10-26,"Ordered California Grilled Chicken Flat Bread to go.  I've had it before and really liked it.  In this case, it was horrible.  The cashier noticed it did not have avocado on top.  He took it back to kitchen and had it added.  Got home and it had just a few tiny pieces of chicken, NO bacon, no tomato sauce that I could taste and a TINY bit of pico de gallo.  Why would the take out order be of such poor quality?  I will be reluctant to order anything at Chili's again - especially take out.  What a disappointment. One friend liked the potato soup.  The buffalo chicken salad was okay, but chicken had too much vinegar for her taste.  Greens were fresh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-san-angelo?start=20,,,,,
20,Rob C.,"San Angelo, TX",4,17,29.0,2.0,2015-01-31,I swear...the people working here are Clueless. I got an extra charge on my ticket and the waitress couldn't explain it and wouldn't take it off. She blamed corporate. I'm sure it's a way to lad their tips!Hummmm.. never saw a manager!  This place is worst and worst!  I suggest anywhere but chilies...they need a over haul!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-san-angelo,,,,,
24,Michael Y.,"San Angelo, TX",0,24,,5.0,2015-07-20,"I highly suggest the rice and beans, cornbread (has cheese), and mashed potatoes (gravy).  It was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-san-angelo,,,,,
1,Don J.,"Sterling City, TX",4,16,,1.0,2015-08-02,Was the worse meals.  Had baked potato soup kinda it was not soup it was a glob of something not sure what. Service was really bad no silverware had a long wait for what we did get.    Really really bad,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-san-angelo?start=20,,,,,
26,Savanna T.,"San Angelo, TX",8,15,1.0,1.0,2015-08-16,Honestly let down every other time I go here. Either poor service or mediocre food. At high prices. The waitresses like to bring back large bills hoping you will give them bigger tips. Very poor service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-san-angelo,,,,,
23,Lee K.,"Fort Worth, TX",4,19,7.0,2.0,2015-10-18,"Typical Chilis fare. However the place needs a thorough scrubbing! The tables, menus and ""Ziosks"" were all filthy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-san-angelo,,,,,
0,T. Dean M.,"San Angelo, TX",1,10,,4.0,2015-11-01,"If you're plant-based, there are a couple of items on the menu that are easily adaptable. We got the Margarita Chicken Fresh Mex Bowl today with NO chicken, chips, cheese or margarita sauce. We added a black bean patty, guacamole and salsa with a side of hot corn tortillas. I didn't eat the rice because it's very oily, but otherwise, it's pretty good diggings!  Jade was our waitress. She was very pleasant and did a great job of managing our dish in the kitchen.  She gets 5 stars!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-san-angelo?start=20,,,,,
19,Jon G.,"Sonora, TX",24,92,184.0,3.0,2016-04-11,Service was good. Food was bland and a bit small for the price. Restaurant was clean and we were sat quickly for a Sunday at lunch. It's a chain restaurant so food should and could have been better. It's ok for a quick bite but I was not impressed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-san-angelo,,,,,
25,A P.,"Plano, TX",0,2,,1.0,2016-05-22,Sad to say restaurant in poor condition. Sets torn. Had Hamburgers. Buns were hard. Floors and tables dirty.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-san-angelo,,,,,
18,Carrie K.,"San Angelo, TX",0,4,,1.0,2016-06-21,"Seriously, I ordered a bowl of enchilada soup. The cup it came in was barely half way full. Did one of the employees eat my soup?!?!. Normally I'd call, however I've been moving all day and I'm exhausted. This is ridiculous!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-san-angelo,,,,,
22,Scott H.,"San Angelo, TX",0,21,1.0,4.0,2016-07-04,"I eat here often and the majority of the time the food is ok - good.  The service is always great.  Today I ate here and was waited on by Cinnamon who was working the bar area.  She went out of her way to make sure I was taken care of.  I ordered the Sour Cream Chicken Enchiladas and they came out hot and were very tasty.  I do recommend this place.  It is a chain, but the locals that run it make it feel more like a local place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-san-angelo,,,,,
17,Lynn W.,"San Angelo, TX",0,12,3.0,1.0,2016-08-08,We ate supper here yesterday. My husband ate the salmon with ancho. He definitely had food poisoning! Poor guy. I have never seen him so sick. It hit him about 3 hours after he ate. The food use to be so good here. Very disappointed!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-san-angelo,,,,,
15,Joe A.,"San Angelo, TX",26,52,37.0,2.0,2016-10-15,Unacceptably filthy. Floors were littered and our table was dirty. We walked past tables that were disgusting and the staff just walked past it. Waited Five minutes and no one got to us so we left.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-san-angelo,,,,,
21,Kyle R.,"Georgetown, TX",0,3,,1.0,2016-12-02,"For 6 months we came to this place every week or two weeks, it started out great the first few trips. However, the last 4 trips have been terrible across the board. It's been slow, the waiting staff has been rude and doesn't even write down the orders. 3 trips in a row had over or undercooked food. In fact, my steak was cooked rare when I asked for medium. When it came back it was STILL barely medium rare. My girlfriends asparagus had multiple that were both burnt and undercooked which I didn't even know was possible. Idk what the hell has changed but things need to get changed, fast. Chilis has lost a loyal customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-san-angelo,,,,,
12,Cece S.,"Big Spring, TX",23,1,,4.0,2017-02-27,"I had my doubts about Chilis because of the reviews I had read. To my surprise our dining experience was better than expected. The food was excellent and our waiter was very good and attentive.  The only thing that was a turnoff was a couple of waitresses were clearing the table across from us and we could hear one of them complaining that the people had opened all the menus and ""they all say the same thing"". She was loud and obnoxious.  I would definitely recommend this Chilis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-san-angelo,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28
16,Becky C.,"San Angelo, TX",7,12,,2.0,2017-05-13,"I wonder if the manager of this restaurant lives in a cave with no TV or social media!!  Crazy busy weekend with Mother's Day, graduation and summer shopping crowds and they did NOT have enough staff to provide satisfactory service. Our server was great, apologetic and frazzled. He did the best he could but I blame the manager for our slow service, drink mix ups, food errors and just a general bad lunch experience. Not the first time I have encountered this at Chilis.  Get it right or shut the doors.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-san-angelo,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28
13,Jordan L.,"Nashville, TN",124,47,1.0,2.0,2017-05-20,"I LOVE chili's, but this one is the worst one I've ever been to. Been there 3 times and every time it has been extremely slow service. The food is not near as good as the other franchises I've been to. Just not pleased.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-san-angelo,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24
14,Megan P.,"San Angelo, TX",0,2,,5.0,2017-10-15,"Always good to go food! Now with curbside I don't even have to get the kids out of the car! Easy, convenient and delicious!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-san-angelo,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28
10,Katrina G.,"Eldorado, TX",0,5,2.0,5.0,2017-11-01,"From the prompt and friendly service to the delicious food, my son and I were impressed with the San Angelo Chili's. It was the lunch rush, but we were seated and served quickly. Our server had a great attitude and a quick sense of humor. I had the chicken guacamole sandwich. It was enough for two, for sure. My son took the other 1/2back to his dorm for later. He had a hamburger, and, because it was piled high with ingredients, he cut it in half. He made the comment that he didn't think he'd ever cut a burger in half.:-) I would definitely recommend this location of Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-san-angelo,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
11,Scott H.,"San Angelo, TX",0,1,2.0,1.0,2018-01-03,Normally it's always good but here lately not so much. There is always empty tables and still have to wait to be seated. We sat at the table for almost 10 min before waiter even asked for drink order. Had to look for him for refills. The food took almost 40 min to get. Wasn't even busy there was dirty tables around manager was walking around not even trying to help at all. Just looked at the tables and keep walking. Even when we set empty cups on edge of the table didn't even ask if we needed refills just walked right on by. The food was about average been better that is for sure. The waiter might have been new but needed more training on customer service that is a fact.  Once we got the food we never saw him again so not sure what the deal was. There was several people that was waiting on service and the food longer than it should have been.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-san-angelo,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
