21,Buttermilk P.,"Chicago, IL",10,135,,3.0,2012-08-23,"The food was typical for these types of joints.....at least that's what we expected.  However our experience took a twist and that's why I decided to write a review.  My wife and I ordered the cheese fries appetizer and I got Cajun Chicken Pasta while she got Margarita Grilled Chicken for entrees.  For some reason however, the cook seemed to be spice happy and doused my pasta with seasoned salt.  It was gross; I couldn't taste the chicken or alfredo sauce because the salt was so over-powering.  My wife got a side of corn-on-the-cob and it was the same way, salt city.  We were very hungry and upset that the food came and we couldn't eat it without getting high blood pressure.   We complained and I thought our waitress would be less than happy, because we had been asking tons of questions already.  Hey, it was late, and I'm sure she just wanted us to eat and vamoose.  However, our server (Samantha) couldn't have been nicer.....and it wasn't the college cheerleader 'GO STATE' type of chipper/phony nice.  She was super cool, apologetic and attentive without even the slightest hint of an attitude.  She immediately put in another order (without the salt) and fast tracked it.  In a few minutes I had a hot plate of delicious Cajun Chicken Pasta (and hopefully the cook didn't spit in it too much:).  It was delicious.  Good job Samantha, good job Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sandusky?start=20,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004

20,Adam D.,"Mentor, OH",0,10,,5.0,2014-10-19,"Went to TGI Fridays last night.  My wife and i spent $80 and left unsatisfied and hungry.  The food was average at best and the portions were very small and expensive. Today, we visited Chilis.  Our bill came out to be about $40.  I was very happy with the food freshness, portions, and price.   Onion rings were very crispy and flavorful.  Vegetables (I enjoy always ordering veggies) we're fresh and delicious.  We had boneless buffalo wings and they were fresh and flavorful.  The service was very good! My only complaint was the Chipotle honey chicken fingers were too sweet but I just don't like sweet things. Highly recommend this Chilis!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sandusky?start=20,,,,,
25,Stanley M.,"Sandusky, OH",0,4,,2.0,2015-02-16,Very unsatisfied with the service and food. 3 tables and took over 30 mins to get our food. Never had a bad experience until today. The waitress we had seemed like it was such a burden to take our order and then brought out our food with stuff we asked without. She brought out tortilla shells and stuff for the fajitas 20 mins before they were done so we had to ask her for new stuff. She apologized for messing up. Good thing the food was good or I wouldn't ever consider coming back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sandusky?start=20,,,,,

18,Cristi E.,"Battle Creek, MI",157,36,18.0,2.0,2015-07-01,One of four meals wrong. Forever on remake. Remake worse than the original. Drinks empty most of visit. Not worth the $.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sandusky,,,,,
14,Jason G.,"Stow, OH",0,11,3.0,1.0,2015-07-04,"The hostess greeted us so awkwardly that I asked her if she wanted us to leave. She said ""that's your choice"". It was clear that the staff wants to go home. They are all making horrible faces at each new customer as they arrived. It's only 10:00.  On a bright note, the new smoked wings are awesome!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sandusky,,,,,

17,Christy M.,"Sandusky, OH",11,3,,2.0,2015-11-23,The food at this Chili's is subpar at best.   The service is decent.   This is a restaurant that we avoid between November and April because you have to eat with your coat on.   Why is it so cold in here???,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sandusky,,,,,
15,Super D.,"Amarillo, TX",61,14,2.0,1.0,2016-01-31,"Went here on January 27th while visiting Kalahari. There was probably 5 tables in the whole place. Service was slow and food took forever! Ordered the quest app. The dip was room temperature and the chips had salt poured all over them. Our food probably took another 30 minutes to come to the table. I ordered ""sizzled fajitas"" THEY WERE COLD!! My guacamole was brown! My husband ordered the quesadillas and was very disappointed. We ordered another round from the computer pad at our table. I guess you have to flag your server down to tell her you ordered another one. We left hungry and not very happy. I'm sure Golden Corral is better than this place!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sandusky,,,,,
10,Syeda M.,"Allen Park, MI",9,39,20.0,3.0,2016-05-04,"The food was like all other usual Chilis. Nothing extraordinary. But the server was very nice by bringing up extra seasoning for my salmon and refilling out glasses and drinks. Only negative is, the food came out reallllly late and I can't blame it on the server. Don't know what is happening behind the closed kitchen doors.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sandusky,,,,,

16,Jamie F.,"Columbus, OH",30,5,13.0,5.0,2016-07-10,We had dinner this evening at this location. Visiting Sandusky and Cedar Point. Initially our visit was a little disappointing as 10 minutes went by and no one acknowledged us or took a drink order. I went up to the host/hostess stand and requested someone come over. Francisco arrived and saved the day. He is a Rock Star server. Absolutely wonderful. He was great with our kids. Actually our son decided not to order anything but a drink. We placed our order and then a few minutes later Francisco came out to verify he had gotten our order correct because he realized only 3 people in our party ordered and was concerned he missed an order. That was awesome and kind. Kudos to Francisco. We had a really nice dinner thanks to him. Oh and the food was spot on!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sandusky,,,,,
6,Jen B.,"Monterey, TN",21,191,159.0,4.0,2016-10-08,Came on a Wed evening around 8pm. We were seated behind a large party but they were on their way out. Unfortunately for us they were out of their IPA on tap. We ordered the white queso and it was pretty good. For dinner we had the Santa Fe chicken salad. One of our favs and split a guacamole burger. The salad of course was delicious. The burger came out perfectly cooked and juicy. Over all a good experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sandusky,,,,,
4,Andrew M.,"Dayton, OH",9,25,9.0,4.0,2016-10-16,"Sunday night.  Needed to pepper in some fun.  I realize a lot of Yelpers don't think highly of the classy sir-down chains, myself included but Chili's is my exception.  Hell, even Ted Danson slums it up at a longhorn every now and then.  Anyway,  I got the bottomless tostadas and salsa, some ""loaded"" queso, and a smothered burrito.  Just something light for an autumn Sunday eve.  Food was as expected.  Good not great.  But that's what is so great about this place--rarely wows, but never lets me down.  In the words of Kanye, ""Man why can't life always be this easy"".  Full disclosure I have adored chili's for years so it may be nostalgia speaking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sandusky,,,,,
9,Timothy S.,"Madison, WI",15,446,,4.0,2016-10-21,"Quick service and a pleasant waitress was greatly appreciated.   Our food was good, especially the Chicken Crispers and the Onion Rings, which were perfect.   But the Southwest Eggrolls are just not the same as they used to be to my memory.   I think it is the chipotle sauce or maybe the egg rolls were not southwestern in the past.   I had to use the sauces to make them taste better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sandusky,,,,,
11,Amie T.,"Fremont, OH",3,10,3.0,1.0,2017-03-09,"We went to dinner for our 5 yr wedding anniversary last night... first they were out of the fried cheese bites we went for, ok... so we decided on sharing the mini burgers, southwest rolls and the new three meat combo with sausage,ribs, chicken breast with fries and corn on the cob as sides. We get everything, was good until we tried the corn, it was very cold..not the end of the world, then we try the chicken. It was very cold all the way through. That was not ok so we had to complain. Manager offered new chicken & corn, we accepted and he said he'd wipe the whole combo off our bill and they brought us a new bill. We were ok with that. Then the waitress comes and asked us to pay before we left only to find out they had since added the chicken & corn back on separately and our bill was now higher again! Would have been ok if they would have told us that and not forgave the meal,then gave us a bill, only to change their minds later! Not happy with our experience and will NOT be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sandusky,,,,,

5,Andi D.,"Grove City, OH",2,36,45.0,3.0,2017-06-12,"I have always liked Chili's and have always been pleased with the service and the food we have received at whatever Chili's location we have patronized. But like many restaurants that are sit down but not upscale, I continually run into some of the same issues. The hostess was extremely pleasant and our waitress was very nice. We went for lunch and it was not crowded at all. Maybe 5 tables in the entire place had customers. I was a bit disappointed that, like several of these kinds of restaurants, did not carry regular sweet tea. They had black raspberry, or regular raspberry which they were out of, but no standard sweet tea. I don't like sweetening unsweetened tea because the sugar is too grainy and doesn't dissolve and I don't like the artificial sweeteners. It also took about 25 minutes to get our food. I ordered a chicken enchilada with a salad and cup of soup. My son ordered a burger and fries with a side of chili, and both of my parents had a lunch special as well. The food was excellent, however the timing of bringing everything out at once was poor. When offering different courses with the meal, the soup and salad should have came out first, then the main course. I know that this is not fancy, but it is very awkward and cumbersome with each person getting 2 or 3 plates each all at one time and trying to fit them all on table. Other than that no complaints. The place was very clean and the atmosphere was incredibly comfortable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sandusky,3.28,3.28,3.28,,3.2800000000000002
2,Rodrigo T.,"Lincoln Park, MI",323,792,2219.0,4.0,2017-06-23,"After a whole day of walking around at that big giant theme park in a island nearby. Screaming your lungs off can definitely get a whole group famished. It's also only proper to fill up the belly for our 3hr ride back to Detroit of course.  Presidente Margarita: a little on the sour side. Wasn't very strong either. Chips and Guac: Very Yummy Prime Rib Bowl: flavors were amazing. A bit meager. I felt as if i didn't munch of the chips and Guac I would be left hungry still.I'm  Prime Rib Tacos: This one was really good. Although I felt like it's basically the bowl just in taco form. The service was very pleasant. We had a great time drinking, eating and shooting the breeze. We definitely had a great dining experience here. Thank you for reading my review. I hope this helps.

Wanted to dine at the waterfront  cafe only to find out they close at dusk?? For a popular water parks resort like Sandusky,Ohio  and a prime location for food and drinks on the water that closes at DUSK in the Summer?! I must say this Chili's was very accommodating and stayed open a half hour past closing time to accommodate us and others says a lot.

7,Mark B.,"Lima, OH",0,6,,2.0,2017-09-01,"Came in from out of town.  Arrived around 730pm.  No wait, in fact seemed deserted for a Friday Night. Server brings drinks and ask for straw which wasn't included.  Waited nearly 10minutes for a straw.  My adult beverage took even longer to arrive, for simple margarita. The Blanco Queso was nothing more than stringy provolone and Blanco mixed, with teaspoon of ground beef, teaspoon of tomato and teaspoon of guac.  Firmed up in minutes.  Potato soup was bland and actually tasted like Velveeta cheese added to can soup.  Very salty to taste.  Shrimp fajitas was small  mini salad shrimp.  Really for nearly 17.00 The boat with sour cream, cheese, guac. Was no more than a tablespoon full of each.  Waitress took my daughters drink glass never returned with refill.  Had to ask again to bring a refill for her.   Waitress seemed disconnected with the customer.  It was not that she was busy because alot of open areas.  Wife had the crispy chicken.  Soggy and salty.  The corn was glazed in garlic which was overpowering.  Daughter's chicken sandwich slipped through soggy bun after 2 bites.  Couldn't finish. Fries were season salted and again over salt.  Does any of the kitchen staff actually taste what is coming out if the kitchen.  Wasn't offered carryout box, wife never did receive a refill on soda.  For spending nearly 100.00 I would have had better experience at another establishment.  I have ate at other chili establishments with great service, great connection and great food.  I don't know if it's the summer wind down but a need to review quality. I don't know if a manager was working but maybe making rounds and getting feedback would help.  Just our observations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sandusky,3.24,3.24,3.24,,3.2400000000000007

Now let's talk about how cold it was in the Restaurant.  My family ate with our coats and hats on...  The bathrooms were also not clean.  Avoid ever eating here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sandusky,3.08,3.08,3.08,,3.0800000000000005
