26,Jean W.,"Riverton, UT",225,365,428.0,3.0,2012-01-24,"Someday when I'm rich and famous, I'm going to buy myself a Chili's or two. I probably won't eat there, but I'd honestly own a couple of Utah locations, especially this one. Why, you ask? 1. There are consistently hoards of people willing to wait 30-90 minutes in a teeny-tiny non-temperature-controlled vestibule to get a table here. 2. The profit margins on their menu items are certainly in the neighborhood of 7,200%. 3. They hire college-age (and under) servers, bussers, and kitchen staff. This undoubtedly translates to sub-standard pay/benefits. Cha-ching! 4. They have full-bar privileges for adult beverages. All imbibers are required by law to place an accompanying food order. Cha-ling-a-ching! 5. Their food is proven to be addictive. (See any health & wellness study ever done.) 6. The fare is cunningly priced to come in just under ""we can't afford this"" and just above ""wow, this is cheap."" This translates to gen-pub affordability. I'm sure there are many other reasons, but the bottom line is: they serve medium to large-ish portions of quite unexceptional food, and deliver it to your table via moderately-trained servers. They don't hire chefs, as is common with chain restos. There is no artistry to their offerings, nor love coming from their kitchens; merely a guy named Karl with a food handler's permit who can use a microwave, is capable of pouring from a Ziploc bag, and can open a can or two without requiring a Worker's Comp claim. All that said, this stuff doesn't taste that bad, for the most part. The queso dip is adequate; the salads are mid-grade; the fajitas are okay. And so on, and so on... They make some decent margaritas, which they're evidently ""famous for."" I've had my share of El Presidente, and after the first one they're pretty tasty. There will always be plenty-o-parties with meandering toddlers and screaming babies. You can ask to be moved, but there really are no safe zones, except the bar. Scratch that - many of these ankle-biteristic parties afford their young RRR privileges (Random Restaurant Roaming), so there's still a great chance you'll enjoy a temporary visit from the kiddies even in the bar area. I haven't had anything at Chili's I've needed to send back. Nor have I had anything that caused me to take an eyes-closed moment to ponder on the flavors and contemplate the ingredients out of desire to recreate it at home. No thought required at all, in fact. For my chain money, it's better than TGI Friday's or Applebee's, which by all rights are Chili's bastard stepbrothers. Our recent visit was highlighted by a supremely attentive server who didn't miss a single beat, and was so well-mannered and professional that I suggested he set his sights higher and apply at a real restaurant. In retrospect, I sincerely hope he saw it as the compliment it was meant to be.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sandy?start=40,2.1879999999999997,2.1879999999999997,2.1879999999999997,2.1879999999999997,2.1879999999999997

The service is fine, and the restaurant is clean enough, but the food has been really disappointing the past few times we've been here. Smaller portions, not as fresh, lower quality, and doesn't come out hot. I tried the bacon-jack-chicken thing last time and, well, the photo on the menu sure made it look good... Weird seasonings all around, stale-tasting broccoli and pretty good chicken on a cold, smudged/dirty plate.

They gave us a bowl of lemons for our waters, we won't be getting scurvy anytime soon (but seriously it's nice when they're not stingy with the lemon). I got the Santa Fe Chicken Salad for about $10, I noticed that some of the lettuce leafs were brown and the sauce masked the freshness of the salad. (The salads are served on rectangle plates, it would be nice if they had the traditional round plate for a salad - next time I'll ask for it).  I'm a sports fan, so it was nice to have a basketball game and tennis match (that's right, two TVs) to glance at every once in a while.

We were warned in advance, so I'm not upset about the wait...just mentioning it in case people are worried about timeliness.  Be careful if you go with kids, they have tablets at every table and you don't have to approve anything for your child to start charging games to your bill. They get around it by saying that the tablet mentions it on the very first screen. But if your child happens to tap the screen at all before you read that you never see it again. They also won't take the tablet away from the table because ""that's where it's assigned to be"" so we had to fight with our three year old the entire time to eat her food and not play with the tablet. No matter where we moved it she was trying to get it. We don't let her play with technology at the table so she thought it was a big treat. The chips and salsa are good, but the chips are so thin they break constantly.  I ordered the chicken fajitas, but the pan was so hot (yes I know it's supposed to be hot) that my food was literally burning while I was trying to eat it.

42,David G.,"Sandy, UT",70,183,88.0,4.0,2016-11-01,This place is only getting 4 stars because our waiter was so good. His name is Glade and he has long flowing hair with an attitude that is infectious. The food was a 3 which is pretty standard for chillis but I just had to give a shout out to the excellent service and a smile that I got from glade.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sandy,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28
44,Nikki M.,"Riverton, Salt Lake City, UT",39,96,43.0,5.0,2016-11-04,Ohhhhh chilis. You never let me down. Everything about this restaurant makes me happy. The service is always top notch.

52,Steve J.,"West Jordan, UT",0,57,,3.0,2017-01-09,"We used to go here all the time....chips and salsa can't be beat. Chips and queso bean dip the bomb. So what gives?  Why 3 stars? The service is usually great...  What gives?  Less and less bang for the buck. Even with their specials, they are expensive for the amount of food you get. Portions are getting smaller, prices are going up. You must keep ordering or you are still hungry sort of thing. It will be a death spiral for chilli's eventually.

48,Samantha B.,"West Jordan, UT",66,29,45.0,5.0,2017-01-24,Came with a friend and we sat at the bar.  Our service was great for how late it was. We both ordered the Ancho Salmon. It was cooked to perfection and came out fresh! Usually when you go to places late its never good. Our waiter was always checking up on us and refilling our drinks. Definitely  will be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sandy,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
4,C H.,"Sandy, UT",0,9,,3.0,2017-03-08,"The service at this Chilis has steadily declined over the last year. Used to go at least twice a month. Now go every few months thinking they will have improved. Servers are not very attentive. Lucky to get a refill. Now that you pay at table they dont bother asking if your food is good, do you need a box to go etc...very disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sandy?start=20,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36
3,Krystle S.,"South Jordan, UT",3,6,,1.0,2017-03-31,"Took the family here for dinner they got us in right away. We were just waiting for one more person and I let the host know. The host got utensils for everybody except for the one person. Then, sat us at the smallest table when asked for a larger table the waiter ""now"" told us he didn't have any. We looked around and seen there was only two large tables in the whole restaurant and they were occupied. Both of us adults were sitting halfway out in the aisle way. All the tables were so close to each other you've got no privacy. Okay, whatever, it's fine, we thought as long as the food is good. The only thing that was good was the appetizers everything else was overcooked. They didn't even have pineapple slices for the kids so my kids had to choose something else. The waiter was nice but in a rush which caused him to be forgetful. He forgot my daughters order so she had to wait while everyone else ate, by the time her food was done everyone had finished eating. Then, when my daughter went to the restroom I got a glimpse of the kitchen and it was filthy! Food was absolutely everywhere on the floor! I'm surprised workers didn't slip and fall. This location was disorganized, small(not family friendly), food over cooked, hazardous, and everyone was rushing. Not a good atmosphere. I'm giving one stars for them getting us back on time, our waiter nice attitude with how busy it was, and appetizers. Worst Chilliest I've been too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sandy?start=20,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36

The restaurant was dirty, the waitress was slow. We had to ask 5 times for straws, yes straws. The soup was good but everything else was gross. The guacamole had strings of hard avocado in it and was already Browning. The cheese curds were burnt and the southwest egg rolls were also over cooked. Our waitress was so slow I didn't even  want to talk to a manager waste of 45 bucks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sandy,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32

36,Bradford H.,"Sandy, UT",53,2,25.0,1.0,2017-12-17,"Wow, just paid $40 for probably one of the worst meals I've ever had in my life. First, let's get this out of the way, the service (Rachel I believe?) was fine.  No issues there at all.  I wish I could rate the food and service separate.  The food was so bad, it negated any bump in rating for the service. When we were seated, there was a spilled drink next to our table.  I stepped on ice as I walked to the table.  In the 45ish minutes we were there, it was never cleaned up. The chips and salsa - many of the chips were soaked glistening wet in oil.  There was a group of chips maybe 10 chips thick stuck together in a giant  inedible chunk. Our food arrived within less than 15 minutes of ordering.  So what I'm about to say below could not have been due to the server leaving it at the window too long. My wife had the chicken fajitas.  When it came out, it didn't have the characteristic sizzle of the cast iron plate.  Fine.  What wasn't fine was her onions were borderline raw.  Her beans were stone cold. I had the crispers and waffles.   My food was also barely warm.  My fries obviously had been cooked long ago and were stale and bad.  The breading on the chicken had a burnt taste to it, like it had been cooked in very old oil.  The crispers and waffles even if it had been well cooked I felt just wasn't good at all.  Way too much sugar.  I ate 1 and a half and couldn't continue due to the richness of the dish. My son had the quesadilla.  The fries that came with his meal were in the same shape as mine.  Some of the cheese on the bottom of his quesadilla had seeped out and burned. I won't ever go back.  When you have that many fails in a single meal, it indicates that something is very very wrong at this Sandy location.  With the poor temperature control with the food, at this point I am hoping I didn't pay $40 to get my family sick.  With all these problems in plain sight, I can only imagine what other problems may lurk out of customer view in the kitchen.  We took the leftovers home, but after thinking about the temperatures, I'll be throwing it out. I hate to rip on an establishment this hard.  But it was just absolutely terrible.  Easily in the top 3 or 4 worst meals I have ever paid for in my life.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-sandy,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96
