25,Ava A.,"Savannah, GA",318,230,677.0,1.0,2013-01-11,"I have had better service and cleaner food in third world countries. In a nut shell, my trip had dirty dishes, dirty booths, bad shrimp and pathetic service. I always come back here due the 2 for one beer special all day everyday but over the last year this place has changed. I had a love affair with the Chicken Chili Lime Soup, it was low-fat and full of flavor.   I would crave it and drive down to enjoy the tasty stuff.  It is off the menu now.   So we came in on a Saturday night after a meeting.  We ordered some shrimp tacos and the shrimp was bad.  Real bad.  Had to spit it out bad.  The waiter never came back on the Saturday night I was there to check so I just left money on the stupid table.  Stunned by the awful food and service as I go to this establishment frequently and it is usually pretty good. A week later I return for a Saturday lunch. The place wasn't that busy.  We were shown to our booth.  It was dirty.  Food stuck to it dirty.  The seat also needed to be wiped off, when I turned around to alert the wait staff she had already disappeared.  I waited standing up and still had to flag someone down to get the goo off the seat.  Once I explained why I was standing I was passed a wet cloth so I could wipe it off myself.  WOW!  No apology for the dirty booth seat or table.    I ordered soup, and a water to start off our meal.   Water glass had a floater in it.  Soup was running everywhere and the spoon was caked with food.   Bowl had a chip broken out of it.  I also ordered a salad, which consisted of bagged white iceberg lettuce, and white crusty carrots.  Wait staff never checked back after we got our food.  My date wanted mustard and ketchup but never got a chance to ask for them by any server.  We flagged another server down and she looked at us and walked away.   Our waitress just slammed the check down on the tabletop while talking to her friend, some 20 minutes later.  No water refills offered, to go boxes were not offered, questions were not asked as to why we had not eaten our food.  There was complete apathy for the patrons experience at this establishment.   I don't know if I can trust this Chili's for dining in the future. Although, 2 for 1 on beers is a hard deal to beat.  Please fix the service.  Thanks",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-savannah?start=20,2.148,2.148,2.148,2.148,2.148

As soon as we sat down we were promptly approached by the waitress and advised on what was the best that day. I ordered potato soup with guacamole burger and my wife got quesadilla salad. The food was good though I would prefer to have it little warmer. Also my burger felt somewhat unbalanced, each different bite felt differently than the previous one. Not for much but you could feel that. We also ordered cheesecake and chocolate molten cake they were really delicious and well made. The place was clean and modern-looking and although it was pretty full it was loud at all. The waitress was very nice and made us felt welcome there. Overall I think this place doesn't disappoint.

Now I work in the service industry so I understand not being in a great mood at work but you need to try and fake it at least. Anyway, the only reason I was really upset that she took so long to find out if we wanted to order did was because I knew that my grieved had worked through lunch in the heat so I was really more worried about him. I've been to this location before and whether it's the dining room or the bar I've had similar service issues.

The 2 for $22 special is seriously the bomb.  You get one appetizer to share and TWO entrees for $22.  Amazing.  We love their endless chips and salsa.  I don't know- something about those thinly fried chips is really good.  This past weekend, we both ordered the 6oz steak for our entrees, which comes with 2 sides.  I got the loaded mashed potatoes and broccoli, as that's what it is usually paired with (although you can substitute any side for no additional cost).  So.  Much.  Food. !!!  The steak was cooked just as I preferred, and the loaded mashed potatoes were so indulgently good.  The broccoli was the only letdown- it lacked any kind of flavor, but the rest of the meal made up for it.  Overall, it was a really yummy meal! We've also done the 2 for $35, which comes with 2 margaritas and a dessert to share.  I don't come here often, but I've never had a bad experience here.  Although it is a chain restaurant, the deals offered make it worth it every now and then!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-savannah,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6

My boyfriend got endless soup and salad and only got to order twice. It was t worth the money we spent and I'll doubt we'll come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-savannah,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
6,Kirk S.,"Atlanta, GA",93,2,,2.0,2017-11-04,"The service was very slow - the server disappeared for long stretches of time and seemed unable to manage more than one task at a time. The fried cheese balls were over-cooked and over-salted. The chips for the nachos were stale. The ""side"" of guacamole was an extra $1, but was laughably small. And the guacamole was ""homemade"" only if cutting the corner off a plastic bag and scooping its contents into a bowl counts as making something at home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-savannah,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56

My drink has been empty for quite some time and no one has come to help me. I just want to leave now, but they won't bring me my check. I suspect my waitress is gone. I call out, but she's no where to be seen. I hope this will all be over soon... If you're reading this, tell my family I love them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-savannah,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
