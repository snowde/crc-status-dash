Noisy kids. Whey my friends and I were finally directed toward a table, it was filthy. Even after it was wiped off, it still felt sticky. Meanwhile, the floor under our table was filthy.

I sat at the bar and the bartender, Briana, was very customer-friendly. She refilled my waters extremely fast, got my order right on the first time, and was very friendly. The food was good. I ordered a 6oz steak and Margherita chicken breast, and they were both done perfectly. The sides of broccoli and mashed potatoes were just fine. If you're staying at one of the nearby hotels or are just looking for Chili's fare, this place is pretty solid.  No cons that I can think of, but if a store manager is reading this, it would be great if they expanded the selection of beers on draft, as it appeared they only had 4 or 5 :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-seaside?start=100,2.8,2.8,2.8,2.448,2.8

111,Cathy K.,"Seaside, CA",94,162,98.0,3.0,2012-04-14,"Ok - so I hate to admit it, but I LOVE Chili's, albeit not as much as some folks.  After spending a couple years in Washington, where there is one Chili's in Spokane and one at the airport, you start to crave a little mass-produced grease.   Beat up chain restaurants all you want, but one thing they strive to be, is consistent.  You always know what you are getting and how it should taste.  This location is no different and I like the ability to order the margarita chicken with black beans and rice.  This is a light option that I often appreciate and doesn't suck.  I chased my chicken with a glass of house chardonnay.  Again, not a huge fan of Barefoot, we let's face it - when you can't splurge on Opus One and Foie Gras for dinner all the time, this will do.  In the words of the farmer...""that'll do pig....that'll do.""   The service was good, as well.  Again, no complaints here at all.  Our server was on her game and had the water always full and the check in and out quick.  She got a great tip and she was still busy.  She managed to treat us better than many restaurants we have been to at much higher price points. Our food was warm and she didn't roll her eyes when I had a million little requests such as no cheese, dressing on the side, etc. etc.  Thank you for that!  While I am not ""Sally,"" I know all those details are sometimes challenging for some servers to keep up with.   For those of you with kiddos, they often run specials where kids eat free.  For those of us trying to stick to a budget, that can be a huge win! Good job, Chili's.  I am giving you a three because you are just fine the way you are and I save my 4 and 5 stars for non-mass produced food.  Don't let it get you down though, because we will definitely be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-seaside?start=120,2.72,2.72,2.72,2.316,2.72

Since I heard the service wasn't as good anymore, I avoided the trouble altogether and took my food to go. No regrets at all!  Even though I had to wait a grilling 20 mins for my food, it beat waiting in line 45 mins to be seated in the noisy, (predominately kid) crowded restaurant. My food was WONDERFUL. I intended to get some pictures for you yelpers, but after the first bite, I was unstoppable! I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Ranch Sandwich and was delighted to find that no only was the chicken juicy, but it was bigger than the bun itself!! Just writing about it is making my mouth water =P  People, if you suspect (any) restaurant may be filthy or lines may be long, take your food to go! It's not a sin! I strive to enjoy my food as much as possible, and won't hesitate to eat my meal elsewhere if I have to.

We split a half order of Texas Cheese Fries which was melted cheese, bacon and green onions with ranch dipping sauce. The fries were alright. The cheese had hardened by the time the fries made it to our table so I didn't get the cheesy texture I was looking for.  I ordered the Cajun Chicken Pasta with an Alfredo sauce. This has to be by far the worst pasta I have ever had. It tasted like it came out of a Kraft box. As an Italian, I am ashamed of eating such a catastrophe of a dish. My roommate on the other hand enjoyed his meal just a bit more than I did. He got their half rack of baby back ribs with home fries.  Final Thoughts: Bar far the worst chain restaurant I have been to to date. The service was superb however! Our server was very attentive.

75,Kayla M.,"Monterey, CA",30,40,4.0,3.0,2012-08-05,"I mean, I guess I like Chili's, but I have been eating at Chili's since the time I ordered from the kid's menu. As the food is now good, not exceptionally great, it really is not the same as it used to be. It is decent for the convenience and price though. The food used to be really, really great. Not five star, but not one step above fast food, (which is what it has become now) either. I have been visiting this restaurant for well over a decade, and I have seen about five major menu changes/overhauls.. each time the prices rise, the menu items change, or are adjusted, and the quality of the food is affected poorly. There is no avoiding it. I used to visit for the hamburgers. They came with an amazingly fresh tasting, juicy patty which came packed with all sorts of flavor. Then topped with juicy, meaty bacon, real cheddar, quality bread, fresh, crisp produce etc. All coming together for that certain ""great burger"" flavors giving us that taste our mouth's water for. Their burger nearly had it all, and they have slowly let it slip away.... Now they remind me of a $6.00 burger from Carl's Jr. Well, if you join their email club you get a free queso dip for doing so and receive coupons and notifications for the kids eat free days and what not. I enjoy redeeming the free appetizer or dessert coupons.  The egg rolls are amazing. The QUESO dip is grrrreeat! The chicken enchilada tortilla soups is super good too. Sliders are pretty good. Burgers ok a little dry, inconsistent, some days better than others The Philly cheesesteak is actually not bad if you order no cheese sauce and get regular cheese. It is too greasy the way they serve - even thought thats the classic preparation. Decent fries. Pretty good buffalo chicken ranch sandwich.  Decent bar. Good for a quick/casual meal or drink with out any serious expectations.

I don't actually take the time to review on a regular basis however this place was so bad that I thought it deserved special attentions (which is not what we received at this armpit of a restaurant). Please do not go here and save yourself from horrible service, cold food, and generally just bad management. Upon being seated we waited no less than 15 minutes for our waitress to grace us with her presence. Once she finally came over I had to take a look around and make sure that we weren't on some reality show because there is no way that a waitress this bad with this amount of attitude should still be employed. We ordered appetizers that came out cold AND with the rest of the meal. We ordered the chicken fajitas and they were just blah. Our kids had mac and cheese, also cold (more than likely because our horrible waitress was running around accomplishing nothing). I have absolutely nothing positive to say about this place.

The server never told us her name, rarely checked on us and didn't even seem to care about us visiting this establishment.  After taking just our appetizer and drink order the waitress disappeared for 10 minutes and didn't show up for another 10 minutes, I highly doubt this is company policy. We saw her walk by several times not once asking how things were. While I was walking my 10 month old around the dining area, there was straws, broccoli on the floor. Many tables, at least 5-6 were not bussed. I noticed garbage all over the kitchen floor.  The french fries were over fried and unedible, the steak was very chewie ( when ordered medium rare).

151,Ashley D.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,16,1.0,1.0,2013-06-20,"Our experience here was horrific. We came in for an early lunch at 11 to beat the crowds, we were greeted and seated in a timely manner. Our waitress brought us our drinks and took our order...and from there it went straight to hell. While waiting for our food a huge group of 30+ people came in, they chose to sit this group all around us in different booths. I soon couldn't even hear myself talk because of the yelling this party of people was doing back and forth to each other. They were hanging over the booths, running from table to table, kicking the back of the booth seats...you would have thought these people were wild animals. They sat all 8 of the children which had to be 12 and under together in the table directly behind us with no parent. Come on, really? Where are these peoples manners? We waited for our waitress to come back to our table for a good 20min, hoping she would move us and by now I'm sure everyone can tell we are very annoyed. Another 10min go by...no waitress. My husband finally gets up to go look for her. Keep in mind we have been waiting for our food for close to an hour now. He finally finds her and she sends her manager over. We explain our unhappiness and ask for our food to go. She apologizes and says she will give us one meal free. We don't even wait at the table for our food. We get up and wait by the entrance and before they can even clean off our table the group of ""animals"" rushes in and starts eating off our Chips and Salsa plate. I'm shocked, and disgusted. They finally bring our food out to us and we go to the local 20th street park to eat , only to realize they haven't given us utensils with our ""to-go"" order or even napkins for that matter. By the time my husband drives back and returns with our utensils our food is not even warm anymore. My husband had ordered the fajitas and when he opens his box, they had forgot the tortillas. So he returns for a 3rd time. The manager apologizes over and over. By now we just want our money back. But the manager decides it fair to give us $30 in ""Chili's Cash"" instead, when our party of 5 clearly payed over $70 with lunch and drinks...really? Like I'm ever coming back here again! Please, don't waste your time. I'm disgusted and horrified at the service these people have.

It's never going to be a gourmet restaurant or have foie gras so we all know it's got what American's love. Burgers, Nachos, Salads, and the like. That being said, this place isn't all that bad. It has relatively quick seating, and the staff I have found to be rather friendly.  As for the To Go options, I had my first experience ordering online, and paying before hand online as well. Unfortunately, when I arrived they were out of the sweet potato fries I had ordered and asked if I wanted regular fries. I was fine with that, but I assumed they would change my bill and refund me the extra money that it cost me for sweet potato fries. Unfortunately I was wrong. I wasn't asked about it and when I did, wasn't offered the money back. I wasn't overly upset because it was a a buck or two more, but still, money is money.  Bottom line, if you go here, go for a sit down meal. The online to go option is a little lackluster.

90,albert r.,"Quantico, VA",0,3,,1.0,2013-08-22,"My worst Chili's experience, ever. Bad service from the hostess and server. Cold and bland tasting food. Over and under cooked steak. Save your time and money, stay away from this place. I recommend going to LaLa Grill.  The story.  I don't typically write Yelp reviews, but I feel especially compelled to write this one. Came for dinner with my family on Friday, Aug.16, at approximately 9:30pm. Had not been to this Chili's restaurant in Seaside in over 2yrs. I have had great dining experiences at other Chili's locations I've been to so far; usually ordering the classic sirloin steak. We walk in and are met by the hostess. We inquire about their Happy Hour, asking, ""what time does your happy hour end?"" The hostess did not know this basic information and tells us so. So we ask her, ""is there maybe someone you could ask?"" She asks a nearby coworker who also does not know. The hostess turns back to us with a blank look on her face and again tells us that she does not know. She then stares at us for several seconds rather than find the answer to our simple question. I say in my head, ""well, go find the answer!"" My sister takes initiative and walks over to a table, picks up a menu and locates the information in less than 15sec.  We were seated with no wait time. I looked around, and noticed the place seemed unusually slow for a restraunt on a Friday night.  I ordered the classic sirloin steak, cooked to medium (pink in the middle), w/ mashed potatoes, steamed broccoli and Texas toast. My wife ordered the same meal as I, except she ordered her steak cooked medium-rare w/ no Texas toast. We waited 17min. for our food. It did not arrive hot and my food was pretty bland. My steak was cooked practically to well done as there was was very-very little pink left. It looked like shoe leather. My wife's steak was cooked to medium and there was toast on her plate.  I showed my steak to the waitress and she returned it to the kitchen. While I waited, I went onto Yelp to check the reviews for this place and it only had 2.5 stars out of 69 reviews, highlighting horrible service and cold food. 7min later she brings my plate back. My steak was cooked to med-rare this time.  Not wanting to send my food back a third time in fear of them tampering with it, I cut my losses and started to eat. Everything on my plate was Luke warm. The steak was undercooked and unflavorful. The mashed potatoes were decent but cold. The broccoli  and Texas toast was also bland and cold. I will not patron or recommend this restaurant (Chili's in Seaside, Ca) to anyone in the future.  Recommendations for this restaurant to improve their customers experience: Train all employees on general knowledge of the menu. Train servers and especially hosts on politeness and professional courtesy. Train kitchen staff on proper cooking time/temperatures for meats. Employ more experienced chefs to run the kitchen.  Employ a supervisor to oversee, instruct and improve employees' work performances.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-seaside?start=100,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.148,2.48

Our waiter is the only reason why I am giving this location three stars, she was very accommodating to all of our requests. I ordered the parmesan encrusted tilapia  which came with a side of broccoli and their rice (which was not Mexican, I thought that was odd) and the chicken was placed on top of the rice, ultimately causing the rice to be drenched in oil and fat that probably came from the deep fryer the chicken was cooked in. THE BROCCOLI WAS PERFECT. I am very picky with how my broccoli is cooked and the green vegetable was just perfect. The tilapia for one smelled fishy and I after I got through half of the large fillet I literally choke on all of the spices, which for the first half of the fillet seemed non existant, and our lovely waiter comes over and asks if I was okay and I would like my dish traded out because she could smell the overload of spice from three feet away.

I didn't even peak at the menu and just went with the thing I loved to eat at the Salinas location, Monterey Chicken. The chicken was cooked pretty well, but the sauce tasted weird and sour. I guess different locations make their own interpretations of a dish? The gravy that we had tasted off too. It just wasn't a good experience at all. Oh, and not to mention the silverware!!

Bear in mind, all over the restaurant they now have signs that say ""Fresh"" and the like.  Got the onion rings, a burger with bacon and such, and the healthy choice 6 oz. beef tenderloin.  I only expect food offered by Chili's to be grade D or whatever is the edible rating now as labeled by the FDA. However, their onion rings have to be fully frozen because each onion ring had an onion ""skin"" inside but no real onion. You know, like when you peel an onion and there's that sort of skin that has a bit of a membrane. That's how thick the onion was in every single onion ring and the whole onion ring is actually huge.  The beef in the burger did not taste like a burger. However, the bacon and whatever else was on the burger did taste good.  The broccoli with the tenderloin was good and seemed to just be steamed without butter or oil. I liked that a lot. A big plus while traveling and eating a lot of road food. The small tenderloin was really salty -- must use the salt as the tenderizer because it was extremely tender.

I've had a few bad experiences with a Chili's at another location and was a little leery of trying it again. Apparently, like Applebee's, they have really revamped their menu and that's a good thing! We opted to sit in the bar since it looked relatively quiet - no kids - and mostly empty. There were lots of TV's turned to various sports venues and our waitress greeted us very quickly, took our drink orders (iced tea) and left us to peruse the extensive menu. There were the usual suspects: appetizers, salads, chili (of course), burgers, wraps, sandwiches, ribs...you get the picture.  Being sometimes fans of Chipotle's rice bowls, the Chili's version caught our attention. I decided on the Margarita Fresh Mex bowl: house-made corn & black bean salsa, citrus-chile rice, topped with house-made pico de gallo, fresh greens, chopped cilantro, crispy tortilla strips, fresh sliced avocado & a perfect drizzle of margarita sauce. I added chicken to mine and didn't get any tortilla strips but they weren't missed. Not bad at all! My husband ordered the hotter Chipotle Fresh Mex bowl: house-made corn & black bean salsa, citrus-chile rice & chipotle pesto. His was topped with cheddar cheese, house-made pico de gallo, fresh greens, chopped cilantro, crispy tortilla strips, fresh sliced avocado & a drizzle of cumin-lime sour cream. He also added chicken to his. Both were a little under $10 and just the right amount of food. Our waitress was very nice, friendly, and gave us just the right amount of attention. Also like Applebee's, there is that gadget contraption on the table you can ""play"" with but I mainly ignored it ---- until it was time to pay the bill. Our waitress encouraged us to use the thing, so not wanting to be labeled an old curmudgeon, I swiped my debit card, added the tip (got tricked into taking a survey) and printed out my receipt. It was painless really, but is the future for all restaurants? I hope not. Anyway, Chili's has renewed my respect for the brand.

The other thing I thought was weird was I only got the sandwich and was told my fries would be out separately. The came out five minutes later in a doggy bag. Uh, okay. Never got an apology, just took it back and brought me another one. Even worse, this one was cold. The bread wasn't toasted and the chicken was freezing.

Got to the stoplight, coke was flat! Opened to peek at the salad, chicken was cold. Got to work, salad was mostly a shallow bed of brown wilted iceberg.  Never seen so much rotten lettuce in a served salad! Absolutely NO avocado as advertised in the picture. Reluctantly ate a chicken strip, cold and rubbery. Got into my second chicken strip, stared down and spotted a fly! If I get ill shortly I will be calling to complain officially. According to the other comments on Yelp, management doesn't much care.

I love their promotions, from their frequent email discounts to their 2 for $20 back in the day.  Appetizers: I have tried almost every appetizer on the menu and they are all spectacular, except for I wish there were some bread/fried-free options. Their guacamole is almost as good as Chipotle's, and the southwestern egg rolls and Texas cheese fries are unhealthy and outstanding.  Food: Their honey chicken crispers are full of flavor and crunch, their house side salad is superior to most side salads that I have tried, their molten chocolate lava cake is worth melting for, their mango chicken manages to be tender and juicy (and a little too small), and the chicken tortilla soup I just can't get enough of (also incredibly salty, so can't get enough water either). The only thing I have ever tried there that I don't absolutely love is their ribs - could be juicier and more tender. Drinks: Chili's drinks are affordably priced and far more delicious than most places I have been to. If you don't like your drinks to be that strong, I think their margaritas and coolers are refreshing and fun.

The wait time for a slow night was 10 minutes and as soon as we got seated we decided to order, thinking that we might be here for a while. Our server promptly apologized for the wait and said he would take care of us. After receiving our  appetizer we waited 20 minutes for 2 identical orders of ribeye steak. During the wait another server who was acquaintances with my lady, sat down in our booth and overstayed her welcome. The steaks were served and she kept sitting st our table! How unprofessional can you be? Both steaks were ordered the same but we're cooked completely different. We waited for our server to come back to inquire about it and he was no where to be found for 15 minutes. We decided to try eating them to see if we were just tripping, and we weren't.
