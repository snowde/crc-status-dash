So my husband and I were trying to grab a meal before our flight home, we saw Chil's Too and thought it was a good idea. WRONG!!!. First off, there were this family ahead of us and wanted a table, but the hostess (which he was also a server) kept trying to tell the family to sit at the bar table that faces the terminal seating. So the family said, no..we'll wait for a table. Then the hostess goes..'ugh fine"". Then it was our turn and we got seated to a table fairly quickly, but of course, without menus. So a waiter walks by with menus from another table that he just took orders from..I stopped him and nicely asked if we can have some menus. He puts them on the table and walks away. He walks by me again and I politely ask ""excuse me, can we order?"" and he rudely puts up his index finger at me and said..""I'm not ready for you!"" Even the customer sitting at another table gave a look at what happened. Mind you, it was not busy...we saw other waiters just literally standing around and picking their nails.  So instead of sitting through the rudeness and risking the chance of them spitting in our food..we lugged our luggage and ate somewhere else where they were nice and understands that people have a flight to catch.

The service was also abysmal.  Max there were 5 other people there, and we sat for about 10 minutes after we were completely done with our food before I was able to flag down the waitress to bring us our check.  Maybe outside of an airport this works, but we have flights to catch!  Gotta be on top of these things.

5,Nick B.,"Palmdale, CA",0,9,1.0,1.0,2016-06-24,"Terrible. Chili's should be ashamed of the level of service provided to their customers.  I've sat at the bar for 15 minutes, not a single person at this bar has a drink in front of them, and the bartender is fumbling around lost.  I haven't seen anyone even order a beverage yet. Perhaps it's a staff training issue, a manning issue, or a competency issue but customers should not be asked to bear the brunt of any of those problems. I can't wait until the food shows up.  From what I can see of the kitchen, I'm keeping my expectations low.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-seatac,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04

When I ordered a sandwich they told me the kitchen was closer. Worst customer service ever with callous servers who spend more time hanging around than working. Wouldn't recommend that anyone waste their time going here. 50 minute waste of time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-seatac?start=20,1.96,1.96,1.96,,1.96

Absolutely horrible experience thanks in large part to Danielle the ""shift manager"" who has no business card or direct contact number. I left with a piece of receipt paper with her name and date written on it when I asked for a way to complain. She was incredibly rude and the whole experience was ridiculous.

7,Taylor S.,"Seattle, WA",132,16,,1.0,2016-08-02,This use to be such an avg Chilis and a nice treat to get an El Presidente marg before my American flights.  This last time the service was a disaster. No acknowledgement for 10 minutes...i actually just waited and didnt say anything to see how long it would go...or how many servers would pass me by.  Two others sat near me in the bar area and the mgr helped and got their drink orders but not mine...he just got me a menu and said someone would be with me soon.  They did not and I bounced. No Presidente for me today...or anytime in the foreseeable future. Boybye.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-seatac,1.84,1.84,1.84,,1.8400000000000003
15,Lindsey V.,"Miami, FL",6,15,5.0,1.0,2016-08-03,They get 1 star for getting my food out to me quickly. Chilis is my favorite restaurant and I've eaten the original chicken crispers a million times. Their chicken crispers are just chicken fingers. They tasted like something you would find at a ball park or the freezer section at the grocery store. Wasn't expecting something like that or I wouldn't have ordered it. Not the same at all. The broccoli it came with was steamed probably for 30 seconds. Very hard and unseasoned. Not impressed. It's sad to think some people might eat chilis here for the first time and end up hating it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-seatac,1.8,1.8,1.8,,1.8000000000000003
25,Gene A.,"Hesperia, CA",0,41,9.0,4.0,2016-08-07,Pretty good visit here. Waitress was friendly and the hostess was able to get us seated quickly.

20,Justin S.,"Bakersfield, CA",28,41,25.0,1.0,2016-08-12,"This place needs needs new management and employees who know how to multitask.  This by far was the worst Chili's I have ever dined at. They also don't honor the Chili's email offers or Chili's rewards. First off, the greeter seemed way overworked and apparently was also required to buss tables, so she couldn't keep up with the front counter customers as well as handling to-go orders. After being sat at a semi clean table, we waited for about 10 min before anyone came by. The waitress was busy and appeared to only be able to handle only one table at a time. Thinking it would speed up our order, we were gave our complete order so we could make our flight on time. We received our chips and salsa and drinks fairly quick but things turned bad after. Waited another 15 min before our other apps came out, which was only soups and only got 2 of the 3 ordered. Our main course came our about 15 min after that. It was pretty difficult to even get some drink refills. I understand why they have a quick menu but food was taking way to long to come out.  Unless you have a couple hours between flights, and enjoy waiting, I would suggest to skip this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-seatac?start=20,1.8,1.8,1.8,,1.8000000000000003

Instead I got a plate of cold eggs, cold toast and potatoes that felt like they had been left under a warmer for an hour. Not a single piece of food on my plate was above lukewarm.  While I was eating, one member of the staff yelled ""*Insert name here* COME DO YOUR JOB!"" The employee then walked to the front and proceeded to inform the customer ""Sorry, my wait staff is lazy.""  My waiter was great although it was a short stay.  Overall, the food was mediocre and the service was poor.
