37,Marshall O.,"San Antonio, TX",11,17,1.0,1.0,2012-11-18,Went here for lunch yesterday.  Poor service. Waited over 10 minutes before waiter took our drink order. Ordered fajitas. Corn tortillas were cold. The fajitas were unflavorful. Waiter came around only to take our order and drop off the check. A manager refilled our drinks.

39,Morgan G.,"O'Fallon, MO",0,1,,5.0,2013-12-16,"After Traveling for two days nonstop to get to Selma for work, we were excited to have a nice meal and relax. We were sat right away in Erik's section, who was fantastic! Very attentive and informative. He was even helping out at the bar when the bartender was busy. The manager on duty (12/12/13) was very authoritative. She ensured her employees were doing their jobs and her customers were satisfied. It was very apparent her managing was helping this location thrive. She even turned the heat up for us and came back twice to make sure we were warmer. She had a smile on her face the whole time they were there and her employees seemed to have a good relationship with her.

Restaurant was probably 2/3 empty.  The girl took our order then was no where to be found afterwards--not even when we needed a to-go box or to pay the tab.  I had to flag down the guy in a tie (manager?) and even he could care less that our server was no where to be found.  My mentioning of ""our server never came around"" didn't phase him one bit.  Of course, Chili's have the convenient mini machines on each table and so servers don't even have to come back to collect the check.   Got their Meal for 2 ($20): 1 appetizer, 2 entrees Margherita flatbread - pretty good 6 oz sirloin (not bad) with loaded mashed potatoes, sub Southwestern mac and cheese--creamy and pretty good Canjun chicken pasta - sweet and creamy. weird. wasn't a fan I normally like their southwestern egg rolls, mini sliders, and spinach artichoke dip.

24,Judy R.,"San Antonio, TX",61,25,7.0,1.0,2016-04-16,"I try never to give bad reviews, if my experience is bad I give the benefit of the doubt and move on. But this was so negative I had to share. Went there early on a Friday night and , despite ample free seats in the restaurant , we were seated at a high top in the bar. We ordered our food and asked that everything come together since we were in a hurry. Our order was for bacon ranch quesadillas, loaded fries, a steak, and a bacon cheeseburger . We watched table after table come in after us and get here food, and in some cases leave , before out food came. When our food came out it was cold and the steak, ordered medium rare, was past med well. I don't have high standards from a steak at Chilis so wouldn't have been a deal breaker except for the way management handled it. The manager came over and asked how things were and I asked him if my steak looked med rare. He said it looked medium to him. I said ' based in the photos given on the menu it's well done'. He then tells me the pics on the menu are ""ridiculous"". Then you might not want to use them as a guide for how your valued customers should order?!?!?!  Then he proceeds to argue with me saying others got their food earlier because they ordered sandwiches. When I pointed out that one table had sliders and the other had chicken fried steaks he walked away and i never saw him again. The waiter then came over and pointed out that he gave us $3 off. Not about the money ..... It's about the customer experience!!!!! Could have easily been handled professionally and would have been forgotten by now .... Instead I wouldn't go back to this Chilis if I was starving and it was the only place in town.

7,Darwin C.,"Schertz, TX",4,7,,3.0,2016-08-20,My family and I went to Chili's for lunch after 5 yrs since our previous location did not have any in our area. It was a late lunch so e place was not busy at all. Our food took about 20 mins before it got to our table. By then my pasta tasted warm and the chicken seemed like it was frozen and cooked directly onto the grill. It was tasty but pasta served as luke warm is not as good.  Maybe it was just past the lunch hour rush or the cooks were slow or not enough cooks in the kitchen. Whatever it was the overall service and quality was average for me. My kids love to go to Chili's but we'll just have to try other places to make the comparison.  Hope this helps choosing which spot to go to.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-selma,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44

Today I came in and I had the triple dipper with southwestern egg rolls, burger bites, and boneless buffalo wings. For an appetizer I had the cheese bites and the chips and salsa with the skillet queso. Everything was delicious. I also had a platinum margarita which is always very tasty.

I happen to love Chilis but last Wednesday my family went there and it was the worst service I have ever had anywhere. We went in at 9pm with a party of 14 which i know is alot but we were willing to be patient. The host said it would be a bit before we were sat but then after 20 mins and about half the restaurant empty we started to ask if we could push some tables together to atleast be seated and the host said NO. We waited another 10 mins with nothing changing and were told we would have to sit in seperate tables since they were refusing to push tables together in an empty area. We agreed. We waited another 10 minutes and the manager rudly came out to tell us we were a large party and were inconveniencing them and if we wanted to stay we had to sit in seperate table which we told him we had agreed to 10 minutes ago. Finally after 45 minutes of waiting and rude service we were seated. Not only were we sat in 3 different tables they werent even close to eachother. We sat at tables for 10 minutes with no service and decided to leave. If i could give them zero stars i would.

I was under the impression that it was going to be one of those nights where it's just all going to be bad. However, the server, Tina I believe, was very polite and took our food and drink order immediately.
