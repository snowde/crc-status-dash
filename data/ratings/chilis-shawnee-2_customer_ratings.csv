5,Steve R.,"Shawnee, OK",368,211,39.0,2.0,2012-07-04,"This Chili's is teeny-tiny, so you're in for a wait. Then you gotta gauge whether the wait will be worth it. Chili's can be a fun atmosphere, and that's what they've got going for them more than yummy food. Definitely use their call-ahead seating to minimize your wait. On this visit, we just wanted a couple appetizers and a glass of wine. It didn't end well. We were told by our server they ""have ran out of a lot of wines this week."" Our first THREE choices were a no-go, so we opted to just have water, cram down our so-so nachos and open our own bottle of wine at home on the deck. I'm a little picky, so take that into consideration too. Chili's is not the enemy :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-shawnee-2,,,,,
7,Steve S.,"Seminole, OK",2,62,,1.0,2012-08-18,There we at least 6 tables open for parties of 6. We checked in with 3. We were told a 30 minute wait. Ummm no way in heck! We are outta here!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-shawnee-2,,,,,
4,Kaye m.,"Shawnee, OK",1,28,2.0,2.0,2014-07-09,"I would love to love this place again.  Food is slow coming out and if they are busy,  usually overcooked.  Bar drinks are inconsistent,  you never know what your margarita is going to taste like.  Managers need to step up and bring this place back to par.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-shawnee-2,,,,,
6,Jessica J.,"Shawnee, OK",0,7,,2.0,2014-07-14,"The food definitely leaves something to be desired...and I have frequented MANY Chili's. This week the Quesadillas were burnt...last time the chips were mushy and stuck together. While I am a faithful Chili's supporter, this location needs to work on its food preparation.  The wait staff is extremely helpful, not too pushy, and friendly and the atmosphere is great- more TVs than any Chili's I have been to in GA, TN, or AL.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-shawnee-2,,,,,
3,Amanda B.,"McLoud, OK",0,12,6.0,2.0,2015-04-09,"They have one black bean party for vegetarians.  The menu is huge, and they really phoned it in.  The two times I've had a black bean burger it was dry and freezer burned.  Even BURGER KING has a veggie burger on their tiny menu.  I know it's small town Oklahoma, but come on. A chain restaurant really has no excuse.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-shawnee-2,,,,,
2,Kimberly M.,"Tecumseh, OK",0,18,2.0,4.0,2016-05-01,"We went here for dinner and we had an awesome waiter, he got everything perfect! I had taken 2 bites of my food and found a hair in it. The waiter promptly apologized and had my food remade. The manager brought my food out and it was made wrong. She immediately had it remade and left the wrong plate with me so I could pick at it while I waited, if I wanted to. The Manger apologized and comped our meal. They were very professional and very nice. We love this place and will be back. I would have given it 5 stars, but there was a hair in my food. ;-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-shawnee-2,,,,,
0,John C.,"Oklahoma City, OK",159,16,7.0,3.0,2016-06-10,"I'm usually very satisfied with this place. Tonight was a bit of a mixed review. Our server was very overworked. The entire atmosphere of the wait staff just seemed hectic. The management needs to do some extra training on multitasking while staying connected to the customer in front of you. I'll start with the pros of our visit. My wife got the shrimp and steak fajitas with corn tortillas. She thought they were excellent, aside from the tortillas falling to pieces as a result of being under cooked. My son devoured his chicken strips as always. My shrimp tacos were delicious. Similar to my wife, my tortillas were undercooked and falling to pieces. It was still delicious, just a bit frustrating. Now for the negative. I had to ask three different times for some lemons with my water (1st world problem). I've saved the worst for last. I asked for some hot sauce and what I received was a VERY DIRTY bottle of Tabasco. When I say dirty, I'm not referring to some dried hot sauce outside of the bottle. I mean DIRTY as in the label was faded and looked like a vintage piece from a time capsule. I also mean DIRTY as in there was literally DIRT and DUST on the entire outside of the bottle. This thing seriously looked like it had been stored in a dirt floor basement. My first thoughts were that this nasty thing just came from the kitchen. If the food prep environment looks anything like that bottle.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-shawnee-2,,,,,
1,Kim L.,"Bethel Park, PA",0,2,,1.0,2017-04-02,"Last time I'll eat here, first the waitress bugged the crap out of me, rushing me to order.. I ordered an appetizer first,  waited, waited and waited some more. The entire time our waitress was jacking jaw with another server. Finally our food came out followed 5 minutes later by another little girl with our appetizer, it was queso and was hard and disgusting at that point. Didn't see the waitress again. Sorry chilis you need to work harder, the entire chain has gone to shit!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-shawnee-2,,,,,
