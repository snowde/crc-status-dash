34,Vanessa R.,"Skull Valley, AZ",1,37,2.0,1.0,2014-04-26,"This is place has everything wrong with it. We walked in and all the empty tables were dirty, the booster seat we were handed was covered in grease and salt but the waitress pretended she didn't see us cleaning it off. Food took almost an hour to get to us and that was in 3 trips with the last person getting their food almost 20 minutes after the first. My grilled shrimp tacos looked nothing like the picture and they were definitely not grilled, they also came with a nice little piece of bone. We were only comped for part of my meal since I didn't find a bone in the taco I ate, the rice or Beans. Never again will we come here, I should've known from previous reviews to go to the Bossier one instead but this one was so much closer, definitely not worth the 5 minute drive we saved.

28,Rachel B.,"Shreveport, LA",11,8,,1.0,2014-08-24,Terrible experience here.  We waited 20 minutes for chips and queso.  Complained to the manager and we finally got it.  The waitress then took our order- we waited 1 hour for our food.  When we got it we sent it back.  My friends hamburger tasted like salt on a bun - literally and my fajitas were cold.  It was 1 o'clock on Friday.  They were not busy - just super slow.  We won't ever be back! :(,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-shreveport?start=20,1.5400000000000003,1.5400000000000003,1.5400000000000003,1.5400000000000003,1.5400000000000003

26,Holly W.,"Haughton, LA",16,34,70.0,1.0,2014-09-29,"Worst Chili's I have ever been to. Outside was dirty, trash cans needed to be emptied, plants all dead in the rock beds. Inside looked dirty too, our table looked like it hadn't even been wiped down, most of the empty tables were either dirty or needed to be wiped down. Waited about 10 minutes for a waitress to at least get our drink order, but no one came. We decided to leave.

20,Jason C.,"Fort Smith, AR",17,17,8.0,1.0,2014-11-25,Worst experience I have ever had at a Chili's restaurant. Placed a ToGo order and showed up at the time stated on the order. Took 5 minutes for someone to acknowledge your existence at the Take Out counter. Several other customers waiting for their orders as well. My order was finally brought out 15 minutes after the promised time without any apologies for being late. Horrible customer service and I will never be returning to this location. Go somewhere else and hope for better service. The manager should be ashamed to have his name on this restaurant.  At least they got my order right.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-shreveport?start=20,1.5080000000000002,1.5080000000000002,1.5080000000000002,1.5080000000000002,1.5080000000000005
14,Mike A.,"Chicago, IL",41,697,246.0,1.0,2015-01-08,"This review will be short and sweet: Came in on a Tuesday night and after the hostess wiped down the seats and table; sat down.  - Waited 10 min for waiter.  Told him I was ready to order, placed order for soft drink, app and dinner.  - Waited 15 min. No sign of soft drink,  saw the waiter deliver a drink to another table. After 25 min of just sitting looking at an empty table: WALKED OUT; telling the hostess to inform my waiter to cancel the order. The place was not busy, so to completely ignore a customer is unacceptable. Based on other reviews, I assume the management at this location is clueless!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-shreveport,,,,,
18,Jeff N.,"Bossier City, LA",1,5,,1.0,2015-04-09,"I will not be eating at this Chilis any time soon.  The whole restaurant seemed dirty and humid and there were bugs on the table.  Also, It took the appetizer (chips and queso) 30 minutes to arrive, the drinks were wrong, and the main course arrived after an hour and did not include the French fries which arrived 20 minutes later and was only for 1 person instead of 3...probably would have been longer had I not said we were about to leave.   Food is average and not worth the wait for the price and poor service. I also would like to mention that they messed up the order on the table next to us as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-shreveport,,,,,
12,Joel M.,"Shreveport, LA",5,62,118.0,2.0,2015-04-10,I've been here many times over the years and sadly the experience is always forgettable.  The food is only mediocre.  The service is usually good and the staff are usually polite but the food is just not very good.  A major downside to this restaurant is the noise level.  It is so loud in here you can't even carry on a conversation with the person sitting across from you.  There's no door to the kitchen so all that noise added to every table trying to scream over each other added to the mediocre food makes this an experience you could totally pass on.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-shreveport,,,,,
23,Don'Chunte F.,"Dallas, TX",1,16,,1.0,2015-06-20,"The slowest service ever. We even witnessed a table of teenaged girls getting poor, rushed service. This is after they had to wait an extended period of time for their food. Don't bother.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-shreveport?start=20,,,,,
7,Billy Joe J.,"Shreveport, LA",1163,660,16263.0,1.0,2015-06-28,"Sometimes you're just doomed from the get-go. Fate sends you spiraling down a path that you didn't plan, nor intend, and yet it leads you to the most unlikely, and unexpected of places, and in this particular instance also the most undesired.  So, as it were, we set off on a Sunday afternoon for our preferred destination of local neighborhood Tex-Mex haunt, El Potrillo, and upon entering this other restaurant, we were informed that their credit-debit card machines were down, and they could only accept cash or check? Ok. Cash. Who carries cash on their personage these days, and check? What is this, Little House on the Prairie? The Waltons? Here's my hand-written promissory note for dry goods and services. So, we exit El Potrillo unfulfilled (and unfilled) and unsure of where to go next. And there was this Chili's right across the parking lot. It didn't seem that busy and there wasn't a wait, and I can quite honestly say, I have not been to a Chili's since at least 2009! It's just not really my scene. But here it was unexpected and convenient.  Upon a quick look through the menu, I knew I was in trouble. No lunch menu or specials on weekends. (Of course!) and there is virtually nothing, NO-THING, that doesn't add up to at least about ten bucks a person on their cheesey menu. Not a burger. Not an appetizer. Not a one of em ain't staring back at you for less than ten bucks! Really! And when did appetizers become comparably priced to entrees? Remember when apps were at least a few bucks cheaper? Just ridiculous!  So, I ordered the skillet queso and a bowl of their Chili. Two of the cheapest items I could find. The queso was a revolting, tasteless, brown mushy goo of a disaster! Ugh. Ick! The bowl of chili came much later, cold to the touch of the palate, and the cheese wasn't even melted on top, it was still recognizably grated into individual shards, and was as disgusting and as tasteless as the queso, but the chili went the extra inch with a negative temperature and a yucky, all-too-chewy texture, that makes one wonder, 'Is this really beef, or could it be something else?'  I got the bill for just my end and with tax and tip, I walked out completely unsatisfied, disappointed, and mostly revolted for a bill over $15.00.  This experience not only turned me off of Chili's maybe quite possibly forever, but also from eating out altogether for the time being!  It was soooo nastyeee!! : ( So gross! Worst fifteen bucks I've ever spent, ever!  I'm equally as mad at El Potrillo and their unreliable credit-debit card machines and I blame them at least partially for unwittingly sending me Into this horrific dining experience! Muchas Gracias, El Potrillo!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-shreveport,,,,,

15,Tricia G.,"Bossier City, LA",66,110,78.0,2.0,2015-08-10,"Thought we'd grab a quick bite here after a long morning of shopping. Unfortunately, there was nothing quick about it. Despite lots of empty (and dirty tables) and lots of waitstaff standing around, it took a while for us to be waited on, and longer to get food and drinks (about 45 minutes). I sent my chili back after it came so cold that the cheese wouldn't melt and full of chunks of fatty gristle.  Absolutely disgusting. The server was ok, but seemed indifferent and would disappear for long periods of time.  I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. There are much better and healthier options nearby.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-shreveport,,,,,

We walked in the door and were greeted slightly by the two girls standing in the front. We sat in the bar area because we thought it would be quicker.  Our server was HORRIBLE! Worst service I have had in a long time. She wasnt genuine at all, didnt check in with us often and just didnt care. She dropped or food off at the table and began talking to the table next to us. The food came out at a decent time after we order but wasnt a little warmer than room temperature.

Funny, she told everyone 5-10 minutes.  20 minutes for the drinks to come out after we asked the waitress if we could order and had to ask again to order appetizers and food. Waitress carried the bottle beer to the table tucked under her arm. Another waiter brought the appetzers out, cold.

The sweet tea was fresh and delicious. I like that they adjusted the air conditioning to match the outside cold air temp. Many places will leave it cranked up no matter the outside temp. I didn't freeze during my meal.  The server was helpful in suggesting items and attentive throughout our meal.

No one even acknowledged us. WE WERE SEEN, we were not, however, helped or acknowledged. When my family and I decided to just go somewhere else, the bar area waitress looked up at us and smirked.

Our server was cordial, but his service felt rushed. He rarely stopped by, forgot to give my kids their utensils, and our food was lukewarm as if it were sitting for a while. Unsatisfied with my dinner, I ordered a molten lava cake because how can that be messed up? Well it was! The cake arrived warm. I knew it had not been thoroughly heated all the way because the chocolate core was still solid. Ugh! I did see the worker in the back heating up the cake in the microwave. While it was heating, she opened the microwave and attempted to squeeze another plate of someone else's cake in with ours! I clearly saw what happened from our table.

Sometimes, depending upon the cook and the restaurant location, the fries will have seasoning on it. Today they were void of seasoning. Oh well. I hamburger was hot and fresh, however when i actually ate it, it started to cool down, why? Glad you asked. I ordered it with mayo. Sandwich ain't a sandwich without mayo. The waitress forgot. Then getting the drink order, appetizers etc...to her other tabled, my hamburger sat, waiting on mayo. Didn't know it came with a ton of mustard on it thou. I just used my knife and scraped it off.
