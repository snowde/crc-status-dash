8,Leslie S.,"Singapore, Singapore",83,139,617.0,2.0,2012-12-31,"The food is of ok portions and ok taste but with a slightly above average price. We were sitting at these tall tables at the back where the air condition is very cold so we shifted our tables. One of the waitresses chided us for moving the tables without their permission. After which we were afraid to say anything back or to feedback for fear that waiters or waitresses spit in our food. Gosh, why do we have to endure bad service and non-ethical behaviour in our F&B world? I will never visit there again. There are other places that served better food and provides better services.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-singapore-3,,,,,
10,Ancy N.,"Singapore, Singapore",72,592,1986.0,2.0,2013-03-18,It is a 2.5 stars for me. Docked half star for price. Standard American fare that seems overpriced. My quesadillas were $20 at lunch.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-singapore-3,,,,,
16,Sonya C.,"Singapore, Singapore",90,277,303.0,3.0,2013-09-16,"as-you'd-expect - which is to say, good for simple, filling meals - at this american tex-mex chain outlet at the central in clarke quay. let's cut to the chase: this isn't gourmet, and it's not trying to be. it's full-on american diner-steakhouse type food served in large portions, and it (almost singlehandedly, actually) fills a niche gap in the singapore dining scene that I think many of us didn't know existed. it's casual dining in a large space with very-american-style diner booth seats, incredibly enthusiastic staff, and a boisterous atmosphere that lends best to loud gatherings (impression fostered also by their myriad alcohol promotions) - but all that aside, this place has a killer banbread pudding: one of the best, most satisfying non-chocolate puddings I've had in a while. in a food scene dominated by open kitchens manned by skinny tight-trousered intensely-styled chefs, this establishment feels a little out of place. at best, it's esoteric; at most-impolite, it's probably best described as crass. but.. that's not necessarily as bad as it sounds, and not a bad thing neither. it's (lack of supposed) pedigree is visible in the cheese-encrusted steaks and cheese-surrounded most-things-else - but it's fun, you know. I wouldn't dress up to come here (and you don't need to, either), but if your friends appreciate a loud place to indulge in margharitas and too-much food - this would be my best recommendation. the gist of it: you really should come here for as americanesque a meal as you're likely to get in singapore. the food is decent, and the prices aren't cheap - but the portion sizes give it huge value (especially if you consider that the same money would bring you tapas-type servings in hippie places), and coming with a large group of friends will mean a good time. or just come for margharitas and their dessert - I've heard great things about that chocolate cake too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-singapore-3,,,,,
11,Josh T.,"Singapore, Singapore",100,243,226.0,3.0,2013-10-27,"Chili's, like Tony Roma's and Outback, and ""those types of places"" are really just as advertised. Hearty, fairly affordable American fare for the masses. And while dinner here is a perfectly average affair of typical choices at typical prices, I do appreciate Chili's as somewhere near my clients that I can grab a quick lunch. For between $16-18 dollars you can get a half portion of soup, and a half portion of salad, or a sandwich, including a free flow drink. That's... decent. It's a nice change of pace when you're sick of eating the same thing from the area around the office everryyyyday.  I can confidently say I'll go back, once in a while. It's nowhere I'd 'recommend to a friend', or visit because it's a special occasion, but in a way it's a like McDonald's for grown-ups. Simple, stable, kinda fast food that doesn't make for any surprises. We all need something familiar every once in a while!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-singapore-3,,,,,
17,Alaine H.,"Singapore, Singapore",643,283,354.0,4.0,2014-02-19,"I find myself here every now and then because I teach dance around the area. I almost always sit at the bar area to order my buffalo chicken salad or lunch special. I've been watching the Winter Olympics and they put it on the tv for me. Nice folks that work here for the most part. The food is ok. I think the lunch special for $9 is a decent deal because you can get a small BLT, small salad, and small fries - perfect amount of food for lunch with variety and includes a drink too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-singapore-3,,,,,
15,Julie T.,"Singapore, Singapore",11,26,40.0,5.0,2014-05-24,i always go back here. i just love the food and their service :) bottomless tostada and veggie quesadilla and the classic nachos are a few of my fave. :),https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-singapore-3,,,,,
12,Polly L.,"San Francisco, CA",276,114,140.0,1.0,2014-06-04,"Studying abroad from America, we all thought going to Chili's would be something comforting and will remind us of home but not really. First of all, the prices are way way way jacked up (also because it's in Clarke Quay). We had a table of 10 and got seated outside so the waiters never got to us. I got guac, salsa and chips but it just didn't taste right. I love Chili's in America, and it has quite decent food but this Chili's definitely does not live up to that standard.  Since we were seated outside, they didn't really pay attention to us. It was really hard to get their attention, had to go inside to tell them. The worst thing that happened during dinner was that our friend got her meal when we were all done. When we all got our food, we asked them and they kept telling us 10mins. 10mins later, another 15mins. It was ridiculous. At the end, the manager came out to tell us that they actually forgot her order and it will come out in 10mins. By that time, our friend was so hungry, she wasn't even hungry anymore. In the end, they gave us that meal for free but it just wasn't worth the hassle.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-singapore-3,,,,,
14,Simon F.,"London, United Kingdom",0,5,4.0,2.0,2014-09-23,"Well you kinda know what you are in for, however, I found the service was lackadaisical and the food was prepared and tasted like it was uncared for too.  This is a glorified MacDonald's.  The beer was good, but that came in a bottle.  Go for something more local, with more soul.  Considering the quality I would rate this as expensive, considering the whole package.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-singapore-3,,,,,
7,Ida C.,"Singapore, Singapore",333,437,852.0,4.0,2015-01-26,"Oh Chili's, why can't I quit you? Perhaps it's your glorious chips, ethereally thin and perfectly crispy with more salt than I ever need to eat in one sitting... Truly the most perfect tortilla chips in Singapore, perhaps the world! Perhaps it's the curiously appealing, Tex Mex / Asian fusion Southwest Spring Rolls... With the completely unnecessary, but totally appropriate ranch doing sauce? Perhaps it's just remembering the good old days in college, hanging out at Chili's where my friends worked, milking the free refills and bottomless chips and occasional free dessert. Most likely it's the amalgamation of all of these things that makes Chili's a guilty sentimental pleasure.  One thing's for sure... I'll not be quitting it anytime soon! PARTING THOUGHT: bring your passion card and save 10% off your bill!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-singapore-3,,,,,
2,Michelle M.,Hong Kong,1461,1252,5829.0,2.0,2015-03-17,"I've been to this outlet on a few occasions and I've decided that the burgers should be skipped. I stopped by here hoping to enjoy a hearty meal before heading to my next meeting. I ordered from their lunch specials, and chose a Caesar salad and double cheese burger. The salad was fine, but the cheeseburger, though cheesy, had dry patties. The fries were also not fresh, as they were more chewy than crisp. For $18.75, you're better off just going to Burger King or McDonald's for something that costs a quarter of the price and would probably taste better. The only good thing about the lunch specials is that the soda refills are free; none of that $1-extra-to-top-up funny business. However, their baby back ribs and other Tex-Mex dishes appear okay. But if you're in the Clarke Quay area, I'd rather you visit some of the other restaurants in the upper levels of Central Mall for better chances of satisfying grub.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-singapore-3,,,,,
9,Jay S.,"Singapore, Singapore",26,84,94.0,4.0,2015-05-04,"I've always gone to the Tanglin location, but this time I was down getting a dependant pass at RiverWalk and decided to stop in for a rare weekday lunch with my wife.  This Chili's is really nice, it's very bright and open with a wall of glass, feels much newer than the Tanglin location.  The food is standard Chili's food, if you don't know, this is casual American food with a tex-mex twist, but still a full varied menu of choices. I have always enjoyed Chili's food since I worked in one over fifteen years ago. The menu has changed a lot over the years and some favorites have left (I will always miss you Smoked Turkey Sandwich) but many new items have been added to round out the selection. My favorite feature of Singapore Chili's is the unlimited drink refills, that really takes me home to the US. I was very pleased to see the Weekday lunch break promotion starting at $12.90 you get a starter, a main and a free flow drink. While the portions are a bit smaller, a few less fries, smaller main salad, at SGD12.90 this is a fantastic deal. The food took a bit long to come out for a lunch promotion in a fairly empty restaurant, but overall very good experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-singapore-3,,,,,
5,John Q.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",72,427,1667.0,3.0,2015-05-31,"This Chili's is located right in a central area near bus stops and the MRT. It is in a prime position and was even quite busy at the off-peak 3-5pm period. Unfortunately, they have very few people staffed to run the large dining area. Thus, things can be a bit slow and you definitely have to grab someone to get any attention. Otherwise, the food is as good as any Chili's I've been to. The chips and salsa are always a good choice, as their tortillas are paper thin and crispy. The fajitas are one of the classic choices as well and may be enough for two to share unless you have a big appetite. If you know what to expect from a Chili's and want to have it, then you should not be disappointed by this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-singapore-3,,,,,
13,Ben H.,"Energy Corridor, Houston, TX",26,10,7.0,1.0,2015-05-31,"Ok, you expect the price to be high..you are in Singapore. But the service is horrible. The hostess wanted to sit me in a crowded spot, and the restaurant was less than half full. I asked if I could sit at another table. She barked ""SECTION CLOSED!"" I asked about another empty table, she barked again. Finally a guy came over and let us sit there. After a long wait, a woman came over acting irritated, to take our drink order. Drinks came, and she shoved my hand putting mine in front of me. She took our food order. Again, acting irritated. The food was mediocre, and the condiments with the fajitas are about 1 tbsp in volume. To sum up, expect $30/person and bad service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-singapore-3,,,,,
6,Bern T.,"Singapore, Singapore",1,80,,3.0,2016-04-29,"Chili's is one of my favourite places for Tex-Mex cuisine. And ribs! Because we regularly hit up the original branch at Tanglin Mall, comparisons between that and its sister outlet at The Central were inevitably drawn when we dined there last weekend. Service differs, the Tanglin Mall one being better staffed, with more efficient service, whereas the staff at Clarke Quay were a little more frazzled and bumbling. Food, too, was a little lackluster at Clarke Quay compared to the commendable grub at Tanglin Mall. Clearly, the standards between the branches are inconsistent; I'll probably stick to the Tanglin Mall branch. We had: 1) Beef Chili ($12.50): This was a little charred compared to the ones at Tanglin Mall, like someone left it on the burner a tad too long. Still a decent starter nonetheless. 2) Chicken Enchilada Soup ($9.90): subtly spiced, and really lovely, if a bit stingy on the chicken chunks. 3) Bacon Ranch Quesadillas ($24.90): these were a little anaemic, and significantly less generous with the fillings than at Tanglin Mall. 4) Mango Chile Chicken ($19.90): wholesome, healthy, and delicious. The chicken was very nicely done, moist, flavourful and tender. 5) Grilled Chicken Fajitas ($27.90): one of the highlights. Succulent chicken, thoroughly marinated, and imbued with an aromatic smoky accent. 6) Classic BBQ Baby Back Ribs ($40.90 for full rack): outstanding as usual, hearty, flavoursome to the bone, fantastically burnished, with meat that was so tender it was practically fall-off-the-bone. This was served with excellent homestyle fries and a disappointingly dry skillet macaroni & cheese",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-singapore-3,,,,,
4,Kelvin N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",2,8,27.0,2.0,2016-08-29,"Rude staff. We came in as a group. We had our lunch. While some of us were still having the food, I walked out to grab a Starbucks coffee nearby and walked back in to join the rest. Those two waiters/greeters at the front show an attitude that obviously say: you are not wellcome (back) with that drinks on hands. Annoyed And unwelcome I feel. Never come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-singapore-3,,,,,
3,Emerald P.,"El Cajon, CA",68,127,139.0,4.0,2016-11-26,"Service was very slow when we walked in, But the chili was to die for! It was nice and spicy!very safe food for any American traveling and not ready to indulge in the local food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-singapore-3,,,,,
1,Ste B.,"Singapore River, Singapore, Singapore",0,2,,4.0,2017-05-28,"Quite impressed really,  Wanted a quick, inexpensive meal - fajitas was perfectly good.  Location excellent and better value and service than many of the riverside eateries behind Clarke Quay",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-singapore-3,,,,,
0,Saarthak C.,"Reno, NV",175,57,210.0,4.0,2018-01-11,"Although I haven't had this in the United States, I decided to try it out in Singapore and was not disappointed at all. I had the chicken burrito and a margarita. The burrito was very tasty and the margarita wasn't diluted, much to my surprise especially since I had ordered it as a lunch special. The waiter was friendly and prompt. Our order was out in no time. The place had quite a few diners too, and so definitely a popular outlet.  Overall, quick service and good food. A good place to grab a quick bite for lunch",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-singapore-3,,,,,
