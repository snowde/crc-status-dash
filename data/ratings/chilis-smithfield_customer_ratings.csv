34,Luke L.,"Coventry, RI",3,21,,1.0,2012-02-10,Waitress/Bartender cracked jokes about my coworker's appearance the entire visit.  She was left with no tip.  We will never go back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-smithfield?start=20,2.5320000000000005,2.5320000000000005,2.5320000000000005,2.5320000000000005,2.5320000000000005
24,Joseph D.,"Providence, RI",82,75,44.0,4.0,2012-03-09,"I love Chilis... yeah i said it.  Its one of my guilty ""restaurant chain"" pleasures.  Not sure what all the gripes are about.  I have been in this location half a dozen times and the service was always quick and friendly, the chips I have never experienced to be overly greasy, but it is a ""fried"" product.  And the salsa, which can be watery at times in my recent experience, was thick and spicy.  But come on, I'm going in for the Margaritas.... god I love tequila.  And to my surprise, they consistently pour a stiff drink, even the $5 specials do not skimp on the alcohol, so in my opinion, for a decent drink, some chips and salsa, and amazing southwest eggrolls... I will roll into this Chilis anytime.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-smithfield?start=20,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003
32,Steven P.,"Chepachet, RI",102,122,,3.0,2012-03-10,"One of the better Chili's locations with a friendly staff and consistently good food. Came in late on a weeknight with a party of six, and though the place was mostly empty, the dining room was a bit disheveled and the staff still seemed to be frantic. Despite whatever the distraction happened to be, our service was good and the food good as well. I had a mushroom Swiss burger which was big and juicy, and the fries were fresh and hot. The bowl of chili I ordered as an appetizer could have used a lot of help, however -- too soupy and lacking in hearty ingredients. If you're going to call yourself ""Chili's"" you might want to offer decent bowl of chili on the menu -- just a suggestion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-smithfield?start=20,2.668,2.668,2.668,2.668,2.668
31,Robert G.,"Blackstone, MA",1,73,62.0,2.0,2012-11-16,"We stopped for lunch and sat at the bar. Bar person was friendly, although she was alone with a number of customers and was busy. My pomagranate margarita was very good. The chips were too thin. When putting them into dips they broke apart. My ribs were ok but did not seem fresh. My wife enjoyed her chicken. We had not been into a Chillis for a long time. It was ok.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-smithfield?start=20,2.504,2.504,2.504,2.504,2.504
22,Marco D.,"Cranston, RI",17,150,31.0,3.0,2012-12-30,"Went to Chili's with my parents.  The entire reason for this review is the new burger they have. The guacamole burger is amazing.  Best burger I've had in a while.  They served my mom a piña colada with a huge long hair on top if it, made them take it back and they promptly brought another one.  Eh, shit happens I guess.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-smithfield?start=20,2.636,2.636,2.636,2.636,2.636

The quality of food seems to have improved since I was last at a Chili's.

19,Dani H.,"Somerville, MA",198,30,2.0,4.0,2013-10-05,"I was in town for the Rock 'n' Roll Providence Half Marathon so my friends and I decided to hit up Chili's since 2 of our crew is Gluten Free. There were 4 of us total and we were on a bit of a budget so we decided to do the 2 for $20 dealio. It included a set menu of choices to pick from, but the deal included an appetizer and 2 entrees. We were in! My friend's boyfriend and I went with the chipotle chicken flatbread (yummy, but definitely had a kick ;)) then I got the Margarita Grilled chicken (from the lighter choices menu) and he got the fajitas. Both entrees were tasty and full of flavor. Since I had the half marathon I had double carbs as my side - rice and mashed potatoes - and both were good. My 2 gluten free friends split the 2 for $20 deal as well and got the salsa/guacamole, mango-chile talapia and mango-chile chicken. They both loved that it was gluten free, but were not ready for the big taste of chile. It was a tad spicy for both of their liking, but they still ate it all. :) We didn't want to wait for a table so we sat in the bar and had nice quick service, which was appreciated. Our waitress joked with us, but made sure nothing was missing from our order. The 2 for $20 deal was awesome. We ended up spending more on drinks than food. ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-smithfield,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.736
15,JLynn C.,"Coventry, RI",591,337,2382.0,3.0,2013-11-19,I would give this Chili's 4 stars for food only and 3 for the service. The take out order was ready quickly and the food was as expected but the person behind the bar doing the to go orders was not friendly at all...actually extremely rude. Not my problem you are a miserable person who hates their job. Anyway I'd still eat from there again because the food is good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-smithfield,2.572,2.572,2.572,2.572,2.5720000000000005
27,Elena N.,"Providence, RI",109,67,20.0,2.0,2013-12-27,"Just waited 45 minutes for a salad & kid's chicken tenders. I was told the quesadilla explosion salad was huge but it was weak. Barely any corn & beans, quesadillas were cold & cheese congealed. The kid's meal fries were leather & tenders were blazing hot & filled with grease. I only give 2 stars bc the wait staff is super friendly and they replaced my daughter's meal with the quickness. Good people, bad food.

12,Liz M.,"North Providence, RI",131,346,375.0,5.0,2014-03-27,I'm usually not a fan of chain restaurants but  really enjoy the food here. The portions are decent sized and I eat here two times a week without a mess up of my food. Laurie is my favorite bartender there she always remembers my order and chats with me which is great because I usually go to lunch alone. Great place for a quick lunch.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-smithfield,,,,,
33,Sharon D.,"Johnston, RI",0,5,,2.0,2014-04-01,"Got ""Chili's To Go"" for the first time from this location last Saturday.  I ordered the Rib Eye done medium, with side of steamed broccoli and Caesar salad.  I only live less than a mile from there; when I got back to my house with the food, it was cold, and the steak was completely overcooked.  Takeout was not properly packaged at all, and when picking it up, had to stand and wait for the bartender to finish serving everyone their drinks while my order sat getting cold.  The restaurant needs to better coordinate the take out service.  I won't be paying $30 bucks again for cold food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-smithfield?start=20,,,,,
26,Geoffrey H.,"North Attleborough, MA",6,21,8.0,4.0,2014-05-09,"This is an excellent location for a after work bar meet-up. The staff is very friendly and the bar room adapts well to large groups. This particular Chili's has an excellent bar staff (at least at the time this review was written) and is one of our favorite after work destinations for going away parties. As far as food goes this is just another Chili's so expect a similar level of pretty consistent Chili's food. I'd recommend going for the lighter options to avoid the salt & fat, otherwise, this is a great place to spend some time with friends, drinks and appetizers. Thanks guys.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-smithfield?start=20,,,,,
11,Joe C.,"Greenville, RI",1868,753,94.0,2.0,2014-09-09,"Crappy Chain What can I say, salt, salt, and more salt.  For some reason I feel like Chili's was better a decade ago.  Now it is pretty average at best.   The staff is always pretty nice and they do have a decent half price menu, but in the end it's a cheesy chain that is definitely giving people high blood pressure.   Tip:  Best day to go is on Monday, 2 for 1 fajitas.   Sorry to say there are so many other better places to go out to eat. Thanks",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-smithfield,,,,,
23,Dave S.,"Greenville, RI",1,8,10.0,2.0,2014-10-24,Although the bar is a great deal for the money after 9 pm the dinning room/dinner menu has become nothing short of disgusting!  They have cut so many corners with the food quality that it is barely what I would even consider food!  The signature sizzling fajitas has gotten so nasty that i cant even smell the brown grossness they bring your peppers and onions and what they consider meat on!  Drop the stupid sizzling plate already its stupid and only clutters your tables!  Seriously if they dont start making changes they will not last as a whole!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-smithfield?start=20,,,,,
20,Ivana M.,"Johnston, RI",0,1,,2.0,2015-01-23,Last night my husband and I came into your restaurant for supper and we both ordered Buffalo chicken salads.  I noticed something was different but my husband did not notice.  I just went on line and realized that there were no tortilla chips in our salads.  This is the second time we had a problem there.   On another occasion I ordered Spicy Shrimp tacos and my shrimp were not fully cooked.  When I order them now I have to remind the server to please make sure the shrimp is pink.   We come to the restaurant almost every week and we live close by so I would hate not to give it a try again.   Please talk to your staff.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-smithfield?start=20,,,,,
14,Tess W.,"Sterling, CT",21,140,63.0,3.0,2015-02-16,"Quick meal. Got the (looked like chicken tortilla) soup and a cuppa hot tea. It was quite decent and kept me from buying the whole of Dave's when I went shopping later. I have seen some comments about the salt and I agree. Just ask for no added salt. I had the tamales once, good but salty. No way to remove the salt from them. I did ask the manager about the salty food, someone needs to taste these things before they send them out. I got out of there for $7. Not counting tip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-smithfield,,,,,

Had to ask for drink refills and the bottomless chips and salsa refill only got offered after we were told a manager would bring our food.  Left after 5 more minutes when manager never showed.  Decided I was done being lied to.  Possibly the worst customer service experience ever in food service.  Congrats.  You will be a case study.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-smithfield,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96

From entering and being greeted with a smile everything from there was pleasant all the way until we left.  Our servers name was Cassandra she was so sweet and understanding and patient with us. She greeted us with a smile and told us about some deals , answered all our questions and helped us with choosing. They had this amazing 35.00 deal which was 1 appetizer to share , 2 entrees , 2 alcoholic beverages and 1 desert to share , that's a DEAL! The food was great, we really enjoyed it, but the drinks that was another story.  The customer service was amazing. We hated the drinks and I explained nicely we didn't like them and right away Cassandra took them deducted them and got us new drinks. With no problem , she was so sweet. I was so happy with how great she did to accommodate us.  Each course came out on time and didn't take forever. I really admire this place and I will be back more. I hope Cassandra gets acknowledged because she did amazing! Thanks again for the great food guys!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-smithfield,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004
16,Jesse P.,"Smithfield, RI",0,2,,1.0,2016-02-27,"Absolutely terrible service. Waitress had no idea what she was doing and ignored us. It took a half hour to get a soup the size of a small coffee cup, and our fries. And then food came out right after, great timing! The food was cold and disgusting, it didn't look fresh at all, it looked like someone heated up leftovers. I'm sick as I'm writing this. This isn't even a joke, the food and service was that bad, never going to any of these restaurants again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-smithfield,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92

We (date and myself) were given two waitresses, not sure why, but both were great. I ordered a strawberry patron margarita and highly recommend it an anyone, I absolutely love it. We shared a Texas cheese fry appetizer, they didn't seem to have peppered the fries like usual, but they were still good. As for our lunches, I ordered the new prime rib fresh Mex bowl, and he ordered the prime rib burrito. My bowl was decent, however, I feel like I would've gotten better had I gone to the Chipotle across the parking lot. My date faired better, I tried his dish and it was delicious, definitely recommend the prime rib burrito.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-smithfield,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004
9,M M.,"Greensboro, NC",0,20,1.0,5.0,2016-12-29,I had drinks and dinner at the bar with Cassandra.  I could see a touch of the kitchen where David the manager was conducting the work flow like a maestro.  I like the food and staff here very much.  I can also recommend as a starter: Grilled asparagus - fresh and cooked to perfection.  Excellent job everyone!

Service is always good and we like there meal deals. Tonight we there for an early dinner we did the 2 for $22 we started with the chips and salsa with guacamole the chips where greases over salted the salsa is hit or miss depending on who's working that day and makes it. For dinner the wife order the sirloin medium rare mashed potatoes and broccoli with a side of shrimp which came out southwest style not what she wanted. I ordered the firer pepper chicken crisper so am so glade I ordered the sauce on the side talk about some heat it was good came with a side of French fries and corn on the cob. The fries were hot but not done to my liking and the corn which I never eat anyways because they over season and all I taste is salt. Our waitress was great we were just happy the food came out hot considering it was early so the place wasn't jamming. Like said about the salsa it all depends on who's working that day.

You would think if you frequent the place and the bartender says hey, would you like chips & salsa and you say yes that you won't be charged $4.19 for them since you never, ever had to pay for them EVER.
