48,T D.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,11,,1.0,2014-07-20,"I went to have a Sunday lunch/dinner at this Chili's . First, no one approached my table for 10 minutes.  I had a server approach us ( Megan). I am a frequent customer of Chili's and signed up for email. I received several codes for free appetizers and desserts. However, every time I have gone to a Chili's and dine, I would forget to bring the code, and they expired.  I went on this day and informed the server, Megan, what happened about the codes and asked if I could still use them. She got nasty with me, said, ""You can't have both!"" She didn't even let me finish my sentence saying, ""You telling you you are trying to use expired codes!"" She then said, ""As far as I know, you could have wrote any numbers down!""  She said this in a nasty tone. I told her that I was leaving, and I asked for a manager. She whispered something to the manager about me; the manager then walked in the back kitchen and never came out to speak with me.  We left .  Do not go here, go to a different Chili's",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-snellville-2?start=40,2.308,2.308,2.308,2.308,2.308
38,Paul C.,"Lawrenceville, GA",0,16,1.0,4.0,2014-07-21,"Let me say this, if I was giving this review a year ago it would be two stars.  But after taking a year off, we decided to go back and see if things have changed, and I am happy to say, they have. We have been there four times in the past two months so here goes: Service: I have yet to get a waiter/waitress that we haven't liked. Not pushy but always considerate.  Drinks: LOVE the variety of their marguerites, and they are great too.  Food: mixed reviews depending on what you order. I LOVE their hamburgers with yummy fries and their classic nachos with steak or chicken or both. You can't go wrong with either entree any time any day. Now, where you might not get maximum pleasure is their sirloin steak.  I never order steak here but my wife has and complains either about the flavor or the toughness.  Honestly, for under $12 you get a 6 ounce sirloin plus steamed broccoli and loaded mash potatoes. Maybe in this instance the old adage is correct- you get what you paid for. Or maybe the next steak might be better. (Shrugs shoulders). Sorry I can't review their famous ribs- I don't eat porky pig.  Management: Fantastic! My 90 year-old mother in-law ordered a hamburger medium- rare, but got it medium- well. She did not want to take it back because she didn't want to wait, so she ate it rather grudgingly.  But when I mentioned this to the manager, he gave her a coupon for one free meal. Nice touch. (Who orders hamburgers rare anyhow?)  Oh, did I mention how easy it is now to order and pay your bill?  Love it.  So, when you are done and in a hurry to leave, no waiter, no problem. It's right there on your table.  Shalom, Paul",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-snellville-2?start=20,2.7039999999999997,2.7039999999999997,2.7039999999999997,2.7039999999999997,2.7039999999999997

27,Stephen S.,"Snellville, GA",64,29,3.0,5.0,2015-07-25,"Out of all the local Chili's restaurants, this is the best in terms of food and service. Occasionally they'll have an off night, but it's fairly rare. This is also one of the better casual-food restaurants in the Snellville area.  Burgers are typically hot and fresh. The fries are really good (if they're not hot, I ask for fresh ones and they don't give me a hard time). The new pickles they introduced a few months ago, along with several new BBQ sauces, make for a great burger. I always ask for the sweet and spicy burger, no tomato, add jalapeño, extra BBQ sauce, and I've never been disappointed. (Tip: Eat the burger upside down and it will hold together better. Also ask for extra napkins!) My wife typically gets the Triple Dippers combo and always enjoys it (usually the little burgers and Southwestern Egg Rolls). She always gets two meals out of it.  Oldest kid gets the chipotle-style chicken fingers, which have an amazing sauce and taste great when they're fresh. They reheat pretty well too.  Youngest kid typically gets grilled chicken on the kids meal. They have some really healthy options for the kids.  Great service, great food--this location can't be beat!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-snellville-2?start=20,2.836,2.836,2.836,2.836,2.8360000000000003

I tried one bite & could determine the cake was MICROWAVED....BADLY! It was so dry that I couldn't enjoy it. When I told my server she said yeah that's why people get the ice cream.

It's as though some days they're amazing, and then other days we promise never to go back again. The most recent time we went was for my birthday and we had a table of 10 people with us. Our server messed up half of our drinks, served two plates of food, made us wait 10 minutes for the other 4 plates to come out, and another 10 minutes for the remainder of the food to come out. By the time one part of our group was done eating (we told them to eat so it wouldn't get cold), we would just be getting served our food. Some of the food came out burnt, while other food came out pink (my mother in laws chicken for example). We were really disappointed although the server apologized numerous times, it wasn't the service we were having issues with. The food was the thing that has always been the breaking point whenever we went back. Whenever I would order the sliders I would ask for NO BACON, when the food arrives...there's bacon on the burgers (religious reasons as to why I can't eat bacon otherwise it wouldn't be an issue). If my husband would order wings they would come out and they wouldn't be cooked well, or there was a hair on them once, or they were still cold.

The waitress agreed it looked gross and took it back to the kitchen. After a little bit she came back and said ""that's how the broccoli comes.""  Uhhh....you mean spoiled? It comes spoiled? She agreed it was weird and offered to switch it out for another side. I decided to get more rice and they brought out this little cup that wasn't even full and the rice was undercooked. I go to the ziosk to pay the bill and they had the nerve to charge me for a handful of undercooked rice.  The manager did go above and beyond in fixing the issue, but if the kitchen can't tell when broccoli is spoiled, I fear for their ability to do anything else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-snellville-2,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88
5,Roger H.,"Lilburn, GA",179,19,10.0,5.0,2017-10-21,"Lunch with the family for wife's birthday. Had a great time. Great atmosphere, great service. Daughter loved playing on the tablet.

4,Charity M.,"Columbus, GA",7,8,6.0,5.0,2017-10-27,Nachos are amazing  (and I order nachos everywhere) and the margaritas are yummy. Hubby had fried pickles and wings. Everything was great. We will be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-snellville-2,3.08,3.08,3.08,,3.0800000000000005
3,William B.,"Alpharetta, GA",20,3,1.0,1.0,2017-12-02,Ordered the sliders and this is how they came out.. Also never brought out my mashed potatoes after asking them twice about it. Manager comped the burgers but still charged for the drink.. Won't be back here again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-snellville-2,3.08,3.08,3.08,,3.0800000000000005
8,Karen L.,"Norcross, GA",0,14,1.0,5.0,2017-12-15,My husband and I have been to this location many times and we always sit at the bar. The bartenders provide excellent service and attention. I had the black bean fajitas which was delicious and worth the price. We will definitely be coming back soon.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-snellville-2,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006
2,Alex I.,"Orlando, FL",94,7,3.0,1.0,2017-12-30,I have came here several times after work for a beer and a bite the service is usually great which is why it pained me LITERALLY to write this review. I came inside and needed to use the men's room prior to being seated as I walked inside i immediately slipped into a large puddle of liquid. I came out and informed the waitress who while apologized did not try to reach out to a manager to even have some sort of report written which I would have assumed be standard. I'm relatively young and in good health but had it been an elderly person they could have broken a hip or worse. After gathering myself and clearly no one caring to check on me I left limping to my car nothing was broken but still disappointed. I will be reaching out to corporate.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-snellville-2,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005
0,Jones H.,"Stone Mountain, GA",54,89,460.0,4.0,2018-01-05,"This is one of those places where you really can't go wrong. The food is always delicious. This location had a nice crowd and a wonderful atmosphere. We ordered the two for $35. meal deal where you share an appetizer, get two entrees and share a dessert, oh and get two Margaritas. My friend and I ordered the Strawberry Mango           margarita which was delicious with a pleasing amount of alcohol within it. I love the way the two servers came over to the table, shook and poured or drinks for us with a smile. I ordered bacon chicken quesadillas, they were delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-snellville-2,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005
