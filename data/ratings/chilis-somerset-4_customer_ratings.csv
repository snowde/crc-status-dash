33,Michael B.,"Somerset, MA",0,3,,1.0,2013-03-30,"I have been several times in which I ate at the bar and was somewhat pleased..I took my 6 and 4 year old today for dinner at 4:45 (early and wasn't really busy). The service was so slow, in total dinner took 1 3/4 hours (doesn't work well with young kids).  The meals were delivered by the manager and as he was putting my ribs down on the table, my meal fell off the plate. He was apologetic and got me new ribs...took an additional twenty minutes, by the time they reached the table my kids were done with their over cooked mediocre cheese burgers. I had to rush to eat. Finally the bill came over, I was thinking that the manager would comp my ribs...well I was charged for 2 rib meals and they comped 1 rib meal..still had to pay for my ribs..terrible customer service and I will never be going back..the people and food suck.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-somerset-4?start=20,1.988,1.988,1.988,1.988,1.988
30,Kyle F.,"Fall River, MA",14,25,11.0,2.0,2013-09-15,"Disappointed in the Menu changes. I used to love the Chicken Club Tacos, but they're no longer on the menu. I went with the closest to them I could find. The Crispy Chicken Tacos. What a let down. Small pieces of chicken. Most of it being batter. No bueno!

23,Ashley E.,"Longview, TX",3,52,13.0,4.0,2014-06-30,"I'm not sure why this place has a rating of 2.5 stars... Scanning the reviews, it looks like most people have an issue with the service. I could see that; our waiters (we had 2 that were working together) did kind of disappear at strange times, even though one of them told us, when we remarked upon the place being fairly busy, that they considered that time to be ""slow."" On the flip side, they pretty much nailed the food. The only issue we had was that a couple of the small burgers (sliders) were not cooked well enough. Like, the entire thing was pink. Drinks were quick enough, food was brought out quickly enough, and we didn't have to wait for our check. It also wasn't presented too early.  I think this location is pretty good. I just wouldn't recommend it during really busy times... I think the service would probably suffer based on what we experience during ""slow times.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-somerset-4?start=20,2.448,2.448,2.448,2.448,2.4480000000000004
27,Chris R.,"Somerset, MA",5,30,20.0,4.0,2015-02-15,Chili's in Somerset gets a solid 4 stars. You cant expect much more from a chain restaurant. While they don't serve craft cocktails their margarita's are more than passable. food and service are consistently above average. My son enjoys the tablet kiosks at the table and plays a few games while waiting for his meal. Good family spot.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-somerset-4?start=20,2.352,2.352,2.352,2.352,2.352
17,Jessica V.,"Fall River, MA",20,58,76.0,4.0,2015-02-25,"I used to go to Chili's in Somerset all the time a few years ago, but now my visits are less frequent. But overall, if you are looking for a decent chain restaurant this is one of the good ones.  I went with a group of friends on a Saturday night to celebrate National Margarita Day. There was a 25 minute wait which went by quicker than that, and we were waited on immediately. Our waiter, TJ, was fantastic. We never had empty drinks or empty chips & salsa. Most of us just snacked on the chips, but my sisters boyfriend has a chicken bacon ranch quesadilla which came out pretty quickly, and he enjoyed. Overall if you want a decent chain experience Chili's in Somerset is the place to go. Fantastic staff, and great margaritas. My personal recommendations it the Blackberry Presidente!  This is a great place to hang out with friends, have a few drinks, and enjoy the night!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-somerset-4,2.384,2.384,2.384,2.384,2.384

20,Sarah B.,"Somerset, MA",2,31,42.0,3.0,2015-04-03,"Fast service, huge selection and tasty food. The location in Somerset has just remodeled inside. The menu has changed a bit too, but still offers favorites such as Their Steak & Chicken Fajitas, Big mouth Burgers, Ribs and Cajun Chicken Pasta.  There is a lighter selection available now along with a new Tex-Mex section. For a chain restaurant Chilis really hits the spot. Mostly every-time we are there the food is good, a little salty sometimes, but still worth a try. Just don't touch that stupid kiosk thing they put on your table..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-somerset-4?start=20,,,,,

Funny thing though. A friend and I ordered fajitas and were told they were out of peppers, a main part of the fajita. Would be understandable , except that they are located in the same plaza as a stop and shop supermarket (yes they were open)! I seriously wanted to give them a dollar to go get a pepper.

19,Guido S.,"Swansea, MA",4,31,3.0,1.0,2015-12-31,"Ok so my family goes in 5 deep 3 kids on a Tuesday night at 730. I used to be a regular. Now we ordered a quesadilla a pizza and a grilled cheese. My wife ordered a salad an I ordered some lite chicken dish.  We sat there for an hour before our food came out. When it did come out the quesadilla was burnt and cold the pizza was cold with congealed cheese. The grilled cheese was mushy and my chicken was luke warm. We didn't send it back because. we were starving. So half of the meals were cleared with half eaten or non eaten plates.  My son who ate the pizza preceded to wake up and vomit that night. The fastest part of the meal was ""shannon"" rushing to get out check. She left us after dropping off our food to never be seen again.

Forgot a side and skimped on portions. 3 chicken tenders and half a bowl of mac and cheese and everything is cold. Can't believe this is happening twice.

5,Mallory R.,"Fall River, MA",136,112,150.0,4.0,2016-09-20,"For a chain, this Chilis is pretty good. I've been here a few times, and have always received excellent service.  The waiter or waitress we've had, are always nice, on top of everything, including refills and just overall great. I think this is one of the top reasons we've come back here. Great service is always a plus!  They have always been very accommodating to my food allergies.  No guff, and always great on suggesting some foods or drinks for me to try! My personal favorite meal are the fresh mex bowls. Fresh veggies that taste fresh and yummy.  I don't have any negative things really about this. I rated this restaurant only 4 stars because they are a chain, and the food obviously isn't top notch. It's a great place to go if you're in the area, or if you don't feel like cooking that night!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-somerset-4,,,,,
10,Taryn L.,"New Bedford, MA",0,4,,1.0,2016-12-02,"The only good thing about this dining experience was the waitress.  We waited about 30 minutes for a table and the hostess was very unfriendly. The burger was completely over cooked and dry, the fries were dry and stale like you reheated old potatoes, and the bun was hard as a rock.  To top it off, the Ziosk charged us $1.99 for a trivia game, which we did not accept to pay what so ever. A nearby waitress overheard our debacle and started ARGUING with me about the fact that ""she's been here 11 years"" and she knows it warns you of the charges beforehand. It did not.  Chili's has completely gone downhill and I will never return to this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-somerset-4,,,,,
12,Dave F.,"Cranston, RI",28,100,2.0,1.0,2016-12-08,"Incredibly unpleasant experience for takeout. Ordered food at 6:38... had somewhere to be at 7:00. Now. I KNEW I was cutting it too close and was going to be late, but I was told 20 minutes and it's only 5 minutes from my final destination... perfect! Only 4-5 minutes late, lifesavers. About 5-7 minutes after my food was supposed to be out, the very pleasant hostess informed me that she was just waiting on the sides for fajitas. After standing there until 7:14 for my meals (another 7-8 minutes), while ""enjoying"" the sounds of the chef screaming/swearing about clean plates and the gentleman purposely changing kegs so loudly it actually startled me twice (I know it to be on purpose as he later kicked the empty over) I asked for my food despite the sides, which I found or was simply cheese, salsa and guac... the hostess (who once again was great) apologized as ""she asked him several times for it"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-somerset-4,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52

Only one of the five meals was OK...chicken tenders. Other four died under the heat lamp. My sandwich was a real treat. Wilted lettuce, white tomato, one tiny half slice of avocado on one half. Two pieces of bacon on the other half. Roll hard yet plate too hot to touch. Death by Heat lamp. Each half sandwich had half just bread, the other half little rubber chicken. I don't expect much from Chilis, we were just looking for a quick bite after hockey, but wow.

11,M. D.,"Lakeville, MA",3,16,,1.0,2017-02-27,"After trying this location multiple times, I have vowed to ONLY eat at the Raynham location. I have NEVER had a good meal here since moving to the area. The last time I ate here, we ordered take-out and I had ordered the burger sliders. When we got back to my house, I opened my box to find the burgers were BURNT, they had NONE of the toppings advertised on the menu, and one of them was missing the bottom bun! How does a cook make those mistakes? My only explanation is they were too lazy to fix their mistakes and just gave me a meal that wasn't even edible to save themselves time. I finally convinced my friends that I refuse to eat here anymore, but before we stopped going, we used to go out for girls' nights to get margaritas, which also sucked. They tasted like 100% mixer and no tequila. You don't even get a buzz, and I'll admit I'm a lightweight when I drink. For me to drink an entire margarita and not be phased by it means we got jipped, plain and simple. Whenever I've requested a refund from the managers here, they say the register has already been cleared out but they'll give me Chili's vouchers instead. I don't want vouchers to your crappy restaurant! I worked in food service too - you should NEVER close out the register until all the guests have left and the restaurant is officially closed! All in all, DON'T GO HERE. Make the extra drive to go to another location, or hop over the bridge to Fall River to support the small businesses there for dinner. You'll get much better food and much better service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-somerset-4,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
9,Holly P.,"Fall River, MA",1,39,6.0,2.0,2017-04-10,"I personally don't like the ziosks. The kids fight over it and it reduces family time. Yes, I could just say no to the games, but to be a kid and have that teaser in front of you just to have your mom say ""no"" is crappy. I'd rather go to a place where I don't have to play the bad guy just so I can interact with my family. The food is mediocre. I had the salmon a couple times and both times it was over cooked and the rice was hard like it had been sitting out for a long time. However, I like the spinach queso dip.

We had our choices already picked out but none of that would work for Chili's.  Their disrespect and lack of caring means that we will never go back.  On our drive home I heard my kids keep saying ""worst birthday ever"".  The look on my wife's face was defeating.  Melts my heart and all because of Chili's lack of service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-somerset-4,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
