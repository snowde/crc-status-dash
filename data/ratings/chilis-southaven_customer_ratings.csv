18,Todd T.,"Atlanta, GA",12,31,42.0,2.0,2012-10-12,"First, I expect the food at a chain to have a consistency. The salsa had a very strange taste. Something I couldn't figure out. When I received my fajitas, I honestly thought it was a lunch portion. The only reason I was sure it was a dinner portion was the time of night I was eating and the huge mound of onions. Not bell pepper and onions. The meat was seriously a small portion and was disappointing. The server was very nice. She did a good job till she brought me another tables bill by mistake. Those things happen. Anyway, I would recommend this location kick it up a notch or three.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southaven,2.088,2.088,2.088,2.088,2.088
27,Kimberly S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,22,1.0,1.0,2013-02-02,"This place has the worst customer service I encountered on my trip to Memphis this year. I stayed in MS this year when I went to the 35th Elvis week back in August. Let me just tell you this was the worst customer service I encountered in the South. Food was sub par too. Our waitress was rude and acted like every time we asked for something it bothered her. There was only about 10 people total in the whole place, this alone should have been a red flag since our visit was on a Friday night. A Friday night should be busy for this kinda place, but after all I witnessed I'm not surprised it was empty. All the servers sat at the bar and talked. You would think they could keep busy, maybe clean the bathroom? When I used the bathroom it was filthy. Several times our party needed drinks filled, but instead of our waitress helping us, she was talking to all the other staff who also had nothing to do at the bar. Seemed like the bar was the servers big hangout. Next time I go to Memphis I wont go here again, and I encourage anyone reading this to run as fast as you can and go somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southaven?start=20,2.084,2.084,2.084,2.084,2.0840000000000005

9,Krystal E.,"Southaven, MS",63,112,318.0,1.0,2013-08-14,"Never Again!  I ordered the Santa Fe Chicken Salad. I returned iceburg lettuce & reheated chicken for iceburg lettuce, reheated chicken, a couple avocado wedges, & some cold black beans. I returned it a 2nd time for a refund!!! It was the worst salad I've ever seen for $10. I remember when I liked Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southaven,,,,,
28,Michael T.,"Charleston, SC",103,617,5.0,2.0,2013-08-25,Fast food for the business traveler.  Wait staff were very friendly and attentive.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southaven?start=20,,,,,
26,Kenneth S.,"Southaven, MS",2,8,27.0,5.0,2014-03-22,"Went around 7:00 on Saturday Night. We had two server's, Jason was in training and Amber. For being new Jason did a great job and Amber was fantastic and she has a wonder smile which I saw several times. I had the chicken fried steak with corn on the cob and skin in mashed potatoes. And my wife ordered something that was not on the menu anymore and they still cooked it for her. Tortilla chips and salsa for appetizers. Everything was delicious!!!! The corn on the cob was hot and buttery. I also like very much the kiosk with video that is on every table. You can order more adult beverages and desserts on the touch screen. And you can pay and tip right on the kiosk and swipe your card on it. I think that is great, this is the first restaurant I've seen with this system. I never did like handing my debit card to a stranger. Great service, food and restaurant. Will return soon, maybe I'll spot Ambers wonderful smile again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southaven?start=20,,,,,
10,Sarah S.,"Cypress, TX",0,15,1.0,1.0,2014-11-28,"Unbelievable, the service here sucked so bad for the first time EVER I didn't even leave a TIP. It took our waitress 10 minutes to even ask us what we would like to drink. Our food was good but took for ever to get condiments.  The restaurant was a disaster, no one wanted to clean off tables or even the bar. I will never eat at this chili's again. It truly is a shit hole. I am putting all the blame on the managements lack of knowledge in how to run a restaurant and utilize a team of people.I saw the manager several times not helping her servers and just standing around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southaven,,,,,
21,Sue W.,"Hernando, MS",0,18,,1.0,2014-11-30,So bad hostess acted liked she did not care. Server was fast to get drinks then it stop 55 minutes for a burger.

20,Christina N.,"Memphis, TN",29,299,87.0,3.0,2014-12-28,"This location is a typical Chili's - clean and predictable.  Staff was friendly and the food was good.  The quality did not deviate from what I expected of Chili's (score for being consistent Chili's!).  Two things I didn't love about this visit (and why I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 4), is that the garlic pickles that come with burgers have WAY too much garlic.  It would be nice if they offered seasoned or unseasoned pickles.  I want pickles with my burger but don't want to commit to a week of garlic breath.  The other low point of my visit was my bartender. While SUPER friendly - he was too friendly.  Instead of feeling like he was there to tend to me (the customer), I felt as though I was there to entertain him.  He continually talked to me, despite my b*tch face and insisted on showing me videos on youtube and pictures of his family.  Maybe I'm a terrible person, but I was hungover and on a mission to Christmas shop.  I wanted to be left alone to strategize and this bartender was not take my nonverbal cues to leave me alone, which really made the visit very stressful.  It would be good if Chili's just reminded staff that their friendliness and chattiness should, on some level, be reflective of that given by the customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southaven?start=20,,,,,
22,Toni B.,"Southaven, MS",0,1,,1.0,2015-01-22,"My husband and I went for lunch today. We sat for 10 minutes before a waitress stopped and asked us if our waitress had come by yet. She took our drink order. Water that had a horrible after taste. We both ordered burgers. Mine came with a house salad. It tasted like it had been sitting in the cooler for days. Uncovered. The burgers came out and they would have been ok had the lettuce and tomato not been so horrible. Our waitress stayed in the back the whole time and only checked on us once. We had to stop the waitress who took our drink order just to get some ketchup. All in all the best part of the meal was the fries. We won't be back and we are glad we used a gift card instead of wasting our money. We always tip, but we felt as though the other waitress deserved it more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southaven?start=20,,,,,
15,Shaneice R.,"Winona, MS",2,1,,1.0,2015-04-11,"Never again! We had to wait about 30 to 40 minutes to get our food, when we did some of us had cold food and didn't eat it..... So we had to get our money back!  but the appetizer was good, Texas cheese fries",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southaven,,,,,
11,Nikol B.,"Memphis, TN",6,2,,2.0,2015-05-10,Everyone's food was hot and good except my daughter's.  She had to send her plate back. Everyone else eat without her.  She got her food by the time we left.  Disappointed. ..This is Mother's day!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southaven,,,,,
12,Rachel A.,"Collierville, TN",5,35,18.0,3.0,2015-07-14,"We had to wait several minutes before the hostess even came over to talk to us. They were seriously short staffed. But Our triple appetizer was good and my husband's taco trio (one of each: fish, shrimp and beef) was good but the top shelf beef enchiladas were NOT! They were nothing but ooey, nasty fat. However the manager was very apologetic and made me a cheese quesadilla (my request, which she did not charge for) and checked on us several more times. So they get a 'C' for food quality and a 'B' for overall service, but the manager gets an 'A'. Any facility will have issues and knowing how to handle them definitely counts for something!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southaven,,,,,
14,Lynn C.,"Southaven, MS",0,3,,2.0,2015-07-15,Ordered take out.  The chicken tenders were under cooked and the cheese bites should be removed from the menu - nothing but batter.  Slow service. Plenty of girls standing around giggling but wouldn't make eye contact to tell me someone would be with me.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southaven,,,,,
13,Christopher H.,"Orange Park, FL",23,5,,1.0,2015-10-15,Just an awful place. Service is God awful. Food is mediocre at best. We had a party of 8 all paying separate because of work and we needed or cards ran separately wss disgusted that we asked her to do it. This is one of the few restaurants where they don't work for tips. Chips tasted like you were licking the side of a salt block. Salad was not fresh at all maybe a week ago fresh. Just awful don't eat here there are better places around.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southaven,,,,,
5,Nick W.,"Memphis, TN",157,89,49.0,3.0,2015-12-27,"This Chili's has been up and down for quite a while now. I used to REALLY love coming here, and I still do enjoy it, just not as much as I did a few years ago. I feel like it's an atmosphere issue- it hasn't been very clean the past few times (almost slipped and fell due to slick floors), and none of the staff seemed happy to be there, which I think translated into unhappy patrons.  I still enjoyed the food the past few times, for the most part. My go-to item is the honey chipotle chicken crispers. The sauce is absolutely amazing. Over the years, the portions on the chicken have gotten slimmer, but still decent for the price. This most recent time, my broccoli was covered in salt in pepper, which I strongly dislike, but hey, I lived.  I ordered the two-for-one margaritas, also, which was a bad idea. Unless you are Buddy the Elf and like drinking pure sugar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southaven,,,,,
17,James N.,"Lonoke, AR",0,8,,2.0,2016-03-08,"Seriously understaffed for a busy lunch. Our appetizer got to the table after the main meal. (WTF?) Waitress, I think Sandra, was great but couldn't find unsweet tea because new employees weren't putting it in right pitcher??? Come on. I quit going to Applebees's, is Chilis next?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southaven,,,,,
7,Cameron C.,"Cordova, TN",1,3,1.0,1.0,2016-03-21,"I would not waste my time here. There are many better places in the area. For one, the service is very slow and food is mediocre. The hostess staff works at a snails pace. The wait staff is unexciting, and not on top of their game: not only did I have to ask for refills, but I had a thirty minute period of not even seeing my waiter because he was trying to acquire my burger....that took an hour to prepare. By the way, don't bother asking for a manager, because half of them seem to have better things to do, like lean against the wall and flirt with the wait staff. (I even have a lovely picture of this) So here is a big thank you to Chili's Southhaven, for wasting an hour and a half of my time for a mediocre bacon cheeseburger. (The restaurant was half full, and it was 20 minutes after the rest of my table received their food before I got up and attempted to talk to said manager, who blew me off. Eventually another manager came out and spoke with me, but this was after I paid my tab) I asked the female manager to have the General Manager call and follow up with me before I wrote this, but like I expected, their customer service failed again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southaven,,,,,

16,Tasha J.,"Tunica Resorts, MS",43,3,3.0,1.0,2016-06-20,"I ordered a ribeye medium well. The steak was over cooked and not satisfying to me. I sent the steak back by my waiter and asked for the steak to be prepared medium well. The waiter returned to the table with the same plate and stated the cook (Jim) told her to bring me the steak back and that the steak was cooked medium well . Jim told my waiter that he would be out later to talk to me. I asked to speak with the floor manager. When the floor manager came to the table he never greeted anyone at our table nor did he give us his name. He approached the table and stated ""yes someone need me."" I stated to him what happened and that I need corporate number and the gentleman's name that sent the well done steak back to the table. I had to ask the floor manager for his information and he only stated Dave. No one seemed to care that my food was not prepared correctly. The only apology I got was from our waiter Tierra. This is poor customer service and this trip asked ruined my moms birthday. I will never return to this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southaven,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92

She was friendly and made little jokes and that's very important to make costumers feel welcome. The food tonight was pretty much perfect. The burger was juicy, the bun soft, and condiments were fresh. The chicken quesadilla was crunchy and definitely not stingy with the chicken.
