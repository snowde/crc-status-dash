21,George K.,"Southington, CT",14,83,,3.0,2012-07-08,"I completely agree with the two reviews placed. Chili's in Southington is strictly average. They don't do a lot to screw up your food. The service is generally pretty reliable. Once in a while you have an inattentive server. But it really doesn't stand out. It's just a Chili's. Does a decent business, but there's no big draw to it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southington?start=20,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998
24,Nicholas W.,"West Hartford, CT",0,14,,1.0,2012-10-21,Went to pick up food there to take home and you know how you can  Sit in your car and they will bring it out to you.  NOPES.  Wait 10mins in my car and then went inside waited another fives my food wasn't even ready from the time the girl gave us.  It wasn't even busy.  I could see the workers joke around in the work area.  I haven't gone back since,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southington?start=20,,,,,
22,Bill A.,"Boston, MA",6,62,5.0,1.0,2013-04-15,Chili's is Chili's - the food is consistent; you know what you will get.  This review is for the service.  Sunday evening - not even completely full - struggled to get a beer - overwhelmed wait staff.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southington?start=20,,,,,
16,Jason S.,"Southington, CT",162,362,255.0,2.0,2014-01-30,We ate at the bar. Granted we arrived only about 40 minutes prior to closing time but we just ordered some simple happy hour appetizers on this particular Sunday evening. The burger bites were dry tasting and uninspiring. Not juicy and scrumptious as I had hoped they would be. I know it's a Chili's but I have had the same meal at other locations and it was significantly better.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southington,,,,,
15,Robert S.,"Bristol, CT",7,17,47.0,2.0,2014-03-16,"Obviously it is nothing special, just your typical chain restaurant.  I have been to this particular location a few times now, and every time it has just been average if anything.  The atmosphere is that of a chain restaurant, the staff friendliness varies, and the food is either bad or acceptable. The most recent time my girlfriend and I went we ordered the bottomless tostada chips & salsa.  The chips were very salty, and the salsa was essentially red water with chunks in it.  We were both starving so we powered through them. I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich, and my girlfriend had the chicken caesar salad.  You can't really mess either of those entrees up, and they were both fine as a meal.  The fries that came with my meal were, like the chips, very salty.  The chicken was a little dry as well, and there wasn't enough buffalo sauce on it. Could have been better, could have been worse, but hey, we were hungry and it was food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southington,,,,,
12,Dana S.,"Philadelphia, PA",54,247,30.0,3.0,2014-04-20,"It was pretty standard for a Chili's.  We were in the area for a wedding and needed a quick lunch.  It did the job.  Place is a little dated but staff was friendly and took good care of us.  We sat in the ""lounge"" or bar area, so not sure if service there differs from the restuarant part.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southington,,,,,
19,Adam C.,"Southington, CT",2,1,,2.0,2014-05-21,"Never order Togo, they will always screw up the order, it is very rare that they will pay attention to what you asked to be removed or added.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southington,,,,,
23,Raven S.,"Meriden, CT",0,1,,1.0,2014-12-30,"I normally do not do this but I have to because when you go to Chills in Southington I don't want people to be blindsided as I was. When I first entered Chillis the hostess/seater was talking with her friend/coworkers she saw us a few minutes later and walked us to our table. We noticed something on the table and started to ask her questions but she stopped us immediately and told us our waitress will explain everything to us. The way she addressed us was in a manor as though she had better things to do and as if we were wasting her time. She just stormed off. I thought ok and just sat down thinking it didn't matter. Little did I know. Our waitress came over a few minutes later. Her name was Cassandra. At first she was nice but then things went down hill. I asked for a glass of wine to start and my sisters asked for their beverages and they order appetizers. She left came back along while later with our drinks and gave me a glass of water I didn't ask for and looked at me with complete judgement. I thought wtf! I had no idea why she looked at me that way. She was rude she never stopped at our table only at the tables around us. She had our table and two others. We had to catch her when she was leaving one of the two tables. I asked her for another glass of wine along while later and she kept walking and at the same time shouted across the restaurant that she is going to wait until I finish the first glass, which was finished. Cassandra and The seater  were so rude and so disrespectful that I will never go to Chillis in Southington, Ct. again! To be judged and disrespected is not an experience I want to repeat. Alot more happened but I think I said enough. I have no idea why this experience happened to me. I just thought people should know.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southington?start=20,,,,,
0,Linda C.,"Hartford, CT",161,202,33.0,4.0,2015-02-01,"I went here with a friend on Saturday night because I wanted a burger and I didn't want to eat at a bar. We went to Chili's, mostly because they had $5.00 margaritas, and sat down at one of those regular tables.  I ordered the smoke and sweet burger and my friend ordered an enchilada. My burger was pretty  good and the service was great. I don't remember her name, but she came by to check on us a few times.  The only con is that the place has high ceilings, so it was a bit drafty at the place. Other than that, I didn't really see any cons. It's a standard chain restaurant, but this one was a bit better than the ""standard"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southington,,,,,

13,Desiree D.,"New Haven, CT",172,421,581.0,2.0,2015-03-11,"Meh...... so I hate the one in Wallingford (see review) but the hubby was hungry and wanted a burger, but then got ribs.  Anyways,  we were greeted nicely at the door and immediately seated. We were out in the back right corner near the take away area. We sat.... and sat...... and sat some more 10 or so minutes,  until the waiter noticed us.  He finally comes and says sorry,  he didn't see us.  Idk how,  since he walked by us 2 times to take payment from another table.  Anyways,  we order all at once and he says he will be back with our drinks,  but never shows.  Then he brings our app ( do NOT get the guac, the portion is ridiculous for $5.99) and still no drinks,  then exclaims oooops, I poured them but forgot them. .... OK. ... no worries.  Then we get our food,  which I have to say was very good,  and he never checks back with us.  I guess I'm a magnet for poor service.  I would go back,  he might have just been overwhelmed and this experience is not great but since the good is good,  I'd try again.  Always look for coupons online,  as you can now pay and scan them right at the table using those little tablets",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southington,,,,,
14,Trish G.,"Southington, CT",0,3,,5.0,2015-07-08,"I had the pleasure of eating dinner at this Chili's June 26th and wanted to thank all for a wonderful experience. When my aunt and I entered the restaurant, we were greeted by a very friendly hostess who, without hesitation, accommodated a special request for a specific table. We were then greeted by a server, Yasmine (I hope I have the spelling right) and she was wonderful. She was friendly, very capable, and even though the restaurant was getting busy, she never rushed us. She anticipated our requests before we even had to ask. Outstanding job, Yasmine!! The food was delicious. We had Margherita Flatbread appetizers that were excellent. And we had turkey sandwiches on a special toast that was probably the best I've ever tasted.  We also met and spoke with Sarah and Telly (again I hope I have your names right, apologies if I don't) who came around to make sure our dining experience was a good one. They were great to us, listening to what we had to say and taking time to talk with us. All around you all made our experience at Chili's very special. We thank you and look forward to seeing you again soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southington,,,,,
18,Allison G.,"Plantsville, CT",43,4,,4.0,2015-08-24,"Chili's is always consistent and great for a delicious margarita accompanied with a burger or Mexican plate. We once had an issue with a kid's meal, and the owner was so attentive and comped that meal, as well as gave us a coupon for a free kid's meal during our next visit. ABOVE and BEYOND to make sure we were happy upon leaving. Very grateful for many great experiences here. The desserts are sub-par, or else I would give a 5-star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southington,,,,,
20,Patrick M.,"Plantsville, CT",0,3,,1.0,2015-09-04,"My family went to eat dinner around 5:45 pm on 9/4/2015 at the Southington CT location and were served 3 blue/rare steaks in a row after originally requesting the 6 oz steak be cooked medium-rare. The third steak we had returned to the kitchen to be reheated to medium rare and that was served as the final meal, no fourth attempt. The manager stated ""Three strikes and your out, so it's our fault"" but it shouldn't take a novice chef more than one try to cook a steak. We were comped the Steak dinner but our other two meals were payed for even though a member of our family had to sit through the entire meal with no food. We were also allowed to take home the second steak to ""cook ourselves"". Multiple times the manager asked if we would like to cook these steaks ourselves, implying that we were being stingy about requesting a new item. If we were given a proper answer as to why these steaks were uncooked multiple times then we would have given a monetary tip to the waitress but we were greeted with lighthearted responses to try and ease the situation. Some people would have blown up but we remained calm and falsely reassured the waitress and manger that this event was fine. We were offered a free desert but declined the offer and were given two $5 dollar vouchers. After a couple issues over different years at this location (assuming different managers) I have sworn off returning to this establishment and will strongly recommend to all fellow friends family and neighbors that this place will never improve upon their lackluster service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southington?start=20,,,,,
7,G R.,"Anaheim, CA",6,44,23.0,2.0,2015-10-06,"I truly hate writing bad reviews, but had to share my experience at Chili's last night. I sat at the bar...Taylor was my waitress/bartender. Took her a minute to acknowledge me, albeit she was in the middle of supervising a keg change. Still, the wait for a hello, can I get you anything took a minute. So much so that the gentleman who's seat I'd inadvertently taken make a comment about the same thing, which made me feel as if I wasn't totally out of place.  Ordered nachos and 3 beef enchiladas. Food took forever to come out. Nachos came out first and had been nuked...enchiladas came out later. I'd eaten half of the order and decided to take the rest to go. After finally getting Taylor to make eye contact again (seemed way to busy servicing other customers), I asked for the check and noted I wanted to take the rest back to my hotel. She brought a Styrofoam container out and handed it to me. Now, I personally hate it when restaurants make you put your own food away. And why wouldn't you bring out a bag and utensils along with the container? All in all, a sloppy experience. Not to totally crap on the bartender...she seemed nice....but overall service and quality of food was lacking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southington,,,,,
11,Ray B.,"Bristol, CT",1,77,,2.0,2015-11-27,Place and quality have fallen far. Needs a remodel badly. Staff has always been decent. Take out is steady and usually on time. It's really just chilis like many other have gone away from using the better quality of meats replacing them with bottom of barrel meats. I loved Chilis in late 90s and early 2000s but man have they dropped off since. Also portions are significantly smaller. Fajitas back in day had red peppers now it's just limited green peppers. Also they give you 2-3 shells. What an absolute joke that is considering the steak and chicken is limited and very thin.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southington,,,,,
9,Joseph S.,"South Windsor, CT",53,23,1.0,1.0,2016-03-05,"Sad!! From the half drinks my girlfriend was getting because she asked for no lime juice in a Cosmo to cold dinner all around sucked. Server sweeping while we ate, and to top it off the stupid little tablet they have at the table they charge you for. Check your bill and keep your hands to yourself.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southington,,,,,
8,Kassi L.,"Hartford, CT",0,5,,1.0,2016-05-31,"I've never gone wrong at a Chili's before! I've eaten at PLENTY of Chili's.  This was a nightmare.  *it is important to note that I have worked in service before, so even while I was incredibly frustrated this whole time, I was extremely polite to the staff. It is easy to think that all of this could have happened because I had been rude to them, but I had done quite the opposite* I had just finished a long hard day and needed to eat, nothing much was open past 9 on a Wednesday, but Chili's was, so I figured I could get a fairly quick bite there. WAS I WRONG.  I started by waiting somewhere between 5 and 10 minutes before someone noticed I was standing at the podium at the front of the restaurant. It was 9 and they were open until 11 so it's not like I was the last person walking in for the night.  I tried to get the servers attention. Some of them actually looked right at me and continued to do other things. So I stood there until someone finally came to seat me. No apology for the wait. Then I was seated, and it took FIFTEEN MINUTES for a waiter to come over to me.  The place was busy but by no means full. And it took 15 minutes for someone to even come over and ask me what I wanted to drink. By that time I had obviously decided what I wanted to order.  I ordered a water, and my meal.  The waitress told me that she and the other waitress in the area were tag-teaming all of the tables. Which made it even more incredible that there were TWO of them and it still took 15 minutes to ask if I wanted water.... Ordering my water and food was the last I saw of them.  I watched a group of people get seated next to me in a timely manner. I watched them get served drinks and their food BEFORE I EVEN SAW MY WATER. I watched other tables order desserts, and refills of drinks, each time I thought that my water would be coming out with them. But they had truly just forgotten about me.  The other waitress frequently walked by and made eye contact with me. Saw I was sitting there with nothing in front of me. And quickly walked away before I could ask where my water was.  30 minutes later, 45 minutes after I had been seated and 55 minutes after I had entered the restaurant, I finally got a water and my food. It was average Chili's food.  THE WAITRESS DID NOT EVEN APOLOGIZE. She knew she took 45 minutes to get me a WATER. But she said nothing. It was a completely ridiculous experience and I now warn everyone I know in the area never to go to this particular chilis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southington,,,,,
6,Liz C.,"Southington, CT",41,3,,1.0,2016-08-28,"Save yourself the trouble and do not order To Go. The ribs were dry and tough, the peach cobbler was cold and my drink was only 2/3 full and watered down. A complete waste of $25!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southington,,,,,

5,Roseann B.,"New Britain, CT",0,10,,1.0,2016-10-29,"I don't know where to begin. We stopped there tonight and stood waiting with another couple who had been there a while,  for someone to notice us. Finally I went up to the staff to get someone to seat us. Waiter was nice. I happened to go to the restroom which was filthy and on route, noticed food all over the kitchen floor with some, I assume host or manger putting together a  chip and salsa bowl, no gloves on, with her hair hanging down, joking and kidding around in there.  Food, I'm not kidding here, all over the floor in the kitchen. The tables were visibly dirty. Meal was ok and like I said waiter was nice. What happened here?? Never had this experience in any Chili's before. Needless to say we won't be back. And from what I've read of other reviews I won't be the only one not returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southington,,,,,
4,Jackie B.,"Summerville, SC",6,121,41.0,5.0,2017-02-03,I left a previous one star review at this establishment because my boyfriend and I had an issue. Chili's reached out to me personally to rectify the situation and a manager that is local to me called me personally to resolve the issue.

3,Barney B.,"Rocky Hill, CT",0,10,,4.0,2017-06-28,"This is a great franchise of chilis. The food was delicious. I ordered the boneless wings which were both spicy and meaty. For my meal I ordered bacon ranch quesadillas which were absolutely scrumptious, except they were a little greasy. This chilis proved that they can master both Mexican and American food. I had a great waitress named Jasmine. The only issue we had was that are waitress messed Up our drinks at the beginning. Other than that, this was by far my favorite chilis I have ever been too",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southington,,,,,
2,Nick G.,"Bristol, CT",0,1,,1.0,2017-12-29,We were charged for a extra salad that we never got and the food was VERY late and we asked our waiter about the salad and she said that she was going to get it because it was already made and she forgot to bring it out. Next thing we know we see her serving another person so we ask her and she said the manager was going to bring it out. After about 30 minutes of waiting we finally got the salad and they got us the wrong dressing,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-southington,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48

The resturant was not busy and we had to wait for our drinks and one was wrong we ordered a water and gingerale and got two waters. The burger that was ordered did not have mayo as requested on it and no mayo on the side as requested either. Another waiter had to come and help.
