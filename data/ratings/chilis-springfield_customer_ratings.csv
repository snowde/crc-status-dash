2,Troy M.,"Hephzibah, GA",22,180,67.0,1.0,2012-07-02,"I like Chilis and frequent this chain often but this visit sucked.  Me and two friends went in for an early dinner. I ordered a steak cooked rare, it came out medium and it was very tough. One of my friends ordered a burger and the bun was very nearly burnt, overdone. For some reason it took almost an hour to get our food (it wasn't that busy). I had to request a knife with my steak (thought that was a no brainer) and I had to ask for Â spoon for my friend who ordered tacos that came with a side of beans. Also at the end of the meal we asked for our check and a to-go box and then the waitress repeated it back to us with an attitude like it was the most inconvenient thing we could possibly ask for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-springfield,,,,,

I eat out a lot, but tend to try to order stuff that isn't too unhealthy.  Service is hit or miss.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-springfield,,,,,
