67,Thats RN To You X.,"Staten Island, NY",0,13,,2.0,2012-12-03,Our bartender was Paige on a Sunday afternoon for a football game. No personality and looked like she didn't even enjoy doing her job. The guys next to me even made a comment on how horrible she was.  We asked for the appetizer first and it came out all together with our meal. We weren't going to send the main dish back so we were forced to eat it all together.  It just seemed like we were a bother to her and the vibe was felt within the other customers as well. Will never come back with my friends for Sunday football.

53,Rose C.,"Manhattan, NY",21,98,1.0,4.0,2012-12-11,"Normally I would never go to this type of restaurant. I just don't have a lot of confidence in these food franchises but I was clearly wrong where this place is concerned. I visited Chilis for the first time because a friend is a fan and I was going to get her a gift card. However, I was curious and wanted to check it out first, just in case. Well, the food was great. We ordered the chicken ranch quesadilla and it was delicious. My only complaint is that for the price there should have been a little more of it. I had the chicken margarita entree which was tender and flavorful and very filling. For an addl three bucks, they added some grilled shrimp to my dish and they were also great. My girlfriend had the combo with steak and chicken and that was also delicious, especially the steak. So juicy and savory, you almost didn't need a knife. I know, it's amazing, who would've thought Chilis? We sat in a booth near the bar and the multiple tv screens were cool to watch while waited for food. The waitress was nice and efficient and all our needs were taken care of. I didn't give them 5 stars because I thought the prices were a little high but other than that, I recommend this place for a quick meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-staten-island?start=60,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000007

65,Elizabeth T.,"Staten Island, NY",133,227,,3.0,2013-04-24,"I really love Chili's. As far as chain restaurants go, Chili's is by far my favorite. They have delicious mini sliders (def. dip them in the ranch dressing, you'll thank me later). Love the appetizer sampler, get the boneless wings and southwest egg rolls. They also have really yummy chicken crispers. Chili's is my go-to spot if I'm looking for cheap, greasy food. Do not come here looking for real food. Don't order a steak or pasta dish and then complain when it tastes like crap. What did you expect? You have no one to blame but yourself.  I will say that they really need to step up their game a bit as far as service goes. I'm completely understanding when a place is crowded and I may have to wait a few extra minutes for my drink. That makes sense. But the last time I was here, it wasn't crowded at all and our waitress was horrible. She took forever to come see us, then forever to bring us our drinks. Once we did get our food she didn't even come over once to see if we needed anything else. Stuff like that really bothers me, especially when we saw her at one point talking with her friends in the back. Hello!

Plus the free chips and salsa on the side, but make sure you have lots of napkins cause the chips can be greasy and its messy with the salsa on top. They seemed to have renovated and up did the place, there were new booths and tables. The waiter was really nice and you have another waiter who works the same section that offers there help or can get you things too if the other waiter ain't available. I enjoyed both of them. Me and my girlfriend did the 2 for $20 deal which you cant go wrong with at all, not only does it save you $ in your pocket but they offer good foods on the menu including the famous baby baby back ribs that everyone can sing off the tip of there tongue. You get a appetizer and entree which is good enough for me, then of course you can always add a nice dessert but we chose more margaritas please! I enjoy coming to this place for my 2 for ones and just a quick bite to eat and catch up with my friends. I wouldn't come here that much but for the bar I def. come around more.

Not to mention 2 for 1 frozen or on the rock drinks is an awesome deal and it goes on at anytime of the day. The chips and salsa are the best way to start a meal. As well as the appetizer sampler. The only bad experience was with Pricilla the bartender. I asked for a Coronita. Which is the margarita with a coronita in it. She filled it up ways to much knowing another drink pours into it over time and when she handed me the drink because wit was so full, yep you guessed it ALLL over the bar. And I was the one who mostly wiped it down. Wasn't happy about that. Even my friend I was with was annoyed.  I gave this 5 stars because after terrible experiences at Applebee's this is my go to place. Fun for a girls night or guys night. Even for a date night.  I recommend the quesadillas.

Indeed I agree that service is slow & at times I noticed it even slower on days where it was nearly empty, perplexed? As was I how is it I saw my servers less than usual on a busier day. I am not one that wants to be catered to hand and foot I just don't want to be forgotten. I have to wave someone passing by or raise my hand as if school to get their attention on a quiet day. I am no means related to the mention of certain waitress who I will write below about & bartender in another posting, Priscilla but I never had issues with her or any otther.  Now granted I vented about my issues of the slow service though I must say the exception is to a waitress named Drea, very charming & friendly. What makes her stand apart from others is I have now gone on different occasions & can recall my orders or likes. She is very quick but I would say more than 95% on point unlike others not to mention attentive. Like watching the Tazmanian devil whiz by & getting stuff for our table even before we ask or have to look for her. If you should go, look for her or ask for her section!

Extremely long wait for menu, drinks, appetizers, steak sauce, etc... Our waitress would acknowledge when we asked her for something but then she never come back with the product.  This happened twice.  Example, can we please get steak sauce?  Then the waitress said ok and then showed up 20 minutes later clueless and confused.

We ended up here after a local Burrito Joint we visited didn't have high chairs for the baby and there was no way we were going to hold her on our lap while trying to eat so we left and came to Chili's instead When we first got here the girls said it was a 20-minute wait but we've ended up waiting more like 40 minutes which I understand because it's very hard to tell when people are going to get up from the table so I don't blame the girls for being off the waiting time After being seated everything looked and smelled delicious and it was hard to decide what to order, I myself ordered the Boneless Wings appetizer and a fish taco a prime rib taco and a chicken Ranchero taco  For a drink I ordered the mango Patron margarita which was very good and was served in a small Patron bottle with an empty glass next to it so I can pour as a drink which was a really cool idea. Also the Guac was very very good and the thin tortilla chips were BOMB Now for the service the waitress was very nice but our food took abnormally long to come to the table, I totally understand that it was a Saturday afternoon and I know they were busy by the looks of it but even so it still took pretty long. Overall good experience , 4 adults 4 kids $104.00 not bad at all , I'll definitely be back.

13,Queen Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,59,12.0,1.0,2016-04-22,Stopped in with a few of my girlfriends  from work during our lunch. We got seated right away. We ordered something right away so that way we wouldn't(well shouldn't be rushing) the place was no where near crowded. None of us ordered any thing that needed to take long to prepare. We waited 25 minutes for our food. Ok by this point i was slightly upset but that would have gotten at least a 3 star rating.  I had to send back my drink because the mug was dirty (so now we are down to them deserving 2 stars) all none of us were able to even eat more than the side of fries that came with our meal because the lunch clock was now ticking. We  were seated next to one of the stations that they keep the wrapped up knives and forks and some condiments like ketchup and hot sauce and stuff a waiter seated some other guests and went to get them some wrapped cutlery one of the wrapped sets fell on the floor this poorly trained waitress picked it up and flung it back in the basket. (by this time if i could give zero stars for that alone i would have) because that is down right disgusting not to mention a violation for a restaurant type of establishment. All in all if i was dying of hunger and was on richmond ave in staten island ever again i will not even step foot in this place.  Service=2 stars Food=2 stars Staff training= 0 stars  Speed=1 star  Not satisfied at all the wrapped fork set  dropping  on the floor  and the waitress putting it back in the basket was the lat straw for me. What if some child had gotten it and used the napkin to wipe their mouth. Who knows what they could be exposed to.
