17,Bob W.,"Groveland, FL",53,50,39.0,1.0,2012-10-30,"Just stopped by the bar and sat for awhile as the bartender carried on a private conversation with someone.  Two guys came in who were friends of the bartender and he immediately waited on them.  Obviously, they don't need my business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-staunton-2,,,,,
20,Scott M.,"Evans, GA",0,24,,4.0,2013-08-10,"Felt I should boost the rating here a bit. Yes, this is standard chain restaurant fare but its not as bad as the current rating. Been to this particular Chili's several times and never had a bad experience.  Wait staff is usually attentive and friendly, and our waitress on this visit is very personable. The kids always find something they like, and I don't have any trouble finding a meal and/or app that'll satisfy. Overall Chili's gets 3 stars as standard fare but the Staunton Chili's gets 4 stars for the good service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-staunton-2?start=20,,,,,
14,Jon M.,"Burke, VA",39,127,84.0,3.0,2013-09-21,"Pretty standard Chili's... consistent menu and taste, etc.  On the plus/different side, the service was exceptionally nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-staunton-2,,,,,
16,Sam O.,"Burtonsville, MD",0,3,,4.0,2014-01-13,"Been several times with my wife now and have always left happy. Food is very good and service is speedy and friendly. This is quickly becoming one of our favorite restaurants for a good, cheap dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-staunton-2,,,,,
7,Phung N.,"Houston, TX",53,217,242.0,4.0,2014-06-24,"Happy hour you can get half off on most appetizers, even the triple dipper! Their new watermelon lemonade is pretty good for those into watermelon, very refreshing.  Waiter was very nice and helpful. I think the only downer was how our appetizers and meals all came out the same time. I prefer to eat the appetizers first then have the meals right after. The tables are average size so with my family's meals, it was a bit uncomfortable eating since it was all cramped up.  I think my experience was good. I just think it's common sense to serve the appetizers before the main course.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-staunton-2,,,,,
15,Melissa Y.,"Harrisonburg, VA",0,6,,2.0,2014-11-21,"I am so disappointed at my experience there tonight. The servers were totally inept at their job. Our server was forgetful, acted flustered and was not very attentive. Not to mention they kept pushing using that stupid tabletop computer to order our food and pay our bill... I am sorry but if I am going OUT to dinner I am wanting the full service of an actual PERSON taking my order and checking in on me. If I wanted to order on a touch screen and have no personal interaction I would go to MTO at Sheetz. I think the servers dependence on those tabletop computers has lead to them to not being trained properly & having poor communication and service skills. Having previous experience working as a server I am empathetic however very strict and expect a high level of service or at least personability when at a restaurant. It truly is a shame because I was very impressed with their new menu, and the quality of the food i received was outstanding... however I fear that I wont be returning to Chili's anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-staunton-2,,,,,
13,Lisa S.,"Churchville, VA",13,10,4.0,5.0,2015-02-10,Update from last night. Manager heard our complaint and the waitress apologized for the bad service and they took 50%of our bill off.  Very happy that they understood and made things right!! Good job!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-staunton-2,,,,,
11,Kimberly K.,"Bradenton, FL",99,1,,3.0,2015-07-01,Stopped in for a quick bite after a long day of traveling. Since Chili's is a national chain we figured we were safe with going somewhere familiar. Our server was also the bartender. He was very nice but it seemed like he was too busy with bar orders and not able to keep up with his tables. We ordered a queso appetizer - it came out with a layer of oil on the top of it. We asked about it and were told that it is normal (I've never seen it at other Chili's ). I ordered a quesodilla explosion salad that came out looking like a hot mess. I don't see us returning to this Chilis during any of our travels.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-staunton-2,,,,,
6,Erma D.,"Fairfax County, VA",11,77,155.0,3.0,2015-07-25,"Heading south we stopped for dinner ~ 7:30pm on a Thursday night. Close to 81, the restaurant was fairly empty. We were seated & our drink order taken quickly by a friendly waitress. I enjoyed the Triple Berry drink - lightly fruity. We both ordered Ribeye Steaks. They came out quickly, were cooked to order & delicious - although way too big to finish. We were back on the road by 8:15pm - happy with the experience. My concern about the restaurant was the condition of both bathrooms - my husband told me the men's was dirty - he doesn't usually comment on things like that. I found the ladies to be pretty bad too. Specifically, short & long term cleaning issues - age old dirt layered along the wall baseboards, stall dividers and toilet bases. Makes you wonder about the condition of the kitchen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-staunton-2,,,,,
10,Claudia H.,"Verona, VA",77,199,19.0,3.0,2015-08-26,Same as any other Chili's. My coworkers and I often order from here due to the cheap lunch combos. The food is ok not bad but nothing special or great. Do like their happy hour specials and their margaritas are on point for $4. Can't say anything good about the service. Must be why they have electronic ordering and payment. Blah,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-staunton-2,,,,,
12,Patricia C.,"Waynesboro, VA",0,10,,5.0,2016-01-24,That waiter with the cowboy boots named Jordan is really good I tell ya! Great service and food!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-staunton-2,,,,,
5,Ryan T.,"Waynesboro, VA",79,14,,1.0,2016-04-19,"Made the mistake of working there for a short period of time. During this time, I opened a frozen bag of chicken breasts and found one with a spider encrusted to it. I told the manager and he tore the two breasts apart, throwing the spider- tainted half in the trash and handing me the other. Never in the entire time I was there did I see a single employee wash their hands. This is the kind of places that you are spending your money at people. Stop supporting chain restaraunts....they're not as trust worthy as you think...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-staunton-2,,,,,
8,Tyler S.,"Waynesboro, VA",22,13,,4.0,2016-04-22,"Really improved a lot since the remodeling! I had the bacon cheese fries, they were pretty good if they would have more bacon, they only give you a little to have my all your fries #BringOnTheBacon",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-staunton-2,,,,,
2,Sue M.,"Stamford, CT",37,209,481.0,5.0,2016-05-28,"Stopped in for lunch on a roadtrip. For a quick meal at a chain reataurant, this was pretty good. Service was excellent and decent prices too. The best part of the experience was the service. 5 stars bc of service. Would put down the young man's name who served us, but forgot it. Happy Memorial day!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-staunton-2,,,,,
9,Patrick W.,"Savage, MD",0,8,,1.0,2016-07-06,"Decided to try Chilis in Staunton VA yesterday on my way back north on I - 81 and was very disappointed!  The restaurant was NOT busy ( only a few full tables of folks dining ) and was well staffed, however, it took over  40 minutes before my food arrived and my order was not cooked thoroughly when it finally did arrive.  I had to send the food back so that it be cooked properly.  The waitress was apologetic and personable, however, the overall service was very poor.... not the fault of the waitress.  I expected much more from this chain restaurant.  As I drive this route frequently and often stop off in Staunton for a meal, I will choose another restaurant in Staunton next time.  I won't be back to Chilis in Staunton again.  If one has a choice ... choose another restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-staunton-2,,,,,
4,Tim D.,"Harrisonburg, VA",0,5,,3.0,2016-09-10,"Apon arrival the host/hostess asks; What brings you in to Chilis? Then after seating us reports the answer via the headset.  Chilis, could you please stop? Its Kinda creepy.  The food is usually good but the spinich dip has stangely changed colors, our waiter agreed but no explanation. Probably going to hold off going back for awhile (hoping things change back to normal).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-staunton-2,,,,,
1,Richard C.,"Provo, UT",71,16,2.0,1.0,2016-12-31,My wife and I decided to go here for New Years Eve because we both didn't feel like cooking after work. We were not really greeted at the door. The waitress that did greet us was bent over with something hanging out. We were sat and it took upwards of ten minutes before we even saw our server. I could see if it was busy but there were literally only 4 tables occupied.  Food took forever and never came until we got up to walk out. By this point no one was even in the restaurant except for staff. I should be waited on hand and foot.  Asked for the manager before leaving. Did absolutely nothing. We've never had a bad experience with Chili's till now. I would not recommend this location. Go to Applebee's in Staunton. They were way better.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-staunton-2,,,,,
3,Whitney D.,"Louisville, KY",37,2,,1.0,2017-06-25,"Normally love Chili's; however, this one not so much.  The service was terrible waited 1 hour for a bowl of chili, that was cold, while the others at our table had already finished dinner. Meanwhile, the table beside us, arrived after us, had ordered, eaten, and paid before the meal before ours arrived.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-staunton-2,,,,,
0,Brandy M.,"Easton, MD",0,7,,5.0,2017-12-30,Even though it took a half hour to get seated for dinner. Our waitress last night was awesome! She was so happy and was very efficient. We even gave her a 30% tip cause we were so impressed and haven't had that good of service since we've been traveling this year.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-staunton-2,,,,,
