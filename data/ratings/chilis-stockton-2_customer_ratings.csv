36,Dale N.,"Stockton, CA",2197,720,6554.0,2.0,2012-04-26,"2 Stars....yes, I have had better...ribs! Friends wanted to go to Chili's for dinner. They said they have decent ribs. Was worried that they come in precooked and they just reheat. According to the menu, they are done in-house. I ordered a rack of their signature ribs.. Sides of loaded mashed potatoes and the beans. Ribs were average...nothing outstanding...nothing that I would drive across town for.  They were probably cooked a few hours prior...and in the process of trying to keep them warm, they were pretty dried out.  Fresh might be better? The loaded potatoes were good...made with the skins still  on the potatoes.  Not over mashed.  Topped with cheese, bacon and onions.  I enjoyed them. The beans...meh.  Nondescript.  Pretty much tasteless.  Black beans I believe.  Would not order these again. Service was ok.  Mango iced tea was weak. It is tough to find ribs better than Waterloo or Texas Roadhouse.   They pretty much set the standard for ribs around here.   I have to say Chili's ribs were much better than the ones that I had at Royces the other night. To me, Chili's is an upscale Denny's or Carrows.  I have never been a fan of the restaurant.  I might try the 'all you can eat soup and salad' during lunch for $7.09 sometime...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-stockton-2?start=20,2.92,2.92,2.92,2.3760000000000003,2.92

As for entrees I got a half rack of BBQ ribs with fries and he got bacon ranch quesadilla & added southwestern Mac and cheese to his meal.  The flatbread (appetizer) came out at the same time as our entree so the waiter willingly took it off our bill. She was really kind to us.  Everything tasted average.

Point is, I got my food at 9:52pm.  I have never waited that long for chicken and rice!!  On top of that, there was a brown flake of something in my water so we shared one water. No one ever came by to ask us if we wanted more water (we had to ask them when they brought our check out to us)  The only thing they were quick on was running my debit card!

I picked up the glass and it was dirty with bits of food on the rim. Even though there was a straw in my glass, no way was I going to drink from this glass. Then I took one bite of my country fried steak and it was sooooo salty and dried. I spitted it out and looked around for my waiter. After 7 minutes, I gave up and reluctantly paid for the garbage on my table and left on an empty stomach. So much for lunch. I haven't and will never come back to this place again.

I could tell by the look on the bartenders face that she was a little irritated that we came and sat at the bar. I sat down and asked her (Sara) if there were any happy hour specials. So she showed them to me on their new little digital table thing. So then i ordered 2 orders of the boneless buffalo wings & a drink. When the order came out i was amazed at how much a short order for the happy hour menu actually came with. It was quite a lot of boneless buffalo pieces. So when the bartender gave me my check I noticed that she charged me 7.99 for the 2 orders which were supposed to be 2.99 Happy Hour special.  So I asked her. I said ""arent the boneless buffalo wings 2.99 for the happy hour special?"" She took the tab from my hand and said ""oh, you wanted the happy hour ones?"" With attitude and walked away. Then she came back and said ""well I can change the price but you need to specify which ones you want next time."" So I felt like she was trying to make it seem like it was my fault and her attitude did not help as well. So I told her that ""I dont have a problem paying full price for my food but what i do have a problem with is the attitude you are giving me. And its your job as a server to make sure you get the right order from me. Why would you think I wanted the reg menu wings when i asked you for the happy hour specials?"" So she then again grabbed the tab, left for a little bit and came back to change it. Then a tall asian man walked over who never introduced himself no did he have a uniform on. He had a faded red t shirt on. He asked me if there was a problem. I told him not really. I just didnt appreciate her attitude and the way she was telling me that I need to be the one to specify between happy hour menu and reg menu. And he said ""well it is your job to do that."" Clearly, they must be 'friends' and she went back there and said whatever she said. So I told him how is it my job when she is the server/bartender and I clearly came in here asking about the happy hour specials. Im sitting right at the bar too. So how is it I should be the one to confirm what im ordering. It seems to me she should ask the customers that question. Well he still proceeded to say no and I was the one in the wrong. They changed the amount but that still doesnt change the horrible attitude the bartender had and the un professional ""manager"" if even thats who he was. They totally made me feel like I was in the wrong which was only making the situation worse. I thought in the restaurant business the customer is always right??? I guess not here at Chillis.

But seriously, there are much better non-chain options around town. I went with a co-worker who wanted to split the 2 for $20 deal.  Two people share an appetizer and get an entree each from a pre-selected list.  We sat at the bar to avoid the crazy busy and noisy child infested dining room and overloaded waiting area. The bartender was super awesome and very friendly.  The little touch screen bar menus were also very handy and enticing. They do have great prices on their margaritas for happy hour.  Honestly,  you can make a better tasting margarita at home, unless you prefer the pre-made mix.  They are a little on the sweet side for my taste.  Nonetheless, they don't skimp on the tequila, or at least our bartender didn't.  She did a great job keeping us and the bar patrons very happy.  We split mozzarella sticks for the app.  After a few bites, I stopped because I was bored with the lack of flavor and sad for their desperate journey.  They definitely came from some frozen mozzarella stick farm. I swear those bites I took, are still lingering in the pit of my belly and moaning.  For the entree, I ordered the margarita lime chicken. It wasn't bad but it was disappointingly dry and bland and not very hot.  The plate was sizzling hot as we were warned by the bartender but the food, was 'eh'.  It did not live up to the vivid detailed descriptions or flavor promises.

We have been to Chilis maybe five times in the last three months and I only had one good dining experience out of the five. The rest were not good. The food is usually good (if it isn't cold) but it is the service that is so bad! The last time we (my friend, my husband and I) went the server seemed nice but the drinks came out slow and the appetizer came out freezing and even slower! When my friend was pretty upset so he complained to the waiter and asked for the manager. My friend explained that the food was freezing and that so far we have not had a great experience. The manager said he apologized and would bring a new appetizer out. Then my friend said okay we will order another round of beers while we wait... the manager then preceded to tell us that it was a rule that we could only have one drink per person on the table and then asked my friend what round of drinks he was on because they had another rule that they could only serve three drinks per hour! We had been there for 30 minutes by this time and had one large beer (which wasn't done yet). I have NEVER seen a manager be so rude... I am not usually one to speak up about bad service or food but I did at Chili's because I felt like the manager was attacking my friend. We ended up arguing with the manager until finally one of us said ""Ok we would just like to leave right now, please cancel our order."" The manager said ""Ok , have a good night"". We walked out without even finishing our drinks because we were all so upset. This is the short version of the story... my friend could've been a little more diplomatic but either way I feel the manager did a horrible job with customer service and could have handled that situation way way better!

My friend and I ordered CoronaRitas (which were amazing!!) but they took even longer than the appetizers to come out.  Our entrees took another 45 mins and also were somewhat cold. Many little things wrong with all of our food but the worst was there being a hair in our food.

We ordered 2 of the chips, salsa & queso - only received 1... This place is a joke!  So - why take it to Yelp?! Well, we always call management to address our concerns, as we did on this occasion. We were told that we would be getting coupons - yes, coupons - to relieve the issue. She promised they were worth while. Well - here we are, 3 weeks later with NO such coupon, gift card, nothing!

It took a little while for our server to greet our table when it was not busy at all. I think she only had 3 other tables, all of which were close to being done. When taking our drink orders she kept rushing us to order food as well, which is really annoying.  2. We asked if we could order from the Happy Hour menu and our server told us yes. A few minutes go by and the bartender comes to our table to tell us that we can't order Happy Hour from our table, and if we want we can go to the bar, order our drinks, and then take them back to our table. Which is ridiculous and honestly not true. I've ordered happy hour before while not being seated in the bar area.  3. It took forever to get our servers attention after she dropped off our drinks. My grandmother's water had ranch or bleu cheese in the cup and on the lemon of her water. When we told our server she said ""oh I think it's just on the outside of the glass on the bottom.""

It's $8, comes with a starter...I had the soup, but no rice or beans, and no guacamole.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-stockton-2,2.72,2.58,2.58,,2.636
