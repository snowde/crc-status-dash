12,Courtland T.,"Manhattan, NY",27,15,5.0,3.0,2013-01-17,"Usually, the food is hit or miss. On more than one occasion, the steak has been overcooked. Drinks are usually good, but if you're expecting the service to be anything of a resemblance to a real restaurant, try somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-stuart-2,,,,,
9,Robbie K.,"Matthews, NC",0,27,16.0,5.0,2014-08-15,"awesome service! great food! We were greeted promptly and professionally. Food was hot, fresh, and perfect.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-stuart-2,,,,,
7,Dawn M.,"Port St. Lucie, FL",228,262,250.0,5.0,2014-09-21,"Their 2 for $20 is an awesome deal. We had their sirloins, they were cooked perfectly the first time! The onion straws and jalapenos are one of the best appetizers! Great staff, definitely recommend!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-stuart-2,,,,,
10,Derek J.,"Stuart, FL",0,18,1.0,5.0,2015-02-26,"They finally have good sauce on the ribs. They have a slightly tangy but sweet beer BBQ sauce and a sweet Dr Pepper sauce... I know, sounds weird. Its actually really good. No shinner bock but its better than original. Place is remodeled and really clean. Quick service and if you enroll you get coupons for free appetizers. They have neat computers at the tables so you can play games, order dessert, play games, order drinks and pay with tour credit card. No letting it out of sight for risknof stollen info. Very happy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-stuart-2,,,,,
8,Loretta A.,"Stuart, FL",57,61,2.0,5.0,2015-04-13,Love what they did with the place! The staff is really kind! The food is great & I always enjoy myself there! You can't order bad at chilis!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-stuart-2,,,,,
11,Linda R.,"Port St Lucie, FL",10,7,,4.0,2015-07-09,"We take a friend's grandsons here for lunch after a movie matinee.  Food is pretty good. Wait staff attentive. Only real problem is their water.  It is DISGUSTING!! We bring our own bottles of water for this reason. Come on, guys, get a filter for your water!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-stuart-2,,,,,
6,Keith D.,"Boca Raton, FL",45,105,,3.0,2016-01-09,"The service was good, the food was fine. I ordered the fish tacos but quickly canceled it once I realized it was made with tilapia?!!? The fried cheese is good but salty. The shrimp tacos were pretty good - sweet (and spicey once I added some hot sauce). The screens they have on the table are convenient but distracting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-stuart-2,,,,,
3,Rashonna T.,"Atlanta, GA",11,162,289.0,5.0,2016-08-03,We were a party of 10 today for lunch and Jennifer our server was excellent.  She was attentive and food was great!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-stuart-2,,,,,
1,Kel G.,"Jacksonville, FL",9,33,43.0,3.0,2017-04-06,Triple dipper. Flatbread not photographed. The food was good. Customer service not up to par. Our food had hair in it. They re-prepped the food but didn't failed to comp our bill. Smh. Most reputable restaurants will remake the food and give additional discount for the inconvenience. Will not be returning to this location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-stuart-2,,,,,
4,Steve B.,"Stuart, FL",0,1,,5.0,2017-05-20,"This Chili's is a prime example of how a Brand should be run. The manager Anthony, who has been there since the location opened, has run his business consistently with cleanliness, friendly staff and great food. We eat there at least once a week. Kudos to Anthony and his crew!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-stuart-2,,,,,
5,jacqui n.,"Beverly, MA",0,8,1.0,1.0,2017-05-23,"this was the last chance visit before removing chili's from the list of places our group of friends go to. the food was slow to arrive during a non busy time, greasy or burnt when it did arrive, and servers were distracted and barely friendly. this was one of the few places to visit in stuart that isnt fast food or too expensive...what a shame.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-stuart-2,,,,,
0,Austin W.,"Stuart, FL",49,83,,5.0,2017-07-26,Not bad place st all im a regular and food is allways good and most staff are friendly but theres always that one,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-stuart-2,,,,,
2,Shannon S.,"Stuart, FL",0,1,,1.0,2017-12-08,"My server was very unhelpful and rude. Bad attitude, asked her for croutons 4 times and she never brought them. Took 15 minutes to have our waters refilled. She never checked up on us, must have ran to Walmart to grab a bag of croutons.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-stuart-2,,,,,
