It can get pretty crowded, no matter what night you visit, but it's still good food. We haven't ever really had an issue with service here. We typically sit in the bar area for the free chips and salsa :-) It's a good go-to sort of restaurant when you aren't sure what you want to have for dinner. Obviously the ribs are fabulous, but many of their other entrees are well done, also. If you don't like chain restaurants, then just don't go!

Some big chains, some with limited locations and some with just one location in the entire world. That being said, I still love the CRAP out of Chili's.  For a while there, my family only went to Chili's to celebrate anything. ""Just turned 21? Lets go to Chili's. They have a great happy hour."" ""Got a new job? How about Chili's?"" ""Yay! You just graduated! I heard Chili's is good for celebrations."" First of all, they have HH all day everyday, so that is always a good deal. I usually just get beer or wine, but if I'm feeling crazy I'll get a Marg (they have several flavors) and those are simply delicious. They have several different type of smoothie type drinks on the menu as well and those are really good. My favorite app to order is the bottomless chips and salsa. Something about those chips with some salt on them make me say mmmmmm. They have a variety of stuff on the menu from steak to fish. Personally, I enjoy the fact that they have a healthy menu and everything is really flavorful. Definitely try the Southwest Egg rolls. They have a dipping sauce that will really make your taste buds sing.  I may be a bit over the top about this, but it's honestly one of my favorite restaurants in the entire world.

Table across from us came in after us, received food before us, complained that it took too long, and got it discounted. We waited for our food patiently. The manager never checked on us. They kissed ass to the people complaining. We were a little more decent than them, and received no kind of attention from the managers. We did witness our server, however, getting a ""talking to"" by a manager while at a computer. How unprofessional!  Overall, the food was okay and the place was packed, so the amount of time we waited for our meals was understandable.

Of course this type of false advertising seems to be expected everywhere these days. Their avocado sirloin steak looks 1 inch thick in the pictures and rectangular shaped.  But what you really get is about 50% smaller and the sides are scarce too.  You also barely get 3 tiny slices of avocado.

Great margaritas here, definitely try the presidente margarita.  Salt rimmed glass and you get about 2-3 glasses from 1 shaker.

Phenomenal food with exceptional service. You really can't go wrong here.  The setting is quite charming - they really hit the nail on the head with the whole southwest-mexican feel.  The menu is dynamic and diverse - we had a hard time narrowing down our favorites (spoiler alert: we couldn't narrow down dessert and ordered two! ha! ), but ultimately, we enjoyed the following: Appetizers:  We got the skillet queso. The beef in the queso was cooked to perfection and the tostada chips reminded me of summers in Mexico in my Abuela's kitchen. You can order a bottomless portion of the chips for $3.  Entree: I ordered the chicken fajitas and was thrilled when our server brought out a sizzling skillet with freshly sliced peppers, carmelized onions, warm tortillas and typical fajita topping fare ( sour cream, cheese, salsa etc). The fajitas are of the ""make-your-own"" craze that has taken the world by storm. I felt quite trendy as I constructed the perfect meat and veggie filled fajita.  It paired well with the Arnold Palmer, and I definitely recommend this beverage.  My dining partner ordered the Old Timer burger - pretty standard, but grilled to perfection.  For dessert we ordered the Molten Chocolate cake ( I swear it's the best lava cake on earth), and the Skillet Chocolate Chip Cookie - can you tell I'm a chocoholic?!?!? They both were wonderful but the molten cake was so moist and indulgent, and the whole dish is the perfect ratio of cake to ice cream to melted chocolate.

We got meal very quick even for being a Saturday evening in a busy area with a large group.  Can never go wrong with 2 for 1s all day everyday!! Bonus points for sure! I felt like all members of the party were satisfied and happy with service, food, and drinks. Which is an accomplishment with 10+ people including 2 younger kids. I must say the 3 things I tasted was exceptional. The special side order of Guac was on point. I had some of the wife's quesadilla explosion salad the next day and it was excellent (and that's next day leftovers I imagine the fresh meal was even better). The newly offered prime rib was extremely delicious, many options with it too on the menu. I tried the smothered prime rib burrito. I must say every bite was delicious and it was quickly devoured. Interesting they had 2 sides of taste based on the sauce smothering the huge burrito. Ancho chili sauce on one side and green chili sauce on other side. Both sides were great but I was a bigger fan of the green chili sauce side.  Great addition to story. Me and another member of party both ordered the burrito (menu in picture is quite enticing and lured us both) and server came out and asked us both what sauce we liked. I liked green chili and my friend liked ancho chili. So she bought an extra side of each out for both of us to smother the rest of the burrito! I enjoyed both sauces, so I decided to take mine to go and enjoy it topping something I cook at home.  Chilis is always a consistent meal and good price and this recent experience solidified that consistency.

18,Brian M.,"Tampa, FL",1610,508,7701.0,4.0,2016-05-04,"Many years before the blue agave tequila revolution, I had my first margarita at Chili's Bar and Grill. Chili's still offers one of the best selection of margarita options of any restaurant. Chili's offers 2 for 1 house margaritas all day Mon-Fri in traditional, mango, strawberry, and blackberry flavors which you can get frozen or on the rocks. Chili's also offers a large variety of premium tequila margaritas for those that desire with Patron, Sauza, Hornitos, Herradura, and Millagro. Chili's 10 premium margaritas include the Patron Margarita, Blackberry Patron Margarita, Skinny Patron Margarita, El Nino Margarita, Tropical Sunrise Margarita, Blueberry & Pineapple Margarita, Platinum Presidente Margarita, Presidente Margarita, Coronarita Margarita, and Sparkling Pomegranate Margarita. In addition to Margaritas, Chilis offers 2-4-1 beers, wines, wells, and Long Island Iced Teas all day Mon-Fri! If you sit at the bar area, first come first served, you can watch the game and get free bottomless chips and salsa. Chili's fajitas are the most famous in the industry with that unmistakable head turning sizzle that causes a wave of fajita orders following anyone ordering one, according to a planet money podcast I listened to. The pepper Jack mushroom chicken fajitas are no longer on the menu but are still available and quite delicious. I either get the fajitas or the baby back ribs every time I come here. The fajitas and chips and salsa have kept me coming back for years. The fajitas offer so much food, they are enough to split between 2 people easily. If you are a member of the rewards club, you can get a coupon for weekly freebies including dessert, appetizer, or a kids meal. This Chili's on North Dale Mabry is a great stop after a Bucs game, Yankees game, or special event at the Raymond James Stadium due to its close proximity. There is a private parking lot with plenty of parking available. Chili's now has touch-screen pda's at every table that help you see what every entree looks like vefore you order, order, call the server for another drink, calculate tip, and best of all close out your tip with a credit card. More restaurants should do this as sometimes cashing out can be the longest wait of the meal. Our service has always been good and it's even better with these touchscreen PDA assistants! Don't get me wrong, most of the options at Chili's tend to be on the comfort side, but they do also have quite a number of healthy, grilled, low carb options too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tampa-11,3.8,3.8,3.8,2.7359999999999998,3.8

I called this location and the manager was very helpful!! I even received a text message an hour prior telling me the table would be ready. When were arrived everything was set up and ready to go. The ONLY concern was the tables were not together so we had three separate tables. Anyhow, I understood how this happened because of the area we were in.  This was my third visit to this location and my second time having the same server. Her name is Erica. I distinctly remember her because we initially joked as I have a sister name Erika (spelled differently). Well, Erica, our server was ON POINT the entire time!! She did her thing. She got the orders right, she was professional, she was fast and friendly. What more can you ask for? She handled 16 people by herself and didn't miss a beat!!

Of course I have eaten at other locations, but returned today to take a friend out for post Valentines late lunch. My friend ordered her fave: the old timer burger & fries....what a disaster. We got there a bit before 4PM, so late lunch, early dinner. The burger was a literal nightmare & an embarrassment for any establishment to serve. The bun had obviously been over flat topped too many times & was cared on the top & bottom inside bun. Even the top, of the top bum had grill marks on it. The preformed burger was dry & dead, we'll overcooked & inedible. There was 1 thin slice of romaine folded over for the lettuce. The pickles were fine. The ""fresh tomato"", was 2 slivers, that did not even equal a whole slice of tomato. The fries I had raved about, were limp, soggy, warm & inedible. I was so embarassed! I asked for the manager. Let me point out the restaurant was extremely slow at that time. When we arrived, there was no one to seat us, so we stood, twiddling our thumbs...starving. Waitress was very nice, but with only 2-3, tables did not get order right. The manager made good on the burger & fries & also removed them from my check. My personal problem, is he would not own that someone had a bad day & this must have slipped through. He made good on the meal, but would not admit the initial meal, NEVER, should have left the kitchen. This is where you usually have to applaud independents. They can only blame bad sales & food on themselves & not pass it off to the corporation! There are far too many superior burger restaurants in the Bay area, to put up with inferior food, unfit, in my opinion for human consumption. Yes the manager did right by redoing the dish ( not enthusiastically ) & comping the price. We were prepared for dessert  & then a nice long Happy Hour to chat & catch up.

I truly do not understand that (however it's not the charge that is frustrating it's the problem with inconsistent service-I have never been charged for the pico).  Next, one of our friends ordered a drink that she didn't like at all and didn't want it due to being way too strong for her-the waitress once again does a deep sigh and rolls her eyes, AGAIN...
