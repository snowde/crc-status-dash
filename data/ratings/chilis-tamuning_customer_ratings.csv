17,Pal R.,"Lemoore, CA",3,63,,3.0,2012-04-26,I had the ribeye steak. Delicious! Service was ok. Not busy so we were tended to. Same ol same ol at Chili's. The place reminds me of the states and that's what mattered the most. No mil discount.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tamuning,,,,,
16,Carol K.,"Honolulu, HI",5,11,1.0,5.0,2013-03-03,I' ve been to a few different Chilies but this one is the best by far. All of the servers and hostess are phenomenal! You can expect friendly and prompt service. The food menu is the same and they have a 2 for $25 lunch special that come with appitizer and 2 full entrees.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tamuning,,,,,
9,Jirvy M.,"Yigo, Guam",94,8,4.0,4.0,2013-05-27,"I'm a frequent customer of Chili's and I find myself always having to go take the drive down to Tamuning since the Micronesia Mall location closed down. There is definitely a reason for that. Memphis dry rub ribs! Never ever disappoints me. Today however, I was slightly disappointed not in the food but in the service. Of course, we were greeted by the person who waits by the entrance and seats you at a table. Our server seemed to be new as well as a bunch of other staff. It could just be me since I haven't visited Chili's in more than a month or two but unfortunately it wasnt.  I ordered the Strawberry Lemonade which I absolutely love. Its more sweet than it is sour which is fine and it is BOTTOMLESS. I drink a lot so this is a major plus for me. They also give refills in a brand new glass just as soon as you finish. Sometimes they give it when you're 3/4 done with the glass. We went with the $25 deal. One appetizer and two entrées. Bottomless tostada chips, chicken crispers and a half rack of ribs. I can't say much for the crispers as it wasn't my meal. The tostada chips were served warm and crispy. The salsa sauce had a kick in flavor, very tasty. We found ourselves digging in the entire time we waited for our entrees to come. As we were served the entrees I couldn't help but notice my brother's Chicken Crispers had much more than content than my Ribs. He had lots of chicken pieces, fries and a full corn on a cob! Whats more disappointing is that the server didn't bother to ask what kind of ribs and sides I wanted. I usually order the Memphis Dry Rub with a side of white rice but I ended up with regular ribs and french fries. For some reason I did not complain as I see a chance to taste something different. My first time tasting their french fries and I knew I wouldnt regret keeping the order. I wish I could say the same for the ribs, I was quite disappointed. It comes off easily from the bone as expected but the flavor is slightly lacking. There really isn't anything special about it that would want you to order it on the next visit. I wouldn't even bother ordering more than a half rack. Memphis Dry rub is where its at, well, for me at least. I suggest you try any other specialty rib flavor.  For dessert we ordered the Chocolate Molten Lava Cake. Probably the only dessert Ive tried at Chili's. I was surprised as to how funky the presentation looked when we received it. Usually has a scoop of vanilla ice cream covered in a chocolate shell on top of a warm, moist chocolate cake drizzled with chocolate and caramel. What we had looked like the volcano just erupted. It was quite messy and looked rushed but nonetheless it still tasted as it should.  Our service wasn't as great as it usually is probably due to new staff and this is the worst I've had with Chili's. I actually, for the first time, had look for my server to get a drink refill. So you can guess my experiences are usually very good since reading this review. I only hope I can get the same service as before. Ill give it a 4 stars for now if it weren't for service issues.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tamuning,,,,,
13,Kim Z.,"Yigo, Guam",1,6,,1.0,2014-03-29,No more Chilis for us. Service is way crappy specially the manager. Such an attitude. Every experience we have there sucks. Another ruined day.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tamuning,,,,,
15,Mike F.,"Tamuning, Guam",5,14,1.0,3.0,2014-08-01,"CHILI's in Guam... Not that my expectations were very high but there still was some disappointment.  Consistent for Guam, the service is below a ""normal"" chili's in the US but that should be expected here. The menu only slightly differs from the states, many of the same favorites to be found.  Overall Guam Chili's is still a good spot to meet up early and then... Of course, it still provides a great place to recover from the night before when seeking a late lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tamuning,,,,,
11,Steve A.,"Barrigada, Guam",0,8,,1.0,2014-08-02,Have eaten there 6 times - got sick (urgent need for the restroom) 5 times.  Service is fine up until you need the check.  Takes over an hour to get et in and out for lunch (never busy).  Angry every time I ate there. - never again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tamuning,,,,,
14,Tootz E.,"Yigo, Guam",1,22,6.0,3.0,2014-09-14,"Had lunch here last week. Walked in and the place smelled so bad. It's like the rags and mop used to clean tables, countertops, floors don't get washed and sanitized eww!  The food! Love it! Our server was awesome too!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tamuning,,,,,
8,Toshifumi O.,"Santa Monica, CA",4,25,143.0,3.0,2015-08-16,I had petit 9-oz Avocado Sirloin for today's quick lunch. It's much more tasty and sophisticated than I expected. :D,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tamuning,,,,,
0,Mara T.,"Yigo, Guam",6,14,,4.0,2015-09-07,"To get the best experience, you have to sit at the bar. I never get disappointed. The bar is always clean and there's always a friendly bartender. Drinks are always refilled and food comes quickly and fresh off the oven.  I can't say much about sitting at the tables. I've only sat there once or twice, but both times were satisfactory as far as I could remember. Try the El Presidente margarita-- yum!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tamuning,,,,,
10,She-ron S.,"Barrigada, Guam",16,36,5.0,1.0,2015-11-10,We go here for Veterans Day and I am a veteran and my husband is active duty and we go for a free meal and they charge us a Service Charge Fee! Are you freaking kidding me? Then it isn't a free meal! I can't stand that they charge you for a tip! If we were stateside they wouldn't have done that!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tamuning,,,,,
6,Epixz Z.,"Guam, Guam",26,34,16.0,1.0,2016-04-11,Horrible Horrible Horrible Horrible  This place is so expensive for so so so so little the waiters are so slow and they forget about you and my food was cold when i got it barf barf and my vegetables was cold I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tamuning,,,,,
5,Jin Bradford C.,"Belmont, CA",5,16,2.0,1.0,2016-04-11,"Surprise! They are still open! Please come and waste your money on microwaveable ""food""  I recently went here because Crapplebee's had its famous 35 min wait to get a round of draft beers for my friends and I.  let's cut to the chase the staff still seems to be uneducated in the basics of customer service! Guess they are too busy trying to snipe each other on snapchat. Either that or too busy taking stupid selfies with the dog face theme features putting things like #workgrind as the title. Literally saw a staff member do this while I was waiting 15 min for a glass of water! You would think that having such an empty parking lot would encourage the staff or managers to come up with better cross selling stratigies or at least beef up their service but no lets offer the same pre made crap we always have not to mention the prices haven't gotten any better I'm about 8 drinks in and this quesadilla still tastes like it came strut out of a Extreme Luncahbles pack you know the one for teenagers where you get a caprisun in a can... I think I hate my fiends more than this place for continuingly making plans to eat at these cookie cutter Corprate fast casual dinners. also the local menu is junk  Improve prices And re-educate the staff on proper  etiquette for a workplace!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tamuning,,,,,
4,Smith J.,"Orlando, FL",327,180,126.0,2.0,2016-08-01,"The rest of the reviews pretty much sum this place up. The food was bland at best and It was barely to be considered warm. One of the people at our table got his food 13 minutes after we all got ours. It was overly EXPENSIVE. Not the same menu as in the states. Service was ok, our server was attentive as she could be, smiling and happy which is the only reason it even gets two stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tamuning,,,,,
7,Joe S.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",0,11,,1.0,2016-08-05,"I think many of the other reviews sum this place up. Food is sub-par, service is spotty and expensive to boot. I don't plan on coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tamuning,,,,,
3,Jim L.,"Melville, NY",6,190,,5.0,2016-09-01,"Went here with my family.  I know this is a chain restaurant, but after coming from the Philippines, it was extremely nice to have a real Burger, with normal condiments on it!   My wife was extra happy that they had real Diet Coke and not Coke light.  Service was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tamuning,,,,,
2,Keila S.,"Barrigada, Guam",13,14,37.0,2.0,2016-11-07,"We ordered the bottomless chips and salsa, half rack roasted garlic ribs, and buffalo wings. The salsa tastes generic and I'd prefer the buffalo wings that Denny's serves. The ribs were alright.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tamuning,,,,,
1,Mercy S.,"Pasadena, CA",0,2,6.0,5.0,2017-04-25,I don't understand why this place is only 2 1/2 stars. Compared to ruby Tuesday they have better service and better food. Servers are very nice and accommodating. So there you are!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tamuning,,,,,
