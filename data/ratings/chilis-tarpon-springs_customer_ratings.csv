I arrived with a friend and we sat at a booth in the bar. As soon as our server introduced himself, we knew what we were in for as we had remembered the last experience we had with him. He has got to be one of the most annoying servers of my entire life. First, he was attacking my friend and I with his relentless attempts to upsell on absolutely everything, clearly not understanding the phrase ""No thanks"". So this continued on throughout the evening, in addition to the fact that he kept making it seem like he was doing us amazing ""favors"" like bringing out extra salad dressing and burger toppings for no extra charge and bragging about it, but frankly I wasn't too impressed. The final straw was when he admitted to eavesdropping on the conversation my friend and I were having and responding with rude and unprofessional remarks that were absolutely unnecessary. I should have asked to speak with the manager. Overall the appetizers (chips and salsa, burger bites, pretzel sticks, boneless wings) and blackberry margaritas we got were excellent, so I can't diss chilis food at all, but next time I go there, most definitely will not be sitting in that guys section!! This Chilis is great overall, just avoid this server if at all possible",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tarpon-springs?start=20,2.7600000000000007,2.7600000000000007,2.7600000000000007,2.7600000000000007,2.7600000000000007

My wife ordered a side salad and my uncle and friend shared the fajitas. Food came and at first glance my burrito shared more similarities of a small crunch wrap from taco bell than a burrito. Now come on, a burrito isn't hard to make but somehow was not made right. The fajitas weren't even sizzling when they came out. On top of that my cherry coke tasted funky and was told two tables behind me asked to cut off the ufc fight I was watching due to the blood. Really? What show or movie doesn't show some sort of blood now a days? Are you a hermit? Won't be going back to this chili's ever.

We placed our order online and then called to tweak it since there was not any room to do so on the order (Making sure bacon was crispy , and adding drinks) . Upon receiving the order it was nothing but problems , burnt burger with not crispy bacon , the bacon looked like it was just sliced off the pig , the soup was ice cold and clumped together you could hardly move the spoon in it which is upsetting because chilis normally has really good potato soup , the salad was supposed to have cojita cheese on it and there was absolutely none , i would of paid less for a garden salad if i didn't want that cheese . Ice cold side of broccoli , and the worst was the 2orders of  corn on the cob  i understand putting some spice on it although there ""new version "" of corn on the cob does not state that on the menu but the spices were litteraly burnt to a crisp on both ears of corn on the cob  , and my other coworkers meal was also ice cold and in edible . We waited longer than when they said it would be ready all to have cold and burnt food . The best yet our bill was $55 to be completely dissatisfied and then not even have a lunch to eat during our ten hour days we pull so of course i called the manager , he said he would "" take care of it ""  .. TWO WEEKS later we received $15 in chilis bucks in the mail today, which does not even begin to cover the $55 worth of mistakes . That is horrible customer service have someone pay $55 for meals and give them $15 in return , what amount of cold or burnt food could three people receive for that ?

24,Alice B.,"Palm Harbor, FL",0,22,,1.0,2017-07-13,"Horrible service. Very disorganized staff. Food is ok, just know you will have to beg for more drinks and napkins if you can track down your waitress/waiter. After they take your order, you will not see them until time to pay.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tarpon-springs,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88
10,Leah M.,"Palm Harbor, FL",2,39,60.0,2.0,2017-07-14,"Chilis is always just a decent place. But tonight, we had a rude server named Ashley. We were seated and waited 15 minutes and the manager finally came over and took our order since Ashley was taking orders of people who sat after us. Ashley then told us our wings would be right out. So five minutes later we asked her where our wings were and she yelled saying they take 15 minutes and they were on minute 10. The manager then came and served us the wings and said they can take 15 to 20 minutes which is horrible because they take less then five to cook. We finally then received our steaks which I love the steak with the avacado! Overall the food was good but staff was rude and the food took longer then it should of. Oh and I never receive my Plenti points at Chilis even though I put in my phone number.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tarpon-springs,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
15,Erica S.,"Dunedin, FL",19,5,,5.0,2017-09-02,This restaurant had great service. Several food options that could be made vegan. I got the Margarita Chicken Fresh Mex Bowl (no chicken) & the chips and salsa for the appetizer. The Mex Bowl was very filling and I had plenty of leftovers. The Chili's website made it easy to find what meals would accommodate a plant based diet. Way to go Chili's!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tarpon-springs,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92

14,Steven C.,"New Port Richey, FL",21,2,1.0,1.0,2017-10-26,Did not appreciate Styrofoam I do not want my to go food that I picked up an entire dinner to be placed in a carcinogen like Styrofoam I didn't think a chain like Chili's would be so cheap as to use Styrofoam hope someday the government bans it,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tarpon-springs,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68
11,Ashley C.,"Sparks, NV",25,3,,1.0,2017-12-05,"So I made an order online... It said my pick up time was in 23 mins, I had an errand to run so that gave me plenty of time to do that... when I got there I waited for almost 10 minutes before I went inside to see what was taking so long. I found there was no one inside and found that they were still not done with my order. So I asked for a bowl of soup to be added to my order, however I had already paid online with my card and she told me it couldn't be done. So you're meaning to tell me that a chain like Chili's cannot start a separate tab just for a cup of soup? I even had the cash on me! Terrible service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tarpon-springs,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
9,Suzie C.,"Palm Harbor, Tampa Bay, FL",1,1026,196.0,5.0,2017-12-16,"Stopped in for a late lunch. No-one was at the door so we sat at the bar. She greeted us almost immediately and brought us our water. We ordered and our soup was brought out quickly. The southwest soup is simply perfect here. I could of had three more bowls of that and been very very happy. But, I had a mex bowl to eat too. It was 'ok.' Too much rice. Not enough lettuce. But a fair amount of chicken. The food was hot which is what I like the best. The flavor was very good which is why there is a five star review. We would definitely return. Our experience here was very positive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tarpon-springs,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
