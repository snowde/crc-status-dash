69,SuzAnne S.,"Howell, NJ",195,447,179.0,4.0,2012-08-20,"I think Chili's is one of the under rated family places around and people think you need to eat whole meals there to enjoy, but in fact this is not the case at all. its great for quick lunches or just a no cook at home dinner night, but you dont want to order in.. Mini-me and I really enjoy Chili's and for under 30.00 for a dinner or 20.00 for lunch/we have plenty to nosh on and believe me it is filling. And I don't mean under $30. For 2- although it easily is, I mean under $30.00 for 3 or 4 people- here is how I do it.....and my discclaimer is that these are some of the option we have worked out for us, so depending on how you order the price will be more or less. What seome people dont see is the fine print- if your orer the chili -queso- YOU Get the chips and sals with it, so you dont need to order it seperate. But sometimes we dont want the queso..  For 2 -3 People We do the 2 for $20. we love the chips and salsa and the fries since both are part of the appetizer combo I order the fries with the deal and chips/salsa on the side. The 2 for $20. portions are perfect size so you are really not over eating, actually we wind up filling up on the chips and salsa so the dinner pretty much goes home for lunch the next day- Might I add, the steamed broccoli at Chili's is probably the best tasting aside from Outback's we have ever had. For lunch we split the buffalo chicken salad, order the chips and salsa and fries. The salad split and is still a hearty portion and they don't skimp on the chicken just because you are splitting it. For 3 people we sometimes just do appetizers I mean order according to your taste and hunger chart 1-10- 10 being starving. I think that for your money you get really great options on the 2 for $20.00 menu. For 3-4 People  If you're like us sometimes you just don't want to cook, but you are not super hungry either and just want to maybe nibble or split stuff which sounds good- go to Chili's order 3-4 appetizers that's perfect. Chips /salsa, Fries, Cheese Queso--YUMMMM! Sure it's not your 7 pyramid food group or anything but add a salad with no dressing and everything on the side, LOL. Once again - pick and choose the variations are pretty good. Right now,  my Chili's is being re-modeled and it has not posed any issue with service or eating there- in fact most of you know my issue with screaming kids at restaurants, when I walk in my super- sonic hearing picks up the sounds of overly tired wee-ones, so when we are being seated it has never ever been a problem to ask to sit away from the exhausted parents in that area, sometimes they need to just get out and enjoy family time, so Chili's in that respect is super kid friendly and I appreciate that. I give 4-Stars only because the parking lot is a bit dangerous and needs to be smoothed out and less speedway friendly. For some reason people drive like maniacs in this particular parking lot and I have not been able to figure out why.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-temecula?start=60,2.512,2.512,2.512,2.512,2.5120000000000005

She also wouldn't give us a military discount because he wasn't in uniform...he's not even allowed to be in uniform for something like that.

110,Bryant S.,"Murrieta, CA",132,16,17.0,1.0,2012-10-22,"I gave one star because i was COMPLETELY DISSATISFIED!!!! The food was terrible and tasted like it was made the day before or worse. The service was subpar and the guy ""Jesse"" seemed like we were an inconvenience to him. When we asked if the a/c could be turned up cuz my fiance was cold he said ""it will take a few minutes cuz it's an old system"" but it never shut off. They obviously didnt care about us being comfortable or spending our money there. If it wasn't for my fiance being so nice we wouldnt have paid for anything but the beer i drank. Speaking of, the one ""plus"" was that i enjoyed my 2 beers and the 2nd was delivered pretty quickly.  I understand that nobodies perfect and i am a bit critical when it comes to food and food service, but at the same time it doesnt take too much to satisfy me.

I parked my booty at the bar and was greeted right away by Jimmy. He made a few suggestions while we perused the selections available on tap. A large Stella and Dos XX ran $6 each, not bad.  I decided to share the 2/$20 deal with my my date. We opted for the chips with guac as our appetizer. Our main entrees were the grilled chicken salad, and the 6oz sirloin. The sirloin was surprisingly tasty and needed no extra seasoning or sauce. I ordered my steak medium rare, and it actually came out that way! Most places like Chilis have a tendency to overcook the meat, and have no idea what the difference is between medium rare and well done.  +1 star for cooking and seasoning the steak properly. +1 star for Jimmy, who never let my glass get empty and could keep up with the witty banter.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-temecula?start=60,3.12,3.12,3.12,2.6719999999999997,3.1200000000000006

And my son who loves having chicken nuggets and fries when we go out, didn't even make it through one nugget. It looked gross so I didn't blame him. Who batters nuggets in the same batter you would use on fish? It was more batter than nuggets. The service wasn't great either. We kept having to repeat ourselves to our server.

I order some chicken crispers, a pumpkin spice lava cake, and a strawberry lemonade togo. I had seen the confirm page and a time to pick up my food. So I go all they to the place walk in without my wallet because I figured I was not driving and no point to bring it right. I come being told the online payment was done and that I needed the card to pay with. I told them I didn't have the card because the site gave me in bold letters a confirm and time to pick up my food.  If it did say online payment down it was in small font that I didn't bother to read and that is my fault. What burns me is the fact the had my cell number and didn't call me to confirm if I knew that before I arrive, they burn me again to go call someone to read the card number off for me, but that meant I would have to have my wife how just gave birth to twins and had a c-section to get out of bed to read the card that was in the office. The third and final burn was when they told me go go home to call them and read the card number to them but would not let me take the food with me to do that. So lets recap the last part that I had to go home, call them, read a card number to them, then come back to pick up my food that by that time am sure would of been cold by the time I got home, after make two back and fourth trips to pick up cold food. I wont be buying from this place again because these could of been avoid all together if someone at the place would have bother to take a five second phone to me to tell me the online payment was done and to bring my card.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-temecula?start=100,2.92,2.92,2.92,2.468,2.92

Today we were called an asshole by someone who had to take our food back because we asked for medium well steak and received an over cooked well done steak.

Sunday, 9-14-20104 we ate the Temecula location on Ynez. We went in around lunch time. Bar was busy with football watchers, the rest was barely 30% full. Greeter said we have a 15 minute wait. Reason? The kitchen just got slammed with orders. I could care less. How about getting us a table ( I see at least 5 empty for our party of 5), taking our drink order, then explaining why we should not order for 10 - 15 minutes.

Except for one dish called the Mango Tilapia or something like that was not to my liking. It tasted funny, but me thinking I was just being paranoid, thought that the mango topping was a bit too tangy for my taste. Now here comes the kicker, day after eating at Chili's I'm driving to school and my vision begins to blur...what was that all about? And soon enough I'm in class and can hardly stand the pain of a headache reaching painful standards.

I can go on and on all day about the level of salt in their food. Why do they need to make everything so salty? A hamburger is delicious on its own merits, is it not? A chicken breast sandwich with all the topics taste great, doesn't it? So why all the salt? I guess it is to mask the quality of the meat they use. I am not sure but what ever the reason please stop.  Let me try and get off the topic of overly salted food and get to something more important. Flimsy nacho chips! Why? Chips and Salsa are one of the best things Mexican culture has ever given us. It is an attack on their culture to create meager chips and watery salsa.

We came in with about 22 adults for lunch one Saturday. We had made a reservation and had informed them that we would need separate checks. Upon being seated we asked for more of the tablets so we could have multiple people paying for checks at once and the server said she would split the checks and handle the payments because it would be easier and faster...well it WASN'T. It took her over an hour to split the checks, which were wrong and had to be fixed, and another 40 min to process them all. It was ridiculous. We had to involve management because it was taking so long and the manager was ZERO HELP. We were actually late for our event that we had all paid for already  because they were so unprepared to handle our group even though we made our reservations over a week in advance.

8,Stacey B.,"Murrieta, CA",0,9,,2.0,2017-01-12,"I usually love Chili's food and they almost always have great service. This time was the exception. I went for lunch with a coworker on 1/10 at about 12:45. We sat at a 2 top booth in the bar. There were about 4 people sitting at the bar and 2 other 2 tops. Not busy. We were there at least 4 minutes before being greeted by the server. She was also the bartender, I have restaurant bar experience so I get that sometimes you get tied up. She finally said she would be right with us. Which was another 2 or 3 minutes. She finally came over to clean off the table and, instead of getting drink orders, walked away and cleaned another table. I should also mention she needs to learn the scoop and wipe trick on the tables if you have guests sitting at the table already. Luckily the table was clean or we would have crumbs in our laps. She finally took drink orders and, since we had so much time, we also knew our food order. We ordered the big mouth bites and quesadilla from what we thought was the $7 lunch menu. She brought the drinks and set them down without saying anything. When she came back I asked if she had a straw on her. She apparently mumbled something about it being in the little silverware packet, which I did not hear, and walked away. I repeated the question. She turned around and pointed at the packet with some serious snarky attitude. When the food arrived it was the full portion. We checked the bill and sure enough were charged for the regular menu price. We told her we thought we were ordering the lunch option. She says, ""well that comes with soup or salad and since you didn't say you wanted those things I assumed you wanted the regular option"". Listen, I don't work for Chili's. But she does. I don't know the menu without looking at it or without prompted questions. If someone is there during lunch and you have a lunch menu, wouldn't it be common courtesy to ask if they wanted the lunch or regular option? We only ate half of each anyway which is the lunch portion, cause that's all we wanted. So we asked her if it could be adjusted to the $7 price and she kind of just looked at it and said, ""well I can ask"" and stormed off then had someone else deliver the check. When she came back to get the plates I said thank you and she did not respond.  She just seemed annoyed the entire time. I didn't catch her name because she didn't care to offer it. She was kind of plain and had dark hair. I understand that we all have bad days but in the service industry, honey, you don't get to show it. A lot of times, your guests are there to escape their bad day. They don't need yours on top of it.

I thought I had sworn off Chili's after a few horrible experiences, but we had a gift card and a long day, so it was a convenient option.  The hubs and I started off with a Cuervo Blue Margarita and it really hit the spot.  So refreshing! We both also decided to stick with the lite menu.  I'm really impressed when somebody makes a lite choice flavorful.  It's not that difficult but far too often, lite is interpreted as no flavor.  Chili's hit it out of the park with this.  I ordered the ancho salmon.  It was absolutely delicious and cooked perfectly...not overcooked and dry like I often end up receiving.  The veggies were also cooked to perfection, not too hard and not too mushy.  The hubs ordered the margarita chicken.  I tried it and it was equally delicious.  He enjoyed it so much that he wants to recreate the dish at home.  My son always orders the burger with the egg if it's on the menu.  So, he went with the grassfed sunrise burger.  He loved it!  Our service was also exceptional.  Everything about this visit was great.  Had this been my first visit I probably would've given five stars but it's really hard to forget my last experience.  However, Chili's definitely gained back my business and maybe that five star review is in the future.  Nice job!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-temecula,3.28,3.14,3.14,,3.1960000000000006
