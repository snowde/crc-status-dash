17,Sarah W.,"Calgary, Canada",109,403,54.0,3.0,2012-07-11,"Went to Chili's for a light lunch on their patio after shopping at South Center.   The staff was friendly, however our waitress didn't show up so someone else took our drink and food order.   I ordered a caesar which was delicious and made with horse radish - just how I like. My SO ordered a beer, but the staff member taking our drink order had no idea what beers they had on tap were local.   Big pet peeve is having an employee NOT know anything about the beers they serve! Anyways, our food came promptly.  He ordered the chili cheese fries which were very tasty and had bits of bacon in the chili, very cool. I ordered the steak tacos - the flavour and the onions were great, however the steak chunks tasted a little odd, sort of like moist beef jerky, not steak.  I really enjoyed my salad and overall the service was OK. Nothing fantastic, but not terrible either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary-6,,,,,
2,Steve M.,"Southeast Calgary, Canada",0,14,,4.0,2013-02-03,Had a decent meal. The 1 appetizer and 2 entrees for $30 is a great deal. Cheap date night.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary-6?start=20,,,,,
23,Geoff S.,"Kingsland, Canada",0,1,,5.0,2013-02-11,"Service 5/5, food 5/5, the space is deceivingly large. I can't wait for the blue jays season to start. A great place to take the family and watch the game. Fresh Shredded parmesan cheese in the Caesar  salad is just one example of how this chilis goes the extra distance for there customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary-6,,,,,
22,Judith C.,"Calgary, Canada",0,23,,1.0,2013-04-08,"Chili's used to be our 'go to' family restaurant. The food was consistent and so was the service. We went again last week after a long absence. Walking to our table my teen daughter commented on how sticky the floor was. Yes, we were sticking to the floor. Gross! You know that awful snapping sound your shoes make as you pull them off a floor that has had pop spilled on it? Well the entire floor from the front entrance to our table at the back of the restaurant was like that. We were seated and were given menus...and even the menus were sticky. They seriously needed replacing or at the very least disinfecting. I have children.  I'm not a germophobe. I do like things, especially places where I eat, to be reasonably clean - and this restaurant was not. Makes me wonder how clean the kitchen is and how thorough the dish washing is, too. I doubt I will ever return to Chili's. I like to be fed, not grossed out!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary-6,,,,,
14,Richard H.,"Graham, WA",325,1203,2707.0,4.0,2013-11-04,"We went here when I decided to go to Calgary as i had a craving to find a Quiznos lol, the food here was good, I had a Chili (of course) and the waiter was really good at making sure my glass was full of Pepsi :) One thing I like about Canadian restaurants (Im assuming its a law here they have to do this?- wish they did it in the USA!) is when you pay with your credit or Debit card, the waiter comes to your table with the charge machine thingy, I like that!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary-6,,,,,
0,Kholood A.,"Calgary, Canada",0,10,,1.0,2014-01-03,"Awful!! I gave it 1 star coz I can't give less, disgusting food, I've been to chilis all over the world as it's an American franchise but chilis here is awful, the picture u see in the menu has nothing to do with what u get! Food is dry n tasteless veg is soggy and the service is the worst.. Never going again for sure!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary-6?start=20,,,,,
18,Gustavo M.,"Southeast Calgary, Calgary, Canada",50,46,7.0,5.0,2014-06-29,"Great place for burgers! Awesome spinach dip too. Totally recommended, even better than in US",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary-6,,,,,
3,Breanne H.,"Calgary, Canada",0,5,,1.0,2014-07-21,"Went there last night, will not be returning. Was told after the fact that it was the waitresses first night, but still didn't excuse the attitude she gave us when we ASKED for a drink refill: ""oh, alright"".  Sorry for the inconvenience! She didn't know what beer was on tap or soup (carry a cheat sheet if you don't know!).  Not once did she come during our meal to see how things were.  And it didn't stop there - food was horrible also.  Fries so salty no one could eat them, steak was way over well done like a hockey puck, veggies were soggy, meals incorrect and portions were a joke.  3 tiny fajita shells dished out, and of course no waitress to come back to serve more, so my husband only got to eat 1/3 of his meal.  Appetizers came after entrées were served.  Only saving grace was that the manager comped our meal, but still, there was SUCH a lack of service AND poor food quality, it was just a waste of time.  Had to come home a prepare a meal for my daughter because it was that bad.  Too bad, considering I've had the same meal at the one in the NE and it was phenomenal - never had issues there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary-6?start=20,,,,,
19,Davo F.,"Calgary, Canada",0,5,,1.0,2014-10-05,"Been coming here with my family at least 6 years. So very surprised at the service ... Or lack of when we came in last night .  Our drink order was at least 15mins. Our food order was 30 mins (ordered at time of drink order ) family across from us was there before we were and they didn't get their food until at least 10 mins after ours.  I ordered sweet potato fries and the basket was half as full as my sons order. We asked if I could get more. The waiters complained a bit, then said she would. These never came ... (They did adjust the cheque) but it's not about money at this point.  Back when our orders did come, the 2 waitresses that brought them out dropped them in front of us regardless of where our hands or utensils were.  Not sure if we would go back. Not cheap , crappy service, small portions. Not sure why we would . Too bad , was one of our regular places.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary-6,,,,,
9,Kenneth N.,"Richmond, Canada",2248,6665,9584.0,3.0,2014-12-25,"Solid 3.5, while it looks tall and big from the outside, just average size. Friendly hostess asked if we wanted the restaurant or the bar, so of course the sports tv's drew our attention.  Liked how the booth seating's available. Ordered the pulled pork wraps off their specials of the month, good tasting with the various sauces, comes in 4's.  A bit too overdone with the sauces but worth eating again. But not the cookie in a skillet with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, pretty average. My 1st time @ a Chili's since none in Vancouver. At the mall, but separate entrance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary-6,,,,,
4,Andrea D.,"Calgary, Canada",0,15,,3.0,2015-06-28,"This place is pretty decent. The fajitas are really good, but the cheese is a little overwhelming if you decide to put it on. All the other condiments you can choose to put on are great though. Portions are gigantic but everything's bigger in Texas. I got the crispy chicken crispers and it's basically 5 huge pieces of strip (and I mean ridiculously huge) - but the gold yukon fries are awesome. I couldn't even finish and had to take it in a box home with me and managed to finish maybe 3 pieces of chicken.  It should be noted we went on a weekday afternoon around 3pm when it wasn't busy but the service was quick and pretty much efficient. We did not get ""welcomed to Chili's"" though. If you get it. [saxophone in the distance] + Good service + Solid wait time + The door handles ARE LITTLE PEPPERS + Chili cut-outs in the chairs + The condiment stand that came with the fajitas had a handle shaped like a chili pepper - Huge portions and on the pricier side but those are related to each other. If you get the crispy chicken crispers or the fajitas, just make sure you're splitting it between two people, unless you're ridiculously hungry/plan on taking leftovers home.  - When we finished, my friends stood up and that's when you really, you know, feel it. But we were eating at Chili's so obviously we knew what was coming. I'd recommend this place if you're prepared to eat a lot and you're not like, bringing your boyfriend or girlfriend here on the first date. Also, you should make it so that the toilet flushers in the bathroom become shaped like chili peppers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary-6,,,,,
16,Jennifer M.,"Innisfil, Canada",0,1,,1.0,2015-08-23,"Must be honest, after years of running restaurants and eating in a variety of them, the world over, this was by far the worst experience I have ever had. We had to wipe down or own table on the patio, the service incredibly slow, the waitress complacent and finally I had to get up to get our cutlery. Wow! It takes a lot to shake me up, but it was an upsetting experience. Even my children noticed. And all this on a quiet eve in the restaurant. I will not return. I've never written a negative review, but feel folks should know before making this choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary-6,,,,,
13,Nick C.,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",24,29,5.0,1.0,2015-08-29,Came here on a Saturday night. 26 degrees out and the patio was closed. If it weren't for the great snow-jitos we would have gone elsewhere.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary-6,,,,,
20,david d.,"Calgary, Canada",0,25,,3.0,2015-09-15,Service was good. food hot and tasty. Could have been better but could have been a lot worse,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary-6,,,,,
12,Jason C.,"Aldersyde, Canada",2,3,,1.0,2016-02-22,We walked in a 11:45am.  Stood there for 5 minutes or more. No hostess around. Saw one waitress serving a few tables but no one looked our way. We walked over to milestones and were seated promptly by a smiling hostess.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary-6,,,,,
6,Elizabeth W.,"Calgary, Canada",17,35,,4.0,2016-06-03,"Do you remember that Dane Cook skit where the woman is getting really excited about pickles? ""And the pickles.... *gasp* and the piccckklleeessssss...""? That's how I feel about Chili's deep fried pickles. They're thinly sliced so it's not like eating a tube of lava when you get wedged fried pickles. The batter is flaky and amazing and the dip is divine. If there's a heaven, it'll be filled with Chili's fried pickles.  We usually go for burgers or ribs and are never disappointed. The fries tend to be pretty salty but definitely edible. Service can sometimes be a bit on the slow side if they're understaffed but that's to be expected.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary-6,,,,,
10,Scott F.,"Division No. 6, Canada",0,10,3.0,1.0,2016-07-15,"Went to Chili's Southcentre last night with my family.  We were the last table ordering for the night.  The three of us ordered steak sandwiches, 1 medium, 2 medium rare.  When they came out, there were 3 different shapes and sizes, 2 well done and on med. rare.  We sent two back... Instead of refiring them, the tool the one I cut into and sent it back out to my wife... After I'd cut into it. Then they asked us if we wanted new steaks... Yes we did.  So, the second set came out again, 17 minutes later, both again well done... At which point we were told ""That's how we do Medium rare"". Keep in mind, one was to be Medium! Worst meal I've ever had here! To top it off, we were close to the kitchen, and the Language coming out of there was far from child-friendly.  All for a $77.00 meal... Went to email the restaurant, can't seem to do it, Canadian website is even out of date!  When required to enter dining date, it won't allow a 2016 date! A real let down!  Shame, we used to enjoy going here.  Will be some time before we try them again... If ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary-6,,,,,
8,Cody T.,"Calgary, Canada",0,6,8.0,4.0,2016-11-23,"The food can be hit and miss sometimes, if you go on an off time you can find yourself in a long wait, but that's the nature of going out for dinner sometimes, ultimately though they deserve a 4.5 in my books simply because.. Waitress said I looked like Mark Wallberg 10/10 would blow my ego up there everyday ! Seriously though, I may open up a restaurant and base all of my interactions by complimenting people on how they look like celebrity xyz, as long as they're good looking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary-6,,,,,
11,Kadam M.,"Calgary, Canada",0,9,1.0,2.0,2016-11-26,"We were in on Sunday and if rumours are true that this is new staff day the service /food showed. The food took a long time-especially the appetizers! Glad we ordered that at least. The jalepeño wings lacked flavour/zip, they were quite bland. The avocado dip was good. One of our orders was two types of meat, it came with shrimp which wasn't ordered. Our other two orders came with mostly undesirable avocado (spoiled). We got one refill and rarely saw our server though it wasn't busy. Probably won't be back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary-6,,,,,
7,Kimberlie W.,"Calgary, Canada",64,12,29.0,1.0,2016-12-26,We stopped in for lunch after shopping. It took around 30 minutes for soups and salads and a rare steak fajita. The staff is not even on top of the coffee or drink situation. My steak was over cooked and my friend's salad was dry. No dressing. I am in the industry and there is no reason for anything that we ordered to to take this long. It wasn't even busy. The baked potato was very bland and there was no salt or pepper on the table. My fajitas were cold so i asked for new ones and the camw out cold again.  Although my steak was seasoned well it was over cooked and cold to the point of I could pick up the skillet when it came. We will never be back. The manager did however take care of our bill. That was very good customer relations.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary-6,,,,,
5,Jaden B.,"Calgary, Canada",25,93,100.0,1.0,2017-07-12,"We decided to go here for my Grandma's 61st Birthday. We called in the morning, when they opened, and made a reservation for 12 people. Therefore, they knew in advance that we were coming and were able to secure a table.  When we arrived we were seated right away and our table was clean but all the tables around ours were dirty. Our waitress took our drink order in a timely fashion and drinks came in a timely fashion but after that things went downhill.  She took our food order and it was an hour before the food started to come. Even when that happened the waitress could not remember who ordered what and we were left to figure that out ourselves. The food was coming at different times so some of our party was waiting for us while there food was getting cold and then j just decided to eat. By the time they were done is the time that some of us were just getting our food.  The waitress even completely forgot about my order and. had them back it and then brought me the plate which had just come out of the oven and didn't warn me and I Burnt myself by touching the side of the plate.  The waitress was the only one in the restaurant and was running around, getting angry at people (you could hear her yelling at the kitchen staff). My family tried to make sense of it and asked: ""Did someone call in sick?"" to which she replied: ""No I am usually the only server but we are never this busy.""  Then came time for bills and she still hadn't cleared any of our dishes. We had only got one drink this whole meal and some of us were thirsty and when bills came they were all mixed up and wrong.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary-6,,,,,
