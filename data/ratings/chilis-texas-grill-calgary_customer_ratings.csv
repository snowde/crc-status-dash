11,Paul H.,"Airdrie, Canada",1,16,2.0,1.0,2012-03-14,"Have not been to this location in awhile due to poor service. well tonight beat the last time, poor service, long wait times between food, cold food and overcharged to the hilt. two veggie fajitas, spinach dip entree, single pop = $60.00 Ran out of wraps after 3 wraps each, waited almost 15 minutes for waiter to come back to order more wraps, then he brought out stone cold wraps, waited 10 minutes between appy and entree with no drink refills. When we questioned the bill, as two veggie fajitas (no meat) should not be the same as Chicken Fajitas they took $3.00 off each entree. Really... the ""manager"" could not authorize appropriate pricing. This restaurant is like most others.... dram you next to everyone else so you might as well talk with strangers. Never go back, stay away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary,,,,,
13,Tom P.,"Kanata, Canada",0,52,,2.0,2012-08-18,"Not a good experience.  The food was generally ok and tasted all right.  The restaurant was loud and it was hard to hear what my kids were saying to me... And that is something!  The kids had the chicken strips, which were coated like fish batter.  They thought that was weird and pulled it all off.  I tried some and agreed that it was not so great.  Why mess with chicken fingers?  My chili was good, but 8 bucks for a small bowl?  They even charged me an extra buck for a small piece of burnt garlic toast.  Give me a break.  The meal also took a while to prepare.  To top it all off, some jerk kid in a nearby booth spit a mint at my daughter.  Not the restaurant's fault, but it was the perfect end to a bad experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary,,,,,
12,Bryan Z.,"Ringwood, NJ",0,9,1.0,2.0,2012-12-02,"When I walked in I was slammed in the face with the decibels blaring from the home theater system in the bar that was tuned into a football game. I wouldn't normally put up with that type of abuse, but it was -12 C / 10 F and snowing and I didn't have a car as I was staying at the hotel next door. The other speakers were playing Christmas music and the combination of noise was disorientating.  Otherwise, the service was good, the people were nice and my meal tasted fine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary,,,,,
9,Lauren H.,"Calgary, Canada",92,373,11.0,3.0,2013-02-04,"We hadn't planned to come here but after several failed attempts at other spots that were abnormally busy, the man decided this was where we were going to eat -  for our impromtu date night. The service was great...very efficient, bordering on cheerleader bubbly. Anything we asked for we got quickly and with a smile. They were also very clear in explaining who our server was and what other people were her back up if we needed anything. So for this they get three stars. Everything else....more like a two. We ordered wings to start. They have a choice of regular or boneless. We went with regular. They arrived on a glorified side plate with some celery and blue cheese dressing. The wings were absolutely swimming in barbecue sauce.  It looked like the wings had been thrown on the plate ""naked"" then douses with a bottle of soupy sauce. My date thought  the BBQ sauce tasted like ketchup -  he was kind of right. He had a steak dinner. They made him cut into his steak as soon as they put it down to ensure it was cooked properly. It was but he said to me later that it lacked flavour and wasn't overly warm. He was also surprised you couldn't get a baked potato, just loaded mashed potatoes. It came with a very yellow looking piece of garlic toast and a few little carrots.  I had the jalapeno burger. It was okay but nothing to write home about. The fries were VERY salty. I had opted for a side of peppercorn gravy. It was good and I needed it to offset the salt of the fries. Margaritas were decent and they offered a range of rums for the man to chose from with his rum and coke. Despite the great service, the food, the decor just was too ""chain"" for our liking -  it really was like a Tex Mex version of a Denny's. The one fun part was the music they had on...think one hit wonders from the early 90's. Baby got Back, Ice Ice baby, Pump up the Jam, Technotronic. It was like being on a date in high school. Or something.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary,,,,,
8,Red S.,"Huntersville, NC",0,12,,2.0,2014-06-20,"Poor beer selection, high prices. They have a few new items on the menu, and I was hoping they would be great. I got the beef enchiladas, they were way over cooked. The tortillas were rubbery, and the beef was super well done. I usually love chili's, I don't think I'll be going back to this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary,,,,,
7,Susie w.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,37,,1.0,2015-02-01,Worst chili's I have ever been to. Will never go back to this location. When we arrived there was so much garbage out front I couldn't believe it. Why didn't the manager have this cleaned up? The service was the worst I have ever experienced. To many problems to mention.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary,,,,,
4,Cindy C.,"Comox, Canada",12,14,2.0,1.0,2016-08-12,Big disappointment. . Had chicken wings at airport several years ago. .. Was excited to see one again (I live on Vancouver Island ). 8 small wings for  $12 is just BS.. Ordered guacamole that says prepared at table sucks big time and was not prepared as advertised. .. Watery not fresh at all.. NEVER COMING BACK...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary,,,,,
3,Akshay B.,"Brampton, Canada",0,3,,1.0,2016-10-20,"my chicken in my chicken salad was undercooked. I complained and the waitress came around the bar to poke it apart with my fork and then declaired its fine and started to leave. I had to tell her I dont want it and she got the ""chef"" who said its fine and that he can cook it some more. I was appauled that they would pick the chicken out of a tex mex salad and cook it more?  if you go here after reading the reviews and you get sick or disappointed...well you were warned.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary,,,,,
6,J M.,"Calgary, Canada",1,16,3.0,4.0,2016-10-29,Great food. Good prices. Free dessert on your birthday if you sign up for their emails,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary,,,,,
2,Chris C.,"Calgary, Canada",20,83,6.0,1.0,2016-11-15,"I want to start off my review by saying I go to this place ALL the time. and if I was doing this review last week. I would probably give them 4 or 5 stars.  Today I was there and we got our usual server. She knows what we want because we usually order the same thing.  Today the service was HORRIBLE.  it took forever to get our food.  As it turns out our food was sitting under a heat lamp for some time.  When I got my quesadilla (gluten free), The same thing I order every week when I come here.  It was burnt to a crisp., It was dry and gross. They offered me to replace it but we waited for almost 30 minutes to get our food and I needed to be back at work.  the insult to injury at the end of the day is that they charged me for my order. Full price.  I am extremely disappointed as we've had way better service from these guys in the past. UPDATE!!!! We thought we would give this place another try. Sadly the same thing happened to us in almost the exact same way. I will not be returning",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary,,,,,
0,Heather V.,"Calgary, Canada",24,63,61.0,5.0,2017-01-16,"Went in late afternoon for a birthday dinner. Had a wonderfully delicious margarita. Drink prices were very reasonable for the size, I might make this my go to place for drinks!  Ordered chips and salsa, which are now bottomless. They were thin and crisp and the salsa was very good.  Dinner was their famous fajitas. My only complaint is the steak was sliced with the grain so it made for a chewy bite and I couldn't bite through it so I'd end up with the whole slice hanging from my mouth.  Flavour was nice and I would definitely order them again.  Service was exceptional! She was on top of refills and anything else that was needed.  It's been awhile since I've been here and they used to not be the best but it seems things have changed. I hope it wasn't just the day we were there. I'll be back for sure!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary,,,,,
5,Gord C.,"Gleichen, Canada",0,1,,5.0,2017-02-05,Full of flavour. Ribs and loaded mash potatoes were the best I've had in a restaurant.  I'll definitely be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary,,,,,
1,M C.,"Victoria, Canada",0,43,164.0,5.0,2017-05-18,"First time here and I thought it was really good. I enjoyed the food . My hubs and son ordered the steak dinner for $35 for 2 6oz steaks, loaded mash broc  and an appy. I ordered the chicken and waffle appetizer and it came with 2 . It was actually quite substantial. It was exactly what I was craving. Loved it . Wish there was one closer to my home in Vancouver. Our server Hailey was also very helpful. Good service good food and good value.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-texas-grill-calgary,,,,,
