40,Lee P.,"Spring, TX",1,15,,1.0,2012-02-08,"My wife was working late one night last week so my daughter and I went to this Chilis for dinner because it is close to our house. No host or hostess at the front and we waited literally over 5 minutes for someone else to finally stop and ask if they could help. We were seated and at the time 6 tables were occupied at the time. 2 waitresses were on duty. Over 8 minutes elapsed before the waitress handling the far section stopped by and took our orders. Overall, our waitress actually waited on us once. The same person did not visit our table twice. The restaurant smelled musty, food was greasy and slow to arrive and service deplorable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-the-woodlands?start=40,2.02,2.02,2.02,2.02,2.02

Amazing friendly and very courteous staff. With managers like Trac the leader of the pack and his posse of sidekicks Grant, Sasha, and Josh make your time here the best that it can be..

38,bosco w.,"Houston, TX",0,4,,1.0,2012-12-15,"This location is by far the worst chili's i have ever been to. I ordered the steak quesadillas. After my first bite, I noticed there was not much taste beside flour tortilla. I opened it up and barely saw cheese and a a microscopic piece of meat. Upon examining the rest of them, I was very disappointed.  Hardly any meat or cheese on any of them.  Do yourself a favor and drive a little further to the magnolia location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-the-woodlands?start=20,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002
29,David S.,"Spring, TX",37,33,6.0,4.0,2013-03-25,"Tried this place out for the second time, as I like to give restaurants a second chance. I don't remember the exact names of the dishes my friend and I ordered, but I got a big plate of field greens and romaine lettuce, with grilled chicken and a spicy sauce, it was good I had a Tilapia with a mango sauce, which I enjoyed.  Food took a little long, maybe like 15 minutes, more than I'm used to waiting for food at a fast food chain, and it wasn't even that busy.  What was remarkable was the service, very attentive, drinks refilled, constant asking how things were, if we needed anything. We truly appreciated a great service, and courteous staff.  We shared the molten chocolate cake, with caramel sauce, and a scoop of vanilla icecream that was encloced inside a chocolate shell. The cake was warm, and the difference in temperature of cold and hot was wonderful. I throughouly enjoyed this dessert.  The music that was played was great as well, a very laid back type of music, at the perfect volume, not too loud not too soft.  My only complaint this time, would again be about the smoking aspect of the restaurant. As soon as you walk in, you are overwhelmed by the smell of cigarette smoke from the bar area to your right. Very disgusting. But once you walk towards the main dining room, you can't smell it anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-the-woodlands?start=20,2.064,2.064,2.064,2.064,2.064
36,Dominic Z.,"Conroe, TX",118,63,3.0,4.0,2013-10-13,Close to home and you get good service at the bar. They still allow smoking and I am not a fan of that. But for a chain it isnt bad for a comfort meal out.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-the-woodlands?start=20,2.096,2.096,2.096,2.096,2.096

21,Greg T.,"The Woodlands, TX",16,159,,2.0,2014-07-25,"We popped in last week for lunch.  We applaud the new menu and think some of the additions are a step in the right direction. The place was also clean except the bar seating area. The big and I mean BIG downside is; this has got to be one of those ""slow learners"" in The Woodlands.  No decent, respectable restaurant still allows for smoking in the restaurant.  Nothing against smokers....we just like a clean - air and facilities - place to dine.  So, we think we'll pass on this place until they catch-on to what 99% of other restaurants in the area already know. More business with happier, repeat customers if you provide them with good food, good service, in a clean appealing environment.

14,Andy B.,"Tomball, TX",0,29,,1.0,2015-05-05,We have dinner at this place several times a month.  Reasonable priced with mostly God food for the money. This one time I ordered take-out fajitas.  Picked up the order and took it home.  The beef was refrigerator cold.  Obviously it was previously cooked but hardly visited the grill on the re-heat. Next time I stopped at the restaurant I called for the manager.  I told him what they did wrong; I got a blank stare and hardly any more! I am not tipping that crowd until I know that I got the service I expect. That means that I will not tip for take-out.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-the-woodlands,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002,1.7320000000000002

24,Tracey P.,"The Woodlands, TX",0,5,,1.0,2016-03-03,"Every time I visit this location (3 times a year) I promise myself it will be the last time.  My most recent visit is certainly it.  Service is consistently slow; friendly enough, but slow.   Maybe I'm supposed to get refills using the electronic device on the table?  Who knows?  That whole thing is confusing.  At any rate, I'm just glad I had a gift card for this visit so I didn't actually have to pay for anything.  Also, based on the feedback I gave on the in-restaurant survey, my guess would be the results are seen immediately by the server.  Chelsey must not have been pleased I did not give her high marks, although she instructed me to do so (yes that really happened).  It's important to note that she acted annoyed in spite of 15% tip which is much less that my normal and more than she earned.  Luckily there are more choices in the area now that are open as late as Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-the-woodlands?start=20,,,,,

15,Eric I.,"Conroe, TX",7,99,77.0,2.0,2016-03-15,"This is a ""sad"" Chili's, stuck in some by gone era that should stay there.  I want to like this place, mainly because it's my neighborhood Chili's.  But first off, continuing to allow smoking inside is about as 1960's greasy spoon diner as you can get.  Second, it's always slow and there is never anyone there.  Now, happily, the food I've got there has always seemed to be pretty good, although the last set of ribs I purchased was the worst and most depressing set of ribs I've ever had.  For being so close to our house, rest assured, we ""should"" be eating there more often, but given it's quality, that won't be happening.  It would be awesome to see something else take it's place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-the-woodlands,,,,,

The place was not busy at 9pm and it took 20 mins to get our order taken, 20+ minutes to relieve our drinks, our orders came out wrong, and our server only checked on us once the whole visit. We complained to the on duty manager and she did absolutely nothing claiming they were busy and under staffed with only 3 tables in the whole place. I called the GM and never heard back...I am furious and have emailed 6000 of my email contacts in the woodlands to never visit the list location again.

11,Susan R.,"The Woodlands, TX",38,14,5.0,1.0,2016-05-30,Awful. Didn't stay to eat. Walked in and you are hit with smoke from the bar. But when you go to restaurant side it doesn't smell as bad. Hostess was completely disinterested and very unfriendly seating us at a table that had visible wet seats and still the seats were dirty with corn chips. So we figured if they were that disinterested in making a decent impression we didn't want to test  the food. Went to Skeeter's Grill in Cochran's Crossing.

When we first got there we had to wait 5 minutes for anyone to seat/acknowledged us.(party of 2) once the manager finally came to seat us we asked for a table close the to bar area so we could see the tv as the Astros were playing. She tried to seat us at a dirty table... we settled to sit on the other side of the room since that table was clean (but water still on the table). Took another 5 minutes to get our drink order. By the way there were only 3 other tables this whole time. We got our drinks and ordered an appetizer, when it finally came to the table it was wrong. Food was average, nothing great. Our table was checked on twice our whole time. I had an empty drink, not once did I ask if I wanted a refill. And she didn't ever come back to check on us or anything.

Today, Trace is gone, Darrin was off, and it went downhill FAST!!  After being escorted to the furthest table possible, we waited 18 minutes to get drinks... after feeling abandoned I went in search of someone... anyone... wasn't picky at this point. No luck... my friend CALLED... left on hold then disconnected. She called again... asked for thr manager - who was shocked that someone was calling from INSIDE the restaurant. At long last a server...NOT OURS but a server none the less appeared. Sensing our unhappiness, went to get the manager. She came... not impressed.
