0,Loren M.,"Reno, NV",2,12,3.0,4.0,2013-07-09,I only ate here once but I have nothing to complain about. The place seemed nicely decorated (more so than others) and clean to boot. The menu has something for everyone. You can get your drink on too! A safe bet for casual dining.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-thomaston,,,,,
3,G P.,"Atlanta, GA",0,59,,4.0,2015-03-19,"No problem with the food or service.  Amazingly, the well-salaried morons in the high ranks of the corporate offices thought it would be a good idea to put pleasant electronic game devices on the table and PURPOSELY NOT tell people that there is a cost (though minimal) associated with using them and apparently if you complain, they may delete the charge.  According to my Google search, this has turned out to be a public relations nightmare.  Somebody high up ought to be fired!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-thomaston,,,,,
2,Angela J.,"Seale, AL",1,1,1.0,1.0,2015-05-02,"Very slow service and multiple people in my party received food that was not as ordered.  Waitress was very nice, but when we addressed the manager, he was quite rude and apparently is unfamiliar with the concept  that the customer is always right.  We will not be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-thomaston,,,,,
1,Ash H.,"Williamson, GA",0,8,,1.0,2016-11-05,"Just going to say chilis in Thomaston is not the place to eat I just don't even know where to start. The service is slow & food is HORRIBLE! everything I order was cold & tasted like cardboard... took 1 bite of my fajitas & refused to pay, I've had better food from taco bell. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-thomaston,,,,,
