7,Mark H.,"Toccoa, GA",2,79,66.0,4.0,2013-03-29,"I went back the next night, and actually had the same waitress, and this time it was absolutely incredible.  She was personable... even though I had to have like 5 refills of my diet coke.  Food was delicious.  It was a fantastic dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tifton,,,,,
5,Melissa B.,"Panama City, FL",27,19,17.0,5.0,2015-03-08,"Always great food and service. The value of meal is plus also. My husband, myself and our daughter ate for $36. The staff was friendly and on top of things. They were relatively busy but the kitchen and staff handled it well. All of our food was delicious and brought to our table in reasonable time. I love Ziosk .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tifton,,,,,
6,Pippa S.,"Andersonville, TN",7,3,6.0,5.0,2015-03-18,Service was excellent the managers came up to us twice to ask if everything was great and it was great I recommend getting the south western appetizers and loaded mashed potatoes.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tifton,,,,,
0,Michelle D.,"Atlanta, GA",13,80,2.0,5.0,2015-06-27,"On a trip from Atlanta to Sarasota and back a week later, we stopped once each direction...on purpose. Chili's is one of those chains that if you are looking for consistency on food is a safe bet, and this location did not disappoint. Is it 5 star dining, of course not, but it is hot and yummie, and blows away the chains in it's price point. The way down was a lunch meal for the 3 of us, the way back was munchies to wait out the storm, traffic, and to have a break.  I'm a sucker for the chicken nachos and we all love the cheese fries, so that was the snack choice on the patio for the ride home.   The cheese fries came out with very little cheese, and I smiled at our waiter (Brian, who was awesome!) and told him I was about to be a bit picky...I needed more cheese on our fave Chili's snack.  He said not a problem, he'd fix it right up, and before we finished the nachos he was back with a new, perfectly covered in cheese, plate for us.  The manager stopped by a few minutes later to make sure we were happy, and shared that 'ya know, I agreed with you...that was a little skimpy when I saw it - glad you're happy'. And this is why I love a good Chili's...consistency, great service, no worries.  And lots o' cheese!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tifton,,,,,
3,Nisey D.,"Melbourne Beach, FL",3,65,23.0,4.0,2016-10-03,"Really good Services and prices. My husband and I had the dinner for 2 for  $20 which included an appetizer.  Large beer was only $3.50, yuengling which is great beer!  Nice atmosphere and friendly server.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tifton,,,,,
2,Kylie Horvath L.,"Saint Marys, GA",48,2,2.0,5.0,2016-10-08,We went to this Chilis to celebrate my daughters 5th birthday since we were displaced by hurricane Mathew and her party had to be canceled. They were amazing! Our waiter Anthony had his manager run to the store to get her a stuffed animal and a card for the whole staff to sign! Then they brought it out with a molten lava cake with a candle in it! They turned around a broken hearted little girls birthday!! What a blessing!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tifton,,,,,
4,M S.,"Kansas City, MO",0,18,,4.0,2017-03-14,"It is a chain and I'm not a big fan of chains. The bartender Blake made me enjoy my stop and I will come back because of him. He is a very personable bartender. I'm working here in Tifton for a month, he treated me just as he treated his regulars, rambled off the specials as soon as I sat down. That's what I like when I travel someone who tells me the specials, makes a good drink and treats you like he's always known you. Kudos to Blake! I would have rated 2 stars but for the bartenders personally I voted 4 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tifton,,,,,
1,Adam F.,"Starke, FL",0,1,,5.0,2017-06-15,I travel for work a lot and stop at this chilis as often as possible. Food is always hot and fresh and the service is amazing.  Haleigh has been my waitress the last 2 visits she is very professional and friendly!  Both this location and Haleigh are highly recommended .,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tifton,,,,,
