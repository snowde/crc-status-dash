50,keith m.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,10,,1.0,2012-01-02,"Worst service imaginable. Got our order wrong twice, and didn't let us know they we out of two of our four entrees until the other food was served.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-atlanta?start=40,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72

3,Linda Z.,"Venice, Venice, CA",18,335,510.0,3.0,2012-05-01,"If you are pressed for time to catch a flight, don't bother with this place. If, however, you have a decent layover or you got to the airport too early, there are worse ways to kill some time. You really need a full hour, minimum. The place is kind of small and gets very busy with people trying to grab a pre-flight meal and/or drink. I've been here a couple of times now, and I've noticed that there are far too many people expecting fast-food type of service. Look. You won't get that here. Bring your patience and an appetite and chill. I always go for the Chipotle Crispy Chicken Tenders (I think that's what they are called). I love those damn things.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-atlanta,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8
43,Mack O.,"Fairfax, VA",0,2,1.0,1.0,2012-05-15,"Normally, I wouldn't ever go to Chili's based off of poor experiences in the past. Unfortunately, I had a worse experience at the Chili's in the ATL Airport.  I made my way to the bar area where I seated myself. The bartender looked at me and said ""Great, what do you want?"" I looked behind me to ensure it was me he was talking to before I begged his pardon. He laughed and I asked politely for a menu and a Blue Moon. He replies, ""We're out.""... I obliged and said okay what else do you have on tap, before he could answer, a waiter who had overheard the conversation comes from the dining room and pours a blue moon for me, into a cup I literally saw him take out of a sink. I inquired about the glass and they were offended. Then, I hungrily order an appetizer. It comes out with a large chunk of hair blatantly obvious. I was offended, to say the least. I returned everything I ordered and made it back to my flight. Mildly aggravated.  Do-not-go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-atlanta?start=40,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
27,David S.,"Birmingham, AL",63,12,62.0,1.0,2012-05-19,Chili's is always an easy decision to make.  It's low risk high reward......Chili's Too upstairs at the ATL is a trap. Don't fall for it. They are unapologetically slow and they don't particularly enjoy strangers coming in asking for food and drink. The menu is limited as are the smiles from most of the staff. I will say my waitress was nicer than usual.  Why have I eaten there so many times? Because I am obviously forgetful of a bad dining experience. Never again! Yelp will remind me to go eat at Sweetwater!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-atlanta?start=20,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68
29,Thomas A.,"Kansas City, KS",99,1029,1127.0,2.0,2012-06-02,"Chili's has a national reputation.  In my opinion, the experiences I've had a Chili's have been rather boring and average.  It's a safe place to take small children and people who aren't interested in anything but the average retail American fare.  I know this sounds snooty and I don't mean it to be, it is just not a very interesting menu and I don't believe it's meant to be.  At any rate, I quit eating at Chili's many years ago.  However, I have stopped in on occasion at the airport in Atlanta.  The breakfast was above average for airport fare.  On this occasion, we stopped in for lunch.  First of all, the hostess was anything but.  She basically waved us over to a wall and said, ""stand over there for me please...""  brushing us off and busily watching everything else but her customers.  She was dismissive, unattentive and lacked basic customer service skills.  No excuse for a national chain like Chili's.  After a few moments, she decided she could relegate us to a table stuffed in a tight space and we agreed because, we didn't have a lot of time, we weren't picky and it wasn't all that bad of a spot.  Our server was pleasant, attentive but way over worked.  She was flying around in a dither and forgetting things.  I think they had her spread out too thin.  We had to ask her several times for extra mayo as did the young man in the table next to us.  I saw her working tables all over the restaurant.  I have no issue with her.  I believe she was doing the best she could.  She kept our sweet tea full and the sweet tea was actually pretty tasty and not overly sweet but, then again, we were in the South, where they know how to make sweet tea.  I had a bacon cheese burger and there was a TON of bacon on it and the burger was more than generous but the bun was dry and stale.  The fries, again, boring and lifeless.  Why?  Why is it so hard to get fries right and for the prices these companies charge for this stuff...?  Well, it's airport/cattle food.  They move you in and move you out and hope you don't get too disappointed because you don't have time.    All this experience did was reinforce in me my belief that Chili's is boring, average and pretty much not worth my time unless I'm desperate, in a big airport...I had Krystle burgers on my return trip through Atlanta and believe it or not?  It was better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-atlanta?start=20,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
8,Cory S.,"Indianapolis, IN",89,501,18.0,3.0,2012-09-10,Pretty good service for an airport facility. Food was average for chillis. My chicken tenders were a little coldish but overall adequate experience. Less than 15 minute wait at 5 on a Sunday,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-atlanta,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68
34,Rachel A.,"Kew Gardens, NY",110,34,2.0,1.0,2012-10-11,"I had a terrible experience here and will never go back. My food was waiting for me for over 20 mins before I had to find someone if my meal was ready. My food was cold and tasted terrible. The chicken tasted like the pulled pre-cooked chicken from the freezer and microwaved it. Bad bad service, long wait lines and bad bad food. Don't go",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-atlanta?start=20,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
0,Angel F.,"Houston, TX",169,142,4.0,4.0,2012-10-18,"Welcome to Merica!.... This us exactly how I felt when I walked into the chilis too in the Atlanta airport. If just come off a 4 hour flight from JFK that was preceded by a 13 hour flight from Accra Ghana. Alls I wanted was some fried cheesy American goodness and this place rocked my world.  I loaded up on food that I'd never ever ever on my diet, had a cold beer and really just got down. My server (bartender) rocked my world with speed and friendliness. Oh, and he told jokes. Great way to be welcomed back home!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-atlanta,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72
18,J J.,"Redwood City, CA",12,56,,1.0,2012-11-16,"I had just enough time between flights to get a quick bite, wishing now I had not!  I contracted food poisoning!! Apx 6 hours later I was throwing up into the vomit bag on the plane. Not a good experience. Projectile vomit and diarrhoea is not what you want to be dealing with when you're 10K miles above ground. I've tried 4 different phone numbers to call them and let then know, and none are working.... Service was fine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-atlanta,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
35,Sara K.,"Aurora, CO",0,24,,1.0,2012-12-25,"Worst customer service, you just try to get on worker here to smile, or care that they just served you food with a hair in it.  I wonder if anyone from corporate ever comes to this location.  I understand people move slow in the south, but this is an airport and people are in a hurry...  very poor customer service.

1,Emil C.,"Irvine, CA",413,1057,4137.0,3.0,2013-01-21,This restaurant was tucked upstairs in the terminal. Either take the escalator or the elevator to get here. It was pretty packed when I got there. Yet I was seated promptly. This was a good place to hang out for a layover. They served common decent beer and most of their menu items looked good. I was pleasantly surprised that the grilled salmon tasted really good. The server was pleasant and attentive even though she was clearly busy attending to a lot of tables.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-atlanta,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
4,Lacee B.,"Phoenix, AZ",85,37,,1.0,2013-01-29,Hotlanta! We stopped by here during a layover and had the worst time. The hostess took my name down wrong and got mad when I didn't respond to her YELLING it practically in my face... Our server was nice but rushed us (gave us our menus and then asked what we wanted to order...we hadn't even opened them yet!) Our boneless wings were ice cold. Just unpleasant. Ain't nobody got time for that.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-atlanta,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36
32,Casey R.,"Round Rock, TX",81,19,3.0,1.0,2013-03-18,I was literally cussed at by an employee of this resturant while waiting to be seated. Why are people who work in airports so unhappy?

9,Bruce C.,"Gilbertsville, PA",59,21,,2.0,2014-10-12,"Extremely slow experience with marginal service at best.  Food was decent, had the salmon. Portions were decent as well.  Don't expect any customizations for the menu.  We asked for tomatoes to be removed from our wraps and they would not do it because we were told they were premade... so much for freshness.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-atlanta,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28
