5,Neal E.,"Haymarket, VA",1169,4363,28768.0,3.0,2012-10-07,"Chili's Too - is the only place to sit down and eat - post security in Concourse A of Louisville International Airport. It's right across from Gate A8. There is also a small bar here - so you can belly up to the bar and get your drink on! We stopped in here for lunch while waiting for our flight to Dulles. I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Salad - a greens salad with breaded, fried slices of boneless chicken - with a Blue cheese dressing. It was a reasonably good salad - hit the spot! Service was good. Don't confuse this listing with the ""Chili's To Go"" - which is next door and is their ""To Go"" counter for sandwiches, cold drinks and such.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-louisville,,,,,
10,Cosmo W.,"Apopka, FL",125,468,80.0,3.0,2013-03-02,"What can I say? Service with a smile, a cold beer and a a hot Buffalo Chicken sandwich makes waiting for a plane much easier. With all the lousy options in most airports, it's nice to find this oasis...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-louisville,,,,,
14,Jason M.,"Louisville, KY",67,133,216.0,4.0,2013-03-08,"This was the only place to really sit down and eat something not out of a bag. Wasn't too bad at all. The menu is limited but we kinda expected that given its location and size.  The food, however, was good and service was fast and polite. It gave us a decent place to sit and relax, and grab a bite to eat, before our flight.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-louisville,,,,,
12,Jeremia F.,"Pittsburgh, PA",218,421,61.0,3.0,2013-09-19,"This is NOT the only place post security in the Terminal to sit down and eat, There is a ""pizaa hutish,""place on the other concourse. Be prepared to wait for a seat especially if delays are adding up. I recommend ordering something at the TOGO counter it will take about 5-10 minutes but you don't have to wait around at a table and if you're tight on time this is a good option.  The menu is limited and I do wish that they had some of the healthier Chili's options. This could be 4 star if the menu wasn't so limited. The prices a fairly inline with the regular non-airport stores so that a plus.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-louisville,,,,,
15,Erin D.,"Albany, NY",86,2,,1.0,2013-09-29,This was by far the worst dining experience ever! Hostess and wait staff were so rude and seemed so pissed off. The friendliest part of service was when he delivered our check. Food was decent enough for an airport & chain restaurant. Will never return due to the awful service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-louisville,,,,,
11,Candace S.,"Aiken, SC",1,32,3.0,1.0,2014-07-18,"Unfortunately there's not many other options in the Louisville airport. The people are rude! I was told to seat myself, but only to find that meant being ignored. I sat at a table for about 10 minutes. Although a server looked at me several times, she and everyone else kept walking. I never so much as ordered a drink before I got up and walked off. I normally don't expect the best service at an airport considering they are typically unprofessional, but this is ridiculous. I will be calling corporate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-louisville,,,,,
9,B G.,"Detroit, MI",5,254,87.0,1.0,2014-07-25,"I didn't have too much time so I thought I would grab a chicken wrap from the Chili's to go location in the Louisville airport.  To make a long story short the chicken wrap was almost inedible. I didn't see an expiration date, but if I had had time to get back for a refund I certainly would have. Watch out for old food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-louisville,,,,,
8,Susan C.,"Skokie, IL",16,255,,3.0,2014-08-13,"You have to remember while dining that this is airport fast food.......the servers are overworked and service is slow so be prepared to wait.....when we were finally waited on, we ordered the steak and chicken fajitas only to be told they were out of steak. Settled on chicken fajitas which were remarkably good for a small cook space. The chicken was a bit dry but okay. Overall, happy....but know this: this is the ONLY restaurant choice in the United Terminal. Again, be prepared to wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-louisville,,,,,
2,Maggie H.,"Evanston, IL",390,461,451.0,4.0,2014-08-19,"Let's start by reminding ourselves that this is located inside an airport. Airport food has no incentive or desire to be good because, face it, they've got you. You're eating this or you're eating nothing. Suck it up.  That said, this Chilis (not that I ever really eat at any other Chilis and can compare..) is surprisingly good. Or maybe I should say not bad? I got the margarita fresh mex bowl and everything in tj seemed fresh enough. No Sad soggy lettuce or questionable colored avocados. It reminds me a little of a chipotle bowl. I'll take what I can get.  Adjust your expectations, and you can have a not half bad meal here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-louisville,,,,,
13,Bill B.,"Atlanta, GA",0,6,,1.0,2014-10-23,Watch out for the soups....microwave hot hot hot and it  burned my lip. Big disappointment,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-louisville,,,,,
7,KeiKei B.,"Sacramento, CA",54,368,271.0,1.0,2014-12-08,Drinks are high as hell and service bites.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-louisville,,,,,
3,Petrice H.,"Tampa, FL",58,89,338.0,3.0,2015-07-09,"So every time I fly to to Louisville I eat at this restaurant. It's not cuz I love it but because it's the only place to get a decent meal and I use decent very loosely   This Chilis Too is very small. It's like they had a few hundred square feet left and through it in there.  The tables are close together and no place to store your luggage out of the way. But if you're there just for a bite it will have to do.  I had the chipotle honey chicken crisper a and they were pretty good and picked a bit of a bite too!!  The fries in the other hand were like warm like they were sitting in a warming tray, which was very disappointing.  Their servers were very pleasant even the ones that weren't there for you. And that means a lot because everyone in customer service should be nice.  I gave them 3 stars because the space is way too small and I love French fries and these were no no Bueno!! Cook my fries fresh and I may give them another star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-louisville,,,,,
0,Mike And Nita B.,"Bettendorf, IA",20,170,,4.0,2015-07-17,"I had good food and good service.  Would have normally rated a 3 star based on food but I really enjoyed the service . Both servers that were helping me appeared to be enjoying their job and were hospitable .   Conversant, friendly and helpful. I just ate downtown at a pricy restaurant that could take a lesson from these servers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-louisville,,,,,
6,Kate K.,"Shirley, NY",186,369,503.0,3.0,2015-12-11,"The service here was awesome! I was immediately greeted with a smile and a menu even though it was super busy. The bartender was nice and gave me a glass of water right away. I asked him for his recommendations on food and he was right on! Ordered a glass of wine and the chicken with mango and for airport food, it was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-louisville,,,,,
4,Katy P.,"Brandon, FL",97,2,1.0,1.0,2016-09-26,"Zero stars would be more appropriate but that is not an option. I waited 45 minutes for my food at 6:30 AM, while at least 10 other people that arrived much after I ORDERED my food already received their food. I left a 20$ bill on the table and left without getting any food. The waitress kept saying it was coming ""shortly"". Chili's only serves about 6 different breakfast items at the airport. This was beyond terrible service. DON'T EAT HERE. Long story short I paid for my food and never got any.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-louisville,,,,,
1,Gigi D.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,9,,3.0,2017-06-04,"The service was okay,  not great.  Same with the food.  Only restaurant available in concourse A if you want a cocktail,  but I hope they will try harder anyway.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-louisville,,,,,
