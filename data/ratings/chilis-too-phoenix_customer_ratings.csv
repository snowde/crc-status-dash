6,Vanessa M.,"Winsted, CT",248,453,1098.0,3.0,2012-01-02,"Came here for the ""final meal"" with the now ex. before we parted ways. Food was fine. LOVE their french fries. It was a mini Chili's, nothing was less than expected..except for the personality of our server..It was like he used to work at a real Chili's then did something wrong and was banished here. He went through the motions but seemed like he was contemplating suicide. Not rude, or anything of that nature, just miserable. It was almost laughable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-phoenix,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72
7,Sam S.,"Taylorsville, UT",372,1260,2860.0,2.0,2012-01-13,Chili's Too is nothing special. They have many of the same items you'd find at a regular Chili's restaurant but caters to faster items to get people fed and on their way. We ate here earlier in the week and the service and the food were in need of improvement. I would not recommend this place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-phoenix,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72
1,Ty D.,"Redondo Beach, CA",572,559,141.0,2.0,2012-03-30,"One of the worst burgers I've ever had.  Overcooked and dry!  A Mc Donald's burger would be better than this. Service was also slow.  After we were seated at our table, we waited about 10 minutes before getting water and a menu!  If you're in a rush to catch your plane, then avoid this place.  If you have time to kill and want a really bad burger, then this is the place.  Otherwise, stay away!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-phoenix,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68
19,Rick W.,"Meridian, ID",0,16,,2.0,2012-05-17,"While the food and wait staff are relatively good for airports, the host staff is about as bad as they come.  No smiles, move slower than my 99 year old grandma, and she died 10 years ago!  A slow walk to the table, a slap of a wet towel on the table for cleaning and off she goes.  I get stuck with a dripping wet table and a bad taste in my mouth.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-phoenix,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
