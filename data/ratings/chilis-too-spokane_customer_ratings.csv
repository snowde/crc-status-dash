5,Mike W.,"Redondo Beach, CA",79,34,29.0,1.0,2013-08-19,"They don't even try. Cold soggy fries, overcooked, overpriced burger. Guess that's typical airport food. Won't be eating here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-spokane,,,,,
2,J M.,"San Francisco, CA",4,116,192.0,3.0,2014-04-09,"After giving the Oakland airport's Chili's a resounding 5 star approval, I couldn't resist comparing this Chili's Too to that sit down version.  I wish I hadn't. The food tasted okay, but it lacked the freshness and heat of the other location. Fries were lukewarm and the hamburger patty was well done, contrary to my request that it be medium.  Also the cook was very slow. Considering I only had two orders ahead of me, he should have completed my order more quickly. It actually came out at the same time as the order after me that a customer placed several minutes after me.  If he had pulled my patty off the grill sooner, it would have been cooked right and served sooner.  Should have ate at the sit down restaurant to the left of Chili's Too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-spokane,,,,,
3,Cassidy L.,"Columbia Falls, MT",106,325,740.0,4.0,2014-08-25,Need some food...get a burger. It's safe and affordable. Loved the jalapeño burger and the fries.  Eat in the little food court area. Looked as if most of the patrons around we're eating from Chili's Too and I'm sure glad I did.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-spokane,,,,,
4,Tim M.,"Peoria, IL",0,6,,1.0,2015-07-01,"I ordered pork tacos, paid, waited for 10 mintes when they finally called my order number (I was the only customer at the time) they told me they were out of pork.  Having a plane to catch, I asked them why they did not tell me that initially so I could have ordered something else, but the employees did not seem to care. So I waited another 15 minutes for tasteless cold food.  The person behind me had to give his dinner back because the chicken was raw.  The table next to me were complaining about how long it took to get their food- almost a half hour and this is at an airport where most people have time restraints.  Do not go to this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-spokane,,,,,
0,Hung N.,"Spokane, WA",28,71,100.0,3.0,2015-07-08,Good thing I arrived at the airport early! The people in front of me just got their food and when I was ready to order the person took my order and said it was take about 10 minutes. There weren't any other people behind me...I was literally the only person. It's like they turn their oven/stoves off after each order and have to hear them back up. It hardly takes me 8 minutes to make breakfast to feed my family. They really need to improve on their efficiency!  The food: I ordered the Classic Breakfast. It was quite tasty. The bacon was nice and crispy. The eggs were were a little overdone but not dry. The potatoes were better then I expected and seasoned well.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-spokane,,,,,
1,Guy D.,"Glendale, CA",0,104,18.0,1.0,2015-08-02,"So slow + Gross. Only try it if you have lots of time. I ordered the buffalo chicken salad. It took a long time to make (they are understaffed)...  The salad is pretty gross. White iceberg lettuce (the parts of the lettuce head you'd normally throw out). With heavily fried chicken ""patties"" as they called them... ""Throw another frozen chicken patty in the frier!"" To top it off, they cover your wilting white iceberg and freezer burnt patty with a ton of goopy blue cheese and hot sauce.  I am posting a photo... It is pretty gross. It is edible, but I think McDonald's is probably healthier... Which is frightening.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-too-spokane,,,,,
