13,Tod S.,"Cherokee, KS",29,227,288.0,3.0,2013-01-19,Had the shrimp tacos and they were good but the rice had no flavor to it at all. The red beans that came with it weren't very desirable either but overall it was a good experience. I will come back but won't order that again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-topeka,,,,,
0,IJudge Q.,"Topeka, KS",0,32,,3.0,2013-04-01,"Went with the neighbor for a dinner last week. He had the Grilled Chicken salad and it rated slightly above average. My wife had the Cajun Chicken Pasta and she gave it an average rating. I had the Memphis Dry Rub Ribs and they were very overcooked to the point of nearing the jerky classification. Service was adequate. Overall, an average experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-topeka,,,,,
11,Katie H.,"Lawrence, KS",43,202,30.0,3.0,2014-01-30,"I think my fiance and I have come to the understanding that Chili's is a good place to go to when we aren't wanting to travel too far (like Lawrence or KC) and aren't wanting to spend a lot of money on a decent meal. We've narrowed our likings down to the 2 for $20 deal, which is more than enough for the both of us. Just about every time I order the steak with steamed broccoli and mashed potatoes... Can't ever seem to go wrong with that! Side note: service is always way faster and the staff is more attentive (or so it seems) when you sit in the bar area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-topeka,,,,,
7,Lab L.,"Topeka, KS",0,217,,2.0,2014-01-31,"Yet another Topeka chain restaurant that does not live up to their brand standards. We were meeting a group for lunch and someone picked this place.  I was kind of excited since I hadn't lived near a Chili's in about 2 years. The table for 6 barely fit our group.  We were not comfortable and the two people at the open end almost had to eat on the corners. Many of the lunch specials involved 2 plates, plus my lunch special came with chips & salsa. The server was not good about removing the plates to give us  some wiggle room.  She did not refill the drinks.  Once we got the ticket (because one of our party needed to leave), the server totally disappeared.  Many of us were still eating....and we totally ran out of drinks.  Some wanted to-go containers and we had to flag down another server to help us. We won't be back to this location...and that's a shame considering there are a few things on the menu I like and it's convenient.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-topeka,,,,,
6,Grant E.,"Topeka, KS",4,39,13.0,2.0,2014-08-05,"The service was good.  But the food was...it was below average. Portion size for lunch was very small. We had the old timer deal and they fries were a skimpy portion and the burger was cooked almost beyond well-done. Little flavor, little juices.  Chips and salsa - they've changed their chips and it tastes like store bought hard tortilla chips.   Hardly ever eat at chain places like this and today was a reminder of why.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-topeka,,,,,
8,Steven J.,"Phoenix, AZ",52,355,242.0,1.0,2014-12-03,I used to like chilis? But the food is not good now. But most of all the bathrooms are dirty. Someone really should deep clean them including the walls.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-topeka,,,,,
10,Kaycee S.,"Shawnee, KS",0,9,,2.0,2015-01-01,"I made an online order for a 2 for $20 meal(s) to pick up on NYE for a specific pickup time. I was surprised by how many people had the same idea to take food to go. The car side area was packed with people waiting with little organization. I did have to wait for 45 min until my order was presented to me at which time one of the meals in my order was cold, sad and soggy. (Chicken Crispers) The other meal was excellent and to temperature. (6oz sirloin) The GM was on hand during this hectic evening and was friendly, apologetic for my wait and took extra time to address my food sensitivity when choosing a dipping sauce. Overall friendly service, crappy food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-topeka,,,,,
12,Jerry F.,"Brighton, CO",0,13,,4.0,2015-03-05,Had the all you want soup & salad. Outstanding. Wife had low calorie sirloin. It was all wonderful. Server had too many tables in bar area so was a little slow but good. Neat checkout with small screen at table to pay for meal and tip without the typical all at once sweet or attentive waiter finally paying attention to you for tip. We definitely will go back again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-topeka,,,,,
5,Mario R.,"Menifee, CA",1,6,1.0,2.0,2015-07-28,"This place used to be really good. Unfortunately, tonight was a let down. My tilapia cam out barely room temperature. My sisters food was all warm, not hot and fresh and my brother-in-laws fajitas were supposed to be medium rare. They came out well done. So sad to see a good place go down hill. Lesson learned.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-topeka,,,,,
9,Angela T.,"Topeka, KS",0,2,,5.0,2016-04-28,Kamiyah mya mack was an awesome waitress fast and courteous the food was scrumptious i try new items each visit i was in a hurry and my food came quick. Such a nice atmosphere !!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-topeka,,,,,
1,Rick G.,"Rossville, KS",23,5,,1.0,2016-07-18,"My wife reluctantly gave in to me and we went to Chili's this last weekend.  We have boycotted the place due to poor quality of food, bad service (Except in the bar area) and high prices!  When we got there I was hoping for a fresh start.  From the time we were seated till we finally left the place it was a total disaster.    For starters we were seated under an air conditioner duct which dripped condensation all over my wife.  We move ourselves to another booth to dry off.  After waiting several minutes the lady who does the bus work came up to us and said they could not find our waiter so she took our drink order.  The lady came back with our drinks and said that they were looking for our missing waiter so she took our food order to save some time.  My wife made her order and I ordered ""Bone in Buffalo Wings"".  I asked for them to be crispy and for the sauce to be cooked into them so they are not messy. We finally found the missing waiter and he brought our food.  He spent more time doing nothing than waiting on his 2 tables.  When I received my food I was not surprised, the wings were runny with their sauce, so much to the point it was hard for me to hold them.  I know this cause one slipped out of my fingers and landed on my new shirt! (Which is now ruined!)  As I tried to hold my temper and not blow my top and strangle someone, I tried to get thru the dinner and leave.  Once I finally started to eat the wings I about gagged.  They were so salty that I truly felt someone just dumped the salt on them not paying attention.  I mentioned this to our ""Crack Staff Waiter"" and all he could do was mumble something that resembled an apology.  This horrible experience cost us $29.93!  I paid it because I was dumb enough to thnk things might have changed!  NO TIP!  NEVER AGAIN!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-topeka,,,,,
4,Jenny R.,"Olathe, KS",8,39,11.0,3.0,2016-10-25,"We went to this Chili's location while in town for my daughter's soccer tournament.  The staff was fabulous!  They did a great job of interacting with 13 10 year olds and making them feel comfortable.  They worked well with the parents getting orders coordinated between us and our girls who were all sitting at different tables.  They did a tremendous job with a huge group of people.  The food is the only thing that was kind of blah.  Typically of Chili's.  Nothing fabulous, just an ok meal.  Kudos to the staff!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-topeka,,,,,
3,George S.,"Lyndon, KS",0,12,4.0,2.0,2017-01-02,No wait today as we came in for a late lunch . Quickly seated and drink order was taken. Our appetizer came rather quickly and the soup as well.  Food was prepared well and tasted good. Wait staff was forgetful had to ask twice for soda refills and water refills as well. Waitress tried to fill three water glasses with a half full pitcher and then had to be reminded to come back to top off the glasses...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-topeka,,,,,
2,Marlas C.,"Burlington, KS",0,8,1.0,4.0,2017-05-28,We had wonderful service and food was good. We had a big table and they were very accommodating to us all.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-topeka,,,,,
