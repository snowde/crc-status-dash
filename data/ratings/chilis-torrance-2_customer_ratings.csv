Their menu is what has deserved the higher tips until they made the mistake of removing their Vanilla Molten Ice Cream Cake from the menu in place of the Oreo one. Oreo is okay, but they *replaced* my favorite dessert. That was the reason I went to that restaurant.

251,Tony R.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",2,11,1.0,1.0,2013-01-12,"I've never been to a Chili's before, so I'm hoping that the others are better than this one.  This one sux! Let's start with some positives though.  Our family of four was seated immediately, so no wait at 7:45pm on a weeknight.  Also, our waitress was pretty quick to attend to our table, was friendly, and checked back frequently before we ordered and throughout our meal.  Seems like a pretty good start, right?  That's what I thought too, but by the end of the meal, I permanently crossed this place off of my list of eateries.  Where to start? ... My wife and I chose a meal pair that happened to come with a half-order of cheese fries.  Now, if you like cheese fries, and if you've ever had them at Islands, then you'll know roughly what I was expecting.  I asked for them crispy, and our waitress said that they always came out that way.  Instead, we got an order that was only 1/4 the size of Islands (barely enough for one person, let alone two), and the fries were totally soggy.  I hate fries that aren't crispy.  (In all fairness, these came with little bits of bacon sprinkled on top, and you don't get that at Islands.)  Next, a few of us asked for onion strings instead of french fries as sides for our burgers.  When the meals came out, they had fries instead.  No big deal, I figured we'll just get them replaced with onion strings.  Now look, restaurants make mistakes, and it's not a big deal.  What matters is how they handle the mistakes.  Any other restaurant where I've encountered a similar mistake, the waitress would just leave the mistaken side on your plate, and order the correct replacement.  Our waitress wanted to take back the entire order!  (Keep in mind, we're hungry and don't want to wait while our meals are re-prepared).  I object, and offer to move the fries onto a different plate so we can keep our burgers.  (For any wait-staff reading this, this would have been the waitresses second chance to just say ""oh don't worry about it, just hang on to those fries for the trouble of the mistake, and I'll go get your onion strings as well."")  So, she takes away our fries (perhaps they need to count the mistaken fries in the back?).  Geez! So, I dig into the burger.  BTW, I didn't want a dry burger, so I specifically asked them to not cook the burger to the default of medum-well, but at the time I ordered I asked for medium instead.  However, what I ended up with was the dryest hocky-puck of a burger that I've had in a long time -- perhaps ever.  Small too!  With paper-thin bacon!  And this was a $12 burger!   BTW, I asked for some ranch the server that brought our food (not our waitress) for a side of ranch.  You guessed it -- it never arrived. Well, at least I have my onion-strings to look forward to, right?  Wrong.  Once the O-strings arrived (ten minutes later, after everyone had already finished their meals), these things were the saltiest food items I've ever encountered.  Perhaps the cook was pissed that he got the order wrong and he doused them with salt, but both baskets of O-strings were literally inedible.  So, we tossed those aside.   The kids wanted one of the delicious-looking deserts, but after pouring that much $ into a disappointing meal, I drew the line and asked for the check. So, for you bottom-line / summary folks: PROs: - Fast seating; - Friendly waitress, checked on us frequently, and refilled our drinks on a regular basis even though she had several other big tables; - Bacon bits on the cheese fries; - My wife liked her chicken salad. CONs - Mistaken order, and the waitress didn't ""do the right thing"" to make it right; - Tiny portions; - Small hockey-puck burger; - When they did correct the order, it took forever, and the onion-strings were the saltiest things on the planet! - Server failed to bring dressing; Bottom line:  Poor value for the $.  One star. Epilogue: The manager held the door open for us on the way out and wished us a nice night.  What he didn't say was ""How was your meal?""  Perhaps he already knew the answer he was going to get.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-torrance-2?start=260,2.6,2.6,2.6,2.436,2.6

Then after delivering our appetizer, he did not provide us with napkins or silverware. I then got up from our table to get the things we needed myself. He then got one of my daughters orders wrong and took a while to correct it and it was just corn which I'm sure was already done.  My daughters burger was way overdone and my other daughters Kraft mac and cheese was poorly made. It then took a while for our last two entrees to arrive which were just ok. We then ordered dessert to go and it took over 10 minutes for him to come back at all. In the meantime, he never brought our check.  When he did finally come back, he still didn't have our check!  The topper is that instead of immediately going to get our check after all of that time, he was two tables over taking their order!!!!!  I then had to get up to ask another server for our check to pay the bill.

Safe to say this place is losing alot of good paying customers quickly... We went here during a weekday a few weeks back to have drinks and just some late night conversation. Closing time was probably in an hour and the bar was fairly empty so we had plenty of time. We had a young black waitress who was really nice..almost a little too nice. While we were seated she kept having pretty inappropriate conversation with the two older gentleman behind us including showing her Facebook page & other things I'd rather not say on Yelp... When we got our food (girlfriend order enchiladas & I ordered shrimp tacos), our places were COMPLETELY covered in grease! SInce our plates both came with rice it was clear they cooked the majority of all the food in the same batch of grease. Here comes the worse part.. When we told our waitress about the problem (we had a napkin soaked clearly in nothing but grease), she stated she would get the manager. We were confused as to why? We just didn't want the order we just wanted to return the plate. The manger came over and made the one statement that will be the reason I will never eat at this particular Chili's again.. ""So did you need another reason for your order?"" Excuse the f**k out of me??? Are you asking me why I need a reason to return an order that was clearly cooked poorly????? Luckily I was in the bathroom when he came otherwise they would have needed 911. He gave my girlfriend attitude until I got back. He told her ""Well we cook our enchiladas in grease and this is how they normally come"". Umm no, we have had this dish several times and its NEVER looked that bad. You can also cook enchiladas without grease as well. He finally tucked in his pride and said I'm sorry after a few more verbal jabs. We had to wait several minutes for the order to be taken off the bill before we finally could leave. We went to somewhere we know the service is always the same: In-N-Out I am sadly disappointed. I have only decided to start doing reviews after having several recent incidents like this.

69,Kelli S.,"Honolulu, HI",1902,1170,9782.0,3.0,2014-11-19,"My experience at this Chili's has been rather hit-and-miss. The first time I went was for lunch on a Sunday; the eatery wasn't crowded and we experienced prompt service and great food. When I went once on a Saturday night for dinner, the restaurant was packed and service was a bit slower, but it wasn't bad. However, on a different Saturday when I went for dinner with a group of people, we experienced the worst service ever -- I don't think we even left a tip that night. Our waitress filled one of our water glasses only halfway because she ran out of water in her pitcher ... and she didn't return! We had to flag her down to ask for more water (as well as for our other needs). Not cool.   However, I have to say that the food quality has been consistent at this location, so though I don't know what to expect now when it comes to service, I can pretty much be safe that my usual entrees and desserts will be good.   Here are some of my favorites when it comes to ordering at Chili's:   ""Chocolate Chip Cookie Skillet"": This Pizookie knock-off was delicious, and I usually opt for this sweet treat whenever I need a break from my usual ""Molten Cake"" order. This dessert features a soft, warm, chocolate chip cookie fresh out of the oven--served in one of those iron skillets--and it's topped with vanilla ice cream and hot fudge. I think I've had a peanut butter version of this cookie before, which was amazing, but the chocolate chip version is still good. The cookies I've received have always been soft and tender, pairing perfectly with the luscious vanilla ice cream and warm hot fudge.  ""Buffalo Chicken Ranch Sandwich"": If I'm in the mood to order a sandwich at Chili's, I go for this savory combo. The ""Buffalo Chicken Ranch Sandwich"" features crispy chicken (same as the chicken in the ""Boneless Buffalo Chicken Salad"") topped with spicy Buffalo sauce, a fresh-sliced tomato, lettuce and the eatery's homemade ranch dressing. The sandwich is served with French Fries; I love the extra saltiness the fries at Chili's seem to have. I can only handle mildly spicy dishes, so this sandwich was pushing it for me (I had to drink lots of water during/after my meal), but I enjoyed it nonetheless!   ""Seasonal Desserts"": Be on the lookout for current, seasonal offerings at Chili's, because some of these limited-time specials have been some of my favorites. The ""Chocolate Peanut Butter Molten"" in particular is noteworthy--I wish it were a regular on the restaurant menu. It's probably my favorite molten. This ""Chocolate Peanut Butter Molten"" featured a moist peanut butter-chocolate molten cake topped with vanilla ice cream and chocolate and caramel sauce drizzles. Generous chunks of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups--my favorite candy--topped off this dessert. And, of course, a melted peanut butter center was at the cake's core. This is simply chocolate-peanut butter heaven.  ""Southwestern Mac 'n' Cheese"": Though this dish is just a side, it might be worth substituting for one of the other sides in your entrée (slight extra fee) or just ordering on the side if you're a serious mac 'n cheese lover. This dish is definitely heavy on the cheese (the macaroni itself is cheesy, with the cheese oozing out of every bite) and the breadcrumbs on top add extra savoriness. It's one of my favorite mac 'n cheeses.  ""Boneless Buffalo Chicken Salad"": This salad is my go-to entrée at Chili's, as it's one of my favorite salads ever. It features a medley of wild greens (spring mix), crispy boneless chicken tossed in the eatery's spicy Buffalo sauce, applewood smoked bacon, bleu cheese crumbles, homemade pico de gallo, crispy tortilla strips and homemade ranch dressing. I always get this salad without pico and with extra bleu cheese crumbles (I love my cheese). I also ask for the dressing on the side (I've found that, if you do, you'll sometimes end up with more dressing). I've noticed also that, in recent years, the greens in this salad are now a spring mix/wild greens ... and though they aren't my favorite (I don't like the bitter purple lettuce), the toppings on this salad--the strongly flavored bleu cheese with the mildly spicy boneless chicken strips--are worth it.  ""Molten Chocolate Cake"": When there isn't a seasonal ""Molten Cake"" that I want to try, this ""Molten Chocolate Cake"" always gets my dessert vote. It features a moist, warm chocolate cake with a melted chocolate center and is topped with vanilla ice cream surrounded by a thin chocolate shell. The contradicting mixtures in this one dessert make it so fun (and challenging) to eat. I always enjoy sopping up the cake pieces in the gooey chocolate mixture oozing out from the center, while trying to simultaneously eat the ice cream and hard chocolate topping without the ice cream melting completely because of the cake's warmth!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-torrance-2?start=40,2.52,2.83,2.83,2.0600000000000005,2.7060000000000004

You have to ask for the chili as it isn't listed on the menu, there are a lot more Tex-Mex items and there is this new electronic device similar to an Ipad or computer that takes your payment at the end. The table side guacamole is good and the chicken fajitas can have corn tortillas swapped for flour.

That outta tell you something? Got seated and no one came to greet our table, 10mins later, one server noticed! She apologized for the wait. But it's not her fault. She must felt overwhelmed with the tables she already had and then one more to add! There needs to be more bodies on the floor. service is key! And this place needs improvement!

Annnnd it pretty much hasn't changed, except they no longer sell/serve the Awesome Blossom! That was probably the best thing in the menu! Apparently they stopped it in 2008.. So that leads me to believe they've been lame for about 7 years now. All jokes aside, the food was alright, and the price was right.... We Ordered the 2 for $20 lunch/dinner special. It comes with an appetizer and two entrees. We ordered the guac and chips. Guac was good, a little to chunky for my taste. The salsa it comes with is a shame, pure salt. The chips may be made in house, or they just serve em' warm. We got a bacon cheeseburger with onion rings and chicken strips with fries. Their sides are a decent size, the onion rings are anyway. My daughter had, a quesadilla, with mashed potatoes and a chocolate milk, gross I know, but she's 7 so it makes sense to her. .. The food came out promptly, our server was kinda mia after that. We ordered another order of fries and he showed at the table to give us the check and then remembered we never got the fries. We didn't even want em' anymore but it's not a huge deal, so yeah.  All in all $36. No too bad for 3 peeps. We had to waited maybe ten minutes to be seated, which is to be expected on a busy Saturday during the lunch rush. -1 because they don't have the awesome blossom and -1 because of the whole fry/MIA mishap.

My fiancé and I went to this location for dinner today and had the worst experience. We started off with drinks (he had an unsweetened Iced tea and I ordered a Grapefruit Margarita) and appetizers (chips and salsa & cheese fries). We got the drinks first then the chips and salsa. We were starving so it went fast especially the salsa. Our server disappeared so we didn't get a chance to ask for more. Another server brought out our cheese fries so we asked him to bring another order of chips and salsa but he told us he'd tell our server. We waited and nothing came. The Texas cheese fries were good but certainly were starting to get cold. The fries weren't fresh and the cheese was already solid. I let that go. But then our entrees came. We both ordered steak medium rare. When we got our orders my finance's was clearly well done and mine was medium. When our server finally reappeared she asked us how everything was. My fiancé told her his steak was overcooked but declined to have another one re-cooked and just told her as an FYI. He asked for A1 sauce. Halfway through my meal I noticed that at the bottom of the broccoli stems there was black spotted mold covering the bottoms. I quickly stopped eating and my fiancé asked to speak to a manager. A young man came over and we explained the steak and my broccoli. He offered to have them re-done or if we wanted to order something else. I had lost my appetite by then so we declined. He took away our entrees and soon after the waitress came over and brought us a bill. My fiancé was livid that we were still expected to pay for the rest of the meal after that disgusting moldy broccoli. We asked our server for the manager and instead of the same guy it was another woman with glasses. She came over asking if she can help us with a smart attitude straight off the bat. We had to explain the entire situation again and she preceded to tell me that they get their produce delivered fresh everyday. Her tone was very matter-of-fact and she did not bother to examine the plate that we had returned. I was livid! I told her I have seen moldy vegetables in my life and that broccoli was not fresh! She then began to barrage us with her reasoning behind charging us for the rest of our meal. Stating we had enjoyed everything else and if we wanted another steak entree in exchange she would have to charge us. Why the hell would you try charging us for this incredibly disgusting experience and make us feel like we were lying about their bad produce. I could not take any more of her rude tone and her unprofessional way of handling the whole situation. I felt extremely dissatisfied as a long time customer and would have preferred better treatment from this ""manager."" She was not understanding or personable at all.

First off, I feel like there was only one waiter managing the tables in the bar section. The rest of the restaurant was almost empty, I think I saw one family sitting down in the dine in area. If it's full in the bar, why can't other waiters help out? So of course our waiter Zach is getting piled with orders and refills and forgetting this and that. So what happened was we asked if we can have extra sour cream for our nachos and he tells us it's .90 extra, it was really .80 extra but anyways we agreed because we still wanted it. Well he gets side tracked and passes us more than 5 times and even tells us once while passing by us that he's gunna get our sour cream. We waited for ten minutes for the sour cream and when we get it, it is the smallest dollop of sour cream I couldn't even believe it. I was led to believe that since we were paying almost a dollar extra that we would get almost a whole side of sour cream. No, we were wrong. The sour cream came in the same small container the ranch comes in. I was so disappointed that at that point I didn't even feel like finishing my food. Sure, I could be over reacting but when you're really hungry and looking forward to enjoying your food, this just spoils it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-torrance-2?start=120,2.08,2.53,2.53,2.248,2.35

Things started out pretty good but then long waits, I am talking like 15 minutes before returning. She didn't check on things. She didn't bring the soup or salad before the food. We had to ask. Let's back the chili pepper up a bit. Even when we got seated the first lady that took us to the table didn't even wait for us to sit down. The reason why I say that is the seat was dirty with food and crumbs. I will give them credit, the cup if chili was actually good. They did bring an extra dressing for the salad. The chili did have a lot if cheese grated on top. Bravo. The plate that the ribs were served on was dirty with stuck on cilantro and the edge was greasy or burnt cheese. Now that I think about it my fork was dirty. The salad was not crisp. It looked like it was old. The corn on the cob was just plain cold. It looks all smashed, mushy, and dry to boot. She took my straw when bringing a new glass with a refill. The new smoked chicken burrito was so plain I couldn't taste any of the advertised sauce. The chicken was just so soft I wondered how it was supposed to be grilled. I had to put my chili on the burrito to spice it up. I tried to ask for hot sauce but the server did not return for so long.

We weren't offered, but should have taken the hint.  The wait staff all seemed busy with a lot of large groups; we got greeted then left to sit.  The manager saw that we were just sitting there, so took our order and fast tracked it ahead of the groups. Whew! Kudos to him. Food arrived in about 15 minutes, so that's 30 minutes since stepping foot in the door. For a burger and a soup/salad lunch.  The Southwest(?) burger and fries looked good and was fresh and hot.  The wife's soup was only warm, the salad looked good, but nothing extraordinary.  We were done in another 15 and tried to use the on-table screen to check out--and found a 99 cent charge for table entertainment (games). We had scrolled through the food menus while waiting and saw that games were available. But, didn't see any warning about a charge until AFTER hitting the play button, at which time we backed out of that screen, without playing. So, another wait while the waitress had the  manager remove the charge.  Beware of getting sucked in to that charge! It should be free, to fill the wait time (hint!)

But this one take out experience ruined it for me and I doubt we'll return. First of all, I thought it was curbside pickup (like they bring it to you). I guess I was mistaken but I have a baby so I was hoping this would be convenient. So I had to go inside, fine. I lugged the 25+ lb car seat inside. The pickup is all the way in the back of the bar area. I had 2 entrees and 2 drinks. The girl rings me up and opens the food to check it. My friends entree (lunch sliders and fries) literally had 5 fries. Even the girl was a little surprised and mumbled something about the box being too big. I even asked her if she was SURE that's all the fries I get. Her response was ""the manager packed it. If she packed it she would have given me more fries."" Ok. Yet she didn't do anything about it. So now I have a carseat, a bag of food, and 2 drinks. No one offers to help me so I had to make 2 trips, one to drop off the baby in the car and actually leave him in there while I run back for the drinks. It was 15 seconds sure but a little help would have been nice avoided me leaving him. I was so embarrassed bringing lunch to my friend with the 5 fries. I actually apologized for it.

I got the chicken fajita 3 for me deal and my one friend got the mix and match fajita shrimp and steak. She always gets the same thing. My other friend got the chicken crispers. Now my friend that ordered the mix and match is allergic to cilantro and onions make her sick so when ordering she requested only bell peppers and to add jalapenos. About 10 minutes later the server returned to announce that unfortunately the cook made the mix and match with both cilantro and onions but he caught it and had them remake it. He brought her some chips and salsa to make up for the mistake. She was ok with that. 10 minutes later he brought her meal out. After leaving it she noticed it still had cilantro and onions. She called him over and we could see he felt terrible,  he apologized profusely and offered to remake it again. She said no that she would eat around it she was hungry. He offered to remove the meal from the bill and offered a free desert of her choice which eased her annoyance alot. He was very attentive and on top of it. Sadly the cooks were not.

The guys at the front was pretty helpful and said he would write us down and try to seat us soon. After waiting 30 minutes, we asked again and someone who seemed like the manager said she would look and see what she could do. After another 20 minutes, we were getting ready to leave. We were a party of 8 with 3 young kids who were getting very hangry. Finally we got seated, but most of our party was not happy. I felt sorry for the person who would get stuck as our server. Our servers name was Cameron and she came in like a ray of sunshine. While some of our party started to give her some attitude, she was a great sport.  Apologizing for our wait, but not making excuses.  She was friendly and attentive, helpful in suggesting menu items and  prompt on the refills (which is my pet peeve). I don't know if we were hungry, but the food was great and super affordable. Their prices were definitely better than most.  So what looked like was going to be a debacle of a night, turned out great.  At then end of the night, our whole party was enjoying the food and all was forgotten.

Seriously, we started with our drink orders and it looked promising since our server told us there would be three people taking care of us, but we only saw the initial guy for the first 40 minutes or so and only very briefly. It took forever to get the first round of drinks (water, soda and iced tea) so as soon as they came we insisted on ordering our food right then.  At other locations our appetizers come out very quickly, but at this one after 15 minutes we had to flag someone down to check on them. Chips and salsa has always come out instantly at other locations, but not here.  Also, some of us ordered alcoholic drinks when the server brought our water but those took forever as well and when they finally arrived, they did not bring straws so we waited for another several minutes before I just got up and asked another server for some. You would think the straws were made of gold or something because at first he refused to give us any. He kept telling us they were in our little packet, but I had to explain a few times that we all got water and other drinks and we used our straws for those, then I kept thinking, why the heck is this an issue?!?!  When he finally relented and pulled some straws from the pack around his waist, they looked like they had been in there for months. The ends were black with dirt and holey and as I recoiled from them, I asked if we could please get some that were not partially open. I figured he could see the dirty part without me having to point that out (but I guess you never know!).  So who knows how much later, we finally started getting our entrees. In our party of eight, four of us ordered fajitas. Only one of us got sour cream on our little condiment boat so guess what took even more time? Waiting for that damn sour cream, so we looked around and tried to see if there was literally anything else we might need so we could ask for it now in hopes that we would get it before we were done. Yes, it was that bad. Also, pro tip here. If you are getting the 2 for $22 and you want chips and salsa, order the guacamole and chips instead. You'll get the guac, the salsa and the chips. Trust me, someone will eat it and it's not costing you any more. I will still eat at Chili's from time to time, but definitely not at this location. I don't think I would make it out before my social security kicks in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-torrance-2?start=40,3.0,2.51,2.668,2.184,2.7060000000000004

Evidently there was a going to be a wait for a table but there was a spot in the bar area available, so bar here I come. There was a tablet kiosk on the table which seemed to have lots of options but no option to order food. The server came by shortly and I ordered from the paper menu. The Grass-Fed Sunrise Burger is one of their new 'craft' burgers. It comes with a beef patty, from cattle that were presumably grass fed. There is a ""cage-free fried egg"" on top of the patty, sunny side up, and presumably it was the chicken that was raised cage free and not the fried egg. In addition there was pepper jack cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, and 'Chili's Signature sauce'. The first bite into the burger left egg yolk running down my hand, a bit of a mess. I can't really use the right words here but the total effect was the creation of an average burger. It just doesn't end up being that special. Good, but not great. French Fries were served in a metal basket. They were a little on the salty side, for my taste. The server was conscientious to the point that when she noticed my Diet Coke was down about one inch came out with a second one, perhaps just anticipating that I would eventually want more soda. The bar area has lots of televisions tuned to sporting events. It was quite noisy at first, especially the ladies near me who had been drinking a bit, but the noise level eventually settled down to a more acceptable level.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-torrance-2,2.84,2.53,2.656,2.38,2.654

I had an Angry Apple Orchard beer. First of all, it took way too long to get a beer that was flat and and warm.... After waiting a while for our food, one would imagine it would at least be hot.. This was not the case. My ribs were dry and appeared to have been sitting much like a poorly executed banquets set up. The corn was dried out to where you could see the husk of the corn through the collection of kernels. This link that had cheese in it which seemed like a good idea at when I ordered it. Not to mention I didn't even get my fries that came with the order. I had to tell another server about it since mine obviously had to cover a large section by himself. Usually, I take it in stride since I'm a former industry guys, but that night around 12 I woke up having to Run to the bathtoom. I was vometing and suffering from diarrhea...

Ribs and chicken were good but the BBQ on the chicken didn't fit my pallet. Fries were under avg. and the bread was a bit too salty. Wait staff was pretty attentive so I gave 3 instead of 2. I think I'll stick with the fajitas next time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-torrance-2?start=20,2.56,2.6,2.628,2.604,2.584

We have never complained BUT tonight it was so bad that I have to speak up. we ordered the dinner special for 2 for $22. I ordered chicken fajitas and my son ordered Hamburger. My chicken fajitas was OLD DEAD CHICKEN microwaved. It smelled like hell. My son's Hamburger was so bad that he could not finish it. BTW, My son loves Hamburger. He eats any kind of Hamburger. Imagine how bad his hamburger was that he could not finish it.  The manager comes over and he apologized for the Microwaved Dead Chicken and he admits how horrible my food was. I asked him to charge us for the drinks and we will go to In-N-Out. Hold and be-hold the bill arrives with 50% discount. That's where I lost it. Not only the people in the kitchen are worthless but the manager is too. Now I know what is wrong. THEY DON'T CARE. they finally only charged us for the drinks and we left.

Solid good food, friendly staff, lively loud environment. A fun place, just a little too loud for me, during peak hours. Ribs and a variety of BBQ meats are the stars here. Great meat, through out the menu, as entress, in  sandwiches, sliders, nachos and even in appetizers. They have great salads for your veggie friends. The jalapeño chicken enchiladas are hit, spicy and yummy....my current favorites. I also love their soups. They have great deals 2 for $20, 2 for $29 and other specials. Sometimes sharing makes the meal all the more delish.  Don't neglect the desserts, as they have a wicked, yummy way with chocolate.
