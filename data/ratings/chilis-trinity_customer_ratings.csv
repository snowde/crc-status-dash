22,Dianna B.,"Tarpon Springs, FL",848,2344,2390.0,3.0,2013-08-09,"Since i'm following a low carb diet, eating out is a challenge.  I wanted something that I didn't cook for a change! I was out at Target on 54 & Little road, and decided, I'm going to try Chili's, since they have a ""Lighter Side menu"". The husbeast, the bestie and I were seated without any preamble and waited only a few minutes for our waitress to come by and offer us our drinks, which we quickly placed.  For dinner, each of us chose something off the Lighter Side, I got the Grilled Chicken Salad, the bestie got the Talipa, but opted to have the rice subbed out for more broccoli, and all the sauces on the side, and the Husbeast got the shrimp tacos.   Everything came out just as we ordered. Sauces that were ordered on the side, came on the side. Substitutions that were asked for, were made. This impressed me because honestly, this usually gets screwed up.  And all the food off this special menu was very tasty.  The only reason I'm only giving 3 stars is because the service was -s-l-o-w-.  We wanted to cash out, but there was one waitress who was just chatting with a couple at the end of her station for over 20 minutes, and the manager had to come and cut her off.  Our waitress delivered our check, and then disappeared for over 8 minutes.  We were on some what of a schedule so this set us back considerably when we already had the money set to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-trinity?start=20,2.604,2.604,2.604,2.604,2.604

First, I love the fact that they have call ahead seating....kind of like reservations, but 20 minutes in advance.  We called and when we walked in, we were seated immediately.  My sincere apologies to the people that came in before us and had to wait 30 minutes. We frequent this Chili's and service is usually good.  On this occasion it was very slow...drink refills and chips n salsa took forever.  Our server never stopped back during dinner. The dinner itself was good.  My big mouth bites were tasty and grilled perfectly.  My wife's buffalo chicken salad was delicious.  And, did I mention the ranch. Except for the service, this could be a five star for me...But it was a bit of a rough visit because of that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-trinity?start=20,2.508,2.508,2.508,2.508,2.508

It came with a appealingly nice salad from the initial looks of it, however, it was mostly iceberg lettuce once I picked out a few greens that were on top. The citrus balsamic vinaigrette was good however. The taste and flavor of the chicken in my main meal was very flavorful and the salsa was tasty as well. My husband got a half sandwich and salad. It was turkey and cheese and it was quite good but a little on the greasy side.

No sizzle on the platter like previous visits. Maybe they have gone to microwave food? Waitress is now only a food runner. Orders taken from a tablet on table which charged us $1. On our bill plus a 20% tip for waitress.  Unlimited chips salsa is limited to the # of x u can find server. Chili's seems like more of a fast food place now. U order & pay from a tablet.

We didnt go to the closer one just bc the last horrible visit. Ok let me stop venting lol. We ordered take out from this location last week because it was late and nothing else was open. My girlfriend ordered a California turkey club and I got  shrimp, steak and chicken fajitas. The bacon on the turkey club was almost rare and the shrimp on the fajitas were hard and disgusting plus they forgot the side of rice and beans so I called to let them know. They told us they would credit us both entrées the next time we come so we decided to order it tonight. Placed the order at 915 got there at 10 and they said they person who took the order gave it to the wrong customer and would take 20 min for a new one.

It was fairly busy and an older woman that was waaay too happy waited on us unfortunately. I had my go-to the Buffalo Ranch Chicken Sandwich. My dates had the chicken fingers and appetizer sampler. The sliders sucked, the chicken tenders definitely had a wang to them. Like they used fish fry instead of chicken batter. I am not a fan of Chili's anyway but I figured I would give it a try since calories don't count on vacay;) I wanna like the Chili's chain but everything seems so greasy and salty.

My son ordered the kids pizza which was a different recipe which he didn't care for. The waitress recommended the 'explosion salad' which came with cheese quesadilla. The salad tasted like they sprinkled dishwater dressing on it. The quesadilla also had the same sort of dirty flavor. The unsweetened ice tea was super cloudy.

35,Kimberly K.,"Port Richey, FL",0,1,,1.0,2016-01-30,"I love Chili's restaurant, but both experiences I've had at this location were awful. I went here a few months ago for lunch with a coworker and the food was awful. I ordered from the lunch menu, a double cheeseburger and it was dry and overcooked. The bun and fries were both cold, it was just terrible and I didn't eat 2/3 of it. Took the leftovers home and gave to my pit bull, he loved it however. So last night my husband and I gave it another shot. We knew we'd have a wait ahead of us, being Friday night and all. Hostess told us 30 minutes at least. No biggie, totally expected it. Once we were seated, our waiter came and took our drink order. It arrived in about 10 minutes. We were busy looking over the menu and didn't mind. Then we placed our appetizer order and waited. And waited. And waited. 20 minutes later the waiter came out, apologized for the wait, took our meal order and assured us our apps were coming ""right out"". Another 25 minutes and still no apps. Our meal came out, no app...we never got our apps. My husband's steak was dry and had strange sandy like texture inside. I took my chicken home and ate it the next morning so I can't really review that meal since it sat in the fridge overnight before I ate it. We paid the check, including the apps we never received  (my husband doesn't like to complain or make a scene at all) and got outta there. I'll never go back to this location, I'll stick with the Port Richey or Tarpon locations. It's an extra drive but way better service and taste. The only good thing about this location is the sweet little calico kitten that greets you as you're walking to the door. He's a stray, but looks surprisingly healthy...guess he gets a lot of leftovers from this location...just like my pit bull.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-trinity?start=20,,,,,

My favorites are the Ancho Salmon (cal. 590) and 6oz Sirloin with Grilled Avocado (cal.410). Extra star to Chili on the Salmon, outside of a few seafood restaurants, I am not a big fan of eating seafood at certain places but they did it perfect. Not dry, falls off the fork and perfect color and taste. Bacon burger, my son recommends also reasonably priced.

My husband, my daughter and I had already figured out what drinks, appetizer, and entrees we wanted. I noticed people being sat after us already had drinks and put in there food orders so I asked a server where our server was she claimed she had food to run and argued with my husband about it, the restaurant wasn't busy enough for it to take her 20 minutes to run food (I have worked for restaurants since I was 16), once she came to the table I realized I hadn't even seen her ""running food"". We had already told the pervious server our drink order, well apparently the message wasn't relayed (which wasn't a big deal) we decided that it may take forever for our food to come out so we didn't order an appetizer.

As for the food, we split the Big Mouth Bites (chili version of slider, 4=1640) and Fried Pickles (670 cals) which were forgettable as the market screams them these days. Ordinary mini buns and less that quality ground beef will not reach the bar. I looked around the table and all I could think of was ""bar food gone bad!""
