Went with family in a group of seven.  Ordering was slow, food came out at different times, drinks and ""bottomless"" appetizers were left unfilled and with bottoms showing, respectively.  Worse was that the ribs were basically bones held together with a bare minimum of meat.  ""Bony meat crisps"" is a more appropriate name that ""baby back ribs"".  My wife had the soup and salad.  The soup was more melted cheese, which is cool if you like that.  But three of us had indigestion after eating.

27,Ashley A.,"San Diego, CA",4,5,,5.0,2013-12-06,My boyfriend and I went here before a family function. We traveled from San Diego where we live. After the almost seven hour drive we went in for a much needed drink. Our server was Desiree. She was super upbeat. Most servers would be annoyed that we didn't order food- taking up their section for a lousy tip for two drinks. Instead she joked with us and we felt very welcomed. I understand that this is a company chain but Desiree did not act like a robotic commercial server. I don't write a lot of reviews but give credit where credit is due. Desiree is a great asset to this company.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tucson-4?start=20,2.9320000000000004,2.9320000000000004,2.9320000000000004,2.9320000000000004,2.932000000000001

Then it took 10 minutes for us to be acknowledged. Once we finally got our food it was mediocre at best. And what happened to the ribs? They were bones being held together by tiny, dried out slivers of meat. And the cinnamon apples that came with them were cold. Well some were cold others were not, which lead me to believe they were microwaved. Not one employee in the whole place seemed to have any urgency or care to satisfy the customer. I will NOT be going back to this restaurant. It really seemed as if someone or something had sucked all the hope out of the place. I really don't see how they stay open.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tucson-4?start=20,2.404,2.404,2.404,2.404,2.404
28,Ellen G.,"Green Valley, AZ",6,16,,1.0,2014-02-12,"At this Chili''s I can usually count on them to be mediocre at best, but my  last visit there lowered their bar considerably. Every item I ordered was awful if not inedible, but when I informed our server, Brandon, he proceeded to argue with us that the Queso really was supposed to be dried out and lacking cheese with a burnt smell. We spent a lot of time talking with the manager about our complete disappointment. He was very nice, but I feel he could have handled the situation in a better way. The four of us ordered the $20 meals for two, and two of us got the crispy chicken strips. They were so gristly and over cooked I could not even tear them apart with my hands, much less eat them. Even the appetizer was greasy and gross. I sent my meal back and asked that my meal and hers be removed from the check. Instead of just removing it, the manager gave us some mumbo-jumbo about giving us 50% off both meals for two, when just removing ours would have made more sense. The check was a mess, still charging us for the Queso we sent back and we were charged for our terrible appetizer. Also, the manager had asked if they could get me anything else in a way of compensation for our bad experience. Since it was 3 in the afternoon and I still hadn't eaten, I suggested a bacon cheeseburger to go. When the check came I had been charged for the burger. Complaining again to the manager, I suggested that he take the burger back, but he said to keep it and removed it from the check. When I arrived home and started to eat the burger that was wrapped in foil, I found it was a sloppy mess with no top bun.....I assume an act of revenge from some disgruntled employee. I would suggest that you take your business elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-tucson-4?start=20,,,,,

We got the Texas cheese fries and the first order we got had obviously been made, left sitting then thrown under the broiler to be reheated we could tell because the cheese was burnt but the fries where cold. When I asked the waitress over before I could even say anything she went ""woah those aren't right"" and then she took them away to get them fixed but then 3 minutes later the manager came over and lectured me that that's just how they melt the cheese and that's how they are supposed to be which I know isn't true because I've had them many many times before and they are always gooey and delicious and when I pointed out that there weren't supposed to be onions on it he insisted there where supposed to be green onions on there and that I was wrong when I pointed to the grilled white onions (the ones that go on fajitas) he said ""oh those must've fallen on there"" and then when we got our meals my partner's  steaks was cold in the middle and was still raw then he order it medium.

Our food took nearly 45 minutes to arrive. We ordered an appetizer; it arrived burnt and seconds before our actual main course.  Chili's is normally a fall back place when trying to get a quick bite for dinner. This restaurant needs improvement.

Husband had a margarita he said was good I had a Tito's something and it was yummy.  We had the guacamole & chips appetizer and the guac was really good and fresh.

I don't have exact time but it seemed longer than usual for our waiter to come introduce himself. He was kind. The food was ok. Nothing spectacular but better than a fast food place. A tad salty for my personal taste buds.  The restaurant is dirty! I realized this halfway through my meal. The menus and tables were sticky.

For our entrees, my husband had the sirloin steak with loaded mashed potatoes and broccoli.  The steak was on the smaller side (you can purchase a larger steak for a bit more), but the quantity of potatoes and vegetables were huge.  I ordered the bacon cheeseburger and fries.  The burger was cooked perfectly and a very generous size.   The menu has plenty of options..  There are a lot of sandwiches, salads, Mexican meals, and steak dishes to choose from. I was disappointed with the service and the overall cleanliness of the restaurant.  Our friend had to ask for someone to wipe down the table.  It was extremely sticky.  There were also several dead flies in the window sill.  The service was also lacking.  Our friends had to ask a few times for their diet cokes.  I am not sure if they were understaffed and or she was just having a bad day, but I wasn't impressed.
