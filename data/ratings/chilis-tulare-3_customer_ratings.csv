At  55 years of age I have eaten at a lot of places in the United States.

The Broccoli was so salty and the mashed potatoes were so cold the cheese didnt melt..

As far as carbon copy menus go, they keep there's the most consistent, and my favorite location by far is this one in Tulare.  When I'm down visiting family, it's imperative to me that we find a good meal that satisfies all our eclectic tastes. Twenty pages+ of menu items, drink refills before you even take a sip, TV's at every angle and kiosks loaded with video games for the nephews are just a few of the many conveniences. Dig into their buffalo chicken sandwich or classic nachos and you've got yourself the best quality controlled meal in city limits.

Always ask for well done and I get the Pink- est bloodiest meat ever. How do I make my 9 year old suck it up and eat it anyways ? I dont. Waste of money.  I mean blood started oozing out before I even cut it with the knife. I know many like their steaks that way and that's fine. But not this gal. So what do I get? 12 and 18 dollar meals not eaten. I mean if they can't read a monitor where it says well done. I will be more than happy to come teach them to read. Not to mention pickup time was 830 and I waited till 9 for anyone to even come talk to me. I even rang the bell. After sitting there for 20 minutes having multiple employees walk by and look at me not asking if I have been helped. Some rude employee comes out and gives someone their order that came in after me!after I was waiting forever as is. You're  kidding me! But told me to ""hold on "" to make me wait that extra 15. . All my food was cold and hard by the time it got here. Luckily my kids are troopers and managed to make Do. But definitely feel it was a waste of money. Especially on father's day! So if you like your order wrong cold or not even there....come to chilis.! Not they suck ! So say I've ordered 50 meals from here ..

We waited an unusually long time for someone to take our beverage order. Eventually, a server stops and asked if we had been helped. When we responded that we have not, instead of apologizing she deflected with, ""Well I told him you were here. I guess I can help you."" I felt that was just unprofessional and unnecessary to involve the customer in her annoyance with her coworkers. I ordered the bottomless soup and salad which also comes with chips & salsa.  My salad was delivered to the table bus different staff member. I inquired about the status of the chips & salsa.  Our server promptly returned with the tray of chips & salsa and then asked ""You want chips & salsa too?"" I then clarified that they came with the soup and salad. She proceeded to argue with me that I didn't specify that I wanted the ""bottomless"" and since that's not what I ordered do I still want the chips? I insisted that she leave the chips and change my order to the bottomless option. In addition to the above, our drinks were never refilled for the duration of our meal.

Today was a very important dinner for me, it turned out to be the worst experience I've had here. The final time I step foot into this restaurant.  The place was relatively empty. Few tables and whoever was in the bar. We ordered our drinks from the manager.  And waited about 5 minutes or so. Our drinks were incorrect, but drank them either way. We proceeded to order an order of Texas cheese fries while our food came. They were terrible.  45% of it was burned and stuck to the skillet. Something that's never happened. Their excuse was they didn't butter it. No replacement offered. Once out plates came it was cold. Seemed like they had been sitting out for a long period of time. My chicken was cold in the middle and my sisters ribs were undercooked and cold to the bone. Called the manager over and offered a new rack of ribs. We waited 25 minutes for those ribs and they never came. The waitress never came by to ask how were doing. When we did see her it took 10 minutes to get us forks. As we asked for our check we noticed multiple charges for things we did not order. We were charged 1.99 for ""entertaiment"" we did not use. 12.99 for beer we did not order or drink. The waitress went to speak to the manager. He took her to the kitchen. I saw him grabbing a rack of ribs from who knows where and sticking it into a to go plate. Knocking off the prices for which we were not charged with an additional 15% off . He never ONCE came to apologize.  Instead he cowered into the corner of the kitchen and sent the waitress to apologize. Never stepping into this establishment again. My sister and I both have stomach pains and indigestion after about an hour.  I'm a manager at a business as well, I would never manage my team to treat customers this way in a thousand years.

While Kristi far exceeded our expectations, we have noticed recently all of the staff are better at customer service. I may be wrong, but it seems there may be a new general manager or at least newer. We met her tonight and were very impressed. We watched her bring out food, drinks, checking on orders and customers. Always working and always visible.  I love people who lead by example and have passion for their work. It's contagious and I attribute the better service to the leadership at Tulare's Chilies.
