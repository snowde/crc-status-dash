136,Lilly P.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,3,,2.0,2014-12-19,"We expected some growing pains as this is a new restaurant however, who ever is managing this location needs some help!  We sat  in the bar which is nice however why would you put iconic Hollywood photos and a shot of LAX on the wall of a bar in the IE?  Food took quite a while, that was  expected, my medium rare burger was so over cooked and dry it was awful!  Chicken casadia was seriously lacking chicken and the margaritas were so weak you could not taste any tequila.  Wait staff is spending too much time busing tables and not tending to their guests, waited over 30 minutes for our check after asking 2 servers and finally the manager! We will give them a few months and try again. Serious disappointment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-upland?start=120,2.408,2.408,2.408,2.408,2.4080000000000004

As with any new opening you can expect a few minor ""hiccups"" however, I've been pleasantly surprised since there has only been a few (my experience). I ordered the trio fajitas. I will stick with the barbeque ribs. The margaritas were good but lacked tequila, (management really need to look into that). Overall a good experience, will be back! Also, customers need to take note this is a brand new chili's. Cut the employees some slack.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-upland?start=120,2.644,2.644,2.644,2.644,2.644

206,Rebecca D.,"Las Vegas, NV",1,9,2.0,1.0,2014-12-26,"This was easily the worst dining experience I've ever had. We love this restaurant chain too, so the disappointment hurt that much more haha. I feel bad because a part of me wants to cut them a small amount of slack because they just opened about 2 weeks ago, but this was honestly an absolute train wreck. Our waitress seemed to be semi-conscious at best. It took her forever to take our order, it took them forever to get our drinks out, it took them foreverrrrrr to get our food out, and when we actually did get service... NO ONE SEEMED TO KNOW WHAT THEY WERE SERVING OR IF THEY WERE SERVING IT TO THE RIGHT TABLE. Once our food was actually out, all three entrees were incorrect, and my sister had a large strand of hair in her pasta. Back to our waitress though, I lost count of how many times she walked past our table completely ignoring us. She was so oblivious to the fact that we were having a horrible time. The manager was at our table twice, and she barely noticed that. It would be different if the restaurant was busy, but it wasn't. Not in the least. All of this occurred in almost a 2 hour time period, so that's 2 hours of being ignored, and 2 hours of chilies bar and grill hell. Needless to say, I am really upset, and this is coming from someone who hates to complain about food service. Now we are going to Lazy Dogs to eat a decent meal with better service hopefully. To be honest though, as long as it doesn't take 45 minutes for us to get a chips and salsa appetizer, I'd be happy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-upland?start=180,2.052,2.052,2.052,2.052,2.052

My husbands chicken crispers were missing the corn and the fries were cold. My grilled shrimp tacos were cold and missing one side. The side salad that was included came in a small styrofoam box and didn't have any tomatoes. We are used to receiving delicious side salads from Rancho served in a lovely plastic box.  When we arrived our meal was not yet ready so the cold food was not our fault.  The ""To Go"" Specialist was interacting with other employees instead of handling our business.  We will be going to Chili's in Rancho instead. We have never had a problem with any orders at that location. Also, the parking for pick up orders in Rancho is immediately in front of the door for To Go orders - more convenient than Upland.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-upland?start=120,2.1559999999999997,2.1559999999999997,2.1559999999999997,2.1559999999999997,2.1559999999999997

113,Jay W.,"Upland, CA",349,7,1.0,1.0,2015-01-10,"Man I was so excited when construction for this building site was finished. What restaurant will it be? BJ's? Buffalo Wild Wings? Olive Garden? Cheesecake?! (lol in my dreams). Out of all the franchise restaurants it could have been for all the people living around this area, it just had to be Chili's. What a serious disappointment and wasted potential for our community.  But of course, it's unfair to judge so quickly without even trying to place. After all, chili's as a company seemed to be trying their best and even updated its logo recently. Our family gave it a shot with a supporting attitude. Last time we tried was more than 10 years ago; we didn't even know why we hated chili's and didn't remember what was so bad about it. Since it's so close to home, hopefully maybe we could be regulars. Hopefully, it was acceptable. lol. Nowhere near acceptable. It was the first week of their opening so of course we were lenient and more understanding.. But our waiter had this terrible stench. Was it his clothes? his hair? breath? who the hell knows but the smell was nowhere near faint and dominant whenever he was at our table. The service was as expected not good, they never brought crayons and everything came late and we had to ask our smelly waiter several times. The kid's cheeseburger didn't even come with cheese. We ordered some combo dinner plan and they overcharged us with the dinner plan as well as individually what comes with the dinner plan. the bill was $20 over and it took forever to fix and when we told them, they said they knew but I guess they weren't going to tell us lol.  Hows the food? unbelievably salty. There's no flavor at chilis other than extreme saltiness. Dessert, margaritas, salad, soup, bread. Everything was salty beyond belief.  What a waste of space. Brings nothing to our community. I hope this place goes out of business so it gets replaced with literally any other franchise very very soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-upland?start=100,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003

155,Lauren B.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,10,2.0,1.0,2015-01-21,"Had two different experiences(both terrible) is such a short period of time. The first incident was a phone in order. One evening I had my boyfriend phone in an order(since he lived 20 miles away)he thought it wise to call in an order so by the time he got to my area(Upland) the food would be ready for pickup, mind you this all started around 6:30pm.... 7:15pm rolls around and I call him to see what is going on and he said he is waiting for our food(and I am thinking 45mins?!?!? it should be ready) 7:40pm rolls around and still no boyfriend- no food. By this time I send texts asking whats going on, about 10 mins later he shows up at my house with the food and I was so confused I asked what happened- he then explained to me that the server(accidentally) never hit the process button on the phone order and had to re-enter our order when he got there(and she didn't think to call him back once she realized the error?!?!?!) Mind you she had known what happened because she said to him oh your that order I forgot to punch in...... Seriously?!?!?? You knew what happened and never bothered to call back and fix the error????? Anyways moving on he then told me there was also a delay because the kitchen ran out of soup(happened on both occasions)... Whatever, I  was over the food drama wanted to eat my meal. Open my to go box and my food was not as order(mashed potatoes, no gravy) Chicken(no BBQ Sauce) Soup(cold and no cheese). I tried to justify it by thinking hey it's a new restaurant and needs to work out the kinks, I get that.......... A few weeks later I wanted to give them a chance again......... Big mistake....... Arrived at the restaurant, seated fairly quickly..... Sat for approximately 15 minutes and had not been approached by a server, finally when address we met one lady she asked for our drink order and another girl walked up as well but seemed confused... Later on the confused girl brought us our drinks and asked for our food order(apparently she is our server) we gave her our order and also requested soup as an appetizer, once the order was placed we sat an additional 25 minutes and finally the server explained they had ran out of soup(again?!???!?) so she said it's only a few more minutes and would refill our drinks and apologized....... Finally the soup had arrived, oh and guess what our meals as well(now are going on almost 35 minutes in wait time for our meals not too mention the total wait time for the dining experience) she kept apologizing and offered us more soup for free.... Why would I want to wait even longer for more soup........ Needless to say this experience was horrible and the overall time lapsed for this dinner totaled almost 1 hour 40 minutes... Ugh this restaurant has a lot to be desired at this point........",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-upland?start=160,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003

He was snotty, rude and condescending. We sat for over an hour waiting for our food until my mother went looking for the manager. The person who came to our table and presented himself as the manager, was actually the cashier and even though none of us had eaten any of the food he tried to give us a bill for over $80. When we disputed that because the service was terrible, my mothers drink was wrong and again we had eaten nothing except a small appetizer the cashier, pretending to be the manager tried to insist we pay for the drinks and actually added a 5th drink to the bill. Eventually he agreed to only charge us for the 2 margaritas that my brother and his girlfriend actually drank, but when he got home he found that he had in fact been charged for the drinks and the food he hadn't eaten.

Our waiter was Joe and he was very friendly and knew his stuff.  The type that doesn't need to write down the order for a party of three or four. Definitely won't find this guy obccesseed and distracted while waiting your table (inside joke, sorry). From the moment of walking in we could tell it was a little different than the Chilies we've been to in the past. More open floor plan and as we soon found out, more personal - like introductions to four people working there, trying hard to get to know you (maybe harder than some people would be comfortable with? Or too friendly for some?). But they might tone this down if the table doesn't seem to care for that type of service. It was ok for us since it wasn't a serious or formal dinner. I did feel a little pressure to buy or spend more. The typical upsell/cross sell that you seem to get everywhere these days that builds profits for companies. Gotta increase that average order value even in the restaurant biz.  Although the restaurant was good and full it wasn't too full. Saturday about 8 pm. 2 minutes to be seated. AND you can call ahead which helps make sure you don't wait very long to be seated.  The food was good as were Joes recommendations. Salmon, shrimp tacos, and some big fat burger, so a little of everything.  The beer was great. Local brewery (Dale Bros) so it's nice to enjoy that at a chain restaurant.

141,Irene F.,"Upland, CA",84,2,,1.0,2015-03-01,"it is unfortunate that I cannot give this place negative stars.  we walked in and found a place in the bar area. while our waitress came and took our drink orders, it took her 10 min to even bring me my beer.  we noticed our waitress was paying attention to the table next to us a lot. from listening to her talk to the child, we find out that it was her family. while I think it is nice they came to show their support. she could have at least paid attention to our table, that was located literally right next to them.  she took forever just to come and take our orders and even then looked distracted. so for the next 30 minutes my fiancé and other friend watched her parade around her little niece and talk to her family. after her family left, her father walks in and sits on the other side of us. she yells across the room asking for his drink order. NEVER ONCE DID SHE GO TO CHECK ON OUR MEAL. (I know this because our table was right next to the kitchen) I would have talked to the manager about feeling neglected after my empty beer sat there for 15 min, but he seemed to be on friendly terms with her, so I understood it would be pointless.  our waitress continued to just stand around and seemed to feel no need to do any actual work, (while I saw a different waitress running around like crazy). eventually she left her little spot against the wall and brought us our food.  my appetizers were warm at best, my fiancés salmon was burned and dry, and my friends food was warm as well. when we told the waitress she said we will make you a new one salmon (I didn't want to wait another 30 min for the rest of our meals). she left the burned meal on our table and didn't bother to take it away til the manager brought the new one. in the process the manager literally dropped the plate into my fiancés hands (she almost dropped it) and walked away, didn't say anything to us.  I waited another 15 min for the check, and decided that I wont be returning anytime soon. thanks for showing me exactly how bad service can get :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-upland?start=160,2.24,2.24,2.24,1.6360000000000001,2.24

On our first visit the service was very slow, our drinks were not refilled and the waitress seemed to disappear for long periods of time. We thought they were still working out the bugs since they had just opened so we decided to give them another chance.  On our second visit the waitress again was difficult to find. Drinks were empty way too long. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I feel like you should never have to ask for a refill when you are drinking a bottomless beverage. We used the tablets on the table to pay our bill. As soon as we did we never heard from our waitress again.  Despite the first two poor experiences we decided to go back a third time. We sat out on the patio because it was a nice evening. This time I ordered a large beer. When I finished it, it sat empty for a few minutes. When the waitress finally came out and noticed it she asked if I wanted another. I told her I would like a small one this time. The beer never showed up but sure enough it was on our bill. This is an understandable mistake. I'm not sure how it happened. The waitress blamed the food runners. She then asked if I wanted her to take it off the bill. I told her I wasn't paying for something I never got. She apologized and took the bill. A few minutes later I see the manager walking over with our bill. Rather than apologizing or asking if we needed anything else he just dropped, yes DROPPED the bill on our table and walked away without saying a word! What kind of leadership is that?!?!

94,Eric O.,"Laguna Hills, CA",236,219,53.0,1.0,2015-05-14,"I came here last week with my parents - we normally dine at the La Verne location, but this store was closest for the both of us on that particular day. It was our first time at this store. Let me preface our server Alyssa was amazing. This review is about the management. As they normally do, my parents ordered off the 2 for $20 menu. Dad ordered the Cajun Chicken Pasta, and my Mom the 6 ounce Sirloin. I don't consider them picky people; they are rather laid back. However, a recurring issue they have had is seemingly every time my Mom orders a steak, it comes out either under cooked or over cooked. My Mom orders her steak Medium Well - a light pink center. As you can imagine, with a smaller steak, it cooks fast.  Sure enough, my Mom's steak was over cooked. When she cut into it, there was no pink - anywhere. My parents asked Alyssa to take the steak back and have a new one cooked. My life was left with her side of skillet mashed potatoes, which she picked at. My Dad waited to eat his meal, out of respect for my Mom. I was in a time crunch and was left with no choice but to eat my meal. The manager came out immediately and apologized, and said my Mom's new steak was on the grill and would be out shortly. My parents figured since it was only a 6 ounce Sirloin, and since it was being re-cooked, it would have priority, since two thirds of the table had food. Instead, my parents waited almost 15 minutes for the steak to come out.  By this time, my Dad's pasta had cooled tremendously, and I was almost finished with my meal. When my Mom's steak came out, it was cooked more on the Medium side than Medium Well, but my parents didn't say anything, as my they just wanted to eat. My Mom had also ordered her broccoli double steamed. This is something every single Chili's has been willing to do and Alyssa assured us the kitchen would do. However, her broccoli was not double steamed, was very hard, and she was not able to eat it. Again, my parents didn't say anything because my Mom was very hungry, and my Dad wanted to finish his pasta while it was still lukewarm. Another concern was the way the check was printed. I know this may not seem like a big deal, but it seemed the manager was trying to fool us into thinking the steak was comped off the bill. My parents were charged the $17 for the 2 for $20 meal, as well as the $3 for the 2 for $20 appetizer (which is the normal way to ring in a 2 for $20 meal). However, my parents were charged $11.99 for an additional steak. Then my parents were given a comp of $11.99.  I know Chili's uses the Aloha POS system, which means, the Manager has the ability to delete an item off a check rather than do an open food comp. Logistically, it would make more sense to delete the additional steak off the menu to make things clearer for the guest. The fact the comp was left on the bill led my parents to initially believe they were getting comped for the steak. However, I quickly pointed out that was not the case - and my parents were in fact being charged the full amount for their meal. When Alyssa came back to the table to collect the check, I took her aside and asked about the comp - and whether it was meant to be an actual legitimate comp for the trouble with the steak, or if it was just making up for extra steak which was rang in. She paused for a moment and then said, ""Well....this is how my Manager wanted to ring it in...if you think you shouldn't pay for the steak..."" At this point, I cut her off and said, ""No, it's fine."" I didn't want to look like my parents were beggars or trying to scam the system. My parents paid the bill, tipped Alyssa accordingly (20% which was deserved), and then left. On the way out, I asked the host who the Area Manager was, and the Manager On Duty happened to be walking up, and informed me it was Jason. On their way home, my Father decided the right thing to do was to call and speak with the Manager On Duty and let him know his thoughts on the night. When he asked the Manager about the way he rang the check, and why he chose to leave the Comp on when it really wasn't a comp, he had nothing to say. Dead silence. He gave them a cut and paste response informing them he would ""talk to the cooks and make sure they cook the steaks to the proper temperature"", and then said he would take the steak off the bill. While that is nice of him, and arguably the right thing to do, I can't help but realize this was only offered after I asked who the Area Manager was, and My Dad called. This wasn't done while my parents were in the restaurant. My Mom was not offered fresh side dishes. My Dad wasn't offered to have my food heated up, when it was obvious he had not touched it while waiting for my Mom's food. No one apologized for her re-cook taking almost 15 minutes.  My family really likes Chili's - there are some great menu items.

Now I am really mad!) My daughter is an eagle eye and noticed this right away and the server said ,""Oh, I will take it off of your bill"". Darn right you will! SO BEWARE! If your kiosk is missing, say something! We will NEVER revisit this Chili's again. We are generous and still tipped our sever 20%. Still, we are beside ourselves due to our server not caring in the least. We were more like a pain in her backside than customers. See ya, would not want to be ya. Too bad so sad....because we are excellent tippers even better than 20% when we get excellent service.

We are about equal distance to the one in Rancho Cucamonga but figured I would give this me want to shot. We should've went to the one in Rancho. We did not have to wait for a table which was surprising for a Saturday evening. It took about 10 minutes for somebody to come to our table once we were seated to get our drink order. It took about 20 minutes to a half an hour after that to get our starters. It took close to an hour from the time we ordered our dinner to the time it was brought to the table. We were very disappointed and will not be returning to this location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-upland?start=180,1.88,1.88,1.88,1.9600000000000002,1.88

Keep in mind we eat a chilies on a regular basis and I wanted Rancho Cucamonga has an exceptional food and service. This is not true of the one in Upland, although it's only been open a few months find out it should've worked out the problems(It has not). We arrived at 12:45 the restaurant was not even half full in order to lunch with salads. After 35 minutes one of the assistant managers stroll by the table and asked how things were going we explained we didn't know we haven't seen anything except a glass of water. Seeing that we were talking to someone else the waitress interrupted the conversation and ask what she could do for us. We has to is the salad was to be delivered before the meal or with the meal? She said I can go get it now and did so. However it was not what we ordered (not even close). We gave up and asked for the Manager we explained the situation including the salad had the wrong type of lettuce, toppings, Etc. And that we get wanted to have our salad before the meal, at this point the waitress but it in even with the manager and decided to argue with us in him. He told us that are was ready and that he would bring it out immediately. He went back to the kitchen and came out  a few seconds later with naked salad no cucumbers no tomatoes no onions no carrots no nothing, but it didn't have the right kind of lettuce. We told him we're going to leave, is only answer was the food was ready, we had explain to him that was the salad cold steaks hot have it all sitting on the table at the same time was just not acceptable I asked for his business card turns out his name is Koby Bias.

A young woman walked by and said she would be back to clean our table. She returned about 5 minutes later with a wet rag and began wiping off the table. She had a sneer on her face and looked like she really didn't want to be there. When she was done we said thank you. She just walked away. About 10 minutes later our server walked up and took our drink order. She seemed pleasant. After another 10 minutes without our drinks we decided to leave. Our server was nowhere to be found, and we had been there almost half an hour with no drinks, much less food. I walked up to the person I believed was the manager. A man in a blue shirt. He was busy doing something on a computer register. It took him a long time to acknowledge me. When he finally turned around I told him that we had sat there for 25 minutes with no drinks, food or server in sight. He said ""I'm sorry sir"", then went about his business. We left. In Chilis defense, they did reply to my online comment I sent them saying they were sorry and were sending me a complimentary dining certificate. I have not received it.

Rather than bus the dirty dishes, the servers piled the plates with uneaten food on the table next to me. The smell and flies were awful. They even had a squirt bottle on one of the chairs I guess to be used to chase away the flies. The servers just kept piling up the dirty dishes.  At one point the pile was so high, one of the servers trying to balance even more dishes on the stack dropped a dirty beer mug on the ground. Broken glass everywhere...guess what - they just left it with shrouds of glass everywhere without sweeping up the dangerous mess. Terrified customers had to yell and scream as people entered the patio to avoid the glass as many were just wearing flip flops, unaware of the ""mine field"" of broken glass. Asked the bartender where the manager was. Her reply was the manager told the bar employees they were on their own. Too bad, this is a nice location but the owners have to realize it will not run itself.

The best part of the meal was the Chips and Salsa  (with guacamole included )  for an appetizer ,  and they give you lots of it. The hamburger was okay although the meat was fired  ( not flame broiled )  and the Hamburger bun could have been a little bigger. The fry's were served cold because they must have been sitting out for awhile and may have come out of a frozen bag because they were dried up and tasteless.  I got the Onion rings with my order  , they were really good although there wasn't many of them.  She said she would be back with ranch dressing but it never happened..  Finally , I didn't really care for the tip bar touch screen.   Everyone has already had their hands on this thing and I know I would be better off writing in the tip on paper myself.  This also seems like a cheap ploy for anyone in the Bar area because you move the tip bar with your finger and when you touch the Done icon , your tab is complete.   Overall  , this place may be better suited for the younger crowed who likes a change up from fast food.  Maybe someday I'd like to come back again and try out some other items from the menu , and hopefully find a more normal waitress to take my order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-upland?start=160,1.88,1.88,1.88,1.8960000000000001,1.88
139,Kelly C.,"La Mesa, CA",0,13,,1.0,2015-07-28,"We arrived approx. 6:45pm. 15 minute wait on a Friday was great!  We were promptly greeted by a server. Very happy and enthusiastic!  The 3 kids drinks came promptly. Except for 1 root beer and my skinny margarita. About 15 minutes later we had been told they had to run to the store for the root beer. (which was funny we laughed) but seriously it was taking quite a bit of time. Another 5 min passed and here comes the skinny margarita/root beer.Ciarra (i hope this is correct spelling) took our food order. She was very patient we had a few substitutions and questions. Very happy and pleasant to accommodate our every request.  Within 10 min she returned to offer the kids refills. After another 10 minutes the kids meals arrived. One mistake 1 of the kids meals was supposed to come with fruit not fries. She quickly returned with fruit. The adults continued to snack on the chips./ guac until our food arrived. A few times we were checked on but curious when our food was going to come......I had also realized my soup had not arrived.  After another drink refill for the kids we had started to get a bit concerned.Still  NO food. Another 10 minutes passed. The kids are finished now and getting anxious. By now it is close to 45 min later after the kids had received their meals. WE were all a bit bothered since WE had intended on having a dinner together not in ""shifts"". Although we appreciate the kids meals first waiting another 45 minutes for our entrees is simply unacceptable.  Now the real disappointment starts...the sirloin that I ordered was Well done. I ordered Med Rare. The steak had all the sauce on it. I had requested no sauce. I am on a strict no salt diet. I had waved down the server to alert her of my disappointment and to ask where is my soup? Ciarra was embarrassed and could not apologize enough. Again, she was wonderful. She quickly ran away with my incorrect entree to correct the issue.  The other entree that had been delivered (part of the 2 for $20 menu) was also incorrect.  After 1/2 of the fajitas were finished my friend mentioned he never received his rice or accompaniments for the fajitas. Again a service fail. :( WE now were very bothered, We asked to speak to the manager. WE assured Ciarra she was very polite and kind we just wanted to express our concerns with the food coming out of the kitchen. She agreed and commented she understood. It did take a Very Long Time!  Sooo now that my friends were almost done with their meals the Manager came with my ""new entree"". Karl was the Manager on this evening. When he walked up and delivered my steak he asked me to cut into it to check the temp. I did and then I asked him Are You the Manager? Since he did not address himself as the manager as he approached our table. He replied, ""YES"", unfortunately.  We then proceeded to explain the course of events and how we were very concerned of the service from the kitchen. Our children's meals were delivered promptly (1 incorrect) but the our meals took over 45 min after they were done eating. The meals were incorrect and the fajitas were missing rice/condiments. He did a very ""quick"" apology and headed back to the kitchen to request the rice.  Once he left our table we all looked at each other with a very confused look. We felt he was not very genuine with his response nor did he sound sympathetic to his customers concerns. He did offer the 3 children a bowl of ice cream prior to departing (which was kind) but we had thought when he left this was this his offer to ""compensate"" us for our poor food quality and timing? WE never asked for any compensation out of spite. WE assumed it was ""understood"" after the series of errors and time delays it was a ""give in!!"" I finally finished my meal alone since everyone else had their meals completed. Very disappointing!!  When the check came the Server mentioned her manager had removed my steak ONLY. The drinks,Soup and The 2 for $20.00 meal was on there. WE were shocked he did not remove the margarita,soup and at least 1/2 of the 2 for $20.00 meal for the inconvenience we all experienced.WE paid our bill and left Ciarra a generous 20% tip. She was very kind through the entire painful experience. she needs to train the manager how to be sympathetic and understanding the customer.  I am a Senior Manager of a major hotel chain in the Catering Events department in Southern California. Being in the hospitality industry for over 30+ years I would never expect this type of service and / or response from a manager. WE love chili's however; this particular evening was a complete FAIL except for Ciarra. I would hope for some sort of response from the Corporate Office Customer Care. I know this is quite long however; worth my time to ensure this type of situation is addressed and the customers comments make a difference.

She always makes you laugh and smile; plus if anything goes wrong with your order, she makes sure it gets fixed. I have noticed that during the week I typically never have any problems; however, weekends are when the food gets slower and you might have to check your steak for doneness or ask where your appetizer is. Altogether, I come here for the atmosphere, convenience, and I am in love with their chips and guacamole.

We got dropped off at a table and I said, ""Thanks have a good day,"" as the employee turned and walked away without a word. Awks.  Fine, so she probably doesn't care because there's no tip involved or something, but we're told that we have two servers... but the whole time only one server shows up. Not a bad thing, just weird. It seems as if the staff is just busy flirting with each other. Entertaining for us, I guess, but I'd rather get my food... The two for $20 deal is awesome, but don't order the extra 6 shrimp!! The saddest looking thing I've seen in a while was my dad's face when his ""extra"" order came in. To make matters worse, they forgot to bring it in the first place and my dad had to catch one of them to ask for it. Just don't do it. I got the bacon burger, which is always a yum for me so no discussion needed. Oh, and another thing that you shouldn't do is click on any games on their Ziosk (the screen with the games on it).

The food like usual, was very good as we had the two for $20 dinner of the 6 oz classic sirloin, Texas cheese fries and a few beers. What really surprised us was the beer selection was much better then we remembered with a fairly large choice of craft beers, something I think you all know about us by now. The one negative thing I will say is not even Chilli's fault. There is absolutely no parking in the colonies area that Chilli's resides.

One couple ended up paying someone else's tab, our tab was lost in Ziosk land as well. The solution to the switch up of tab's for the people...One couple paid for the wrong tab and left, the other party was still finishing up dinner. The waitress laughed while explaining that the couple that left, ended up paying the higher tab. She had the remaining couple pay the other tab, which was less then their own.

We ordered chips and salsa and then a house salad and asked for it to come out before our food well by the time we were already half way done with our DRINKS our chips and salsa and salad still didn't come! But our waiter was just walking around passing us like we weren't even there! I had to stop her while she was passing to ask for our chips! She then brought out our chips and again I had to ask her for the house salad! Our food soon came out after that, not once after did our waiter come back to our table she didn't give us any refills on our empty drinks she didn't come see if we needed anything else or any dessert or any boxes! I then again had to stop her while she was passing to ask for our dessert and some boxes! At that point we just had it we asked for our dessert to go and paid our bill and left probably one of the worst tips anyone can leave someone!

65,Rob S.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,9,,1.0,2016-05-31,"Since this Chili's had just opened, I thought everything about it was going to be great. I walked in with my family, and it looked great. The atmosphere was great. We should have walked out then, because looking in the dining area and I saw 4-5 booths that were empty and hadn't been cleared. It didn't strike me as something to be concerned about. So we signed in, the wait time was going to be 15 minutes. We waited in the restaurant, got seated, no problems there. Waitress took a while to get to us, but she seemed swamped. Let me make one thing clear: our waitress was very apologetic about everything that happened and was the best waitress we've had in a while. We got our order in around 6 pm, and it was busy. We figured it would take a while to get our food. My sister and I split the 2 for $35 deal, except I don't drink alcohol so I gave the drink to her friend. The margaritas came and my sister's drink literally had a couple long, brunette hairs in it. She isn't a brunette. I guess the GM - I'm not exactly sure who he was honestly, but he wasn't dressed like a server - overheard it and said he would cut the price in half. Awesome! What he didn't say was that it was half off the margaritas, not the whole meal like he implied. As part of the meal, we ordered fried pickles, and when the other appetizer came out the waitress said they were out of fried pickles, but they were working on finding some. When the order came out, the 'fried pickles' consisted of five fried pickle chips and the rest (the size of an order of french fries) was just fried bread crumbs. Like really? Is that normal, or is that what they threw together? I don't know if the kitchen was swamped or what, but we didn't get our meal until 30 minutes later. It felt like forever. I got the fajitas cadillac style, which means you get a side of rice and beans. It also came with cheese, sour cream, among other things. The sour cream was warm and separated - not creamy at all. The rice and beans with both of our fajitas were cold, and the tortillas weren't plentiful. I felt like I had to keep asking for tortillas and by the time the second batch came, my chicken was cold. Overall, I am very dissatisfied with this Chili's location and will not be returning until improvements are made.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-upland?start=80,2.24,2.19,2.19,2.116,2.2100000000000004

We paid the bill without touching the food, and left. So, understandably, you can imagine my lack of enthusiasm when my teenagers suggested for us to have dinner there at the upland colonies chilis. But, I reluctantly went anyway, having high hopes and extremely low expectations.  When we got there, it was clean and well maintained. We were greeted by a friendly hostess and seated immediately in a comfy booth. We ordered the two for twenty and our appetizer arrived in a short amount of time. It was hot, looked delicious, and was tasty and plentiful. Then the entrees arrived. The steak was delightful. The Chili's hamburger is one of the best- even rivals Vegas or in n out's.

We continued to come back because the service at this particular location was always above average compared to most. Service is the main reason people come back to a chain restaurant,  everyone knows that. So what the HELL happened this time Cody?  We brought a party of 8 on Saturday afternoon. Light crowd, plenty of servers on hand. So you would think things would go well, WRONG!!!!!! After we were seated we were told we would have three servers for our group and then one came over and delivered their wonderfully prepared statement. Saying she was one of our servers but our main waitress will be there shortly. We never heard from her or the third alledged server from the grassy knoll again!!!!! Our main waitress came by and said it was her second day ( the exact person you would assign for a party of 8, come on  Cody, really?) And she struggled to keep up. Now I get that she was new and I have no problem with that. But give the girl some support like your prepared statement said you would.  Well the kitchen staff must be under Cody's management also because our food came over in delayed sections. Our 2 year old  grandson was supposed to get a kids pepperoni pizza and they brought it without any pepperoni on it. Literally 25 mins later they brought the correct pizza. Great now we are all almost finished eating and we have to wait for a two year old to finish eating.  The corn of the cob (which I love) I ordered did not arrive with my meal. It arrived 25 minutes later with my grand son's pizza. You know, if would have got my corn on the cob in a timely manner, I probably would never have written this review. You see Cody, even the simple things matter. Well, the manager Cody came over and  asked how things went. I told him each thing that went wrong with our meal. All he said was "" sorry......... sorry ........and sorry"". Great, that made things better, thanks Cody for those heartfelt words. We will remember that the next time we come back......NOT!!!!!. Our server came over and apologized again ( at least she meant it) and I asked her if the manager was having a bad day. She must of mentioned it to him because he came back to our table as we were leaving and asked if I had something else I wanted to say. This.time with a little attitude (must have struck a nerve with him). I said no, nothing else say to you but you can check out my yelp and Google reviews if he would like.   Now my dear old grammy always used to say,  "" never get into a verbal or physical confrontation with the managerly challenged"".

At 6:40 we saw a friend an owner of another restaurant talking to the owner of Chillies. My Fiancé went to talk to him. Once we did that, we had a manager at our table within 5min. He refreshed our margaritas since they literally tasted like the mixer. When we got our food it was cold so I told the manager that fajitas are supposed to come out on a hot plate and he snapped back with, ""did you try them?"" I said no. The fact that he said that means he knew they were not up to par!! He tells me he will go ""warm it up"" instead of making me a new one! We were there 2hrs and they did nothing to make the experience better! Worst experience ever, we won't be returning!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-upland?start=80,2.56,2.33,2.33,2.212,2.422

She pre-ordered online and was instructed the food would be ready in 20 mins. She arrived 30 mins later. After standing in the lobby, no one offered to help her immediately. They advised the employee who does ToGo's was arriving momentarily and he would help her. We couldn't understand why another server could not help us.  After about 10 mins, the ""ToGo"" employee arrived and stated it would take him another 5-10 mins to prepare the food. Shouldn't the food already have been ready?! We surprised us was the lack of teamwork this location has. Why wouldn't another employee help with our order. Now we had to suffer our food being cold due to their laziness. When we asked commented to our manager that our food may be cold for waiting that long he didn't seem to care. He advised it had been sitting under the warmer and he couldn't do anything about us waiting so long. Of course by the time we got home all our food was Cold!  During another incident when we order ToGo they have gotten our order wrong. That is very frustrating when you arrive home and it is not correct. What's wrong with this location!!!!!!?????

Disorganized - on another occasion I placed an order only to walk in and pick it up 15 minutes later to be told that they were out of what I had ordered and looked confused as to why I didn't know that citing someone should have called.

First, drinks were wrong. Fine..not a biggie until 20 minutes later we still had not received new drinks AND only 2 of the 5 of us received water so needless to say, we were thirsty. Fast forward another 20 min...(so 40 min since we ordered) and no food. At this point, the waitress ""Sierra""!said it was due to a sudden rush and kitchen back up. Problem with that excuse...it was a Mon night and the place was only half full. We ask our server again and she says it's a few min more and assures us appetizer will come before food. Well she was half right...1 min later app comes...as well as 1 person's meal. Problem with this besides the obvious that our appetizer is no longer such, is that 20 min later the rest of our party still has no food. Now server ""Sierra"" says it was a problem with the ""input system""...a glitch. We are at an hour since ordering now. Ask to speak to manager and he says it was the server's fault as she failed to enter more than half our order and days she lied to us and asked him to cover but he told her ""it's your problem""...hmmm...seems like as his server it's HIS problem. He rolls his eyes and literally sighs as he has to hear my sister complain. She's been a server for 30 years so she obviously had an opinion about all this. He says well don't worry...I'll get dessert for you and your food will be out in 5 min so like I told you, you'll get your food"". Really??? Free dessert with a side of attitude??? On my b-day when I already get desert...wow...thanks. Fast forward another 15-20 min (well over an hour since ordering) still no food for 75% of our party. At this point we get up to leave. Manager begs us to say and now says he'll comp meal. We sit (can't pass up a free steak meal). Our server returns and continues the excuses and brushes off the situation stating it was just ""one of those days"" and ""I try to treat my guests as I would like to be treated"". Really Sierra?? Do you like to be lied to and pushed aside? By the way...she would disappear for literally 20 min at a time and we had 3 other fill ins. She does finally give a half hearted apology.

20,Steven D.,"Upland, CA",119,29,,4.0,2017-10-06,"Recently, a few big chain restaurants have changed their menus a bit and Chili's is one of them. They have trimmed their menu, added a few items, and it seems like they've added some new drinks to their selection.  The new items are fantastic! On our most recent visit my wife had their potato soup and I had the Grilled Avocado Sirloin. My wife loved the soup and my dish was so good! Our server, Hannah, took good care of us and said that what I ordered was one of the most popular new items. It did not disappoint.  Keep up the good work!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-upland,3.8,2.86,2.86,,3.2359999999999998
3,Ivan P.,"Montebello, CA",0,1,1.0,1.0,2017-10-08,Rude narrow minded to say the least seems food service TREATMENT is based on how they pre pick customers based on people at the table. Needless to say our waitress was Nice she apologized and picked up the slack for which the manager should had done which means she lives in the reality of this real  world of all people are humans who deserve to have great service and food.  Management team  Big epic Fail did not apologize for my old Greasy southwest egg rolls grabbed the tray walked away. My boyfriend ordered the same thing and they came out just great nothing like what I had I took note of all the food being served around me seems no one else had this problem seems like everyone else's food looked as it should.  Sure the response will be the same lame epic excuse everyone has a now days  but people really need to wake up grow up and get their heads out of their behinds and realize skin color doesn't matter people are people and people work hard and deserve to enjoy life and good times and eat good food not crap food or crap service based on how they look or who they're with. By the way every manager was walking around with the same rude nonchalant non-caring attitude on their face not helpful at all. The cold looks and service I received is a disgrace.  Continue to hope for change in this world people can be with who they want interracial love is Beautiful.

One of the things that I like about Chili's is that there are television monitors which are viewable from many different locations in the restaurant. I had the fajitas, Which I ordered with a special request. Which was done perfectly the first time. Even though I said in the bar, I think next time I will sit in the dining room.

22,Kelsey M.,"Pomona, CA",220,20,3.0,1.0,2017-12-18,"Disappointed in our poor service and undercooked food. From the minute we sat down we could tell our waitress was upset. We all ordered the fajitas and drinks. When the food arrived only 20% of the veggies were cooked. I requested for mine to be sent back and cooked more. She quickly took it without a response. When she returned she set it on the table with out a word. Our waters were not refilled and any interaction was met with rolled eyes. At one point my friend split her salsa and she came by to pick up the container and ran off without a word. We spoke to the manager Tim about our poor service. He was unprofessional and instead of simply apologizing shared how she was upset because she had to work late. He claimed other coworkers called out sick and she had a date planned. He then spoke to her and she later said to us, ""Sorry you thought I was in a bad mood. Do you want some water?""
