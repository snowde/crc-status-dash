6,Ron J.,"Melbourne, FL",2,61,2.0,2.0,2012-03-17,"Took quite a while to get our food.  We were seated quickly, our drinks arrived quickly, but our food took over 30 minutes to arrive at our table.   The floors were dirty, which seems to be common for all Clili's locations.  This is not at all one of my preferred dining establishments.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-viera?start=20,2.184,2.184,2.184,2.184,2.184

They moved us which is fine but then I saw them seat two old ladies at the same table. Seemed kinda messed up.

26,Hiram G.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",295,206,3429.0,1.0,2013-08-17,"Well first of all I am not a big fan of chain restaurants so you get what you pay for. I took my dad today for lunch he got the cheese stake sandwich and I got the triple dipper. We order draft beer, since it was happy hour was two for one. I asked the waitress of we could get the beer one at the time and she said no! Ok policy's of the company i guess is all good. Second mistake, draft beer has to be really cold to be good, when we received our beers they were warm I comment the issue to the waitress to what she asked me of I want a glass of ice for my beer. You kidding me ice with my beer? We eat and left. I would not recommend this place at all I don't go often but now I know for fact that I'm not coming back anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-viera,2.148,2.148,2.148,2.148,2.148
5,Sarah B.,"Melbourne, FL",592,77,67.0,1.0,2013-12-16,"Rude. Bottom line! Your ""Manager"" if that's what you hire... is RUDE. The question asked was ""Are you the manager?"" And his response ""I am one of them..."" pause. ""That's usually followed by some sort of feedback. What do you need?""  Absolutely RUDE. Our server had a ""server buddy"" which we never saw. Had to flag the server down for our appetizers and drinks. The table next to us was an older couple complaining they had been there for an HOUR waiting for their appetizer. The server was cool and calm but seriously Chili's on a Sunday night, the service should be GREAT. Our food came out and the inside of my chicken was pink. I didn't even eat it and I sat there forever waiting on my check to get OUT OF your restaurant. Server asked me if I wanted a box. (Why? So I can go home and cook my chicken to proper temp??) I said no. She brought them anyway. LOL.. You know..  bad service happens. I get that. I would even come back and hope for better service. HOWEVER.. What I DO NOT GET is a rude snippy manager. He knew we were not happy about our experience and he just shrugged us off like no big deal. I will NOT be returning to this particular Chilis again. I don't recommend it, in fact.. take a drive a little south about 2 exits and enjoy great service and amazing food at the Eau Gallie location. Trust me, it's worth the drive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-viera?start=20,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18
25,Michael K.,"Tampa, FL",288,239,461.0,2.0,2013-12-28,"It is Chili's, so for the most part, this review can apply to ANY Chili's.   Mediocre mass market comfort food that probably takes a  year off my life every time I walk in.   So THIS Chili's is kinda small, and set up in a somewhat weird way.  Doesn't give much a a vibe, and it feels a little dirty.  Not fully sure how to explain this, but it is Chili's there is better, albeit not much, in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-viera,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003

9,Summer R.,"Northeast Side, Universal City, TX",113,22,,1.0,2014-04-15,I typically love chilis but this one I will not be returning. The food was awful. I ordered fajitas and over 80% was just fatty. I would highly not recommend. At other locations in the past it was great and you got a lot of meat. This one you barely get any meat and when you do it's just fat.   You can't screw up chilis and everything is remade but this location has found a way to screw it up.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-viera?start=20,,,,,
18,Christopher G.,"Cocoa, FL",6,18,57.0,4.0,2014-10-03,Chili's is one of my favorite big chain restaurants. I have had some bad service at this location before but today service was good. Our drinks sat on the bar for awhile but other than that our waitress was very friendly. The food was tasty and what i expected.  Happy hour two for ones is always good!  I gave it 4 but its probably more like a 3 and a half.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-viera,,,,,
19,Sherri G.,"Cocoa, FL",2,36,18.0,3.0,2014-10-03,"Overall pleased with this trip. We arrived right at opening and it seems as though they were not completely ready to begin serving us and the service was a little slow. Our server was nice, but our drinks sat at the bar for a few minutes before she brought them to us.  The atmosphere was nice and clean and they have recently remodeled. The food was delicious and I thoroughly enjoyed our chips and Queso. My husband and I split a triple dipper with the new onion rings which were so crispy and cooked to perfection.  Two for one long island iced tea and jack and coke were the highlight of this trip and made my day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-viera,,,,,
2,Scott S.,"Cincinnati, OH",54,67,2.0,2.0,2015-02-27,"It was busy and there was a short wait but the wait definitely was not worth the food. Well, the chips were good but that's about it. My ribeye steak sucked. It had absolutely no taste. Nothing. Zilch! I can't say much for the skillet roasted potatoes either. It's like the cut up some potatoes and heated them in a skillet. No herbs. No spices. Nada! I guess steak lovers should stick with someplace else. Maybe Outback or something.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-viera?start=20,,,,,
0,Susan P.,"Asheville, NC",0,3,,2.0,2015-03-11,"Really not very good.  Had to ask to be moved from our booth as it was directly next to the loudest kitchen I have ever heard.  We then waited 25 minutes from order to the time our food was served.  My burger must have been cooking the entire 25 minutes as it was very overlooked.  Sweet potato fries were only a little warm.  The only bright spot was our server.  She was delightful.  I would have complained about the burger and fries, but I was hungry, did not want to wait another 25 minutes and did not want to give her any additional grief.  We have not been to a Chili's in a long time and will not be back soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-viera?start=20,,,,,
4,Brian B.,"Melbourne, FL",0,27,9.0,1.0,2015-05-05,"Had dinner here tonight.  Out of our 4 meals, 2 were missing avocados (as orrdered), one was fine and the last (ribs) were the worst I have ever had at Chillis.  I was craving ribs and usually I love them here, but tonight they were dry and just plain flavorless.  Even the Chilis sauce was dry and without flavor.  I normally would tell the manager or server, but tonight, no one ever asked us how our meals were.  I even went to the Chilis website to complain, but the website was so horribly slow, I gave up and decided to post my dissatisfaction with tonights meal on Yelp.  Our server was fine, too bad the meal wasn't.  I guess this is the last time I head to Chilis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-viera?start=20,,,,,
7,William L.,"Rockledge, FL",0,18,,3.0,2015-06-07,"My wife and I ate at Chili's last night after a movie in the Avenue. We were greeted and seated promptly. Our surroundings were clean and comfortable. The drinks were the typical two-for-one servings and of good quality. We had appetizers and they were great. Chili's is not a high-class restaurant, but it's comfortable with good food and a fun place to visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-viera?start=20,,,,,
20,Miso G.,"Melbourne, FL",271,66,99.0,5.0,2015-07-03,"Yep, it's a chain. But the good thing about chains is you always know what to expect. Chilis typically remains consistent among all of their locations. And this one does not disappoint. Free chips and salsa if you sit in the bar area. Don't tell anyone. Margaritas are terrific and not priced through the ying yang. We've been practically regulars at this location for about 4 years and it has stayed consistently good. Service is always top notch. The food isn't gourmet by any means, but it's never been bad. Steak fajitas are my favorite. A little salty for most, but I'm a saltaholic. Ribs are surprisingly good too. Turkey club is also a good choice. Nice selection, always clean, and fast and friendly service. Not one bad thing to say with over at least 50 visits over the past 5 years. Five stars, baby.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-viera,,,,,
13,Chriscoral A.,"Cocoa Beach, FL",40,184,126.0,4.0,2015-07-11,I had forgotten how good the ribs are. It's not just good marketing. The ribs are realy good for a chain catch ky restaurant.     Had dinner with my family. Party of 6 four adults and 2 kids. The waiter did a great job with everything.    Clean bathrooms great service and good food. OK prices.  And for a chillies this one is pretty good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-viera,,,,,

17,Chuck F.,"Melbourne, FL",156,115,314.0,4.0,2015-10-08,"Free chips and salsa at the bar, hot bartenders, and kick-butt margaritas are the hook to this well-known chain dealio. What's sweet about chains is consistency. The ribs are always meaty and cooked to perfection. I'm also a big fan of their steak fajitas. Once in a while, I get a bad cow. But for the most part, it's great. Service at the Viera location is exceptional. Krystal, Dave, Noel, and Melissa are seasoned professionals.

3,Rita N.,"Melbourne Beach, FL",0,15,,1.0,2015-10-30,Food was good but Mary the waitress added two items on bill which we were unaware of.

16,Maneen C.,"Titusville, FL",64,60,67.0,3.0,2016-01-12,"Just your regular run of the mill Chili's.  The bartender was pleasant and attentive, but she didn't have a fun, upbeat bartender personality... which is why we usually sit at the bar. Sometimes when you go out, you want to have more fun that just with each other, we like to socialize and this bartender did anything but that.  However, she kept everyone's drinks full timely so I can over look that. I ordered the chicken enchilada soup and house salad.  Wow, that chicken enchilada soup is amazing!!! I really recommend it!  Plus, on Sundays, they have 2 for 1 beers, although what they don't tell you is they are mugs of beer, not pints, but hey, you get an extra 4-8oz of beer for the price of one pint.  I'll definitely return for the soup!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-viera,,,,,
27,Keene M.,"Melbourne, FL",2,52,17.0,2.0,2016-02-24,"Wow, what a disappointment!  My perception of Chili's was upscale chain with better-than-average food.  Well, the food was pretty good but it took about 40 minutes to come out.   Biggest problem was the service.  Our server did a great job explaining the little computer on the table and how we could earn 60 points just for joining their club.  That's about the end of it.  Two of our guests asked for side sauce for their full rack of ribs.  It didn't come with the food so we asked her for it again.  The agreed to get it and went back to typing on her computer.  Our guest finally went to ask the host for it.  I then asked our servers assistant who promptly told the server.  Finally it was brought by the server and then a manager.  We were about done eating by then.  No apologies.  She wished us a good night as we left.  There are too many other places to spend our money.  We won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-viera,,,,,
29,Michael ..,"Melbourne, FL",0,17,2.0,3.0,2016-04-24,What is going on at Chilis? This is not a freakin sports bar.  Turn down the TVs.  They are all blasting.  Music is fine but blasting sports crap makes us want to leave.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-viera,,,,,
12,Sara W.,"East Rutherford, NJ",84,222,265.0,2.0,2016-05-19,"So it's Chili's and for that reason I didn't have any expectations, but maybe I should have.  I had just flown into Orlando to visit my sister and we stopped here for dinner on the way back to her place because (1) it was on the way and (2) it was Cinco de Mayo.  When we got there it pretty much looked like any other Chili's that I've been to, however in this Chili's the line to sit and eat was massive.  It took the hostess at least a half hour to seat us, but in her defense we did not call ahead and it was extremely busy. When we sat down, a waitress came over to take our drink order about 10 minutes later at which point we gave her the whole order.  Another 10-15 minutes later we got our drinks and five minutes after that our app came out.  Surprisingly quickly after that, our meals were placed in front of us.  I know that we happened to come in on a very busy evening and I can overlook how long it took us to be seated, the fact that the waitress took a bit longer than expected to take our drink order and bring out our drinks was a little frustrating (not the end of the world though).  However, to add insult to injury by messing up both my order and my sisters order put me over the top a little.  Food was exactly what you would expect, a greasy, flavorless mess... I think I've outgrown Chili's from my college days (can't resist those 2 for 1 Margs though)...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-viera,,,,,
28,Cari V.,"Miami, FL",1,118,3.0,2.0,2016-05-22,Exactly what you expect from any chili's - nothing more nothing less ... Drinks that are 2 for 1 that are watered down - food that is reheated after sitting for awhile ... What can I say ... Same anywhere,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-viera,,,,,
21,Mike W.,"Rockledge, FL",1,25,,5.0,2016-05-23,"Ok I know it's very trendy to bash Chilis but I like this place. The chips and salsa and drinks are good, servers are friendly, and they have the best enchiladas in this area. Im convinced the chocolate chip cookie dessert has drugs in it because it is so addictive. Oh sure, every time I mention Chilis my wife grumbles, but at the end of dinner she always says ""that was good!"" And she always sounds surprised.   And the pay at the table kiosk eliminates a pet peeve of mine....waiting on the check.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-viera,,,,,

24,Carol M.,"Melbourne, FL",0,5,,2.0,2017-05-09,So the watermelon Margaritas were good one is enough definitely not good enough to have two but a lot of time sweet drinks are this way.  Our server's name was Becca and she was quite pleasant and lovely and very attentive nothing negative at all the say about her she was a lovely girl.  But that's almost t for the pleasantries. The food wasn't horrendous but it was very mediocre nothing to want to make you come back the buffalo sauce on the chicken wings was good enough but the chicken wing skins felt slimy which I don't prefer .  got a half rack of ribs and corn on the cob the ribs were very tender but whatever they put on there made me feel like I was eating armpit... stinky sweaty type odor.  I'm sure that was just the SmokeHouse whatever they put on there but I don't like to rhinm about armpit when im eating. When I looked at my plate it look like I was eating peasant food corn was not that great and I don't know how you mess up corn on the cob.  rice was very bland flavorless was the cilantro lime rice or something. Not horrible but not good.  My sister had a tostada and an enchilada and she said it wasn't very good... I mean we ate the food it wasn't like it was making us sick but just very mediocre I will never come back here again that's all.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-viera,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6

I'm never disappointed but I'm a Chilis fan. If you don't like Chilis then, mwah.  However I will saw, the bartender I tend to get Tuesdays after 6pm isn't the most sociable. I'm used to Jared over in Daytona Beach ^_~. He knew my name and my drink and at last said ""hey how are you today"" when I spent $40 in drinks.  That being said, they are still pleasant and hospitable. My drink is always full, the food is hot and the music is doable. Therefor, Yelp reviewers, I am perfectly satisfied and will be back here at least 2X a month to have a drink and eat at the bar ^_^!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-viera,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84
