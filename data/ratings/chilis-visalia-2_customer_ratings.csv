Their full rack of baby back ribs is 10 ribs, never seen a rack that small. They ribs were dry with not much flavor to them. My wife had the fajita trio, flavorless also. Corn tortillas were overheated and hard, which made them tough to bite through. The condiments that came with the fajitas weren't even enough to make the three tacos with the tortillas provided.

First off the waitress didn't know her stuff saying the new steak didn't come with side of fries when the website says it does. Then they gave my wife's plate away to another table so she had to wait till they made it all over again. My steak was Burnt, my wife's side of the southwestern Mac and cheese didn't have everything on it. All steak orders he had were missing the butter on top 3 orders of fries. We order soup to be brought out before food we never got it. Service was slow. Sister in law ordered the steak with shrimp and she only got one shrimp  on it. Texas fries order only had like one or two jalapeños my niece had to ask for a side of them.

The visit prior to our LAST visit my husband and I went for our weekly ""fix"".   Our dinner was brought to us and my ""medium"" steak was very rare.  Waiter came to check on us 5-6 minutes after dropping off our food.  Told him about my steak. He took it back to the kitchen.  It came back to me 15 minutes later and was still raw.  My husband was done eating and I no longer was hungry.  Left very disappointed.   Not sure I wanted to go back.  3 weeks later we caved in and went back. Same thing with the steak.  Rare. Took back to the kitchen and 20 minutes later it was returned to me.  Cooked into oblivion. The ""manager"" who brought it must have been out sick when customer service skills were taught.  When I told him I could not eat that dried out over coked steak he simply picked it up and walked off.  Not a word was spoken to me. He never apologized.  Never said a thing. Since the rest of my dinner party was done eating I did not ""want to order something else"".  Left hungry for the second time in a row.   This is all so very disappointing.  Chilis was always our go-to place.  We liked that they were always consistent.  I really don't care if I ever go back there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-visalia-2?start=20,2.08,2.08,2.08,2.02,2.08

Time after time after time, I have a horrible experience with this location.  Having moved from a bigger city and having enjoyed Chili's before, this place is terrible. The staff is rude, doesn't listen and have attitudes. One time I came in with my wife and my 2 kids a my niece, we had to find someone to seat us. Then when we were seated, another couple was seated after us. The other couple had their drinks and order taken before anyone ever came to ask us if we needed drinks. (Don't want to say racist, but we are black and Hispanic and they were white.) I placed an order for Pick up, for a party up to 3 weeks in advanced and even double checked a week before and the day before. When I arrived at the time I requested, the staff looked stunned. I was eventually told that they made it yesterday, and they would get on it right away. Needless to say, I wasn't comped anything and I was 1.5 hrs late with people waiting. The last time , wife and I ducked in for a quick bite.  Wasn't very busy. Hostess asks if we wanted Bar or dining room. We said Bar, saw a table we wanted and when we asked if she could clean it, rolled her eyes with an attitude.  Table now cleared, but not wiped. Asked wait staff if they could wipe it off, again attitude.  Finally able to order food, placed order at 5:20, noticed fork had food on it and asked wait staff for a clean one. He returned stating that they were all out and handed me a plastic fork. (REALLY). Food finally arrived at 6:15. As he brought the food I had to ask for a box because we had to go now.  Everyone here needs to be fired and then rehire people who want to work and can be friendly no matter what and make sure the customers are happy.

So, because this staff did not acknowledge my presence, I had to wait an extra 15-20 minutes for nothing?? It is now 9:45pm and I am barely now receiving my order. ONE HOUR????? I can't believe it. My sister was so excited because she seen the ad on the commercial which is why we ordered here, now that this happened she isn't even excited to eat her food. And I just looked at my container box. You can tell that it says Mike written in pen, and Monica written on over that.

Their menu is now all over the place as they can't decide if they want to be a Mexican food/Tex-mex or an American diner or country kitchen or . . . Their menu reads as they want to please everyone, sacrificing quality. For this site specifically the hostess pushed us towards open seating in the bar despite the restaurant being fairly empty ""I CAN seat you, but if you want the bar is open"".  She just stared at us so we went to the bar. Our waitress came and took our order, but was also bartender and lord knows what else because she disappeared for 20 minutes with our drink glasses remaining empty during that time. Food was meh, even for the price. (Seriously Chili's stick to your Tex-Mex). Was only there because someone gave me a $50 gift card. After 45 mins I flagged down our waitress for the bill, gave her the gift card, she came back and had run the wrong table on it. Really I could have walked, our bill was $43, she charged us $26 (think it was the check for the table next to us) and even pointed out i had $24 left by handing me the receipt. At first I was confused but then saw a child's meal was on the ticket (no children here). I had to flag down another waitress after 5 minutes because again ours was MIA. Since it was a gift card she tried to do this weird math trying to correct the error by charging the gift card a particular amount leaving it with $4. I tried pointing out to her (doing math in my head) there should be $7 left. She said no, said she did the math on her phone, pulled it out again to show me, then screwed up again getting a third number. I just told her there should be $7 left and just to take the gift card and keep the rest as a tip. She thanked me for not skipping out. But still. Should not be this complicated.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-visalia-2?start=20,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72
36,Evan C.,"Porterville, CA",0,1,,1.0,2017-11-24,"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE MANAGEMENT, PLEASE FIX THIS ESTABLISHMENT!!!!!!! Here's a little background to my experience today. We had a party of 11 and we were celebrating my brother's 25th birthday. Our waiter was fabulous (his name was Jacob), but it was the manager who completely ruined it for us. We all ordered our food and after about an hour of waiting, the food came out and we were all anxious to eat. Only problem was, there was 2 meals missing. We were then told that our 2 meals ""disappeared"" from the order and that they were never even prepared. Aggravated, but still holding it together, we said it was okay and that we would wait for the meals. After about 30 minutes, our meals STILL weren't finished. Finally, after exactly 55 minutes, our plates came to our table. They were both wrong. At this point, we ask to speak to a manager. This manager never once asked us about how our experience was going, but asked both tables around us. As soon as he comes over, we explain to him that it's been over 2 hours and we barely received our meals, and they weren't even correct. Our whole table was already finished eating by this time. The manager tells us the same story, that our orders ""disappeared"" and that it was due to bad WiFi internet connection. He didn't even offer to give us any sort of gratitude for the horrible service. We then demand that something be done. The manager finally realizes that all we wanted to do was have an enjoyable dining experience; which we weren't even close to receiving. The manager, with an angry tone, says that both the last 2 meals would be removed from the ticket. This was a sigh of relief, but not the end. It took almost another HOUR for them to sort our tickets correctly. The manager, who coincidentally stayed on the other side of the restaurant after our verbal altercation, was seen watching his waiters try to figure out our incorrect tickets. The manager didn't offer any sort of help to his poor waiters, and in the end, made the task that much more difficult. All he had to do was what any ethical manager would do, handle the situation. Instead, he never once came back to us asking if the problem had been corrected. Finally, the tickets were properly split up and we paid them all. Again, I want to let all of you know that our waiter was AMAZING, and he did everything that he could for us. It was the manager who should've taken care of us after the problem persisted. If you've read this far, then you understand why my family and I will never be coming to this restaurant (which we all once loved and enjoyed) again. I don't recommend anybody come here unless they want a horrible experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-visalia-2,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68
27,Jeanette A.,"Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",599,15,58.0,4.0,2017-11-27,"Came here on a Saturday evening (after Black Friday) and surprisingly it wasn't crazy busy! *This restaurant is located in a nice location too, right on Mooney in the Target shopping center. Inside the restaurant, the booths happened to be occupied but bar tables were open. *Self seating in the bar area. Atmosphere is casual but good to bring friends or family because of the moderate noise level. The service was pretty decent. Our waitress checked in regularly, was polite, and didn't forget anything which is always nice. The food was all pretty tasty, I love the southwestern eggrolls so that was why we chose to eat here. I guess it's been a while since I've been to a Chilis because it seemed like the menu was revamped a bit and lots of new items added. I tried a menu item I hadn't tried before (the chicken and waffles,) and surprisingly it was really good! I couldn't eat many of them because they're filling and taste rich but I would probably order them again as well. Another good menu item here is the chicken fajitas. We sent ours back because we like the chicken ""more grilled"" but it wasn't a problem and the waitress corrected it. Last, my favorite dessert here is the chocolate molten cake, the chocolate is really good especially on the inside! Overall it was a good experience and I would recommend this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-visalia-2,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
25,Elvie D.,"Fresno, CA",0,5,13.0,1.0,2017-12-08,"The food was terrible! We asked the waitress for the chips & salsa that we remembered were served. The waitress brought them out & was missing for most of the visit. When the check came I asked why I was being charged for chips, it was then that she let me know they are no longer complementary & there was nothing she could do even though she did not mention it was an appetizer & NOT complimentary. I asked to speak to the manager, after a little back & forth he said he'd give me a discount, he was rude & seemed reluctant to help me out, & before I could even finish saying ""I appreciate your assistance"" he left mid sentence without even saying ""have a good night"" or anything like that. Also I didn't understand why he was so rude when all he gave me was a $1 discount. Lost several customers for $1! Buffalo Wild Wings is right next door, GO THERE!

Went there today with our family and the server was incredibly slow and was inattentive, no refills on our drinks til last minute she was hardly checking on us. I prefer an "" annoying server"" that's always asking if we need anything. Also she didn't have a name tag on or even introduce herself to us. Super awkward server experience. But if you ever go into chilis request Nicole if shes working shes great!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-visalia-2,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72
23,Lenore L.,"Pleasanton, CA",43,247,17.0,5.0,2017-12-28,Stopped in for dessert. I saw they have a new caramel cake so asked if they could put caramel on the chocolate plus add extra scoop of ice cream. Courtney was so so sweet! She made a beautiful creation exactly like I asked for. We are very delighted and happy with our dessert experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-visalia-2,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88

The restaurant was clean, the staff was friendly, our waitress was friendly and attentive, the quality of the food was above average, and the price was great.  We went for the two for $22, great selection of meals and yes the price went up from their previous two for $20 but thanks for the California voters who voted to raise minimum wage well what did we expect was going to happen? Overall great experience and we will be back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-visalia-2,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005
20,Jim M.,"Visalia, CA",51,34,6.0,5.0,2018-01-02,"Ate here on Christmas Eve. We were seated as soon as they could setup a table for our group, 5 adults and 5 children (all 4 and under). Crazy right? Our server was fairly new, within 2 months. She did an outstanding job. She watched our table to be sure the little ones had drinks and the food came out fast. I am gluten free. The staff always knows what to do. They make sure my order is handled properly. The Ribs and Smashed potatoes are fantastic.   It was a great meal and great service as always.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-visalia-2,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005
