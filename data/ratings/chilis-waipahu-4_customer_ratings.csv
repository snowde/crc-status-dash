293,Tracie F.,"Redondo Beach, Los Angeles, CA",352,690,57.0,4.0,2012-03-20,"I always find it hard to rate chain restaurants. For the most part the food is generally consistent as is the service. Sometimes the servers (and restaurant in general) have a bad day and I find it really hard to give a restaurant a poor rating based on an ""off"" day. This rating is an average of a number of visits.  Generally staff is pretty friendly and the service is usually on point. I have never been here when an item was not available. The restaurant is usually pretty clean as is the bathroom. One thing I really like about this location is the fact that they tend to honor mainland deals more than the other Chili's (namely Kapolei). I will not even start my rant about businesses that do not honor deals in Hawaii. Overall, this is a pretty decent chili's. There are not a whole lot of eating options in the Waikele area so if you are going to dine while bargain hunting, I recommend that you do it here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waipahu-4?start=280,2.88,2.88,2.88,2.8640000000000003,2.88

304,Jessica-Nicole U.,"Honolulu, HI",1794,253,1103.0,4.0,2012-05-10,"So what can I really say about this restaurant that makes it a four star? I mean, it's hard to rate Chili's anything below a three anyways since they have such good food, and from my experience thus far, great service, at every restaurant I've been to. I think the restaurant in Mililani is much nicer with a great waiting area outside and just somehow a nicer ambience inside.  But this place deserves four stars because I've always had excellent service, no problem with parking and the food always came out right. Never had a bad or irritable time with anything. Temperature's about right too which matters a lot in my book. Very smooth... in and out... but I must say... I have no clue how this place is when it's super packed because I've never been here when it's really packed. I think I've been here overall of 8 times, so maybe it's the less busier Chilis?  Of course the food is great, but not much different from other Chili's food. My food always comes out fresh and sizzling/hot/cold. So not problem with that. And I don't think I've ever had to wait.... Why not 5 stars? Ehhh... it's not perfect... it could be better. The bathroom's all the way on the right side in the back... kind of sucks for those all the way on the left side... and it's not very ""chill"" near the bar area since the restaurant entrance just seems so RIGHT THERE.

Or was I wrong in thinking we would get at least decent service at a chain restaurant. I thought they would at least have standards. The server was completely unfamiliar with any of the alcoholic drinks on the menu. Who doesn't know what's in a sangria? It was awful. When we wanted to pay the bill, the server messed up one of our checks. Instead of apologizing, she snatched our credit cards and receipts and left us not knowing what was going on. After 20 minutes we went to the kitchen to find out what was going on. With 5 servers plus the manager huddled behind the POS system, they still couldn't figure out how to fix the checks. The manager completely threw his employee under the bus and still didn't even apologize for the inconvenience. Needless to say, I'm surprised their employees aren't trained better because chilli's is such a big chain restaurant and I would think they're really corporate and have standards.

I live up in Mililani, but I frequent to the Waikele Chili's more often because there is usually less of a wait and it is a bit more quieter.   My bf and I love the baby back ribs.  I love the memphris rub, he goes for the original sauce.   I usually get corn and broccoli for the sides, but there are other choices such as sweet potato fries, cole slaw, rice, and mash potato.

207,Michael C.,"Honolulu, HI",378,724,4179.0,1.0,2012-11-06,"I was unsure whether or not to post this update, but in the end I felt it might be helpful to others and future customers: I had dinner with a friend at this location this past Saturday, November 3.  We were seated immediately and received more than satisfactory customer service throughout our entire visit.  In the end, I decided to use my debit card to pay for the meal since I did not have enough cash.  My friend and I decided to leave a cash tip, and as I have always done in the past I drew a line thru the tip section/line on the check to signify that I WAS NOT leaving a tip on the card.  I then wrote in the total ($44.55) to be charged on the card and we left the restaurant. Today, Monday, November 5, as I was checking my banking statement online, I discovered the total deducted for Chili's that night was $10 more than the bill.  At first I was upset to discover this, but came to my senses and called the bank, who then instructed me to call Chili's.  I spoke to the manager and he took down all the necessary information so he could research the transaction.  It turns out the server keyed in the wrong amount into their computer (or so the manager says), and therefore my card was charged for $54.55, with $10 being recognized as a tip.  His apology seemed genuine when he said was sorry for the inconvenience, and that the server was not a dishonest person and made a very careless mistake.  He informed me that they could credit back the $10 but it would take at least 2 days since this transaction had to be processed thru their corporate office in California.  He said he would call me to let me know when the transaction had been completed. Bottom Line:  I guess the moral is to double-check your credit card statements and/or banking statements for the correct amount processed.  I'm not terribly upset since the manager was helpful, but I'm very, very disappointed, and will most likely stay away from this location in the future.

233,Joei G.,"Mililani, HI",291,58,72.0,3.0,2013-06-06,"Well this place is okay.... What I liked, the taste of the food, the menu items, and the pretty (sorry if this is superficial) and nice servers. Okay I guess I will start off with the good and end with the bad.  First off when I went that evening for dinner I ordered the salmon and baby back ribs combo. Both were very delicious. I enjoyed every single bite. The fish was cooked nicely and the bbq ribs were sweet and tangy the way I like it.  Besides what I had eaten, it was a bit hard to pick what I wanted. They have a nice selection and I will definitely go back to try other stuff.  Now lastly for this section the service, the food came out at a decent time and the server was very nice.  Now for the negative. In this review I place the negative last because this is a chain restaurant so certain negatives are expected. These restaurants have to do really bad in order to lose business. This restaurant is okay... Let me start first with what is not really under their control. This is the Waikele location, so expect parking to be somewhat annoying during the peak hours. The area they are in is small and gets quite congested at times. Since this is partly the fault of the designers of this shopping center I will not count this against them too much. Next let me get to the food. Like I said the food was good, but for the price the servings were way too small. Seriously, the quality was nothing spectacular even though it was very tasty. But then again maybe I'm a bit cheap. But the ribs were barely meaty, it almost seemed like most of the taste was from the bones, and the slice of salmon could have been a bit bigger. The combo was almost $25, but in my opinion it should probably only have been $16 or $17 tops. I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who feels the same, but oh well let's just see how it goes for them with these prices. Now as I have mentioned I will probably come back. I will definitely choose a different selection and the food will most likely be tasty. Now I leave it to you to decide whether or not you feel like paying a little but extra for nothing special. I do not mean to sound very negative if that is how I came out. But like I said I did enjoy the food and service, but it's just the pricing is debatable. Anyways, I hope you have a pleasant experience if you choose to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waipahu-4?start=300,2.84,2.84,2.84,2.476,2.84

We asked our server about the $9.99 email & she said that people have been asking about the $9.99 prices all day, but that they do not participate in that offer.  We even showed her the email and said that NO WHERE on the email did it say, participating locations only (or something similar to that).   She said that they are a franchise and so they don't participate.  She said that only the Waikiki location was participating in that offer.  We were irked, but didn't push it any further.  We ordered 4 of the Triple Dippers and then when we got our bills, we were charged $13.99 each. When we asked about the incorrect price, she told us that $13.99 was the price. We said why does your menu say $12.99? She said that it was ringing up as $13.99 and she didn't think there was any specials going on, but she would check with her manager. She came back & said that there was a special and it was $12.99 and that she would change our checks. She said she just thought that the menu was wrong. H E L L O !! The food was yummy as always and our server was nice & attentive to our needs (refilling drinks, etc).  Just think she should be aware of the current specials.  However I'm still irked about the false advertising so I rated this experience low :-(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waipahu-4?start=280,3.08,3.08,3.08,2.568,3.0800000000000005
279,Emy R.,"Kapolei, HI",1126,91,1401.0,2.0,2013-09-29,"I don't know why my experiences with Chili's always ends up with overly salted food. One of our friends was being sent TAD (temporary assigned duty) to the Middle East and someone made the decision to meet here since it was more convenient for everyone. I wasn't too thrilled but oh well.  There probably isn't much I can say about Chili's that hasn't already been said. Chain restaurant, usually crowded especially on the weekends. Reservations are recommended and even with reservations you might have a bit of a wait. Tends to get noisy and the AC is on full blast so bring a light jacket if you are like me and tend to get cold with AC.  On this night I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak on the suggestion of a friend who claimed it was ""really good"" and said that's all he orders when he eats at any Chili's. Since he seemed to be the authority on Chili's cuisine (he and his wife apparently go every weekend) I decided to take the plunge and go for it. BIG MISTAKE. I should've stayed in my safety zone and ordered a burger.  My plate looked like a plate of barf, there was chunky white gravy everywhere and it was super salty. At first I thought it was the gravy so I ate around the gravy but the Chicken Fried Steak was still salty and so were the mash potatoes. I hardly touched my food and the friend who suggested it also said it was too salty and only ate half of his. When the waitress came to clear the table she asked if I wanted to box my food but I told her it was too salty. She did offer to have something else made but I declined.  The pros - friendly and attentive service & they make a pretty darn good beer-garita. For me, Chili's certainly isn't on the top my list of places that I have to eat at. Food is meh. If I do end up at a Chili's again, will stick to a burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waipahu-4?start=260,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.6320000000000006,3.0000000000000004
330,Ed K.,"Honolulu, HI",0,4,,1.0,2013-10-01,"First time ever at a Chili's and for sure will never eat at this one again - and while I might try one somewhere else (mainland) at some point, there's no burning desire to do that, except to test my theory that franchise restaurants in Hawaii are generally pretty horrible and nothing like they are supposed to be. (I ate at the Red Lobster in Waikiki once and everything about it was horrible and nothing like any of the Red Lobsters I've been to on the mainland.) What really ticks me about this Chili's is that my credit card was charged $2 more than the total I put down. I did call the store and they said it was a mistake. I don't see how it could be a mistake, but guess maybe give them the benefit of doubt....? They said they'll send it to home office in California and the $2 will be credited back... we'll see. My advice - if you use a credit card, make sure to check that what gets billed is correct (there's another Yelp review below with a $10 overcharge - and how many people will bother to check and then write about it????) The food was a huge disappointment: didn't know what to order as first time here - but I did the Chicken bacon ranch quesadilla. It was dry. Horrible. Partner did spicy grilled shrimp taco - it was better, but not enough sauce, rice not good, and the main ingredient - the shrimp - not good quality. Service was not great - while server checked back almost immediately after food was delivered, we wanted drinks and never could get attention of server until it was time to pay the bill.

Moreover, the beverages they offer completely compliments their meal!! Total YUM!

We always get the molten chocolate cake with the hard-cover chocolate (which is the ice cream being shelled by chocolate goodness) that is oozing with caramel and chocolate!  And!

I used our check in and got the free chips and queso.  Highly recommended as the chips are fresh and the queso is something out of the ordinary.  I had the mushroom swiss burger with onion strings.  The burger was moist with lots of flavor from the mushrooms and cheese.  I would say pass on the onion strings and get fries instead.  Onion strings were more oil than anything else.  My wife got the bacon advacado chicken sandwich.  Yum!  My son got the big bites which he loved.  It's 4 bar burgers/sliders that come with chopped up bacon and onions.  If you have young kids they can probably share this.  2 each.  Guaranteed they will love it.  My daughter tried the cheese quesadillas with corn on the cob on the side.  All smiles!  Total price $50. Overall a great restaurant for a family with young kids.  In fact there were a lot of families there today for lunch. Oh and what really impressed me was the unlimited refills on soda and they bring NEW cups every time.  I am a germaphobe so I like the fact that they don't bring my used cup back to the soda machine to refill it.  If they don't bring my cup back then that means they don't bring other customers' cups back as well.  2 thumbs up for that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waipahu-4?start=180,3.88,3.09,3.09,3.2520000000000002,3.406

The waitress was nice, but to no fault of hers, the cooks were awful. We ordered our drinks and appetizers, and when the Texas cheese fries came out, it was not... acceptable. I am not usually one to send things back, but I sent those cheese fries back as soon as she set them on the table. They were burnt, the cheese was no where to be seen, and it looked like it was sitting under the warmer light for an hour. She brought us another Texas fries, which looked a little better, but not by much. My order was for 2 enchiladas, with ""all rice"" (no beans). When my plate came out, it looked like they started to put beans on the plate, then removed the beans to give me all rice. It looked like a skid mark of beans on the edge of the plate.

Rather, I have now been propelled into the DIY restaurant check era, whether I wanted to or not.  Our last visit was before Christmas.  Since then our local Chili's has installed a unique interactive video device called the ""Ziosk.""  I'm told this is common on the US Mainland, but it's new to us in Hawaii.  The host that seated us gave us a quick user demonstration/operational checkride on how we could reorder our bar drinks that we didn't order to start with, order dessert before we even met our server, get calorie information on menu items (if we were worried about calories we wouldn't be at Chili's), pay our bill including tip, and best of all, play video games while waiting or eating ($1.99 each).  I noticed there's an e-mail function also...don't even want to imagine how that worked.   Excuse me, but if I want all that meal-time video I'll go to my son's house for dinner, which would be delightful since he lives in Portland OR and has a wonderful wife. So we completed our meals, ordered a piece of cheesecake to take home, and were presented with an inventory of our orders with cost (as opposed to the traditional meal check).  Our server would happily take cash, but if we wanted to use a credit card...then we have to deal with Mr Ziosk.  Now check out the photo...can you see all the fingerprints on the Ziosk, not to mention a couple unidentifiable organic substances permanently attached to the screen?  I am relatively okay with the DNA I currently have, don't need anyone else's, thank you.  I have to say I was eager to get home and wash my hands once that Ziosk transaction was complete. About that transaction...once you're handed a check, that white-light area at the top center of the screen turns bright red.  After you pay it turns green...a color-coded, guilt-driven collection enforcement system!  If we got up and left before paying it probably would have set off sirens, red and blue flashing lights, and laser fire across the aisle.  But we did pay, and then it thoughtfully suggested a 20% tip which I felt duty-bound to pay, since we did have a nice server as usual.  You can slide the on-screen tip scale left and right for smaller or larger percentages, but that would require additional contact with that screen. As it is, I'm still getting used to sliding my credit cards in grocery and department store card readers, gas pumps, et al, so this didn't have a huge comfort factor for me.  Except...pretty soon we're eligible for a smart phone upgrade and an iPhone 6 is definitely in our future.  Apple Pay...just touch that screen...someday.  Okay, that's a leap I can make.  Like paying for Starbucks with my current iPhone 5 (we are so-o 2013) by scanning my secret gold card barcode...way cool.  I wouldn't go to Starbucks even a fraction of the times I do now if I couldn't pay with my iPhone!  So maybe the next time we go back to Chili's we can just hold our iPhone 6 on Mr Ziosk and the two can make nice without actually touching that screen.  It's a step in the right direction, I guess. Oh, and the food at Chili's was great as usual, and so were the staff.  Kicking and screaming into the 21st century!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waipahu-4?start=200,3.44,3.22,3.22,2.8600000000000003,3.3080000000000007

When she gave our onion rings to us she asked ""do they look okay?"" The chopped parsley that were sprinkled on top of the rings were also old and the rings were really dark brown.

157,Amber-Lynn H.,"Honolulu, HI",631,115,212.0,1.0,2015-07-14,"Positive streak broken, Chili's to go FAIL. Picked up some food for a friend & I to indulge in some guilty pleasures while watching the sunset on the north shore. And being that Chili's Waikele has been super on it the last few months, I was happy to order from them. Ordered a burger no red onions and the triple dipper (onion rings, cheddar bites, Boneless chicken wings). Simple. Not so much. While I was on the phone with Tim, he didn't ask about how I wanted the burger cooked. No problem. So I let him know I wanted the burger cooked to medium (meaning some pink in the middle). He didn't get what I was asking for and had me repeat it 3 more times. I was able to pick it up 15 minutes after calling it in. I get there and Tim confirms only the burger part of my order repeating no red onions & cooked medium, but only said triple dipper when confirming the 2nd half. Didn't think anything of it until now. But seriously, why not just be consistent and follow through if you think it's important to make sure it's right. Well, here we are opening up the food...the triple dipper had big mouth bites. Not crispy cheddar bites. Mind you, which sounds nothing alike aside from the ""bites."" Normally I'd be flexible and just go with it. But let's get to the regular sized burger we ordered....it was cooked well done. When you bit into it it was not tender, juicy like a medium burger would be. It was chewy, crumbly and on the dry side. Big appetite turn off. And if they can't get the regular burger right, it's hard for me to believe they could get the mini burgers right. Huge disappoint and an even bigger waste of money. I wonder if take out orders are served at a lesser standard where quality doesn't matter.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waipahu-4?start=120,3.32,3.35,3.35,2.6920000000000006,3.338

The last time I was at this location was over 2 years ago. Not because I didn't like the food or anything. But because I like closer to the pearlridge one. Either way, a LOT has changed since my last visit. The menu has a bunch of new, delicious and hard to choose from choices. They have a new system where you have a small ipad-like tablet on your table and you could use it to order drinks (and food items) from your table. You can also play games and pay from there by swiping your card. Need a receipt? Not a problem! It pop's a little one out for you. If this thing made phone call I'd start to think that Steve Jobs isn't dead but simply hiding out at Chili's. I played it safe and just got a bacon burger. My girlfriend got a taco trio sampler thing. It sounded good but was a bit on the disappointing side. However, the tablet felt a little (very small very tiny detail) grimy. A quick wipe down after the people leave would be a good choice is all. Now aside from the food and the new items and apple products. The best thing about my recent visit was my server. Her name was Melissa and she was amazing! She knew everything and walked us through the menu and the tablet. If we had questions she wouldn't stammer or stutter, she knew the exact answer. She anticipated our every need, check on us enough times and didn't bother us. She did such a great job that we told her manager how good she was. Even she agreed with us.

I just wish Chilis would have ""warned"" parents, I dunno, cause some parents limit screen time and dangling awesome new entertainment in front of kids is just asking for trouble. Now let's get to the food... We love their burgers!! We almost always get them because they sub broccoli for free as a healthy alternative. Yet, they got my entire order wrong. I ordered broccoli, they have me fries. I wanted the new turkey guac burger no mayo. I got a regular burger. I just ate it cause I was still upset about the media thing and I was pretty hungry. I told the waitress, she offered to send it back, but I was already halfway done so oh well. I would have liked more to be done. Sending it back would have only made me wait longer to eat, thus making my kids wait longer for me, and allowing them more media time...see where this vicious cycle ends?

We figured its mid-day, there should be a happy hour with some great deals. Well there is, but only M-F (3-6) - today was Saturday.  So, we arrive and were seated right away. Great. We were pleasantly greeted by our server Tim. He was a great server and I was very impressed. We looked over the drinks menu and I ordered the Grapefruit Margarita (sounds amazing right?) and Caitlyn ordered the Blueberry Pineapple Margarita. It really bothers me that there is no prices on their drink menu. Why do they not put prices on there? Oh yes, because the drinks are completely over priced. We payed ~$12-13 for our margs and they were about 16oz. Ugh. We checked in on Yelp and got the free chips and queso/salsa. SCORE. The menu has a lot more choices and a variety of choices than the last time I visited. It is completely overwhelming but I am extremely pleased they offer more vegetarian items. They have a blackbean burger that you can substitute on any of their burgers.  I ordered the Quesadilla Explosion Salad. I have always loved this salad but hate ordering it and paying $13 when I don't get the chicken. Tim was so nice when I told him I didn't want the meat and he asked if I wanted avocado instead. YES! I was so happy, this was the first time that I actually had someone ask (at Chilis) if I wanted something substituted because I don't eat meat. A+ Tim!  We also ordered fried pickles and the sampler with fried cheese, buffalo wings (for Caitlyn) and spring rolls. The buffalo wings were below average. The friend pickles were great.

This site has a lot of parking and can accommodate the crowds from the nearby Premium Outlet Mall as well as several other smaller establishments.  There was a waitlist of 20 minutes which seemed reasonable since we noticed all of the tables in the dining room were full.  The hostess offered to seat us in the empty bar area where we could watch television, grab ourselves some cold beverages and probably be waited on right away.   While we waited for a server, the hostess began seating more people in the bar area along with us.   A friendly server came, introduced herself as the bartender and took our beverage order.  She returned quickly with our order and asked if we were ready to order.  We weren't quite ready, so understandably, she went onto the other tables.  It wasn't until after she had taken food orders for the other tables, most of which were large parties, that she returned to check on us and to take our order. The food was decent and eventually another worker came to assist the bartender by refilling our beverages and delivering our dishes.   We all had ordered their ""Big Mouth Burgers"" with fries.  Each of our burgers was nicely presented, flavorful and done to our liking. Sorry to say but we felt sorry for the poor gal as she was getting overwhelmed.  I know that she had no control over the amount of people coming in to dine but, the shift leader should have at least seen to getting more help into the bar area.  Service was pleasant but very slow. #497",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waipahu-4?start=60,3.32,3.35,3.35,3.2760000000000007,3.338

Yum! -Southwest Egg Rolls (2 cut in half): shredded chicken, black beans, and corn mixture, wrapped and deep fried. This comes with an avocado ranch dipping sauce.  -Cheese Bites: little pieces of mozzarella, lightly breaded and deep fried.

I had Triple Dipper and Southwestern Smokehouse Burger. The Tripple Dipper was a score. So much food for 14 bucks. I couldn't finish it all because of our free queso and chips. It was the same story with my girlfriend. We took it home. The customer service was nice enough to come and ask for boxes.  I would definitely come here again for some drinks and the dripple Dipper.

There was no wait, and was seated right away. It was my boyfriend and I and my sleeping son in his stroller and they gave us a booth to accomodate his stroller which I love! We were asked if we wanted drinks as we sat and were checked on a lot along with many water refills without us having to ask. To start off we got the appetizer trio with the egg rolls, boneless buffalo wings, and onion rings and it was brought fresh and hot to our table within 5-10 minutes. We ordered the chicken crispers, side mac and cheese, extra honey mustard sauce, and the shrimp and steak fajita.

They have double doors for the entrance/exit. The hostess at the stand saw us walking out hands full and everything and said ""Thank you!!... OH"" and nothing after as she just watched us struggling to get everything through the double doors. I've been a hostess before.

32,Chablis T.,"Waipahu, HI",9,45,64.0,1.0,2017-01-05,"Kiosk review: Solely based on kiosk card payments.  MAKE YOUR OWN CALCULATIONS.  It automatically adjusts the suggested tip to 20%. However ""their"" calculated 20% is marked up to approximately 25%.  That's a lot of money taken from tourists & locals that frequent this location who don't know any better. I definitely support tipping our servers and will overtip for their service most times. It's not right to be fooled into over tipping.  UPDATE: The business manager Mickey had reached out to me to explain how their kiosks work. Basically if you have a coupon (which I didn't have). The kiosk will calculate your tip based on the entire total bill BEFORE the discounted prices to ensure that the servers are being tipped for the food they serve. Ok...I get that. So if they void an item on your receipt because of a mistake with the order taken your tip will still be automatically calculated as if you had ordered that item. In other words, just calculate your own tip rather than paying what they recommend. I can guarantee that everyone at the establishment knows how the kiosk system is set up. Not accusing anyone that they make voids on purpose. But! It's a slick move to keep voiding items to increase the tip amount assuming the customer doesn't check and just hits ok to the automatically suggested/adjusted ""20%"" amount.  After looking at my receipt, there were voids. Because the server took my order wrong and had to ring the correct order up again. It adjusted to calculate my tip on the entire bill before the voids. Which is why my tip calculated higher.  No change in stars because from what I'm told the kiosk system is out of their control at the store level. However, the manager was kind enough to explain the reasons behind it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waipahu-4?start=60,3.84,3.76,3.432,3.5560000000000005,3.792

Upon arriving, we were seated by the hostess & introduced to our AMAZING waitress, Kristen  Kristen was so polite, sweet and energetic, & never failed to check on us throughout the evening. So fast forward to after receiving our order.. being 3 1/2 months pregnant, I had to order my steak WELL DONE & cause the cravings for mashed potatoes was REAL... I ordered 2 sides (replacing the broccoli with mash) of the loaded mash. She hadn't brought out the food to us (another waiter had) but that didn't bother us. I cut into the meat and honestly couldn't really tell if it was well done or not, cause I'm always a medium rare kind of girl and it seemed OKAYYYYY to me. But a little while later... she came to check on us and she was like ""Oh no girl, that is NOT well done! I'm taking that back for you. I'm so sorry"" I don't like to be a person that ever has to send my food back so I wouldn't have said anything when I did start noticing a lil bit of a pinker meat. Anyhow, she took it to the back, brought me back a side of mash to munch on in the meantime while they made me a whole new 10 Oz steak! She apologized again and reassured me my food would be out shortly. The manager then brought me out my new plate, with 2 sides of mash as well! It was like I hadn't even previously had a plate at all! But I very well did finish one whole side of mash on the first plate as well as half through the steak. Upon making sure the steak was well done, the manager apologized again & offered us free dessert on her. Their service was ABOVE AND BEYOND... they were all very energetic, polite, and showed sincerest apologies when I didn't even feel they needed to apologize that much but appreciated it. That is exactly how customer service should be done  I would highly recommend this location and of course, my brothers & sisters in Christ love Chilis! So I would recommend Chilis overall.

We went on a Monday around 1pm. We were seated quickly so that was great. We had the cheese fries with extra jalapeño. I have to say, they were delish. I would def have them again. Sadly, our meals were not on the same caliber. I ordered cheese enchiladas. Barely edible. It tasted like it was loaded with sliced american cheese. The rice was either undercooked or fried too long as it was hard. I don't like black beans so can't comment on that. The kid had 1/2rack of ribs with rice. Her rice was hard as well. The ribs had little meat and lots of inedible parts. My man ordered the 3pc something or other. Spring rolls, fried pickles and 2 sliders. He saved his food for dinner as he was already full from the appetizers. The pickles def had a tangy punch when you chewed it. The slices were thicker than what you would traditionally get at a bar. The dip it came with was good. So I'd rate the pickles as ok. Can't tell u about the spring rolls or sliders. Ut since he ate them later that night, I'll assume they were ok. Our waitress came and refilled our drinks several times, so a plus for service. Also, having checked in on Yelp, we received a free basket of chips and salsa with a bean dip. Not a meat eater, I realized I was chomping on something that felt ""meaty/chewy"". It was confirmed so I stopped eating it. But the bean part was tasty. I also don't care for super thin chips, so not a deal-breaker.  If we went again, I'd stick to my usual of veggie burger. Can't go wrong with a standard. I'll leave the Mexican dishes to a Mexican restaurant as well. And ribs...well, a rib or steakhouse joint.

As I waited for my meal, the manager, Mickey, came over to the table to apologize and offered a bowl of soup while I waited.

My 7 year old son immediately went to play unlimited games on the Ziosk for $1.99. Our server, Maxie, appeared with a friendly smile to introduce herself and take our drink order. I think they changed their kids' cups because it was bigger and the kind you can't take home. I personally prefer the new cup because my son drinks a lot and we don't need more of them at our house. I was a little bummed they no longer had the buffalo cauliflower but consoled myself with their triple dipper with my favs of south western egg rolls, honey chipotle tenders, and panko onion rings. My son ordered the bacon quesadillas. I also decided to try their new black cherry lemonade. Definitely no disappointment there until maybe when it's replaced by a new flavor. I decided to check in on yelp and what do you know, free chips and queso! Oh my, just another appetizer my son fell in love with. Maxie was super awesome about bringing that out promptly and even refilling the chips and salsa.

In the 30 minutes of us waiting she continued to serve other tables as we tried getting her attention. My bf and I decided if she didn't come to our table by 9:15 we were over it. (We didn't even have waters) but by the grace of god, a different server comes to us and helps us. Didn't catch his name, but he has braids. He turned our night upside down, his service was INCREDIBLE. He was constantly apologizing and rushing through all his tables, you could tell he was picking up the slack from others I mean he picked up our table when our original server didn't bother to do her job. He kept making sure we were alright and took care of us. We appreciate your hard work, mahalo for the good service man!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waipahu-4?start=20,3.76,4.15,3.868,,3.994

Our waitress, Mexi was very on point this evening. My husband usually has very high standards when it comes to dining in especially with our 6 children, but we were able to enjoy ourselves for a change! No kids screaming and yelling and running around thanks to the kiosk games they have! Mexi was very attentive and always checking in on us! She is very friendly and we could use more of her!!!

We were shopping out at the outlet stores and decided to stop in for an early dinner. We were seated at the bar area for some reason. It was a bit loud with several TVs playing and multiple people at the bar. Our server, Jessica, was a very prompt and sweet. We ordered some ice tea for drinks, followed by the shrimp and steak fajitas for dinner. My daughter really enjoyed the fajitas. For dessert we had the chocolate molten lava cake. The cake was very chocolatey and moist, definitely a good choice for dessert. Other than the restaurant being a bit too loud, it was a good experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waipahu-4,3.84,4.13,3.864,,4.014

57,Dynamite D.,"Waianae, HI",0,3,4.0,2.0,2017-12-26,"I love Chili's but this time, I wasn't satisfied with our food. We waited for our food for one hour 1/2, this was the longest i waited for a food to be serve. And when we finally receive our food, it wasn't that hot or warm enough, the rice we got was hard as well. I wasn't able to enjoy it so I barely touch it, I guess our server saw how disappointed I was, so she was trying to give us free dessert as an apology for the wait... she explained that they were short so their manager was the one on the kitchen helping so I wasn't able to talk to him. I'll give two star for our server since she was trying her best to satisfy our needs, but overall dissatisfied the way they serve our food, I don't mind waiting but to wait that long and be served with food that is not even warm is just too much. I think it will be a while before I come here or not at all. And I'm not sure what's their definition of busy cause it didn't even looked packed inside.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waipahu-4?start=40,3.72,4.13,3.868,,3.9660000000000006
18,Aurora G.,"Honolulu, HI",48,16,21.0,4.0,2018-01-05,"Went there for our first Thursday of the year Women's Ohana group fellowship.  Our server ""Anthony"" took very good care of us, we appreciated his service being that we were a party of 7 women.  3 of the sisters ordered the Triple dipper appetizer, 2 ordered the 2 courses for just $17.99, and I ordered the Caribbean salad with shrimp. It was nice that we were given complimentary chips and salsa, as a few of us were already hungry.  I did't realize till after I had already eaten my salad that there were no dried cranberries on it.  I brought that to Anthony's attention and he was apologetic about it.  Oh well, my fault for not telling him when I first got the salad.  The last sister that arrived ordered a salad and the chicken avocado flat bread which I tried to find on the menu and could find it?  Will need to find out if Chili's has a happy hour special on the appetizers, like maybe half off during a certain time frame.  It was quite busy this night, but we all enjoyed ourselves.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-waipahu-4,3.68,4.12,3.88,,3.944

But the reason why I bumped up my rating to a four stars without even stepping foot into the doors yet is the fact that the manager had the patience to listen to my frustrations and tried to make things better. No excuses were given, just a simple apology for my experience. I left our conversation feeling valued and appreciated.
