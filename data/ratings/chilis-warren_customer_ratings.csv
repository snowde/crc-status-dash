12,Justin H.,"Warren, MI",5,10,,1.0,2012-04-24,"Went there twice. The first time we had about 6 people for a birthday party. It was not busy at all and they took forever to get us drinks, appetizers, and our food. We thought it would be quick and it took us 2 1/2 hours! Terrible service!! Then we went last night. We only had 3 people. They sat us, again not busy, and we waited and waited and waited. We sat there for 30 minutes, ask 4 times for a server, which passed us multiple times, and finally got up and left. The hostess that sat us acted like we had eat already... I will never go there ever again. Usually didn't have bad servers in the past but they have lost my family and friends business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-warren?start=40,1.4760000000000002,1.4760000000000002,1.4760000000000002,1.4760000000000002,1.4760000000000004
3,Matthew K.,"South Lyon, MI",25,306,26.0,4.0,2013-05-15,"Better than Applebees (at least, when comparing the Warren locations).  But still high calorie, high fat food.  Although some of their under-500 calories dishes looked appealing, it's a shame they're over $10 for a lunch when you can get a filling (albeit calorie dense) lunch for $6 off their specials menu.  It's pretty obvious they're catering to the fat crowd, which is a shame. I ordered the Guacamole burger and my wife ordered the quesadilla lunch special with the loaded potato soup.  We enjoyed the food, although my burger was already getting soggy by the time it was delivered.  We had a free dessert coupon and went for the molten fudge cake w/ice cream.  A 1000 calorie monster!  Which I'm ashamed to say we finished, haha! I've never had bad service at this Chilis, and the food is at least consistently good.  I couldn't handle going here more than once every few months, but it's a guilty pleasure we like hitting up occasionally.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-warren?start=40,1.7760000000000002,1.7760000000000002,1.7760000000000002,1.7760000000000002,1.7760000000000002

The thing that puzzles me with this place is that it's never overly busy when I'm in there.  The waitresses disappear for long periods of time.  The service is INCREDIBLY SLOW.  One time they didn't even have certain items that were on the menu.  That particular day the credit card machine was down. I'm taking this restaurant off of my list of go-to lunch locations in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-warren?start=20,1.576,1.576,1.576,1.576,1.576

I had a frozen raspberry, it was sweet but yummy & the boy had lime on the rocks and said it was strong.  The food choices were $3 or $5 for apps. Boneless wings were delicious, & BIG pcs of chicken. We also got the queso & chips which comes with salsa. It's a BIG serving! The chips were thin, fresh & amazing! The queso dip was amazing too. I will def go back for more.

31,Rachel F.,"Saint Clair Shores, MI",145,34,44.0,3.0,2014-05-28,"Of course the food is always the same. Which isn't the issue. The issue is the waitstaff. They now have these hi-tech monitors at every table that is able to take your food order after the waitress takes your drink order. So it's hard to get that personable feel from the person who is making sure your food is made properly and brought to you as soon as it's hot and ready. I tested how this new device would change how they interact with people. So, I didn't use it at all. NOTHING. It took a half hour for someone to come and ask me if I had placed an order or not. I suggest that Chili's would get rid of this device and get back to being a more personable feel.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-warren?start=20,1.6760000000000002,1.6760000000000002,1.6760000000000002,1.6760000000000002,1.6760000000000002

The entire experience, from the waitress to the food, was just horrible. The kitchen couldn't get the kids cheeseburger bites right - probably the easiest thing on the menu - they arrived with no cheese and the wrong side! That was a testament to the quality of what we received,  3 of the 4 meals that were ordered had to be sent back. My husband and I had cold meat and potatoes and RAW, hard-as-a-rock broccoli ... our waitress had to reenter the orders so that the kitchen would remake them and then didn't bother having them removed from our check until I pointed  it out so - had I not checked before handing over my credit card - I'd be paying $81 instead of $57. Talked to the manager, who only offered us one dessert or salad or soup while we waited for the kitchen to take a 2nd try at cooking correctly. Very insulting that no % was taken off the bill for poor quality food and experience and instead we were offered things we didn't order. Very slow night, we should have felt like royalty but instead felt anything but... $57 for very poor food and service, what a waste.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-warren?start=40,1.5720000000000003,1.5720000000000003,1.5720000000000003,1.5720000000000003,1.5720000000000003

The food is normally always delicious, no problems there. By biggest problem is the fact that three separate times now we have waited in the lobby for over FIVE minutes without anyone greeting us! I've already walked out once because of it. But this last time we waited, and five minutes later, the hostess decides to show up and act like nothing is wrong. You have 5 groups just standing around in your lobby blocking the door because no one knows what's going on! I can understand running to go get something or taking a break, but if you do that, can't you have someone else watch the front for you? Completely ridiculous. If you can, I recommend the one on Gratiot. Amazing service there.

The salad bowl lacked greens and there was hardly any chicken on it, it was mostly beans and rice, but mostly beans, so many beans I had to scoop out 3-4 spoonfuls to be able to taste any other flavors in the mix!

We are regulars at this restaurant because it is close to where my sister-in-law works. My ratings have taken a dive over that last few years because of the menu changes, especially the horrible rice. I sure wish they would change it. But what you need to know is that you can substitute another side dish for the rice. You never have to eat it again. Sorry, I got off track. Today's lunch was PERFECT in every way. We ordered off the 2 for $20 menu and had Margarita Chicken. We substituted the horrible rice with mashed potatoes and the black beans with broccoli. We ordered guacamole and chips for our appetizer, which also comes as part of the 2 for $20 deal. Every single thing was made to perfection. The chips were fresh, not too salty, and not greasy. The guacamole excited my sense of taste. We loved it! The chicken was so tender you could cut it with your fork and seasoned wonderfully. The mashed potatoes and broccoli were great, too. Best meal I have had there in a couple of years. I asked to speak to Angela Ferris, the manager. She came out and I told her today's meal was perfect and I asked who prepared our entrees in the kitchen. Sue made the guacamole and worked the prep station. Markus and Nino were the cooks of that outstanding chicken, mashed potatoes and broccoli. Kudos to the three of them. I raised my score from a 2 to a 4 because of today and I hope to receive more great food from this particular team of employees.

Yes, drinks still took too long to come to the table; however our wait person was friendly and competent. The food was good too. Yes, I expected my fajitas to be sizzling when they came to the table; but the food was plenty hot.  It was close to three stars but then the waitress asked if we wanted any chips and salsa to go. Four stars!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-warren,1.8,1.8,1.8,2.096,1.8000000000000003

51,Paul M.,"Royal Oak, MI",0,40,,1.0,2016-05-18,"The last time I patronized this place-about 4 months ago-the table charge card reader was not operating. So the waitress took all our cards/bills ostensibly to the register. Low and behold, I got a call from Visa a couple days later with a Fraud warning-somebody had purchased some cellphone time in two separate charges to the tune of around $ 500.00. I called Chili's and spoke with the manager and he apologized in a matter of fact manner. I couldn't remember the server's name and didn't want to identify the wrong person by mistake, so I let it go. I am 99% sure the fraud was committed by somebody at Chili's. I recognize this can happen anywhere in this day and age, but I was surprised it happened at a fast-food chain like Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-warren,1.72,1.72,1.72,,1.7200000000000002

Natalie took our drink orders and they were there on the table with in the next 2 minutes. Ordered chips and salsa (a MUST buy) were on the table with in two minutes. Chips were nice and warm and fresh, Salsa was mild, just like this gringo likes it.  Prime rib burrito was supreme-beef was tasty and tender. Friends order was  mis-ordered by the waitress, she apologized and reordered.  Bottomless drinks were unending, along with another free one to go.

From the time it takes to be greeted at the door, the greeting from the waiter/waitress and the time it takes to receive our orders. Everytime I come and have a bad experience here, I wait a good 6 months in hopes they got rid of the horrible servers. Needless to say, it doesn't work. This last time was the last time I get ignored and forgotten about. The waitress not only took 15 mins to even greet us, but also forgot about part of my order and wasn't seen again until my food was eaten. I also went the entire meal with an empty glass. Never checked on us, and spent the entire time in the kitchen chit chatting with staff. I'll find myself a new location.

I spotted this from the road, so we pulled in and went inside.  Oddly enough, we thought they weren't open yet because no one was here yet, but we were lucky enough to see that not only were they open, but we were the first patrons there. Hooray!!!!   Our server was a real nice gal who was friendly and nice.  Melvin hasn't been to Chili's in a long time and wasn't sure what to get, so between myself and the server, he was able to pick something out from the menu.  I went with the triple sampler, which is one of the dishes that I like to get when eating here because of the variety and price.  Melvin went with a steak (sirloin?) burrito and we both really enjoyed our time here.  Now, I'm sure it's a different crowd here depending on when you go here, but overall, it was a really good experience.  Would totally return in the future!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-warren,1.84,1.84,1.84,,1.8400000000000003

21,B W.,"Mount Clemens, MI",0,46,1.0,3.0,2016-11-26,"I went here at lunch time during the week. It was crowded with the GM Tech Center right across the street. I was greeted immediately and showed to a booth adjacent to the bar area. The waitress came over and asked for my drink order. I said just an ice water for now. She brought me an ice tea instead,  so I politely said , "" Just water will be fine"". She brought me back a water, so no big deal. Now this ifs the first time in a Chilis restaurant in at least 15 years for me. At that time I am certain I had some sort of Tex/Mex entrée.   I recently  saw some of their advertising and marketing materials that boasted how wonderful their burgers were. I never would have thought about chilis for a burger, but I had been on the hunt for a decent burger lately and was really looking forward to trying one. After looking over the menu Guacamole Burger sounder like a match for my cravings. Don't recall ever having Guac on a burger before. It came with French frys so I decided that would be good too. The frys came out first. (And it took a while). They were cold. I sent them back asking for some hot ones. They immediately brought me some fresh ones that were actually pretty good. The burger came out and my first impression was , damn that's small...especially for $10 bucks. I cut it in half. Ate the one half in about 3 bites. It was pretty good but a bit salty. Ate a few frys and then the other half. Oh, by now my water was gone and alas, so was my waitress. When I finally saw her she came out went to a different table looked right at me and went on her merry little way. I finally hailed down another waitress who went right over to this ""waitress sub station"" gtabbed a pitcher of water and a fresh glass for me. I watched my waitress walk right by this same area when she looked in my direction with my empty glass on the table. Oh, well...now that would have been to easy to satisfy me and secure her tip. I thanked the other gal for helping and asked if I pay up front or at the table. She said my waitress would be right there to take it up. After I imagine another 5 or 6 long minutes, the other helpful one came back took my money and brought back my change.  I really wanted to give a good review so my three stars may be a bit generous. I left a meager tip. I was in a good mood so they got the benefit of that .I guess I got to thinking that maybe I am being to harsh of a judge.  Unfortunately it did not leave me with that burning desire to return. Oh, well...maybe in another 15 years or so.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-warren?start=20,1.88,1.88,1.88,,1.88

I have been here (to this location) a few times and I was just here tonight, too. My BFF and I came in here for a dessert date! Our hostess told us there was a fifteen minute wait. She was very apologetic. My friend is pregnant so I looked behind us and there were booths for people waiting to be seated. I was like, ""No problem! We will be over there taking a seat."" The wait ended up being a lot less than fifteen minutes. Yay! It seemed like they just needed a few minutes to buss tables. No big deal. We sat down and were so impressed with the menu, we decided to order food and dessert. Our server was such a cutie:) He was very friendly, attentive, and was informative, as well. The food and dessert were amazing! We ordered chips and salsa, bacon ranch steak quesadillas, a chocolate chip skillet cookie, and an Oreo lava cake.

Does corporate know you are doing this? Update. The kitchen is overwhelmed. I just asked if we sit in the bar area. They are not letting anyone sit down. I think I see a manager now. Now we have a another 4 top open. Seated finally after asking multiple people and explaining to the people walking in that their is a wait even though there are open tables.

No one ever came back to ask how my meal was or if I wanted a box or dessert. I finally just gave up and paid on the Zoask and left.

52,Valerie T.,"Memphis, TN",0,4,1.0,1.0,2017-06-08,"Here from out of town.While eating at this restaurant today I felt a small sting on my leg. I didn't stop eating but suddenly I began scratching my leg.  Well I had some type of bite. From  what I don't know. I ended  up moving from the booth and sat at the bar to finish my meal. I had a huge fresh localized whelp on my right leg. The staff was somewhat concerned. I asked for ice to stop the itching and swelling. I was given that right away. As I held an ice bag with one hand finished my meal with the other I asked the young lady at the bar did she tell the manager. She replied yes, ""he say it must have been a mosquito"". She also said he was on the grill. I guess that meant cooking. Well it may have been or may not have been a mosquito. The fact was I was bit by  something while I sat at that booth. There was food and trash on the floor at the booth so there is no telling what it was flying or lurking around under that booth top. So a few moments later they sat a couple at that same booth with the same food and trash on the floor. I told the lady  at the bar I feel before they sat anyone else in that spot they needed to sweep that area and clean it of  the food and trash that's on the floor. She was nice and agreed with me. So when I got ready to leave I said to her you know  I'm not looking for anything free or anything but I feel it was very inconsiderate for the manager not to come out and at least check on me or see if it was something other than a mosquito that bit me. Needless to say I won't go back there again. Oh and it wasn't that busy that after each  customer the table tops as well as the surrounding floor area with trash and food could not be cleaned. I wanna call them nasty but I won't go there. I didn't walk in the door with this. But that's what I left with. #calltheexterminator!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-warren,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92

Gummy, greasy underfried chips, tasteless salsa, doughy, greasy quesadillas, over-salted bland soup, sad, old salad, tasteless dressing, limp cold french fries and don't even get me started on the cold, tasteless doughy tacos. It is obvious that their solution to trying to make something taste good is to dump cheese on top of it and hope for the best. It doesn't work.
