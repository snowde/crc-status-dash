How about? --- - wait forever to make my order - waiter brings my drink, but forgets water and cultery - wait forever and never see the guy - brings the food and I have to remind him I have no cultery and no water - run out of my drink -- and would probably have had another but alas the waiter is no where to be found - the food is messy -- one napkin -- you get the picture -- and no waiter, etc to get another one or two! - the restaurant was not busy but staff was busy chatting each other up instead of making sure clients were satisfied - finally was able to get the bill - waited a long time for someone to pick up the credit card - finally got the manager's attention and he did it and asked me if everything was ok - uh NO!!! - Was totally ridiculous -- he was as bad as the rest - chatting up the hostess - I mean people - get it together - the food was ok -- the service was brutal - I won't be back and won't recommend to others  Get with it folks.

I was never a big Chili's fan so I didn't expect much. This place was just a little bit better than I expected. We got a pretzel stick appetizer and that we actually pretty good. I got the Crispy Chicken Crisper's and they were well cooked and well seasoned, but I have had better. My mom got a burger and found it to be standard Chili's quality. The fries were good as well. Dessert was tasty as well. On a normal Chili's visit, it probably would have been so average that I wouldn't post a review, but I decided to make a exception for this time.

She simply just disappeared, and basically just dodged our table, which only consisted of myself and 14 year old niece, ordering simple meals and waters. Basically had to jump out from our table to get her attention, just for our check. I felt like I aged a couple years waiting for some sort of service. Honestly we could have been served and brought our check, left a nice tip, and been on our way. I don't think I have ever left less than a 25% tip, up until tonight.

9,T B.,"Marlborough, MA",0,18,,1.0,2015-06-14,"The whole Chili's chain has gone down hill ever since they removed the grills and replaced them with infrared conveyor belts. They call this the kitchen of the future. This is supposed to speed up the orders. They are trying to make their food like McDonald's so anyone without cooking skills can cook in their kitchen. The chicken and shrimp come out like they have been boiled and not grilled like the advertise in their menus. All of the pictures on the menus and TV commercials show grill marks as if the food is grilled. This is false advertising and Chili's should remove the word grill from their name and stop calling their food grilled. They call the chicken grilled in several dishes. Today we had chicken fajitas and this is the last time we will be eating anything at Chili's. The fajitas at Chili's used to be the best and now they are the worst. Next thing will be salsa from a can and chips from a bag. It's coming. Anything to cut costs and lower quality. Now with the tablets at the tables they want to eliminate the interaction with the servers.

11,Matt W.,"Westford, MA",0,24,,2.0,2015-10-02,"I love the food at the Chili's chain. But the Westford location is so incredibly disappointing. I went in around 7pm on a weeknight. The place was 2/3 empty, but for some reason I had to wait about 5 minutes for a table. I thought the hostess was pulling my leg at first. I didn't see a lot of my waiter, even though, again, the place was about 2/3 empty. I ordered a burger, which took at least 20 minutes. I wasn't in any hurry, but it seemed odd. The table next to me was a family of 4, and they had ordered before I walked in. A bit after my food arrived, they complained that they still hadn't received their food. I heard the waiter explain that their pasta sometimes takes 13 minutes to prepare, even though they'd definitely been waiting twice that time. The burger was so-so. Not bad, but nothing to write home about. All around, this was a disappointing visit and I don't think I'll be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westford,2.2,2.2,2.2,,2.2

So I came by at 640 and waited until 720 to finally get my raw burger and the worst chicken fingers I have ever seen. They didn't have any more breaded chicken, so they fried the chicken and it wasn't even halfway cooked.

5,Rich Z.,"Acton, MA",35,213,73.0,2.0,2016-06-05,"Was just at this location this evening. Probably our 10th visit.  Each time we resolve to not go back.  Not because of the quality of food. It's good for the most part. What this location lacks is service.  Each waiter or waitress is worse than the last.  It is clear that there is no manager on duty, and the staff is lacking basic training. Solution? 1. Get the order right.  Confirm it when the order happens so there are no mistakes, no need for a re-do. 2. Check back with your customers every couple of minutes. If you can't, send the manager or the hostess. 3. If anyone asks for water, bring water for everyone. 4. If your customers have small children, bring their food first. Make it happen quickly.  Little kids get bored and restless. 5. If the place is super busy, call in your best people and make a fortune.   Chili's, get new management and staff for this location pronto.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westford,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0

First off, when we first walked in their was no hostess. We looked around, no waitress or bartender to be seen so we waited several minutes to be seated. This isn't that bad, but just unusual. The bathrooms were appalling, disgusting in smell and the floor was intensely slippery. There were 4 of us and the waitress completely messed up completely 2 of our orders, after we waited quite a while to get our food. So our quick stop put us at 1 hour 20 minutes.
