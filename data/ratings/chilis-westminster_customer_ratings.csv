38,Rick H.,"Arvada, CO",195,339,102.0,4.0,2013-01-10,"I'm not sure why, just like Soulja Boy and Vanilla Ice, Chili's Bar & Grill gets such a bad rap.  After all, they single-handily brought the Margarita to the forefront of the American Bar scene, back when the Cosmo was all the rage.  Yes, now you remember. 1994 and it all started with ""The Presidente."" The margarita that comes delivered to you in a translucent blue plastic cocktail shaker, which never quite seals itself enough to shake without dripping margarita all over the place. Admit it, you go...and you go with friends, family (and dare I say it) co-workers. There, felt just like therapy, didn't it. Say it with me, ""Yes, I go to Chili's and I like it."" What do I enjoy about Chili's Bar & Grill? It's a chain. (Yes, that five-letter word everyone treats as a four-letter word). And with a chain, you get consistency. You'll enjoy the same staff, the same dishes and consistently great specials.  You see, when I can't decide what I want, where to go or have last week's bad dinning experience still resonating in my mind, I want to go somewhere I know that will be consistent. Chili's is my go to place. Cold beer, fresh margaritas (try the ""Rita Trio"" next time) and great solid recipes, sounds like a solid approach to a fun night out to me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westminster?start=20,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997

They still have the crappy skillet queso that tastes like Hormel Chili and Velveeta. The wings aren't all that good either. The chips and salsa are still pretty good though. Happy Hour is two for one drinks with free chips and salsa.

I had a huge craving for a nice juicy medium-rare steak and I've really enjoyed the crispy onion strings in the past, so I entered the order and drove to pick it up at the designated time 30 minutes later. The onion strings were cold and soggy. The rib-eye did absolutely nothing to satisfy my craving; it had no sear, was brown and dry throughout the inside, very under-seasoned, and measured in at just under half an inch in thickness. I'm still hungry and don't even want to finish this sorry excuse for a steak.

Then we sat down and noticed how many empty tables there were. Some needed to be bussed, but others were clean and ready to be seated. We wondered why they weren't being filled. Anyway, we were taken to a table and it took a little while to be greeted. Both couples ordered an appetizer, but one came out long before the other. Ours came out right before dinner, so we didn't have any time in between. The food was the usual standard for Chilis.

There is another one down closer to where I live that is great, but this one just happens to be close to work. A buddy and I came here for a quick lunch - we even called ahead to make sure they could get us in and out quickly. The waitress seemed completely off in la la land, and wouldn't give us any eye contact, even when we tried to compliment her and joke around. I made a complaint (which I never do) because there was a huge piece of plastic packaging cooked into my fajitas and she just kind of said, ""oh"" and walked off. When she came back around, I asked for the manager, who immediately apologized and took the dish to be remade. He is the only reason this lunch was saved, as he was a very good customer pleaser - pleasant, joked with us, offered apologies, etc. The food was fine once the mishap was cleared up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westminster?start=20,2.412,2.412,2.412,2.412,2.412

21,Taylor G.,"Denver, CO",11,232,8.0,4.0,2015-02-16,"My review will be regarding both my experience with the food and the drink I ordered at the bar. My boyfriend took me here wanting to see what has changed with the place and see what they offer now. We got an order of nachos, with chicken and I was kinda surprised when I could literally count the tortilla chips on the plate, not too bad but definitely skimpy on the sour cream and salsa. I could have done with the cheese being melted a bit more, but generally not too bad. My boyfriend ordered a hamburger with bacon and I got a 3 -part deal with soft taco enchilada with beans and rice. While we were waiting, I decided to check out the bar and grab a drink. I don't remember if it was happy hour but I prefer not to drink well options so I ordered a spicy bloody mary with grey goose. $8.75 . Yikes! I was hoping she would put Worcestershire sauce, tabasco, lots of pepper and green olives . Nope, but what she did do was give me nearly a triple shot of grey goose, I suppose to compensate for the high cost of the thing ...but sometimes too much of something isn't a good thing. Anyways, I went back to my seat and I added lots more tabasco and a lot more pepper.  I noticed she didn't really ""mix "" my drink, she just poured liquor and then put tomato juice on top of it.. ya I remixed it myself when I sat down. I still chugged the thing and got on to dinner. I have to say, I was impressed with how much more flavor their food has. The enchilada chicken was tasty and the ""sour cream sauce"" wasn't anything I was expecting. It was good! My soft taco was great and I even liked the cilantro rice I asked for extra salsa, and although I would consider it mild, adding a little tabasco on it made a difference.. My boyfriend loved his hamburger and ate most of his fries, it was good sized and I was surprised how thick his meat looked . All in all, not bad service , decent food and not bad for what their prices are. Aside from the over-poured drink I had .. I recommend the food , however I think I'll just stick to beer next time I go in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westminster?start=40,2.544,2.544,2.544,2.544,2.544

I know they where short staffed but when we asked for lemons or extra napkins it was like we were being a burden to her.

I always order the same thing: sirloin steak with steamed veggies. Typically there is not a thing left on my plate and the steak is tender and has almost no gristle, but this time the steak was almost all gristle and I ate maybe half. The broccoli is usually steamed soft and with some butter flavor and very yummy. This broccoli was hard (more raw-ish then steamed) and didn't have any taste. I left that too. Sigh, so dissapointed.

39,Ashley B.,"Fernandina Beach, FL",1,18,,2.0,2016-02-15,"To start off- I love Chili's, however, I've had two not so great experiences at this location within the past two months.  First, I called to place a to-go order and was on hold for about 10 minutes before someone actually took my order (not a big deal, it was during the dinner rush). After getting home with the food, I cut my steak that was supposed to be medium well (even had a labeled stick in it that said medium well), to find that this was barely cooked.  I would say it was rare, but it was still purpleish pink inside- YUCK! Fast forward a few weeks, we decide to give it another try but sit inside instead of order to-go.  The waitress asked us if we were ready to order before even being seated, then asked us two more times in the next 10 minutes. I ordered the chicken fajitas (which were great, by the way), and my boyfriend ordered a burger.  Again, the meat was served very rare.  Had he ordered it to be served rare it would not have mattered, but it seems as if the cooks are just rushing the meat to get put on a table.   Overall, service is fine at this location.  Most everything I have eaten here has been pretty good.  I will probably not be ordering burgers or steaks from this location from now on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westminster?start=20,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6

The restaurant was decently clean except the glasses were dirty.  The food on the other hand was terrible. I got a 18$ ribeye with mashed potatoes and broccoli. My mother and brother had the triple dipper which came with 3 apps of your choice. My son got Mac and cheese with a salad. My mother and brother both enjoyed 75% of their food and both said that the cheese bites were too rich and flavorless.  I ordered my steak medium and when it came out it was rare. I had a hard time getting a hold of someone to fix the steak. Finally I got a different server to take it back.  About 10 minutes later, after my brother, mom, and son finished eating, my new steak came out. This time it was well done. I took one bite and couldn't eat it. The broccoli and potatoes were bland even with butter and sour cream. 20$ is too much to pay for that steak.  Our food also took longer than it should have. We finally got everything after about 45 minutes.  The only good thing I ate was southwest egg rolls.  I've been to chili's before and expected good food quickly and didn't get that.

No biggie, I am in the industry and understand things happen! Our server was nowhere to be found so I had to ask the bartender to help us (great guy!). After ordering a new entree (chicken crispers), we waited for 17 minutes for his entree. In that time, I was never offered a refill on my soup (I ordered the unlimited soup and salad) *the first one was room-temp at best*, so we sat there and waited. Seriously, I am a server! When someone is unhappy with their entree, you should make it a top priority to get them something else they will like! Especially something easy from the fryer! Chicken crispers came out as mentioned 17 minutes later with an inch on burned breading all over them and the wrong side. The only thing edible on the plate was the corn on  the cob. My second soup came out cold. Fine, we were ready to be done with this ""meal"" and GTFO. I asked our server for the check, she asked if we wanted a box for the crispers (the plate was practically uneaten), no thank you, just the check... FIFTEEN minutes later, still no check. I paid on the table ziosk, just to get out of there as we were both nauseated by the filthy unchanged oil from the fryer. Seriously, the WORST restaurant experience of my life. Surrounding tables were never bussed, the floors were sticky, and the bathrooms were FILTHY.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westminster?start=20,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
9,Stacey M.,"Golden, CO",8,36,,3.0,2017-02-13,Stopped about 8pm on a Saturday.  Not busy which was a great added bonus!  Our Waiter was super nice and got us everything we needed when asked.  Drinks were good and cold.  Our Queso was not very hot but still yummy!  Our dinners were super good!  Salted Caramel dessert rocked my socks!  The only down side is this....  We paid via the ziosk and it didn't print our receipt.  Our server printed it for us and looked disappointed when he saw his tip.  I am firm believer in tipping the server for their work.  And we did that.  So to look disappointed at a 17% tip really hit me wrong.  We will be back. :),https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westminster,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
4,Casey C.,"Denver, CO",73,385,18.0,5.0,2017-03-26,"Chili's has really upped their game.  Service was spot on, beer menu was on par for Colorado and the food was top notch. I really enjoy their Chili-con-question and the fajita's are legit! That said, I'd skip the chicken but overall a very pleasant dining experience",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westminster,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72

8,Anita H.,"Aurora, CO",27,3,,1.0,2017-06-14,"This is my first review on Yelp.  I was motivated to review because I had my worst experience at a Chili's.  Our family is a Chili's regular but this was the first time at this Chili's in Westminster.  We had a party of 10 for a birthday and we understood that our poor waiter Anthony was slammed so we took that into account our only real issue with him was not clearing our different course plates in a timely manner.  Food appetizers:  We had 2 orders of Queso which came out thick and unappetizing.  This is a staple for us when we go to Chili's and have never had it this way.  Food entrees:  OUR FOOD WAS NOT DELIVERED CLOSE TO BEING TOGETHER. We first had a kids pizza delivered and he seem to like it.  We then had 2 entrees that were delivered 5 minutes and they were not warm.  A few minutes later 2 more entrees were delivered and there wasn't any complaints.  While the rest of us waited to have food delivered we watched as the manger Tiffany carried food to a table we assumed was friends of hers and she sat down with them.  We waited 10 more minutes before getting our waiter attention that the rest of us hadn't got our food yet.  He went straight to the kitchen and delivered our food which you can tell had been sitting under heat lamps for a long time.  My burger was way over cooked but I didn't want to wait to have another cooked.  My daughter's are both waitresses and they brought it to our waiter's attention and he said he would speak to the manager about taking care of it.  After we finished we got our checks and noticed that the burger was still on the bill.  We spoke to Anthony and the manager Tiffany came to the table.  SHE WAS EXTREMELY RUDE TO MY DAUGHTERS.  They spoke to her about how our entrees were dead food and you could tell they had been under the heat lamps for an extended period.  She came back with ""What do you want me to do about it?"".  They explained the waiter had said it would be taken off the bill.  She reluctantly did.  This manager Tiffany as we watched never helped bus a table, deliver food (except her friends), deliver drinks when her staff was slammed.  She never went around the restaurant to speak to tables to ask how their experience were.  She never helped so I believe that is why the rest of the staff did not help run food when they saw food setting under the lamps.  I will NEVER go to this Chili's again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westminster,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
0,Tobie T.,"Denver, CO",0,26,,4.0,2017-07-21,"It took a few years to come back here, this location and pretty much any Chili's seemed to be suffering, the food was just so nasty and bad customer service. We came here to celebrate Father's day, and our waitress was AWESOME! I wish I got her name =( We have a pretty big family, and she was great with everyone, keeping everything on track with the kid's orders. The food has gone through a complete makeover. New items are on the menu, and everyone's food was great! Only complaint is the chicken critters. Whatever batter the use to coat it so gross, not crunchy at all very puffy is the best way to describe it. And the chicken was super mushy, almost like a fish and chips texture.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westminster,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72
3,Tracy S.,"Broomfield, CO",10,3,,1.0,2017-10-01,"I showed up prepared to eat, drink, and work on my laptop. Lots of empty booths. I asked the hostess if I could sit near an electrical outlet. She quickly, and abruptly said they didn't have any outlets. No looking, no attempt to accommodate. End of discussion. Disappointing. Now I'm on my way to have dinner somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westminster,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68

Manager only offered to refund the difference even after we got the wrong order.

1,Kristi R.,"City Center, Aurora, CO",45,3,,2.0,2018-01-06,Went here to have drinks and food. Drinks were good as usual. The food was alright we thought. My friend and I went home and woke up in the morning to texts from each other asking if we felt sick after eating. Both answers were yes. Undercooked chicken was the cause of our food poisoning. We ate chicken strips that are deep fried.  The only reason I give two stars is because the server was awesome! And the manager was fantastic on refunding my money.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-westminster,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
