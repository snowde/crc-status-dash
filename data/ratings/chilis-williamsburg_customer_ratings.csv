17,Rich O.,"Newport News, VA",46,42,,2.0,2014-06-30,"This visit to Chili's started off like any other, we entered and were seated promptly.  From ordering drinks and receiving them to ordering lunch went well.  Then came the wait...  We saw our waitress almost in tears taking food back to the kitchen a few booths from us.  After over an hour of waiting, our food finally arrived.  The food itself was standard Chili's fare, and was fine.  My guess is that the kitchen was having more of their normal issues (we waited a while here for a food a few weeks ago, but nothing like this!), and without us prompting, the Manager came out and apologized and gave us 1/2 off of our meals.  When she brought the bill out, our waitress asked if the Manager had been out to see us, so I'm guessing that she was the one that sent her.  It's very unlikely that we'll now give this Chili's another shot - we'll stick with the one in Newport News.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-williamsburg?start=20,1.9280000000000002,1.9280000000000002,1.9280000000000002,1.9280000000000002,1.9280000000000004

She was a lot of fun to work with and offered great suggestions. My only complaint is the water. Have you ever had clear water that literally tasted like dirt? If that's your thing, then Chili's is your place. Otherwise I would suck it up and pay for a soda. When I told our waitress about the dirt water, she said that it's a problem that all the restaurants have, but I'm a regular at the Applebee's next door and they don't have dirt water, so maybe that's something management should look into.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-williamsburg?start=20,2.192,2.192,2.192,2.192,2.192

It was so slow, my wife ordered unlimited soup and salad and just got one of each. Soup had to go back three times because it was lukewarm.  2. Love that their table top touchscreen of games as trivia does not inform you of the $1.99 charge for using it.  3. I ordered the ribs and shrimp combo. The shrimp were so small and frozen, I can buy better shrimp from Costco. Then they coated it in pepper seasoning to make up for the lack of flavor, and you could no longer taste the shrimp.  4.

Recently, after a day at Bush Gardens with the family, I went to the Chili's in Williamsburg VA and ordered the fish taco's...  The fish in them was rancid, as in rotten.  My girlfriend took a bite of a different taco and confirmed the meat was no good. I returned them and ordered some sliders, I wasn't trying to scam for free food and just wanted a meal.  The chef came out and denied the fish was bad, then he said it was my taste buds and that I didn't like his spice... then he stormed off... All in front of my kids and girlfriend. After that the service was super slow, to non existent... I suspect that the chef had bullied the staff into dismissing us... Before that the manager and waiter had been present and pleasant.  Basically: They served me rotten fish and when I complained the chef blamed me and had his staff treat us like dirt. Nasty experience for sure... Nastier fish tacos...

Waiting time was exceptional, atleast it was'nt like last time where it was an hour long wait. As for my food,it fell below my expectations. The burger was good,but was not a fan of the spiced pickles. (They could've said something about that) I ordered the crispy chicken fingers,first the guy gave me a small 3piece side. I then asked that I wanted the chick,en meal. Then he gave me an plate of fries w/ a smaller 2 piece that was almost inedible. Which usually for 10 dollars, you'll get like 7 big pieces for that price. The salad was ok, but what they had as for Italian dressing was horrible. I ordered a side of broccoli which they forgot about. The waiter was overly happy (into himself) even annoyingly flattered himself. He even mentioned that alot of the food is precooked to be cooked again for later on...Hey,some places may do that but won't mention it,so thanks for mentioning it,but did'nt need to hear it. That's problaby why my chicken was the way it was. .......  When it came down to paying for the food, it took a lot longer and more complicated than it should have been.  The waiter used like 4 or 5 different machines,because they were'nt working. ..... But I give a small thumbs up for the effort. ""My pleasure they say"" Good thing the place was so empty, or the service would've been more of an unfortunate experience. 3 years since the last visit and still a dissapointment,smh.
