3,A B.,"Wilmington, NC",0,16,,2.0,2012-06-28,"The food and service is seriously going downhill there. Our waiters were taking care of a large party which was understandable, but after the party left we didn't see them until the end of our meal. They never asked us if we needed refills (we did) or if we needed anything after our food was brought out (we did). We had to ask the host to get what we needed. My corn on the cob was soggy and gross. After our meal the manager came over and made excuses about the service, saying the party threw the servers off their game, even though they were finished with the party well before our food even came out. We will not be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wilmington-5?start=20,,,,,
2,Mac H.,"Wilmington, NC",10,23,5.0,5.0,2013-10-19,Had old school chicken quesadillas tonight! Awesome service too. Best service I've had in a long time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wilmington-5?start=20,,,,,
23,Ashleigh R.,"Hampstead, NC",2,10,7.0,5.0,2014-09-24,"Chili's has quickly become my new favorite place to eat. Try have great food! My favorite  it the bacon ranch quesadillas! So tasty! Also, their service is always pretty good too. Especially today. My drink never reached the bottom. I always had a new before I even finished the one I was working on!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wilmington-5,,,,,
19,Michael B.,"Raleigh, NC",109,429,947.0,3.0,2014-11-02,"I visited this @Chilis with their @Ziosk for dessert one evening. The server Nicole asked for the drink order, and I specified that I wanted a drink with no ice, because that is my preference. When she brought my drink to the table she mentioned that there was ice in my drink, and I think I did well by keeping my calm. If you, the server, ask me what I want to drink, and you don't bring me exactly what I asked for, then that means that you don't respect me as a customer, and don't care what I want. If you knew that is not what I wanted, then you should not have served it to me, plain and simple.   I asked the server about the desserts, and she was able to describe them accurately.  The dessert I ordered was surprisingly good. It was made nice and hot, and the ice cream was served cold on top, and not brought out half melted from the warm brownie.    When it came time to pay for the check, the bill was set on the table, and then I placed my credit card on tray for the server, or her partner to cash me out. After a couple of minutes I think it was the servers partner came by and saw my card on the table, and this was the following conversation: Server: Do you know you can pay from the Ziosk? Me: Yes, I am aware of that. Server: Oh, so you just want me to cash you out? (Seemed like there was a bit of an attitude in the tone.) Me: Yes, I do. This is how I feel about the Ziosk, I hate them. Yes, I do own my own tablet, but I shouldn't be forced or made to feel obligated to use them. And this are my reasons why. 1) I went to a FULL-SERVICE restaurant. That means I am paying for somebody to wait on me, take my drink order, clear the table, refill my drink, bring my food to the table, cash me out, etc. If I didn't want full service, I could have spent less money by going to McDonalds, or stopping at the store, or going somewhere else. 2) The server expects T.I.P.S. based on what I order. If you want me to place my order on the Ziosk, pay for everything on the Ziosk, ask for a refill on the Ziosk, why am I tipping you, when you didn't do anything? The machine doesn't get the tip when it did all the work. If I am expected to leave a tip for the server, then I expect the server to do their job and work for it. I expect the same at every full-service restaurant, and I am not going to make you jump through hoops.  Just the standard service, not less-than standard. T.I.P.S. = To Insure Prompt Service. Notice the P stands for prompt, not pathetic. 3) When I use my phone, tablet, or computer, or even their touch screen system to order at any other restaurant, they don't expect me to leave a tip, so why does Chili's? You removed a level of service, yet still expect me to pay based on a higher standard of service. 4) Because of the Ziosk, the servers do not come around as much to check on the customers. They expect the customers to wait on themselves via the Ziosk. Since I went to a restaurant for the full-service dining experience, come check on me to see if I need anything. I am not at McDonalds. Anyway, that is just what I think. #318",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wilmington-5,,,,,
24,Kristin S.,"Wilmington, NC",75,39,3.0,3.0,2015-01-07,"Hmmm. I have been here countless times and on many many many occasions. I have had GREAT service many times and then HORRIBLE serve many times over the years. The food is always great, never any compliants about the food or quality. Its always either you wait forever to get the food or the service is cold or they forget about you. But then you go and its amazing all around. So it really just depends, I love the lunch specials during the week, awesome price for a good amount of food. My favorites are the fagittas, bacon ranch quesidillas, and the original chicken crispers and the magrittas are awesome as well. Hope this helps.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wilmington-5,,,,,
18,Emily T.,"Wilmington, NC",110,91,760.0,5.0,2015-03-30,"I been here numerous of times and a place that me and my friends go to a lot when we need to catch up. The food is fast and the service is always top notch. Atmosphere is fun can get a little loud but nothing where you can t hear the other person. They have great lunch specials and their chips and salsa is to die for. We get refills all the time. Also try their mango tea, it's delicious! I had the bacon chicken ranch quesadilla and its sooo good! Next time I go im getting them again for a 99 cent upgrade I got rice and beans with my 2 for 20 deal. The rice is sooo good and I'm Asian so I know when rice is good haha. They have a variety of stuff on their 2 for 20 like steak, fajitas, pasta, chicken tenders, quesadilla, and other things. The deal comes with a app also. If you wanted a alcohol drink I think it's a 35 dollar special both get drink, app, and entree. So it's not a bad deal. Give this place a try, it wouldn't hurt.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wilmington-5,,,,,
0,Andres M.,"Jacksonville, NC",0,12,,1.0,2015-07-25,"Pretty bad food, by Chili's standards. I used to qualify Chili's as a step above Applebee's, but now I'm not so sure. The service here is fine, the place is pretty old, and the food is blah. The food is not terrible, it's just bad for the price. Unless you're coming in for drinks, stay away from this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wilmington-5?start=20,,,,,
22,Sam B.,"Wilmington, NC",0,2,,3.0,2015-07-30,The food and service was satisfactory however was taken aback by their delivery of an unsolicited birthday dessert and the staff singing a short Happy Birthday day song to my wife.  The REAL surprise though was the Table Entertainment fee of .99 that was added to our check.  Quite tacky and amateurish from a business perspective!!  On the other hand they must not think much of their performances to only charge a buck.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wilmington-5,,,,,
17,Heather W.,"Wilmington, NC",61,91,55.0,5.0,2015-08-22,"Went here for dinner and it was packed at the front door but we got a table within a minute or two of walking in. The food was excellent and our waiter did a excellent job of keeping our glass full and food timing was perfect, we weren't waiting too long. I've only had one experience where the food didn't come out right and they gave me my whole meal for free, it was great service recovery and they didn't lose me as a customer!! My food always comes out right now and cooked and plated well! I don't think I've had a bad meal here yet! Even though it's a chain restaurant they step their game up at this location! Highly recommend!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wilmington-5,,,,,
13,Jamie M.,"Huntersville, NC",5,148,44.0,5.0,2015-09-09,Very good food. Always love the egg rolls & boneless buffalo wings as an appetizer. Love the blackberry tea! The honey chipotle chicken crispers are great!! Had a good waitress too.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wilmington-5,,,,,
20,Lauren P.,"Stanley, NC",114,92,36.0,3.0,2015-12-24,"The food, was okay. Better than what I remember for a Chili's. The drinks were great (whoever was bartending was a little heavy handed (: ). However the service was a lacking quite a bit. I understand that it was a holiday, but it was like she took our order and deserted us. Saw her once the food was dropped off then gone again. All in all not a bad experience. I'm always more focused on the food vs service anyways.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wilmington-5,,,,,
21,Robert S.,"Washington, DC",0,7,,1.0,2016-08-13,I went there because I had a gift card. It was a mistake. The management comped my meal. Which I could no longer eat. I gave the gift card to a family member in another state. I will never return,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wilmington-5,,,,,
16,Shanda H.,"ELMENDORF AFB, AK",0,9,1.0,2.0,2016-09-06,"Well, heck. You can't go wrong with Chilis can you? Wrong. We walked in and got seated quickly. We waited ten minutes before we got drinks. The service was terrible. There was one waitress who was talking to her friend all night and ignoring customers, and our waitress seemed as though she forgot about us completely. If we needed something we had to physically get up and go ask if we could have a refill, another ranch, the check, and for the boxes. The food also seemed subpar from other Chilis I have tried. It was not cooked properly, we had cheese fries and the cheese was cooked for so long it was hard and sticking to the pan. This is one of the worst experiences I have ever had at Chilis. Disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wilmington-5,,,,,
14,Louise T.,"Vista, CA",12,8,,1.0,2016-10-23,". This was the worst place to eat as I had to send back my order 3 times and by the last time the other people in my party had already finished. The manager came, apologized and did nothing. I would not eat there if it were the only place to eat. Such stupidity and the manager doing nothing. I hate the place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wilmington-5,,,,,
6,Morgan M.,"Wilmington, NC",7,56,27.0,1.0,2016-12-08,"Chili's used to be one of my favorite restaurants and sadly I will no longer patron the place. Hopefully this is just a NC issue, but I haven't had decent service or a correct order in years. The service is consistently poor, the server's attitudes are poor, the orders are seldom correct, and the food quality and preparation is poor. I have procrastinated on this review because I worked at Chili's in Greenville while attending university and it was a wonderful experience and I feel like I am being disloyal. However, enough is enough. I order the triple dipper every time I get food from them. I have one simple request, please give me honey mustard in lieu or the usual sauces that come with it (I loath ranch). Never, not once, have they given me honey mustard. I get the orders to go because service is bad and the restaurant is not the cleanest (I know, but I used LOVE their food and my immune system is pretty strong). I don't think it is a complicated request but one that goes unfulfilled time and time again. They have a very unique honey mustard so any other type of honey mustard completely changes the flavor dynamic. A few months ago we ordered the Cajun Chicken pasta and the left the seasoning off which turns it into a different dish altogether (chicken alfredo).  At the beginning of the year we picked up dessert and the Molten Chocolate Cake was frozen solid, ironically the ice cream that goes with it was melted by the time we got it home so I'm guessing it was also sitting out for a while. Last year we ate there and one of the servers ripped my husband's credit card information and proceeded to go on a shopping spree. Police confirmed it was one of their servers as they did this to others. Regarding the poor service, it takes forever to get anything. It is usually a ten minute wait for a drink order and I recommend drinking it slow as you may not get the opportunity to get another one as someone other than your server drops the food off and usually the server will come back in 45 minutes to drop off the check. The servers tend to stand by the kitchen and talk so it's not like they are busy. It's not uncommon for your food to begin to get cold if you need something immediately after your food is delivered because your server is MIA. I also recommend paying in cash as waiting to get your card back could add an extra 30 minutes to your stay. With respect to sanitation, the tables are greasy, the menus are sticky, and they frequently give babies frackers which end up everywhere but do not get cleaned up so they are frequently under the tables and in the booths. I blame myself for these bad experiences as I always break down and go back when I am feeling nostalgic. I would also like to state that I am not a picky eater or somebody that is rude to food service employees, and worked in the industry to get through school so I understand how difficult this job is or how sometimes stuff happens. My criticisms are consistent and I have patroned the Chilis on College Rd off and on for four years and just think that it's poor management as reflected by the employees blatant disinterest in performing their jobs. I am posting a photo of my latest disappointment from this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wilmington-5,,,,,
12,Polly F.,"Rocky Point, NC",28,5,2.0,1.0,2016-12-30,Been here since 5:15 and no food. Slow to seat and waited 20 minutes for drinks. Really? This is not good service or professional serving. My five year old grandson is starving.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wilmington-5,,,,,
10,Jessica R.,"Castle Hayne, NC",32,83,9.0,2.0,2017-01-05,I always enjoy the food every time I go. They have a nice bar area. The mix drinks are to die for. They are really pack mostly on the weekend like Saturday & Sunday . Could be long of a wait .,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wilmington-5,,,,,
15,Christa D.,"Wilmington, NC",0,3,,5.0,2017-04-14,"I can say that Chili's is a fantastic restaurant. Everyone is very nice and very friendly, and always makes sure that you are doing okay. I am a regular, going to eat there at least once a week. Although they do get busy on the weekends (as does every restaurant) and the servers don't get as much time as they would like to spend with you, they do tend to make every moment at your table as helpful as they can. Their host team is very welcoming and always helps the customers and the servers throughout the night. And the managers are definitely some great and hilarious people! Also, the food always comes out delicious! My favorite things to order are the Big Mouth Bites, Fried Pickles, and the Oreo Molten Lava Cake. Yum!  I have seen some of the negative reviews on here and I just know that most of these people probably go to Chili's during the busiest times on the weekend, where you should expect that the service is going to be a little slower and you won't have much face to face time with your server because they are busy running around working. People should really think about that before writing a bad review. Anyways, I love Chili's! You guys keep doing what you do!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wilmington-5,,,,,
11,Santiago L.,"SC, SC",119,10,,5.0,2017-04-19,"My girlfriend and I love this place more than Cookie Monster loves cookies.  The steaks here are really nice.  My girlfriend gets the bacon ranch quesadillas quite often, and she seems to enjoy them a lot.

7,Drew B.,"Wilmington, NC",112,20,2.0,2.0,2017-07-29,"I have always enjoyed chilis but I went in today with someone to enjoy some lunch and had a rather annoying experience. It was not very busy but we were sat right next to the open kitchen walk way. During our lunch, we heard screaming and yelling from the kitchen that made my experience unpleasant. I work in the industry so I know that sometimes it gets loud in the kitchen. But when I see servers leaning around and kitchen staff messing around screaming and yelling, it makes me not want to come back. Luckily our server was good or else I may have walked out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wilmington-5,,,,,
9,Jackson R.,"Wilmington, NC",0,4,,5.0,2017-08-21,"Best place in Wilmington service is amazing and fast, food is delicious. If you can definitely splurge get an appetizer, meal, and desert. Everything is great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wilmington-5,,,,,
8,Kayla T.,"Boone, NC",2,6,,1.0,2017-08-29,Worst service ever. The ladies are old and don't respect younger people at all. Little did she know all three of us are servers and would have tipped 50% if the service was better. Personally I've been serving for 7 years and have never once argued with customer like she just did. Super disappointed,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wilmington-5,,,,,
5,Mickey A.,"Wilmington, NC",124,83,86.0,3.0,2017-09-16,"I've been to Chili's many times, but this experience was something else. Myself & three girlfriends went for dinner because two of us had coupons on the app for free queso and a free dessert. All of our meals were really good, however it was at the end of the meal where we encountered some issues. Our waiters (we had two for some reason) failed to explain to us how the ""Ziosk"" worked, which was a screen at the table at which you can split checks and pay there. Eventually we tried to use it, but it froze up and we couldn't tell if the first card went through or not. We flagged one of our waiters down and he finally explained that the whole system was down and no one has been able to pay. He brought our paper checks after another wait without taking off our free items, so he said there wasn't anything we could do with the checks and it would be ""another minute or two."" We were there literally over an hour after we had finished our food simply waiting to pay. I understand having technical difficulties, but there is no excuse for the poor service we received during this time. Our waiters did not give us an apology and pretty much treated the situation like a joke. I also had to ask the waiter four separate times for a new ice cream for my to-go dessert since it melted during the wait. I asked to speak to the manager before we left, and thankfully she did apologize and give us each some gift cards as compensation. I was disappointed with the way an already unfortunate situation was handled by our waiters, since it is obviously unacceptable to have to wait that long just to pay and get out. At least the meal was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wilmington-5,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004
