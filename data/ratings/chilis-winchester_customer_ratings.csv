27,Mario O.,"Bunker Hill, WV",78,63,10.0,1.0,2013-08-05,"(I hadn't been here in over 3 years) Let's start at the beginning...there are 2 bartenders behind the bar when I arrive & 2 other guests sitting at the bar. After 6 minutes, I'm finally greeted. Five minutes later I'm finally served my beer. At the 15 minute mark I'm finally brought a menu. I order a few minutes later. After another 25 minutes the bartender comes back around to see if I need another beer (I'd placed the empty one on the bar mat 10 minutes ago). I tell him I'd like another. He then says ""She'll take your order."" I assumed he was talking to someone else since I'd placed my order 25 minutes ago. He then repeats himself motioning behind me. There's a waitress standing there. I turn back to him & say ""I've already ordered."" Then in a defensive tone he says ""No, you haven't!"" After looking at him like he's the dumbest person I've ever seen, I say ""Yes. I have. You asked me what I'd like and I said 'A half rack of...""  He cuts me off ""dry rub with fries. My bad, I forgot to ring it in."" The waitress can tell I'm pissed & offers me some chips & salsa while I wait. I decline. I sit there for about 5 more minutes. I STILL haven't received my 2nd beer. At this point I look at my watch and realize I've been here 50 minutes, have only received one beer and no food. I decide to walk out (on the bar tab, too) and never come back.

16,Jared C.,"Harmony, PA",10,4,1.0,1.0,2014-07-04,. I ordered a ribeye and debated whether it was beef or pork the entire time I ate it. I suppose chilis could warrant a better rating due to the fact I finished my entire meal but really a slab of mystery meat is debatable. I won't be going to another chilis again. I could understand if the steak was 4.95 but 18 bucks for a hunk of mystery meat is questionable. Sorry chilis. Up your game.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-winchester,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116

I don't know if they have new management or just hire people these days that don't give a rats ar se, but today was the second time in the past couple of months that we were seated.............and forgotten. After 10 minutes, had to go to the kitchen and ask if there were any waitresses working there. Finally, they were gracious enough to send a waiterss to our table. Drinks took forever to come, food took longer and was medicore at best. Had to ask for a refilll. Tried to order a lava cake via the table station, only to have it say the check had already been split and I had to order via waitress. So I went to find her again.

17,Kirsten B.,"Purcellville, VA",299,46,,3.0,2014-12-21,******3.5 stars******** My first time in a Chilis in years. The service was fast and friendly even though she had many tables. I got a blackberry margarita which was good. Like most places these days you couldn't taste any alcohol. I had three soft tacos that were good but had a kick from the green chilies. Made the mistake of sharing the first bite with my toddler and promptly had to order a glass of milk to soothe her burning taste buds. I also had a side salad that was good - didn't taste like it came out of a bag like most places. The balsamic citrus dressing was pretty good. Only complaint about the salad is the bowl was very small and made it hard to toss.  My husband and daughter got the sliders. They said they tasted alright but the buns were burnt so it kind of ruined the burgers.  Overall I was pleasantly surprised not having been to a chilies in several years. We are not Winchester locals but would consider eating at another location if we come across one while traveling or something.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-winchester,,,,,
20,Cameron C.,"Winchester, VA",22,15,7.0,3.0,2014-12-22,"There's nothing super special about the Chili's here in Winc, its like any other Chili's anywhere else. That's not always a bad thing, because its not a bad chain. I do have to say though that the service at this one has gone down hill over the years. I used to always have good experiences with waiters/hosts but now it's very hit or miss.  Our waiter was a bit off, I'm not sure if he was having a bad day but his service just wasn't very friendly, he never smiled, he seemed to be forgetting quite a bit as well. It could be just his type of personality or like I said maybe his day wasn't going well but it wasn't a good service experience.  The food was pretty standard. My friend got the fried pickles and they were barely fried. It was more like warm pickles with flakes of crust from the fryer sprinkled over. I must say though that my potato soup was pretty delicious but I mean you can never go wrong with cheese and bacon, right? Overall I'd say this place is just okay. Service isn't great, food isn't slap your mom amazing, and at the end of the day its just a Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-winchester?start=20,,,,,

14,Samantha D.,"Smithfield, VA",0,26,8.0,5.0,2016-03-17,"Not sure how other people had such bad experiences... I'm sitting at the table for my second experience at this location. The first was SO incredible, I figured it must have been a fluke. But to my delight, the Sante Fe chicken salad is just as scrumptious as the first time! (It's my favorite dish here.) Having eaten at Chili's all over the U.S., I can boldly say that THIS location makes the best Sante Fe! I had let the server who seated me know that I was in a hurry and, by the time my booty hit the seat, another server was there, ready to take my order! I had almost just stopped for fast food, because of my hurry... but I really wanted a good salad. SO happy I came here! Even with as much of as hurry as I am in to get home and meet a serviceman, I'm taking the time to type this as I eat. That's how impressed I am!:-) The last time, I was here with my husband. Harrison was our server... and he was INCREDIBLE. Today, Angel is my server... and she really IS an angel! Such amazing service!

13,Rod W.,"Ashburn, VA",14,23,1.0,1.0,2016-04-28,"This is the second time I've eaten here in the past month, but the third time I visited.  The first time was just okay. Nothing to write home about. Not bad, just not that great either. This was at lunchtime and I had my go to salad, Boneless Buffalo Chicken. A little too heavy on the dressing, but okay.  The second time I ended up walking out (lunchtime again 11:30-11:40). Several employees walked by and never acknowledged I was even there. Waited about 10 minutes and no one showed up to seat me.  Tonight was the last chance and they blew it-big time. Seated pretty quickly, drink order taken fairly quickly and food order went in timely also. Again, went with my go to salad, Boneless Buffalo Chicken.  There was sooo much dressing, it was inedible, the lettuce was limp and lifeless and the only thing I could taste was the deessing. It was disgusting. The chicken was overly salty and didn't have much buffalo sauce. The waitress's family came in shortly before our food arrived and sat at the table next to us. She spent all her time with them and never came back to our table except to drop off the check. The manager was too preoccupied busing tables to be concerned with how the restaurant was running.  So long Chili's. No way I'd go back.  Yelp needs to have a way to enter 0 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-winchester,,,,,

11,Emily G.,"Winchester, VA",2,17,7.0,1.0,2016-08-25,"Felt as if we were a nuisance to the servers. We had no special requests except for an extra plate for my daughter. Had to ask for napkins and refills and boxes.. Otherwise would have gone unnoticed. They were not busy. When we arrived, we were literally the only table in the restaurant. Some 1 top bar stragglers came in during our visit but that was it. Food presentation looked like slop on a plate. Fries were at least 30 minutes old.

We had our dog with us so we were limited to food options.  Glad we were able to sit outside in the patio area near the takeout entrance and parking lot. Not great views but hey they accommodated our pooch. It was a much better option than  getting container takeout and eating in the hotel room. We enjoyed a few drinks & bottomless tortilla chips with salsa while they prepared our meal. The bbq ribs with dr. Pepper sweet sauce was surprisingly good, I could have skipped the seared shrimp add on, too salty and lacked taste. The tito's punch was super good, I had three!! Pleasantly surprised with the Chili's chain, much better experience then Applebee's or Fridays. WTG chili's I love good customer service!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-winchester,,,,,
9,Angela M.,"Baker, WV",0,3,,2.0,2016-10-07,"We were loyal customers, eating 3 to 4 times a week. Servers and some management members knew us as well. Servers who knew us, and serving other tables would stop by to chat for a moment or two. We were always warmly welcomed. It seemed over time service and the quality of food started to wane. It came to a head when steaks ordered well done were served burnt, desserts we loved and ate two days earlier were no longer available/removed from the menu (we understand menus change/updated), ingredients to foods not available, shortage of servers, common alcoholic drinks not available. Our favorite ""watering hole"", has now become our previous one. We are now we looking for a restaurant we can call home. Yelp reviews will definitely be a tool we will be using.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-winchester,,,,,
15,Chelsi D.,"Winchester, VA",13,16,14.0,2.0,2016-10-23,"I once loved this place.  I don't know if it's under new management or what but I don't believe I'll be back any time soon. Waitress was very friendly, but seemed almost timid. She looked young so she's probably fairly new. She was nice though and this poor review has nothing to do with her or anything she did. We sat there for 10 minutes before our drink order was even taken. By time our waitress asked us what drinks we wanted we had already looked at the menu and were ready to order our meals as well as our drinks. I normally get coke with cherry grenadine in it and I was told they can not do this anymore which is bizarre because I can think of several alcoholic drinks that contain grenadine. Apparently they don't hand out crayons and kids menus anymore which is a bummer because I have a 2 year old who we intended on being able to color to stay occupied. My father has loved the fajitas since I was a small child (I am almost 30). Today he was so disappointed. No loud sizzling steaming fajitas, they were quiet and not steamy. Hot sauce wasn't offered and we weren't checked on again until after our meal so he ate them pretty dry and boring. My brother's meal was an appetizer meal I believe it came with 3 appetizers. Other than cold fries there wasn't anything wrong with his meal. He did however have an empty glass the whole meal because no one bothered to see if we needed refills or napkins. We had no napkins throughout the whole meal. I had the smokehouse burger and I asked for it ""very very well done"" and it had some pink in the middle. Luckily not too much pink, I was still able to eat it. I thought the menu said it had barbecue sauce or some type of sauce on it but it didn't. I could've possibly misread it though, not 100% sure on that one. As I already stated, we weren't checked on until after our meal and right by us they were putting 3 or 4 tables together preparing for a big crowd. I felt they were more worried about the large crowd that wasn't even there yet instead of worrying about those of us who were right there. They put several stacks of napkins on the tables for the large group so my father had to go take some of the napkins off for us. We asked for refills and a to-go box and the waitress said she would be back with those. She had also told us that there would be a survey and they are struggling for 5's and asked us to give a 5. Excuse me, doesn't that defeat the purpose of a survey? Surveys are a way of critiquing a business to see what areas they need improvement in. We paid on the little screen at the table and after about 5 more minutes of no box or refills we left and did not do the survey at all. We were all highly disappointed so the more we talked about our experience on the way home I decided I would write a Yelp review. My intentions aren't to completely bash the place which is why I gave 2 stars instead of 1. I just hope this brings attention to some things so that no one else has the experience we did.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-winchester,,,,,
10,Peter G.,"Northampton, MA",0,3,6.0,1.0,2016-10-28,"Very strange experience at this Chili's. We sat at the bar and the bartender took our drink order and served the drinks fairly quickly and asked to give her a few minutes because she had to run a delivery order to a local hotel! WWWhat? That's the most bazaar thing I've ever heard in my life..., a bartender making deliveries to the neighborhood! And no one stepped in to back her up at the bar. OK, so I noticed my wife's dry martini had a rusty tinge to it. Obviously she made it with sweet vermouth. OK mistakes happen. When she returned she made another and I asked if she had used dry vermouth and she said she had. I watched her make the other and she poured 2 ounces of sweet vermouth (should be 1 part verm, less for a dry, to 6 parts vodka). She admitted she had never made a dry martini before. How is this possible. Zero training to be a bartender?! OK pet peeve..., martini's are stirred, not shaken unless of course you are James Bond! Also, the chicken quesadilla's were dry, poor quality, poorly presented and something I would have expected from a fast food joint for half the price. I normally like Chili's but they've either gone way down hill or at least this one has. I suspect it's very poorly managed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-winchester,,,,,

1,Zac G.,"Greensboro, NC",92,237,148.0,3.0,2017-03-10,"Every Chili's I've been to has benefitted from an attentive, team-based service model, and this one was no exception. Food and drink orders were accurate, wait times were minimal, and our servers were polite and friendly. The food proved to be adequate: tasty but not outstanding. My wife went with a lunch combo of bacon ranch chicken quesadillas and enchilada soup. The quesadillas, a favorite, did not disappoint, and the soup was satisfying albeit a bit one-note (that note being cheesy). I opted for a guacamole burger. The meat had a nice char, and it was plenty flavorful. It was, however, quite greasy and a bit of a chore to eat. Fast casual chains can be risky propositions, but this Chili's seemed to have had its act together and provided us with a satisfying lunch.

8,Greg J.,"Charlotte, NC",7,10,1.0,3.0,2017-04-17,"We ordered again from this Chili's as we stayed in a hotel right next door.  This is the third time we've ordered and they messed up our order for the 2nd time in those three trips.  This time was a little crazy since our entire order was wrong.  Once we got back to the hotel with our food, my son was not very happy.  When I went back and complained the manager was nice enough to comp our entire meal.  I thought that was extreme and wasn't expecting that.  I am happy they gave us our dinner for free, but I think the take-out process needs to be corrected.  Making sure people's orders are correct should be a priority.  I am not sure after trying the place three times that they are on the ball when it comes to confirming orders are correctly bagged.  They did say they were busy, but all restaurants are on a Saturday night.  If you need more bodies, get them in there to make sure your service is great.  If you do take out, make sure they double check your order.  If our most recent bill wasn't given to us for free, I'm sorry I'd have to give this place 1 star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-winchester,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36
