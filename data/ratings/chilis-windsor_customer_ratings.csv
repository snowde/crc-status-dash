24,Bryan R.,"Hartford, CT",102,588,542.0,3.0,2012-02-19,"This place isn't great but it isn't for lack of trying. I think with every Chili's you need to take it with a grain a salt.  The service staff is friendly but the service is pretty slow.  Both times I have gone here the food is probably the worst part, the bathrooms are seemingly never cleaned.  The bar area is usually fairly dead compared to most bars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-windsor?start=20,2.476,2.476,2.476,2.476,2.476
25,Jeanne R.,"Spring Hill, FL",18,163,1.0,4.0,2012-04-29,"The food at this Chili's is consistently good, this location is a bit quieter than the one in Manchester.  We've been here for lunch and had burgers more than once.  I can't seem to order anything but the Monterrey chicken for dinner.  It's so good it's the only thing I get here, time and time again.  Broccoli is steamed fresh.  No need for an appetizer, they give you enough for your entree.  My boyfriend enjoys the 6 oz. steak on most visits, they cook it right every time, which puts a smile on both our faces.  The server stands there while he checks his steak to make sure it's perfect.  Great service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-windsor?start=20,2.512,2.512,2.512,2.512,2.5120000000000005

19,Jeannette B.,"Sarasota, FL",74,46,4.0,4.0,2012-09-26,"Meh,. its Chilis and its near my house.  I always get great service at the bar and in the dining area. The Chillis is way less crowded than the one in Machester or Westfarms. I have never had to wait for a table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-windsor,,,,,
21,Tom I.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",148,1294,2012.0,4.0,2012-09-27,"Food was okay (had friend chicken), but can't beat 2 for $20, that's awesome deal.  Service was fast and was impressed.

22,Nicole S.,"East Granby, CT",0,8,,3.0,2013-03-23,"This was my first time to a Chilis and my first time ever sending food back! My entree was cold in the middle with unmelted cheese and frozen vegetables on top. The staff was very apologetic and even brought me a salad and comped my meal. Probably won't go back, but they turned a bad situation into a better one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-windsor?start=20,,,,,
5,Dan R.,"Simsbury, CT",1547,2070,30621.0,3.0,2013-07-03,"It's July 3rd and our company cafeteria is closed all week. So what are we to do for lunch? Well a bunch of us went here today. No wait at all, a nice bright interior (there was a lot of sunlight in from the glass storefront), so the dining room seemed a lot cheerier than the Chili's in Avon I'm more familiar with.  Our server was upbeat and friendly. She was quick with the chips and drink refills. I had a Santa Fe salad with some minor changes on dressings and no tortilla strips - and the dish was prepared exactly the way I asked for it. Nice broiled chicken, fresh greens and pico, excellent salsa on top. So what was the verdict? Well, we had quick service, a tasty meal, six separate checks calculated without an eye roll or any attitude. Everythiing was good. A solid ""A-OK"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-windsor,,,,,
23,Missy S.,"Port Orange, FL",15,19,,5.0,2013-07-31,Went there with a friend and her teenager.  Had the buffalo chicken sandwich. Its about the best sandwich ive had in years.

10,Chris K.,"Manchester, CT",2,21,41.0,4.0,2014-05-31,"I'm a somewhat regular to this Chili's. Today I decided to get the Memphis Dry Rub half rack of ribs. I appreciated that I could sub broccoli for the home fries.  The ribs came out very quickly, and I wish there was smell-o-vision for Yelp, because my mouth started watering at the wonderful smokey smell coming from the plate. The BBQ sauce was served in a cup on the side, which let me choose between just the dry rub or complementing it by dipping the rib in the cup. Both methods were delicious, but if I had to choose, it would be sans sauce.  I look forward to coming back here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-windsor,,,,,

18,Carlos G.,"Worcester, MA",0,2,,1.0,2014-10-22,Poor service. 8 open tables with a 15 minute wait. Claimed they don't want to overload the kitchen...Emotionally??

20,Leon G.,"East Granby, CT",17,1,,1.0,2015-01-04,"Me and my family would go to this Chili's about once a month or twice, and we always  had a great time, and great food. We haven't been there in a while, and we decided to go this weekend for my birthday. The  service was good at the beginning, until we got our food. I got the sweet and smokey burger, and it was good, but my mother ordered a guacamole burger, and she asked for turkey instead of a beef pattie, but instead, she got a beef pattie. My mother specifically asked the waitress for a turkey pattie first, but the waitress said that she was never told that. They took it back and made a new one with a turkey pattie, but when it came to our table it was terrible. The pattie was cold, and looked like it wasn't even grilled, because there were no grill marks. The onions inside of the burger were supposed to be grilled, but they looked raw. She took one bite and had to spit it out, so she asked the waitress to take it back. When we looked at the digital receipt/check on the new tablet gadget, they charged her for two of the same burgers, but she wasn't even able to eat any of them. But then the manager came to our table and apologized and told us that he would not charge us for her two burgers, so that was good.  I am giving this review one star because the waitress did not get one of the orders correct, and because of how badly the second guacamole burger was prepared. The waitress definetly was nice, and did what she had to do in order to fix the problem, and the manager also helped us by not charging us for the two burgers, but because the order was messed up in the beginning, we had to wait an additional 10 minutes for the second burger. This mess up ruined the night for our family, because we expected better service. The restaurant was half full, so they should have been able to give us better service. We certainly will never go to this establishment again because our past experiences seem to have been getting worse and worse after each visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-windsor?start=20,,,,,
11,Erin C.,"Halethorpe, MD",9,23,26.0,3.0,2015-05-20,"Standard Chili's food, okay service, but sticky tables. If you're here on travel it is a good place to go if you want to know what to expect.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-windsor,,,,,
15,Jay D.,"Blandford, MA",5,20,,1.0,2015-06-16,So I went back here and gave it another try. Ordered the bottomless soup and salad again. Once again it took 40 minutes to get a soup and salad. Stay away if you only have an hour,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-windsor,,,,,

13,Alicia H.,"Windsor Locks, CT",30,15,,4.0,2015-08-05,Nice place to grab a quick bight on the weekend. Love the atmosphere and customer service we receive here.

12,Nicole R.,"San Marcos, TX",132,26,5.0,1.0,2015-09-13,So I decided to place an order togo and my whole order was wrong. Asked for no tomatoes on my side salad and got tomatoes. Asked for a larger diet coke and got regular coke. Then I asked for the margarita grilled chicken and got no black beans rice or chicken. Just broccoli. So I suggest never get this Chili's Togo. You'll get nothing you asked for.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-windsor,,,,,
6,Kevin H.,"Central Manchester, CT",234,76,,4.0,2015-09-16,"Type of order: Several times, lunch, dinner, and late night. Food Quality: Good. Always solid delivery of food each time I have visited.  Beer Selection: Total joke (4-8 draft lines, only macro beers). Only real knock, but it's not the venue's fault. Usually beers selected by corporate.  Service: Always professional, and courteous.  Atmosphere: Chain restaurant. Clean to the naked eye, no signs of general disrepair.  Entertainment: TVs and overhead music only.  Overall Experience: Nice to good experience. Quality Chili's, run efficiently. Recommend Rating: Will be back, suggested for late night munchies.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-windsor,,,,,
17,Family Dinner B.,"Windsor Locks, CT",0,6,,2.0,2016-04-11,Our food was good but the service was sub par. There was four of us at 530. Our server never came over to refill our waters and we had to get her to refill drinks. Once someone brought out our food she never came back over. She was sat with three other tables while we were there and one of them was complaining about sitting there with no service for about 5 minutes. We had to flag down the manager when we needed anything. We used the ziosk to order dessert and then she gave us an attitude about paying and had to wait another 10 minutes to pay. Horrible experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-windsor,,,,,
16,Briana R.,"Southwick, MA",91,2,,2.0,2016-04-29,"Our waitress was great. Once she finally got to us. We sat at a booth in the bar and was told someone would be right with us not once, not twice, but three times. By the time our waitress came over we were ready to order our meals along with our drinks. Our waitress was not horrible what so ever, she was actually very pleasant and attentive when she could get there. But seeing as how our drinks took over 20 minutes to get to our table I'm thinking they were a little short staffed with the crowd that had tonight.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-windsor,,,,,
14,Katie S.,"Simsbury, CT",0,1,,1.0,2016-05-17,"Would never go back. Tuesday night after 8pm- not busy- took 15 minutes to get a drink, left off sides to meal, waited over 10 minutes for water- asked twice. Waitress barely came; waited for napkins, check charged for 2 beers not one- had to keep asking other waitress to get ours. Heard lots of sorries, but that did not make up for bad service & overcooked food. Everything off tonight.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-windsor,,,,,
1,Emmanuel G.,"Bristol, CT",0,4,1.0,2.0,2016-11-05,"Problems with my dining experience here: -17 minute wait after ordering just to get water and then 5 minutes for our drinks from the bar. -Spilt drink, though it was unintentionally done by a waiter, did not get wiped up on the table or the floor. -Families and couples got served before us despite coming in up to 10 and 15 minutes after us. -Food took longer than everyone who ordered after us. The food and drink were good, but the service made the whole experience disappointing.  It is far more welcoming and cleaner than Southington, and the staff is better but to be kept waiting....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-windsor,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
3,Ashley N.,"Windsor, CT",77,5,1.0,1.0,2017-04-23,"If I could give this place no stars, I would. Eating in the restaurant is okay.  Ordering their to-go is ridiculous. This is my second attempt and both to go orders were bad. For the first to go order one of the items I ordered wasn't available, instead of calling me to let me know I showed up at the restaurant at for them to tell me they hadn't started my food because what I ordered was out of stock. They had my number. The tonight I ordered beans and rice with my fajitas, which I didn't receive. I also ordered extra tortillas which I didn't get and the ones that came with my meal were torn. Finally the honey chipotle chicken crispers were provided plain with no honey chipotle in sight. What the fuck? How do you fuck up on so many levels?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-windsor,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72

2,Adam L.,"South Yarmouth, MA",0,11,,1.0,2017-09-22,"The worst service we have ever had. Slow to seat you for dinning in, but they were busy so we understood. Perfection cant be rushed at any cost. At this point everything else went down hill. We were placed at a table the same time as another table right next to us. We ordered alittle before them. Both tables drinks arrived at the same time. No problems so far, then after 40 MINS our food arrived, 25 MINS after our neighbor table. They brought out 3 plates and forgot our daughters meal. Our waitress goes ""Oh sorry ill put that in"" REALLY. We werent going to sit there and eat in front of her. The manager comes over and says "" We are so sorry, would you like us to reheat this while you wait?"" ARE YOU SERIOUS its Rare Steak Fajits......They will be hard as rocks... At this point we have waited 50 Mins to eat. We were over it. We decided to get up and leave and order a local BBQ Joint to deliver through Uber Eats back to our Marriott. I would suggest you take pointers from us.....Skip the FOREVER WAIT and eat somewhere they care that you are spending your money at.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-windsor,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
