41,S K.,"Woodstock, GA",0,36,6.0,1.0,2012-03-24,"What happened to our neighborhood Chili's?  We could always count on going to Chili's for a decent meal before the movies or just a place to dine with the family.  This visit to Chili's wasn't so good.  Granted it has been sometime since we've been there, for a nationwide chain to have gone the way this Chili's has gone is inexcusable. The service was sub par, my wife had to ask for crackers three time before receiving them, in fact she finished her bowl of chili long before they arrived.  She said her salad was good, tough to mess that up I suppose.  My entree was horrible.  I ordered a new item from their menu, the Philly Cheese Steak sandwich.  First of all they didn't put any cheese that I could tell on the sandwich.  Second, the meat was far a few between, more peppers and onions than meat.  Third, the meat - it had a very plastic taste and hate to say it, but almost a rancid flavor.  My stomach is not feeling all that well right now.  Side note, the fries were good. The employees seemed more interested in socializing among themselves, creating a bit of a stir in the far back seating area of the establishment where they were rolling silverware.  A member of management was there eating his Reuben sandwich, allowing this behavior one booth away from ours.  Seriously, there must be somewhere else in the establishment this can take place, perhaps the ""back of the house"". I suspect the Chili's Corporation is keeping this location alive; but that may change soon when they realize the financial burden is too costly.  Time to flip management staff",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-woodstock?start=40,2.6280000000000006,2.6280000000000006,2.6280000000000006,2.6280000000000006,2.628000000000001

It took far too long to get any service from anyone. The staff seemed confused and nobody knew what the other was doing.  When our appetizer finally arrived, it was missing the sauce and the girl who delivered it didn't ask if we needed anything. By the time we flagged down an employee and got the missing part of the appetizer, the main course had appeared.  The server was awful and looked dirty, which is disconcerting in a restaurant. When this particular server actually visited our table, he didn't look at us.

The Texas cheese fries were cool when they came out and had to use a knife and fork to separate the fries since the ""melted"" cheese was solid again. My entree was warm but not hot.  The chicken crispers were almost rock hard.  My daughters fajitas were actually good and well thankfully she let me eat her onions and peppers.   It was her idea to come here as I wanted to dine at a bistro that we never tried before.  Next time mom will choose the restaurant! They now have a pay at table service and while it is convenient it is very impersonal as no one ever thanked us for coming or anything.  We never saw the server once she pointed to us using this.  It was also filthy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-woodstock?start=20,2.732,2.732,2.732,2.732,2.7320000000000007

29,Kate M.,"Dunwoody, GA",218,141,77.0,3.0,2014-10-16,"This Chili's is similar to others I've visited - no better, no worse. You know exactly what you're getting and the experience is predictable. I visited this location with my brother and we were seated immediately on a weekday evening. The interior was definitely upgraded since the last time I had visited and it looked nice, until we got to the table. Now the have mini-screens available for you to play games, order food, pay your bill, etc. You can also watch tv and clips from online sources. Uhhh isn't the point of going out to dinner with someone to make conversation with them? As if looking at our phones all the time wasn't bad enough, now we have another screen to add into the mix! Our server was friendly and helpful. I definitely didn't want to replace him with a computer screen! He was able to answer our questions and get our orders in promptly. One thing I loved seeing was that they have expanded their 2 for $20 menu. There are a lot more choices in the entrees section and they have included LC or lighter choice option as well. It made it a lot easier for me to go for the veggies than my usual chicken crispers.  The food itself was pretty standard. First came the appetizer (mozzarella sticks) and the person from the kitchen was certainly in a hurry. He came out, through the dish down along with plates, and at a speed where if you blinked you would have missed it, he was gone again! He didn't say anything, threw the food down, and didn't offer to refill our drinks which were noticeably empty. I'm all for prompt service but there wasn't really any serving in this equation - it was a drop and dash. The sticks themselves were pretty cool and the marinara lukewarm. I was glad they didn't immediately burn my mouth but I would have liked them at least a little hotter. My brother got the chicken crispers and he loved them as always. Crispy, gooey, and well seasoned, I was happy to steal a few bites. I got the 6 oz. sirloin with broccoli. I didn't care much for the pico de gallo topping on it, but the steak was cooked well and the broccoli still retained some crispness. I hate mushy vegetables and was glad to see that there was actually some semblance of crunch when I dug in. Our waiter came through a few more times to bring us refills, make sure everything tasted good, and offered some dessert offerings. We politely passed and he told me that if I was paying with a card I could swipe it right there at the reader on the table. After following the instructions I was able to determine my tip and a receipt printed out for me to take. They offered options for no receipt and email receipt as well. I guess this was a handy feature and you know the final total with tip since the server won't need to re-run your card afterwards. I just hope this technology doesn't replace the quality assistance servers provide. I can see it helping even the scale though if they are understaffed or overwhelmed with customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-woodstock?start=20,2.54,2.54,2.54,2.54,2.54

Also, the chocolate molten lava cake with vanilla ice cream is awesome.  Vegetarians won't find too many options, but there are some (i.e. mac and cheese, apples and cinnamon, rice and beans, etc.). I tend to come for the chips and guac and of course the desert.  Oh, and yes it can get busy during the week later in the evening, but that's probably a good indication that the food is good.  The staff is friendly, by the way.  Good place to go!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-woodstock?start=20,2.676,2.676,2.676,2.676,2.676

I walked in expecting to be greeted by someone, but after waiting a few minutes without seeing any employees, I decided to goto the bar area.  There were 3 gentlemen at the bar already, so I saddled up to the bar to get a good meal on a Monday night. The bartender was kept busy with orders from around Chilis for a good 5 minutes before looking my direction. I finally got my drink and meal order in. I ordered the Sweet and Smoky Craft burger. 15 minutes later, he comes back to me and states that they have run out of onion rings. I find that odd for a light Monday night, but okay. Give me fries instead. Finally, the food comes out. The pickles that are hyped beyond belief - taste like they were left in dirty dishwater. The burger - looks and tastes like Wendy's burgers, for twice the price. The fries - very small handful, but edible.

I placed an order to pick up after work last week, looking forward to having a nice meal as soon as I got home. When I arrived at this location, I waited briefly in my car as I had chosen the curb-side service online. After not being served, I decided to go inside to get my food.  I then waited at the ""To-Go"" counter for 5 minutes as NO ONE acknowledged my existence. At least 4 different employees made eye-contact with me, but I received no, ""Can I help you?"", no ""Just one minute"", no ""Someone will be right with you"". Nothing.  (to clarify: I don't mind waiting 5-10 minutes for my food, but I expect to be greeted within the first minute or two) Finally someone came up to me and asked if I had been helped. I said no, and another associate eventually came to take my card, placed the receipt on the counter for me to sign, and walked away. No ""sorry for the wait"", no ""thank you"", no ""have a nice evening"". Again, nothing. Needless to say, I was highly disappointed with my experience at this location (Chili's on Towne Lake Pkwy next to the QT), and I will not be returning.

I almost always get the Buffalo Ranch Chicken Sandwich & fries at Chili's.  It's simply a great sandwich!  They seem to have made the bun smaller to make the chicken look larger, but there was no reason for this.  The chicken breast on this sandwich has always been huge!  The only thing I would change is give the option of blue cheese instead of ranch to compliment the buffalo sauce. We sit in the bar area where there's usually open tables and plenty of sports channels on.  The free kid's meals coupons through e-mail are nice, but they kind of screwed up the new rewards program.  Can't use the coupons and redeem rewards at the same time.  If I've EARNED the rewards then I should be able to cash them in without limitations, right?

13,Nicole C.,"Acworth, GA",0,11,,1.0,2017-05-12,"Lord... Where do I begin. The only reason I am writing a review this long is because we've given this location at least 10 chances hoping it would get better because we LOVE the Chili's on Barrett Parkway, but this location is right down the road from me now. 1. My boyfriend and I have given this location too many chances like I said. Constantly empty, yet we are asked our name and told to wait when I can clearly see 15 booths open. Why should we have to wait, when the restaurant isn't even busy...? 2. When we have been seated, we literally wait 15 minutes for someone to greet us and ask for drinks. I am not exaggerating. We started a stop watch from the moment we sat down and gave the server 15 minutes (ridiculously generous) to get to us before we said we would walk out. I was a server at an extremely busy restaurant before, and let me tell you - if we didn't approach the table within *30 seconds* of customers sitting down we were in trouble. However, many servers (including the manager I can only assume) walked by our table there numerous times and said nothing. By some miracle, a server came up 13 minutes into the test and greeted us with no apology... As if they had no idea we had even been there? Sigh. 3. Very understaffed. I can only assume the turnover rate is up the roof. The staff don't communicate and have no idea who has already spoken to customers, whose table belongs to who, etc. After giving our drink order to the boy that approached us first, another girl came up and asked us what we wanted to drink. Next, after we ordered the queso and chips appetizer and it was brought to us... the girl brought another batch out and looked surprised that we had gotten our food. She literally said: ""oh, these aren't for you?"" we shook our heads. She then turned around and said to the other table ""well would you guys like free chips and queso"" and set it down. Are you kidding me? 4. Our drinks weren't filled ever again through the entire meal. And it took a good 20 minutes of sitting with dirty, empty dishes in front of us to get our check.  I think it's safe to say we will not be coming back... which is too bad because we really wanted to like this location :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-woodstock,3.2,3.2,3.2,,3.2000000000000006
10,Bob S.,"Cumming, GA",0,6,,1.0,2017-05-31,Salad came out with 5 times the dressing anyone could eat.  Dinner/ sides came out 15 mins apart.  Didn't get refills for drinks were very slow and we had to chase waiter through another waiter.  Food was ok. The new fried chicken was very good.  Service poor.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-woodstock,3.2,3.2,3.2,,3.2000000000000006
9,Lindsey F.,"Woodstock, GA",110,8,7.0,1.0,2017-05-31,I don't know why I keep going here thinking I will have a different experience but every time I come here the service is terrible.  I went at 1230 today for lunch with my children on my lunch break and I sat for 22 minutes and no one had greeted me even after I asked for a manager so we finally had to walk out.  Ridiculous.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-woodstock,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005
18,Ed H.,"Woodstock, GA",0,2,,1.0,2017-06-18,"Just ate the location. Not busy ,9:15 at night. Server forgot the appetizer, when food finally got to the table after 50 minutes everything was very cold. Worse location I have every visited.

17,Kevin H.,"Woodstock, GA",1,14,,1.0,2017-06-24,"We walked in and the hostess said they recently had a power outage and were trying to reboot their computers, and would be unable to seat anyone for 15-20 min.  The power was on, they were serving food, and using terminals to print receipts.  How can you not wear anyone in a clean, empty seat?  They can cook.  I have cash.  Has our society become so dependent on someone being able to push a button that we can't handle a piece of paper for an order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-woodstock,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8
12,Brian N.,"Woodstock, GA",0,3,,1.0,2017-06-27,"Great location in Woodstock.  Very reasonable priced beer.  Friendly staff. But, the restaurant has big issues.  Our dinner this past weekend took 2.5 hours.  The managers were cooking.  The waitress, who warned us, took 30 minutes to deliver our beer.  The place was a mess, with multiple tables covered with dirty dishes and food.  The food was OK, but waiting 90 minutes was a bit much.  Of course, we paid full price!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-woodstock,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72

7,Natalie B.,"Woodstock, GA",24,18,4.0,1.0,2017-07-30,"Just left Chili's and am shocked by the experience. We waited 5 minutes or more before someone greeted us at the door (other people ahead of us left because it took so long). As we were being seated, we were walked past at least 6 dirty tables. The bathrooms (both) were extremely unkept/dirty as well. As we were eating, we could see and hear the kitchen staff horsing around (spraying each other with a water-filled glove), and we also heard them yell out explicative words several times.  The food was also subpar compared to what I have had in the past. My chicken salad was over saturated with dressing. The one positive is the young man who was our waiter (Michael? Mitchell?). He was excellent! Very attentive and sweet. Unfortunately I don't think we will be back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-woodstock,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
6,Kristy R.,"Woodstock, GA",49,6,,4.0,2017-11-13,"I don't know why this location has such terrible reviews. I feel like most people who go to chain restaurants are the WORST. I have been here probably around 10 times and have never had a bad experience. Sure, we may have a different server every time, but the service is always prompt, friendly, and accommodating. The food is always delish as well. Never had to send anything back. Maybe this location went through a rough patch, or maybe a bunch of asshole yelpers have taken up arms against them, but I think this Chili's is a solid 4 stars. My only complaint is BRING BACK THE CORONARITA!!!!! Can I start a petition?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-woodstock,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
2,Andrew M.,"Canton, GA",22,10,1.0,1.0,2017-11-16,Chance after chance. Just got home with hot fries I had to wait on btw and fridge held tacos. They were never cooked. It's obvious by the fact that the cheese isn't melted. So tired of the bad experiences. On more than one occasion I've dined in and been forgotten about. Sat two hours waiting for food and then only offered a free dessert as compensation. You must be kidding yourselves Chili's. You have an issue at this location and it's been long term. I expect to be refunded for poor service and uncooked food not glad handed with a free dessert. Complete and utter BS.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-woodstock,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
1,Ryan C.,"Canton, GA",59,8,,1.0,2017-11-21,"It's just as the other reviews state. We waited 15 minutes for someone to take our drink order. We also ordered an appetizer we never got. The food was cold when it came out 55 minutes after we ordered. This wouldn't be an issue but there was literally only 4-5 other tables that had people in the entire restaurant. When our food arrived, I reminded the waitress that we didn't get our appetizer. She apologized and stated she forgot. No big deal, things happen. But she also never came back with refills. Not once. We finished our meal with no drinks.  We will not be back. This is about the third time I've had a bad experience at this location.  Stay far away from Chilis on Towne Lake Pkwy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-woodstock,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
4,Jeff P.,"Marietta, GA",0,5,,2.0,2017-11-27,"Decided to give this location one last try. Stopped in at 7:15 on a Monday night and was one of three customers at the bar. The bartender greeted me promptly and courteously, brought my drink, amswered questions about the menu and took my order while we had a breif conversation. Never saw her again. Food took about 35 minutes to come out. No one came by to update me on the progress of my order, ask how things were once delivered or if I needed a beverage ( I did ) Finished my meal and waited 15 minutes to get someone's attention to bring me a check, which they did and left promptly while I was opening my wallet to pay so I could finally leave. Thought perhaps I could pay with a card on the tabletop unit and go.  It wasn't working properly. Covered the check with change I could make on my own and left it on the bar. Did I mention I was one of only three people at the bar? Wow",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-woodstock,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36
3,Hali M.,"Woodstock, GA",231,11,,2.0,2017-11-28,"I've had good and bad experiences at this location over the years but the last few times have been so bad, I will drive to barrett parkway if I really am in the mood for chili's (which let's be honest is not super often) The staff is rude, you're hardly greeted at the door, the wait is insane (if you even choose to stay) and something is always wrong with your order. Last time we went, my fries were cold and they messed us several things about our order. Just not worth it. There's too many other good restaurants in this area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-woodstock,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28
8,Mike B.,"Seattle, WA",0,9,,1.0,2017-12-03,"Horrible service. Went there before a local church service. This review sounds like Ryan's below. After a half hour- three people came by and said, ""Oh we thought you were already done."" My son then thought he saw one of the waiters put our order in. Then 2o minutes later the food arrived finally- cold with wilted lettuce, and soggy cold fries. They offered us a free dessert but why bother. It has been along time since I demured not to tip at a restaurant, but this was extraordiarily bad. Never again. Goodby  Chilis -you gave me the willies. Three other tables next to us were served while we somehow disappeared.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-woodstock,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28
5,Kara M.,"Atlanta, GA",0,1,,1.0,2017-12-12,I sat at the bar and maybe saw my bartender a total of 5 minutes behind the bar the entire hour or so I was there. I ordered a ribeye mid rare and it came out well done but I never got the chance to tell my server about it since she barely came around. The restaurant is nice but service lacks badly,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-woodstock,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16
0,Danielle L.,"Woodstock, GA",158,2,,4.0,2018-01-10,"The food and our service was great, we came in 30 minutes before close. However, the staff and kitchen we're making snarky remarks on how we got there 30 minutes before close. We are both servers and made it a point to tip well and be out of there before closing time. Honestly it was just very unprofessional and the server we had was amazing but we will not be returning due to the negativity at this specific location. We tipped generously because our server was excellent and understanding. But this was such a rude experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-woodstock,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28
