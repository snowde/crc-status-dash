We had the combo fajitas and I have to say they were more than sub-par. I want my money back. There are a lot of options on 544 so keep on driving past this Chili's.

Oh well, After gagging on the smoke last time we were there (and at the time I was a smoker), my wife decided to try them again.  BIG MISTAKE.  We had a couple margaritas, they were tasty. The onion rings were good as well.  Then came the entrees, my steak was average.  I got the southwestern Mac and cheese.  It came out cold.  Our awesome waitress quickly took it back and the floor manager brought us a fresh one.  Basic restaurant procedures 101.  So far so good.  Then my wife tasted her chicken ranch quesadillas.  Tasteless and dry.  We brought it to our waitress' attention and she agreed.  She knew it sucked.  Then I took it a step further and took out a piece of the chicken.  I'm not sure when it was cut, but I would be surprised if it was today.  It had that yellowish color on top and just bone dry.  I had the steak. It was cooked right but not seasoned at all.  When the floor manager came over, and we told her about the quesadillas, she agreed.  She also knew the sucked.  She then said that other quesadillas that had more juicy ingredients helped.  Wow. The breath of fresh air was the waitress.  Her name was Jessica.  She took everything in stride, knowing that her table was unhappy.  She made us laugh and she is the ONLY reason that I am not in a horrible mood right now.  If you ever go to this location, which I do not suggest, ask for her section.   When I think of Chilis, I think of average.  This location was far below that.  I will never be back.  If I am with a group that demands on going there, I will walk across the street to Wendy's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wylie-3?start=40,1.3800000000000003,1.3800000000000003,1.3800000000000003,1.3800000000000003,1.3800000000000003

Let me start by saying that I've been going to Chilis for years snd we go to this one frequently.  I'm not complaining about the waitress, she was nice, the service complaint is that it took an unusually long time for our food to come out, especially considering that at around 3 in the afternoon the place wasn't busy.  As for the quality, we ordered chips and salsa, the salsa was almost as thin as water, which was disappointing as that is one of our favorite items at Chilis, we later asked the waitress if they had any thicker salsa and she looked disappointed and said no, the General manager wanted it made thin like that.  Our other complaint about the food is the baby back ribs came out dry just warm not hot, and the extra bbq sauce that we were served must have come directly from the fridge as it was cold.  Hope they fix things here, it's a convenient go to place, and there's not a whole lot else to choose from in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wylie-3?start=60,1.4800000000000002,1.4800000000000002,1.4800000000000002,1.4800000000000002,1.4800000000000002

Ordered 2 Oldtimers with cheese.  Both were overcooked despite discussing specifically what we wanted.  One was ordered without a bun and with mustard on the side.  No mustard and the cheese was still placed on top of the meat so most of it stuck to the foil.  Flip it over before wrapping. How hard is that?  The fries were cooked in old grease and were stale,  I was waiting at the restaurant as it came out so it wasn't that they sat too long.  Overall, awful. Hadn't done Chili's in a year and now I remember why. Too many other choices. Chili's has lost their touch.

63,Jen W.,"Caddo Mills, TX",1,10,,1.0,2015-01-28,"This is my second horrible experience with this location. This time I ordered the Mango Chile Chicken only to find NO mango in the salsa topping but MACARONI and CHEESE!!! OMG. Where did that come from? Also my plate was not served with broccoli? Just rice and the chicken! Waitress tells me broc is coming, as it was also missing from the husbands dinner as well. Rice was room temp at best.  The chicken, when I sliced a small bite was WAAAY over spiced with the chili sauce and sent my mouth in to four alarm fire!! Finally, the sauce was dried all on the plate, as if it had been sitting for way too long under a heat lamp. Did I mention it took way to much time to get our food brought out?? I finally flagged down the waitress again (each time we had to locate her) and launched my complaint. She retorted with ""it's a spicy dish!"" I was shocked, I fired back, that I'd eaten this dish before and never has been this spicy, and also the macaroni and cheese issue, and missing broc still hasn't arrived, pointed out the dried on sauce on the plate and that I wanted to return my dish to the kitchen. She finally took it and sent the manager over to apologize and he then reminded me it's a spicy dish--really, I covered that again with him. He offered to bring out margarita chicken dish for me and that surprisingly came out of the kitchen quickly. We then got another waiter, since the original girl didn't like me sending my mango chile chicken back. Was just an awful experience that didn't need to happen. Young people, especially in service jobs: it's not forever, it's not your food; if someone complains, listen, apologize and make it right.

The chips come out and they are so oily that the oil off one of the chips drips off! they are all glistening. Not at all how chips should look like. Just nasty. I also hate being charged for the ranch I think that's silly but I will pay for it. They change the menu what feels like every other month and raise the prices to just ridiculous prices.

I'm not a smoker- but do find it somewhat nostalgic to be at a bar with people smoking...I somewhat like it- to a point. What's not nostalgic are these ridiculous vapor cigs. They put out a ridiculous cloud of something- it's disgusting. It completely worse than cig smoke imo. The service was ridicules. I sat at the bar for 15mins before being acknowledged. There were only 7 people at the bar...shouldn't be hard to get some eye contact at least. I know the bartender (use the term loosely) has to make drinks for the tables as well; but it appeared she had been prioritizing the main smoke contributors- most likely due to one of them appearing to be her sister or close relative.

I will not be going back- at least for a long while (year?)...my Wylie rest business will be going to Frankie's or The Rock; both better experiences all around.

It was clearly not grilled, no grill marks and it was a white opaque color, except for the seasoning on the top. It was in a bed of sizzling peppers and onions, but it was by no means sizzling.  It was sad and gross.  I asked the manager how they prepared the chicken & he said they run it through an oven on a conveyer belt... NOT the way fajitas should be prepared. I asked him when they started cooking it that way. He said for as long as he's been there, a year and a half. The Cajun Chicken Pasta chicken was cooked the same way and it looked gross too. The pasta itself was cold. The only savings grace was the sliders and fries. We have been eating at Chilis since they first opened in Dallas many many years ago. The fajitas have been a favorite.  It's sad that conveyer belt cooking, instead of grilling, is the way they prepare their chicken.

We place our order and did not ask for anything special, you know - the can I have onion rings instead of fries. We also ask for Queso, usually something that simple comes out in 5 minutes or less. 10 minutes later.....however it was all good. Wait person comes by checks all drinks ask if we want more chips.  Yes, we have already eat all the chips and Queso. At lease the second order of chips came quicker.  Still waiting on food 30 minutes now.  Finally, one of the Hostess comes by and I ask if she could get our wait person to check on our order.  Wait person finally show up apologies for the delay and that the manager has been informed and will come talk to us.  What year was that suppose to happen?   Ahh, there he is!   He too apologies and stated the kitchen was running slow.  Really?!?!, then why did those people that came in behind us get their food already? Maybe they ordered on the Chili's App.  The manager then offered us dessert on him, well ok.  Wasn't going to get dessert but ok.   Our food finally arrives.  I ordered the Mango-Chili Chicken, the mango-chili sauce was very good and had a spicy kick that built up as you ate it, however my avocados had turned brown already.  Geez, just how long had they been sitting out? Maybe they had time to eat two bowls of chips too.  The rice was white rice that had no taste and dry, but the steamed broccoli was just right. The chicken was just a bit day, but if they had giving more of the yummy mango sauce it would have worked.  M-I-L ordered the steak, don't ask - IDK.  We keep telling her only get steak at steak houses. The salad was wilted and the steak could barely be cut with the knife, and yes we had to ask for utensils.  But not all is lost, we have dessert on the manager!  So, now we a bit full so we will ask for it to go.  4 cheesecakes to go, please.  Wait person says she will go talk to the manager. What? Why?  Didn't he says dessert is on him?  Manager visits us again....well... ""When I said dessert was on me..............I meant only one dessert"".  OH! Why didn't you say that before?

Finally he shows up, asks how many in our group we say two and we would prefer a booth, he says we only have one right now and it was right by the door/host desk. I don't like sitting where people are basically on top of me so I said, not its fine we will take a table. He then says it will be a 15 min wait because they're busy but we could sit anywhere in the bar area. I see PLENTY open tables in the main dining area, but we just decided to go to the bar. Which in my opinion, if you're too busy to serve people in the main dining area, why is it ok to then seat people in the bar? If your servers can't handle full sections, than they need to be given to someone who can. Anyways, after we sat, we were greeted promptly by a server who was CLEARLY in the weeds... He asked what we wanted to drink... 20 min later were still waiting.. Brings us waters and try's to give us chips and salsa we did not order.. Forgot my margarita.. 10 more min go by after seeing my marg made and just sitting on the bar he picks it up, sets it on a random part of the bar, then goes and serves other tables their food. When he is done comes back up to the random place he sat it at, picked it up and gave it to me. Like seriously? Someone could have easily just picked it up and walked off or slipped something in there.. What were you thinking?? What makes it worse is I kid you not I do not think there was ANY alcohol in my beverage. Anyways, my bf and I got the 2 for $20. Ordered the fries as an appetizer which came out fine, then he got a bacon cheeseburger and I got the ancho crusted steak which is supposed to include fries, asparagus and a dipping sauce...I asked for it RARE. The manager brought out our food and asked me to cut into my steak, it was medium well, no fries or dipping sauce... At this point we had been waiting for so long on everything with bad service I just said it was fine and tried to enjoy the time with my bf...Had to flag our server down to order, get refills, to go boxes, the check...

I also like to get their 6 oz sirloin which comes with two sides and they always get my steak cooked right to my liking, rare.

The only redeeming quality here is that they have a computer at the table so you can pay your bill right there and get the hell out of this place as soon as humanly possible.  They were the first business in Wylie many many years ago and battled hard with the landowners just to be allowed to obtain a liquor license.

The chili was not something I would order again. Bad tasting with some strange ingredients. To top it off the soda crackers were stale. The quesadilla was like cardboard and tasted the same way. It's like it was made yesterday and kept under a heat lamp and left to cool afterwards.  Not good.  When I went to use the restroom there was no soap in the dispenser. Big fail.
