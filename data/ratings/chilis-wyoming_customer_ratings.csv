26,Terri H.,"Byron Center, MI",15,27,31.0,4.0,2012-01-22,"Met the family for a Sunday lunch at noon.  When I got there there was just a few cars in the parking lot and I was worried they were closed.  But we got seated right away and had a great serve,(added a star for that).   We shared fajitas, my sister had a Santa Fe Chicken Wrap and a friend had the grilled salmon.  This was all topped off with a Molten Chocolate Cake, yum.  Over all a good meal with great service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wyoming?start=20,2.32,2.32,2.32,2.32,2.32
21,Joshua S.,"Grand Rapids, MI",65,168,144.0,3.0,2012-02-28,"This is my local Chili's, or actually the only one on this side of town since the one in Rivertown closed a few years back.  I've always had quick service and quality food at this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wyoming?start=20,,,,,
23,M J.,"Fort Wayne, IN",36,103,3.0,4.0,2012-05-10,We had a late lunch here on Saturday. The place was pretty much empty.  I hadn't been to Chili's in a long time and I was pleasantly surprised.  My salad was fantastic!  Service was ok.  Bathrooms were very clean.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wyoming?start=20,,,,,
18,Rose S.,"Freeport, MI",79,20,,1.0,2013-03-22,"This looks like any other Chili's and was clean and presentable. The staff was very friendly. My husband's food was good, and my children enjoyed theirs. I ordered the Honey-Chipotle Crispers, which I have always loved at other Chili's locations. They were awful - the breading was gummy and the chicken inside was cold. The staff took care of it right away and replaced my meal with fajitas. They came on a sizzling platter but the chicken was clearly microwaved (based on taste, texture, and appearance.) I stirred them around and discovered that the onions and peppers were refrigerator cold, except for where they were touching the platter. I asked a server if the chicken was microwaved. She said no, but it was cooked the day before. I will not be going back to this restaurant. Although the staff was friendly and attentive, the food was not worth the money and I will choose a different Chili's location next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wyoming,,,,,
22,Aaron O.,"Wyoming, MI",16,82,13.0,4.0,2013-04-26,I think of myself as a foodie but not a food snob. I was a bit skeptical about whether or not I would like the food. I ate on a sat night there was about a ten min wait which is quite reasonable for anywhere on a weekend. we were seated in the bar section which I thought was a little weird but it worked. The server was friendly and answered our questions with a clear knowledge of the menu. We started with the trio of apps. The portions were generous and the food was well prepared. My guest and I  both had burgers which were cooked to our specified temps and were equally proportionate. Desert was a molten lava cake that was warm and nicely textured. A good experience for us we will be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wyoming?start=20,,,,,
13,Brad M.,"Fort Worth, TX",205,517,160.0,4.0,2013-09-20,"Ahhh... Chili's!  Baby Back Ribs (are you singing?) and Big Mouth Burgers! Actually my very favorite thing here is the fajitas!  Without the Tortilla!  I know... but just dump everything (including the carbs) and it's a fantastic meal. The onions are cooked seperately here (which means no tiny, burnt chunks stuck to your plate).... but they are cooked in an ""au jus"" which has kind of a BBQ/Steak Sauce flavor to it. However, what I like about Chili's is exactly what you are supposed to like about Chili's... it's the same wherever you go!  Decent Food, Decent Prices, and good service! 4 Solid Stars!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wyoming,,,,,
19,Joey M.,"Grand Rapids, MI",51,53,,4.0,2014-10-14,"Always good food and drinks  I like fajita Republic atmosphere  better but like chili's food and drinks  better.  Cozy bar,  clean atmosphere",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wyoming,,,,,
17,Jarod L.,"Avilla, IN",14,12,3.0,2.0,2014-12-10,Server was not paying attention when taking order. Pizza on wheat toast?.....really and a mess up of a chicken bowl and gave grilled chicken. Service was slow and several others were asking for discounts on there bills. I could not tell you our servers name due to the lack of name badges on any of the staff! I guess they don't want to be named for poor service to Corp,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wyoming,,,,,
16,Rob O.,"Waterford Township, MI",9,9,17.0,3.0,2015-04-19,"Arrived at 7:30 on a Saturday evening.  Okay not the best time for a chain resturant but whatcha gonna do when you've got Grandma (who was itching for a Chilli's), the two kids, the wife and your brother-in-law with his wife? Party of 7 with no boosters or highchairs.  Our little one sits like a big girl now (she's 3).  At first they offered to put two tables together and we were fine.  Then they changed their minds and put all 7 of us at a table for 6 with one of us sitting in the walk way.  Then in the middle of the table is this MASSIVE electronic device.  Okay.  Fine, we'll pull a Tim Gunn and make it work. Service?  Spot on.  Our server was timely, checked in regularly, and did her best to manage all the tables she had.  Food?  Amazingly good.  It was my second burger of the day (it's a long story) and it was perfect from start to finish.  Space to fit 7 meals, drinks, and this wacky ""Ziosk""?  No.  Not happening.  I felt like at any moment someone was going to sneeze and I was going to be wearing my Old Fashioned in my lap.   Oh, and of course this Ziosk is flashing for the 3 yo a list of games to play.  Good!  Swipe your credit card for $1.99 to get access.  Not so good.... plus we could purchase half the games they had available on our phones for $.99 or for free and have them forever.  So asside from taking up the space of a dinner plate, blocking view, and just being there, it was also a useless distraction. Going back?  Probably because the best part of a chain is you know what to expect.  But we could totally do better if we're feeling adventurous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wyoming,,,,,
9,R H.,"Zeeland, MI",0,17,1.0,2.0,2016-01-20,"The waiter was seemingly in his own world, and when asked about things on the menu he would get a far off dreamy look in his eyes and eventually come to the conclusion that he didn't know.  The food was a bit odd. Edible but nothing to brag about or make us eager to come back.   I'd return if an interested friend really wanted to but not of my own volition.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wyoming,,,,,
15,Scott K.,"Saranac, MI",13,8,,1.0,2016-03-18,"Ordered lunch online, pickup scheduled for 11:57, arrive at 11:52, actually received food at 12:20.  Bottom line never again will they get my business",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wyoming,,,,,
12,Priscilla B.,"Wyoming, MI",2,2,,1.0,2016-03-31,"Terrible service. Waitress took 10 minutes to greet table. She messed up our very simple order causing us to wait additional 20 minutes for food to come out. Then upon serving order she realized she still had it wrong. And forgot to bring salad dressing for a salad. All we heard from her every time she came to table was ""Oops, I forgot."" The food was great but will not be returning to this establishment again",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wyoming,,,,,
20,Erica H.,"Wyoming, MI",0,8,1.0,1.0,2016-05-09,the inside seemed somewhat new and clean we were hungry so we ordered .. It went down hill from there the food took for ever and nothing looked like the pictures on the menu the waitress was nice but slow and was not attentive in any way .. The over all quality of the food was garbage  bland and sloppy over priced .. It was my daughters birthday dinner and not one worker new how to sing happy birthday.?? How is that even possible ?..Our family loves chilies but this location needs new management and definitely  needs a new cook!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wyoming?start=20,,,,,
5,Sharan K.,"Auburn Hills, MI",52,207,702.0,3.0,2016-06-04,"Checked in for a quick lunch here, as we were on a group business trip visit to the Grand Rapids area. We were 8 but were seated quickly. Service was good for a chain restaurant.  Tried the Fresco Salad, since it looked new. It was OK.but healthy :) Had the Avocado chicken sandwich, tasted fine,more of a half sandwich. Liked the fries, nice and thick although I felt there were too few.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wyoming,,,,,
10,Chuck M.,"Grand Rapids, MI",0,3,,1.0,2016-07-08,We thought we'd try Chilli's to go and it was terrible. Not only was the lady on the phone snarky but she got 50% of it wrong. We ordered chips and she tripled the order costing us $26extra. The chips were not what I asked for even though she strongly stated it was.  When I picked up the food the young man behind the counter ignored me when I went up to his empty cashier. When I started to ask if this was the right place he said he was in the middle of working on entering an order.  This has to be one of the most expensive worst meals we've had. I would NOT recommend this service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wyoming,,,,,
11,Alexis E.,"Livonia, MI",0,5,2.0,1.0,2016-07-21,"That was the worst service I have ever experienced. I've been a server for the past 3 years so I'm usually understanding of thing but our server had no excuse. First, I ordered a margarita and watched it sit at the bar for a full 15 minutes and she still had the audacity to give me a watered down margarita. Then she messed up our order completely so we waited 40 mins for the correct food. To top it all off we ask for a box 3 times, never got  it, so my friend ended up wrapping her damn quesadillas in a napkins just so we could get the hell out of there. I will never ever return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wyoming,,,,,
14,Peter B.,"Grand Rapids, MI",2,21,,2.0,2016-08-09,"It's been awhile since I've been to Chilli's, but we were over on that side of town and went last Friday night for early dinner.  Not at all good.  The waitress was fine - attentive and friendly, but the rest of the dinner was a bust. My burger was entirely flavorless and waaaaaay overcooked - the fries were not hot and soggy.  My friend got the quesadilla and it was like someone was playing a joke on here.  Dusty flavorless tortillas, with such a scant amount of cheese and filling, just one greasy, dusty bite after another.  Our choice of beers was limited to the usual Budweiser/Coors/Miller list - no craft beers, no local beers, and not a single IPA.  This seems like a place for sorority girls to get drunk on pink and green smoothies before going out - this is not a place to get food anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wyoming,,,,,
7,Chad R.,"Wyoming, MI",0,6,1.0,2.0,2016-09-27,"I live close and come to this location quite a bit. I use (To Go) all of the time. The last 3 times I've used (To Go) my order has messed up. The first time I let go, the second time I called. And was told I could drive back to get it fixed. This time I wanted to write something. I ordered the shrimp tacos the last two times. Both times, simply asked for no Pico. It was on both meals. If you order (To Go) check ALL of your boxes before you leave.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wyoming,,,,,
6,Kori Y.,"Grand Rapids, MI",50,362,31.0,2.0,2016-10-26,"Either this location, or the chain as a whole seems to be loosing it's appeal. The service here was mediocre at best, but at least it matched the food. With so many food options around, I'd skip this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wyoming,,,,,
8,Safet A.,"Plainwell, MI",73,3,,3.0,2016-11-19,"Been here two times and unless someone else is paying I will not come back. The burgers are not the best, stale bun and the burger wasn't juicy to any point at all. The Cajun pasta is my favorite thing on the menu, although the breadstick could be replaced with something a little more gourmet for $13.99! Otherwise I'd stick to simple dishes like enchiladas which pair alright with a cold corona. Chips and salsa also get 3 of 5, which are disappointing for a restaurant who boasts a Mexican flair.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wyoming,,,,,
3,Brad P.,"Springfield, MO",31,159,118.0,2.0,2017-01-16,"I'm not really sure where to start. First of all their parking situation is not good, especially if weather is poor like it was during my visit.  All the reviews I've read about the place were spot on.  I was traveling along for business, so I sat at the bar. The bartender was in way over her head. It took 8 minutes before she even approached me to welcome me. She then said she would right back but that was another five minutes. She was arguing with another man working behind the bar the entire time. He finally took my drink order. I requested a draft beer and a water. He said they were out of nitrous so they couldn't sell anymore draft beer. I ordered a bottled beer. Never did get my water.  I sat right next to the to go or carry out area. I listed to every person that came in for a pickup. At least two thirds of the order were either wrong or ""lost in the system"". A large majority of the people paid with gift cards, I assume they received as Christmas presents.  My meal was eventually severed. I order a second beer, bottle of course, and it was hot. The man ask me when I was done if I needed anything. I told him I'd have one last beer, but this second one is hot. He said, I told her not to pull them from here but to go to the back. I wanted to say, not my problem. He did comp me a cold beer.  It's just a very poorly managed property. I eat all the time. Tuesday nights are a slow night, but they just couldn't handle it. By looking at the GM, I'd say he's been there a while. With all the bad reviews, I surprised Chili corp hasn't sent in secret employees to watch an evening. To recap, you definitely need a new bartender, she had several ""arguments"" with the waitstaff about drinks. I'm sure her bad attitude carries over over to the staff and their table presentation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wyoming,,,,,
4,Jeff R.,"Westchester / LAX, Los Angeles, CA",0,4,6.0,1.0,2017-03-12,"Sunday afternoon, big party, 3 families. Food took longer than expected and our server was in the back so I flagged down one from a different table. I commented that it was taking a long time, and this server said ""it's only been 27 minutes...that's pretty good for a table of 13."" Some orders were cold or had been sitting under the warmer too long. Probably just a mixup in the kitchen (it happens) but the rude response was surprising.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wyoming,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
2,Jen L.,"Williamsburg, VA",68,4,6.0,1.0,2017-10-11,"Nothing I ordered was correct. $40 worth of food and not One napkin or piece of silverware?

0,Mackenzie W.,"Grand Rapids, MI",12,57,11.0,4.0,2017-10-13,"Stopped in after a local football game one cold wet Friday evening. Little did my family know that not only where we to be greeted with a warm interior but also by warm service. I can't recall if I've ever been to a Chili's but I didn't have my expectations set that high. I assumed it would par food served by a weary waiter/waitress. Surprised was I to say the least when the food was prompt, quick, and fresh. Nothing to rave about but good substance none the less. What was much more impressive was our waiter, Isaac. Not only was he helpful and nice but also funny, charming and made warmed all of our hearts. He seemed to genuinely enjoy his job and that is a rarity these days. Bravo good sir, bravo.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wyoming,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28
