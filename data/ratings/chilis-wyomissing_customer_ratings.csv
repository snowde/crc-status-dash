13,Mike B.,"Columbus, OH",4,5,2.0,1.0,2012-10-04,"Drinks 8/10 Service 6.5/10 Food 3/10 - sucks sucks sucks; normal chilis is fine but this one is deplorable beyond the chips and salsa.  Skillet queso is a greasy burnt mess (how?), wraps come out busted and missing sauces (dry lettuce), anything with chicken is Tyson frozen strips reheated.. or still frozen as with the wrap.  Pics to follow, this is the third time I've tried here because I've liked these places since childhood.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wyomissing,,,,,

22,Louis S.,"Harrisonburg, VA",0,1,,2.0,2013-05-08,Ribs were okay. Fries were terrible...meaning they were served to me cold. Fries as anyone knows are not worth eating COLD. I won't go back to this chili's.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wyomissing?start=20,,,,,
20,Patrick G.,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",1,2,,5.0,2013-10-23,"Just ate dinner here. Had the skillet queso appetizer and bacon ranch chicken quesadillas. The food was good. My server was excellent. The receipt spelled her name as ""Jena-veve"" and she was one of the best servers I've had in a while. Thanks!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wyomissing?start=20,,,,,
15,Kristi S.,"Blue Bell, PA",89,86,15.0,1.0,2013-11-11,"Had an awful experience here last night! I usually don't go to Chili's and now I have another reason not to. I ordered the grilled chicken salad with grilled shrimp instead and first my order didn't even come out with the rest of the dinners. Okay, no big deal I can wait a few minutes. But then, when it did finally come out I could tell the second I looked at the shrimp they were barely cooked! Raw shrimp?! Really? It takes about ten minutes to cook shrimp, even less if they are small but these were RAW in the center. I sent it back (I felt bad, our waitress was embarrassed) but then the manager brings back my shrimp after we had all pretty well finished our whole meal and it was the SAME shrimp reheated and looked disgusting! I've worked in restaurants and I know you aren't supposed to recook uncooked food that has already been touched by a customer. Then, when I said, ""wait, this is the old shrimp.. They just tried to reheat it."" The manager tried to tell me IT WASN't! I'm like, ""Uh there are two shrimp here cut in half. Ones I cut and realized they were raw. It's THE SAME shrimp."" He totally recoiled and took the shrimp back, didn't even offer to give me anything else to eat! I was starving having eaten only salad greens with no protien. They never even offered us dessert. They Just quickly brought the check before we were even done eating. At least they had the decency to comp me for the salad. Over all, The quality of food and service was terrible And having walked by the kitchen it looked filty! Almost as bad as their bathrooms. I seriously recommend avoiding this Chilis!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wyomissing,,,,,
16,Dhayibeth V.,"Reading, PA",4,11,16.0,4.0,2014-04-28,"Their food is great, their dessert is amazing and the costumer service is good! But their water tastes really bad some times",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wyomissing,,,,,
14,Carl L.,"Denver, PA",0,8,,2.0,2014-07-18,"Don't order drinks without knowing the price! Ordered a Watermelon Marg., price was $7.99. $6.00 maybe , but $7.99? where are we, the Wells Fargo Center?  Hamburger was $10.99, probably worth it. Ordered mine medium-well, came out rare. Potato skin appetizer was good at $7.79. Tried to use their survey page, it never worked.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wyomissing,,,,,
12,Ren H.,"Reading, PA",78,13,1.0,1.0,2014-08-12,"Terrible to the point of nauseating. First, you get greeted by a nasty decor that sinply doesn't match. Dark greens, browns, and oddly placed tiles on the table gave a really poor and decrepit impression. I could barely pay attention to my food and friends because the decor was too distracting.   Second, our server, Kelsey, was very poor waitress. She barely made eye contact and barely put any effort to interact beyond what she needed to. She was rude and seemed rushed even though the restaurant barely had any diners. Third, the food was below subpar. The food was either bland or oversaturated with taste and they used materials that are low quality. The chicken was tough to chew, the pasta was tough to chew, and yes the boneless wings were tough to chew.   Don't bother with this restaurant at all. Even Applebee's holds a much better service, atmosphere, food, and more importantly, a better dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wyomissing,,,,,
21,Tim B.,"Reading, PA",1,8,,2.0,2014-10-23,"Well you have your choice here..disgusting food? Or terrible service? I ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich, the menu says it has buffalo sauce and ranch sounds good to me. Sandwich comes out so drenched in buffalo sauce that the bread is soggy, now I don't know what kind of bozo is in that kitchen but that's not how you make a buffalo chicken sandwich. My girl friends sizzling steal fajita was raw, my question for you is how do you make something that is supposed to come out steaming hot raw. Well the manager offered to switch out the food and comp the meal but I asked for the district managers name and number to really settle this once and for all. I'll give it 2 stars since I ate there once before and the food was good",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wyomissing?start=20,,,,,
19,Eric P.,"Reading, PA",1,59,1.0,2.0,2015-01-04,"It's a Chili's, if you've been to one you've pretty much been to them all. The service here is good, but besides that the food and drinks are woefully bland, better to find someplace else than here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wyomissing,,,,,
5,Mike F.,"Reading, PA",86,146,351.0,3.0,2015-01-10,"You know, I'll always have a warm spot in my heart for this place. This Chili's was, after all, one of my first employers. That was 12 years ago, when I was a 17-year-old busboy, right around the time of this location's grand opening.  I was a little disappointed on my last trip, having discovered the mushroom, onion, and Swiss burger had been removed from the menu. It has always been one of my all time favorites (I ate LOTS of them after my shifts in my bussing days). Oh, and the broccoli cheese soup was gone, too. What the heck! The service here is above average. Maybe I'm being biased, because even after all these years, there are some familiar faces still working here. The employees are as dedicated as they come. As for the food - well, the cooks are pretty good with the meat temperatures. My buddy ordered a burger done medium, and it was darn near perfect.  Other than the steaks and burgers, I'd shy away from most everything else. I can't fault the cooks, but the chicken and appetizers are pre-cooked and simply reheated in a pan, broiler, or microwave. That's just the way these types of places operate. The pasta is even pre-cooked, so when it's reheated before the meal, it tends to come out sticky and gummy - all sense of texture is lost.  I must say, though, the nachos will always be a guilty pleasure of mine! I don't care how they're prepared - I love 'em!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wyomissing,,,,,
18,Jessica P.,"Sinking Spring, PA",0,25,15.0,1.0,2015-10-09,"What a waste!  Wish I could give ZERO stars!!! Wanted to grab a quick bite to eat. Wished we would have chosen somewhere else. Where to start?!? We had to wait to be seated until the hostess cleared off a table in the bar because apparently there weren't any other seats available. It was 6p on a Thursday night and the restaurant was practically empty!   We waited so long, we were ready to walk out when finally we were asked if we wanted something to drink. I ordered a Berry Margarita. It was NASTY!  Too much sour mix. Didn't taste the berry at all. And not to mention it was WAY overpriced.  We both ordered the pick 2 and 3. My husband was asked if he wanted sour cream and I asked for extra sour cream. When our food FINALLY arrived, my husband had NO sour cream and I had one teaspoon. We wanted to ask for more but no one was around. Our server was socializing with apparent ""regulars"".   The food was sub par and that's being polite. The taco fell apart. The avocado was mushy and brown. The plates were scalding hot which usually means they were sitting for a long time. That was confirmed with the crust on the beans.  After eating what we could, we paid our bill ourselves using he touch pad thingy and left.  By that night, we were both fighting over the bathroom!   NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!! This place should be shut down",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wyomissing,,,,,
11,Keith B.,"Schuylkill Haven, PA",0,7,,2.0,2015-11-16,"My wife and I went to Chili's because we had received a promotional gift card. One part of the restaurant experience that I often find frustrating is the person at the hostess station. You are not planning the D-day invasion, it's just a table. So in a restaurant with MANY open tables I'm asked to sit and wait. I have had similar experiences at Olive Garden and have simply turned and walked out. In this case I wanted to use the gift card so I waited.  Message to the manager: Maybe you're understaffed. Maybe you are concerned about which server should get the next table. These things are not my problem.  Message to the servers: My experience starts as soon as I walk in the door. The generosity of the tip is changing right from the start.  My wife asked to speak to the manager. He was able to seat us immediately. (Again there were plenty of open tables).  So we had our lunch. The food was good. The waitress was good. But you know what I remember most? The inability to do the basic task of getting customers seated.  The star rating really just doesn't work here. I certainly can't say 3 (A-OK) and saying 2 puts too much weight on the table issue that in the end the manager did take care of. But I will still have to go with two stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wyomissing,,,,,
9,George B.,"Reading, PA",17,62,2.0,2.0,2016-03-06,"Slow slow service, over cooked steak and appetizer arrived after our meal. Overall a mediocre experience and not a place I will likely put on my top 10 list.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wyomissing,,,,,
10,Rachael R.,"Reading, PA",1,54,16.0,5.0,2016-03-19,"I hadn't been here in years and we stopped back randomly. The whole menu is different and MUCH fresher. We sat at the bar and the bartenders John and Andrew were a blast and knew how to connect with the whole crowd. Great service, surprisingly great food and I can't wait to go back. I never thought I'd say about a Chilis.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wyomissing,,,,,
8,Kelsie U.,"Fleetwood, PA",136,18,21.0,2.0,2016-04-01,"Hadn't been to chilis for over a year, due to bad service and food in the past, but I decided to give it another try.... Let me tell you, DO NOT GIVE IT A SECOND CHANCE. You would be better off going to moes, or maybe even McDonald's.  The food was mediocre, overpriced, and luckily since I had a view of them preparing it in the kitchen, I can even say it was touched by the employees bare hands. I even saw fries get dropped all over the counter and thrown back into the bin to be served later. The chips were a soggy and greasy disappointment. They are free at on the border and much much better.  The tables were falling off of the walls and touching my knees... The only things good about this experience were the waiter and my drink which was the tropical sunrise margarita, which is the only way I got through my meal.  I will not be returning any time soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wyomissing,,,,,
6,C K.,"Reading, PA",0,58,11.0,2.0,2016-11-14,"They need to put this place out of it's misery. Every time I have dined here something gets messed up.  My kids wanted  to stop and i said OK we'll give it a try again. Waitress was ready nice and was great at keeping the sodas and waters refilled. The the kitchen ""staff"" should be sent to RACC for reading skills assessments. My son ordered a burger and both of us said just roll burger and cheese, nothing else, the waitress goes OK no this no that etc, etc. and wrote it down. I ordered a chicken salad and said no tomatoes, and again she goes OK no tomatoes and writes it down. My sons burger arrived and after seeing the look on his face I knew something was amiss, we found that pickles and ""special sauce"" were under the patty, I got up and took the burger back to a waitress and than sat down to eat my salad. Well low and behold looking at the salad I noticed that the kitchen had put tomatoes on the order and realized that they messed up the order, and tried to pick off most of the tomatoes. At that point I sent the salad back. Manager arrived shortly afterwards, which seemed to be a regular thing here and comped the burger and salad.  Sad part about it is for 2 draft diet Cokes and 2 bottled root beers, a small loaded french fries  app. and my girls steak dinner the bill was almost $40.00",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wyomissing,,,,,
7,Michael Q.,"Wyomissing, PA",74,19,24.0,2.0,2016-12-10,"False advertisement!  ""3 for me for $10"" is not advertized accurately.  Look at the card on the table, the skillet they actually bring you is not even half as big as the one pictured.  Worse than that was there was barely any meat at all!  All onions and bell peppers is all I got with just 2 ounces of meat at the most.  Waitress was hot however.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wyomissing,,,,,
0,Joey F.,"Hilton Head Island, SC",169,11,,3.0,2017-01-29,"This gets the 3rd star because of how much I used to like Chili's. It gets the second because the staff here is just awesome, never have I had a reason to complain about customer service. Sadly all of the changes that they're going through I'd assume at the corporate level has made the food obvious they're trying to hard.  I'd love if they went back to their roots and brought back the easy to enjoy place it used to be.  Again if you're going out for drinks the service and bartenders are so nice and fun.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wyomissing,,,,,
3,Kimberly S.,"Mohnton, PA",16,27,14.0,2.0,2017-04-08,"This is my second chance I gave this restaurant recently. And for the second time I asked for extra lettuce, extra cheese and some sour cream. And again not right. No lettuce and a sprinkle of cheese. Got a little more but still had to ask for more. My husbands steak was supposed to be medium and it was well done but it was tender so we didn't need to send it back . Uggghh I do wanted it to be different this time. The waitress was nice though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wyomissing,,,,,
4,Nathaniel D.,"Schwenksville, PA",1,68,,3.0,2017-05-06,"I only visited this restaurant once. I have been to many Chili's locations. I went to this Chili's on my way to a concert for a late lunch.

I ate around 7:30am by the time I was done doing all my work for the day my fiancé wanted meet me over there aroun 4 we sat down( I didn't eat since morning) we ordered drinks then food. Drinks came quick but the food took at least 45mins for 3 tacos and a black bean burger my tacos were literally cold. Only thing that was hot were fries the bun on the vegetarian burger must've been near hamburger grease all my fiancé tasted was hamburger. The waiter was nice but only took our order then didn't see him for an hour! Will never go back save your money! Came back for another chance figuring it was a fluke, was mortified when I order the quesadilla THAT CANT BE CHICKEN INSIDE THERE! My wife got nice piece grilled chicken breast I had some weird old pale looking fake chicken it didn't look like chicken I showed the manager they took off the bill she offered to make another for me with different chicken. ( she says they cook it in advance) this chicken looked boiled or something It wasblike rubber ORDER CHICKEN QUESADILLA SEE WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT I DARE YOU!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-wyomissing,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32
