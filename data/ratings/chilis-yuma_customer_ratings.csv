I Decided to get the ""Memphis Dry Rub"" ribs for a meal, nothing to write home about but nothing terrible, just decent quick bite to eat.  I left feeling pretty full, overall I was happy with the meal.  I've always been a fan of Chili's and this one wasn't anything out of the ordinary.

Chili's is probably one of my top favorite places to eat!! The CLASSIC NACHOS are sooooo good and the burgers they make are by far the best ones I had in Yuma. The prices are okay and the staff is typically very friendly, even though they sometimes just stand at the bar texting with their phones!! Not so nice to see as a customer if you're waiting for your drink. The drinks are just awesome and I can't complain about the prices on them!!!  Overall - love it!!! I'd given 5* but the staff should definitely work on their attention for the guests even though it's not busy as hell!!

The expo ticket was still on the tray and the ranch had tomato and avocado in it that had probably dropped in there and not been pulled out. When he dropped it the ranch spilled all over the lettuce. I then ordered the southwest smokehouse burger and went for the turkey patty option. I asked Dee, my server, if this had mayo on it because I absolutely cannot stand mayo. She said ""No sir just the BBQ sauce"" perfect. Much to my surprise, my burger comes out with about 2 tablespoons of mayo on it!!! I brought it to her attention and she said she would go get me a new bottom bun. She came back a moment later with a bottom bun and a wilted piece of lettuce. I asked about the pickles and tomatoes and all the other stuff that came on the burger and she went back try again. She returned the final time with the bottom bun setup in a bag and to go box.

I have dined at this Chili's once to twice a week over the last two weeks during our YUMA season. My food is luke warm at best. Yes, I have brought this to the manager's attention. Consistently our food is luke warm. Never hot. The menu has changed over the years and what they did best: chili tacos and burgers they have moved away from to compete with Tex Mex. Down the street is a little place that never serves luke warm food and in my opinion would give the Cheese Cake Factory's burgers a run for their money.  We will dine at Eddies until Chili's address the temperature of their food.

Stopping on our way home to San Diego, from Colorado, last Saturday, we took a chance on Chili's. Glad we did.  I ordered the club that came with turkey, deliciously cooked bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, and avocado on lightly toasted wheat bread.  It was neat, it was proportional, it was done right and it was delicious.  The fries served with it were delicious too, hot, fresh, and crispy.  I was not sharing.  Perfection would have included a spear of crunchy dill pickle. My husband got the smothered smoked chicken burrito that was huge and delicious.  Rice and beans that came with it good too.  He could not finish the whole thing and if we had refridgeration, we would have taken it with us. One daughter ordered the cajun chicken penne pasta and everyone really liked it, her included. One daughter ordered the chicken enchilada with sour cream sauce and that was really tasty too.  Personally, I really liked it too. Youngest ordered mac n cheese kid meal.  She went nuts over the ""just like home"" mac n cheese.  (I think she was talking about the blue box we sometimes make).  It was creamy, not dry and it was really a good sized portion. Lastly, the girls ordered the brownie dessert with ice cream on top, topped with toffee. Had a taste, delicious.  Not a bit left. Service was good.  Bathrooms and table were clean.  Food was really, really good. I hope they have the same menu here in San Diego.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yuma,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32
10,Haley B.,"Yuma, AZ",2,2,,2.0,2016-09-20,"Worst customer ever.  Took a good 10 minutes before someone even noticed that my family came to the front to be seated. Employees walked by but no one mad it apparent that we were waiting or needed help. Then towards the end of our dinner the waitress disappeared and we waited for awhile on someone to come deliver the dessert or to ask if we needed anything else. The first part of dinner was great and the waitress made her appearance a lot but after we got our food , it took atleast 30 minutes for her to even make an appearance again.  Also very cold and the dessert also came out cold when it was supposed to be warm.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yuma,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36
13,Kerri W.,"Scottsdale, AZ",39,27,49.0,2.0,2017-01-08,I'm so done with Chili's. I used to love this chain - when the food was good. I don't know what happened (change of ownership? New management?) but I just gave it its last chance. The only reason this review is getting 2 stars is because the server was awesome. Sad :(,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yuma,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28

12,Wendi A.,"Yuma, AZ",0,10,28.0,1.0,2017-02-19,"Probably the worse experience I've had in a while, after sitting for 30 mins, we had to go ask to be taken our order since there was no waiter around thAt cared enough to take our order. We got no forks, no napkins no straws, we were lucky enough to get our drinks at this point. The waiter was so careless, like his laid back attitude was nice at first until it started affecting the way or lie service was, we got appetizer and it was okay after we had to ask and wait for every single thing whenever he would come around like can I give us napkins, even the straws we had to to get them ourselves at the bar,  when our food came in , it was just bad ..... my Nieces burger was not cooked and my chicken strips were over cooked and dry and nasty , when my niece told the server about her burger he didn't say anything and just left, the manager came to say well the meat is never frozen so you can even eat rare and you would be okay .. as if that was the point. In overall this was bad , if I could choose 0 stars I would, this won't be in my places to go in a very long while .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yuma,2.2,2.2,2.2,,2.2
9,Kerri M.,"Yuma, AZ",0,10,2.0,3.0,2017-05-08,Went with family for lunch when they opened at 11:00 on a Sunday. Not terribly busy. The waitress was nice. I ordered the prime rib steak tacos with corn tortillas. I should have asked if the tacos came fried! Most horrible taco I have ever had. The rice and beans were cold as was the greasy hard taco. I guess they were waiting on my husbands fajitas before they brought the rest of the food out for our party of 6. I have never had any issues with the food here but this is as the worst. I will say the watermelon margarita was awesome,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yuma,2.2,2.2,2.2,,2.2
4,Shameka P.,"Yuma, AZ",9,20,54.0,5.0,2017-06-30,"Went out for a birthday dinner for me and my mom and it was amazing! I had the new Crispy Fiery Pepper Crispers and the new Coconut State Of Mind drink. Be prepared for the hot goodness that will enter your mouth. Just as a warning the heat delivers, but there is a hint of sweet in the sauce. The Coconut State of Mind was also great drink, I went light on the alcohol, so it would probably be better with the normal amount of alcohol. The service was great our waiter Casey was great, super chill dude, he made sure that are meal was okay and checked up on us regularly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yuma,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24
5,Philip M.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,18,,1.0,2017-08-03,"I came to Chilis after a hard day's work, expecting Danielle, who I have seen before on Thursday nights.  She wasn't there and I should have walked out.  A young lady who couldn't muster a smile asked me for a drink first and I requested a martini.  She made it perfect but alas was at the end of her shift.  Enter the stoner... Her replacement was some stoner with the obligatory arm tattoos and a baseball cap.    He looked at my martini and admitted he couldn't make one if I wanted another.  (strike one!).  He took my dinner order and I told him what I wanted but because he had the memory of a gnat, I had to repeat myself which I did all day on my job and don't expect to do it again for a casual dinner.(strike two!).  The dinner came and sure enough he got one of the sides wrong (strike three!!! You're out).  When he asked if I wanted another martini I was afraid of what I'd get. I spoke to the manager who offered to comp everything and I refused.  I am not looking for freebees.  I would like to go out after an aggravating day and chill out.  I used to live in Las Vegas and the bartenders/waiters can take an entire order without writing it down.   Shouldn't we elevate our expectations to other wait staff in other cities?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-yuma,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24
