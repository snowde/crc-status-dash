31,Jason R.,"Tampa, FL",34,21,2.0,3.0,2012-05-07,"It's standard Chili's.  Service was ok...  They were a little busy, it was the dinner rush, but I would have hoped for better service.  A for effort I suppose.  Not too many Gluten Free options here though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-zephyrhills?start=20,2.316,2.316,2.316,2.316,2.316
30,H K.,"Ontario, CA",0,83,1.0,5.0,2013-01-05,We got the $6. Lunch combo.  I got this awesome chicken enchilada soup with a large half sandwich.  Hubby got chilli with a large BLT.  Very filling.  Alisa was a great server.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-zephyrhills?start=20,2.452,2.452,2.452,2.452,2.452
13,Stephanie D.,"Zephyrhills, FL",33,37,87.0,3.0,2013-06-29,"Chili's. There's a sign that says 'Like No Place Else' but that's kind of the opposite of true. I thought about giving two stars but Chili's scored one extra for adding Mango-Chile Tilapia and Mango-Chile Chicken to their 2 for $20 menu. Normally I'm stuck with the Cajun Chicken Pasta which comes with enough cholesterol for two people and zero vegetables. I was pleased with the new choices (including the new flat breads) but don't really understand where they're going with the pizzas. This ain't Papa Johns. To the suprise of no one we ordered chips and salsa as our appetizer. Then Mango-Chile Tilapia and Margherita-Lime Chicken for our entrees. My husband enjoyed his Chicken and my Tilapia was surprisingly tasty, covered in mangos, pico de gallo and avocado with mango-chile sauce. It was just the right amount of flaky, sweet, spicy and salty for me. I was bummed though because the dish was served on a rectangle plate with my sweet potato fries in the middle so I couldn't mix my fish and rice easily.  Also the fries were extra salty and overdone. I do love some sweet potato fries though so I ate them anyway. Obviously I'm a food snob.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-zephyrhills,2.1879999999999997,2.1879999999999997,2.1879999999999997,2.1879999999999997,2.1879999999999997
28,Tom G.,"Brooksville, FL",21,3,1.0,1.0,2014-02-26,Very poor service. We had a large party and ended up being there three hours. Several meals had to be sent back.steaks overcooked. Very disappointing.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-zephyrhills?start=20,1.924,1.924,1.924,1.924,1.9240000000000002
22,Jodi Watson K.,"Dade City, FL",1,9,32.0,3.0,2014-02-28,"Not bad for a chain restaurant, they were very busy but we were seated quickly. Our server was very helpful and fun!

29,Paul P.,"Dade City, FL",0,16,7.0,4.0,2014-07-16,My wife and I decided to try Chili's again after a long absence. We were pleasantly surprised. The service was fast and helpful.

24,Joe C.,"Lexington, KY",2,7,15.0,1.0,2014-08-26,Worst Chili's I've seen. Dirty tables. Strange odor. Terrible service and food. Wow. Surprisingly bad. Bad management obviously. Don't eat here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-zephyrhills?start=20,2.02,2.02,2.02,2.02,2.02
14,Debra P.,"Tampa, FL",16,31,82.0,4.0,2014-11-22,"Food is what you expect.   Service was very good, friendly and attentive.  I haven't eaten at a Chili's for well over a year.  The menu/seems to be larger than I remember but I opted for a standard app plate with potato skins,  chicken crispers and onion rings. It was a lot of food with 3 pieces of each, I only ate 2 of each.  Tried the featured tequila drink, some tequila ""remarketed"" or something like that by Justin Timberlake.   It was fine but at $9 it's higher than most of the margaritas on the menu.  I'm giving Chili's an extra star here for adding the Zoisk system at the table.   I can see some of the features of it being useful but the ability to pay at the table and not have the server take my credit card away from me is a big deal.  I thank Chili's for being proactive here and hope to see more restaurants follow suit quickly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-zephyrhills,2.448,2.448,2.448,2.448,2.4480000000000004
27,Kurtis B.,"Zephyrhills, FL",3,11,,2.0,2014-12-29,"This Chili's is hit or miss. i've been here about 5 times in the past 2 years, and was disappointed twice. The worst thing was the Guacamole that they had. It was extremely bland and boring. They make some really good burgers and fries, but I would go elsewhere for anything else on their menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-zephyrhills?start=20,,,,,
26,Justin A.,"Zephyrhills, FL",0,1,,1.0,2015-02-15,We tried to eat here at 1:30 on a Sunday. We were seated quickly in a booth but after that no one spoke to us for 25 minutes. Meanwhile each adjacent table was serviced  at least once and the Manager on duty walked by on at least 3 occasions.  After nearly half an hour with no one as much as taking our drink orders we left.  I've never experienced this before in my life and was very disappointed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-zephyrhills?start=20,,,,,
25,Bridgette M.,"East Bernstadt, KY",0,4,,5.0,2015-02-18,"This was our first visit here. I got the chicken quesadillo's with black beans and rice. The food was excellent. Spicy, but just right.

18,Justin D.,"Miami, FL",242,91,73.0,4.0,2015-03-29,"Four stars for a chili's per standard chili's ratings go. Wasn't the best I've been too, but definitely not the worst. Service was adequate. Baby crying behind us was annoying but what should I expect for a ""Chili's"". The 3 of us enjoyed our meal and the well margaritas are BOGOF. I'd eat here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-zephyrhills,,,,,
21,Sarita T.,"Kissimmee, Orlando, FL",1,13,,5.0,2015-04-29,"Had a great time last night with family enjoyed a late dinner. I have to say that our waitress Amanda was very sweet, friendly and attentive. Our food was delicious we had onion rings and crispy cheddar bites appetizers loved it.For dinner Chipotle Fresh Mex Bowl, it was delicious.

15,Jon P.,"Zephyrhills, FL",1,11,,1.0,2015-08-23,"Ordered online at 9 pm tonight. Order was to be ready @ 9:43. 50+ dollar order. We got there almost exactly @ 9:45. Nothing but one item was ready. It sat on a counter while they tried to figure it out. They never did, 30 minutes later we gave up and left. Staff completely clueless, wandering aimlessly, restaurant was not busy, nearly empty. Gentleman that came in after us to pick up was given his food immediately and if he hadn't mentioned that they had not charged him would have gotten it for free. If it were not so late now and we were not so hungry this would be damn near comical. I've seen better execution at Hardee's. If you can't effectively deliver online ordering and pick up, don't offer the service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-zephyrhills,,,,,
12,Jessica P.,"Dade City, FL",0,11,1.0,1.0,2015-11-02,"We used to come here very often as it was close to home but the last couple of times we were there the waitress, which happened to be the same one, was very unprofessional & rude. The first trip was my birthday, she pretty much threw everything on our table. My husband asked if we had done something to upset her she no but that she was exhausted because she worked a double & shouldn't be there right then, we asked for our food to go since we hadn't received it yet, she didn't respond then 15 minutes later brought all out food out, not in boxes. She brought boxes for us to do it ourselves, said she didn't have time to do it. We both got fajitas which has about 10 little condiments each, she threw little cups for us to put them in.  The last & final time we will go there my 14 year daughter started feeling sick to her stomach, we asked politely if we could please get our food to go due to our daughter not feeling well, she still brought it out with boxes for us to do ourselves. My husband at this point was furious & asked for a manager she refused and said she would get it in to go boxes. She took the food back yelling through the dining area that her table demanded it out in boxes. She was very rude & it was uncalled for. We will never return again!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-zephyrhills,,,,,
20,Mallory B.,"Dade City, FL",104,6,15.0,1.0,2015-11-27,"Where do I begin? Customer service must not be of value to the management or staff at Chilis. We ordered an appetizer, one happy hour beer, water, and two entrees. Before we could even finish our appetizer we had no drinks and no one came back and checked on us. Karley was waitress and the service was below par we saw her for getting our order and bringing our entrees that's it besides her walking past us seven times without checking on how we are doing. She never checked on us or offered to get us dessert or more drinks. Instead without us asking she gave us our check and told us to pay when we were ready. We asked for another beer and she gave us our ticket again and asked us if we needed boxes to go mind you at this time we had only the crust of a quesadilla on our plates.  I previously was a waitress myself and she completely lacked any personality and honestly was very rude. She sat our drinks at the end of the table out of our reach and left without asking us if we needed anything else. Next time we will drive out of our way to the new chilis in the next town for better service!!! As previously being a waitress I know hardship of bad tips and busy nights, however, I would not have gone so far as to hurry out my customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-zephyrhills?start=20,,,,,
19,Megan M.,"Dade City, FL",0,15,,5.0,2015-12-13,Ordered the avocado sirloin med rare.  It was good and cooked perfectly.  Also tried the loaded boneless wings.  They were delicious.  Missy the bartender took very good care of me.  I come here aften and never have a bad experience!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-zephyrhills,,,,,
16,Diana L.,"Dade City, FL",49,26,,2.0,2016-01-22,The only reason I go to this chilis it's because of Jamie the waitress she makes it worth going in otherwise the restaurant is dirty the presentation of the food is sloppy and most of the other staff members just don't give a damn.

23,Yousa G.,"Zephyrhills, FL",1,8,1.0,1.0,2016-02-22,"To be fair, it was a very busy night. Now here comes the ""however"". Arrived and wanted outdoor seating as I smoke. Tables AND floor littered everywhere. Tables stacked with dishes from previous patrons but have no way to identify length of time between them and us. Asked for our table to be wiped clean. Male worker does so - but leaves food debris on table. (Really? You can't wipe a damn table? More interested in the ladies sitting next to us I think.) So we get the utensils provided. NO SPOONS for either myself or my wife. So you use a knife or fork to stir coffee. Dinner arrives. Wife generally happy with her fare. Mine, not so much. Had 6 oz steak with tomatoes and asparagus, fries. Tomatoes ok for being baked with steak. Steak near perfection - and that was the highlight of the dish. Asparagus was apparently canned variety and cheap at that. Mushy with stringy, woody highlights (Sort of like interior of a tree.) Came time to leave and we needed to just pay the bill and go. Had somewhere else to go before they closed in 30 minutes. Told waitress we were ready to pay bill. She disappears. Can't wait. We already have the bill - just need to pay it. So we take it to the receptionist area and no one to be found. Ask a random waitress if we can check out. Says she'll find our waitress. Clocks running now. Bad Table Wiper says we can pay at the table with some little electronic gizmo. We told him none of the tables outside had such a device. Muddled checkout process. Wife finally got a manager to whom she pointed out some severed credit card checkout problems. Finally got bill paid. CAVEAT: I am not in the food sales business. But customer service IS customer service. Clean is CLEAN. Have no reason or desire to return to this business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-zephyrhills?start=20,,,,,

6,Janet B.,"Ellijay, GA",5,165,28.0,4.0,2016-06-06,Sorry folks but I've never had a problem n go often.

7,Jonpaul I.,"Zephyrhills, FL",0,12,,1.0,2016-07-30,"Came to sit at the bar and order a drink/food and watched the local brain dead morons get over served.......... Meanwhile, kids are sitting within earshot right behind some A hole at the bar with their family watching some drunken redneck grab ass and curse at women. Pretty sure I saw one guy stumble out and get into his car and another kept spitting on the floor and KEPT getting served. ..... Terrible servers, they act like you're inconveniencing them, manager is from Greece or some sh!t and barely speaks English, food next to me looked like fried rubber bands, guy eating it kept turning to me and eating with his mouth open and laughing food all over me, the one decent waitress is a loud mouth b!tch that screams when she confirms your order and talks sh!t about the other lazy staff, the menus are deep fried and stick to you as you turn the page, etc... Ruby Tuesdays is right down the road, just go there. FYI I went to the men's room, urinal had a turd in it..........no joke....... so I waited outside the handicapped stall, someone was in there grunting away, after 10 minutes of this I backed up and leaned over a bit and saw 2 shoes spread apart and a pair of legs kneeled in front of them, both sets of legs were wearing mens shoes..........Fuuuuuuuuuuuggggggg that, immediately left, didn't even go back to see if my fried goat was ready and waiting, jumped in the truck and almost ran over a family of black people making my escape.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-zephyrhills,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
11,Sash A.,"Katy, TX",9,5,1.0,1.0,2016-12-30,"The staff was friendly, but the food leaves much to be desired. It took over 15 mins to get a house salad out, which is forgiveable since they were so busy, but the tomatoes were hot, and the salad tasted funny. When the actual meal came, it was cold, and proportions nothing like the pictures. To top it off, we were over charged 5 dollars without reason and we didn't notice until leaving- the price for 3 for me for 10 is NOT what it says, on top of the fee for the full platter (and extra 2 for sour cream) there was an extra fee of 5 for it that is not explained at all. As if our Putin wasn't enough, my husband and I both got sick off of the food. The next day, I had some of the cake (I took it home with me) and it also made me sick!!! I don't know what's going on in that kitchen, but don't go to this location unless you want to spend the night with food poisoning.

The service wasn't bad but it wasn't the best. Some very friendly people though.  I'm not really a big fan of these restaurants and this one still didn't change my opinion on them.

3,Staci B.,"Tampa, FL",0,12,6.0,4.0,2017-03-08,"This chilis location is great! Very quick service. I came at 12:00 expecting to see a large lunch crowd but was seated right away. The server was very attentive with my drink and brought me a new one every time I was getting low. I never had to ask for a refill. The bottomless chips and queso are delicious, and I like that they bring more with no extra charge. About a month ago, they had a $10.00 fajita lunch special that came with an appetizer and the molten chocolate cake for dessert. They have since stopped that lunch promotion. It was a great value and I'm disappointed it is no longer offered. Overall, my experience at this chilis location was better than others.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-zephyrhills,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
