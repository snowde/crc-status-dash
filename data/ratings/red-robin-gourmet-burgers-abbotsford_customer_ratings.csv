3,Jennifer S.,"Phoenix, AZ",309,541,1177.0,3.0,2015-04-07,Red Robin's is your classic burger joint and great for families.  The chicken BBQ whisky burger was good but their prime rib burger was not worth $17.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-abbotsford,,,,,
9,Taylor S.,"Richmond, Canada",0,6,,1.0,2015-11-14,Don't use your credit card here! They overcharged my credit card $15 more than what my bill was. I consider that stealing...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-abbotsford,,,,,

7,Branden H.,"Chilliwack, Canada",0,29,1.0,1.0,2016-06-06,45 min wait..only to find out our server forgot to place our order. He blamed it on the fact that he was training a new girl...isn't placing the order the next step after taking the order? The food was terrible as was not what we ordered when we questioned it we were just told yes they did not even confirm with the kitchen. 1.5 hours spent in the restaurant 50 bucks spent and we left hungry. Not a good experience. Also there are no vegan children's options on the kids menu. Not gluten free friendly either. Air conditioning was nice and the kid got a free balloon.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-abbotsford,,,,,
5,Leslie L.,"Burnaby, Canada",1,4,,2.0,2016-06-27,"The food is great but that of course is not why I am writing this review. I have found with red robins above and below the border they are EXTREMELY hit and miss with their service - it's either fantastic or the biggest shit show you've ever seen. This location in Abbotsford is no different. We were on our way home and decided to stop here instead of a location closer to home. Upon arrival I was told it would be a 20-25 min wait even though I offered for us to sit in the bar (every other red robin I have ever been to allows you to seat yourselves in the bar for food and beverage service). So we wait and while waiting another couple arrives and ask the same thing. They then proceed to seat themselves even being told they would not be able to. The restaurant did allow them to so I commented to the hostess Haylee and she apologized. She then proceeded to tell the assistant manager who came over and apologized and took our order after we had been seated (in the bar of course). Great to acknowledge the mistake as I am a firm believer in if you make a rule you need to stick with it. Not let it bend depending on the customer. From being seated to finishing our meal we only had one interaction with the guy who was supposedly our waiter, he brought us our drinks - incorrectly made of course. The hostess Haylee had to bring us napkins and not once were we asked if our food was alright. It was difficult to even see a waiter or waitress let alone make eye contact to get any sort of service from anyone. Thankful I don't live in Abby, I won't be back that's for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-abbotsford,,,,,
0,Lyndon U.,"Highway 11, Abbotsford, Canada",89,7,,5.0,2017-02-14,"It's Red Robin.  If you haven't, you should. The menu is broad, the prices are all right, and the staff is generally fantastic.  I've never had a bad experience here (after 50+ visits), and the food is always delicious...and free fry refills. If you're looking for a decent environment with tasty food that will be somewhere between $15-20 per person (depending of course on your drinking habits), it's great. Great wraps, burgers, pasta, appetizers, etc. What's more is that they have a frequent eater program where every 10th entree is free.  It's awesome to go in every now and then and get a $4 bill rather than a $20 one! And I'd definitely recommend a Mushroom Burger, Whole Wheat Bun, with an extra pattie. It's absolutely delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-abbotsford,,,,,
2,Cheryl C.,"Abbotsford, Canada",38,4,,5.0,2017-05-30,"No wait on a Friday night around 8pm. Got a comfy booth. Food was excellent, as always. I love the free second serving of fries/yam fries you can get with your meal and the seasoning salt to bring them some extra flavour.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-abbotsford,,,,,
1,Josh W.,"Warrenville, IL",5,10,7.0,1.0,2017-11-17,"The manager clearly needs training. Your failing your staff. Help, prioritize, direct, steer the god dam ship. Appetizers cold dinner was cold... portions lacking hugely. Bottomless fries and salad but literally 6-10 fries per plate or 7 pieces of lettuce WTF LOL.  When you have a reservation table of 15 you have a designated server. Dumb ass.  Not anyone's fault but the managers. We tipped the waitress great we thanked her.  No one knew our dissatisfaction as the manager was preoccupied pretending he was busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-abbotsford,,,,,
