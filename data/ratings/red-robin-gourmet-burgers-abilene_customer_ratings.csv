32,Sarah M.,"Fort Meade, MD",64,102,14.0,5.0,2012-01-08,"Stopped by today after we came into town for a little shopping and we were very impressed! Our server (Amanda I think) was very attentive and efficient, she was friendly and clearly has a ton of knowledge about her company! We noticed that as she walked by the tables she looked at our glasses first and also checked on us, then she'd come back down the aisle with tea and water, or would bring a new drink for my husband. We were very pleased to have had her as our sever!!  The timing was amazing, I couldn't believe how quickly they ha our dinner out. Also since my hubby and I were splitting a wrap and a salad, she had then put everything onto two plates for us! Great!! The food at RR is so consistent, no matter where we have eaten it. We love it and love that we can rely on the consistency of the menu and flavors. When we go to Abilene again we will absolutely go back!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-abilene?start=20,3.124,3.124,3.124,3.124,3.124
29,J A.,"Abilene, TX",4,21,15.0,1.0,2012-02-04,Had to send my burger back twice for being overcooked - my wife was much nicer and just ate hers well-done (though she ordered Med-rare) Second time looked promising - moist and juicy on the outside.  So took a peak inside to see grey meat.  Either old beef and properly cooked or it was well done again.   Don't offer the option of choosing your temperature if you cannot execute it!  So much for dinner.......,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-abilene?start=20,2.5960000000000005,2.5960000000000005,2.5960000000000005,2.5960000000000005,2.5960000000000005

My family and I had the opportunity to eat at their restaurant for dinner last night and what a great experience it was. The atmosphere,food, service  and prices are just right.

I had heard rumors that they had to hire a lot of new staff and some that had tried it immediately after the reopen weren't impressed.  We were promptly greeted, seated and had our drink orders taken. Both my friend and I got draft Fat Tires, but were given no coasters. The waitress had them in her back pocket, so I'm glad we *didn't* get them (mmmm, butt sweat).  I don't eat meat, so I ordered the BLTA croissant without the back and turkey. For once, the order taker didn't freak out because of my order AND it was correctly made! Our food arrived quickly and was good, but I was sad to see that they no longer serve cantaloupe slices along with the fries and sandwich.  I would love to give four stars, but after we got our food, we were never checked in on, besides the one time the gal behind the bar hollered at us to see if we needed anything else (at this point, we had been done for awhile). This normally would have been fine with me, but we saw a group of servers sitting/standing around chatting. They could take a hint from one of the busboys who politely asked if he could take away our empty dishes (and every time I saw him he was doing the same to other tables).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-abilene?start=20,2.8920000000000003,2.8920000000000003,2.8920000000000003,2.8920000000000003,2.892000000000001
