68,Briana S.,"Seattle, WA",26,160,5.0,2.0,2012-05-10,I love Red Robin but this location was probably one of the worst I have been to.  The service was slow and they let all the dirty dishes on the table accumulate before even starting to clear one.  The burger wasn't as good as it usually is at other locations and I think I would stop at any Red Robin other than this one after this experience.  Seemed like the hoppin' place for Albany though.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-albany?start=40,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003

I order some clam strips, they were different from any of the other Red Robin's I have ever been too, they were lightly breaded, bland, gristly, stringy, and super chewy. The shrimp I received as a replacement for the clam strips, were not much different. Breaded shrimp should have bread, and not a  hard, dried out almost non existent crust. Also the cocktail sauce, I believe was red colored apple sauce, it  had the same taste,  and the same  consistency and texture, also you could taste the cinnamon. The waitress and the manager, were both very friendly, however I do not hold out much hope for he rest of the food at this location. So after this experience we ended up at the Del Taco just across the street, and had a pretty decent dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-albany?start=20,2.8880000000000003,2.8880000000000003,2.8880000000000003,2.8880000000000003,2.888000000000001

In fact, I think their business model is rather unique. So I had a BBQ chicken wrap and sweet potato fries which were an extra charge as an upgrade from the regular fries and they were all you can eat. I ate too many . Anyhow, our server was nice and I give it four stars for hitting the marks based on the type of joint that it is.

38,Melodie G.,"Portland, OR",94,16,18.0,3.0,2014-06-21,"I have come to this location for a few years now and have always had exceptional service and great food. We had a few waitresses and bartenders that we loved and would request for often because they had such great customer service. A lot of the girls personalized sparkly name tags which made it feel like less of a corporate chain restaurant. The last few months however something has changed. Customer service has gone out the window...when you cross your fingers you don't get seated with the waitress you really don't like, there's a problem. There aren't many familiar faces with sparkly name tags. (Did the good ones leave?) The food presentation is not like it used to be either. I know your food doesn't end up looking like the picture, but the burgers here used to look that good! Now, not so much. I've gotten a burger that was about a flat as a pancake when all i asked for was no tomatoes.  We will occasionally come back just hoping that's it's as good as it used to be, but we end up leaving being disappointed again.

15,James M.,"Salem, OR",2,233,991.0,4.0,2014-08-03,"Four of us met for lunch at Red Robin in Albany, and although it was a relief to get into the air-conditioned coolness of the restaurant, we were met by the howls and screams of children being children, and really enjoying themselves.  To the point that normal conversation was nearly impossible.  Which is my only real beef with Red Robin wherever I go ... always bleeding noisy.  But, this is what happens when you come to Red Robin. We usually eat in the bar, but not today, today, Britianni seated us at Children Ground Zero, passed out menus, and brought us drinks. We shared a large Towering Onion Rings (13 rings, $9.00), and we really enjoy the Campfire dipping sauce.  I ordered the Prime Chophouse Burger (medium patty with horseradish, dijon mustard, mushrooms, steak sauce, Provolone cheese and onion straws, on an onion roll / $10.79), and I subbed Mac & Cheese for the Bottomless Plank Fries (for an additional $1.49), but it was good to have something different.  I did notice the pasta is Cavatappi, not Macaroni, but it is still cheesy goodness. Our server, Kandace, did a great job, attentive without hovering.  Four Stars. FYI -- I recommend that each member of the family join Red Robin's loyalty program, which is called Red Robin Royalty.  It gives you a free burger during the month of your birthday (they deduct the least expensive item on the check -- which is still ten-bucks plus!), every tenth item free (you can mix and match burgers, salads, sandwiches and entrees -- again, ten-bucks plus!), and special offers throughout the year.  My last special offer was a free desert with the purchase of a burger, salad, sandwich or entree, every day in July.  It makes me happy, and the whole family happy, to get free stuff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-albany,3.56,3.56,3.56,3.024,3.5600000000000005

WE WON!! GO USA!!  We hoped to stop in Portland but between the traffic and our late start, there was no chance.  With two kids and a small dog, our choices were limited. Initially, we chose Applebee's across the parking lot, but they didn't have an outside seating area and we had no where to keep our beloved pooch comfortable and out of the blazing sun.  From the start they were very accommodating. Luckily there was no one sitting outside so they found us a seat with a great view of the game (inside), and a view of our dog in the shade just chillen on the patio too! Our waitress even brought cold water and some snuggles to him.  Bottom line..great service IMO. And the food was good as well. Tried the croissant BLTA and it was yummy. Girls had the new kids menu.

58,A L.,"Corvallis, OR",0,1,,2.0,2016-05-09,"I'm a die hard banzai burger fan, and my husband knows this. He took us to Red Robin for an early dinner on Mother's Day. I get it, busy day, hectic day, freaking crazy day! But the service was terrible, the food was merely okay. The tables around us were treated quickly, and I know our server probably wanted to be home with her mom or her kids, but we were treated to a cold personality despite the fact that my kids were great...They didn't even spill! Our server went on break after our food was served, and the other girl was busy with her other tables. Twenty minutes later, we still hadn't talked to her despite empty plates and drinks. She dropped of our check, never picked up our card. My hubby paid cash, and we left. No Mother's Day flower, like every other mom was getting, and a nice curt nod from the server. A tip was left because everyone has to make a living, but it was just disappointing. We weren't a large table. We were polite and happy. But we were ignored. We didn't complain, but I hope that the next holiday will find our servers in better moods for their customers, but we won't be among them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-albany?start=40,3.52,3.52,3.52,,3.5200000000000005

There where a couple and one guy at the bar. I was very impressed with my greeting. As it is barely before closing. I get it. Well my daughter is lanky and tall but she can eat. We ordered lol! Again very nice service! Now are going to eat!  Keep up the smiles and great customer service!

19,Carla S.,"Albany, OR",0,1,,1.0,2016-09-23,"We have had very crappy service at this location more than once. We've been exposed to snappy servers, and sloppy service. The tables and booths are disgustingly dirty and gross to the touch. The carpet and baseboards are nasty as well. Our most recent experience was terrible. We spent over $70, and when I ordered a kids meal with macaroni and cheese for my 11 month old, I asked if they could bring her drink as a sugar free peach tea for me, since my 11 mo old only drinks formula and wouldn't utilize the drink. They brought it in a larger cup and then charged me for it extra. When I questioned the server about it, she said that adults were not allowed to drink the kids drinks? I explained to her that my daughter wasn't able to utilize the drink, so it didn't matter who drank it at the table, that I paid for a kids meal with a kids drink, and that she never brought it to the table, but instead brought an adult drink that I didn't ask for and charged me for it. Her and the manager both argued with me about it. Saying that adults weren't aloud to have the kids drinks. I continued explaining to them that my daughter couldn't utilize the drink, and that it didn't matter who drank the drink at the table, it came with the kids meal that I ordered, and that it wasn't there job to decide who gets to drink it. They were more concerned with micro managing our table than treating us like customers that just spent a lot of money there.  We ordered 3 other kids meals for our older children, they all drank their own drinks, and we ordered 3 other adult sized drinks. We didn't order kids meals for ourselves, or try to order the bare minimum. I was just not wanting the one drink to go to waste, that came with my daughter's kids meal that she wasn't going to be able to drink. Finally after arguing for like 10 minutes in front of the whole restaurant, the manager offered us a $50 gift card. We declined. Its absolutely ridiculous that they were so pre occupied with me having that drink that I paid for, because I was somehow ""ripping"" them off, but then they were willing to hand over $50......come on people. This whole restaurant needs an over haul, staff and all. At this same visit while I was trying to strap my daughter into the highchair the server grabbed the highchair out of my hands and tried to push it up to the table before I even had my daughter strapped in. I had to ask her not to do that. Another time we had someone tell me not to order for my other daughter, when my daughter had asked me to. So so rude. When I started ordering for her, she said rudely ""I was talking to her not you, it's best if you let her order herself"". I was mad, and my shy daughter was mortified. Yet another time we ordered the root beer float, which we had previously ordered and enjoyed at the Salem location. At this albany location when we ordered 3 of them, they brought them to the table with the ice cream in one tall glass and the root beer in another so that we had to assemble and serve ourselves. This did not happen at the Salem location. Once again we questioned the manager about it, and explained to her that it was not served to us this way in Salem, nor was it pictured like this on the advertisement. The manager argued with us and said that's how they were supposed to come. Not sure what's wrong with this location, but we are done after tonight. Fed up! They don't even deserve one star at all!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-albany,3.36,3.36,3.36,,3.3600000000000003

21,Richard S.,"Albany, OR",0,17,,3.0,2016-10-31,"Very average in quality and service; have certainly been to better RR locations.  Prices a bit high for a burger place, with many approaching $14-15 for a burger. Many menu options, though.  I agree with others...could definitely be kept cleaner!  Be careful before sitting down...seats are often filthy. Don't know why, but you often have to battle with hostesses over seating options.  One should not have to beg and plead just to have a booth; especially when the place is 1/4 full!  Also, appears to be very high staff turnover, and the problems that go with that. Parking is in mall parking lots.  During warmer months, the close-in parking is taken by old cars and their club owners one night a week (Weds or Thurs?) and can make for a walk to get in.  They don't appear to be eating at RR, but definitely impact parking. Overall...nothing special!  Sadly there are few viable dining options in Albany.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-albany?start=20,3.24,3.24,3.24,,3.2400000000000007

The service has been getting progressively worse over the past couple of months and the wait times for food are really long, especially when you're there with a ticking time bomb (toddler). The quality doesn't seem great lately, and I've gotten attitude from servers when I get the wrong thing and ask to have it corrected.

The good: We were seated quickly at 1230 on a Saturday. The food and drinks were as expected. The rest: The table had not been wiped down when seated, we had to ask them to clean it. The tables have holes in the finish. The seat bottoms are torn & the seat backs need a deep cleaning as does the carpet on the floor. The restrooms also need cleaning and the paper towel dispensers were empty, there was a roll sitting on the counter. Service was rushed.

5,Kristina R.,"Silverdale, WA",3,23,8.0,2.0,2017-05-13,"Okay,  so I know Red Robin isn't fine dining,  so I don't go into this with unrealistic expectations. However,  I've had some decent meals at our local RR and gave this one a shot while visiting from out of town.  1.  Interior is in the middle of a remodel. I think. No clear signs,  but obvious unfinished projects. No biggie,  but ugly.  2. Arrived at a slow time (3pm) and was seated at a small table right next to the entrance/ exit from the kitchen. Lots of noise/ traffic. Servers hung out at that spot,  leaning on the back of my daughter's booth,  totally invading her personal space.  3. Initially introduced to a male server. We had our menus all of 30 seconds before he asked if we knew what we wanted. Umm, no. Didn't return for 10 more minutes, but then stated his shift was over and someone else would be taking over for him.  4. Food took 25 min to arrive. Again,  it was SLOW, only a handful of tables with people. We ordered a burger and a wrap,  no substitutions,  nothing complicated.  5. Food was ""meh"". Lettuce soft and wilty, otherwise ""ok"". Nothing spectacular. Plating/ presentation not like the one at home. Burger/ wrap on plate,  pile of fries next to it. The one at home has cute little metal ring things for the fries.  6. They forgot the ranch we ordered with the fries. Really not a big deal if the server hadn't just set our plates down and immediately turned to walk away.  7. Done with meal before anybody checked in to see how the food was or if we needed anything.  Should've just went to Burger King across the street. Would've had same quality food and service but spend $10 instead of $30.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-albany,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006

Only one salad had chicken (wasn't even extra chicken) and the other salad didn't even have chicken at all. Partly my fault because I should have double checked the bag before we left but we wanted to just get home after driving all day and I expected them to do their job right after paying good money for our salads.
