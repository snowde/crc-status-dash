69,Steven S.,"Richland, WA",42,53,16.0,1.0,2012-01-02,"Very bad experience here. I've been to many Red Robin restaurants and this was the worst. I ordered a margarita and it was completely watered down--way too much ice. Then I had the ensalada chicken and it came out completely cold and raw. The waiter took it back and it was reheated, only to come out rubbery on the outside and raw on the inside. The manager came over to us afterward and comped our dinner, but this was just disgusting. Definitely avoid this place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-albuquerque?start=60,2.9480000000000004,2.9480000000000004,2.9480000000000004,2.9480000000000004,2.9480000000000004
74,Migsy O.,"Albuquerque, NM",10,70,,4.0,2012-02-01,"This is a great place to come with kids, especially on Wednesdays, when they have free face painting, a balloon man who cruises the tables with his uncanny ability to make whatever object you desire out of balloons, and the big red bird himself.  When my siblings come to visit with my nieces and nephews, there is no easier and friendlier place to take the brood.  Here they can yell and whine, get out of their chairs to wander the restaurant, and exhibit all other manner of inappropriate public behavior, and no one is disturbed! Everyone else is occupied with their own unruly crew, and the noise level is such that it would take a lot to pierce the din. Ahhh, Red Robin.  Normally I eschew corporate dining establishments.  In most chain restaurants, the food is shipped in frozen and premade, the environment is too brightly lit and artificial, and the service tends to be canned and delivered by generally indifferent teenagers. Red Robin certainly does not wander off this beaten path.  But what about that tower of golden onion rings, deep-fried to perfection, served with an ungodly good  barbeque-mayo concoction? That bottomless basket of steak fries? And the burgers? In full disclosure, I am a vegetarian.  And let me tell you, Red Robin serves a profoundly gratifying veggie burger.  I try to eat primarily healthy, whole foods, I really do.  But sometimes a person just wants a veggie patty smothered with onion straws, sautéed mushrooms and blue cheese.  Served on a soft, white bun with a side of fried stuff.  It's bad for you and delicious, and I've learned to stave off the self-loathing with gentle reminders that there are more important things in the world to worry about than the size of my ass. I give Red Robin 4 stars while judging it against its competitors, which in my mind are other chain restaurants and burger joints.  The kids are fed and entertained, which allows the fully grown among us time to relax and enjoy our under-poured, over-priced, artificially-colored cocktails while talking shit and reaching for (this time I mean it) that last fry.  God damn, it's good to be an American!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-albuquerque?start=60,3.3440000000000003,3.3440000000000003,3.3440000000000003,3.3440000000000003,3.3440000000000003

As if I need to add any more salt right?  The shakes are usually good, except for the salted caramel...too much salt in that one.

Looks dirty, and just overwhelming. And time for a story.  Went there for my moms birthday sat on the patio and first problem that came up was the ground was full of a broken ketchup bottle all over had to hardly set my feet down to not get them nasty and dirty. When they brought us appetizer plates, my moms was not clean. It was quite dirty. My mom told him this plate isn't clean bring me a new one. So he argued that it was and then walked into the building (still in sight of us) and whipped it off with his shirt. Came out and tried to give it to her my mom called him out on it and said we watched you this isn't clean this is still dirty. Finally he brought  us a clean dish. It was a horrible experience.

Today my waitress kept forgetting what we ordered, poured water into our sprite, when we asked for more fries she said ""oh you're good?"" then walked off, she was out of it. Onto the positive stuff!

61,Rudy H.,"Albuquerque, NM",98,53,110.0,1.0,2014-06-06,"Well, I really don't like to give bad reviews but here goes. It started out well enough but I knew something was wrong when the waiter had 4 tables and he was having issues keeping track of his area. Granted I've never been a waiter and I'm not judging him but I saw other waiters that seem to have more tables and they seemed to tend to customers effortlessly. So I chalked it up to he must have been new. He meant well but I could easily tell he was overwhelmed. I ordered their new Colossus Burger and I didn't include the picture but instead I included a picture of the ""picture"" because once I got it, it looked nothing like the picture which made me kind of upset. I think if you advertise something it should look like the picture. Instead I got the lazy mans version which was pretty frustrating. There was suppose to be ""brisket"" on the burger but it was nowhere in sight and if it was, it was buried under the mounds of onions. I'm not a big fan of onions so I took it off looking for the brisket and I found maybe one or two small pieces. The burger it self was just ok, I could have done better at home honestly. Get a charcoal grill, fresh patties and BAM, a better burger then I ate. As the waiter was running from table to table, refilling drinks, he spilled a lemonade all over my brother in law. All in all not a great experience.

Chips, salsa and guacamole were just ok, I wouldn't order them again, but was hungry so we ate them. Shared twonthings, one of them being The fiery ghost tavern burger, on the menu says ""this combo of ghost pepper sauce, pepper jack cheese and fried and fresh jalapeños will have you seeing double."" The server told us the pic was deceiving.  That it is actually two kid patties, not two regular patties, we were fine with that and thankful she told us.  When we ordered it at a medium cook, she said we couldn't,  because they were small they had to come medium well...no bueno. However for just $2 more we could get a single large pattie and get it cooked to our liking. That resulted in about a 6 Oz pattie cooked well, awesome. There were only two fried jalapeños in the whole burger, but we're soggy from some sort of sauce slathered on both the top and bottom bun, I didn't wanna know what it was.  I would never order that burger again, and the size of the pattie was in no way worth the regular price of the burger, much less the $2 up charge.  We got a prime rib dip was was pretty good.  I understand that sourdough bread can get hard, but half of it was unedible.  I just had dental work done, no way was I gonna even attempt to chew that thing, but we ate most of the meat. K got mac n cheese, kraft if always reliable. The fries, well, we're HORRIBLE! And I remember really liking them. So I ordered a fresh side of fries which was brought to us still hot.  And those were delicious...for about 2 minutes.  They then we're hard and cold.   The 2 stars come from the expo window. ..and our burger and fries.  The expo window can be seen from most of the restaurant.  The kitchen was throwing out plates of food and they pretty much just sat in the window for minutes on end. I counted 11 minutes on a group of burgers cuz we had nothing else to do but wait for our server. Pretty sure reviews would be better if food got out hot, I'm sure we'll give it another chance, but not anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-albuquerque?start=20,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006

23,Fritz Vonhelm H.,"Albuquerque, NM",0,4,,1.0,2017-07-13,"Wife and I had their fish & chips for lunch with only lemonade & coleslaw.  Plenty of fish (Cod, 4 good sized pieces each).  Food was good but not worth a $45 check.  Tennis on all TV's.  This is an uptown hamburger joint?  Pretty expensive lunch!  Won't be lunching there again.  Or even dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-albuquerque?start=20,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
0,Vaughn F.,"Albuquerque, NM",20,250,244.0,5.0,2017-07-17,"My visit to Red Robin yesterday, after taking in a matinee at the Cinemark 24 theater, was as good as I could have hoped for. It had been a couple years since I'd been a patron at this franchise of burger-themed restaurants, and it was my first time at the Albuquerque location since childhood. With age, I've come to appreciate the efforts that Red Robin makes to accommodate families, couples, drinkers, and the young. There seems to be something for everyone here. I ordered a bottle of Miller Lite ($3.50) and, guided by my heart, opted for the A1 Peppercorn Burger (as lampooned in season 15 of South Park). The food arrived quickly, but after a few bites, it was clear that the meat wasn't medium-rare, but rather, well done. Weighing my options, I decided to seek satisfaction and notified my waitress that the burger wasn't prepared how I'd ordered it. She sent it back to the kitchen, and a replacement was brought out swiftly. The second time was the charm. Reasonably pink inside, I accepted this sandwich and savored every bite. My waitress was quick to keep the steak fries coming, and I certainly ate my fill. At some point, it's necessary to cut the cord before too much gluttony transpires. Overall, I was satisfied by the food, and I appreciated the kitchen staff's willingness to remake my hamburger. Though the addition of tablets to every booth and table brings Red Robin in line with Applebee's and Chili's for chilling post-millennial digital invasiveness, I understand how these devices can generate revenue and simplify certain ordering practices. At the end of the day, I still prefer old-fashioned human interaction, and this I received in abundance from the waitress. Perhaps on another special occasion I'll venture back to this eatery; meanwhile, I have happy memories to tide me over.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-albuquerque,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64

4,Dee S.,"Albuquerque, NM",49,26,29.0,4.0,2017-09-06,"Red Robin's! Yummmmmm... You can always count on Red Robin Gourmet Burger to satisfy that huge hunger feeling. I ordered the Advo-Cobb Salad which was extremely fresh, delicious and HUGE and my partner ordered the fish and chips which is my 2nd favorite item on the menu. Neither one of us finished our dinner, which meant we had left-overs for lunch the next day. We also had the Pickle Nickles for an appetiizer and the Pickle Nickle sauce is the bomb! Our server Ashley was perfect, checking in on us constantly, but not too frequently, to make sure we were well taken care of. Red Robin's is a fun place to take the family with large and small appetites, and everybody leaves happy and satisfied! We had had a very busy day and needed a good filling meal. You can always count on Red Robin's!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-albuquerque,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68

2,L R.,"Albuquerque, NM",101,26,40.0,4.0,2017-12-09,I really like the option of curbside to go I used it for the first time today and it was very easy and quick. I was a little disappointed that I bought the Avo-Cabo salad and it's a much smaller portion then it used to be. Also there were only three little slices of avocado in the salad. Considering the price is $10.99 and the name suggest there's gonna be a lot of avocado I was a bit disappointed. Otherwise the salad & the tea tasted good so that's a plus. Come on Red Robin don't be so cheap with the avocado next time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-albuquerque,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72
1,Jeremiah B.,"Los Lunas, NM",2,10,2.0,1.0,2018-01-03,"Firstly, the one star review had nothing to do with the server, Eric, because he was awesome. Sadly, a server can only do so much and all they do is place the order and deliver it anyway. My order was a ghost pepper burger but received a reg burger with BBQ sauce and jalapeño slices but no ghost pepper sauce and no jalapeño coins (fried and breaded). The cook argued with the waiter that it wasn't bbq sauce but there is a huge difference and this wasn't my first ghost pepper burger... this is the same burger I get every time I go to any Red Robin... and this was not it. When the waiter returned, I noticed all the cook did was shove 6 small jalapeño coins under the bun, crinkling the bun and not making the burger any better and the cook didn't add the ghost pepper sauce either.  I wasn't going to send it back again because I didn't want to eat spit or something else... I simply did without a burger because this one was horrible. Second thing that didn't help was the fact that we ordered Garlic Parmesan fries and they sent sweet potatoe fries instead... when the waiter brought my replacement fries... they were plain... not garlic Parmesan.   The waiter offered to take the burger off my bill but didn't see that taken off. We were running late so I just paid and decided to leave this review instead. By far the worst experience I've ever had at a Red Robin (And I've been to Red Robin's across the country. I'll never return to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-albuquerque,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72
