The kids love it because they always get a balloon, and the mac and cheese is bottomless.  I like it because the food is always good. The burgers are cooked and seasoned right, and consistent. The fries are bottomless and the seasoning at the table.. good stuff on the fries. I always order tarter sauce to go with my fries. The tarter sauce is a dill sauce and is awesome! They have good fish and chips too.. and the salads are good size and fresh.  The service is always good, the managers are always out making sure things are going well, and your drinks never go empty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-algonquin?start=20,2.9280000000000004,2.9280000000000004,2.9280000000000004,2.9280000000000004,2.928000000000001

Since it was a football Sunday, the servers were all wearing football jersey's from their favorite teams, which I thought was a neat idea.  I haven't been to Red Robin for at least a year, but I forgot how expansive the menu is.  Yes, they are a burger place, but there are so many other options.  We ended up going with the Philly Cheesesteak and the prime rib sandwich.  The food was delicious and of course the bottomless fries are always a perk.

The food was fine for what I knew it would be.  Nothing that I didn't expect already and no complaints on that front.  I just really couldn't get past the seating they gave us and the sticky menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-algonquin?start=20,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006

So him and my husband left the table. OF COURSE our waitress would arrive with them being gone. I kindly explained they would be right back and to please come back for our drink order. To my surprise (I have NEVER had this happen) she was taken back by it and reluctant to leave and come back! In her words- "" well where are the they? Can't I just take yours?"" Ummmm NO....

WRONG... Another FIRST for me at a restaurant (now I was REALLY thrown back by this!) I asked for their fried jalapeño rings on my burger (those are AWESOME)....

So next time people know what you're talking about""..... Oh- SERIOUSLY! Should have payed for our drinks and walked out then! Her attitude was unbelievable!

I never heard of Red Robin until I tried it out for the first time after moving in the area in 2007. This location was the first of many times is eat here. Definitely a good place to hang with friends while enjoying their amazing food. I should mention how they offer bottomless fries, or unlimited (sounds better). I can't get enough of the fries. The fact that they have plenty of burger options makes it seem a little difficult to order. But it's not that bad. The staff are friendly. It's a good place to bring the kids or hang as a group.

Or at least I thought I didn't. I tasted them and they neither tasted nor smelled like garlic, so I asked for a redo. I got what would pass for garlic fries, but was in reality just garlic salt a sprinkle of parmesan (for looks?) and their regular seasoning. Not worth the up charge.

Now the bad.   The burger.  Come on... this is a ""Gourmet Burger"" place,  what I received would not pass for a Wendy's $4 burger.  Oddly dry, not overcooked, just dry.   I opened the bun to have a look and the patty looked like it came from frozen.   Pre-processed, formed, pressed and oddly grey in color.   I had one paper thin, sad looking slice of tomato,  a transparent glaze of what was supposed to be cheese, one slice of bacon (the tastiest part of the sandwich) and nothing else.    But wait... where is my guacamole??   Well closer inspection (much closer) showed a green tint to the upper bun.   REALLY!  Just a smear of green color that imparted no flavor at all.    Color me  gravely disappointed.  $15 for this meal was not worth it.  Gourmet it is not.

The last time we were there they had this new table device called Robin; at first I thought it was going to be great but after 5-10 minutes I felt it was just another way to be ignored.  My wife ordered sweet potato fries and she received a small order with her meal but she was told she could request more; it was not until we were done with the meal that the second batch came. I have been coming here for around 10 years; if you asked me today if the food and service are better then when I first came I would say definitely not. This appears to be another instance of a chain that builds up a loyal following by great service and food and then tries to milk it by poorer service and poorer quality food; they will go the way of others and eventually stop existing.

The table was clean and we were quickly served. We all ordered chicken or burgers. The burgers that were cooked ""no pink"" were very dry, which was disappointing for those who ordered ""no pink"". I personally thought that my ""some pink"" burger was cooked to perfection. The biggest complaint we had as a party is the lack of personal service. The machines placed on each table are capable can take orders, bring your receipt, and give you the ability to contact your waitress to demand a refill. Although the technology is incredible, it takes away the satisfaction of being served. I hate to say it, but I almost feel that the ""average tip of 15%"" is not needed when the machine does all the work.

The chicken that supplied the meat must have been from a chicken concentration camp. Small and paper thin. One unfresh slice of tomato the size of a silver dollar. One wilted piece of lettuce. The bun was normal size though. So that was going good for me. When asked how my meal was I responded. The manager was soon at our table following up. He discounted our meal or something. Which was nice. If we went back I'm certain nothing will have changed. Hard to believe this place went from being so good to so bad. I found out this particular RR went from being privately owned to corporate owned and everything made sense. I think the former manager (who led this RR like Patton led the 3rd Army) is now managing BWW across the parking lot.   Guess which place moved up the list when RR moved down?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-algonquin,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004
38,J P.,"Hoffman Estates, IL",0,9,4.0,3.0,2016-08-14,"I really loved this place. Unfortunately now they are getting rid of the wine selections, which is a bummer since their other drinks are all mixers and no alcohol for what you pay for them. I wish they would clean the tables better. The salt and pepper shakers are always sticky along with the drink menus. I feel dirty when I touch these items and have to eat French fries with my fingers. Just a little more diligence in cleaning and more options for wines, this place would be great again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-algonquin,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004
23,Kayla R.,"Crystal Lake, IL",4,83,,3.0,2016-10-03,"I come to Red Robin maybe once every 2 or 3 years and it's honestly not that impressive. I'm a simple eater, so I ordered the original cheeseburger. It was cooked beautifully but that pickle relish RUINED the whole thing for me. Doesn't look or taste like pickles at all, and very overpowering. The fries are amazing and definitely worth getting seconds or thirds, but next time I come here, I'm going to ask for no pickle relish. I think the burger would've been a high B, low A without it. Also, on the day that I went, all of the kegs were broken so no draft beer was served. Additionally, the bill for two people was just over $30 without tip-- two burgers, two Cokes, and one Corona. Overall, decent burger place. Expensive by my standards, but seems like a cool date night place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-algonquin,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005
27,Charlene M.,"Carpentersville, IL",0,22,8.0,1.0,2017-01-22,"We decided to order on the phone and then picked it up. The drive back home took us 5mins. Right when we got home, the food was not even warm. My uncle ordered the guacamole burger, I think, and the bread was soooo soggy. We also ordered regular fries but apparently they heard sweet potato fries. Everything was soggy. We ended up throwing everything out. What a waste of food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-algonquin,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92
20,Brian F.,"Lake in the Hills, IL",337,183,285.0,4.0,2017-01-28,"Our family comes here a few times a year. If you're a member of the free rewards program, you get a free burger on your birthday. On this occasion, we came because we were in the mood for the Cobb salad, dubbed here as the Avo-Cobb-O. The portion is large, and at over $10, it had better be! The fresh avocado with the bacon and bleu cheese is a killer combo. What really stood out is that when we let the server know that we were splitting the salad, they actually prepared two separate plates for us! If you've split a salad before, you know that it can get messy and hard to make sure the ratios are even. Yes, salad OCD, I know. My father thinks the burgers are overpriced, but I think it comes with the portion size and the unique combinations. My favorites have been the Royal, and the Chili Chili, though I have had almost every single one. I don't recommend any soups, but I do recommend one of the amped up sauces for your fries. I like the garlic aioli.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-algonquin,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88

22,Robyn W.,"Waukegan, IL",74,14,1.0,1.0,2017-03-10,WORST RED ROBIN I HAVE EVER BEEN TO!!!! you'd have a better lunch starving than eating here!  1st we went on a Saturday afternoon so we expected it to be busy. We sat at the bar no biggie. The first thing I notice is the glasses they are serving us out of we're dirty and have terrible water spots all over and this wasn't just us it was every glass the bartender used.  We order the food was alright definitely nothing to write home about but I also got the most basic thing a wedge salad and my friend got some burger with an egg on it. But what I couldn't help but notice while sitting at the bar is how dirty this place is. And not to mention I didn't have silverware for 10mins after getting my meal. (The silverware sitting my my place setting was clearly used by previous guest),https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-algonquin,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84
29,Charles M.,"Crystal Lake, IL",19,40,10.0,3.0,2017-03-26,Great service. Just too darn expensive! Calling the burgers gourmet doesn't justify the prices on the burgers or other menu items.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-algonquin,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8
24,Great Reviewer C.,"Wheaton, IL",4,17,3.0,1.0,2017-05-20,"If there was a zero this is what I would give this place. We ordered food and it was totally wrong when delivered. The next table had the same issue.  Then, after waiting over 30 min, we get the check, they overcharged us for the incorrect meals. They already ran our card, so insisted on giving us a gift card to cover the difference. Why can't they just refund our money.  So, we go back to use the GC, and decide to sit at the bar since it was busy. Guess what? The food was incorrect, again! It's not rocket science to order a burger. What a joke, and what a mistake. No refills were offered on food, fries or drinks and we had to wait 17 min just for the bartender to run the check. Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-algonquin,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
26,Brian R.,"Woodstock, IL",0,7,,2.0,2017-07-07,"We dine here once a month, but tonight we were victim of terrible service. Waitress wasn't very attentive for a 9pm dine in a restaurant that busy.  Slow to bring drink refills, silver ware, and fry baskets. I asked that they change TV channel from exhibition basketball to a meaningful baseball game. While I was told they'd do it right away, 30 mins later it was still exhibition basketball.  This won't stop us from returning, but they better improve service next time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-algonquin,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72
25,MïxedMülatto W.,"Algonquin, IL",1,1,,3.0,2017-10-18,"I ordered the pub mac n cheese. Despite being on the kids' menu, it was extremely small and over half my plate was French fries -- which I wouldn't have minded if we had not already been served bottomless French fries as an appetizer. Freckled lemonade was decent. They have a can of their signature seasoning at each table and I definitely recommend adding it to French fries for an additional kick of flavor. Came here on my birthday and they did give a free sundae and had 2 waitresses sing happy birthday to me while clapping their hands.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-algonquin,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68
