40,Lauri Y.,"Charlotte, NC",10,9,,1.0,2012-12-05,Decided to go and grab a burger.  We were immediately seated.  We waited 10 mins before we were approached by ANYONE!  Our presence wasn't acknowledged one time.   Customers should always be greeted by waitress/waiter quickly after they're seated!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-allentown?start=40,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002
50,Michelle S.,"Holmdel, NJ",0,30,,4.0,2012-12-09,"I've been to this red robin quite a few times. It's gotten better over the past few visits. It seems quieter than it used to be, although that may be due to me going at different times. The food is decent. Your typical burger fare with a few specialty toppings. What brings it up to 4 stars for me is the presence of a gluten free menu the last time I was there. GF is hard to come by in the valley and its a bummer for celiacs who can't just break their diet for a single meal. Their burger bun was really pretty good for gluten free and the selection of allergy sensitive  food options in general made me feel like they are really trying to appeal to anyone who walks through the door. The waiter was very nice and really bent over backwards to make sure the GF thing was done right. It looked like he might have been a manager. In general, the waitstaff is young and you may be left waiting longer than a usual burger joint. But enjoy the atmosphere. There is a lot to look at, and if you aren't insistent on being a typical American (fast foodie), you might actually enjoy a longer meal. If you're in a super rush to eat, you're in the wrong place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-allentown?start=40,2.576,2.576,2.576,2.576,2.576

21,Christopher C.,"Conshohocken, PA",168,1318,6419.0,3.0,2013-08-03,"We got here mid-afternoon and were seated right away as things were fairly quiet. Made the mistake of starting with the pretzel bites.  Five dollars for a microscopic cup of dipping cheese along I think ten very ""bite sized"" pretzels.  It's no wonder on the promo material they choose to not show the price.  If they did who would order it? We did a burger and some sort of chicken parm-type pasta dish. The burger was the limited time Berzerker that they're pushing and our server did a horrible job explaining that this thing packs some pretty serious heat.  Just saying ""it's a little hot"" does not begin to describe the spicy aioli on this thing. The pasta dish was alright although the outer coating on the chicken was fried really, really hard.   The service was alright.  We never waited too long for drink refills although our server couldn't be bothered to remove any dirty dishes and things piled up at the end to the point of having no space on the table. They sort of try to push the little console on the table to order apps, drinks, desserts from along with paying to play games, music, apps and who knows what else but we didn't bother with it because in all honesty the tables are too small and it mostly was in the way the entire time so we didn't use it out of spite. I see after fifteen reviews this place is sporting three stars.   All things considered, that's about spot on. If you look in the dictionary under the word average, I'm pretty sure that places like Red Robin, Crapplebees, Ruby Tuesday and their offshoots all make an appearance. What this place boils down to is average service with average decor along with average food.  If you want your palette challenged or intrigued this is not where you want to come.  If you want something that's quasi-quick, mindless and easy then this is for you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-allentown?start=20,2.476,2.476,2.476,2.476,2.476

35,Frank S.,"Quakertown, PA",3,28,2.0,1.0,2013-11-14,"Today was my last visit to this Red Robin, maybe to any of them. I stopped for lunch today (Thursday - week day). I work the local area and usually dine alone for lunch. I spend my lunch hour reading the newspaper, so I always ask for a larger booth. I have never been met with so much resistance when asking for a specific seating arrangement. The hostess was actually trying to negotiate with me, she asked if a table section in those long rows where like 20 people can sit next to each other would be ok. I said I'd just prefer a larger booth. She said ok and took me to one of those table sections anyway. I should have just walked out then. I sat down anyway. It was not overly busy and there were four booths in my line of sight that I would have preferred to sit. Those booths were empty the whole time I was there. Please tell me Red Robin what is the deal with your seating procedures. It may not matter to some people but it does me. I am done pleading, begging and negotiating to get the table I want.   If you can't tell, this is not the 1st time this has happened at RR.  It's one of many, but today was my breaking point.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-allentown?start=20,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18

I am absolutely obsessed with the whiskey river bbq chicken sandwich, and that's all I ever get. I try to break away and try other things, but in the end that sandwich always seems to win out. friend got a milkshake, and we ordered an appetizer of zucchini sticks and jalapeno coins. they were great, though I was paying for those coins the next day lol. anyway, entrees came out, his burger was great. my sandwich.. im not sure what happened. I picked it up and a river of grease came out of it. I don't mean a few drops, I mean a river that filled my plate. since its a chicken sandwich im not really sure where it came from.. my only guess could be the fried onion straws they put on it. I was able to eat almost half of it before it completely disintegrated and I couldn't stomach it. in all the years and all the red robins, including this one, never had that happen before. so why the 5 stars? well our very friendly waitress came to check on us just as I was trying to clean my hands off and I mentioned and pointed out the grease. she was extremely apologetic and was offering me a new sandwich, or something else off the menu to make up for it. I politely declined, as I had indeed eaten half of this one, not a few bites.. and I wouldn't have been able to eat a sandwich and a half. she really tried to right it but I didn't think it was a huge deal. a few minutes later the manager came over and asked about it and again offered me another sandwich, or even one to take home. I politely declined again, and instead opted to just get a little dessert. he then took that sandwich off our bill! they didn't have to do that, and I really think it shows the good service they have. ill still go back for my whiskey river bbq sandwich, and awesome fries, i think this was just a weird fluke of a bad sandwich.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-allentown?start=20,2.7399999999999998,2.7399999999999998,2.7399999999999998,2.7399999999999998,2.7399999999999998

We were seated promptly in the bar area (booth) and noticed that the restaurant wasn't that busy. Though the bartender was swamped. After about 5 minutes of us sitting there she came out for our drink order and disappeared. The manager walked by our table numerous times (I think his name was Tony) and kept looking at our blank empty table. Well 15 minutes later our drinks came out, Mai Tai, 2 berry moscato's (I think) and I had the freckled lemonade  - I was the DD. The alcoholic beverages came out first and mine didn't come out for another 5 minutes! So we are now 30 minutes in and getting our drinks, as soon as she put our drinks down we ordered our food. The food came out at a pretty quick speed, the presentation of the bruchetta burger I ordered was very gross and it didn't look appetizing. But I've eaten it before, so I know that it taste fantastic. We ordered bottomless fries right away, those came out about 6 minutes later, fresh from the fryer. We all loved our food (hence the 4 stars), but the Mai Tai was too strong, which we told the bartender and she took it off our bill. All in all this was one of the better experiences I have had, but the timing was so off. People at the bar got drinks way before we ever did and we were there longer.

I have never been to a Red Robin before so I thought I would give it a go. Sure it's a ""gourmet"" burger place, but we don't have enough of these around these days (sarcasm). Anyway I orderered the prime chop, sounds fancy, and I ordered it medium rare. It came out medium well. So I figured I would just wait till the bartender stopped by and asked how my burger was. He never asked, as a matter of fact after I received my food he never asked me anything, refilled my water or even tried to sell me anything. So no point in complaining. I just ate the overcooked burger and paid my bill (which I had to ask for) and left. To the bartenders credit it was a busy holiday (har har) with two other patrons at the bar. My main question to restauranteurs is: how is there no check and balance when one person puts in medium rare and the ""gourmet burger chef"" cooks it medium well?

3,Kelsey M.,"Emmaus, PA",68,86,93.0,2.0,2016-06-19,"tl;dr: food was eh/alright; service was just *so* slow Normally, I'm a fan of the chain. There's one in my hometown that's amazing and certainly a solid 4 stars because of the service and quality of food.  This Red Robin, not so much. The food was alright. I ordered the bruschetta chicken sandwich, a dish that I've had elsewhere at other Red Robins. It alright but not as much flavor as it normally has and a little saltier than normal. The fries had kind of an off taste to them from what I am used to. The ice tea I ordered was a little watery. Overall, it wasn't terrible but not great either. But the food isn't what's killing the review (it's actually what kept it from a 1-star-review). The service was definitely sub-par. The hostess was nice and we were seated at our table quickly, but things went downhill once our waiter came to the table. The service by the waiter was just so slow and I don't get why because it wasn't packed and with the amount of people on shift, the place hardly looked short-staffed.  Now you might think I am exaggerating how slow he was (time can move slowly when you're waiting) but I had the Cavalier/Warriors playoffs game blaring at me from three different a TVs in the background serving as my meter of time (and this game just really stuck with me). It went something like: 7:55ish (before the game is on ESPN): seated at table, waiter takes drink orders. 8:15ish (tip-off already happened; game underway): waiter comes back with the ice tea and water we ordered (20 minutes for that?); takes food order.  8:20ish (warriors just came back from a timeout to score a 3): appetizer comes. The food actually comes out pretty quick.  8:26ish (warriors and Cavs tied): food comes out. Again, food came quickly.  8:27ish (taken maybe two or three bites of food): server checks in to see if the food is good.  And here's where the waiter basically forgets about us.  8:40ish (first quarter has ended): I'd been hoping to get a refill for about 5 minutes. Don't see waiter anywhere.  8:46ish (warriors score a bunch in a row because the table next to us is happy): give up on getting a refill because I'm done with my food but hoping to get a box.  8:55ish (warriors were behind and just got back in the lead): waiting for the check and just want a box. My friend and I remember we can pay on the computers on the tables but doesn't solve box dilemma. Still no waiter (or really any waiter who's attention we can call.)  8:56ish: notice ""call server"" button on computer. Press. 9:05ish (Cavs are starting to close the gap on the warriors lead): I was just about ready to get up and rifle through the waiters' supply stand when the waiter comes back. He apologized half-heartedly for not checking back sooner because he was making drinks.  Perhaps he was having a bad day? I don't know. Service jobs are hard and often thankless jobs, but tonight was not his night for service. Nearly 40 minutes between check-ins is just way too long.  I'm so bummed to give Red Robin a bad review because I really do like the chain. But this location just wasn't good.  Maybe 2 stars is too generous?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-allentown,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56

4,Donita C.,"Northampton, PA",115,79,16.0,3.0,2016-12-12,"Went on a Sunday night around 7pm, not very busy, so I was seated and attended to immediately. Started with a bowl of New England chowder and ordered a plain cheeseburger, prepared medium a.k.a. With some pink according to their menu, with bottomless steak fries. The soup was meh, very liquidy and the potatoes were just shy of being tender. Like it wasn't stirred from the bottom before serving.  I did use some of the cracked pepper from the grinder on the table, that grinder is amazing! Nicely coarse black pepper!  That was the highlight of that soup. It was served with two slices of crusty bread that I think we're supposed to be garlic toast. Two bites of that was enough for me. The burger came before I had finished my soup (I really hate that).  I tasted a fry immediately before they got cold. It was hot, yes. Finished soup, started in on the burger.  It had no pink, but it was not dry at least. Server did offer to have it remade but I just wanted to eat.  (Applebees does this all the time too, no pink when you ask.) The burger was average, nothing to rave about. I liked they were generous with the cheese and it was seasoned properly. Pretty large patty, I only ate a little more than half of it. The fries tasted better with the seasoning they have on the table, but even though the fries were not burned and had crunch, they were very dry on inside. I suspect they were sitting under a heat lamp. I think I ate only 8 of them and when I was asked if I needed more, I declined.  Their fries have potential to be kick butt if their fresh, I bet, especially with that seasoning (they also have salt grinder on the table). All in all, typical chain food, always meets my average expectations.  My bill was about $24 with tip. Dang. Won't get a burger there anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-allentown,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68
12,Soni D.,"Bethlehem, PA",13,11,1.0,5.0,2016-12-23,This place has the best and most affordable gourmet burgers in the Lehigh Valley! Their new menu has lower prices and tasty new items including dipping sauces which are free. The tabletop electronic order/pay/play machine makes ordering and paying so much easier than waiting for the waitress. The decor is nice and the staff here are very accommodating and helpful.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-allentown,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
11,Maxine S.,"Mesquite, NV",19,6,,4.0,2016-12-25,"The place was freezing on Christmas Eve, the waitress moved us to another booth but it was still cold I had to wear my coat and scarf the entire time. Maybe it was to keep the cooks comfortable but shouldn't the guests be comfortable?

5,Amy C.,"Whitehall, PA",1,23,8.0,1.0,2016-12-27,"Awful. First time going there, will never go back. Ordered medium rare burger, waitress said ok. Food comes out, it's way over done. She doesn't come back for 20 minutes, and I tell her it's over cooked. She just says they don't do medium rare there, only ""some pink"" ...Why would you not tell me that when I ordered it? I wouldn't have gotten a burger then. No apology, no fixing it. Fries were cold, too. So it was basically like throwing $30 away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-allentown,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64

7,Dee L.,"Lehigh Valley, PA",1,30,,1.0,2017-05-07,"This restaurant has steadily been going downhill over the past six months and after today's visit,  we are through after being customers for more than 5 years. The restaurant is simply too cheap to hire the help it needs to respond to customers and one bartender today had to cover more than half a dozen tables. We were served warm ""iced"" tea because Red Robin obviously couldn't have any kitchen staff come in 30 minutes prior to opening to ensure the iced tea was ready to serve. We waited 15 minutes for the check and spent almost 80 minutes for a lunch in which only entrees were ordered. The fried clams were overcooked and inedible and our order was missing the promised cole slaw which we had to ask for. The restaurant has been ""redecorating"" for over a month and it looks like crap. Spend your money elsewhere!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-allentown,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72

6,Zachary P.,"Bethlehem, PA",6,15,1.0,5.0,2017-06-15,"Me and my family went to this Red Robin yesterday and had a great experience! Our food was out in a reasonable amount of time and everything we ordered was great! I got a Bacon Cheeseburger, which I would highly recommend to anybody. We visited while the restaurant was being remodeled, but that did not affect our experience in any way. I was a bit disappointed however to find out that the TVs that used to be built into the floor for customers to watch while waiting to be seated, had been taken out, but that's alright since we came for food and not TVs! Parking is great, so there is no need to worry about that! Signs will direct you to exit and enter the property using Airport Road since Airport Road can be a bit difficult to get across in certain areas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-allentown,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68
