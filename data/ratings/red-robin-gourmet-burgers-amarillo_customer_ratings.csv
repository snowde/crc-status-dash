42,Matt P.,"Lubbock, TX",8,11,4.0,2.0,2012-07-20,Not memorable. Had the blue ribbon burger and steak fries. The burger was okay but looked preformed.

37,Scott S.,"Hoboken, NJ",104,213,,2.0,2013-05-03,"I kinda wish I manned up and took a stab at Amarillo's 72oz steak challenge! -From a pure burger perspective, it's not very good, but the overall sandwich was  good.  Fries were dissappointing -Service, specifically at the bar was very good -Restaurant was clean -beer was delicious -Price: tough to comp it - compared to shake shack, In n out, etc, it's very expensive.  compared to other chain restaurants, I suppose it's pretty much in-line.  The burger was sized well, but smaller than other chains, so I think from a value perspective, it's not good. I've always wanted to try red robin, because it's usually ranked pretty highly in various blogs, burger challenges, and such.  I was rather excited when it was right next to my hotel.  I had no idea they had a full menu, which I guess is pretty cool.  That said, I was here for a burger, so the only decision really was choosing between the 8 or so variations they had on the nice, clean laminated menu.  I had my eyes on a few of them, and ultimately decided to go with the whiskey bbq burger.  Sounds like a solid choice, right?  My thoughts exactly.  Read on to empathize with my dissappointment.  I place my order and the anticipation builds.  The friendly barkeep brings me over a bigass glass of really, really cold, draft beer.  I am thinking it's shaping up to be a good day.  Five or so minutes later, a plate with my meal arrives. First glance, everything looks in order, nice place of thick steak fries.  Quickly go for one of them and in an instant, my mood changed drastically.  Not because I am bipolar, but as i bit into the soft, lukewarm, tasteless fry, I realized I am eating frozen supermarket fries that have not been cooked long enough.  I tried to buck up and think that well, the whole slogan ""yummm"" is about their burgers, and doesn't really encapsulate the fries.   ....drink half of my cold beer to try and put the french fry experience behind me..... So I try the burger, and further sank into a very melancoly mood.  I mean, I thought that's what Texas did...beef!!....they give you two choices, medium or medium well.  I opted for medium yet was served a a charcoal brick.  A thin one at that.  It's kind of comparable to like Five Guys or Mcdonalds or Taco Bell - where y ou know it tastes great, but it's not because it's good meat, it's the whole concotion.  It's not really a true burger experience, but just the whole thing with fried onions and whiskey BBQ sauce all over.  The bun was OK, kind of tasteless, almost stale, but it was def solid in composition, but without the character of say, a nice piece of ciabatta.  that said, Ill take that over something lacking structural integrity and crumples easily.   So from a true, pure, burger afficando persepctive, it fails.  Miserably.  From a grab a couple buddies, drink beer and have something that tastes good and is fun to eat, it's very passable, athough I would'n't say it surpasses a Chilis kind of thing.   But fries kind of complete the experience, and that wasn't good.   As i mentioned earlier, regarding price/value, it's tough to come up with what an accurate comparison should be.  Put it against shake shack (sorry, I believe the nearest shake shack to you guys is in the Woodlands, or even Phoenix) or in n out, it fails by being substantially more expensive.  Put it up against a chain restaurant, and I think it doesn't pack enough weight to compare.  Overall, it doesn't seem to be a good value.  I would think that many local bar and grills would be a better option.   From a chain point of view, I believe there was an Outback nearby, which I would much rather prefer on taste, value, and awesome fries.  they also serve good beer at the bar and have that awesome bread to start off with.   With all that being said, maybe it was a little hit or miss and I happened to have it on an off day.  Perhaps my particular food server had alot on his or her rmind that day, so said server was off their game.  Happens to me too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-amarillo?start=20,2.7920000000000007,2.7920000000000007,2.7920000000000007,2.7920000000000007,2.7920000000000007

This is what I experienced. And all of it points to poor management  Example number one: employees sitting at the bar drinking. Number two... Stepping over piles of swept up trash from the floor en-route to your table. Example 3 at least 10 tables not having been bused up after patrons have left. By the way multiple employees are milling  about during this time not lending any kind of hand towards cleaning any of the tables. I stopped here to eat after driving all day so I had to use the restroom. I took a picture of the bathroom with the towels piled so high it was almost comical.  Let's talk about the food got the red Robin Burger nothing special french fries lukewarm. Once my food was served I had to ask for silverware to eat with. I report...you decide.  Today April 19th Got a follow up phone call from Jason (I assume the manager) after this post. His primary concern was how did I know that employees were drinking at the bar.

23,John S.,"Amarillo, TX",24,25,22.0,2.0,2015-05-18,"I made a stop at the Red Robin in Amarillo yesterday & while I love their burgers  I wouldn't recommend ordering an appetizer. This has been a reoccurring problem & not just recent.  I had ordered 7 boneless wings on top of a bed of chips topped with onion strings. Instead I received 4 wings with bone-in minus the onion strings. Not getting the onion strings wasn't a big deal. But getting 4 with bones instead of 7 boneless is part of an ongoing problem at this location. I've had appetizers that came out warm or cool and/or incomplete.  A guy seated behind me cancelled his appetizer because it took too long to come out. Another guy seated outside on the patio brought his check in & paid his waitress on the way out since he hadn't seen her for a while.  I had ordered the Banzai Burger & fries with a side of Campfire Sauce. The Banzai was fine, the fries were lukewarm & the Campfire Sauce was missing. I didn't even bother bringing it to the bartenders' attention. She was sweet enough to reorder my wings for me & not charge me for the wrong ones.  I'm a fan of Red Robbin but not in Amarillo. There's too many places to eat in this town. Especially if you want a burger. I'm not sure if the order is put in wrong or if the kitchen is inept. Either way paying $10.99+ for a burger & fries is way too much to be incomplete & of questionable quality.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-amarillo?start=20,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44

We ordered the Poutine appetizer.  I was skeptical because I love the dish at IDK and I was worried I would be disappointed.  Luckily, this dish in a class of its own - IDK serves a more traditional Poutine and this appetizer had a lot of extra frills such as mushrooms and a garlic aioli.   It was a delicious departure from the classic. I had the Red's Tavern Double - Pig Out Style (bacon and more bacon) with lots of campfire sauce on the side.  Trav's mom had the same.  Travis ordered the Banzai Burger and his mom's date had the Smokin Pepper burger.  I only heard ""mmmmm"" during our meal.  Everyone was happy.  Burgers were cooked appropriately, buns were hot and fresh and the toppings were plentiful.   Trav and I split a Boozy Jack Daniel's Vanilla Malt for dessert and it was strong and tasty, as always.

We waited there for 10 min with no information nothing not hey sorry they cleaning your table or we are waiting on a table nothing just chilling and having there chats like we Re sitting in there living room. People go out to eat pay money so that they can be treated and won't have to do it themselves at home. I would rather cook myself food than pay money to a company who staffs people so inconsiderate for the clients.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-amarillo,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88
3,Kristen W.,"Lubbock, TX",43,28,19.0,1.0,2017-05-11,"So I wish I would have seen some of these reviews before eating here. We had a really good experience at this Red Robin a few years ago and coming from miles away -- we really looking forward to eating here.  We were seated quickly and all seemed to go well until we noticed that we were not being served as often as other tables. As we sat waiting for our food we noticed the people in front of us, who were seated around 10 minutes after us, got their food in a prompt manner while our waitress (who was nice and not rude at all) was no where to be seen.  After finally getting our food, my mother, who got the salmon, found that it was not grilled as advertised but fried and was way overcooked (my guess is that it was cooked on the flat top grill they used for cooking burgers and so they 'think' that means grilled but that's like frying on a pan and not grilling over a flame). My mom returned the burnt one and got another one--but later didn't eat that one either. Just imagine a flat and fried piece of salmon laid on a browning piece of lettuce... and then having to pay $13 for that. Thankfully, they did take that item off my mom's ticket. My dad and mine's burgers were also sub-par (for a burger place)... flavorless meat, hardly any toppings, and fried toppings were greasy. In agreeing with what some of the other people have said it just seems like the idea of service (even from the manager) is that the customers are the inconvenience and it's just a place to hang out with each other. Could be wrong or maybe it was a weird period, but this was our experience. And I really hope this gets fixed because this used to be an old stand-by.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-amarillo,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88

8,Tamara P.,"Frisco, TX",4,8,2.0,1.0,2017-05-28,Probably the most expensive horrible burger I have ever eaten. Burnt and dry. My husband upgraded to the sweet potato...he got less than a handful. Only thing that was even decent was our server.

9,Terri M.,"Amarillo, TX",177,6,10.0,5.0,2017-06-24,"I am very hard to please, and yes 3 years ago we had a mediocre experience. But we went in today and it was excellent! We had the onion ring tower and everyone got burgers and they were fresh, flavorful, moist and delicious! Truthfully a great experience! We will most definitely be back and know that the new management is really putting their all into the food and atmosphere. Very family friendly and relaxing. Great seating and clean surroundings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-amarillo,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8
0,JT N.,"Austin, TX",65,114,136.0,4.0,2017-07-24,"The staff were friendly, and the food tasted great...just like many other Red Robin's that we've visited. Removing one star because even though the staff was fun, personable, and helpful, our server only came back to check on us at the very end of our meal. There were a couple of refills that we would have liked filled during the visit, but was only able to get one...and then ended up packing it because our kids were antsy and done. Maybe he didn't come check on us because (we later discovered that) you can ""call"" the waiter/waitress to your table with a blinking light on the mini tablet on the table...and we didn't notice it till the end.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-amarillo,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88

7,Linda K.,"Dallas, TX",0,19,4.0,3.0,2017-08-14,We checked into the Hilton Homewood Suites in Amarillo Texas on our way to Albuquerque. My husband had a hamburgerhamburger and steak fries which were fabulous but hamburger was mediocre. I ordered tortilla soup and a salad. The salad was OK but the soup was horrible. The soup was not clear broth but some sort of sticky gravy stuff. Pretty much ate some of my husbands steak fries. I did have the lemonade frosty with no alcohol and it was fabulous,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-amarillo,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8

1,PritchStan P.,"Atlanta, GA",0,12,3.0,1.0,2017-12-28,"*receipt showing vegan burger included in photos In summation, if you choose to eat here either order over the phone for vegan options or contact the manager directly in order to confirm what you are getting as our food did not match our order. We ordered 2 vegan burgers on their to go menu online. After we arrived home from picking up the food, we noticed a dairy looking topping. We called Red Robbin and were informed it was dairy. When we returned to get a refund the manager stated they didn't have the vegan burger and that it was a ""veggie build"". This was an interesting statement as their veggie burger has a bun and our burger had a lettuce wrap as it states on their to go menu for only the vegan burger. The ""veggie build"" includes a bun not a lettuce wrap. The vegan burger on their to go order did not include any dairy in the description, yet our vegan burger had tomatoe aioli (dairy) on it.  The manager condescendingly asked if I was dairy intolerant which seemed extremely ignorant and insensitive for a company selling a vegan burger. As if she was implying the only reason to not want to consume dairy was because of an allergy. We are Vegan hence we don't consume dairy for a number of reasons. Regardless, we ordered something without dairy and expected them to hold up their end of the deal by not including dairy.  Additionally we ordered the garlic herb fries (no parm), there were no herbs. Online it states the vegan burger comes with broccoli which was also missing. The manager did apologize several times and gave us our money back. However this was a huge hassle. It was also irritating that even though we could order a vegan burger online, the manager stated they didn't actually have a vegan burger at this location and were given the ""veggie build"" (this didn't add up as the veggie build has a bun and our burger had a lettuce wrap) and the manager implied the only reason to not want food with dairy was due to a dairy allergy. This is very condescending towards vegans. We would possibly try this location again if we were able to confirm our order and they became more vegan friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-amarillo,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
