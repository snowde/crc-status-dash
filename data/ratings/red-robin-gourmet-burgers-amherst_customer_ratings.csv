I'd give them 3.5 stars, but I'll be nice and round up to 4. 2 people got burgers with fries, 1 person got turkey burger and 1 person got cod fish sandwich (which came in a burger bun). We shared mac & cheese and broccoli side dishes. The burgers are HUGE and fries are THICK, warm and their special seasoning sprinkled on top (you sprinkle). The burgers were made to order, so they were fresh and pretty good. No one had anything to complain about. The fries ARE unlimited because the waitress brought us a whole new basket to share (fresh).  Service was attentive, but not in your face and the restaurant very clean. Their burgers aren't the most unique, but their fries and the fact that YOU, the customer, can control the seasoning bumped their rating to 3.5 (4) stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-amherst?start=80,3.12,3.12,3.12,3.12,3.1200000000000006

Great gourmet burgers.  You can build your own or go with one of their custom burgers.  I recommend the pinapple one... yummy!  But if you aren't in the mood for a burger they have a good menu... salads (and not only iceberg lettuce like other Buffalo restaurants!), chicken, turkey burgers...etc. It's an upscale burger joint with unlimted steak fries!  How could you go wrong?  You're talking to a fry-a-holoic here!  Yes, they give you limited fries to begin with but you can run the waitress as often as you like for a refill on the fries.  And i am one that doesn't feel shy about that one! Totally a great burger and you can even get sweet potato fries... but those aren't unlimited.  Milk shakes are yummy too!  I'd totally recommend this place... why go to burger king or mcdonalds when you can go up the street and eat a decent burger for just a little bit more money?

They have the burgers looking all big, tall, and juicy with all these toppings on 'em and mmm... *wiping drool up.* What a tease since there is not 1 freakin' location near me. Well, I had no idea there were any locations in NY, so I was surprised when my honey found this one. I ordered the guacamole burger, steak fries, and a Pepsi (since sweet tea is non-existent here, LOL!). My burger was big & plump; I could barely finish. BUT--- the flavor was lacking a little. Do they not season the beef? I dunno. But it was a bit plain, even with the guacamole. The fries were great, and our server told us they were ""bottomless"". We totally did not take advantage of that, though.  I limped to the car with a full belly and my left-overs and was glad to say I've finally visited a Reeeed Robin!

77,Mike M.,"Toronto, Canada",4,98,2.0,4.0,2012-11-10,"Red Robin is a true star in the world of tavern burgers.  With so many burgers to choose from, I opted for the seasonal Oktoberfest burger which comes with black forest ham, swiss cheese, sauteed onions and beer mustard on top of a pretzel bun. It took a while to come, but it really was worth the wait. I'm really picky about my burgers, but let me say these guys know how to cook a burger. Extremely juicy, tender and packed with flavor you'd think the other ingredients would have overpowered the burger, but nein! The pretzel bun was kind of cool to look at but it didn't really taste much like a pretzel. A bit lacking in salt in my opinion. Still a solid 4 out of 5 for the burger. The sweet potato fries were really moist, but not soggy like many I've had before. Good call on the substitution Mike! My only regret at Red Robin is that I didn't leave enough room for the Sam Adams milkshake. I'm still training my stomach to stretch a little further.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-amherst?start=60,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003

So I emailed my father Jim, and asked him to call my brother Jimmy to see if the three of us could all get together for a free burger at Red Robin. Yes, my father named two children after himself, but with different mothers so that makes it OK. Actually, the mothers both had the same name too. Maybe that is weird. Anyhow... We started with a tower of THE most amazing onion rings, served with sides of ranch and a fantastic honey mustard dipping sauce. That appetizer was $9/$10(?). Kind-of a lot for onion rings perhaps but these really were incredible. Of course, we all got the Sweet Jim Beam Bacon Swiss Burger. The sauce was extremely good. But my father and I ordered ours done medium and what we got was medium-well; no trace of pink at all. Also, considering the regular price of the burgers they were average size; not as huge as I had heard. Note: If you are into endless fries, theirs are bottomless.  Overall we had a great time and the service was fine. I can just think of plenty of other places for a larger and just as tasty of a burger at a better price, ya know...when they are not free :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-amherst?start=40,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003

87,Adam Y.,"Tampa, FL",2,64,,2.0,2013-04-22,"Visiting from out of town and went to Red Robin on Maple as my family had always wanted to try it.  The place is very clean and attractive with lots of TV's and a nice atmosphere.  After getting seated we studied the menu for a good 10 minutes before anyone showed up to take our drink order.  By then we knew what we wanted but our server just went quickly to grab the drinks.   The menu has a lot of burger choices, along with chicken sandwiches, salads and a few specials.  It requires a bit of studying, because they like to have cutesy names for their items, but ultimately it isn't too hard to find something. We ordered burgers with fries although one of us tried the fried chicken sandwich..  The restaurant was not crowded at all (this was Monday around 12:30) but it took a long time to get our food.   I wasn't sure why, but when it arried we could see the much publicized fries were a bit soggy, undercooked and quite frankly not appealing.  Given how long it took to order and receive our food, we just decided to keep them. Because one of the burgers was dripping with bbq sauce, we quickly asked for additional napkins.   We ate our meals and our server apparently just forgot.  He came back (long overdue) to offer us drink refills and inquire if we wanted more fries but by then all we wanted was our napkins and a check. The burgers and fried chicken sandwich were both excellent.  Their was no disagreement about that.  None of us liked the fries and while our server was very nice, he clearly didn't distinguish himself or the restaurant.   We all agreed that this was a one time event.  There are too many other places locally where we can get a burger equally as good and get better service. I could have give this 3 stars to be nice, but quite frankly the 2 star rating says ""Meh I've experienced better"" while 3 stars is 'A-OK"".  Baaed on these descriptions, 2 stars sums up our experience exactly.   It was nothing special and given that I am out of town, I wish we had just taken the easy way our and went to Ted's (or Andersons for that matter).  That would have been a better 'Buffalo' experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-amherst?start=80,2.536,2.536,2.536,2.536,2.536
50,Lindsay A.,"Buffalo, NY",375,987,403.0,3.0,2013-07-20,"I've been here so many times, I'm surprised that I've never written a review yet.  Came here for late lunch with my mom and sister today. We were told our wait would be 5 minutes though there were several vacant tables. We're seated about 30 seconds later... Umm okay... Everything seems slightly dirty and old. Not as fresh as I remember it being. My sister ordered a grilled chicken meal, I ordered a grilled chicken salad, and my mom ordered a turkey BALT on a croissant. My iced tea was totally diluted. Barely tasted the tea. Then we waited... And waited... And waited for our meals.  When the food finally came, my sister's meal was ice cold. And it was just 2 grilled chicken breasts and fries, not what she was expecting, nor what the menu detailed. We told the waitress and she sent the meal back. Manager came out a few minutes later with a basket of hot fries for her and apologized. My sister asked if they could box her meal since we had been there for so long and she didn't feel like waiting anymore. They did and apologized. When we got the bill, her meal was still on it, but the manager came over and said he would take that off of the bill. Good thing!  I'm pleased with the way they handled the snafu, but I'm disappointed that was my  sister's first experience with Red Robin! She is a picky eater to begin with and doesn't often like to give places second chances, especially if her experience was bad! I'm pretty sure she won't be returning... :(  The best advice I can give about Red Robin is to order a burger or chicken sandwich. That's what they do best! Salads and other meals are never a sure thing and really are not that great there. I usually get the California Chicken Burger and it is so good! My mom's turkey BALT was SUPER tasty.

I was surprised there was actually people given the time and day, but for me that's a good sign. We were greeted fairly quickly by the hostess who took us to a large sized booth instead of one of those tiny ""2 person"" booths that are made for children, bonus points right there already. Our server asked us if we had been before (which I had not) and she happily briefly explained what Red Robin was all about and asked for our drink order. I ordered pop, and my girlfriend ordered a beer. She proceeded to ID my girl but not me, which in my mind is the right thing to do. She brought back our drinks (the beer took about 3-5 minutes longer than my pop) and then we ordered. Our food arrived approx. 15 minutes later. I ordered the Royal Red Robin burger which has cheese, bacon, and a ""fried"" egg (everything a growing boy needs). The burger was big enough that I needed to cut it in half. I was surprised that the yolk started running when I cut into the burger, but I'm fine with that I actually prefer a runny egg on my burger and to dip my fries in (I'm gross, I know). The burger was quite good to my surprise, I'd put it up there with Chili's as far as a chain restaurant goes for a burger. My girl ordered a burger with pineapple on it (can't remember the name) but she enjoyed it as well. The fries were just ok in my opinion, but then again I'm not a huge fan of steak fries. I think when I come here the next time I'll opt for the sweet potato fries.

I gave it two stars for the bottomless strawberry lemonade and our server who, even on a Friday evening during happy hour, kept a smile on her face and made us feel important to her.

The one bright shinning moment of the dinner was the onion ring tower, it was hot and delicious and the sauce that came with it was awesome. I was expecting something along the lines of a blooming onion sauce but it was more of a smokey BBQ sauce. I ordered some fancy smancy lemonade drink which albeit girly was delicious and I recommend getting it! If you do, get a glass of water on the side because it is pretty sweet. One major problem was the waitresses do not make the drinks themselves they have to put it into a system and have the bar do it which slows the process down greatly.After the tower and drinks the expectations for the meal were high to say the least but boy did that not last long. the food took a very long time to come out and when it did it was luke warm. The sweet potato fries practically had ice on them and the person I was with had a mushroom burger with both the burger and mushrooms being cold and bland. I myself had the southern charm burger which was decent, it had brown sugar-glazed half-pound Black Angus beef patty, candied bacon, house-made honey BBQ sauce, extra-sharp Cheddar, seared red onions, lettuce and mayo served on a toasted ciabatta bun.

Our server was so sweet and friendly.  She bonded with our son right away and knew exactly how to interact with him (she has a son around the same age).  She is so great at what she does and I hope she continues to work in the customer service industry because she really is an asset to any business.   The atmosphere here is super comfortable.  The lights are dim, the booths are comfortable and well-maintained, and the noise level is usually just right. The food is completely customizable- you can tell them exactly how you want your burger, sandwich, and sides, and they are more than accomodating.   ATTENTION VEGETARIANS:  Yes, this is a burger joint- and guess what-  ANY recipe can be made with a veggie burger or vegan burger.  They will substitute it for no extra charge.  Yes!!  (Being a newer vegetarian, I was thrilled that I could still order my favorite Whiskey River BBQ burger with a veggie patty- it tasted awesome, by the way.)

Do you know where the 1st Red Robin place was? Seattle. Fun fact for you. We got hooked on Red Robin when we lived out there. It's a nice chain.  My husband loves the burgers. I'm not really a burger person, but they have a lot of other things on the menu I like. They have a salad with chicken fingers in it, that's pretty good. They have a Prime Rib french dip, that's also pretty good. Today I had a BLTA Croissant, that was also very good.   They make a lot of tasty alcoholic beverages and what I really like about them is they have the prices for them on the menu. Have you ever noticed that before, how a lot of restaurants don't like to list the prices for alcoholic beverages? I do and it annoys me. So I like that Red Robin is upfront with prices for booze.   Today we started with the chips with salsa and guacamole. It's $5 and I wouldn't get it again. You get the smallest, tiniest little cups of salsa and guac for that price. We ate it all before I could take a picture.  We also finished with the Mile High Ice Cream Pie thing. It reminded me of Hula Pie, which is a common ice cream pie in Hawaii. I like the one at Duke's in Maui the best, it has macadamia nut ice cream. The Red Robin ice cream pie was pretty decent though. It's vanilla and chocolate ice cream, with a ice cream cake fudge-y stripe between. The plate was covered in caramel and I thought it went really good with the ice cream.  They have those fancy little things on the table now to order more drinks, apps and desserts. Also to pay your bill. The waitress of the future.  Service is always okay to good, never any problems there. I like that I know we can eat here in an hour or less so we can get to movies on time.

There are so many burger options, endless fries, and say you'll try the freckled lemonade (they have an adult version, too).  My most recent visit I tried out the newer item, Marco Pollo sandwich with grilled chicken. It was very juicy and flavorful, but nothing outdoes my fav, the banzai burger.  They've renovated the interior and it looks better than ever. They added classy glass walls around the center booths that act as sound barriers. Before the restaurant was an entire open space; the noise has noticeably cut down. They've also added tvs, which are pretty standard in American restaurants nowadays. I appreciate the no sound so they aren't too distracting from enjoying family time. Also have the screens at the table to place orders and pay your bill. Neat feature, but folks needing reading glasses: don't leave the specs in the car!  I've been here numerous times and staff has always been pleasant. Definitely recommend for families, fun date nights, and parties.  Four stars because endless fries are great, but wish the initial serving was a bit more for how much prices have increased over the past few years.

French dip for her, Whiskey River BBQ wrap for me. Food took a while to arrive and when it did it was by another server (no problem). My wrap was ice cold. My wife's meal included coleslaw as well as fries. the amount of coleslaw on her plate was barely more than 2 tines on a fork. The fries were hot but not plentiful. Our server finally came back to check on us and I asked if my wrap was supposed to be hot..she said yes. I told her it was ice cold. I could see where the cheese was melted at one point (must have been made earlier in the day), She offered to make me a new one, I told her we didn't have the time as we waited long enough for a simple meal. I was hungry and would suffer through this awful meal. I couldn't finish it. She came back and asked if there was anything else, we said no, and she explained about the check on their table top machine and left. No discount on my meal.  We were paying cash and signaled her by using the machine with call server and blinking red light. We sat there with the light flashing on the machine for almost 10 minutes with all kinds of servers passing us by but not ours. Finally we paid and left.

After we spent some some time looking over the new menu I decided that I needed to give the A.I. Peppercorn burger a shot because the picture alone was making my mouth water. What's cool is when you wait for the food you actually have a tablet on the table that you can read stories or play games on with the other people at the table (It does cost $1.99 to play games). When the food itself came it looked just as good as the picture. The burger itself was topped off with bacon and lettuce and was made just right. I don't think I even need to comment on the fries, Red Robin has some really good fries and if you add that special seasoning to them, well, they become perfect.

4,Christopher C.,"Conshohocken, PA",168,1318,6419.0,2.0,2017-07-11,"Over the years I've really tried to avoid Red Robin locations especially since they went to that Ziosk nonsense which more or less became a license for your server to maroon your ass once you place your order. Our visit to this RR location played out like most of our rare visits over the past five years.  We come in and the place is fairly busy and we're quoted the same as everyone a blanket wait time of twenty minutes.  Alright whatever, we'll take it because the proximity to the hotel is very good.  Maybe thirty seconds later they call us for a table while the next group in the door gets quoted twenty minutes.  ?????? Everything regarding the service was glacially slow.  Over ten minutes to get a drink order taken.  Plenty of time afterwards to have the drinks come to the table with another large gap of time to order, etc.  To be fair in terms of the service here, our sever had a lot of tables and she was covering a lot of ground.  But to also be fair we had a good look at the bar area and she really milked it like hell each visit over there with other co-workers taking plenty of time to gab it up. Tavern Double - Mac and Cheese Tavern Double - Southern Charm - Grilled Turkey Burger More or less everything came out as expected with the exception of the Turkey Burger.  Considering the size of the actual patty it's a real rip to charge ten bucks for that thing.  It also didn't help that either the kitchen or the server screwed up the concept of light on the chipotle aioli to hold the chipotle aioli.  Oh boy!  Spoil me with a patty that had the consistency of a rubber chicken and the flavor of a throw pillow.   Now I can already hear you eternal optimists saying that I should just press the little call button on the Ziosk or to flag down a manager and my answer to you is that no management was present the entire meal and while the light on the Ziosk blinked away, nobody came for I don't know eight or nine minutes.  Nothing like lukewarm food and the rest of the your group being well into their grub while yours still isn't what you ordered.  I should also mention that after that wait a different server came to our table to ask what was up as our server was.....somewhere?  Alien abduction?  Deported?  Who knows? Eventually just to get one more up the chute for the road like several other reviews to this listing when it comes to time settle the bill naturally the Ziosk was unable to print a receipt as the only thing that happened was listening to grinding sound of the receipt paper getting stuck on itself inside the unit. I would have pushed the call button again but LOL, yeah right.  Two hours for dinner would be alright at a Melting Pot or a Ruth's Chris.  At a Red Robin that's asinine and we had already put in our fair share of waiting. Overall three of the four burgers came out as advertised which is of course a good thing.  What's not a good thing is that the current hybrid electronica-humonica system which doesn't work if your order has an issue or if you need any help after your food hits the table. Back in the day we frequented this chain more often than we do know (maybe once a year and only when we're on the road) simply because the service has gone to hell with the advent of the Ziosk which has allowed, I'm guessing here, staffing levels to be cut and/or the service angle to change from checking in to see if you need anything, i.e. being proactive, versus hoping your little blinking light on the table is noticed which is stupidly reactive.

As far as I remember, the burger was well made and I enjoyed it with my bottomless cole slaw (instead if bottomless fries). But that wasn't the best burger I've had at Red Robin. My favorite burger so far is banzai, the teriyaki sauce and grilled pineapple goes very well together and it is quite unique. I have also tried southern charm and it was great as well. My goal is to try all the burgers and I'm sure I won't be disappointed. In terms of service, I've always gone with a group of friends (10+ people) and the service was always top notch. We would have two waiters/waitresses taking our orders instead of just one. This is great for both the customers and the waiter/waitress. They're not bombarded by a million orders and are able to attend to less customers, while the customers can enjoy more attentive service and shorter wait time.

Nothing irritates me more than, (because I have gray hair), being treated like I'm a stupid old person (of which I am neither). The server could not have been put out more after finding out we were there for the birthday burger. After placing our order the food took about 25 minutes to get to the table (for 2 burgers and fries).  We had purchased 2 soda waters at 2.99 each. When I asked for a refill, I was given plain water. The server walked several times past our table, purposely ignoring my attempts to flag her down. When it came time to pay, I was directed to the Zoisk. The server quickly ran through the process of payment, showing how to remove the birthday burger from the bill then quickly disappeared. As I stepped through what I had been shown, I was presented with the screen to sign if I approve of the amount. It was at that point I waited for the server to return. Five minutes later she did and I asked what I did wrong. She proceeded to sign the kiosk by drawing a line and hit submit. She then said it was too late to remove the price of the free burger because I HAD APPROVED THE BILL and that the offer was good for another month, I could come back. At that point I already knew I would never be going back.  Two burgers, and 2 soda waters, plus a tip, $37.00.  So after some back and forth, I was told that the first charge would come off my charge in 3 to 5 days.

I got it but then I asked for a little bit more because I ran out and the MANGER came over and said you know we're gonna have to charge you 1.00 for extra cheese. And I was thinking in my head are you kidding me I'm paying money for my food you don't tell me this. UNEXCEPTABLE. If customer service would like to post me back I would love that. I am so disappointed. And I will never be back ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-amherst,3.08,3.08,3.08,,3.0800000000000005
1,Jillian R.,"Buffalo, NY",154,195,110.0,2.0,2018-01-08,"Downgrading this review after 2 recent, very poor experiences with the service.  Every time I go in they attempt to sit me in the bar area which is near the door--well, it's Buffalo in January and it's cold everytime the door opens. I don't want to sit there while I'm eating. Further, every time I've sat in the bar area the service is poor because the bartender is also my server.  The most recent visit I went in and was about to be seated at the bar again- I asked the hostess if I could sit elsewhere and she gave me the old eye roll and made it seem like I had asked her to move a mountain. I also have had a problem with meal pacing- I order an appetizer and an entree, I still expect the appetizer to come out significantly before the rest of the meal as the name ""appetizer"" implies. I don't want it all together.  To avoid this problem, I end up being full of instructions on the entire visit and it's just not enjoyable. ""Please don't sit me at the bar. Please don't put my entree in at the same time as my appetizer."" It's more cognitive load than I want to impart for a dinner experience that is supposed to be relaxing. I get that it's not a fine dining establishment, but we need some standards here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-amherst,3.12,3.3,3.3,,3.2280000000000006
3,Lisa C.,"Grand Island, NY",22,33,,3.0,2018-01-12,"This was my second visit to this restaurant and most likely my last. I came here with my daughter because online it said they had burgers for $6.99. When you get into the restaurant the menu says starting at $6.99. I ended up spending with tip $40 for my 2 burgers and two soft drinks. Our burgers were delicious cooked perfect however we got maybe six french fries each with the burgers and they weren't cooked all the way through, they were hard . One good thing, our waitress was very attentive and friendly but the place wasn't busy at all, we went around 430 in the afternoon. She was also the bartender as they seated us in the bar I guess I could've asked for a different seat but the hostess wasn't real friendly we must've waited a good three minutes when we came in for someone to even notice we were standing there to be seated.  Then one of the waiters came into the bar area and was complaining to the hostess who was in there chatting with the bartender, that no one was being seated in his area. It seemed the bar area was where all the employees came to bitch and take their breaks as there was two girls sitting right across from us at the bar eating, chatting with the bartender and they all worked there. We did get a second serving of fries each however this was sparingly and they also were half cooked. When we left I took 1/2 my burger home and I stopped the waiter who was in the bar area again and asked him for a bag and he told me sure, when he didn't come back and we saw him walking around chatting with other people over by the kitchen I asked the bartender if we could have a bag and she said ""they're at the desk when you leave want me to get you one?""-I got it myself on our way out. They were starting to get very busy. I gave them three stars because the burgers were delicious I think they should give more fries and I think they should be cooked all the way through like I said ours were half raw. I also think for what we got it was very expensive  and I don't think employees should be hanging out in the bar area chatting about their problems with work and complaining to each other in front of customers, which is why we won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-amherst,3.16,3.28,3.28,,3.2320000000000007
