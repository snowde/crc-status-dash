This is your typical chain so the food is always gonna be the same 98% of the time. Their SWEET POTATO FRIES are the bomb, so much better than your average fries. The service is good for the most part, I will admit that sometimes they keep you waiting on stuff, like they did our ticket for a good 10 minutes. Make sure you tell them if you have a time limit.

It is usually crowded as it is a chain restaurant and it can get loud at times but the atmosphere is still friendly.

They do forget sometimes, but it was just for lemon for my water, which she bought be a lot afterwards. Not the end of days because of that.  And did a guy just give this place 3 stars because they don't have a military discount? Seriously? There are a bunch of other places that don't give one. How about you go to Fridays to get your measly 5% off your meal? You lowered their rating because they didn't give you, what, $1.00 off your check? We appreciate you for signing a contract saying that you will protect the country...we show it by you having BAH, along with your pay that us taxpayers are giving you (where did you think the government get their money from?) but you down an establishment because you couldn't get back the dollar that we gave you in the first place?

Service was bad that day. I understand it was around dinnertime, but servers should at least be around to ask how well things are going, or even be in the area.

43,Mike S.,"Eagle River, AK",0,16,,4.0,2013-10-01,We used to come here before kids and we come here now with kids and they just have a really good burger. I used to get the Banzai burger all the time but now the Blue Ribbon burger is my favorite. Fries are good and service ranges from OK to Good. The volume in there is loud. So without kids we didn't care about kids around because overall it was loud enough to drown things out. Now with kids it is nice if occasionally they get loud it isn't a big deal (anything beyond something really quick my kids are out of there not tolerated behavior in public). Negatives: At times slow servers - we usually counter this with pre-requesting items like can you give us the bill when we get the food. Other negative is sometimes other people bring the food and it is like they aren't authorized to get you anything else like the bbq sauce you had requested. Also we are typically not asked about getting more fries. Not a big deal as we would say no but it is part of their selling point. Will definately be back,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-anchorage?start=40,3.216,3.216,3.216,3.216,3.2160000000000006

25,Gretchen A.,"Anchorage, AK",1,60,5.0,4.0,2014-04-25,"I stopped going to RR years ago because their burgers were always salty/overcooked and there was nothing new on the menu. My partner was craving a burger yesterday and I reluctantly acquiesced  to splitting one at RR. To my delight, they have come out with the ""signature"" burger series and we tried the DGB. It was delicious! This time they cooked it to perfection, just as requested, a little pink in the middle. Juicy, fresh, and hot - hit the spot.  I think they can improve upon the burger by toasting the ciabatta bun, just my opinion. We upgraded to the sweet potato fries and our server, Brian, promptly gave us a refill upon seeing we were getting low. We went early on a Thursday evening, when it was not so crowded/noisy - about 5:30pm. That may have contributed to the prompt service and hot food. I am deducting a star because I think $14.29 is a bit steep for a burger, so not such a good value, even in Alaska. RR knows they will get  customers so they can charge high prices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-anchorage?start=60,3.184,3.184,3.184,3.184,3.184
61,Shawn G.,"Anchorage, AK",1,7,,2.0,2014-04-26,"Very disappointing visit yesterday. Restaurant was busy and we were told there would be a 15-20 minute wait. Not a problem but then this happened... When our name was called another party cut line, lied about their name and even thought two of three hostesses doing the seating knew this was wrong. Unbelievably they still were given our table! Their lie allowed them to cut in front of us and two other parties on the waiting list ahead if them. When we informed the hostess of what happened the girl taking names blamed the girl doing the seating who in turn blamed the third hostess. When we asked the manager about the mixup. She apologized but initially did nothing.  Instead she had the girl who sat the line cutting party ask them to get up and they being the very rude people they were refused to get up.  Adding to that their server rushed to their table even though it was known as I said and reminded the manager 3 parties were jumped by these people. The manager went to the kitchen to hide and to I assume figure out what to do. When she approached  us and we asked her what her plan was to fix the situation. She said they had the entire staff looking for a table. And it wasn't their policy to ask patrons to leave tables or the restaurant.   When we complained further another manager flipped two free appetizer coupons at us and also said free drinks. In all honesty the line jumper should have been kicked out and our meal should have been free.  (And no I never look for a situation to complain to get a free meal) I understand the manager's hands were somewhat  tied. However making a hostess do your dirty work and then make excuses is not acceptable. When finally seated the waitress was phenomenal! She suggested the most expensive appetizers and drinks for our trouble. At the end  the manager brought two pieces of cheesecake.   Food was passable but the initial incident probably jaded our opinions.  I would suggest if you really want Red Robin go to the Dimond location, never had an issue there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-anchorage?start=20,2.8880000000000003,2.8880000000000003,2.8880000000000003,2.8880000000000003,2.888000000000001
49,Lara J.,"New York, NY",12,172,52.0,4.0,2014-05-29,"We were craving burgers so it was off to Red Robin for dinner. They have a new computer screen thingy at the table that lets you request your server, pay your check, order drinks, appetizers and desserts. You can also play games on it for $1.99 flat fee. It was kind of neat- the husband ordered a bottomless root beer float partway through our meal.  Our server was amazing. She kept the root beer floats coming and encouraged us to share! Are we still in Alaska??? I also noticed that if I didn't want bottomless fries, I could get a salad, cole slaw, steamed veggies, fruit or something else I can't remember for NO CHARGE! And they were also bottomless. She was also very honest when we asked which burger she recommended: the Fiery Ghost burger or the D.G.B. She said the D.G.B. cost more and didn't come with cheese and she thought the Fiery Ghost to be a better bet. Wait. Was this a server in Alaska not trying to upsell every second?? This is a place that would have my business again and again. Our burgers were fantastic and my freckled lemonade always full. We didn't use the screen to play any games (dinner time is family time, no screens allowed) but I like the option to use it, especially dining solo. I would almost venture a guess and say this may have been the best sit-down restaurant experience we've experienced since living here. Amazing service? Check. Great food? Check. No scamming for up charges? Check. Actually, no check just yet. We will stay for dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-anchorage?start=40,3.152,3.152,3.152,3.152,3.152

I ordered a Keep It Simple with a vegan burger that came in a different set up. Unfortunately the patty was not cooked well and the accompaniments were lacking. My friend ordered a signature burger that came on a ciabatta roll, and he said it was okay, but not as good as some of the ole standbys. We had a good time, and service was decent.

It was a busboy that had to give us a menu and showed us to our table. When I told him we preferred a booth, he seemed a bit upset. I figured it wasn't a problem since he must be pulling double duty, but there were many tables available. It was not busy at all for a 3pm Monday crowd. The server was nice and took our order right away. Our drinks got to us quickly as did our onion rings, which were fresh and delicious. I think it was the manager that brought us our entrees, but he seemed a bit unattentive. Maybe even somewhat rude for being the manager. The tables weren't the cleanest, the floor wasn't either, the windows were smeared, and the restroom was dirty, dark, and stinky. The cleanliness as a whole deserved a 1 star. I expect more from a food chain that we spent more than $50 (not including gratuity) for two people. One thing that surprised me was that the bartender was eating her take-out food from Carr's at the tables were paying customers eat, and the manager didn't say a word to her. As for the food, we had 2 love burgers with fries. They were luke warm and my sweet potatoes fries were toooooo salty. I understand fries are salty, but this was over the top. Even banging the salt off was insufficient. We left with a bad experience.  I have always considered Red Robin as a great place to dine.

Got there and order was wrong which was okay because the phone connection had been bad so figured she just did not hear me. When informed that it was wrong and would not mind waiting to have it redone the lady at the bar had a attitude. Decided to ignore it as maybe she was busy.

We had already read the entire menu, chosen what we wanted to order, re-read the menu to determine if we missed something better, and anxiously tried to place our order on the tablet which we were unable to do.  When our server finally arrived, she frantically took our order and disappeared again until our entrees arrived, which meant we ate our appetizer without silverware or napkins. The appetizer that we chose, the $7.00 pretzels and beer cheese sauce was decent. We just wished that it was served with more cheese sauce. We would have asked for more, but our server was MIA.  Our burgers tasted good, but were served room temperature. The fries were good, especially the garlic herbed ones, but they were the only part of our meal that was served hot. Again, we did not see our server during the time we ate our entrees, so we finished our room temperature burgers and paid on the tablet without ever seeing our server again.

Finally our drinks arrive and so do our other two friends.took another 20 mins foe them to get drinks and our refill. Finally we get our appetizer. Which was served with THE STALEST CHIPS IVE EVER BEEN SERVED. they were so stale they were chewy and could not be broken in half. Whatever we only got a tiny cup of dip anyway ? (What's up with that we pay 9 dollars and get the bare minimum?) Finally after flagging oir waitress down 3 times she comes back with refills and new chips which are just as stale.. She flirts with the two friends again and leaves and comes back with our food 40 mins later which is barley room temperature. Absolutely disappointed as this is a close establishment to the base.

As mentioned in my other review, I'm a Seattle native and grew up on RR burgers.  Just about every other restaurant I patronized has been pretty consistent.  Unfortunately, the Diamond location doesn't seem to have fixed their issues with staffing.  But this review isn't about that location.  Here's my experience with this location: I walked in and being alone, I immediately proceeded to the bar.  There were only a few tables available, but all were clean.  I grabbed a seat at one of the tall tables and within 2 minutes someone was bringing me silverware, a menu and asking me if I'd like something to drink.  ""Why, yes I would!  A Hefeweizen please!""  A few minutes later my waiter, Shane, appears and takes my order.  Everyone was very friendly.  My burger arrives in about 20 minutes.  Despite it taking me all of about 5 minutes to wolf it down, two different people came by to ask me if it was tasting alright...which, it turns out, it did.  My Banzai Burger was freaking AMAZING...as usual. I was worried that the only other RR in town might also let me down, but it didn't.  Crisis averted.  As I will be moving up to Anchorage soon, it's really nice to know that the burgers I grew up on are still available...with great service. This location is well staffed with friendly, helpful people.  The restaurant is new and clean.  Simply put, it easily lives up to what I expect from a RR franchise.  I'm not sure yet where I'll be living in Anchorage, but regardless, I will be making the drive to patronize this location.
