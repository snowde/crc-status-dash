42,Scott M.,"Owings, MD",22,55,5.0,5.0,2012-04-01,"First time at a Red Robin and was impressed with both the food and service.  The waitress (Nicole) was outstanding with a great fun personality and solid training. She walked us through the entire menu as we were new there and her follow-ups were frequent and spirited.  The food was very tasty and as ordered.  I would not normally give 5 stars to a restaurant like a Red Robin, but the service was so dead on they deserve it.  I highly recommend this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-annapolis?start=40,2.9000000000000004,2.9000000000000004,2.9000000000000004,2.9000000000000004,2.9000000000000004

Boys were very hungry and we were frazzled. Our server was very friendly and smiley, she took our orders quickly and brought everything out- she was patient with my husband too, who is addicted to the freckled lemonade and had a ton of refills. This won't be my usual long review bc, well it's Red Robin. You know what the food tastes like if you're reading this, so you already know why we go there! (It's consistent and yummy, and very kid-friendly!)  Our server came by our table several times to check on us, she brought extra plates and napkins, she brought out a basket of fries (bottomless comes with the burgers we ordered anyway) so the boys could snack on them while waiting. The food was out so fast, I was very surprised, and everything was perfect! The manager even came by to check on us before we left, and I made sure to tell her how impressed we were with the server who helped us. Awesome job!

Today this review is from  a few minutes ago. I could not WAIT to tell the world how horrible Red Robin of Annapolis Mall has become so that you all may avoid the mistake I just made in patronizing them.  I should have acknowledged the red flag of the nearly empty restaurant on a Saturday evening and left at 1st sight but we were starved & craving good burgers. Sasha or Tasha the bartender seemed preoccupied or ready to go home & quickly served us our watered down cocktails...as in I'm sure the ingredients consisted of more juice and soda than actual juice or soda would have...FAIL #1 We also ordered the Spinach dip which has reduced in portion size and flavor and tasted freezer burned. We asked Sasha or Tasha the bartender to take a break from her intense debate with her coworker over which burger they were going to order and share to bring our food we could see sitting in the kitchen window. Not very much to my surprise,  my sandwich was covered in the shredded lettuce I asked (S)Tasha to have the kitchen leave off my order but she seemed pretty consumed with ensuring the accuracy of her and her coworker's dinner order so I didn't interrupt her. The turkey burger & steak fries I've grown to love over the years was just alright & despite being an hour earlier than their closing time, I was unable to have a malt or milkshake because (S)Tasha decided to clean & break down the ice cream machine @ 10pm & let us know she likes to get an early start on her closing duties each night so she wont have to stay too late....... Great...... cause i like milkshakes... and leaf style lettuce, not shredded.

(It was a slow night according to the waiter) Their food is okay at best. Comparing to the burgers the Columbia restaurant has and even Johnny Rockets next door, it's not as good.

Cheeburger!   What a disappointment...  Red Robin's ""Gourmet"" burger is far from that. Burger King would have been better. The patty was about 1/4"" thick and tasted like it had been previously frozen. The sesame buns are oversized. I won't comment on the toppings because this time of year I don't expect much in the way of veggies. Fries were still pretty good (but could have been warmer) but the onion rings a bit tough and overbreaded. We hadn't been to RR in a couple of years because the server had been rude on our previous visit. This time the service was the highlight (and the only reason for 2 stars.)

One small group waited for the hostess in front of us.  The host walked back from the dining room and walked in between us and the party in front of us.  Didn't smile, didn't make eye contact, didn't say excuse me, did welcome us to RR.  Bad first impression. I smiled and caught her on the way to seat the party in front of us and said HELLO!  She seems startled. I'm not trying to be rude. But I have worked in hospitality for my entire career -- so, this is where my thoughts come from.  Basic customer service.  Next - the first thing our male waiter Aaron says to us ""sorry I am not a pretty girl - hope that is okay?"".  Well, sure, we are a male same sex couple of almost 19 years.  So, not an issues Aaron.  That was just an odd thing to say - period.  Our meals were very good and came out quick and hot.  We did get more fruit and fries from the bottomless offer.  Aaron, however, made another mistake by not offering more of the same and before we were even done eating brought us our check with a quick 'no rush'.  He didn't ask about dessert or coffee - a huge pet peeve of mine.  I always order coffee!  We'll be back of course but the staff needs some customer service training.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-annapolis?start=20,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003

29,Jessica H.,"Arnold, MD",1,35,10.0,1.0,2015-01-02,"This place was horrible. We will not be back ever again. We went here on 12/29 with our three kids. Our waitress was not friendly at all. She just seemed to want to do the bare minimum. My daughter spilled her drink and I had started to clean it up. The manager brought more napkins and some mildew smelling wet cloth. Absolutely disgusting.  #1) When someone is paying for a dining experience, an employee should clean the mess up. Unless one of the persons in the party offers to clean it up. I don't mind cleaning it up but the offer would've been nice.  #2) Giving out a mildew smelling wet cloth is absolutely unacceptable. It shows that the cleanliness in the restaurant is well below average.  #3) Instead of offering to get my daughter another drink the manager walked away. We had to flag down the waitress for my daughter to get another drink. Again, completely unacceptable.

28,Abby T.,"Silver Spring, MD",6,7,,1.0,2015-01-06,"Big disappointment. I've lived in the area and have visited this RR for years, but after yesterday's experience I don't think I'll be going back.  Three people in my party, we were seated right away and the restaurant really wasn't very crowded, about 2-3 tables per section.  A waitress came to our table after about a five minutes with an irritated look to tell us she wouldn't be our waitress but that she'd take our drinks since our waiter was too busy to come see us yet. Rough situation and I'm not sure why we would be seated there if the area was too busy.  We got our drinks with some attitude when an order was changed, but nothing too bad.  Then a wait for our waiter and very brusque taking of our orders, selected from the stickiest menu I've ever touched. Still not a problem that would lead me to a 1-star review. BUT, then our food arrived, not with our waiter, but another waiter. Here's where three normally very mild-mannered, easygoing restaurant-goers got very frustrated. He summarily tossed down our food and when we asked for napkins and utensils (napkins being fairly essential for sloppy burgers and utensils especially so for salads!), he said ""absolutely,"" and walked away, never to return. He even walked right past what we later discovered was the utensil area. Lovely. 15 minutes passed in which my poor father could only stare at his salad and contemplate eating it with his fingers while our burgers got cold while we didn't eat, to be polite. Surely he'd be back with utensils soon so it was no problem to wait. ha. We tried to make eye contact with other waiters, even waving at them as one might in a sinking ship. At one point all three of us were out of our booth waving at the kitchen area (with a glass wall so it's not like they couldn't see us) to try to get assistance. Our waiter and a waiter from another section worked together to take food to a table two booths from us and STILL no glance in our direction. Finally I had to go to the front of the restaurant to ask the host to go to the kitchen to get utensils for us. I can't think what kind of restaurant keeps their utensils safely out of reach from their patrons, but I suppose it is the same kind of restaurant that doesn't give them out. 25 minutes after we got our food and 10 minutes after we got tools to eat them with, our waiter came by to ask how things were. My food was undercooked, but what would be the point of saying anything, who knows how long we'd have to wait to get the rare burger closer to the well-done I'd requested. We asked for a refill on the bottomless fries, which was another long wait. We requested the check and almost immediately got the receipt, which was nice, but then the waiter completely disappeared. Apparently credit card was a non-option. Thank goodness we had cash or we may have been trapped forever. Now, I've had bad service before. Once I sat in a restaurant for so long without any service that we called the restaurant on the phone, left a message on their machine asking for the manager, got a call back, and asked him to come to our table. This was infuriating in a different, non-funny way that made us feel invisible or like we were rudely inflicting ourselves upon them.  If only Johnny Rockets were still open next door. They knew how to do a burger and make people feel welcome!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-annapolis?start=20,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.244,3.2000000000000006

Normally, they are super prompt with everything. That's why we like them, especially with a hungry kid they are a great place to go. Arrived shortly before 6 on a Friday. The place wasn't packed. We were immediately seated. Then waited almost five minutes before the server arrived. We ordered drinks and our sons meal. She came back , slowly, with drinks. Then we ordered our food. Our kid's meal came out fairly quick. The runner all but dropped in on the table. Scorching hot corndog and fries in front of little kid, bad idea. I go to cut it up and realize we don't have any utensils or plates. When the server finally comes back we ask for them. It's several more minutes before we get the utensils. Still no plate. I don't care about my kid eating off the table from a germ perspective. I want him to eat off plates because that's what you do. It takes a while for our salads to arrive. The manager, I assume, has been futzing over a very large party and our server is basically no where to be seen.  I'd been giving the manager the ""I'm so no happy"" evil eye. He finally notice as he walked around the corner of our table and asked how everything was. He got the whole story. He did promptly and sincerely apologize and took 50% off the check. I appreciate you trying to rectify the situation. But servers busting their butts just on the large groups because of the expected tips doesn't make a party of 3 feel very welcome.

Therefore, I ask at pretty much every burger joint because the one time I don't, I'll get a burger with mayo. She said there wasn't, so I ordered. When it came, surprise, surprise, there is mayo. I had to wait over 5 minutes for her to come by so I could tell her the mistake. That wasn't too bad. I munched on my fries and speckled lemonade (which were fantastic btw). Manager comes and apologizes, says they are going to make a new one. I told her it was an honest mistake. I couldn't tell by the menu which is why I asked. At that point I think the server thought she wasn't getting a tip anymore or something because I really didn't see her. They were not busy at all; the entire restaurant had maybe 5-6 covers. I get the new burger, nobody stops by. My drink sits empty, and continues to sit empty while the server flirts with a two-top of two middle-aged men (seriously, she was there for 10 minutes.. I'm not exaggerating, I timed while waiting for my drink). New burger was way overdone. Ordered medium, came out well-done. Decided to eat it anyway because I wasn't going to have my husband wait even longer for my dinner. It wasn't until 5 minutes after I finished the burger that anyone even stopped by my table. After spending all this time at the other tables, she stops by for 10 seconds asking if we want the bill. Uhm, excuse me? Both of our drinks are empty and have been empty for a while. We ask for the bill and she tells us just to use the kiosk. She was so polite and spent so much time with the other tables, but absolutely none with us. I was incredibly irritated and offended. The kicker is, the manager comes over as we were leaving and asks if everything was okay with the new burger (I think she saw me leaving comments on the kiosk). I tell her that no, the new burger was way overdone, but since nobody ever came by my table I decided to eat it. She gives me a coupon for a ""free"" $3 or $5 app on my next visit for the inconvenience. The burger was $14. It was wrong TWICE. And the service was absolutely atrocious. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was my husband's burger was done right and the fries were pretty tasty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-annapolis,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64

12,David I.,"Severn, MD",0,176,,3.0,2016-08-11,"Normally a 4 out of 5 star place, but this last time was a tad disappointing for the following reasons:  1. Cold fries- Not mine, but someone at our table.  2. Lack of fries- I ordered the steak fries. In my container there were between 5 and 10 fries total. For an ""all you can eat fries"" joint, they sure start off stingy! Our waiter was not around much even though the place was basically empty, so I ended up munching on other people's fries.  3. Like I said in #2, our waiter was pretty scarce. It was the worst when we tried to pay and leave. We sat around for an extra 20 to 30 minutes after everyone finished eating to pay the bill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-annapolis,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8

We ordered a milkshake and the waitress came and told my wife to hurry things up and pay for it to speed things up. The artichoke dip was awful, and we were never offered bottomless fries.

However all my other stars go to our waiter Andrew! Awesome! Very attentive, patient, and willing to make sure our needs were met. Nothing was rushed, he constantly checked in on us, food was brought to us in a timely manner, drinks stayed full and most of all his attitude was great! You don't see many waiters who like their job or at least show that they like it. Andrew was very laid back and mellow, very friendly. Overall great experience. My family of 6 enjoyed their lunch after a horrible experience at the picture people on the other side!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-annapolis,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
16,Michael K.,"Crownsville, MD",0,47,,1.0,2016-12-13,"Our last two visits to the Annapolis store have both resulted in very disappointing visits.  A couple of weeks ago, we visited the store.  My wife and I ordered burgers and the food came out cold.   We complained but nothing was done.    We thought we would try again.   As we were getting ready to order we asked about the 12 days of Christmas 50% Gourmet Burger promotion.  The Waiter knew nothing about it.   We showed him the email on my wife's phone and he was a little confused and did not know about the promotion.  He went to ask someone and came back and told us the gourmet burgers were 50% off and we could order the Gourmet Premium Fire and Pepper burger which I did and my wife had a gourmet tavern burger.  We asked if both burgers were included and he told us that we got 50% off both burgers.   So our food came and everything was nice.   The burgers were good but a little under cooked. When we went to pay, the 50% did not come off either burger.  We asked about it and he got his manager and explained the problem.  She went to check on it and came back and told us he was wrong we only got 1 burger at 50% but neither of the burgers we selected were eligible.   But she went ahead and gave us one of them at 50% off.  We explained that was not what the waiter told us and asked her to honor what he committed to.   She told us no and we told her that was wrong and we felt cheated.  She told us sorry that's the way it is.  We asked to speak to her manager and she told us she was the manager and we asked who she worked for and she told us Ashley and she took our number for her to call us.  Bottom line is my wife and I left the restaurant feeling cheated.  Everyone makes mistakes but its how you own them and fix the problem that matters,   In this case they let a customer leave upset for $6.   That;s really sad.  The appearance is the customer does not matter anymore at the Annapolis location and the managers do not care.   That's a shame since they have a nice restaurant.  Other locations are definitely different,.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-annapolis,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68

Bartender was either stupid lazy or ...hanging with his 2 buddies at the end of the bar.  Finished dinner and ordered 2 root brewskis only to find out 10 minutes later the machine was broken.

Then asked us to leave because one of us didn't have an ID. Then got carded again at a regular FAMILY TABLE. Which is also fine. Put in an order then the not manager came back and carded us agaaaaain saying that the rude bar tender flagged us. And claimed because some of us had different state IDs. Well obviously because it's the holidays and everyone is in their hometown visiting. This has never happened in my years of drinking all over the world. So much trouble. We spoke to the general manager and she didn't even say she'd take care of it, she just tried to defend her first bar tender even though all of our IDs are completely valid. Never coming here again. Our actual waitress was lovely though. Kudos to you girl. She's the only reason I put one star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-annapolis,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68
1,Proshun B.,"Annapolis, MD",6,110,159.0,1.0,2018-01-06,"Ok so something messed up just happened. We went in knowing Red Robin's has Veggie burger option and we were craving for one as we had before. But we noticed the Wedgie burger on the menu and somehow associated the word WEDGIE with VEGGIE and instead of confirming with the server we just went with it (again, under the assumption it is Veggie Burger). After a while they come out and  immediately notice the Bacon sticking out of the buns and we had questions Poppin in our head such as ""is this Veggie Bacon or what is the Bacon doing in the Veggie burger"". So we call the server and ask her while we are eating couple of garlic fries. Big Spoiler, the Wedgie Burger is not Veggie burger. Which marketing associate came up with this name? What is the logical meaning of a beef burger that's called WEDGIE? Is this burger supposed to be from the absolute meat of a Cow's Butt? Seriously. Anyhow, we informed the server that we did not inquire enough on the name and wanted Veggie burgers (wedgie, hello!). She take them back and returns within two minutes with burgers that supposedly on the buns we requested on  but the sight of Bacon  troubled us again. As my wife started to ask the server about the Bacon, I was more concerned about if the patties were actually changed it if they were using the same bun with meat juice in them? I just called it quits and left at this point.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-annapolis,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68
