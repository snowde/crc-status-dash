169,Jon R.,"Los Angeles, CA",711,623,1170.0,4.0,2012-01-05,"Just got back from the ""Mock Service"", for those you don't know what that is, it's a night where they invite locals to dine for free. It's usually a night filled with mistakes, meltdowns and mayhem-all of which is supposed to prepare the staff for the Grand Opening. I've eaten at Red Robin on numerous occasions throughout the years and surprisingly this was by far the best experience I've had there. Before even walking through the door I was happily greeted then shown to my table. My server Nadine was great! She was always cheery, her honesty was refreshing, and her recommendations were spot on!  I had the Royal Burger which is a juicy all-beef patty with american cheese, lettuce, tomato, a fried egg, mayo, in a sesame seed bun. I know great burgers and this was pretty okay. You could do a lot worse than you could better. The sweet potato fries however were spectacular!! Hot, fresh, and salted to perfection! They definitely put 80% of other restaurants' sweet potato fries to shame!  The ""Freckled Lemonade"" or strawberry lemonade (made with Minute Maid) was actually really good. I would order it again despite that fact that I'm not a lemonade guy.  My friend had the Riblets & Clucks, which was good. The riblet meat just fell off the bone. She also had the Oreo Shake which was undeniably great! =9 All and all, things were great here! Yes, things weren't perfect but for a mock service it was muuuuuucchhhh better than I expected.  Service: Friendly, Warm, Welcoming Food: Good, Generous, Comforting Ambiance: Bright, Fun, Lively If you're out shopping in the Santa Anita mall, and find yourself hungry, check out Red Robin.  The Cajun Cluck 'n Fries are pretty good too (if memory serves me).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arcadia?start=140,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997
280,Ivy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",1536,1308,2750.0,4.0,2012-01-14,"They just officially opened this past Monday (Jan. 9) and although the night was filled with ""mistakes, meltdowns, and mayhem"" (as Jon R. put it down below), I have to give two -- yes, TWO -- extra stars for the customer service. We went last night and the wait on a Friday night was long -- roughly 30 minutes, when we were told it was going to be 10-15 minutes.  Supposedly the hostess had called our table's name several times and when we didn't respond, they told my sister that they had taken our name off the list and we would have to wait all over again.  I spoke with the hostess instead, cleared the mistake up, and was told we would be seated next.  The manager was so kind and insisted that we order an appetizer while we were waiting so that it could be served right when we sat down.  We looked over the appetizers and nothing looked appealing so we politely declined.  She then told us since we waited so long for a table, we'd get a complimentary dessert on the house.  Sweet! We were seated and our server was so, so, so nice (unfortunately, I don't remember her name).  She quickly got our round of waters and took our orders.  The table behind us, who also had her as a server, weren't so lucky :(  As she served them drinks she spilled a couple cups over and the entire table had to get up and wait for the staff to clean the mess.  It took them a really long time to clean the mess up with towels -- why doesn't Red Robin have a mop on hand, in case for spills?  That would've resolved the issue much more quickly. As for the food, I ordered Ribs & Mac 'N Cheese combo.  I'm sick with the flu, so I could barely taste anything; but what I could taste on occasion when my sinuses momentarily cleared up, wasn't bad at all.  Oh, and I can't forget the bottomless fries!  If you order anything that has a side of fries, they're ""endless"" (free ""refills"" on fries)!  So awesome.  I also ordered their Absolut Vodka Strawberry Lemonade and was quite pleased that they put actual strawberries in it!  Refills on the water were swift as well, which was pleasantly surprising.  Our server was seriously, so friendly, accommodating, and quick on her feet. When dessert time came, I reminded our server of what the manager had told us, and she told us it was no problem.  I told her we'd like the dessert with the Chocolate Chip cookie and Vanilla Ice Cream -- and when she came back, she had two in her hands!  She told us that since we were a large party of 6, they decided to give us two on the house.  SWEET. I understand since they just opened and are prone to a lot of mistakes, they have to make it up with comp'd appetizers and desserts; so this may not always be the case as their business continues.  However, considering how there weren't any huge mistakes with our party and experience (only that we had to wait a long time for our table), what Red Robin did to make up for it was more than enough! I would definitely come again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arcadia?start=280,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997

358,Luther C.,"Arcadia, CA",210,50,35.0,1.0,2012-01-16,"I will not be coming back.  First, yes endless fries sounds great, but seriously, its not that great. Their special seasoning tastes funky on the fries- too many flavors clashing. Their icecream is one-note with a lack of vanilla flavor; it tastes industrial. It tastes like they bought a gallon of it for $2. The burgers are mediocre, over-priced, and unsatisfying. I ordered the Royal Red Robin Burger, known for the burger with a fried egg inside. That excites me. Damn, I love it when I bite into a burger and experience that golden treat that just runs down the sides of the burger which marries all the flavors together... That's not what I received at Red Robin. My egg was fully cooked, when I specifically asked for the yolk to be runny. Once the egg is fully cooked, it adds nothing special to the hamburger. They screwed up on the most crucial part of the burger, the one unit that makes that burger special, the egg. My friend ordered the Bacon Burger and ate 1/4 of it before he gave up and told me it was disgusting. By the way, we were quite hungry as well, and we're not nit-pick eaters. I'll give them props for the appetizer of fried mushrooms and fried zucchini, however, the serving was way too small and it was definitely over priced. If you want fried zucchini, go to Jim's. If you want fried mushrooms, go to Everest in La Canada. Its worth it, but this is not. Btw, I got food poisoning after my meal and had to immediately use their restroom. (I also asked for the patty to be fully cooked, but was disappointed again with pinkness). My other friend ordered a burger with mushrooms - they were extremely sad. They were like... boiled... or ""sauteed"" in water. No caramelization on the mushrooms to bring out that natural steak flavor... Again disappointed. Spent 17$ on a bad root beer float, a couple scraps of fried mushroom and zucchini, a bland medium sized burger, and a side of fries...  There are a few things that I would compliment them on - nice service. However since it is new, it seems a little over-done with the ""HEY WELCOME TO REEEED ROBINNN!"" Its too fake. But anyway, the service was decent. The waiter spilled 7 cups of water as he handed it to our table, but a team was joined to quickly recover the mess. I don't mind the water spill too much since the restaurant is somewhat new, however it was pretty awkward. The bathrooms were nice and clean, but again, its a new restaurant. It better be clean. The ambiance is nice. Casual. Good for big groups. They separated the check for us which is always a nice thing for them to do.  Giving a 1-Star to a restaurant means I would not come back. It also means with the money given, I could have cooked a MUCH better meal. It also means I must have left feeling sickly, jipped, and turned-off.  I hope that this review would not destroy their business but in fact make it better. Hopefully one of the workers or managers would come across this and find it as constructive criticism.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arcadia?start=320,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002
302,Clement L.,"Arcadia, CA",546,7,,3.0,2012-01-17,"Friendly service, mid-range prices, endless fries. The food's not great, but at least you're guaranteed to get filled up on the endless fries or drinks. Just be asian and share one order of drinks/fries with a few people - I reckon it's justifiable, given the prices. Most of the food is pretty bland, and honestly, it's like eating at a higher calibre McDonald's but you're paying twice the amount. It also worries me that I went opening week and it still didn't blow me away; imagine what it's like on a normal, run-of-the-mill weekend. I agree with Luther that some of the servers are overdoing it. On leaving the store, one worker dragged out a ""Thank you for coming to Reddddddddddddd Robinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnns,"" just like that, and then snickered afterwards. Really professional, guys.

289,Andrew F.,"Los Angeles, CA",101,457,41.0,2.0,2012-01-19,"Being that this Red Robin location is new, many things should be expected and many things should be forgivable. Unfortunately, the errors and experiences that my party/family and I encountered on our visit here warranted the 2-star rating I am about to write. Long said short, they had some inexperienced servers on staff [actually, just the server that was assigned my party], that lacked sensitivity, awareness, and presence to the customers.  Three of us ordered the Strawberry Lemonade and when all 3 drinks were drained, one of us asked for refills. The server brought back just one cup, while the other two remained empty. The server also neglected removing the empty cups and it wasn't until there were 6 empty cups of Strawberry Lemonade remnants on our table that ANOTHER server came by and picked up after our server. We asked for Tabasco sauce a total of 4 times before we finally got it. We had to ask other servers on 3 separate occasions to locate our server for us because he would be gone for extended periods of time. We ordered 6 entrees and had to wait 30 minutes for 4 out of 6 entrees to arrive at the table. The 5th order was wrong and was asked to be sent back, while the 6th entree was missing in action. It took them an additional 20 minutes on top of the 30 we had already waited for the final entree to show. It just so happens that the 6th entree belonged to my diabetic father, who does not have the luxury of waiting around for food that gets inexplicably delayed when his blood sugar level is not right. Management had stepped in and tried to correct things, such as taking $50 off our tab [greatly appreciated] and offering us free dessert [we were too full.. either from the food or from the hot air of frustration.. I wasn't sure], but it was a bit too little too late. Upon leaving, the staff gave us a survey to fill out online, which I gladly did. I received a call from management two days later and they offered to send me a $50 gift card to give them a second chance. I was already planning on giving Red Robin in Arcadia a second shot because I like fries and bottomless fries is my doom. With regards to the food, I ordered the chophouse burger which was supposed to have horseradish mayo, fried onions and mushrooms on top of swiss. The meat on the burger was a little dry and had absolutely no flavor to it. There was no juiciness, no flavor in the meat, and the taste of the toppings and sauce between the buns did NOT blend with the burger. I was pretty disappointed. The fries that came with the first wave of entrees were lukewarm to cold, which made us even more upset. When management had taken notice that our server was being less than.. 'serviceful', our fries magically appeared freshly fried, hot, and crispy, and our drinks were refilled almost immediately. But again, a little too little too late. If you come to this RR, be forewarned that they'll need a few more weeks to work out their kinks and to weed out their bad servers from their good ones. I will be back just one more time - hopefully to a better experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arcadia?start=280,2.504,2.504,2.504,2.504,2.504

314,Steve H.,"Los Angeles, CA",111,61,,2.0,2012-01-30,"My girlfriend and I went to this Red Robin on 1/29/12 for lunch.  To sum the experience up, I'd say ""chaos & confusion.""  When we sat down, a young lady came up, identified herself as our server and took our drink order.  Then a guy came up and identified himself as our server.  Then a third person, another young lady, came up and identified herself as our server.  Then the 2nd server, the guy, came back and said he was really our server and sorry for the confusion. We ordered some appetizers, these jalepeno bottle caps and fried mushrooms.  We also split a burger which we wanted ""as rare as you can make it"" and with sweet potato fries.  After we put in the order, the waiter came up and said he was no longer our waiter and that the 3rd server we met at the beginning was now our new server.  Great. We got the appetizers and there were 40 jalepeno bottle caps and 4 mushrooms.  Just 4.  Very off-balanced.  Then we got our burger, which not only was cooked well done, but had regular fries.  We told the waitress it was wrong and she went back to the kitchen.  Then a manager came by and told us they overcooked the 2nd burger as well.  We finally got the burger after 3 attempts and it was average, at best.   When we wanted the check the waitress said the manager had the ticket, she couldn't find him, so she couldn't bring us the bill.  Really?   Oh, I almost forgot - during the time we were waiting for the check, I got up to use the restroom and server #2 (the guy) stopped me and asked ""Can I help you sir?""  I didn't realize that going to the restroom was suddenly strange behavior for someone at a restaurant.   After all of this, did they offer to comp our drinks or appetizers or get a free dessert?  No.  Nothing.  Needless to say we won't ever go to that Red Robin again, or probably any other one.  We can get much better burgers at half a dozen other places without the headache.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arcadia?start=300,2.408,2.408,2.408,2.408,2.4080000000000004

339,Jodi B.,"Monrovia, CA",67,7,,1.0,2012-02-20,"My husband and I have enjoyed Red Robin for many years. When the Arcadia location opened up we went in to try it. The first time we were there, the food was decent and the service attentive, but today was a nightmare.  We were seated in one of the booths in the bar area. The restaurant was very busy, so we sat down at a table that had not yet been cleared. We waited 10 minutes and asked on 2 separate occasions to have the table cleaned.  Once the waitress took our drink order, we waited another 10 minutes for her to come back and take our lunch order. We ordered an appetizer and a chicken sandwich. Needless to say, this waitress must have never waited on tables before. We watched other people being seated, ordering and getting their food and we still were waiting for our appetizer. After 30 minutes, we still had no appetizer. FINALLY, we receive only HALF of the appetizer order. We ordered sweet potato fries and fried zucchini. The sweet potato fries come out somewhat cold, like they had been sitting up on the counter for a while. The waitress goes back to get the zucchini and delivers the zucchini and it's dripping in grease. It was super  gross!  There literally was a puddle of grease at the bottom of the basket.  We were so hungry, we ate the appetizers and another 20-25 minutes went by and still no main course. We only ordered one chicken sandwich, how hard can it be?  When I saw a couple sit down at the bar and served their food within 10 minutes, still not having received our main course, that was it.  We had seen several tables come and go since we had been sitting there and still had no food.  I told my husband I was over it and wanted to leave. It took another 5-10 minutes just to get our waitresses attention so we could tell her to forget it. When she came back with the bill, she said that the manager had comped the meal.  My question......WHAT MEAL?  We had a appetizer, that was already comped through Red Robins Club and. $2.50 iced tea. So basically, they comped my iced tea.  Then the waitress blamed the problem on the kitchen staff. She stated that one of the cooks called in sick and they were short staffed. To me, that was no excuse.  An experienced waitress should be aware of their tables and if their customers have been served what they ordered. She walked by our table about 10 times and should have noticed that we had not received our order and should of asked the cooks, where the food was for our table. The staff is horribly inexperienced and the managers are even worse. I think Red Robin corporate needs to do a drop by and see how this place is being run. I don't think I will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arcadia?start=340,2.436,2.436,2.436,2.436,2.436

But, my boyfriend has never tried and Red Robin's endless fat fries are a right of passage; so, we headed on over.  The service was stellar! Didn't have a problem. But, the table next to us was looking for their server 75% of the time.  The only docking of stars for me is the food. I mean maybe I deserve it because I ordered a SALAD at Red Robin but I was just throughly unimpressed with their salad dressing. Their balsamic vinaigrette was awfully tangy but not in the sour-y way. I'm not sure how to explain it but it just didn't taste right.  But, the main attraction was perfectly cooked. The fries were PIPING HOT which also meant that my-hasty-self burnt the roof of my mouth. That's a first for me - burning the roof of my mouth by eating fries. But, delicious!

It was like a salad...very messy. Taste-wise it was okay, though I remembered red robin's being better than that a few years ago. The beef patty was covered in sauce, so I really couldn't taste it... bottomless fries: Not as ""crispy on the outside, soft/fluffy on inside"" as I remember either. Doused the suckers in a ton of red robin's seasoning...it was also super oily. I think I didn't like the taste of the oil that they used for frying.  Overall, it was just a meh. Average at best, but lacks very much in terms of flavoring. I will give it another try...maybe it was just that day or my experience being soured by the loud complaining lady behind me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arcadia?start=160,2.54,2.54,2.54,2.54,2.54

When me and my girlfriend sat down, we looked at the menu, and I told her what I wanted and for her to order for me if the server comes. I went to the restroom, and when I came back, the server did come. After after my girlfriend order the cheese sticks for our starter, the server left and didnt come back for a long time. When he finally came back, he stood away while asking us what we wanted. Shouldnt he be standing closer and in between us? But besides that, right after we told him which burger we wanted, he left. I had to wait a long time again before he came back, in order to get some ranch and honey mustard sauce.  Throughout the time we were eating, he never came back to check on us. We saw him goofing around in the kitchen area with a female co worker instead. Seeing how they offer bottomless fries, I asked for another batch, but when it was brought over, it was really soggy. Seems like it was old fries.  I then remember that they offer you a free burger on your birthday month. So I told the server that. And he asked if I wanted a birthday sundae. I said sure. After he came with the check, I paid. But I never received my changed back. I was going to leave the rest as tip anyways, but for him NOT to bring it back was really annoying to me.  We waited a few minutes for the ice cream sundae to come. But it never came. About 15 minutes later, I was able to flag the server down and asked him about the sundae. He said ""OH!!!""  He forgot my ice cream. Im not a big fan of sweets, but the fact that he offered me a sundae and forgot to bring it. And the face that my change was never brought back to me. I will never come back to this place ever again!! Oh yeah, our server's name was Thomas. Just in case someone on here gets him.

I recently came here twice this year.  Once was with friends.  At that time, our server was friendly but he was a bit absent for awhile.  It was hard to track him down just so we could get our refills of our freckled strawberry lemonade or even get our free appetizer (from joining Red Royalty).  Service at that time wasn't great.  It was a Sunday night and it was actually pretty crowded!   I don't know why but I think I was trying to be healthy so I ordered a salad, which was just ok. The 2nd time I came here, I really enjoyed it!  I joined Red Royalty card and they give you a free burger for your birthday.  You have the whole month of your birthday to use up the free burger.  Mine was expiring in 5 days so hubby and I came here on a Monday night.  Not crowded at all. I got the A1 peppercorn burger and it was delicious!!!  It's a huge burger and comes with applewood smoked bacon, crispy onion rings, peppercorns.  It was delicious and peppery and the burger didn't even need any ketchup because it was flavorful.  It is a huge burger so it kinda sits in your stomach for awhile since it's pretty heavy.  Comes with bottomless fries - but we didn't get 2nds or 3rds.  One was enough!  The burger seriously sits heavily in your stomach so no room for more fries! Hubby got some shrimp tacos and he said it was ok.  He liked my burger better. Our server was nice and attentive.  He even brought me my 2nd refill of my freckled strawberry lemonade without my asking!  He checked up on us, too.  Granted, it was a Monday night and not a Saturday night.  But I thought he was efficient and friendly. Strawberry freckled lemonade is yummy!  Sweet and tangy with real pieces of strawberries.  Free refills! I would love to come back to try the other burgers!  Or maybe just order the peppercorn burger again.  Yum!

They have a great selection of burgers and of course your bottomless fries which can do you no wrong whatsoever especially if you're a potato head like me. FOOD = 3 Stars: It's pretty average and there's nothing that jumps out in my mind that says I want to go to Red Robin. The portions are huge if you do enjoy that. However, I always feel like I'm going to explode when I'm done eating. That's beside the point, but the quality of the food is still under the 3 stars range. ATMOSPHERE = 3 Stars: It's your regular loud bunch of people. I have no problem with the atmosphere by any means so no real complaints here. SERVICE = 1 Star: On on occasion, my water had a fly in it and then when the waitress gave me a ""new"" glass of water, it had lip marks on it. That was a fail. I understand not seeing the bug or whatever, but the lip marks? Gross. The second time, the problems started when we first arrived. There was no one managing the people coming in so there were 8 of us just standing around for a few minutes while we waited for someone to remember that there were unattended customers at the front. Even when doing so, there was no apology for the long wait or anything of that nature. I decided to let it slide, but it was just downhill from there. When they finally sat us down, they had the bartender take care of us. He took our order and mysteriously disappeared. He didn't reappear until it was time to pay. I understand that he works the bar, but if that's the case, give us an actual waiter/waitress. So, some other guy was taking care of us and in our order, we ordered Sweet Potato Fries. When it arrived, it was greasy as all hell. I know fried foods are a given to be greasy, but this was unacceptable. It had a sheen and glimmer of oil that was really disgusting. So, we had to call him back (he dropped it off and disappeared) because he didn't bother to look at what he gave us and we decided to cancel our side order. I am not one to cancel an order, but this was gross. We even took pictures of the food and took the names down of  waiters in case I decided to contact their corporate folks. That's how annoyed I was with everything. Not to mention that no one checked on us once we got our food. RECOMMENDATION: Eat here if you want to experience it, but I think people would be better off if they stayed away or even went to another location (like West Covina) instead of this one. If you decide to skip over this place, don't worry... you're not missing much. Since the last incident, I've opted to not come back here for a while (or a long while) because the experience was so bad. I think other places have better burgers and more importantly way better service for that matter.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arcadia?start=300,2.76,2.76,2.76,2.536,2.76

Let alone we were on our way to go see Brave. So being the nice dad that I am, I took us over to red robin to grub.  Definitely a fun Daddy & Daughter day =) Well we arrived about 11:30am on a Saturday and lo and behold the joint was almost empty!!! We got immediately sat which is awesome when dealing with a munchkin to say the least! Pro Tip: Make sure to get the crayon pack for your kids. It is very good to share the coloring chores together Well I got a bacon cheeseburger and it was decent. It wasnt hideous nor was I going to confuse it with a top burger... but it was definitely able to hit the burger spot. The munchkin ate half of hers fairly quickly before filling up. So that is a good sign.  Pro Tip #2: The steak fries are bottomless, this is definitely a record that I didnt even eat all of the fries in my original basket. I used to get 3-5 baskets of them. Ohhhh how the metabolism changes you =\ I still definitely enjoy the french fries seasoning. Its great that they have a shaker of it on every table. Awesome! The service was decent and they even hooked up the munchkin with a balloon and that was a huge hit. She started smiling right then for ages when that happened. So average grub, good service (the manager even asked us how things were twice), and some good kid dinner favors made this an over all enjoyable service.

Well... to be honest it fell exactly where I thought it would it be: pretty decent. 3.5 FOOD QUALITY: If Red Robins is known for their burgers, then burgers I will have! I'm reminded of what their food was like years ago and I have to say it's consistent to what I remember.  The patty itself was moderately juicy; while the meat doesn't melt in your mouth it was still pretty good for what it's worth.  Straw onions itself were definitely not fresh and was not fried perfectly (or even fried enough since there was no crunch.)  For the Chophouse burger, I felt that the flavors were good and strong but a little bit too salty -- definitely a slight imbalance of flavors. I liked the burger overall. I wasn't very fond of the wedge cut fries since they were very inconsistent in texture.  SERVICE: Service was pretty nice, polite, and respectable. Food came out pretty quick since they weren't too busy.  ENVIRONMENT: It's new, it's clean, and it's pretty spacious. Lots of seating with, interestingly enough, a special bar area which I did not check out at all.  Overall, this place is pretty good but I don't think it's anything special.

It is on the pricer side.  I don't know how many fries people are consuming that it could possibly make up for the difference in price. They have a good assortment of burgers and sandwiches.  I got a Bruschetta Chicken Sandwich.  It was okay, but it didn't really have a bruschetta feel.  It had diced tomatoes, but it didn't have a toasted bun or the right sauce.  I could barely taste the pesto aioli, and the other brown sauce tasted funny.  (I'm guessing it was supposed to be balsalmic cream). My friend got the Fish Sandwich.  Hers was under-sauced, dry, and unflavorful.  She asked for extra tartar, which they gave. She also got the freckled lemonade, but they kept putting her strawberries on the bottom of a load of ice.  With the strange glass shape, it was a trying feat to fish out those berries!

I love the classic diner feel and they always have great food, even when they change up their menu. So I was pretty thrilled when they opened up a location at the Santa Anita Mall so I didn't have to always go to Glendale Galleria to get my Red Robin fix. It was pretty quiet for a Tuesday night, which was super nice. My friend and I really only shared the restaurant with four other small groups. The hostess quickly sat us at a booth and another staff member brought us water immediately. Quick service is always a plus. The stack of onion rings we got were deliciously warm and crisped to perfection. I love love love onion rings and Red Robin can do no wrong. I usually get a wrap or sandwich but I decided to try and be ""good"" so I got the Whiskey BBQ Chicken Salad. It was pretty good, lots of yummy flavors. Only complaint was that the salad was drowned, and I mean DROWNED, in the dressing. Like I said, it was still delicious, but possibly a little too much. I also had a skinny margarita. I'm generally skeptical of ""skinny"" drinks because it generally means they will either be watered down, or just juice. This one pleasantly was neither. It tasted like a real margarita.

So first the hostess that greeted us was really nice and she was very pleasant with every guest but it all went downhill once we got seated.  It took about 10 mins before our server ever came around to even acknowledge we were there. Once she came to the table we immediately told her what drinks we wanted and what food we wanted. Me and my friend each ordered a burger which comes with bottomless fries. We requested to get the fries first. The best servers at Red Robin usually offer this to their clients since you get as many fries as you want might as well eat some while your waiting for your burger.  About 20 minutes later, no food and no drinks. Instead our server comes to tell us that she lost our order and that she will have to retake it. Really?! Where did our order just go? And it took you 20 minutes to figure out that our order just disappeared. Her excuse was that we aren't really her table and that she was just helping another server that will be right with us. Girl you did not help him at all.  So our server finally comes with our drinks and our bottomless fries first. No joke he only gave us one basket with 10 pieces of fries. Yes we counted them! In about 3 minutes we finished our 10 pieces of fries and our lemonades. Our server never bothered coming back to our table until our food was ready.

You can't get 16 burgers at the same time, not to mention there were other people in the restaurant as well! FOOD: I ordered the Guacamole Bacon Burger. It was good, but there wasn't much guac and what was on there was more of a dark green, maybe they needed to make a new batch of guac? SERVICE: Hostess was a sweeheart! Our servers were so attentive and fulfilled all of our needs in no time whether it was a request for ranch/barbeque, more refills on our drinks, or those fresh hot bottomless fries!

Because I have no self control -_- Jin C. and I came here for lunch last Sunday. And I ordered the following: BOTTOMLESS FRECKLED LEMONADE: The drink that made us delicious. And famous. -- This is their famous strawberry lemonade, but unfortunately it was not as ""freckled"" as I had remembered it being. They were being skimpy on the strawberries :( But it was still good, and I made sure to take advantage of it being ""bottomless"" by getting two refills. WHISKEY RIVER BBQ BURGER: Our smoky, tangy tribute to the Wild West. We roped together our signature bourbon-infused Whiskey River BBQ Sauce, crispy onion straws, Cheddar, tomatoes and mayo. Comes with Bottomless Fries. -- Tastes just as good as it sounds. I meant to only eat half of it so that I could focus on my fries, but our server was late with the fries so I ended up eating the whole thing :( I enjoyed it though! BOTTOMLESS FRIES: Came with our requested sauces of Ranch and Honey Poppyseed (basically honey mustard). (Ketchup is already at the table.) -- These were my downfall. They are steak fries, fresh and piping hot! Jin C. had also ordered a burger (I don't even remember what it was any more) so she also had bottomless fries. So when we requested refills, they brought out a large basket for us to share. Our eyes were bigger than our stomachs and we got three refills. Yeah... that was a mistake. Don't do that if you're just in a group of two. We regretted it in the end because we were so uncomfortabley full -_- The food here is pretty good and the service is okay. Our server didn't come by very often though, so it felt like every single time we saw him we were requesting a refill of something (either fries or drink). But he was really nice so it was fine.

309,Vanessa F.,"Upland, CA",152,40,27.0,1.0,2013-11-19,"Two of my co-workers and I went in during our lunch break on a Sunday - it was not busy but not empty either. We walked to the bar section because service is usually a bit quicker there and sat down, a server quickly asked what we wanted to drink . . . then we waited . . . and waited . . . during the 15 minutes of us sitting there, the bartender was making drinks at the bar, ringing people up, and obviously, not getting our drinks.  Ready to complain, my friend/co-worker flagged down a woman who looked like a manager - she happened to be holding our drinks (this was now about 20 minutes after we placed a drink order). We told her we were on a lunch break and haven't even placed our order yet, she wrote down everything then talked about the Royalty card, etc. About 15 minutes pass and our food arrives (which normally isn't bad but is when you have already waited for 20 minutes).   - Spinach and artichoke dip was COLD.  - My friend asked for no jalapeños on her chili fries only to find them in there and proceeded to try and pick out each diced jalapeño.  - My other friend said her clam chowder was not good at all but she was hungry and we were out of time so she ate it.  At that point, friend #1 asked for the manager and explained what was wrong. About the jalapeños, the manager had the nerve to say ""well, you ordered like you knew what you were getting so I thought you didn't want the jalapeños on top but knew they were diced in the chili."" ...Seriously ??? Trying to put the blame on the customer ? What a joke. Just apologize, ask if there is anything you can do, and take it off the bill without having to be asked. Needless to say, my friend said she would need a credit back to her account because she wasn't going to pay for it (we had paid while eating). The manager disappeared and never came back !! Ten minutes later, we then had to ask the original server to get a manager - a shorter, blonde woman came over to us. She was a perfect example of what the other manager should have done from the beginning - very apologetic and didn't blame anything on us, also explained that the other manager got her shirt dirty and was embarrassed. I think her name was Leslie - I truly don't recall though.   Overall, I have had decent experiences in the past - never great, but always nice - and this one was just horrible. It went wrong on all types of levels. Maybe it was a bad day or we just had bad luck . . . not sure which but we regretted our choice of going there for lunch.

Everyone knows about the bottomless steakfries that comes with an order of a burger. But what about the bottomless floats? Bottomless lemonades? And my new favorite: bottomless broccoli! You can substitute your bottomless fries for steamed broccoli instead, and that's what I did. Sounds a little crazy, but if you're there with someone who is going to get bottomless fries already, why not switch it up? You can also substitute the steakfries with other options too, but some are with an additional fee.  2) Burgers are yummy. I got the Whiskey River BQQ burger cooked to medium, and it was really flavorful. They were generous with the crispy onion straw too. The buns were toasted in a lot of grease, sadly to say. Good thing I had steamed broccoli to balance it out a bit! 3)The environment is nice. I like the location of it (in the Promenade); it makes for a more intimate experience just being away from all the window shoppers within the mall.

The riblets were actually good, but the portion size is somewhat on the small side (for the price of the dish, at least). The Texas toast was decent. The mac & cheese was adequate, although I've definitely had better elsewhere. The ""coleslaw"" was actually rather vile ... I would rank it below any other coleslaw I have tried. It was dry, coarsely chopped, and made me feel like a bunny eating raw cabbage. To be frank, I would even rather have the soggy coleslaw served by KFC. Seriously Red Robin, if you don't know how to properly make coleslaw, simply take it off your menu. Or just commit Seppuku, whatever. I also tried the Clucks & Shrimp plate. The chicken tenders and shrimp were both decent, but again ... portion sizes that were rather small for the price of the plate. See a pattern here yet? The bottomless steak fries were pretty good. The bottomless ""Very Berry Raspberry Limeade"" was actually surprisingly good and refreshing. In general, the food here seems to be priced on the high side for the quality/quantity of what is served. The service was attentive but *INSANELY* overbearing, and tasting somewhat of insincerity. On one hand, I never had to get anyone's attention to get my bottomless beverage refilled, and I don't remember ever lacking for anything at the table. As a result, I can't say that this service here unqualifiably sucked. On the other hand, It seemed like a different waitress was asking me ""everything OK?"" every 2 minutes ... and worse, not even *seeming* like they really gave a shit whether I said ""yes"" or ""no"", but more like they were just going through the motions (I probably should have seen that coming the moment I realized the staff seemed to be comprised exclusively of Valley Girls. By the way, I *love* Valley Girls ... I just haven't had the best experiences with them as my waitresses. YMMV.). Seeing the check brought to my table before I asked for it was the final faux pas that made me realize this would probably be my final visit here. Seriously, I can't stand restaurants with this type of ""service"". The restaurant is rather noisy due to the sports bar and TVs. Given that the place is located at the mall, the parking situation is not the best.

We sat right next to the kitchen. I think they should get rid of those tables because no one should be forced to watch their food under a heat lamp for 20 minutes.  Why bother with bottomless anything because we barely got refills on our drinks and fries. Food came out warm and all the fries were cold. Getting hot fries was impossible, never once were they fresh and hot. We watched tons of waiters and the manager just stand around chatting and laughing while 6 trays of food sat under the heat lamps. We saw out waiter about 3 times total, all night.

Heavier set waitress with dark hair & other server girls saw me but, i got no acknowledgement or greeting. (WT?!?) Two were busy with orders. Two saw me and turned their backs towards me to talk to their customers. The heavier set woman leaned across the booth by the front, back towards me, as if she was trying to avoid contact with me.  Finally, ""Corey"" came to greet me and take me to my booth. He was very polite, curtious, helpful & made some great selections from the menu to choose from. If not for him, i probably would have made a scene. I wanted to start filming everything going on i mentioned here with my cellphone camera/video recorder! (Who knows how many views this would have gotten!?) Others experiencing something like this, may have walked out after this ridiculous waiting! Anyways, my food came out in about another 8 minutes or so. Got the Bleu Cheese Burger & Fries with a Coke. Fries seemed kind less on the portion. Not sure if that was standard for Red Robin. Both were Very Delish though pricey. Meal came out to $18.84. Expensive! Corey asked if i wanted more fries, i declined. Though Corey was very nice, it seemed like a scam giving me less fries so, i can order more. Not trying to say nothing bad towards him, i have experience in ""The Service Industry"". More % in tips with the more food that i order! After i finished my meal, Corey kindly asked if i would like anything & i asked for the check. He was Very busy with other orders in the kitchen. I left $25 cash in the black restaurant check book and left. I thought the heavy-set waitress said goodbye but, i doubt it. She was talking to another skinny tall guy, both sitting on their knees on the front waiting area bench seats leaning on the glass partition. No eye contact, no acknowledgement. Horrible, horrible customer service!  Though the food is great, i don't mind paying a bit higher for my meal but, if not for the gentleman server Corey, i would not return here! I Was Highly Dissatisfied Tonight! Thanks Corey, you made my awful experience very pleasant! Thanks again! This place needs better servers working here.

Waiting 30 minutes to be seated with only two names ahead of me, to waiting nearly 30 minutes for our food to be served from the time we ordered. Over and over our table's conversation went to, ""where is our food, they are just cooking burgers!"". Thinking this was a kid friendly place they would know of the short attention span of a child and having them wait so long means by the time food arrives they was to get out and run around. I saw other families struggle with their young kids as they became restless like mine.

We came in as a party of 4 for a birthday and it seemed like the majority of customers had the same idea, as we heard celebratory songs the whole night. Despite that, the restaurant seemed pretty slow and not crowded at all at 7:30pm. There was a server change, which made things all the more confusing and there was no smooth transition or effective communication between the servers, as our server did not deliver the bottomless fries before our burgers and we were starving while the burgers took forever to come out.  The food itself was good, but it was difficult to really get any substantial service. We had to ask the server a couple of times for fairly simple things-- box, check, etc. When the bill came, the birthday burger was not marked off and I had to flag down the server again to make sure it was taken off and the Loyalty number had to be taken again (remember the former server had left early on).  All in all, it was quite a frustrating experience. I am not sure if it was our particular waitress that wasn't efficient, the kitchen staff, management of the place overall, or a combination of all of the above but I could tell straight off the bat that the servers had to traverse longer distances because of unclean tables and spreading the diners out when there are apparently not enough staff. I really have no idea what was going on that night. It was just unpleasant.  Our server did however bring all the things we requested despite asking her several times, so that was good. She also got some plates for us to cut our birthday cake; unfortunately we didn't have a birthday song, but I suppose our guest of honor didn't want to partake in such a tradition, so it was good for her.  This meal took 1.5 hours overall -- that's how slow it was. It was actually reaching up to 2 hours after the bill was paid. Any plans of shopping around after dinner were thrown out the window after this. Oh well.  Lesson learned-- go to other Red Robin locations, just not this one.

So, they were craving In 'N Out and I suggested Red Robins instead. Little did they know, the burgers here are bomb AF, plus bottomless fries! WHUT?! We all ordered the most affordable burger on the menu, of course the Red Taverns Double! for $6.99, you get a gourmet burger with bottomless seasoned fries! I think that's better than an In 'N Out double double animal style cheeseburger!  Anyways, I ordered an Arnold Palmer (ice tea lemonade) here for the first time, I assumed it would be sort of sweet.. since other places I ordered from were slightly sweet instead of bland. Meh, I guess they added more ice tea than the lemonade. Whatev's, NBD! (: Continuing.. we got our food, and we smashed our face with the burgers! We were SOO hungry, we all devoured everything within 10 minutes! What?! We then asked for another round of fries and devoured that within minutes too! They LOVED the fries and the taste of the delicious burger! Not to mention... today, my sister and her boyfriend asked me to take them back to Red Robins so they can eat what we ate last time! haha I knew they would fall in love with this place!

I came here with 6 coworkers to celebrate a couple birthdays.  At 11:45AM, the restaurant was not busy at all and we were seated within a few minutes.  We ordered onion rings to share and they dropped some on the floor. They told us they would make more to make up for it. (I actually don't remember if they did or not.) We ordered burgers and salads for the most part and everyone had mixed reviews. My friend who sat next to me said she didn't like her salad. The crispy chicken in it was very dry and the birthday girl also did not enjoy her mushroom burger. She said it was different from the last time she ordered it. My other coworker ordered her usual turkey burger on wheat but with steak fries. I was aiming for a salad as well, but ultimately got the Original Red Robin Cheeseburger with steak fries and a peach iced tea. I thought the burger tasted fine and it came with endless fries, but one portion was enough for me.  The manager visited our table and asked us how everything was. Our coworker also got a small sundae and some of the staff sang to her. Overall, it was just an average experience with average food. Our server was just okay. She spoke with very monotone voice and barely smiled, but she did her job. 126/100 Reviews for 2015",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arcadia?start=40,2.64,2.78,2.78,2.408,2.724
274,william g.,"Arcadia, CA",10,21,1.0,1.0,2015-08-11,"Went here during the weekday because Soup Plantation some 5 minutes away was packed (couldn't find parking).  As soon as we are seated here at Red Robin, my date asks if the Raspberry ice tea is sweetened. When the waitress says that the regular ice tea is the only one not sweetened, I decide to take it. Though my date says she will decide on a drink once it is time to order the meal, the waitress still brings both of us an iced tea.  Now the waiting part of this visit.....for it being very slow and very empty, our waitress is walking right by us several times, even though we are clearly ready to order. She then heads off to a table near the entrance and along with the manager, is dealing with what looks like a customer disputing their order (this wasn't even her section). I then see her go to the kitchen, trash-talking that customer to another co-worker (you don't ever want to be served by someone like this.....how do you know she won't trash you behind your back the same way?). She then walks right by us to help a couple sitting in an outdoor table (since the outdoor area was directly behind me, not sure if that couple was here before me). By this time, I am now telling my date to prepare to leave should we still have to wait another minute or two (the guy busing the tables behind me heard me but did nothing to help). When I see our waitress pass us again only to walk behind the counter near the kitchen and share a few laughs with another waiter, I tell my date that we are leaving. From the time this waitress brought us our drinks to the time I walked out, she must have walked right by our table some 4-5 times in a span of 10-15 minutes (trust me....other than the couple sitting outside and a group of 4 who already paid their check and left, there was no one else in her section).  A lesson to be learned.....I don't care how great the food looks on an online photo or how attractive the place is or what kind of fantastic discounts you see online, American-chained restaurants (most but not all) are not about customer service or quality but about bad service, rising prices, and shrinking portions. Most employees like this waitress are nothing more than part-time workers who wouldn't care less about bad feedback or service simply because this is not going to be their career. Mom and Pop owned restaurants/eateries are the way to go because to them, it is always about ""the customer"". Another lesson to be learned....for someone who always reads Yelp Reviews, I still don't understand why I did not read the reviews of this place (mostly 1-2 star reviews) before showing up.  ALWAYS READ YELP REVIEWS BEFORE CONSIDERING A VISIT TO A RESTAURANT YOU ARE TRYING FOR THE FIRST TIME OR FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arcadia?start=260,2.6,2.78,2.78,2.2760000000000002,2.708
249,Lizzy V.,"Pasadena, CA",4,13,10.0,1.0,2015-08-18,"Highly disappointed on my trip to this establishment. I was raving about this place to my husband , as I had been there years ago, after we went to see a movie and he felt like a burger. He wanted to go to Wendy's but after a bad incident the last time o thought this place would be better only to regret it. First off our waitress was nice, but kept having our orders wrong. And non it wasn't that busy but then again it could be her first time, this wasn't really the issue though. The problem was our burgers weren't really good, Wendy's would've been better and for half the price. I ordered mine with ""no pink"" (well done) as so did my husband, but mine still had a lot of pink, I'm guessing it was medium rare. Thought of saying something but I didn't want spit on my food, so i sucked it in and hoped it was at least as good as it looked. But no. The onions were battered, with mostly grease of you ask me. The fries were okay, but you get a very small.portion , I'm guessing so they don't waste a lot since they are 'bottomless' . The campfire ranch dressing was ok. Atmosphere was so so. All in all its not the place I remember it to be, and the quality of the food and taste have changed for the worst.

We ate there this past Thursday for my birthday and hoping the service would be different from our previous visit but sad to report it wasn't. We only get drink refills once and checked on once. In my opinion, if your dining in for over an hour, you should be ""checked on"" at least 4 times, minimum, we have a baby with us, we always need more napkins and water refills.  Service is important in the food industry and the more my husband and I dine out the more we see how much the industry has changed (since we worked in it). Zero sense of urgency, mediocre attitudes, less and less smiling. In my opinion if food servers continue down this route, families are going to continue to turn to more convenient means of food service.

While the food is on par with your normal chain restaurant food in terms of consistency and variety to cater to a wide demographic and hasn't changed in the times I've returned (and food wasn't the problem), it's the service that varies. I encountered the most outstanding server on my most recent visit on Labor Day 2015. It wasn't too busy on a 7 pm dinner, but I can tell they probably just had their dinner rush as a lot of empty tables were not bussed yet. We were seated in the wayyyy back, at the last booth before the doors to the outside deck. I was sure we may be overlooked at our spot, but our server Leo made sure we were attended to. After he took our order, he came back multiple times to see if we needed drinks refilled, another batch of bottomless fries, or anything else. I was really impressed. His attention was almost a complete 360 from the service we received at all prior visits to Red Robin!! I sure hope to be seated in his section the next time I return to Red Robin. His service and demeanor (friendly, did not show any signs that it might have been a long day or shift, especially working on a holiday) really stood out and made the meal a pleasant experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arcadia?start=60,2.48,2.78,2.78,2.668,2.66

He even brought our bottomless fries to munch on before we got our burgers.  California chicken burger was good. Thick piece of chicken breast with guac, lettuce, and tomatoes. Chicken wasn't too dry.  A1 Peppercorn burger was very very peppercorn-y. So if you don't like the strong taste of peppercorn, stay away! Beef patty was cooked perfectly pink to our request.  Both burgers were served with more fries. The steak fries were ok. A little on the soggier side but I like my fries like that. Not too much flavor but you can add the Red Robin signature blend seasoning to them if you like (bottle is at each table). They were much better with the seasoning! We also tried the garlic herbed fries (extra 99 cents) which weren't anything special. They just sprinkled with chopped cilantro and Parmesan cheese on their usual steak fries.  The Royal Red Robin is probably the best burger on the menu. It's basically a cheeseburger with a fried egg. It's definitely my favorite burger they offer.  With the huge burgers and bottomless fries, your palate won't get overly excited but you'll definitely leave full.

Did not love this one. Big crowd out front and we were told there was a 20 minute wait. Then I was told the bar was open and could sit right away, after the hostess turned away from me to point to the area and talk and I had to ask her twice to please face me when she talks, her voice was simply soft.  We go to the bar and on the way I saw nothing but empty tables. Crowds waiting out front, but plenty of empty tables. Made zero sense and swamped the bar tender (super nice guy). We order and wait, play a trivia game and wait. The food arrives and its luke warm at best. As far as bottomless fries, I got six. Six fries. Six individual fries. I ordered the black and blue burger - ordered it medium rare. It was over cooked. After a few bites I also noticed it was spicy. I've ordered the exact same burger at two other locations and it was wonderful. I was really hungry and thought I was just being a wimp about spice but it was pretty bad. My girlfriend ordered a ghost pepper burger and hers was not spicy, so we figured out they got something wrong. I wait and wait and wait to talk to someone, even hit the 'call server' button on the little kiosk and two servers (not the bar tender) walked right past us. Then I see the group behind me had the little light flashing as well and it was going unnoticed. Finally I ask for a menu again to look for any spice on the burger just to make sure it wasn't my mistake. It wasn't. I sat so long I gave up and paid. By the time anyone really came to listen to me (the poor swamped bartender) I had given up. And I have given up again. I will stick to the Northridge or Glendale location.

This place wouldn't be ideal on a weekend as it's located in the Santa Anita Mall, so parking can be difficult. On the other hand, we came on a Thursday night and it was practically empty. Upon arrival, it took them awhile for a host to come seat us. Once seated, our server was very accommodating. We had two sets of the deal, which the server indicated will result in a two separate checks, but no problem. For the appetizers, the four of us shared the O'Rings Shorty ($5) and Salsa, Guac, and Chips ($5). Both appetizers were very greasy, but it's typical American food. I liked the crunch of the onion rings and the salted chips with both their respective complimentary sauces. As for the burgers, I had the Fiery Ghost, brother had the Nacho Crunch, mother had the Pig Out, and father had the Tavern. Two of us paired it with fries while the other two paired with steamed broccoli --either way, both are endless, which is awesome. When we got our burgers, I thought I remembered them being a lot bigger. At most, the burgers were average and seemed to lack much ingredients. Make sure you season your fries and broccoli as the seasoning is bomb. When it was time for pay, you can pay by card on your own with their little tablet on each table. I noticed that our deals came out to $17 instead of $15, so I had to call our server over to fix the problem. My brother and mine burger were switched as well and we didn't even realize it until I was a few bites in. Their service is a bit of a mess, but when mentioned, they were gladly able to fix it. Either way, I think I'd rather spend a little more for an amazing burger than one that I could make myself.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arcadia?start=20,2.92,2.84,2.84,2.3120000000000003,2.872

We came to this restaurant at about 7:30PM on Friday, September 30.  We sat in the bar area. Although we were assisted promptly, we only saw the server once after the food was delivered.  The burgers seem to be getting smaller and the fry portions seem to be getting smaller too.  Yes, it is unlimited fries and I usually get two portions.  However, if they would just give one slightly larger portion, I wouldn't even want a refill.   Tonight, we were in the bar area, which is higher than the rest of this restaurant.  We had a good view of the kitchen.   In the kitchen during our visit was possibly ""the manager"" or maybe it was the ""kitchen manager"".  I don't know.  We were just sitting there counting the ridiculous number of health code violations.  I don't work in that industry; however, they are violations that we read in the newspaper all the time.  First of all, she wasn't dressed to work at Red Robin.  She was dressed as if she was ready to go out on a Friday night.  Kind of unprofessional. Then, she kept swinging her hair back and forth and running her hands through her hair and then seemed to be touching the food.  And she was drinking out of a glass in a open container.  Aren't all of those health violations?   Anyway, on the way out at 8:40PM, I counted 27 empty tables all trashed.  In fact, I didn't notice one bus person in the entire restaurant (not just on the way out; however, the entire time I was in the restaurant).  And guess what?  There was still a wait at 8:40PM and no one could be seated because none of the tables were bussed.  Even in the bar area, our server was bussing tables.  Why would I want to go to a restaurant with a wait, if there were plenty of tables; however, not enough help? I really have noticed the decline in Red Robin over the past 1 to 2 years, and I feel that something changed higher up.  Something not so good.  I have been to probably 7 or 8 locations in the past several years.  A terrible one in Northern California, a pretty bad one in the Vegas area, some bad ones in the LA area; however, the one in Lancaster, PA seemed to be pretty nice.  Anyway, it is a good concept -- I just wish they would fix it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arcadia?start=20,3.08,2.8,2.748,2.056,2.9120000000000004

Not once did the server come to check on us. They never even brought out my drink. I had to request for it after they brought our food (40min later).  Complaint 3) My order wasn't right. I requested a turkey sandwich and got a turkey burger. I also requested for cheese and did I get that? Nope. I wasn't going to bother changing my order again.

95,Linda B.,"Monterey Park, CA",618,317,848.0,1.0,2017-03-30,"Food: YES.  Service: NO.  Been coming to this particular RR for YEARRRS! I used to work at a restaurant within the mall and would come by often with coworkers for food and for drinks. Though I no longer work at the mall, I still meet up with friends here because we really enjoy the food.  I've always sat at the bar since the day it opened but these last few times have basically been crap and don't see the point in sitting there anymore because I feel like I'm being neglected and treated differently. I don't want to pull the racist card here but I don't have any other explanation as to why I am treated so poorly by this server.  We came in and considered getting a table but there was nobody at the front and there were a couple of parties in front of us waiting for a host or someone to come by to seat them. I suggested that we go to the bar so we wouldn't have to wait too long since we had an idea of what we were going to order.  There was one other couple sitting up at the bar that were finishing up and leaving soon. Paula came by to ask us what we wanted to drink and we asked for water first and she responded, ""I still need to see your ID if you want to sit up here"". We showed her our IDs as she returned with our waters. My friend ordered a Stella and I hadn't made up my mind yet and she left. It took her a while to come back directly to us but she came back to make bar drinks. I can understand that the bar is somewhat of an inconvenience because it's elevated from the rest of the restaurant and it can be hard to see but she didn't make an effort to see if we're gonna order food or just drinks. A group of three girls came and sat next to us at the bar and she was quick to greet them right away and as she was asking for their beverages, she asked if they wanted to see menus for food. She gave it to them and continued to neglect us; we had to flag her down for the menus. More parties were starting to show up at the bar and she was attending to them. Someone who I assumed was the manager came by to talk to the three girl and asked if they were ready to order. He took their orders and did not say anything to us. I know Paula was busy walking back and forth between the kitchen, new tables and the bar but she never looked our way. We did not end up ordering until 30 minutes after we sat and we ordered last. How do I know? Everybody that came after us had gotten their food before us. I ended up ordering a Stella and she didn't bring it until about 20 minutes later. She forgot and when she realized it she dropped it off without a word. An apology would've been nice, I don't know why she delayed my drink. I saw her put it in the computer and she's the one pouring all the drinks! Paula's attitude changed once our food arrived. Another server brought it out and the only thing we asked from Paula was extra napkins. The bar was clearing out as it was getting close to their closing time and she explained how to close out our checks on the little device and said goodbye to us when we left.  ------ The last time I came with another girlfriend, Paula was also at the bar and it was pretty much the same thing. Said we need to show our IDs if we wanted to sit up at the bar. She looked busy and I know she was busy because she kept complaining about it to her coworkers. Didn't get menus til we asked for it, took forever to order. Ignored, neglected, and not cared for.  I gave her the benefit of the doubt and thought she was just having a bad day but I've been lucky enough to have her as my server at the bar for so many times that I actually believe she hates me. It upsets me because before I even get to say a word to her she decides to be rude to me or treat me like a child. I'm nearly 30 and can read; I know that 21+ can only sit at the bar, I'm not needy and I rarely make modifications when I order. What did I do to her to make her hate me? I've been a server for nearly 10 years and know the good and the many ugly sides of the restaurant industry and know what it's like to be treated below others. If I was a regular guest and treated her like crap, I could understand her reciprocating the mutual feelings. Ugh, but every damn time I come? I always come with different friends and she treats my friends and I like crap each time!!!  I wish I was able to tell the manager on duty but I never see them when I'm there! And this last time I did see a manager, he ignored us for prettier girls! Thanks RR.  This is the last time I'll be dining at the RR in Santa Anita.

We were ignored by the staff and the guy I presumed to be the manager by the way he was dressed. The wait staff/management were too busy engrossed in their own LOL conversations to notice us. When the waitress finally came to our table, she let out a loud burp and laughed it off saying that she had just drunk a soda too fast. Not an ""excuse me"" or any other apology, and when she saw we didn't think it was very funny, her attitude got even worse. It took forever to get our food and when we did it was pathetic. The food was cold and there were only 5 french fries in the cup on our plate.

We asked for a table that was half booth and half chairs. When the front host took us to our table it was all chairs. We saw 4 areas that were half booth and tables that had a server assigned to but it was like pulling teeth to get what we asked for. After waiting 20min with other parties being settled and the same party size we got what we asked for. Again the place was not that busy. Our waiter was cool at first. Really talkative easy to get along with. We ordered our drinks and asked for a few minutes to look at the menu. Ten minutes later we got our drinks and we were ready to order by then but having our drinks earlier would have been cool. Again not that busy. We ordered our food it came out and all but I already went through my drink. With empty glass on table I asked for a refill of my drink which had been empty for ten minutes by now. Sure thing..... 10 minutes later we were asked how everything was. We said the food was great but where is my refill to wash it all down. Oh yeah forgot about that. So I asked while he was getting mine to refill my wife bottomless root beer float. He came back with my drink then left. Time went by he came back to clear the table and my wife ask where her refill was and he replied he forgot to put the order in. My wife asked if she could get one to go and the waiters reply was 'then it wouldn't be bottomless now would it?' And left. Again it was not busy and we were a group of four.  I don't think I will return to this Red Robin. This was the second RR that we went to in a month (the other in Escondido) that we received crumby service.

So, here we are - visiting Red Robin (even though we have one 5 minutes away from home that we ALWAYS go to - even though there's so many new restaurants to try here). We walked in and it was pretty empty - it was around 11:30-almost noon. A few minutes go by and a girl comes by and takes us to our seats - we weren't sure who our server was and it was probably 5 or so minutes til this guy came, introduced himself and asked us for our drink orders. We both got water - and he said he'd come back in a bit. A few more minutes go by and he comes to drop off our waters and leaves before we even had a chance to tell him we were ready to order. Im going to go ahead and say it took about 15 minutes from the moment we sat down til when we finally ordered our food. On a busy day, I understand - there's a lot of people BUT on a week day when its not even crowded - was a little weird. We ordered and within a few minutes our appetizer came out. We got the boneless bbq wings and it was delicious. It wasn't hot though or warm - more like it was done a while already and then he brought it out. A few minutes later, our burgers came out and I KID YOU NOT I ONLY HAD 6 PIECES OF FRIES ON MY PLATE. My brother and I looked at each other and bursted out laughing. By this point, I was over it - I ate my food, asked for a refill of fries - which took so long to come out that I didn't even want it anymore. Of course I ate it though because I didn't want to waste it but man.. I don't know what was up with this place or the worker. Everyone working didn't look happy to be there.

We were greeted and escorted to a seating area that comprised of a round table with dining chairs which had  standard to normal padding. We respectfully requested to be seated at a booth which had more padding and back support due to my mother's back for which she has a handicap disability. The waitress told us to wait by the round table as she had to clear it by her manager who was standing 10 feet away from us. As we waited, we observed most of the booths were readily available and that they could hold four adults and a child. The waitress came back and told us that she's sorry and that they could ONLY sit us at the round table at the time. I asked her why we couldn't sit sit the booth and she didn't have an answer other than ""sorry we can only sit you here right now. I will say about 80 percent of the restaurant was empty. I am really disappointed in the restaurant and the customer service as I have worked in the business and do EVERYTHING I can to keep customers happy and returning.

It makes me wonder how many people have had this happened to them in the past and why it seems to CONTINUE.   #notadacompliant  #americanswithdisablities #betterbusinessbureau #poorserviceredrobin#shameonyou   #disabledanddiscriminated",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arcadia?start=20,2.36,2.62,2.68,2.5960000000000005,2.516

I wasn't a big fan of the coleslaw they had on the plate either .  I let the server know about the issue with the shrimp so she was helpful to get some more that were freshly fried and the manager brought them out so that was cool on their part .

90,Grace E.,"San Gabriel, CA",663,326,393.0,2.0,2017-08-23,Sadly I feel like Red Robin has gone down in quality and service. Everything is mostly automated now and it is not as crowded as it was before. I came here for dinner after the mall for a quick dinner bite. For some reason I ordered the Cod and Shrimp Plate which came with 2 pieces of fried fish chips and a couple pieces of shrimp. It was definitely not worth the price which was around $15. I did not feel too good afterwards and I felt like the shrimp might have been weird. There is a little machine at your table where you can order appetizers and pay with your credit card.

The host sat us away from their very tiny TV so we asked if we could sit at a nearby empty booth. His first response was they don't have enough servers in that section. We insisted we would like to be closer to the TV and he said something like that booth is not ready.  We didn't want to argue so we just sat where he originally appointed. When I took my daughter to the restroom I realized why he didn't sit us at that emptied booth...the table had not been cleaned.  There were multiple emptied tables that were filled with dirty dishes and napkins. It was a mess. I don't know how long they were left dirty but nobody cleaned it the entire time we were at the restaurant. It was not a good experience. The food was decent but we could not enjoy it because we couldn't even see the score of the game!

Been here twice and both times have been great. There was a tv that was off and because we got seated in the back area, we kindly asked them if they could turn on the Lakers game.

As for the burger, I told them how I wanted my burger and it was made perfectly. Bottomless fries doesn't hurt as well.
