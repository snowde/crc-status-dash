107,Clay M.,"Westminster, CO",1,5,,3.0,2012-03-05,"This is a place I've tried sporadically over the years, and always found good but not outstanding. Yesterday I found myself in the area and, since I was in the mood for a burger (which I usually am), decided to try it again. I had the peppercorn burger and found it... okay. The best thing about it was the little onion strings liberally scattered atop the patty (I love those things!), but other than that it was a pretty routine sandwich. I think the standard for a good burger is rising these days, what with places like Smashburger, Five Guys, and Larkburger appearing all over the Denver landscape, so maybe Red Robin needs to step things up a bit with a little fresher ingredients and higher quality beef (not that there's anything inferior about either now, they just didn't really rise above the competition). I'd say the steak fries are also fairly standard, but the fact that they're an all-you-can-eat proposition makes them an excellent value (but I swear I only had one modest refill besides my original order!). My Blue Moon Ale was tasty, especially after a morning outside in windy weather, which really made me thirsty. The waitstaff was also very polite and reasonably prompt, and seemed to be holding up well under the onslaught of families with little kids that stormed the place while I was there (eat here before noon on a weekend if you like quiet dining!). Overall it was a pleasant experience. Next time I'm in the neighborhood and hungry, I'm sure I'll go back again. There are some interesting chicken and fish items on the menu, so if I can overcome my seemingly unlimited addiction to cheeseburgers, maybe I'll find something to get a little more excited about for my re-review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arvada?start=100,2.572,2.572,2.572,2.572,2.5720000000000005

54,Jeremy C.,"Denver, CO",195,59,23.0,2.0,2012-04-15,"Red Robin: A chain restaurant that specializes in overpriced hamburgers and ""bottomless"" this and that. Needed more flair for sure.  Despite calling ahead to make reservations for our party of 13, which were accepted over the phone, we were notified upon arrival that Red Robin does not take reservations. WTF? Fortunately, the wait was mostly bearable and nobody had to run next door to (shudder) Bennett's for some survival chow. My burger was plain and tasted fine except for the lack of anything resembling meat flavor. The ""bottomless"" fries were OK but were greatly improved by a generous dash of the ""bottomless"" imitation Lawry's seasoning salt and a few squirts of the ""bottomless"" house ketchup.  Those of us who wanted mustard had to share a single bottle that someone in our party had to go steal from the kitchen area. The tortilla soup was tepid, gelatinous, and as exciting as a trip to a gas station restroom. My ""bottomless"" root beer float was soft serve and root beer. Could any less effort be expended? The only thing good about the trip was the waiter. Except that he forgot to bring out the mustard.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arvada?start=40,2.472,2.472,2.472,2.472,2.472

The one alcoholic beverage I ordered to chase away the mundanity of it all lacked any alcohol whatsoever and tasted like kool-aid.  But it's a Red Robin.

121,Greg Q.,"Denver, CO",36,17,50.0,2.0,2012-07-08,"Went to Red Robin yesterday with my Wife and Daughter and we have not been there in a while.  When we sat down we were looking over the new menu and it looked like some really good changes were made.  Our server came over to get our drink order and came back promptly for our food order.  I ordered the fish and chips and my Wife and Daughter were going to share a Royal Red Robin burger. Both of these dishes come with bottomless fries. Like we do EVERY time we go there my wife ask from some fries to start with and some ranch. We waited and waited and no fries came. I asked the waiter he then told me it was a new rule that they can not bring any out before the meal and he said he thought it was a stupid rule and he would bring some out.  Well, our meals came and we never got fries to start with.  I asked to speak with a manager because the waiter should have given me the option to order fries as an appetizer or maybe even have my fries first and no fries with my meal or at the very least to tell me about the rule after I asked when placing my order not right before my food came,  The Manger came over and crouched by the table and started giving me a story about why the do not allow fries first and stated it was because people will ask for fries first then order a bunch of salads.  I told him that it would have been good of him to come out and ask why I wanted to speak with him instead of assume and go off on a rant about their rules even though we had ordered our food already before asking for fries so his explanation didn't really mean squat to me at that point.  This is not the first time we have had issues with this Red Robin as a matter of fact last time the situation was much worse and that is why we had stopped going there for so long.  I guess it's time not stop going there again. I understand rules and I have no problem following them but customer service is about giving options and I did not get any.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arvada?start=120,2.472,2.472,2.472,2.472,2.472

I'm not sure if they recently got a new Manager or what, but lately it has been AWFUL. One of our favorite things about RR is getting the bottomless fries while you wait for the rest of your party and look over the menu. A couple of months ago they started making us order BEFORE we got any fries. That was bothersome, but the last time we went in was the final straw. Now they are actually CHARGING $1.99 for the ""free"" fries. That's like a mexican restaurant charging for the chips & salsa. It might sound like a small deal, but combined with the terrible service we've had lately and the new look, which I don't care for, I think we'll be visiting another restaurant for our weekly get-together now.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arvada?start=80,2.72,2.72,2.72,2.6640000000000006,2.72

104,Mark S.,"Denver, CO",309,333,74.0,4.0,2013-02-18,"You've most likely already been to a Red Robin at some point in your life. Or at the very least, you've heard those annoying ""Yuummmmmmmmmmm"" commercials they've had running for the past few years. Red Robin is like an Applebee's for burgers. Often scoffed at, but they've gotta be doing something right to have so many restaurants open, right? I've been to Red Robin a few times and have always gotten the famous Royal Red Robin burger (with a fried egg on top). This time I opted for the Guacamole Bacon burger, which comes dressed with guacamole, bacon, swiss cheese, tomatoes, onion, and mayo. With bottomless steak fries it checks out at $9.99. They also ask if you want it ""pink or no pink"" in the middle, which I kind of like as a cop out for them. Besides the dirty undertones, that question leaves them a lot of wiggle room. There's no attempt on their part to cook it EXACTLY how you order it, which we all know rarely happens. And yes, you have to get a little pink in the middle. Here's the crazy part: You know how major restaurant chains take ridiculous pictures of their food for advertisements, and it looks NOTHING like that in real life (See Red Robin pic in the gallery below)? Well, this time, it pretty much looks like advertised. Cut this burger in half, and it stands up big and tall just like the pics. And oh by the way, it tastes as good as it looks. The patty is indeed pink in the middle, with slight points taken away because the ends were too well-done and tough/chewy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arvada?start=100,2.96,2.96,2.96,2.7359999999999998,2.96
45,Jenny C.,"Golden, CO",152,578,110.0,2.0,2013-04-01,"Both times I've been here, I had the fish and chips. On our most recent visit, there were very few fries included with my meal. The fish comes in 4 battered pieces, and it's decent. I found I needed to use all my and my husband's lemons, and add salt. My son enjoyed his pepperoni pizza and ate most of it. The mountain mud pie was okay, although it could have thawed a little before service, as it was rock hard.  The service on our last visit was terrible. She took a long time to greet us (besides saying ""just a minute""). We gave her our drink orders, along with our appetizer order, and told her to come back for the dinner order, since we hadn't decided on that part yet. It took a lot longer for our kids' drinks to come out. I realize that chocolate milk comes from the bar, but it shouldn't take more than 5 minutes for them to be ready after we receive ours.  We were two chips into our artichoke dip, which took a long time to come out, when they brought our dinner out. Then when we were about halfway through dinner, she asked if we wanted 'to-go' boxes and/or dessert and didn't take note of our empty glasses, which we set at the end of the table. Before taking our dessert orders, she brought out balloons, which was a nice gesture, but we would have preferred for those at the end of our meal. We ate our dessert, during which she refilled our drinks and dropped off the check, standing up. She checked again and put our check holder flat on the table ""since we weren't ready to go."" I took the kids to wash their hands while my husband paid the bill. She still hadn't come by to pick it up by the time we came back from the restroom.  We felt rushed our whole meal and we didn't enjoy it as much. It was not worth the $60 we paid for it.

The burger wasn't very good, I think they have made them smaller and the meat isn't as high quality as it was.  The first fries our server brought us were stone cold and we didn't get fresh ones until we had finished our burgers.  The service was poor and slow, which went well with the new atmosphere created by their remodel.  Even the uniforms are bland now; they used to wear bright, chearful colors, now everyone is in black.  Not sure what Red Robin is going for but I won't ever go back to this Red Robin. If the other locations are going this same direction we'll be done all together.  Our over-all experence wasn't by any means the worst dinning we'ver ever had it just wasn't Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arvada?start=120,2.84,2.84,2.84,2.308,2.84

It has those yummy fried onion strips on it. You can also order clam strips as a appetizer even though it is not listed on the menu. The one thing I don't like about places like this is the menu is to big and it takes forever to look over.

I was absolutely baffled at what happened next....he told me that I should have ordered it with less sauce, like it was my fault. The audacity of this lazy, plastic smiled, prick.

First time took me off guard and the Royal burger I ordered just sucked and totally disappointed compared to what I had remembered and loved. But that's not the point of this review... So my most recent experience was what convinced me to never again visit this RR (maybe all RR). I came because I had a birthday reward on my Royalty Card and was hankering for a delicious burger. The place was practically dead and there were many many tables open but where were we sat? Next to a huge family table with crying babies! Geez thanks. Course they didn't start crying till after we placed our order and got our waitressed pissed at us, which brings me to my next point. I was informed that my birthday burger wouldn't actually be taken off the tab, but instead the cheapest burger would be removed. Wth, how is that worth it when I order a $12 burger and my guest orders a cheapo $6 regular? So I say I want separate tabs so I don't stick my friend with a high bill because of my overpriced burger and $4 lemonade. So then the waitress totally takes on a sour attitude and starts answering with single words and dirty looks, geez. So the babies start to cry, the chairs suck, the water tasted like shit because of the recent flooding and our waitress is avoiding us and acting like a total B. Which is why I didn't ask to move, whatever, just wanted to eat and leave. Didn't even care to speak to manager since I will for sure most definitely never go back. Fries were cold and limp, burger was pink when ordered med no pink, and by the time we were done and offered a sundae for my Bday I just couldn't wait to get out of there, so I politely declined, paid, tipped (we all have bad days so who knows what was really up with her) and vowed that was the last time. I don't recommend this place. The wait-staff seems extremely inexperienced and uncaring or fake, and there was no sign of a manager anyway.

What now floats my boat is their tavern double burger. In spite of having two patties (not my normal pick), it's smaller than all of the other burgers on the menu. It's also cheaper at just $6.99 (and about half the calories and fat grams too, if you dare to look at their nutritional info). But during football season, when the Broncos get two sacks, their tavern double is free with another purchase on the Tuesday after the game! That burger reminds me of a Smashburger with muuuch thinner patties, a smaller and softer egg type bun and even a ""smash sauce"" type of condiment. I seriously love it.  I also like their rotating seasonal tap because I've tried a bunch of brews there that I'd never have picked on my own, especially a variety of Sam Adams seasonals, most of which I've liked even though I hate their Boston lager. The servers and bartenders surprisingly know a lot about their beers. Side note: if they bring you a beer and you don't like it, they will bring you something different out right away. They also have Alaskan Amber on tap which is pretty dang hard to find in Colorado, and one of my favorite basic easy-drinking beers. Another side note: this is actually an alt bier, not an amber! Yum. Their draft, well, marg and wine prices are ridiculously cheap during their twice daily happy hour which we caught last night at 8:30pm. I had a glass of wine for $2.50! My husband's schooner of craft beer was $4.

The first time I had noticed was a few months ago. We had waited about 30 minutes AFTER we were done eating to receive our check. Then another long wait for our waitress to take it. We had to put the big guy on-top the little book at the edge of the table for her to finally pick it up. They were not busy at all so we don't know what the hold up was. A Monday at 8. Then just a few weeks ago we came back. That was because I just turned 21 and wanted to experience my first public legal drink. Well the waitress we had was rude. I had asked a simple question (Just moved to Colorado). I asked her even though I am 21 and my ID says im a minor, Colorado state License, but my birthday states that it was my birthday a few days prior of coming to the restaurant, if I could still drink or do I need to wait to get a new id. She was looking around the room and said ""no you have to have an id"" I told her I had an ID telling you I am 21, but I don't have a new new one yet. Well then she avoided the question, said, ""like a glass of water? great I will be right back for you all."" and left. None of us WANTING glass of water. Well I shrugged it off, fine whatever. Well she came back IN A HURRY to leave once again. We told her we were ready to order our food and drinks. Well it came my turn to order and I wanted their fruit smoothie. She gave me a smart remark, ""You know there is no alcohol in there right?"" I could NOT believe she even said that. I told her I knew that's why I HAD to order it. She rolled her eyes! I was furious at that point. I wanted to talk to the manager, but I didn't feel like making a scene. I was actually going to let it go at that point. Well, we received our food, ate for a minute, and she brings us our check. Like really? Are you not going to ask if we would like it separate or dessert (Which my sister-in-law and I wanted after we ate). Well my husband wanted more fries. We tried catching her and she completely ignored us. Well lets just say we didn't get our dessert and she got a very low tip. That completely ruined my night. Where I am from there is NO Red-Robin.

When they got up so did the table next to them and the manager immediately came down to tell him they were putting two parties down at once. That is not a way to treat your employees or your guests.

We ordered in a fairly timely fashion but waited a horribly long time for our burgers, 50 minutes. I suspect our server forgot to put our order in. When we got our food 2 of the 4 burgers were dry, and burnt. Sent them back. New burgers came out slightly juicier, but still not flavorful. The buns were so dry they weren't even worth eating, tasted like saltines. Seriously not impressed, that's my last visit to this burger chain.

The onion bun was hard.  My son's sesame seed bun was soft.  Fries were hot and that's always a plus.

Meanwhile, my son ate his meal and no one came by for 15 min, by then my son was done with his burger and he asked for more fries. The manager brought my meal, apologized and we asked again for more fries for my son. I indicated that my son is already finished with his burger so ""can I get my meal to go?""  Cory brought my meal in a to-go box. Still no fries for my son. Then the waitress asked if we needed anything and at this point I'd had it.  I asked to speak with the manager...waited about 5 minutes. Cory came back and asked, ""what can I do for you?"" I replied, ""What can you do?"" He offered to give me dessert. Wait. 45 minutes of waiting and he wants to give me dessert? ""No, I don't want dessert. I really just want to go and I don't want to have to pay for my meal. He said ok and walked away. We waited for the receipt so I could pay, for about 5 min and the manager walked by. I asked him if I can have a receipt and he advised I could use the tablet at the table.

It sounds entitled but every other burger place gladly accommodate this request.  2. Drinks took 30+ minutes. Our party had people get the bottomless strawberry lemonade as well as root beer floats. They took forever to come. Servers seldom came by to refill so we had to be on high alert every time one was near. And my friend at first was told (after like 20 min) that the root beer float machine was broken or something and asked if he was ok with just a root beer. He said no just cancel it then, and then the waitress said ""Okay, let me try the other machine and see if that works."" Why didn't she do that in the first place? 3. Burgers also took forever after the drinks 4. When we paid, we opted to all lay separately using the tablet since it lets you split the check however many ways you want. A convenient option, except the waitress kept coming back and hovering over whoever was currently paying, which is awkward because she could totally see what you were tipping. And frankly we didn't want her to see because we were not happy with the service. So we just ended up always waiting for her to walk away before tipping.

Now before you jump to conclusions about how I am an impossible to please, one star giving monster, feel free to check my record. This is the first one star Yelp review I have ever given. I love giving out 5 star ratings but this place deserves to be my first one star review! So my BFF and I decide we are going to go out for a girls night on the cheap and decide Red Robin was a great idea for apps and drinks ( I personally have not been to one in over 3 years but my experiences always have been good before last night). We order the onion rings (which were fine) pretzel bites( the beer cheese sauce was probably a 3 out of 10 but still edible ) and the nachos. Who could believe someone could mess up nachos?? They bring out a burned mess of chili dumped on stale chips with a glob of sour cream on top. The first thing out of my friend's mouth is ""where is the cheese?"" We eventually found the cheese under the chips, crusted onto the plate. The kind of crusted on where you use a fork to pry it off and it has the consistency of the burned edge of a grilled cheese sandwich. This could have been overlooked if the chili was not absolutely disgusting. It obviously was the powdered kind that you have to add water and warm up and was not done properly because the middle of the chili chunks was still dehydrated powdered meat and beans! All this would have made for a less than desirable experience but the straw that broke the camels back was the behavior of one of their buss boys. We had been seated in one of those 2 seaters where one side shares a long bench with two other tables and the other side has individual chairs. Anyway we were sandwiched between two other 2 person parties who finished and left around the same time. The buss boy came to clean up the tables and set the dirty dishes bin full of glasses and dirty plates right  on the bench directly next to my friend and started loudly tossing half full glasses and dirty plates into it. Then he proceeded to do the same thing  with the table on the other side of us. He finished and while he was leaving he bumped her shoulder with the bin full of sloshing drink glasses  and dirty dishes  and did not say anything! I understand you have to clean up tables but do you really need to put your dirty bin on the same seat as one of your customers and then when you accidentally bump them with a nasty tub you don't say anything??  Between the gross food and insanely bad service I personally will never be back.

We asked another hostess to move tables, I was holding a sleeping baby and they put us in chairs. We asked to move to a booth so I could lay him down, she said, ""no im sitting someone here."" She was pregnant, she needs an attitude check.  Andre the busser was FABULOUS. He cleaned a booth and sat us down. He needs a management position.

13,Lance L.,"Arvada, CO",115,105,468.0,1.0,2016-11-12,"Sorry folks.  Downgrade on this place. Seriously NOT told about added charges and extras, even when I asked. First off my order was wrong. This is not the Whisky River (onion straws? Could I have a pickle?). I asked to have a few dipping sauces. ""Is there a charge I asked""? ""No"" was the waiters response. So I ordered some garlic aioli and a smidge of cheese sauce to dip my fries in. Note the picture of the amount of cheese sauce. $1.19. Garlic Aioli .75 cents. Played the Ziosk game at the table. This one I assumed was free like at Chili's. It's not. $1.99 entertainment fee? Could you please put up a little notification sign?   Free Birthday burger, which was nice, but when I asked the waiter about the charges he was like ""sorry"". People, Bad Daddy's Burger Bar is coming to the same location soon. They are truly awesome and you can have all the condiments you wish for free AND a free birthday burger. I just don't appreciate the integrity style of this type of Management.  I'm scratching my head on this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arvada,2.16,2.47,2.47,,2.3460000000000005

10,Sandy N.,"Arvada, CO",32,43,13.0,5.0,2017-03-15,"I love going to Red Robin at this location because the servers have always been nice and attentive. We always get our food fresh and hot. My parents always order the Banzai (I think that's what it's called) and I always order a regular cheeseburger. We have noticed that as soon as we get our food, we have to place an order of more fries because they give us no more than 10 the first time, but that way we get a second round of super hot fries. One time only we did get our burgers very cold (this might have been a couple years ago), but the manager at that time fixed it quickly, and we honestly haven't had any bad experiences here.   BTW, they have a Brazilian server, I totally forgot his name, but he's such a sweetheart... and very handsome, by the way! He's been awesome the couple times we got him.

2,Richard F.,"Wheat Ridge, CO",3,56,7.0,4.0,2017-08-18,Once again I have to say that this national chain is quite good! The burgers are delicious and come with fries or you can get a salad instead. I took two grandkids and the kids meals look decent and for a little more you can get an unlimited root beer float. The tavern burger is just $6.99 so not bad at all! The service was good though I can see where the place can get quite crowded. These places deserve recognition and just because they are national does not mean they are crummy. Inside is attractive though it can get noisy.  Just pick a good time and you'll be fine. The menu is large so much to choose from. I see no reason to bypass this place whatsoever!

The food was good, just what we expected from other Red Robin locations. I had a gluten free bun for mine which is drier than regular bread. It costs a little more, but is easier to eat than with a lettuce wrap. Our server, Chelsea, was attentive and checked on us at regular intervals. The manager, Angel, came through as well to check on things. He saw my boys had demolished the fries and personally went to get refills for them.

While their burgers are among the best anywhere, it's the endless friend (with ranch!) that really keep us coming back. Glad they haven't spoiled this feature and realize it's a valuable signature feature. Most locations also have very friendly and efficient wait staff (though I've had a few stinkers over the years, to be sure). In short: for kids (with their own huge menu) and adults alike, Red Robin never disappoints.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arvada,2.96,2.65,2.65,,2.774
9,Tobie T.,"Denver, CO",0,26,,1.0,2017-12-18,"Everything was going good in the beginning. We had a large group, and they seated all of us in a timely matter, which was great. Our server Rosie was nice, but we waited for our beers for about 20 minutes which was a little frustrating, but we were patient because they were busy. Food was good, other than my hamburger was a little pink and I asked for Super well done. I go to pay, and she comes around to get which items were on my ticket. I told her which ones, there were about 5 orders, I asked if my discount was applied, and made sure she got them entered correctly, which she says yup I have it all here. Then my balance comes up which is all she showed me on the screen, I pay, she added in her gratuity tip, and she tells me please take this survey for me, which I did. And we were done. I had my receipt emailed to me, and after looking it over that night at home, I was charged for things I didn't order. Kinda upset me because I repeated to her my items and she said yes I got it. I should have looked it over myself before paying, but she was so quick to get her survey, and check us out, I assumed everything was correct since she said it was 2 times. I ended up paying almost $20.00 more than what I ordered. Either someone in my group had a less amount due, or she pocketed it. Not very happy, I work in the Marketplace and eat here a lot for lunch, but I think I'm good here for a while....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-arvada,2.96,2.62,2.62,,2.7560000000000002
