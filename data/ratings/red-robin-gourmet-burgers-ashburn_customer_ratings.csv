47,Nabeel A.,"Washington, DC",61,120,7.0,3.0,2012-02-03,"My little guy loves Red Robin because they have a mascot that looks like a big giant red bird. I apologize on his behalf. Their food used to be good. Now its ""Acceptable"". You can predict the future based on this trend. I walked in for a quick dinner with my 7 year old boy. This was on a Wednesday around 6 PM. The restaurant was slow. Empty tables everywhere. I noticed that most of the servers were not very much taller than my 7 year old boy. This place is filled with high school serving team (which in my opinion leads to the other problems).  Exhibit A: My server was a kid who was maybe 17/18. I have absolutely no issue with that. Damn, I have been working since I was 13. I am in favor of ethical child labor (parents know what I mean). However, here is my issue ---  the guy had 9 colors of rainbows in his hair (do not correct me here, I am giving him 2 extra colors for his creativity) his shirt unbuttoned, and his eye contact with the ceiling was phenomenal.  Where I come from there is a huge difference in freedom of expression and just being clean and tidy. And ""unclean"" and ""slow"" is not a good combination in any video game let alone in a restaurant.  Needless to say, the guy was slow in his response throughout the evening, chit chatting with other classmates of his height, refills took a while, etc. etc. You get the point. Other ""kids"" were also chit chatting and ignoring their tables. Someone needs to fix this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ashburn?start=60,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005

My favorites are the Burning Love Burger, Banzai Burger, Whiskey River BBQ Burger, and you can never go wrong with the Royal Red Robin Burger (their signature burger). I just tried their new Prime Chophouse Burger and loved it. My kids love the Cod Basket (why at a burger place, who knows?) but I recommend if you are not feeling like burgers. The milkshakes are always great and there is so much they leave the Silver tin with the remainder of what the shake glass can't hold - that is if have room for ice cream after a big burger.

83,Matt H.,"Ashburn, VA",9,296,20.0,3.0,2013-03-14,"The service is pretty good and the restaurant is clean.  I'm just not a huge fan of the food here.  The burgers aren't very good, the fries are decent, and the desserts are just OK too. About the only thing I ever order here is the Red, White, and Blue Salad.  It's awesome!  The Maui Wings are really good for an appetizer, especially if you like sweet.  The cheese fries are absolutely nasty.  They put processed cheese under the real cheese and my boys wouldn't even touch it. I do like the renovations they made to this place.  It's still really noisy, but if you expect it, it's not a big deal.  We can still have a good conversation at the table. One thing that really annoys me and my oldest son is that they never ask how many kids menus we want.  They always just assume a 12 year old wants a kids menu.  Uh, not the way he eats.  The boy can pack away a Monster Burger, 2 servings of fries, and 2 Root Beer floats and still maintain a 6-pack.  Basically, hosts and servers a like need to stop assuming that kids want kid menus and sizes, they need to ask if every time if it wasn't made clear when being seated or when ordering.  We always try to clarify when ordering, but they still shouldn't assume.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ashburn?start=40,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003
75,Donald F.,"Ashburn, VA",318,155,124.0,4.0,2013-05-11,"Well I've read some of the reviews on Yelp about this particular Red Robin and I believe they have come a long way, since most of those reviews have been written. So as my wife and I are about to enter Red Robin we were immediately greeted by one of the hostess who also held the door open for us to enter. Next we proceeded into the store where we encountered another hostess waiting for seating requests. We told her how many were in our party and that we would prefer a booth. We were immediately seated (I think that was do to the fact that this place wasn't as packed as it normally is during the evening hours). Just a quick fyi, this place can be a bit noisy during the evening time. So if you want to have a more peaceful experience I would recommend coming during the earlier hours if possible. Ok our server (I think her name was Tazzania. I may have spelled that wrong) greeted us shortly after taking our seats. She quickly took our drink orders and gave us some time to decide what we would like to order. Finally when we were ready she took and placed our orders. She continuously checked on us to ensure we were okay while we waited (Which was good because I'm use to servers disappearing after taking my order). So after waiting for a while, but not to long she ended up bringing over a basket of their bottomless steak fries (Which I thought was pretty smart because customers don't like waiting long for their meal especially when they're hungry). After my wife and I completed the fries maybe about 8 to 10 minutes thereafter our food was served to us. I can't remember what my wife or myself ordered but it was quite tasty. I mean most of their menu items are pretty good. I haven't had everything on their so when in doubt just pick one of their burgers, I mean that's their specialty. I will say that their burgers (I'm just saying their burgers because this is their specialty, they do have other items on the menu other than burgers) aren't to die for, but I feel they are above average in taste, and fulfillment. All I'm saying is that most chain establishments are hit or miss but the key is how good are they at rebounding when issues are encountered and I know from first hand experience that if you are dissatisfied with your meal this Red Robin is quick to correct it and sometimes even comp your meal (I mean if a free meal for a honest mistake doesn't warrant them a 3 star rating then I think you may be, what people like to say where I'm from, ""a certified hater""). But then again you could have actually run into a bad server and food so hopefully this isn't the case if you decide to come here. In the end I think this Red Robin is better than it was in the past and I can say that I do have more good experiences than bad experiences here at this Red Robin.

36,Stephanie S.,"Burlington, VT",178,344,1078.0,4.0,2013-06-20,"Those who know me know I am not into fast food or chain restaurants, but I felt I had to write a review for this particular establishment in Ashburn.  My friends and I stopped in one night for a quick bite last Friday. As the place was fairly packed, we opted for a table in the bar. We were quickly greeted by our server, Ian. As I am gluten-free, I inquired about my old favorite (pre-diagnosed gluten allergy) Whiskey River BBQ Grilled Chicken Sandwich was GF. He had thought it was without the fried onion twists and recommended the gluten free bun or lettuce wrap for my sandwich. About two minutes after we ordered, he came back to say he had checked with his manager to ensure he was correct about the sandwich and found out that the sauce wasn't GF. He brought with him the GF recommendation list (there isn't a separate menu yet with RR) and I made a different choice.   I consider any server who takes the time to check ingredients for a customer without prompting is providing stellar service. I could have ended up back on steroids had I consumed gluten. I did go once previously in the last 6 months to this same establishment and the bartender then also helped me with the GF items by bringing me the list.  Based on service alone the restaurant merits a 5-star rating. I only give it a four because the food is typical American fast food-fairly tasty but not out of this world.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ashburn?start=20,2.9600000000000004,2.9600000000000004,2.9600000000000004,2.9600000000000004,2.9600000000000004

This place just keeps getting worse the more I go, and I have been visiting since at least 2008. Somewhere along the way, this location stopped using fresh meat and chicken. The food tastes previously frozen and processed. Too bad because their burgers and chicken used to be amazing 10 years ago.  This evening 4 tables were all sticky in one area like the bus boy used the same rag all evening after cleaning up a soda spill.   The ladies restroom floor is filthy and could use deep cleaning.   My biggest complaint is that even though the restaurant was at half capacity and it was after dinner rush hour, the food took forever to come out. I think it took 40 minutes.  We ordered our food when we placed our drink orders and  we were there almost an hour and a half.  This is really unacceptable for a burger joint.  At a nice sit down restaurant I don't mind the wait, but when the food is burgers and fries, it should not take that long at all.

Our waiter was inattentive - so much so that he screwed up four different orders from four different in a row during a period where the restaurant was nigh empty - as well as slow (seriously, does it take fifteen minutes to get refills for drinks that aren't alcoholic and in a nearly-empty restaurant?) Furthermore, and I don't know if this was the waiter's or the cooks' fault, but the burgers tasted exceptionally blase and they forgot the avocado on both my wife's (avocado-Cobb) and my mother-in-law's (BLTA, last for avocado) salads.  My wife's clam chowder tasted as though it was drowned in anything but clam. It took talking to the manager to straighten things out...and we weren't the only one.  In my opinion, she was the only one who earned her pay that night.

The temperature today was in the upper 90's. What restaurant doesn't have a back up plan such as a generator? I will go ahead and answer that- this one. When we inquired about the air conditioning or lack of we were asked "" didn't the hostess tell you it wasn't working""? Well would we have inquired and still choose to eat here? Probably not.  For appetizers we chose mozzarella sticks and their buzzard wings. Wings were average and sticks were well frozen then fried  battered cheese. Not much to rave about. The wait seemed long based on how full or actually how empty the place was. Waitress was very polite and checked on us often. We ordered the grilled southwest chicken salad. The portion was good size. Another member of our group of 5 ordered the Crab cake sandwich. It was good but had a bitter after taste. I had the chicken sandwich which was special ordered. It came exactly as requested. Unfortunately it too had a very strong after taste of old oil. The waitress had it quickly replaced. The after taste was still their but not to the extent it previously was. The other 2 meals were kids meals. The chicken on a stick is too small a portion for anyone over the age of 4. Mac and cheese comes unlimited but since it's all carbs the kids get full and do not request additional portions. Overall the restaurant tried to make sure we left satisfied.

Waiter mistakenly gave me the wrong size but didn't charge the difference.  Food: as most have said, it's a chain restaurant. Better off keeping things simple. ""Less is more"" when it comes to their toppings ... Relish is standard?? When ordering, speak clearly and make sure they understand you. Not the first time at this location they forget something or forget to take out an ingredient. The small amount of fries is likely because they are more filling, they try to keep them fresh/hot for you, but it does mean more trips for the waiters if you eat ""bottomless."" Kids meals are not very tasty.  Prices seem a bit high even for a sit down. Hard to compete with so many other (better) burger places in LoCo. Will say service wasn't bad. They did offer a drink mistakenly made complimentary to us. Trying to be like Chili's with the screens at each table.

Thousands of people that never notice, no explicit authorization, huge hassle to get it removed. I would have paid $2 not to spend another 10 minutes waiting for someone to walk past...and we get to the crux of the issue. These things have turned the servers into robots. They show up, get a drink order, bring you the drinks and then the next time you see them, literally see them, is when they bring you food 15-20 later. The drinks are empty, except for the top shelf margarita that was actually just sour mix but no one was around to fix it so you eventually carried it to the bar to a confused bartender and worked it out yourself. This is a superficial description of a much larger issue but I don't care enough to take my time to explain it.  It's a cultural change, the affect is obvious and it's a losing business proposition.

But last night pretty much took the cake. We were a party of ten. It wasnt too crowded on a Monday night so there were plenty of servers. I knew I was screwed when I asked for two...TWO waters and I only got one. WHY TWO? Cause I know that it takes forever to get refill.

The new menu insert showed a new crab cake sammich with ciabatta bread, panko fried lump crab cake, lettuce, sun dried tomatoes, and some kind of sauce. I asked our server if the crab cake itself was thick. She replied with an astounding yes. Okay, it doesnt look super thick or jumbo lumpy, I'll take her word for it. When I got the sandwich, surprise surprise. Granted the crab cake was fried to a golden brown color, the patty was not thick, hence no JUMBO LUMP crab meat. It's more backfin meat. It was well seasoned. The bread was dried (should have been toasted with butter), more tarter sauce was needed, and the tomatoes should have been fresh instead of sundried. Instead of making it fancy, make it good. For almost 15.00, I felt like I was robbed. It should have been a 10.00 sammich. And the fries, cmon man, crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside.

No doubt they do have some good dishes, but it's not something like ""Oh man! I am craving some Red Robin!!"" I did recently try their ramen burger and let me just say, let me save you the trouble. The outside is of course crispy, but when you bite into it, it's all soft. The burger itself is just super messy and nothing stays together. I thought the sauce for the burger was weird. It didn't pair well with the burger at all. I could barely finish half and took the other half home to finish later, but I ended up just throwing it away. It's not a bad place here, but I think depending on what you want to eat you have other options. Oh, they have a new on table ordering... tablet thing.

We were seated by a very polite hostess and greeted by our server. She looked less than excited to see us at her table; I don't even think she gave us her name. She took our drink orders. She came back delivered the drinks and took our orders. We had two kids meals and two adult meals. For it not being busy I was shocked that it took the kids' meals to come out in 20 minutes. As we sat and watched the kids eat, becoming parched bc we had gone through our water and there was no sign of our server, she finally returned 15 minutes after the kids' meals had come out. She said is there anything I can get you? We said ""umm yeah our food."" She made up some excuse, like its probably coming to the window now and ran to the kitchen, where we could clearly see our food sitting on the window. She brought it over, not even an apology. We ate the burgers which were fine and never saw her again until we were getting up to leave. I get that food can take time to cook, but 45 minutes for two burgers? and to not refill our drinks or ask? and on top of it all not even apologize for the wait, so disappointing. Needless to say we won't be headed back to this location.  FYI I am giving them two stars based on the food and the hostess encounter.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ashburn,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006
4,Inga K.,"Leesburg, VA",2,52,11.0,5.0,2017-06-01,"Stopped in for a quick bite. Jacob waited on us and gave us the BEST service I've ever experienced at this location. He was so sweet and attentive. Also, he was very knowledgeable about the menu. When I told him I was in the mood for a salad, he suggested I try the Avo Cobb salad. It was so tasty and exactly what I was wanting. I've been trying to watch my calories but he made the shakes sound so good that I couldn't refuse. We had a raspberry chocolate shake and the mint brownie. The mint one was better than a Shamrock shake from McDonalds, and even came with real brownie bites on top of the whipped cream. Jacob has a great smile, personality, wonderful with children and made us laugh. Thanks for the great experience and keep up the good work!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ashburn,3.28,3.28,3.28,,3.2800000000000002
3,Haley K.,"Ashburn, VA",5,68,101.0,5.0,2017-06-13,The best place to get burgers in the Ashburn area! They have a huge selection and they also have amazing salads. The price is great and the service always rocks. They have outstanding milkshakes and desserts. Always fresh new apps and drinks. Freckled lemonade is always a great option for a drink! Good place to bring the whole family for any kind of dinner party!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ashburn,3.4,3.4,3.4,,3.4000000000000004
19,LL J.,"Wilmington, Wilmington, CA",0,3,,2.0,2017-06-29,Not that great. Soup was cold. Server was slow and never came back to check on us. Had to flag him down to get hot soup.

18,Katherine K.,"Reston, VA",13,4,2.0,1.0,2017-07-14,"This Red Robin has really gone downhill since the last time I ate there a couple of months ago!!!  My daughter and I had dinner last night and the restaurant wasn't even half full.  The waiter wasn't attentive and I had to call for him whenever I wanted something.  I ordered a half stack of onion rings with two small cups of ranch dressing.  I got the onion rings with one side of ranch and one side of BBQ ranch.  I ordered the jumbo shrimp with ""burnt"" fries as I like the fries extra crispy.  The fries were not crispy and I had to reorder them.  The shrimp didn't taste very good.  I ordered a pineapple coconut smoothie to go.  After waiting for 10 minutes I asked the waiter if I could have my smoothie.  He said he would get it.  When the waiter brought the smoothie to the table the plastic cup that it was in was covered with smoothie it was oozing out of the top and dripping down the sides of the cup. I tried to wipe it off but there was just too much and so I ended up leaving it because I couldn't take that in my car.  I won't be going back to this Red Robin Restaurant!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ashburn,3.24,3.24,3.24,,3.2400000000000007
8,Teresa H.,"Leesburg, VA",42,28,22.0,5.0,2017-07-20,"This restaurant is close to home and great when I have a craving for a burger. The staff is always so friendly (even when they are slamming busy with big groups following local high school games). In the 5 years I've lived nearby I've been many times for a quick bite at the bar or for carry out and while the food is spot on 95% of the time (nobody is perfect), I have to say when it's been wrong they have gone way above in fixing my problem.  The smoke & pepper burger is my fav, with the guacamole burger a close second. Great food, great atmosphere and great staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ashburn,3.28,3.28,3.28,,3.2800000000000002

7,Brian S.,"Gainesville, VA",17,42,15.0,2.0,2017-08-22,"The burgers are decent enough. The service here has been consistently unreliable on the three or four visits we've had here. The Fair Lakes location has much better service. We've experienced in Ashburn hosts and hostesses not particularly friendly, waiters and waitresses that are slow and don't come by all that often, and unusually long waits for food after ordering even when visiting during off-peak times with light traffic in the dining room.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ashburn,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006
11,Billie L.,"Ashburn, VA",0,3,,1.0,2017-09-07,My Double Tavern Burger had tiny pieces of bone in it!  When we spoke to the manager about it and gave her the biggest sharpest piece - she said thank you for letting me know - no sign of concern and no apology. Maybe she is used to getting this complaint. We will not be going back here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ashburn,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006
2,Marisa L.,"Loudoun County, VA",0,101,2.0,1.0,2017-10-27,"Update #2 (10/27/2017): We just returned from what was supposed to be a happy birthday dinner for our son. The bacon cheeseburgers were very greasy and very messy. The fries were limp and room temperature.  But the worst part of the meal wasn't the food, it was the service. Aisha is one of the most indifferent and unpleasant waitresses I've ever encountered. She had zero personality and lacked a sense of urgency.  We told her it was our son's birthday and she completely disregarded that since the only singing we heard was for the table next to ours  =(  We waited for her to bring our bill but she was nowhere to be found. So we paid using the very impersonal table device. When she saw me using it, she finally showed up to the table, saw that I paid, and said something like, ""thanks"" or ""goodbye"" (I couldn't understand her because she was walking away as she was talking so her back was turned away from us.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ashburn,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005
1,Britt D.,"Fairfax, VA",151,187,363.0,5.0,2017-12-22,"Review update:  Been going back once or twice a month and sitting in the bar. Chris the bartender/waiter in the bar area is fantastic and he has an awesome beard.  It has been more enjoyable to sit in that area (though there is sports on tv).  Many props to him for being awesome! If you like touching a screen that everyone else has touched to call a waiter, or pay your bill then this place is for you!  I would hate to see what germs are growing on that thing. So gross.   But wait there is more! A rush of hot air from the overworking heaters smashes into you while walking in. Greeting from the hostess was friendly, but immediately I was sweating.  I get that it is 9 degrees or something outside, but does it really have to be 80 inside when everyone has jackets/boots on? One of the wait staff noted that they have no control over the temperature. Surely someone has to have control because I can't imagine cooking like that in an open kitchen. The staff must have been seriously dying in that heat, because I was dying.  Tables were closely pushed together and as someone gets up from an opposing table or booth, you are bumped or your purse is bumped if it is on the back of the chair.  The restaurant was loud with children screaming and on top of it being hot, It out me in a bad mood. Now I know I don't come to Red Robin for a fine dining experience, but I will never come back to this location.  A few months ago we were here and it was not like this at all. In fact, it was a pleasant experience with unlimited sweet potato fries. Can't beat that! I wish this time it was better.  What's the point of having wait staff and adding an appropriate tip when all the staff is doing is taking drink orders/maybe food orders and bringing food. Makes it easier for machines to do jobs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ashburn,3.2,3.2,3.2,,3.2000000000000006

I arrived around 4:50pm and they brought my food at 5pm, so they were very punctual.  Normally I don't have an issue with my order, but this time I ordered sweet potato fries,  no salt. There was some salt on there...it wasn't a lot, but I don't like salt on my sweet potato fries. The burger was delicious as usual.   I'm looking forward to returning to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ashburn,3.28,3.28,3.28,,3.2800000000000002
