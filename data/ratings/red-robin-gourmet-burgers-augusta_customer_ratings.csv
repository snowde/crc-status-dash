33,Samarali D.,"Augusta, ME",20,14,,2.0,2012-02-25,"not the worst place i have eaten but by far not the best. the food was lacking flavor, and was a little on the dry side. i ordered drinks from the bar and was not impressed by them at all. i wouldn't return to this place for another experience but i wouldn't go so far as to say it is the worst either (not far from the running of worst though) had a great family feel to the restaurant as it had a couple arcade games and claw machines in it. and some cute kid friendly statues of red robin. so if you want child atmosphere this is your place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-augusta?start=20,2.7280000000000006,2.7280000000000006,2.7280000000000006,2.7280000000000006,2.728000000000001
24,Jim D.,"Mercer, ME",0,4,,4.0,2012-04-19,"The burgers are good when they are cooked properly.  Sometimes we ask for ""pink"" and it comes out well done.  We would give them five stars if they would cook the food the way it was ordered.  It is hard to enjoy the dinner when one person is waiting for a replacement buger because it came out burned. The kids have a good variety to choose from,  and they are always happy to go to Red Robin. Price is reasonable for what you get.  The bottemless steak fries are always good. Can get loud on the weekend, but typical of a family setting.

The food was good with a few more choices and accommodations than your standard burger joint like salads, chicken, wraps, etc... But that's what you need from a place like this since you are really paying for the services and choices to provide to other people in your party. We have one Vegan and 2 Gluten Free people. Red Robin could not have been more accommodating to them with meal options to the manager himself bringing GF fries direct to the table- well done.  With all that said, if it's just a really good burger and more fries than any human should eat is what you are looking for, Red Robin is over priced. Go to a Five Guys and get your Burger on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-augusta,,,,,

Their garlic fries are the bomb, and they continually bring you fresh ones, so you won't leave hungry! I also love their burgers and pretty much everything I've tried from their menu. They have allergy menus available if you need them, and lots of choices for gluten free eaters! The service is excellent, and so is the atmosphere.

15,Pierre K.,"Goshen, IN",8,24,7.0,4.0,2014-07-02,So many burgers to choose from its insane. And there pretty much all good. The restaurant was spacious and had an awesome movie theme decor they even had a copy of the Kramer painting. The tvs were well placed and we were able to see the USA /Belgium.

14,Jody P.,"Augusta, ME",1,1,,1.0,2014-09-25,I have eaten here several times but tonight was a horrible experience.  We had my Granddaughter with us and we waited so long for our food that she started to get antsy and crabby. It was frustrating to see staff texting and playing on their phones while we were waiting over 45 mins. for our food. That was unprofessional and unacceptable.  I would not recommend this place to my friends or family.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-augusta,,,,,
21,Emma B.,"Hallowell, ME",1,19,1.0,1.0,2015-01-08,"Well, as promised, I had another horrible experience and thus I will no longer be a patron of this Red Robin. Two friends and I head in. There seems to be a wait for a table so we ask if we can sit at the secondary bar (a bar in the lounge area that is not the actual bar). We are told we can, so we head over. Only then do we realize the counter is filthy. Multiple plates, silverware, glasses, all over the place. There was even a spill across the bar that had not been cleaned. I literally bused the bar to make it so my friends could sit. The bartender watched me do all of this without comment. So once the bar is marginally clean. We are all facing the normal bar, so we are literally looking at the bartender, who has definitely seen us. And we wait. And we wait. And we wait. Finally, the manager comes over and asks if we've been helped yet. I say no, and that the bar has not been cleaned yet. She apologizes, says someone will be right over, and then comes and cleans the bar. She tells a nearby waitress to come help us. Waitress shrugs her shoulders and walks off. No one comes over to take orders. Finally the bartender comes around and asks if we want drinks. One friend orders a milkshake, another a beer. I am opening my mouth to place my drink order when she turns around and walks away. She comes back, gives my friend her milkshake, but gives my other friend's beer to me. I deliberately pick up said beer and give it to him. Bartender just looks confused. I again start to say my drink order, and she turns around and walks away. We still have not been seen by a waitress. Another ten minutes goes by, and waitress finally comes up. We place our orders. As always, I state that my burger must come with no cheese because I have a dairy allergy. I also finally place my drink order. We wait for our food and my drink. Food comes out, drink doesn't come. However, the manager brings me over my plate (which is typical), because of the allergy. He hands my burger and starts his spiel about ""we take your allergy really seriously at Red Robin and always have a manager bring you out your food to get the final okay"" - However, I am interrupting him, as well as one of my friends, because there is cheese all over this burger. Because it has melted and run onto the plate, it is beyond obvious to see. Conversation: Me, interrupting him: There is cheese on this. Manager: *stumbles* keeps going on spiel Me, interrupting again: There is cheese on this. Manager: No ma'am, this a dairy free burger Me: No, there is cheese all over it, right here. Manager: Ma'am, I can assure you there is no cheese on this burger. Me: *hands him plate* Manager: Oh, that is cheese. He then goes on to make multiple jokes about it, and how mad he is at the chef who screwed up. I'm mad because he obviously didn't even glance at it before bringing over my burger. Meanwhile my friends are eating and I have no burger. He finally brings me back dairy free burger and basically just joins us at our table to make jokes about what happened. Did I mention I still haven't gotten my drink? That finally happens, when the bartender comes back over to ask what happened with my burger. We then get our bills - I was still charged for the burger, you know, the dairy free burger that had cheese on it, and then they charged me for two drinks. Yup. Done with you Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-augusta?start=20,,,,,

17,I P.,"Mapleton, ME",0,15,3.0,4.0,2015-04-25,"First time visit to Red Robin. I had heard about their burgers and was looking forward to it. I ordered the mini wedge salad, the standard burger and standard endless fries. My server (Kate or Katie if I remember right) was really on the ball. I opted for a table vs the bar. I did arrive at 1130...just before the noon rush. She was super efficient...took my order...had the salad out in no time...brought a drink refill without being asked, (or asking me) checked on my meal without being overbearing or putting on a fake smile...was capable of making a circle of her tables, taking notice of what was going on...disappearing and returning in a moment with her hands/arm full of something for each table. She is good (top of her class) at what she does. Now the food...the salad wedge was very good...bacon bits, onion rings and blue cheese dressing. The burger...to me was an average restaurant burger. Not bad in any way... Could I say boring? I admit.. I ordered the plain original (lettuce, tomato etc) Burger too. Maybe I just like 5 guys burgers. The fries...original style here too ...plain old frozen steak cut fries. Standard fare. Granted, they are endless (big eaters like that). They were nice and hot. Here again, I'm used to 5 guys or even McDonald's (when they're hot) have higher end fries. I wished I had ordered onion rings as the order going by looked good stacked up on the skewer. The price was not bad $15.00...the salad was $3.00 of that and was outstanding. What I intend to do is come back again, order something different and give it another go. They boast of their burgers and fries...what do they have going for them over say...5 guys? Sit down be waited on....they serve alcohol, they have a broader menu than burgers and fries.  This store should try and keep Kate around. Employees like her are valuable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-augusta,,,,,

8,L R.,"Embden, ME",8,8,1.0,4.0,2015-08-29,"Service was quick and friendly. Wife's teriyaki chicken burger was cooked to perfection and it tasted great. She opted for the garlic fries which came out a little dry but we're nonetheless OK. I had the pretzel bites of beer cheese and they were predictably good.

The bartender was prompt with the menus she was friendly, courteous, quickly asked us if we were there for dinner or drinks or both. I did want a glass of wine it was a few minutes before she came back to us, but for a Friday night with a packed house and wait last, she was excellent. She answered my questions about the meal, was accommodating, food came out quickly, was hot, was delicious. It's clear the staff are focused on the customer experience. Red Robin has made excellent use of technology with their customer self service kiosks, the bartender placed our order with the kiosk, then showed us how to self pay using the machine. It was quick, user friendly, and calculated the tip - which I personally appreciate...the tip is adjustable should you want to tip more or less than the average. Excellent experience.

Took 30 minutes for non-water drinks and 50 minutes after we ordered the food for it to arrive. We would signal waitress and she would walk over to other tables in front of us. The ""bottomless"" refills would take greater than 20 minutes to arrive and only 1/3 of what we had ordered i.e. No bottomless fruit, only regular fries, etc. Multiple of our orders were wrong (dressings not on the side, no broccoli on the macaroni and cheese for the kids, etc. If the food weren't good and great milkshakes this definitely would have been only a one star experience.

5,Justin H.,"Salem, MA",0,7,,2.0,2016-09-10,"Stopped in around 7:30pm on a Saturday, eager to eat here due to excellent service in the past. Boy, was I wrong. After an acceptably-short wait given the time we came in, we were seated and our waitress took our drink orders. A few minutes later, two of us had our drink, our third was still waiting on his milkshake. A milkshake that took twenty minutes and two reminders to the waitress to get. Our food came out pretty quickly and was great, at least. But after the food arrived, our waitress disappeared, at least from our table - we watched her leaning against the back wall texting for the next 20-30 minutes. We finally got her attention and ordered a refill on an alcoholic drink - this one took nearly 30 minutes to arrive (and only after loudly complaining while another waitress served the table next to us), again due to the waitress apparently being too busy texting. We finally give up on seeing her again and start to pay using the Ziosk terminal. Understandably, we're unhappy and tip an appropriately-small amount. She is, of course, over to the table immediately once the red light comes on, and starts giving us an attitude about the tip amount. After a minute she realizes we're done and aren't going to talk bout it, so she walks off to another table AND STARTS THROWING SALT AND PEPPER SHAKERS ON THE FLOOR while barely holding herself together. All while the manager and another waitress or two are standing by the terminal watching her. Not a word from her as we walk out, nothing from the manager, nothing from anyone as we leave... The only saving grace for this trip was the food, my burger (smoke & pepper burger) was excellent, and amazingly actually had some pink in it when I asked for medium rare - I haven't been to a restaurant who knew what that means in ages!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-augusta,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006

Fries were hot and delicious as were the fried cheese curds and jalapeño coins. Burgers took a while to arrive, it was busy though. Mushroom burger was good, not as tasty as usual though. I had it as a veggie burger too. Waitress was nice, but the experience took a long time. Restaurant could also use a cleaning, old fries under the table and around.

Since its opening awhile back I have been coming here over the years. I have yet to have any major complaint in my many visits here. Have had the occasional slow or not attentive enough waitress but was solved as other workers brought the food to the table quickly even if my actual waiter was too busy or slow. Now onto the important aspect of the food they have to offer. While you won't get the greatest burger in the world you'll get plenty of options of toppings or style of burgers here. I like coming here to try out a new burger I haven't had before with a beer on tap and multiple orders of the bottomless steak fries. Some of their burgers they even pair with a specific beer in their menu. Not a fan of ordinary burgers or have allergies, Red Robin has got you covered with the variety of options. Not feeling the steak fries, they have plenty of other options for bottomless sides, such as broccoli, sweet potato fries, and other bottomless sides you can substitute. I enjoy this place for what it is, a burger chain restaurant that offers variety and a good place to hang with friends or family for food and drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-augusta,3.2,3.2,3.2,,3.2000000000000006
