This location, however, has a terrible team of employees.  Our service was not very attentive (didn't check back very often and had to ask twice for ranch and lemons)... the real kicker and why I give them 1 STAR FOR EVERYTHING ELSE is that when I was in last night I exchanged gifts with my friend and she left the gift bag on the table... in the approximately 7 minutes it took us to go to the bathroom and get to the parking lot and realize she had left the bag, four of the staff members had gone through the bag and divided up the gifts amongst themselves... the bartender pulled out one item from under the bar, another was hanging in plain view off the bar, a host pulled one item out from under the host stand, and the bag with the last two items was pulled from the TRASH CAN -- only 7 freaking minutes after we left it!  Finally, we never recovered the final gift bag item...some server must be enjoying her colorado-made shimmer lip balm right now.  The sad thing is, it wasn't one rogue employee who snatched the bag, the whole team was in on it -- happy holidays...

After the meal came, I could tell the burger was pre-cooked and just warmed probably to get food out quick. My wife's chicken sandwich was similar (reheated).  My thought is, if a restaurant wants to be known as a burger place and charge $10+ a burger, then it better be one good burger and this was a major letdown.

The quality of the burgers and chicken sandwiches have been solid.  They do have the same problem here that all the Red Robins now seem to have when it comes to the french fries.  Ever since they went to serving smaller amounts of fries with your meal in those asymmetric metal ring molds, I can never seem to get hot and fresh fries on the first pass.  I have a theory that they are batch cooking them, instead of doing them to order.  This is rather annoying as I would really like to have hot fries while I eat my burger, and not later, after I have finished it, when they finally bring out a new batch.  This location does do a better job than most of getting the second batch out as quickly as possible.

Unfortunately, this location isn't as stellar as most locations. The food is usually fresh and fairly quick. The restaurant is always clean and well kept. The service is hot or miss many times. We have had amazing service a few times, and some agonizingly slow service at other times and most recently. We have had to send a few orders back because they contained my son's allergens and shouldn't have. Big slips like that have happened repeatedly and make us nervous. Food allergies can't accommodate big slips, as they can be deadly. Yesterday was the 3rd visit in a row where we had to send multiple items back because the allergens were present when specifically ordered without it. The 3rd strike was it for us and we will no longer be using this location. The food quality is just as good here as any other location we have tried.
