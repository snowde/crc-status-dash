There are some servers who are average but for the most part they are all great! The server that really keeps us coming back is Andrew. I give this guy a A+ he is so polite and cool has heck. We decided to go grab a bite to eat after work and our first choice was to see if Red Robin was open still since it was late already. We arrived about an hour before closing and normally around that time you get the rude servers who want to leave. Andrew promptly greeted is walking in through the doors and politely asked where we wanted to sit not only did he seat us but he was our server as well. We were not rushed at all to leave even though closing time was shortly coming up. The food is always great and it never disappoints us and for the service!

Anyways, I would give this 2.5 stars, back in the day it was definitely a 4.  I am not sure what is going on here, but the quality has definitely gone down A LOT in the past year or so.   The quality of the food is hit and miss... usually leading more towards the miss.  Salad isn't as tasty as it used to be, meat quality is lower, and don't even bother with the seafood.... the freezer section has had better outcomes.  The service has really taken a dive recently.  The staff barely makes an appearance some visits.  Their happy hour has gone from fairly decent to totally ridiculous!  They don't have any apps on the HH menu any more and the drink list is just a joke.  They only have deals on Coors and PBR.... joke.  Only one booze special, not even a generic well drinks special....lame.   And their rewards program sends out deals every so often... sometimes the server knows about it... and sometimes the place just fails on it all together.  The current special is $1 off Craft Bottled beer.... ummm... yeah, they only have ONE choice.  One....some trendy cider.  yeeeeah. Super deal people.

As an eClub member, you receive a free gourmet burger of your choice the week of your birthday. I make sure to take advantage of that offer on an annual basis. It's my birthday and I made sure to let my server know this, then proceed to order a gourmet burger of my choice. Well, the gourmet burger I ordered was a new item on the menu. I ate it and enjoyed it thoroughly (tender, juicy, and flavorful). Then I get my bill at the end. It wasn't free... I asked my server why, to which she then informed me that this particular gourmet burger was not part of the birthday deal. Huh, well that's nice to know...after the fact. It seems that when I made it very clear that it was my birthday, instead of telling me then that this burger was not included, she let me order it thinking, ""bigger bill, bigger tip"", but who can know for sure.

So now we wait for our server.......and we wait......still waiting over 15 minutes have passed. Other tables around us have been greeted and had their drink orders taken. Our party nothing. Trying to grab any servers attention is a fail. I am irritated at this point. My mom is hungry and getting fustrated too. I decide at this point enough is enough. I tell them we are out of there. A server walks by and thanks me. I tell her thanks for the no service. I get this disgusted look. My sister gets stopped by the manager by this point me and my nephews are already in the vehicle. He tried to apologize and gave her a coupon for a free appetizer.  Too late bub! We headed over to Island burgers. Which was right down the street. We were seated promptly and our server was there almost immediately. Got our drinks ordered and the food was brought out in a timely fashion.  My burger was cooked as ordered and was delicious.  I had the Hawaiian btw. My mother ate her entire burger. She rarely finishes her meals. She had the Maui burger. Needless to say Red Robins almost soured a great afternoon with my family, thanks to Island burgers for their great services. Islands Hawaiian burger is bigger and better than Red Robins Banzai burger. I waited a day to write this cuz it would have been alot nastier.

Not one bit of hot in that burger. I mean, thats the whole idea behind it right? ""burning love"" not very good. Fries were cold that sucked.

The manager then came and apologized for the error. 15 minutes later, just as my family was half way done I get my burger and very fresh fries. We asked for refills of soda and ice water from the waitress that stopped by to see if my burger was to my liking. Waited 10 minutes. No drinks. No waitress in sight. The manager returns and we ask for refills. And a refill of some sweet potato fries we ordered. Drinks come and we wait for our fries. We finish up and ask for our check. Pleased to see the raw burger was removed from our check. We pay and still never got our fries. For $67 that was the absolute worst service and food and I was extremely disappointed.

Our table was one that is just inches from another table on either side so there is absolutely no semblance of privacy and you can hear your neighbors' entire conversations. I hated it. We should've asked to move... but we stayed. I ordered the Royal Red Robin. No lettuce, tomato, or mayo with no pink and the egg fried hard. The little tray they serve the napkins and silverware on had some ketchup on it so it dirtied one of the napkins. Gross. We had to ask for a new one. My burger was very good, but my b/f requested the peppercorn sauce for his on the side, which he got, but they also put it on the burger... He mentioned it to the waitress and she said she wrote down ""on the side"" so she didn't know why they put it on... and she halfheartedly asked if he wanted them to remake it, but reluctantly he said it was okay.

When we got our drinks, the server set them on our table and immediately walked away to another table where she proceeded to provide better service and did so with a much more pleasant attitude.  Other than the server being too rushed to even appear as if she was concerned with our table, the fact that we had to wait nearly 20 minutes to even get a chance to tell her one of our burgers was subpar was equally frustrating. We sat patiently waiting as our server hastily helped other tables and saw to their needs while being quite effectively ignored until the very moment I was getting up to go find a manager. As if her vision was based on movement or something.  As soon as our server realized we had a complaint, her ability to provide quick & effective service showed up. Weird.  We got the rest of order to go, and our server was more than happy to rush our food out to us.  With the wrong cheese on the burger.  Probably a little too rushed to get our food to us.

Red Robin might be one of those places you consider then this urge strikes. Their menu has a wide variety of burgers and sandwiches they also have a few pages of burgers that are not spectacular or gourmet-ed up and are a reasonable price. I have found very few places that have a burger that is good enough for me to pay over $12 for it. Sure you can put bacon, avocado, three kinds of cheese, different sauces, mushrooms, olives and a host of other things on top and bottom.  And make it so big that I cannot take a bite out of it without spilling out as much as I get in my mouth and using a handful of napkins before I finish the thing.  There is something to be said for these gigantic slabs of meat and condiments. But, a simple, cheese, bacon, onion, mustard and pickles, burger, with well seasoned meat, cooked just right on a roll that is big enough and of a texture that complements the burger is the way I usually like to go. Red Robin does a good job of this and you get all the fries you can eat all for $6-7. Service is usually good, I have had good and less than good at this site. Servers are friendly.  Food quality is consistent. Inside is a bit cleaner than outside. Seems like most restaurants that have an outdoor section have tables that are unbalanced, are a bit dirty, uncomfortable chairs and usually have at least one table where the people are too loud or talking on their phones loud enough to everyone to hear.  Anyway, when I want a burger that I know will satisfy my ""burger want"", I can count on Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-avondale,3.2,3.29,3.29,,3.254

Now when I ordered my bbq burger I did ask for some pink on the burger, my husband ordererd his burger the same way, he takes a bite of his and it's perfect... Cooked with a bit of pink... I bite into mine and it's like biting it strait from the package it was so pink that it wasn't even warm. We did get our food  re-done and they did take it off our bill which in all honesty I appreciated the effort of trying to make it right. My waitress was great... Just a very bad kitchen day based on our experience and those complaining around us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-avondale,3.2,3.26,3.26,,3.2360000000000007
81,Randy P.,"Portland, OR",55,58,4.0,1.0,2017-05-14,"I walked in, placed an order TO GO, and sat and waited for a 1/2 hour, while my server (bartender) who not only took my order, but passed me 30+ times during order runs forgot that I actually ordered food.   A bag with some food was delivered to the bar counter about 10 minutes after I placed the order, little did I know it was MY ORDER.  I couldn't tell what was inside, nor was it my job- did the bartender look, check the order?   NO. As I waited, looking at the unclaimed to-go order, I kept telling myself, ""no one can possibly be this dumb, no way- I've only  placed the order thru her and been in her line of sight for 1/2 hour now, and it's busy, maybe it's just taking a bit, no way, this is too obvious"" It took a stray server walking by who noticed a to-go order sitting on the counter unclaimed, me sitting at a nearby table, no food just a glass of water for a length of time to finally get it together. Absolute lunacy.   One Star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-avondale,3.12,3.24,3.24,,3.1920000000000006
78,Rob M.,"Phoenix, AZ",139,43,127.0,2.0,2017-08-08,"Really disappointed in the last visit with RR and I'm hesitant in returning; especially to this 99th/Mcdwl. Service was a bit rough but to be fair I think our server was given too much on her plate (no help). Things started off good but when the food came; mine was missing the broccoli I usually get instead of fries, and that never came. Never were checked up on until food was finished and when the server finally came back about 15-20 minutes later she said the manager was supposed to come over but they never did. As I was waiting for the check because the kiosk was broken, the booth behind mentioned something about ants; as I looked over my shoulder sure enough there was a trail of ants on the booth and upper area of where we were eating. C'mon!! That table bounced and as I finished paying, I brought the ants to the severs attention and all they did was bring a dirty ass rag over and wiped them away like it was no biggie. All in all because of the totality mess with food and ants, the server said the manager offered dessert (again never came over) but since I was leaving, the dessert was only a ""if you're still gonna stay here and eat it"" deal. No thanks! Bill was paid and a return here is not gonna happen. I've seen previous reviews here in the past questioning the cleanliness about this location and it's very possible they have significant issue.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-avondale,3.16,3.21,3.21,,3.19
91,Christopher F.,"Cottonwood, AZ",0,4,,5.0,2017-08-26,"This visit started off on a bad foot, but it really wasn't the fault of the waitstaff. It was pretty busy but not quite busy enough for the 10 minute wait for drinks, the forgetting of silverware, the forgetting of our appetizer, or the mistake in our order (I ordered broccoli as a side instead of fries but got fries anyway). I know, this sounds like it's just going downhill. However, our server was incredibly apologetic for the mistakes and let his manager know what happened. From there, it was amazing. Our appetizer was out in minutes and my broccoli in seconds. The app was comped and an additional 25 percent on top of that. It was at this point the manager went above and beyond. She sat at the table, personally apologized, and handed me a $15 gift card. I was blown away. At no time have I ever received that much sincere care and worry about the quality of my dining experience. That alone will keep me coming back to this Red Robin. The manager, Rebecca, truly cares about her restaurant and its customers. Fantastic.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-avondale,3.2,3.21,3.21,,3.206
76,Haichau P.,"Laveen Village, AZ",0,2,,5.0,2017-09-09,"I normally don't take the time to leave yelp reviews, however, the service I received here tonight exceeded my expectations and deserves a 5 star review.  My boyfriend and I came for dinner and we were served by Naomi.  Many servers do not pick up on the vibes of their tables- are the customers in mid conversation or do they have food in their mouth?  These are the moments when you should not ask how the food is.  Its very awkward trying to respond and chew at the same time.  Naomi timed this out perfectly.  She remembered our requests/modifications and was prompt in checking up on us and bringing extra fries, condiments, etc. I applaud management for training competent employees.  Naomi deserves praise and recognition for her work.  GIVE HER A RAISE.  :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-avondale,3.36,3.21,3.21,,3.27
79,Joshua W.,"Peoria, AZ",0,14,14.0,2.0,2017-09-22,"First off I love Red Robin! I've been to several locations across the country; including Virginia, Wisconsin, Illinois, California and Arizona.  This Red Robin in Avondale is by far the worst.  Maybe I just haven't had the right server yet.  I'm not sure if this place has designated servers or if they just float around?  The food is terrific no doubt, but the service is not all that great. I've been to this location roughly 7 times and every time I come it is a disappointment.   Whenever you get your table you see the waitress/waiter they take your order they bring you your order and then you never see them again until it's time to pay. The servers are very polite and neat not knocking that. I only come to this location because it's the one closest to me but I think I might be traveling further to skip this one.  I usually eat all my steak fries and order the special sauces. And this location claims bottomless fries but I always get to the bottom before I finished my burger. (Call me a fatty if you will, but if I'm going to indulge myself in these scrumptious carbohydrates with this awesome sauce then I will indulge myself once in a while.) On the other hand I had the wedgie burger, and that my friends is amazing! I normally eat my burgers with a bun, but I wanted to go out on a limb here. What caught my eye was that the menu  says is a ""protein power house"".The avocado and bacon made this burger so much better!  So if you are on the fence about trying this burger please try it you will be amazed. Would love to give 5 stars but the service...eh Hopefully you'll get better service than I do.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-avondale,3.28,3.19,3.19,,3.226
83,Michele S.,"Phoenix, AZ",14,7,,1.0,2017-11-11,"Went to this location last night for some French Onion Soup and also chose a side of steamed broccoli.  Soup was delicious.  When I received my soup, I asked the waitress if it didn't come with garlic toast.  She had to go to the back and ask and said ""no"".  I know the menu said it did, but rather than make a stink, I let it go.  If you don't know the menu, then you shouldn't quote anything until you check the menu.  Whoever she asked, didn't know it either.  Won't be back.  Very disappointed and a little upset. The waitress expected a tip, thank goodness I wasn't responsible for it this time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-avondale,3.12,3.19,3.19,,3.162
85,Janice P.,"Mesa, AZ",0,1,,1.0,2017-12-18,"This Red Robin in Avondale on McDowell is horrible - the service is terrible and the staff is worse. The worst are the server, Sasha, and the manager, Nicole.  They treat customers terribly, Sasha is the worst server I have ever seen and is very rude, and the owners of the restaurant should fire her but apparently condone her rude behavior. The manager, Nicole, will not return calls as I did want to talk to her about the terrible service from Sasha and we, like some of the other reviews I have read, were highly disappointed and will never go to the Avondale Red Robin again.  I know some of the higher people in the corporate office in Greenwood Village, Colorado, and intend to write to them about this horrible restaurant.  It gives Red Robin a terrible name which, before, I thought it was a good restaurant.  Go anywhere else but this one, as there is no question it's the worst Red Robin we all have ever been to.  To treat customers as rudely as these people have done is a horrible testament to Red Robin, and looking at the reviews of the Avondale location, others feel the same. They shorted me on a glass of wine - I ordered the 7 oz. and they gave me a 4.5 oz. and claimed it was a 7 oz. and charged me for that, and were rude when I questioned it, including the bar manager.  Our table of 6 had to get their own napkins and silverware and distribute it, it was not busy, it was 9:00 on a Sunday night. It was just horrible all the way around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-avondale,3.04,3.18,3.18,,3.1240000000000006
