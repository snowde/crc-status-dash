7,Andi M.,"York, PA",2,65,1.0,4.0,2012-03-11,"Red Robin isn't a place we go to often, so when we saw one in the mall we decided to check it out. The wait on a Saturday was longer than we expected (about a half hour), but once we were seated, service was quick. Our server was on the ball constantly offering refills and making sure our food was good once it came out. For as busy as they were, the food came out quicker then we expected and was not only cooked to our specification (a little pink for the burgers), but was hot and tasted very good. We would definitely stop by this location again when we are in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-baltimore?start=20,3.024,3.024,3.024,3.024,3.024
28,Kim N.,"Baltimore, MD",9,52,,4.0,2012-03-12,"My boyfriend and I came here for dinner last week and it was the first time I had ever been to a Red Robin, let alone this one.  My experience was excellent.  Other than the goofy freak child that kept running over saying ""Happy Birthday to me!"" The service wasn't only great, but it was quick.  We never had to wait on the waitress to fill drinks or take plates away.  She was perfect.  The jalapeno coins were awesome and the bacon cheeseburger my boyfriend got was delicious.   I'd go again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-baltimore,3.056,3.056,3.056,3.056,3.0560000000000005
2,Brandi P.,"Baltimore, MD",567,601,115.0,3.0,2013-01-16,"I've been to a few Red Robin establishments in my lifetime and this one is similar to all the rest. There's nothing that stands out about a Red Robin. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the jalapeno coins and the ABLT (avocado BLT) on croissant.. but it's not something that really makes an impact in my life. I don't find myself craving Red Robin for their delicious food, but sometimes if you're in the mood for a burger its not a bad place to go. If it wasn't local, close to my home and my parents didn't suggest it for dinner.. I probably wouldn't make it a top choice, if at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-baltimore?start=20,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003
4,jon l.,"Baltimore, MD",8,146,48.0,2.0,2013-01-16,Thus restaurant does not stand out in any way. The burgers are ok - at best. They do have a other food that is a little better then the burgers.

3,Lakeia S.,"Essex, MD",124,159,38.0,5.0,2013-05-14,I wanted to say that my experience here at this location was excellent.  We can for my son's birthday and he was so happy that he can get some bottomless fries with his burger.  The waitress was that best. She was very quick and we never had to search for her for anything.   The food was delicious.  I ordered a Chicken Caesar Wrap with fries and everybody else had double cheese burgers.  Everyone was satisfied.   Last the crew sung Happy Birthday to my son. That was a plus because alot of place don't do it anyone.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-baltimore?start=20,,,,,

25,rhiannon r.,"Baltimore, MD",0,20,,4.0,2014-01-03,"I give this place 4 stars instead of 5 because of the bathrooms.  The ladies bathroom is always annoying.  The automatic towel dispenser never works, and its really gross to use a roll of soggy paper towels that's been left on the counter.  There are no paper towels in the old-style holder that is above the garbage can. But the worst is the water.  There is no hot water.  The water that comes out is so cold that it hurts, and then my hands get numb.  I cannot imagine how painful this is for people with arthritis.  Also, how the hell can you run a restaurant where the food prep people wash their hands without hot water?  There's even a sign in the non-working paper towel dispenser that tells employees they need to wash with hot water.  This is really unacceptable. Otherwise this a great restaurant.  Food is consistent, and service is usually always top-notch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-baltimore,,,,,
5,Victoria S.,"Edgewood, MD",2,21,,3.0,2014-04-18,"Went in yesterday for lunch, which was probably mistake number 1. Place was clean but man, there were families and kids everywhere! When you first arrive, there are stairs in your face so I had no clue whether to wait at the bottom of the stairs or go up the stairs where the hostess was? The hostess greeted us quickly and sat us down immediately, so I was excited and ready to go. We order our food and that's where everything went downhill for us. The food was great and reasonably priced. My burger was huge and perfectly well done. But it came out in this small basket. I like to spread my food out so I asked for a plate. The plate took 19 minutes to come out. So I understand they were a little under staffed, so I let it go. Then, I asked for a to go box. Another 20 minutes. By that time I was ready for dessert but since the waiter didn't ask me if I wanted any, I just went along as he handed us our check. Btw, it took him 2 minutes to get us our check, swipe our card and give us the receipt. Shame too bc we usually tip 50%.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-baltimore?start=20,,,,,
0,Kristina M.,"Baltimore, MD",4,70,3.0,2.0,2014-06-12,"I give this place 2 stars because the food was decent.  The service was awful.  I waited more than 5 minutes for the ""hostess"" to realize we were standing at the hostess desk... He was too busy sitting at a table at the bar eating.  Then it took about 10 minutes for someone to come and ask for our drink order and when the waitress came she mumbled hello.  The food was slow coming out.  The waitress barely noticed my drink had been empty for 5 minutes.  I won't go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-baltimore?start=20,,,,,

19,Latosha G.,"Nottingham, MD",45,108,158.0,4.0,2014-10-18,"Red Robin....Yum! Just ate here this evening and had a delicious meal. I ordered the Banzai Burger, the one with the grilled pinapple. My burger was juicy, and the Pineapple gave it an interesting taste.My burger was a little sloppy due to a lot of lettuce and sauce. But I've always said ""The sloppier, the Better"" Overall very good. Bottomless fries were good, I even got fries to go. I got the sweet chili dipping sauce for my fries. The dipping sauce was yummy, although it reminded me of Wendy's Sweet and Sour Sauce. Hhhhmmm, I wonder if it's the same sauce? That would be weird.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-baltimore,,,,,
18,Amira A.,"Brooklyn, NY",355,707,388.0,4.0,2015-01-01,"Either they are short staffed OR someone doesn't know how to schedule employees and that annoyed me. The bartender was serving food to people at the tables. A waitress served us our food though. The bartender wasn't always at the bar which bugged me at first since I had questions or wanted to add something to my order. Mind you I went on NYE... Anyway my food was delicious. First time having RR. I had the bleu burger, subbed the garlic herbed fries for $.99. If you're indecisive about getting them doughnuts, DO IT! Ohhh baby those things were flaky, crunchy and hot! That raspberry sauce perfectly complimented the doughnuts. Forget that chocolate sauce.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-baltimore,,,,,
24,Amber J.,"Washington, DC",33,153,43.0,5.0,2015-03-08,Tried this place for the first time. It was good and so was the service. I got the gardenburger with garlic aoila on the side. There's nothing like a good veggie burger ! My review of 5 stars is simply based on the food and service. Not the environment.

1,Chris M.,"Parkville, MD",0,5,,1.0,2015-07-23,"It was by far the worst visit ever to a Red Robin.  We we greeted and seated promptly.  The rest of the dinner service was horrible: - One of the drinks came in a dirty glass; - We ordered food which took long coming out and once came out we were not asked by our waitress or a manger how it was or if we needed anything else until we were 90% of the way done eating.  The manager and waitress walked by our table too; -Why do you have all you can eat fries when we could not get a refill? also no refill on drinks?  No one cared to even ask.  -The food quality was good.  However, we needed a side of ranch for fries and more fries.  I had 7 fries given to me on my plate.  I was done them in less than a minute. -I also realized our waitress spend more time at another table and completely ignored us.  She was African American and so was the other table, and we our Caucasian.  I am very disturbed to be treated like that and not offered service because of my race.   I am highly offended by the service and plan to send an email to corporate and put reviews on restaurant sites as well as file a complaint with the BBB.   I got out to eat at least twice weekly and never had a waiter(ess) not check back on my food or ask if I need anything else.   With soooo many restaurants in the White Marsh area to get burgers (Five Guys, Red Brick Station, Della Rosas, ZBurger, BWW, TGIFridays, Green Turtle, etc,) you can kiss my business good bye, and I hope others read my message and go to other establishments that respect guests and provide equal service to people of all ethnicities.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-baltimore?start=20,,,,,

13,Karen C.,"San Jose, CA",163,507,424.0,4.0,2015-08-22,"My family and I were shopping at the mall and stopped here for lunch.  The design of the restaurant is a bit strange.  When you walk into the restaurant, you have to go up 5 stairs which is a bit weird.  They have a wheelchair lift off to the side.  Seems to be a bit of a hassle if you could not go up the stairs.  Oh well.  We got seated right away and looked at the menu. My aunt can't have any spice so she asked for a plain burger and that is what she got.  She enjoyed it.  My mom had the Whiskey River burger - Whiskey River® BBQ sauce, crispy onion straws, Cheddar.  It seemed to be very light, maybe missing,on the BBQ sauce but she said it was very tasty.  She really enjoyed the onion straws.  I had the Banzai burger - Glazed in teriyaki and topped with grilled pineapple, Cheddar, lettuce, tomatoes and mayo.  I had it wrapped in lettuce instead of the bun.  It was very tasty.  A bit messy to eat inside the lettuce but I really liked the flavors.  Their fries are good too.  Nice a crisp on the outside, soft inside.   Definitely a burger chain I will visit once in awhile.  There are several near my home in California so I definitely will check them out soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-baltimore,,,,,

23,Angelina G.,"Mount Vernon, Baltimore, MD",8,32,5.0,5.0,2015-12-26,"The bottomless sides make everything great if you are really hungry and under a low budget. But not only that the burgers are awesome. As a lady I always order the Tavern double which is the smallest of their burgers and my husband orders a kings delicacy which is the king ribbon ( I tend to steal the fried onions in his burger ). The service is great, just right now I was struggling with a ketchup bottle and the manager saw me and without asking brought me a brand new bottle. I felt really well taken care of. Thank you very much Mr. Manager:) and the waiter Steve was very careful while I order my burger without thousand isles dressing.

21,Traci N.,"Rosedale, MD",0,17,4.0,4.0,2016-02-23,"Service is always good. Burgers are good. Better than a fast food joint and a lot of different varieties. I like the app chili chili con queso, I also like the Whiskey River Bbq burger or chicken sandwiches. Bottomless fries with the special seasoned salt on the table are tasty. My only complaint is that from inside the mall, I have to go down a set of stairs, then once in the restaurant I have to go back up a set of stairs. It's annoying, but for someone in a wheelchair or has knee problems, it can be a big draws back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-baltimore,,,,,
22,Shelly B.,"Parkville, MD",7,23,,2.0,2016-07-08,"My husband and I are vegan. I ordered a Boca Burger and for whatever reason my husband ordered the garden burger. When it was served, he asked the waitress if he was seeing cheese on the burger. She told us no, it wasn't cheese. Fortunately, I thought to ask what it was if it wasn't cheese. The waitress told us she would find out. Instead of her returning, a woman came back to our table and let us know there was mozzarella in the garden burger. I then asked why, if it was a Garden burger, was there cheese in it? I guess that was not an appropriate question because she glared at me and said it was vegetarian and not vegan. That was absolutely not clear on the menu and the last time I checked cheese does not grow in a garden.  I don't think it takes a lot of effort to be clear on the menu to take care of customers who may have a food allergy. I am not so much upset about the mistake we made ordering the burger but the attitude of the woman in the restaurant was unsettling. Also, the waitress told us it was not cheese and my husband almost ate it without knowing. You can't make those kind of mistakes in food service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-baltimore,,,,,

As I walked into the restroom it smelled like rotting mushrooms well I was about to change that to rancid meatloaf but anyway as I sat down on the porcelain crap catcher I exploded in a hurry boy did it burn !

On both occasions it took over 40 minutes to get our food at times it wasn't busy. Several times the kitchen was blamed for being ""lazy."" Once the food was brought out on both occasions it was cold and it was obvious it was left in the opening for a long time. It took several requests to get ketchup and mustard.

10,Tee B.,"Baltimore, MD",94,150,211.0,1.0,2017-02-24,"They have a ""no- stroller"" policy, which I think is ridiculous. The hostess said that all Red Robin's have the same policy. Not true. I frequent the Red Robin in Towson and I've never had to leave my stroller by the door unattended. Guest with small children have two options at this location: leave their stroller by the door and pray it isn't stolen or go someplace else in the mall. My family and I decided on the latter and went to Green Turtle across the hall. The hostess there welcomed my family and our stroller.  So much for this Red Robin being family friendly.  I refuse to spend my hard earned money with an establishment that would make a mother hold her child while dining. I wouldn't recommend this location if you have children.
