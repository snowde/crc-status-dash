76,Cameron F.,"New York, NY",4,40,,4.0,2012-02-19,"Red robin has an amazing scenery inside. Televisions everywhere, many posters and other memorabilia from some of the greatest movies ever, including an American flag made of baseballs. There are also many memorable photographs throughout the course of history which is amazingly cool. It is an amazingly cool restaurant except for its attraction of little annoying children, however if you sit far away from them (because its a huge restaurant, along with outside seating) its not a problem. What is annoying though is the constant inflation of balloons at the front of the restaurant for these annoying children which is incredibly loud and obnoxious, so don't sit in the front if you don't want to hear this. And then you get A-hole parents who let their A-hole children pop the right section. What's also cool is that there is an ability to get burgers to go if in a rush. What's also great is that if you don't like what you see on the menu, you can customize a burger any way you like, but if you don't like mayo, you have to tell them not to put it on, otherwise they automatically slap it right on the sandwich. We got the onion ring tower to start, and it was fantastic. Great tasting dipping sauces with perfectly fried onion rings. It was fantastic. For dinner I got a burger with cheddar cheese, guacamole, and chili cooked well done on a sesame bun. It was an amazing burger. The chili was cooked to perfection and it was sooo delicious. The fries were also incredibly good. They had an amazing seasoning which just tasted delectable. The waiter did screw up our order originally by forgetting to place our order for the onion rings but this was fixed. I also recommend the red robin home made seasoning which is very tasty but if too much is added on, it won't taste very good. Overall a delicious restaurant but noise problems here and there.

64,Dan E.,"Branchburg, NJ",56,861,26.0,3.0,2013-12-28,"I finally got to a Red Robin for the first time ever this past week.  I've always seen the reviews/pics on Yelp and everything looked pretty good.  I've had friends also tell me how great the burgers are.  I was all about coming here. My wife and I stopped in and we grabbed a couple of stools at the bar.  They have 10 beers on tap - mostly all domestics but I was pleasantly surprised to see they had Sam Adams Winter Lager on tap.  This is quickly becoming one of my favorite beers.  We ended up having our entire meal at the bar and the service was decent.  It could of have been a touch more attentive since there weren't many people at the bar but what can you do? The menu is actually pretty big - it's basically apps, burgers and different sandwiches but they have a ton to choose from.  My wife and I started out with an order of the Buffalo wings which came served over some chips.  I was actually pretty disappointed by the wings.  I've seen them in pictures on Yelp before and they always looked really good, but these wings were incredibly small.  There was barely any meat on them.  The chips were decent - definitely the first time I've ever had wings some over chips.  The other thing I found strange is that the wings weren't served with either blue cheese or ranch - we had to ask for some blue cheese.  They could have overlooked it but I'm not sure.  The blue cheese was actually very good - it was pretty nice and chunky - just the way I like it.  I'd probably pass on the wings again.  I did see someone eating nachos and they looked very good. For our meals, both my wife and I had their classic cheeseburger.  It was a good choice.  Red Robin does a couple of things with their burgers that I really like.  First, they actually cook it how you order it.  It's amazing how many places fail miserably at this.  They also serve the burgers with shredded lettuce, pickles and mayo.  Shredded lettuce is much better than your standard lettuce and it's amazing how much better pickles and mayo can make a burger taste.  I'm not totally positive but they could have had mustard on there, too, but I'm not positive.   The burger itself was on that very good to excellent border.  Like I said before, it was cooked perfectly, the toppings were great and it was constructed nicely (i.e. it was not falling apart as you ate it).  You can tell that they use a higher quality meat than some of the other chains.  I also added jalapenos to my burger and they gave the burger a nice kick.  They also weren't the canned jalapenos - these were the fresh ones.   Red Robin also offers never-ending or all you can eat steak fries.  I guess this is very appealing to some people but not me.  I'd rather you just give me a decent amount of fries from the start, but instead, they give you about 12 fries with your first order assuming you will probably keep ordering.  Fries were good but I wish they would have given me some more.  I guess that's the point of the all you can eat, but I didn't feel like waiting around for french fries. Overall, I liked this place.  There's actually another location down by me in NJ which I'll probably hit up the next time I'm in the mood for a Red Robin burger.  I was ""meh"" on their wings and the fry policy, but I really enjoyed the burger.  I don't see how you can do wrong with one of those.  If I was rating this place strictly on the burger, I'd easily go 4 stars.  The wings have to bring my rating down, though.  Oh well - I'll still be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bartonsville?start=60,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003

Went there for dinner last night passing through Pennsylvania. Walking in the service was fine, we were seated almost immediately. Our waitress, Anja (spelling may be wrong) came over and greeted us, got our drinks within like 5/10 minutes and we ordered an appetizer. We then ordered our meals, and everything came out fine but our waitress forgot about a few things we ordered. She came over, we asked for them, and 2 refills on our soda and she said okay. We see her walking around to her other tables, and we are still waiting. She then comes over and tells us the onion rings will be a few minutes. We then asked for the refills again and the ranch dressing we asked to come out with the meal. She said she forgot and would be right over. She comes over a couple minutes later with the ranch only and we just kind of gave her a look. Said thank you and still looked kind of confused. She then was like oh your drinks. After like 10 minutes we finally got our drinks. We finished up and paid on the ziosk because we hadn't even seen the waitress in a good 10 minutes. The gentlemen behind us was complaining he hadn't seen her either. Unfortunately I needed a box and had to wait. After about 10 minutes we asked a random server for a box and finally our waitress comes over and ask if we wanted our check. We told her we were all set and she just said have a good night and walked away. The other server came back and brought the box and we finally left. Normally I don't complain but it's just a matter of getting an attentive server or not and unfortunately she was not that attentive to us.

Food has been hit or miss and service has been slow and inattentive. Had to wait 15 minutes for a second order of fries and burgers just aren't made as well , sloppy and stingy with the toppings. Everyone who ate with us had to use the bathroom immediately when we got home. I'm not sure what happened, we no longer want to go there anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bartonsville,3.4,3.4,3.4,,3.4000000000000004
3,Chris Z.,"Bryn Mawr, PA",151,165,1058.0,3.0,2017-10-29,While on a family trip to the poconos we decided to stop in. My son took the grilled cheese and fries he really liked. My lady had the California salad that had basically no avocado and was not too fresh. I decided to have a Tuscan chicken sandwich and their garlic fries. Best was my IPA. Guess if you come here take a cheeseburger and fries and a nice tap beer!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bartonsville,3.32,3.32,3.32,,3.3200000000000003
