The burgers always seem to be rather dry. It's a shame because some of the toppings and stuff seem to be pretty good. Oddly, their non-burgers are much better. Nothing spectacular there either, but not bad. Over all I'd give it a pass. I would almost give them a pass to 3 stars, except that the prices are a bit high for the quality.

I totally appreciated the suggestion from a fellow yelper to order your fries as soon as you sit down. They made a tasty (and free) appetizer.  We sat the bar and service was ok. Nothing spectacular but nothing to complain about. It was super cool that the bartender let my husband try a beer before he ordered it. Fortunately she did because it did not please his palate so he stuck to good old ___ (fill in the blank because I have no clue what he ended up ordering).

36,Allison B.,"Saint Louis, MO",137,254,128.0,4.0,2012-12-28,"Once upon a time, a beautiful princess journeyed for six long hours to visit a friend in the hilariously named town of Beavercreek, Ohio. Famished, she and her friend headed to Red Robin for some much-needed nourishment and merriment.  Inside, the princess requested a salted caramel shake and a Gardenburger patty dressed as the Bleu Ribbon (The princess was a vegetarian and loved that she could have dressed up ""burgers"" here). As she waited for her food, she noted that the air was a bit chilly, so she wrapped her scarf around her arms. Soon, a young maiden of perhaps five years approached her shyly. The girl, dressed in pink, grew wide-eyed and suggested that princess resembled Snow White with her long, dark hair and bow headband. The princess giggled and thanked the sweet girl.  The server soon returned with the princess's meal, remembering to bring barbeque sauce for her fries and an extra glass so that her friend could share the milkshake. The food was hearty as always and precisely what the princess had requested. The shake was so delicious that the princess even briefly considered ordering a second one, but she was growing sleepy from the journey and needed to return to her friend's house to catch up on ""American Horror Story."" When the time came to pay the bill, the server told the princess (after applying her Red Robin Royalty account) that her ""burger"" was free and that only payment for the shake was necessary. The server also leaned close and divulged, ""I heard what what little girl had told you, and she was right - You do look like Snow White. You're adorable."" And with that, the server turned into a prince and disappeared forever. The princess then vowed to always leave her puffy sleeved royal attire at home and only dine in her Weezer shirt and giant glittery bow headband from that day forward.

I've probably visited over 20 times and have never been disappointed with my meal. Favorites are the Bonzai Burger which has a nice teriyaki glaze and pineapple or the Red Tavern Double which showcases their ""secret sauce"". I give props that they now offer sweet potato fries in addition to their Red Robin fries. Both are good and allow for bottomless servings though I've yet to make it through one. I'm enjoying the addition of the sauce offerings as fry accompaniments. The garlic one was quite tasty! Shakes here are de-li-ci-ous!! For a non-alcoholic option try the salted caramel or for those indulging in a festive beverage, go for the Baileys shake. Spend the $1 more to get the shake refill cup.

Swamped, it is completely understandable that the server was slow and we were always waiting on something/waving him down.  Bottomless fries are only bottomless if you have a server.   The only reason we went was because of the free birthday burger?  Well you have to sign up for a rewards program or something and because our friend with the birthday didn't sign up far enough in advance, everyone wasted their money here.  The rest of the group had apparently come in a week before and done the same thing with the same server for a different birthday.  I'm sure they tipped well before but the service and inability to honor their deal was unbelievable.  We had his ID... it was his birthday... I could have paid 1/3 the price at steak n shake for the same thing and no wait.  I'm so confused.  Maybe my problem is that I can make better at home.  Or that the burgers are $12?

19,Andy K.,"Englewood, OH",69,163,4.0,3.0,2015-03-24,"One of my friends has a restaurant 'blacklist'.  Going out to eat with him is like navigating a minefield, as he consistently opposes suggestions, claiming ""stomach issues"" or any number of intestinal maladies.  If he really did have foot poisoning or the like every time he went out, he'd never leave the toilet. The reason I bring this up?  Red Robin in Beavercreek is one of the few restaurants that's managed to stay off of his 'blacklist' for years.  As such, this past Sunday we found ourselves in the crowded Red Robin lobby, surrounded by three foot high ankle-biters. Honestly?  That's my biggest problem with Red Robin:  the 'family' atmosphere.  Every time I go there, the place is utterly packed with kids, many of whom are either unsupervised or poorly supervised, leaving the servers to navigate a flood pre-pubescent weasels while trying to deliver food. But, that's not a knock on the restaurant itself, really; just my personal preference.  Red Robin's famous for their burgers, of which they have varieties in spades.  These vary in flavor and topping, but sadly enough, they all seem to taste relatively the same.  That's a telling issue, right there, when the different cheeses all meld together and the patty tastes of so much unseasoned meat. Steak fries, similarly, have come into Red Robin's parlance but these, too, seem mediocre.  Mine came unseasoned, with only the barest trace that salt ever touched them.  The Red Robin menu offered a number of (notably upcharged) dipping sauces.  I didn't indulge, though my aforementioned friend chose the ""Smoky Bacon"" sauce, which he claimed didn't look or taste the same as the one that he had ordered on prior visits.  Didn't stop him from eating it, though! I realize that this review sounds fairly negative; it's not really meant to be, but my entire experience at Red Robin echoes one word:  mediocre.  I feel like I could get a better, fresher experience at Smashburger or any number of sports bars through the region.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-beavercreek,3.68,3.68,3.68,2.7,3.6800000000000006

Well, a place that is a little more than just ""fast food"".   Honestly, I was more than pleased with my burger, and what is not to love about unlimited fries?  Crispy steak fries I might add.   I will also say that the Patron pear-toni I had was not too shabby either.  I could see myself trying several of the other burgers or just go for dessert one night (boozy milkshake anyone?)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-beavercreek,3.68,3.68,3.68,,3.6800000000000006

The restaurant was half-filled or less. It was disgusting. There were used napkins, used silverware, food scrap, crayons & other things all over the floor. During our entire stay, nobody picked up anything from the floor. Nobody brought out a broom or vacuum. I decided to address the situation with the manager on duty but I spotted him at the food window helping to get food out. The floor around him had several dirty napkins and other stuff that needed to be cleaned up as well. It didn't seem useful to address the issue with him when he was obviously aware and doing nothing.  Bad experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-beavercreek?start=20,3.6,3.6,3.6,,3.6000000000000005

You could go to this location as soon as they open, you would walk in and find the whole place packed and you looking at an hour wait.  If you're looking for a fast place to eat before a movie at Regal, I would just go somewhere else. If you've got some time to kill, for sure stop in here and get a Guacamole Bacon Burger, and eat your body weight in bottomless fries.  Also, the hostesses here are always really rude and un-friendly. All the servers I've had here have been really cool, and good at what they do.

9,Justin F.,"Dayton, OH",54,57,16.0,2.0,2016-08-10,"I was overall disappointed with Red Robin... We arrived around 5:20 on a Tuesday, so they weren't terribly busy. Our server was kind, which is always a plus, but from there everything went down hill. When we had decided that we wanted the boneless barbecue wings as our appetizer, our waitress told us we HAD to use the little electronic thing at our table. First off, I hate those things. I find them impersonal, which proved true. We submitted our order and then gave our meal order to the waitress. When our wings arrived, my wife and I were really disappointed. They had brought us their wings, but had just lightly drizzled barbecue on them whereas there menu shows them coated in sauce. When our burgers arrived I was let down even more. It's not that our burgers were bad, they were just, well, normal tasting. If I wanted a mediocre-tasting burger, we would've went to McDonald's or something... Even better was that it was my wife's birthday, which we mentioned to our waitress so we could us our rewards club to get her burger free. She didn't even wish my wife a happy birthday or anything. Not that they have to, just would've been nice to show that she cared we were there. We were also required to is the electronic thing to check out.

5,Jess H.,"Dayton, OH",82,240,283.0,5.0,2017-04-17,"I admit, this Red Robin is usually my go-to when I'm craving a good burger.  We've dined here 6 or so times, and with each experience we've had: excellent and friendly service with timely table checks, food (more often then not, burgers) that are juicy and well-prepared, and a cheap bill (great prices for the food received). This place is also very accommodating for large groups, in my case, for lunch meetings. This is a place that seems to plan reservations with their schedule, so you will still receive timely service even in a large number. (This is very important for those that need to be in and out within their lunch hours!) Just make sure you call ahead of time in consideration. :) In my most recent visit, I ordered a few appetizers: the fried pickles and pretzel bites, along with the small doughnut tower. Now, the doughnuts certainly aren't the ricotta doughnuts I know and love from a favorite restaurant of mine... But these ones help fill the void. They're very soft on the inside. However, the chocolate sauce they serve with it has a flavor reminiscent of a child's chocolate lip balm. The berry sauce is decent. If they served a salted caramel and/or much better chocolate sauce, these doughnuts would be terrific!  With great staff and great food, this place is a winner!

I started off with the Red Spanish Sangria... save your money, because it was BLAND. This drink gives Sangria a bad name. I believe it is here for a limited time, try it for yourself and let me know what you think... maybe I just received a bad batch?!? I literally went this particular evening for their patty melt, and could literally tasty the goodness of the burger, melted provolone cheese and caramelized onions, all sandwiched in-between rye bread. To me, the rye bread makes the patty melt, but to my surprise I was advised AS my burger arrived that Red Robin no longer uses rye bread and instead I received Texas toast. I am not a fan of Texas toast, and had I known prior, I would have changed my order. I didn't want to make a fuss about it, but the ""patty melt"" was not the same without the Rye bread.  #BringBackTheRye Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-beavercreek,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006
