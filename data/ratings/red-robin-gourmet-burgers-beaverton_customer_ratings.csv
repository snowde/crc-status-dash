77,Ian G.,"Portland, OR",1,9,,5.0,2012-01-18,"Normally I don't feel the need to review chain restaurants, unless I have an outstanding or piss poor experience.  Our visit here a few weeks ago consisted of excellent food and some of the best service I've ever been treated to! I came here with a group of ~10 people (family).  We sat in the back, where we were more easily accommodated.  Most of the orders were typical fare for RR - burgers and sandwiches.  I think we all ordered (soft) drinks, tea, etc. Even though the food was good, the highlight of the evening was the service.  Our waitress (I wish I could remember your name!) was OUTSTANDING!  Her cheerful attitude was slightly contagious, we were never left waiting for drink/fry refills, and she had a sense of urgency when moving through the dining room, which a lot of typical waiters/waitresses lack (not that I don't blame them). I wish I could request to be in your section for our next visit!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-beaverton?start=80,3.54,3.54,3.54,3.54,3.5400000000000005
63,Kenny P.,"Portland, OR",94,148,,3.0,2012-03-08,"My first time to red robin ! Yes, I admit it :) The service Basic service that you will get in all similar type of restaurant. Server greet you at the door. Then bring you to the table. And server will come and take your menu. Come once in a while to check if everything is OK. No complaint here. As expected :) The food I tried fish and chip with the bottomless steak cut potatoes. Surprisingly, the fish and chips were good. Crispy outside The fish were fresh and not soggy. I like it. The potatoes were OK. Try to put red robins special spice. It made it a lot better. However, my cousin's sweet potato fries were a lot better. It was also bottomless and you only have to pay .79 cent more The location They are located in a plaza where you can find other restaurant or store surrounding it. Parking were easy. They have parking lot. Strategically located in the middle of the town the atmosphere If you come in the afternoon or early evening, that might be better. We arrived there at night, and our table was dark. Even though we had the lights on the top of our table but they covered it to make it looks artsy. With lots of red color inside, eating wont be that relax. A bit pressure comes with it :) Just my opinion. Would I come back again ? probably not unless I am on road trip :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-beaverton?start=80,3.2440000000000007,3.2440000000000007,3.2440000000000007,3.2440000000000007,3.2440000000000007
37,Miwako T.,"Tokyo, Japan",14,215,10.0,2.0,2012-09-17,"We were there for a weekend dinner.  The bottomless strawberry lemonade was nice (though I admit it is getting old somehow). This time, a couple of things keep me in mystery. 1. OK. We were sitting at a table, the next table was empty, and the table next to it was occupied with a  couple of teenage girls.  In a while, a middle-aged couple was directed to the table and sat there. And, a waitress (table-sitting-person? whatever) came and said ""Do you guys want to move? I know you wouldn't want to sit next to.."" and the couple moved away to another table. At this point, I looked around to see what was wrong with the table. Did it have a pole next to it? No. Did it have an alligator next to it? No. ... Then a while later, another group (a mom and an elementary-school-aged daughter) was directed to the table. (unfortunately, I don't know if it was the same person who got the couple away or not). and noone came to ask if they wanted to move. 2. I ordered a burger on the menu that said it came with bottomless fries. I ate up the fries but the waitress never offered for the refill. She asked the  mom next to me if she wanted any, though. Probably neither is a big deal, but, combining with other experiences I'd had at Red Robins, these don't leave me with good impression.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-beaverton?start=60,3.0800000000000005,3.0800000000000005,3.0800000000000005,3.0800000000000005,3.0800000000000005

28,j b.,"Las Vegas, NV",324,53,13.0,2.0,2012-12-30,"After years of eating at Red Robin it has been disappointing to see the slow gradual decline of the quality of both the food and service.   One of the people in our party ordered some french onion soup.  What was served looked and tasted like cold, dark polluted sea water topped with silly puddy disguised as cheese.  Our complaint and request to have it removed both from our table and cheque was complied with.   Upon looking over at the food preparation area I noticed the slick gelled hair assistant manager giving one of his female subordinates a deep, sensual back and scalp massage.  Upon completion of his services, he quickly picked up our plates with his dandruff flake fingers and ushered them to our tables. Our cheeseburgers were all cold, not warm, cold and nasty like yesterdays leftover chinese food.  The burger quality seems to have declined to the level of Burger King, but without being made to order or hot. We would have complained about our cold food but judging by the crowd that was shuffling in, TJ Max must have just closed, and the restaurant was getting busy so we just wanted to get out of there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-beaverton?start=60,2.8880000000000003,2.8880000000000003,2.8880000000000003,2.8880000000000003,2.888000000000001

Service is generally fast, the employees are friendly, and if there are any problems they're fast at fixing them.  Recently, my friends and I have had an issue where when ordering her burger ""no pink"" it's come out with a good amount of pink in the middle. Each time, the waitress and manager has been quick to fix the situation, and that often includes comping her meal. (We always tip off the full value though.)  The only complaint I have at this location is the Manager? Assistant Manager? who generally has very greasy looking spiked hair. It looks unprofessional, and quite frankly as a rule of thumb would have me not coming back. (I haven't seen him the past few visits however.)  While the food is never exceptional, it's never been bad either. I don't come to Red Robin expecting the best food in the industry, but I am always happy when I leave.  I've taken to the freckled lemonade recently, and the waitresses I've had are always quick to refill it for me. (Often before I can tell them that I've had enough!)

104,April U.,"Portland, OR",0,18,6.0,1.0,2014-12-27,"Upon entering this location of Red Robin on a busy Saturday night, we were immediately greeted by the blonde female hostess. She took our two-person's party's name, she also welcomed us to check out the bar seating situation. We decided to wait for regular seating. Our wait time wasn't terrible; about 12 minutes which isn't too bad for a Saturday night around 7pm! The male host seated us once our names were called. We were directed to sit in a two person booth in the far back of the restaurant next to two large tables with screaming babies.  Our waiter came shortly and took our drink orders. We received our drinks, but no water. Then I shortly realized (because Red Robin is notorious for getting the beverage on the outside of the glass, resulting in sticky hands) that we had no napkins, let alone silverware.  Our orders were taken, and I ordered a side of fries for my boyfriend and I to share.  As we dealt with the two screaming babies and loud men next to us, our experience was quickly turning into a negative one. Our food came about twenty minutes in, and my salad had no dressing. I had no fork to eat said salad. The guy (who was not our waiter) who delivered our food came back thankfully and I asked for both water and silverware. His response? ""Oh yeah, good idea!""  My boyfriend's hamburger order had about ten French fries accompanying it; our actual basket of fries no where in sight.  Our waiter did not come by to refill our drinks, and when asked about the whereabouts of our fries he quickly said ""I'll get them right now"" as opposed to letting my boyfriend let him know to forget about it, since we were ready to get the heck out of dodge and away from the babies and craptastic service.  There was no rhyme or reason as to why we were seated so far away from every other party in booths and why we were shoved in a corner to deal with the screaming. I understand that children and babies cry or act out. I'm not asking for a child to be stoic and mute. The constant screaming just doesn't make dinner conversation that easy.  Pair that with bad service, I will not be coming back to this establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-beaverton?start=20,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.244,3.2800000000000002

I was like ok there was a group in front of me, so i didnt care. But when she came back once again from seating customers ...STILL payed no attention to me.

The waitress took forever to come and take our orders. I say bout 20...25 mins. And when she did come we ordered and asked for boxes with them as well. The food took forever as we assumed so I asked for the check right when she was putting the food on the table. She said  sorry that they are super busy.

When we got our food we packed it right away and I say she got 3 big bites from her burger and a couple fries down and her lunch was up, so you do the math.  We still tip because we always feel bad.

94,Gabe F.,"Southwest Portland, Portland, OR",12,29,16.0,1.0,2015-07-21,"I recently moved to the SW Portland/Beaverton area and I was delighted to find a Red Robin near by - I've always had good experiences at the Washington Square location when I lived in Lake Oswego. Unfortunately, this location just doesn't live up to the service I have come to expect from Red Robin.  My first experience was inside the restaurant dinning. My significant other and I sat in the bar on a rather slow Sunday afternoon only to wait over 20 minutes to be acknowledged. No water, menu or even a hello - simply no acknowledgement for over 20 minutes. My girlfriend did everything she could to keep me from leaving. That was my first service experience at this location.  My second experience, although hesitate to return after my first, was their order-to-go service. I love this service because who wants to get out of their PJ's to enjoy a delicious Raging Cajun Chicken sandwich? Unless, of course, you order a Raging Cajun Chicken sandwich and are told this item is no longer on the menu and they'll only make if for you this one time...really? Again, allow me to reiterate I have ordered this item almost religiously at the Washington Square location and no one said a word or batted an eye; in fact, they were impressed I remembered such an amazing menu item that even the cook asked if I had worked at Red Robin's before (I haven't, I just happen to think the sandwich is amazing).  Service is everything in my personal opinion. For example: if I make reservation at a 5-star restaurant at 6 o'clock but I am not seated until 6:30, it doesn't matter how good the food is because the service just wasn't there. As consumers we don't just pay for the impeccable burgers and bottomless fries Red Robin has come to be known for, but we pay for the entire dining experience.   According to an American Express survey dated in 2011, 78% of consumers have bailed on a transaction or not made an intended purchase because of a poor service experience. In addition to that, it is 6-7 times more expensive to acquire a new customer than it is to keep a current one, according to the White House Office of Consumer Affairs.  It is not just about good customer service, it is about good business. There's an old saying: If it doesn't make money, it doesn't make sense.  I think it is safe to say that outstanding customer service makes money, so it makes sense to provide it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-beaverton?start=20,2.68,2.68,2.68,2.724,2.68

59,Laura D.,"Portland, OR",0,43,,1.0,2015-08-03,"My 4-year old (who is petite and not a huge eater) was starving at the end of his ""meal.""  Red Robin has apparently chosen to pay for their remodel by serving portions that are less than half the size they used to be.  For example, they revamped the children's menu, and the LARGE kids twirly pasta was literally less than the first bowl (of two) you used to receive when you ordered kids pasta.  You used to get a free refill of the pasta, but now you can't, so you're literally getting LESS THAN HALF what they provided in the past.  They offer free refills on the ""side dish"" but it's not feasible to fill up on tiny little two-tablespoon cups of fruit. The entrée salads are also half the size.  My Avo-Cobb-O salad contained half the lettuce there used to be served on a small plate in an attempt to make it seem large; it only had about a quarter of an avocado total, no olives and no egg.  They claim there are no eggs because of an egg shortage, but other restaurants are able to provide them (and seriously, one egg for this dish isn't a huge expenditure as it might be if it were a 5 egg custard or something of that nature).  They apparently no longer carry olives at all.  All in all, the entrée salad was smaller than an appetizer, and I was starving at the end of dinner.  (I had to give the bread to my children because they were also starving). All in all, it's apparent that Red Robin has decided to cut back the food they serve in order to cut costs.  What used to be a fun place to take the family on a whim is now extremely overpriced, and someplace only to be visited if you want to spend good bit of money on a small quantity of food.  Oh, and did I mention that they ""ran out"" of balloons as we sat there?  It was between 6:30 and 7:00 p.m. on a Saturday night, and they didn't have balloons.  So, no balloons, no olives, no eggs, tiny portions....definitely two thumbs down.  (The only highlight was that for the first time in months, the service was speedy and attentive).  We will not be returning anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-beaverton?start=40,2.52,2.52,2.52,2.7560000000000002,2.52

Hard as a rock and missing the tomato, so when I brought it to the waitress attention her mouth dropped. So she ordered me a new one, it took over 30 minutes to get a replacement, the manger brought it to the table, by this time my friends burger was cold because she waited for my second order to be rushed out like the waitress promised. The manager apologized for the first bad experience but didn't say anything about the second one taking over a half hour when they weren't busy. I told him we were leaving and he looked confused like why? He wanted to charge me for the meals we didn't even eat! When I told him I'm not going to pay for that, he asked if I wanted the burger complimentary in a to go box, so I brought it home and it was missing the grilled onions and tasted like salt! Like someone dumped a whole shaker on it, it went in the trash! I know Red Robin is a corporate chain and this Beaverton location could care less about losing one loyal customer because of awful service and manager who needs to watch Bar Rescue, but there's too many options within a 2 mile radius that you can get a better $14 burger.  So see ya #rrburger #redrobin #portlandburger",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-beaverton?start=60,2.92,2.92,2.92,2.244,2.92

95,Buddy Bee A.,"Portland, OR",20,14,,2.0,2016-05-07,"I would love to give this place a better rating,but, unfortunately, there were server problems regarding communication from the start. They came to our table promptly, and took our order. My girlfriend decided on a veggie bleu cheese burger with the broccoli side. She asked if there was a price differential between the blue cheese veggie burger and a regular burger, no answer. She ordered the veggie burger. She said the bun was soggy. When we got her bill for her veggie burger, it was fifteen dollars. She didn't get a refill of her veggies, nor was she asked if she cared for more veggies. When I got my burger, it was just ok, the meat was luke warm and the sandwich was soggy. It was basically a ten dollar big mac. I ordered the garlic and herb fries. When they brought more fries after asking for more, they brought me the regular fries. I can only gather, you are to eat what they bring you. Like Manna coming down from heaven. .I also didn't receive any more water until asking twice. I mean, for 3 people two soft drinks, it came to a little more than 40 dollars. Should we have to beg for good service. I will give them some leeway that it was Friday and rather crowded. However, I felt a little used when we left the proper tip to our waitress, according to their computer., Of course, when we finally mentioned that we felt passed over,, we got a patronizing attitude, like they were putting up with the problem children at table 8. she acted apologetic and seemed now more attentive to our needs, but the horses had already been let out of the barn.  Did we have to be celebrities to be checked on every so often while eating our gourmet hamburgers and bottomless fries for 15 plus dollars a pop? My dining companions were never asked if they wanted a drink refill either.  It was clear we were assembly lined such that I couldn't help but think tourist trap. But, we aren't tourists. So, we probably won't be back because it felt like they were more interested in our money than any customer care follow up. There are a lot of restaurants that can put together fries, sauce, and burgers, I didn't like their Extra charge for specialty sauces instead of mayo?  Does chipotle sauce really do them in putting it on their burgers instead of mayo? I felt like they were in our pocket from the time I sat down until the time we left. An update:   I have been patiently waiting pretty close to a week, your deadline when someone was supposed to contact me. I made it easy to contact me. I await a representative to get back with me so we can resolve what should be resolved.

We swore to never come back after that because we were highly dissatisfied, but we did end up coming back to give this restaurant one more chance. We got a waiter that had a very long ponytail (not discriminating). He was very rude. I do not want to get into detail. He was disrespectful and rude. We came back again, and this was the last time, which was about a week ago. My mom went into the bathroom and she didn't see, and slipped on water that overflowed from the overly plugged toilet in that stall. She slipped, luckily catching herself, because if she didn't, she would have had to be taken out in an ambulance. She came back to our table and told me and the rest of our family what had happened, and we called the manager over, thinking he was the manager of that restaurant, like he said he was (his name is Eric, he is the manager of the Hillsboro restaurant). He wrote down a report, but filled it out the complete opposite of what we told him (he wrote that I warned my mom that there was water on the floor when I came back to the bathroom, but what we said was that my mom and I briefly passed each other and said hi. he lied more on the report, but I won't go into more detail. I know this because of the lady we talked to that you will learn about in the next sentence). A couple days later, we called an insurance lady or whatever she does, and she proceeded to tell us that this was not an incident and there was nothing they could do.

Only complaints are these:  While I understand they're trying to attract more adults into their establishments, they shouldn't forget what made them so popular, families with kids. They are changing the restaurants to more adult style themes, and moving away from more family-centered decor.  The other is simply the prices. Which can be a little outrageous for some of their ""higher end"" burgers. Cmon, $15 for a burger and fries, I can still get a steak dinner elsewhere for that price.  ***Now as for this location in particular, the service here is somewhat slow, and the last 2 times we've come the servers seem to be stretched so thin, that they forget things.

Literally stood in the front waiting for anyone to seat us. I counted at least a full of employees see us but yet walk in different directions. It took about 10-15 minutes until someone sat us. (I'm not even exaggerating)  2nd time - there were 3-4 hosts in the front. While, myself and two other friends of mine walked in. All they did was chat until someone finally noticed we were there.  3rd (yesterday) Her name is Jess (bluish-purple short hair) she was beyond the rudest. She first walked up. No smile, barely any eye contact and finally said ""Hi"" after ruffling around things for a moment and She asked if we were over 21+, we said yes, she said okay. You guys can go sit in the bar and walked away. We went up to the bar area and all tables were full. So we came back and waiting on her. When she came back, she starred at us but didn't say anything! So, I said- we'd like to sit at a booth. She grabbed two menus and looked at an iPad and looked around then walked off without a word. Now realizing we were supposed to follow her, she flopped the menus down and walked away.  At this point.. my friend and I were irritated. Before leaving we did speak to an manager. Even though, he didn't give us his name but that's fine. This specific location has gone down. It wasn't even packed any of time times I've visited. All the waiters we had were always AMAZING!

1,Kris V.,"Beaverton, OR",0,14,2.0,1.0,2018-01-04,"So I'm going to start off by saying this was my last meal before I do the whole 30 and I was really looking forward to a delicious burger. Well, I'm disappointed.  I have a gift card, placed the order online and asked my boyfriend to pick it up on his way home (I don't have a car otherwise I would have done it). I called to ask if I can pay over the phone, the lady says no. I ask her if I give my boyfriend the gift card number if they can run it that way she said yes.  Surprise surprise! They wouldn't let him use the gift card number to pay for the order. He ended up having to buy it off his card.  The food was cold, soggy and the burger was sill practically mooing even when I asked for it to be well done. We asked for 3 containers of sauce and receive NONE. My side dish of Mac and cheese was about 2 child sized bites, and I asked for no onions and guess what? GOT ONIONS.  This is the worst Red Robin experience I've had. Misinformation AND cold crappy food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-beaverton,2.2,3.05,3.05,,2.71
