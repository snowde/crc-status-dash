After two miserable fish-n-chips experiences in Whistler, we came back to the states and was pleased to find such a great value and tasty fish at Red Robin.  And, they always make a great burger.

65,Amanda L.,"Toronto, Canada",59,281,11.0,4.0,2013-02-27,"What started off as a really rocky interaction that would have resulted in a one star rating completely changed because of their customer service. My and my spouse stopped here after a loooong shopping trip for a much needed burger. We started with their steak fries, onion straws and yam fries basket which comes with 4 sauces and is only $5 and drinks. We got well into munching those before we ordered and before I found out they has ""just"" run out of veggie burgers and they didn't have the vegan burgers. Being a vegetarian and knowing NOTHING else on the menu is vegetarian except the salads (and I do not do dinner salads, I want a meal not a salad!) what went through my mind was ""are you freakin' kidding me!?!"" To say at that point I was pissed off was an understatement but I held it in trying not to ruin the evening, going to another restaurant wasn't an option since we already ordered drinks and appys so determined to find a way to make this meal work I began to scour the menu. I ended up ordering the turkey blt sandwich on a croissant without the meat cause it had veggies and avocado, it's about the most filling option on the menu for a vegetarian other then a burger. I told them if they are still gonna charge me for the meat to just bring it on the side (my spouse loves when this happens) but the waitress said they could work out some kind of a discount, I expected about $2 off and a flimsy little sandwich on a croissant. Well, what was served to me was a salad bar on a croissant! They like triple loaded the veggies which places never do! That alone made me happier with the experience, then the bill showed up and they gave us $5 off on a $10 meal. Now that's customer service, I did not ask for extra veggies and I did not specifically ask for a discount and they just did it as though it was normal practice. This has never happened to me before in a restaurant and I commend the management for knowing how to make up for your mistake without the customer having to ask for it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bellingham?start=40,3.184,3.184,3.184,3.184,3.184
68,Andie K.,"Bellingham, WA",2,22,10.0,3.0,2013-03-04,"Wanted to rate this place higher and I would of except, like many other places they really have gone down hill over the years. I use to come here and I remember them having a wide variety of things on the menu. Now it just seems to be burgers, salads and a few other things - they got rid of the fettuccine alfredo which use to be my favourite. You use to be able to order onion rings as an appetizer and they'd come on this huge tower - now they only give you a few and they don't taste as good. Another thing I don't like is that you don't get just one waitress. They all seem to take turns on the table and you'll more than likely end up with 2 or 3 people helping you. This makes tipping difficult and because of this I usually don't tip well because I'm not sure who i'm even tipping. Every time I've come here they are crowded and there is usually a 15-20 minute wait. I was also disappointed the last time I went here - ordered a chilli burger and it came with almost no chili and a burnt patty. The place is also usually loud. As for the pros - even though they've gone downhill they are still pretty tasty. If you get a seat by the window you have a good view and makes for a great dining experience. The place is well lit and clean.  Theres a tiny arcade area with a few games to keep the kids occupied while waiting.

52,Caitlin Z.,"Blaine, WA",0,2,,1.0,2014-09-29,"This is my second trip to this location (against my better judgement) in the last year. My husband has romanticized Red Robin Burgers in his mind; although I tried to remind him about our last (unpleasant and expensive) visit, he wanted to give it one more go. We'd been out on the motorcycle for Oyster Run, and due to some unforseen circumstances we had to return to Bellingham before either of us had eaten anything. So we were pretty cold by the time we made it to the restaurant.  We sat in the bar, and the joint was freezing. I mean, seriously, cold. Then our waitress came and went (she was very prompt at least) and we placed drink/appetizer orders. I ordered a Coke, and it was totally flat. I opted out of telling my waitress, which I understand negates my right to complain. I just didn't want to be ""that"" customer. I wish I had opted to be ""that"" customer. The appetizer came and was quite good. No complaints on that front. Ordering process went smooth and pleasant; waitress made jokes everyone was smiling. No complaint there. When the burgers arrived. . . oh my. I'd ordered extra Bacon, which I did receive; I didn't know it was going to be the tiny/pathetic bacon that they give you on your McGriddle sandwich! I paid extra for sad bacon :( Something about the menu description of ""Thick Cut hardwood smoked applewood bacon"" had me thinking this would be the good stuff. My mistake? Anyhow.... We each ordered our burgers cooked, though Hubby is a Well Done man and I'm on the Pink Team. Neither burger was warm when we received them. The fries were also lukewarm and tasted as though they'd been sat in a fry-hopper for an hour; their texture was mealy and dry. The only redeeming quality of the fries was the garlic sauce I'd ordered to dip them in. Overall, for being a place that has signs everywhere saying ""THE BEST GOURMET BURGER IN 'MURICA"", I felt I could have obtained something of equal or better quality for about a third of the price. Lesson learned: always go to Bob's Burgers and Brew when wanting to drop $40+ on burgers.  tl;dr Save your money and hit the Dairy Queen on Iowa for better burgers at cheaper pricepoint, or spend same money at Bob's for something out of this world (as Red Robin would have you believe you are about to experience at their joint)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bellingham?start=40,3.44,3.44,3.44,2.148,3.4400000000000004

I personally am not a fan of the heavy gluten free breads that are available. However Red Robin cuts the ends off of iceberg lettuce and makes a lettuce bun that works. I have also become a fan of their buzzard sauce poured all over the french fries. If you can tolerate blue cheese dressing, try dipping the buzzard drenched fries into the blue cheese. Yum. For the most part the Bellingham Red Robin doesn't disappoint. Just be aware that they are generally busy and loud.

It's hard to imagine how a place that specializes in ""Gourmet Burgers"" can royally mess up an order of burger and fries... but oh yes, somehow they did. They couldn't even get or drink order right. My burger was raw... not just rare, but I think they completely forgot to cook it and just placed it on the bun. The fries were soggy and gross.

7,Steve S.,"Ferndale, WA",55,260,902.0,4.0,2016-01-01,"After 30 years as a customer at Red Robin, I finally decided to write a review. This review is of the Bellingham Red Robin at the Bellis Fair Mall. My standard burger has typically been the bacon cheeseburger, but recently I have branched out to try other menu items. The whisky river barbecue burger is one that is also one of their better burgers. All burgers are served with bottomless fries, it does take a while sometimes to get the refill, so if you think you are going to want a fry refill, order it early. I tried to order a fry refill before my food arrived and they would not let me do that, which seems fair to me. They don't always ask, but you can order your burgers well cooked, or with a little pink if you like it on the rarer side. For the gluten free crowd, Red Robin offers the lettuce bun, which is done very well. You can get any of their burgers on a lettuce bun. For the over 21 crowd, you can often times bypass the long wait list to get a table, and just grab a table in the bar, if there is one available. This restaurant went through a recent remodel, which updated many areas of the restaurant, but overall didn't really make that much of a difference. And don't forget the free ice cream sunday for those having a birthday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bellingham,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006

29,Scott B.,"Lynden, WA",0,68,5.0,2.0,2016-03-01,Red Robin is definitely not what it used to be. Their hamburgers lately have just been OK it seems like their portions have gotten a lot smaller. They say you have endless fries but they only bring you about six or eight at a time what a joke. Why don't they just give you a healthy portion of fries at the very beginning. When you run out of fries they are never around which I guess is why when we ordered extra fries we didn't get them until we paid our bill. If you want a quality burger with quality fries and large portions for the money try Bob's burgers you will never come to red Robin again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bellingham?start=20,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004

We ordered two 22 ounce Kulshan IPAs from our server who was a female as we do every single time we eat at Red Robin.  The server brought over the beers with a two inch head.  By the time the head settled down we had 19 oz beers.  My girlfriend politely asked another server by the name of josh if he could please fill the beers all the way up like they do every single time we have had them in the past.  Josh then went over to another server and started whispering about us.  Our server was then notified and she came to our table to address our issue.  She was rude and extremely demeaning.  She told us that these were 23 ounce glasses and the always pour their beer with this amount of head.  I explained to her that we have been coming there two to three times a week for over a year and never had a pour like this.  She became more rude and obnoxious.  I said all we want is our beer the way we have had it over fifty other times there.  She rudely grabbed the beers filled them up the way they have been every other time and slammed them down on the table and walked away.   We decided to leave and take our business next door.  I am saddened and outraged that this person is serving the public.  Not only did they loose a sale they lost a customer as we will not be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bellingham?start=20,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56

I would recommend going just before they get busy because sometimes they can half-a$$ cleaning tables and that will just ruin the dining experience right off the bat.  I'm on the more petite side, so if you're looking for a cheaper burger, that will still fill you up and isn't too overwhelming to eat, I highly recommend getting the Red's Tavern Double with sweet potato fries and honey poppy sauce! Has been my favorite for five years! Would also recommend the Whiskey River BBQ Chicken Wrap!  Definitely sign up for Red Royalty, but just remember to activate it because I got into the mistake of expecting a free birthday burger with an inactivated card. *sigh* Every tenth burger is free, and trust me, they add up fast, especially if your friends aren't a part of the Red Royalty program.
