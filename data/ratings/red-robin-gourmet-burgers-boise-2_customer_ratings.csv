I ordered a medium rare burger, it came to me medium.  My brother ordered rare, he got his well done. One would think it is reasonable to assume that at a ""burger"" restaurant, the cooks know how to cook burgers.  One would be wrong...

10,Beth C.,"Boise, ID",4,49,,1.0,2013-11-24,"We WON'T BE BACK!  For the story why, please read below: Went for lunch and we got seated in the bar area for some reason (we did not request it).  Server (Clinton) came over and a little air of arrogance to start with, but this isn't a big deal to me.  He starts off by saying ""We have a really great new burger, but you can't have it today because the frozen angus patties broke in shipment.""   Hmmm.. ok... we didn't really need to know about a great new burger that they don't have. A little time passes, and the server SITS DOWN in the booth next to me to get my order.  This was completely uncomfortable to me (I like my personal space) and unprofessional. Our order comes and the food is ok.  It has been a couple of years since I have been to Red Robin, but I seem to remember the portions used to be bigger. Instead of coming by to check on us, the server stood behind the bar and kept yelling out to us to ask how we were doing (again, very unprofessional). Our check comes, and I hand him my credit card and a gift card. He returns the credit card slip for me to sign, and he never took off the gift card!  He then disappears for about 5-10 minutes and cannot be found to discuss the mistake.  He comes back in and says ""oh, I'm embarrassed, I was outside. At least I wasn't smoking.""   Turns out, he switched our bill with another table (that's why the gift card was wasn't taken off).  To his credit, he apologized. There is another 10 minutes of trying to fix the bill and much discussion about it.  They eventually decide to void one charge, and recharge my credit card the correct amount (the server told us that was the easiest way to fix it for HIM).  The hapless manager comes by and doesn't apologize. She does tell me that the voided charge should fall off of my credit card in a couple of days.  She says ""We have people call in all the time asking when the extra charge will come off the credit card statement.""  Hmmm.... the manager admits this happens all the time???   Shouldn't some staff retraining happen?? We have been to many Red Robins over many years and this was the worst experience I have ever had.  It took over 20 minutes to fix the mistaken charges.  We did not get an apology from the manager.  They should have at least given us SOMETHING (a dessert, anything!) for the mistake.  However, I guess when your staff makes so many mistakes, that might get expensive. ***UPDATE***   Red Robin contacted me about this review.  They called me and apologized for the experience.  They mailed us cards for a free entrée each.  I give them credit for such a timely response.  I am impressed that a company would take time to read these reviews and respond to them.  We will give them another try and update the review",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-boise-2?start=40,2.724,2.724,2.724,2.724,2.724

I saw a table open but needed to be cleaned up, was told it would be 10 min, then the waitress said to me oh we have already reserved that table, more wait and suddenly now I was told the table was ready the samevtable I pointed out and was told it was reserved.  What air head of hostess, Alex the waiter have turned this bullshit scenario turn around. Table is wobbly, offered another wobbly table, advised the waiter instead of moving us around is to fix the tables. Don't you think? Food comes in no napkins, no silverware. NOW we get napkins and silverware waiting 5 min. Really? This is certainly going backwards again. What a jojo experience. Chicken or burger were not hot more warm and cooling off. Not standard temp, if I get sick tomorrow we will know why. Btw close to my birthday, this is a free burger, question is, is the food cold because it's free? You'd think they would want to win the client and not send subzero food, yeah being sarcastic. Me who owns a food business knows better. Because I know how poor the wage is in this industry I tipped the waiter 30%+, it was not tip for great service but to pay him what he should earn with no tip and knowing Red Robin prev employees,  the tip is a must.

Speaking of whiskey...full bar, ladies and gents--FULL bar.  They have an expansive signature cocktail menu in addition to mixing all of the classics (they mix a surprisingly competent cosmo!).  So, while the kids sit across from you arguing about who has the most french fries (they're bottomless--who cares?!?) and who can aggressively drink their soda through the straw longest before getting a brain freeze--you can sip on your tropical rum drink and imagine you're on a beach somewhere.

Not sure when they added relish but the last time I had a burger there it was not an included condiment. The burger was just nasty. Our waitress never checked on us or I would have sent it back. When she brought the check she asked if I wanted a box.... I explained what was wrong and she offered to have another one cooked for me.

Dad got the double Tavern cheeseburger, and it was MUCH better than anticipated.  It was cooked through but still juicy and delicious!   He also got the bottomless steak fries, and those were very good. I considered getting the fish sandwich, but I opted instead for the California Chicken.  It was a nicely grilled chicken breast with a club-sandwich twist:  avocado, bacon, tomato, pickle, cheese.  Yum!  For my bottomless side, I chose broccoli.   I'm not on a diet or anything, I just love broccoli. So, for anyone wanting to cut down on white starches, diabetic, or needing other options please note:   You can substitute other things for the bottomless fries.  Bottomless steamed broccoli was my choice, and it was awesome.   They also have a fruit salad.   Buns can come whole-grain or you can choose bunless. The problem we encountered on our visit was that everything was molasses-slow.  We got there at 11:25, and there was already a wait.   But a quick look into the dining room revealed at least seven empty tables.   Did a few servers call in sick?   Or maybe a few of the cooks did, because the food was very slow, too.   Case in point:  I asked for a refill of the broccoli when I finally saw the waitress.   By the time it came, I was finished with my food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-boise-2?start=20,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003

That isn't to say try don't strike out from time to time. Sometimes the wait staff isn't as quick on the refills and the kitchen appears to be rationing fries for the next world war, but those cases are pretty rare. I have a great time at RR the vast majority of the times I go there. I don't usually deviate from the burgers, but if you're trying to stay light on your feet, the wraps are good too. The burgers are consistently delicious and many come with bacon, so that's a plus. Match up your fries with some ranch or campfire sauce and you got yourself a solid lunch/dinner/base. The beer selection could be better. Of course they may not have the freedom of a smaller non chain restaurant, but there is almost no local stuff, and a lot of taps you could find in the center of the shelf at Fred's.

She rarely frequented our table, we waiting very long periods without drink refreshment, and here is the kicker: I was finished with my meal, my wife was still eating her fries. As she had a fry in hand, the waitress came and took her plate with her fries still on it that she was in the middle of eating! The waitress simply says ""oh, are you finished?"" after picking her plate up. My wife obviously taken aback simply let her take the plate. I've never seen anything like this in my history of restaurant eating. Totally appalling and horrid service.

I don't think so), and the 2 GF meals were discovered to have been contaminated after the ladies had eaten the fries (fried macaroni was found in one pile of sweet potato fries and a batter fried onion in the other sweet potato fries).   I found out I couldn't get my original burger order when the waitress came back and told me they stopped making it but just hadn't removed it from the menu yet.  I settled for my second choice but asked for the onions to be grilled.  Disappointing that the waitress did not inform me that the onions would be an extra charge.   Our food took an inordinate amount of time to be prepared.  It was almost 45 minutes before we all had food.  Then we started noticing the problems.  Our waitress was extremely nice and apologetic when the errors were brought to her attention.  The first manager apologized and gave the cold fish sandwich diner an order to go and comped her lunch.  The second manager also apologized to the GF people and comped their lunches and told them to let him know if either one got physically ill from the food.  It was so late by that time, I told them to forget the grilled onions.  And even though it's not a huge amount, I was irritated when the check showed I was charged $.75 extra for the grilled onions (that I didn't get).  I just paid by check because by that time the whole event had left a very bad taste in my mouth and I just wanted to leave Finally, just to put a cherry on top, RR was having construction performed at the front entrance.  When you came in and left, you had to climb over tools and workers who were not inclined to move.  Our lunch hour was punctuated with loud construction sounds -- bangs, drilling, hammering -- it was like eating at a construction site.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-boise-2,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88

Craving a burger we headed to our nearest Red Robin Gourmet Burgers. I felt like this was going to a great experience.  We walk in and we're immediately greeted and seated - this isn't normal for a Sunday afternoon but I was chalking it up as a blessing, I was hungry!  Shortly after being seated our friendly waitress appeared to take our order...  So far, so good! My wife ordered a cup of French Onion soup and some buffalo chicken wings, I ordered a cup of Clam Chowder and a Bacon Cheese Burger, and my daughter ordered her corn dog bites...  Order taken and the waitress is off...  I'm feeling great now...  AND HUNGRY!   A few minutes later, our waitress shows up with a BOWL of French Onion soup apologizing for the mistake but she's only charging for a cup... Wow.  Both the wife and I are thinking we have the best waitress in the world!  My wife tries the soup and it's cool...  Not hot.  Not warm.  Cool.  We realize that by mistake she meant their was an idle soup just sitting somewhere in the kitchen that has now been served to us for the price of a cup of soup.  My wife waited for the waitress to return to see about warm or if we're lucky hot soup, but after awhile the wife just dealt with it and ate it... What felt like an hour the rest of our food came out...  Well, except for my cup of clam chowder or fries...  It also wasn't our waitress that delivered the food so when she asked the question, ""Is there anything else I can get for you?"" She wasn't prepared for an actual request.  I mentioned, ""I was hoping for my cup of clam chowder and fries...""  She responded with, ""Oh!"" And left, I assumed she left to look into my soup and fries but I must have misunderstood the response of ""Oh!""  Our waitress eventually showed up to see how we were doing...  I inquired about my soup and fries...  She apologized and went on the hunt...  Did I mention I was hungry?  Because I was HUNGRY!  The soup was delivered by a person not our waitress.  The soup was warm, not hot, but considering how my wife's soup was I wasn't complaining...  I was hungry, I would have eaten it cold.  While i was consuming the soup our waitress came by to assure me she was just waiting on fresh fries...  I sat there watching order and after order leave the kitchen with fries on their plates (we were sitting near the kitchen) as I wondered what I did to be teased...  Was I rude?  Did I smell funny? Did one of my mental thoughts make it to my lips without my knowledge and she heard me?  As plate after plate of french fries left the kitchen I thought I must have really done something...  Then out of the blue a person appeared with fries - again, the person wasn't our waitress.  The plate was so small compared to all the other plates coming out of the kitchen with fries, but, I took my plate of 8 fries and enjoyed eat bite as I reflected on my behavior...  I don't know what I did...  But I would enjoy my 8 french fries and a waitress who didn't like our table.   Red Robin uses tablets to pay by so we paid and left...  Not knowing if it was us, her, or perhaps this is just the way Red Robin does things now...   One person takes the order, various people deliver, questions are purely rhetorical, pay and get out.  Regardless, I just don't have it in me to try out this experience again...  It was painful. On a positive note: The burger was good. Wife enjoyed her Buffalo wings, and daughter finished off her Corn dog bites.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-boise-2,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72

I am a person that likes to try different places often, therefore, I have little time to visit a place twice, but when I do it's usually Red Robin.  I like the atmosphere here it's always fun and relaxing. It's a very family oriented establishment. On the wall near the bathrooms, you can get a chalkboard and play hangman, or tick-tac-toe with the kiddos. On each of the tables, there is a tablet where you can play 100 plus games (for $1.99) which keeps the kids occupied. On that tablet, you can also: pay your bill, split your bill amongst many different people, pay your bill (receipts print, too), call your waitress, and order refills. I really like that.  Be sure to sign up for Red Robin Rewards. You get a free meal on your birthday (the whole month) and two of your children are given a free meal, too, during their birth month.  The menu, to me, is pretty awesome. You're given a lot of choices plus many different ways to make your meal customizable from the type of meat, the bun (or lack thereof), bottomless fries vs bottomless broccoli, add an egg, and so on. Everything here can be made lower carb and other diets can be adapted super easily. Their app also has a customizer as well.  I've been to Red Robin in many different states and they never disappoint (ok, there was one in California that I wrote a review on... not cool). I enjoy the one in Seattle on the water.

When I ordered I was told they no longer used Boca or their veggie burger, but had combined both into a new vegetarian burger.  I was skeptical to order this because I'm very picky about my veggie burgers and in the past really only liked Boca.  However, the waitress assured me that the new patty they used was exaclty like before and that the taste hadn't changed.  It was crowded so we waited awhile for our food, but when it came I could see right away that the patty looked very different.  I broke off a little piece and could see some rice filler inside, and I popped the piece into my mouth and immediately spit it back out into my napkin.  The new patty tasted nothing like the old one and to me tasted pretty awful.  I called the waitress and told her I could  not eat that.  So I reordered something I didn't really want since I couldn't get my usual.  This time the food took so long, my husband was completely done with his meal for like 10 minutes before my reorder came.  I will say however, that the waitress was extremely nice about it and apoligized for everything.  She took the charge for the veggie burger off the bill.  But I'm very disappointed that Red Robin no longer carries a Boca.  Because of this, I really have no reason to go here again and will have to find a new ""burger"" place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-boise-2,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
48,Scott S.,"Boise, ID",0,14,,2.0,2017-12-08,"Ate at Red Robin (Milwaukee Rd Boise) yesterday.  Atmosphere was great.  Server was great. No wait. But the food has really gone downhill since my last visit.   Fries were not crispy,  I get they will bring an unlimited supply, but what is the use of they are soggy?!?  My BLTA had completely wilted shredded lettuce (like already orange - wilted!).  I scooped it off the sandwich altogether.  Gross !  We commented. That if you would never eat lettuce like that at home, then it should not be served to patrons!  One teeny piece of bacon on the whole sandwich.  And the bottom half of the croissant was hardening.   We also got a burger that was fine.  Not great but fine.  Fries were bad on that plate as well.    Not a great meal.  Neither of us got sick so call that a win?.?.?.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-boise-2,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68
46,James S.,"Boise, ID",18,9,5.0,4.0,2017-12-27,Hard to beat their Tavern doubles plenty of burger cook the way you want it. Many styles and bottomless fries or bottomless salad or bottomless steamed vegetables. Quite a deal at $6.99!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-boise-2,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
