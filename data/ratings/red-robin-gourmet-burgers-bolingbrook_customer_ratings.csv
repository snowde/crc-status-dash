The onion rings are unctuous as hell, but very tasty, and the fries (I stole some of my daughter's) are quite nice and bottomless, or endless, as it where.

50,Nina C.,"Bolingbrook, IL",0,8,,5.0,2014-07-11,"I go to red robin about 5 times a year, this time with my hubby, We went on a Friday, early (before noon) and were seated quickly.  Our server (Angelica) took our drink orders and asked for the rewards card. It came as no surprise that one of us was due for the birthday burger.  The food arrived about 10 or more minutes later (due to no pink, etc.). I ordered the Sateed 'Shroom with a dipping sauce (garlic) and he ordered the Royal. They both were pretty darned good and came with the cup o'fries. I love that they are sticking to the platter shaped dish and not that dreaded flimsy basket.  The burgers were superb although I prefer the mushrooms at Hardee's over red robin.  Could be that they (Hardee's) uses salt, which could be bad for me anyhoo. We were offered extra fries, but declined.  We also passed on desert although I would have liked to try that one that has everything (includes strawberries and berry sauce). No room to put it away, LOL. We were two burgers away from getting that free one, but I guess even the free burger counts, so next time, we get a free one as well.  I really like that place although it should be noted that if you go with a group of people, you may have to wait longer for your food.  There was a table of 6 men near us and their food took a little longer than they thought it would.  Bigger order, etc.  Not the place to go to if you're on the clock.  It's not fast food :D.  Also, if you don't have your rewards card on you, you can just give them your phone number.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bolingbrook?start=40,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.356,3.2800000000000002

26,Bonna M.,"Naperville, IL",37,146,44.0,2.0,2014-12-19,"We visited this location before seeing a movie in Bolingbrook a few weeks ago.  I had a coupon for a free shake and the family was in the mood for burgers.    The parking lot is fairly large, bar area looked clean and roomy and the restaurant was very chain like with lots of booths and TV sets.  We were seated right when we walked in the door and given their new menu.  About 5 minutes later our server arrived and  seemed less than thrilled to be there.  We ordered a mega shake for our daughter and pops/water for the rest of us along with a pretzel appetizer.  It took about 5 minutes for her to bring the pop/water but no milkshake, she said they were working on it.  Our pretzel appetizer arrived about 5 minutes after our drinks and was warm and the cheese sauce it came with was really, really good.  She came back to the table and took our order.  Most of us got burgers except for our son who ordered kids chicken tenders and fries.  About 15 minutes passed and still no milkshake and no server.  About another 5 to 10 minutes passed and they brought our food out.  The burgers are not like they used to be.  They are more like glorified McDonalds burgers and not cooked to order AT ALL!  Very disappointing.  Still...no milkshake.  Our server finally was in view and we flagged her down asking about the missing shake. She said that they were really backed up and working on it.  Yeh, I don't think so, the restaurant wasn't that crowded and there were very few milkshakes on anyone's table.  Because it had already taken too long I asked for our bill so we could make the movie.  When she brought the bill she also brought the shake.  If it wasn't already free I would've asked for it to be returned.   I really don't think we'll be back.  It's just too much of a chain restaurant and isn't that good for the price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bolingbrook?start=20,3.32,3.32,3.32,2.12,3.3200000000000003

We were greeted by a hostess who seated us at a booth, where we waited for about 10 minutes, making eye contact with multiple servers, before we stopped one to help us. The server we stopped took our drink order and brought us drinks rapidly, and notified a server to take care of us. We ordered a couple burgers, which were delivered in a timely manner, however the burgers were dropped by a server who didn't say a word or ask if we needed any thing else. We had NO napkins, silverware, and empty condiment bottles. After waiting 5min for our server to come check on us, my honey stopped a server to ask for napkins because I refuse to touch my food without a napkin, but THAT server never brought us napkins. Our server finally came over about 10 min after food delivery, which food is now cold, but he promptly brought napkins. Taste of the burger, overall, was good - even though it was now cold. Our server asked if we'd like more fries, which was nice, considering they were warm.  We left, I was very bummed. Being in the food service industry for seven years, I know my way around restaurants - and this entire experience was a total and utter shame. I will not be going back to this establishment, no care for customers were given, in my opinion. In addition, I got sick from the food, but that happens...

47,John G.,"Bolingbrook, IL",0,30,,1.0,2015-12-13,"This location is one of the worst and I wouldn't be surprised if it closed soon. It took forever for a waitress to even come by the table after we were seated and then we had to page one to get napkins and silverware after we received our appetizer.  It seems the manager is stingy on these and only provides silverware if you ask for it or he thinks you need it.  Drink refills were non-existent.  Portions keep shrinking.  I used to walk away with half a crispy chicken salad for $12 and now it is not even a meal.  And forget about asking for extra dressing, which they used to just offer.  I think the location is losing money and the operator is cutting back to try to survive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bolingbrook?start=40,2.56,2.56,2.56,2.6600000000000006,2.56

I did like that this location was much less crowded than Orland, and I'd be willing to drive a bit further in order to have a slightly less hectic meal.  We ordered the pretzel bites appetizer and they were perfect. Burgers were made to order, and arrived promptly. Our server was fine, but not the best. We ordered a refill of the bottomless fries and by the time they arrived we were ready for the check. Drink refills were slow going as well, even though there were maybe 8 full tables at the time. The price is high, which is one reason why we don't come here all that often.

8,Daniel Y.,"Chicago, IL",425,311,2254.0,2.0,2016-03-07,"I used to like Red Robin many years ago when I was younger and was indifferent about ingredients and quality. Now that I look back and visiting this establishment over the weekend, I'm disappointed at what Red Robin has turned into. Tablets on every table. An entertainment fee ($1.99) tacked on to the bill as soon as your kids start tapping away at games on the tablet that no one mentions. I'm an attentive parent, but come on... it's way too easy and fast for this extra charge to be activated. Lesson learned. The burgers have gotten smaller since I last visited (over 5 years ago.) Competition from places like Wendy's and Five Guys doesn't seem to have put any pressure on this place. If you want a good burger that's not frozen, check out those places. While Red Robin caters to families, offers some nice deals, and has plenty of space for patrons, I would much rather suggest you spend your money at other establishments that pay more attention to your food than this place.

We had a substantial group of 10. To make sure we would have seating we decided to call ahead. After waiting on hold for 10, yes 10, minutes we were told they had a table ready and waiting for us all we needed to do was show up. So we did. When we showed up we were told that our table had been given away to a group of 12. Not cool Red Robin; not cool. They told us that they don't hold tables. Okay, well then don't tell me that there is a table ready and waiting for me. Grrrrrrr. So we waited another 20 minutes.  The only redeemable thing about this experience was A. Our waitress and B. Their ""Nacho Tavern Burger."" There were crunchy bits of tortillas embellishing the spicy pepper jack cheese. It was so surprisingly amazing. And the sweet potato fries are quite exquisite.

I thought it was pretty good. I ordered a california chicken sandwich that had bacon cheese tomatoe and avocado.  It was good but I felt like the chicken could of been seasoned a little more.  The fries were standard steak fries and the fruit was pretty good.  It was mostly apples.  I wouldnt mind coming here again but dont think I will be craving it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bolingbrook,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
