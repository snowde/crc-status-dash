The food was average but the service was bad! the last time we were there, we could not stay for long as our one year old was cranky and we had to leave without eating. We put the food in boxes and left. As we got into the car, we realised that we forgot the boxes at the table where we were seated. We went back and the table was cleared and on asking the hostess, we are 'informed' that the policy is to dispose everything on the table once the customer leaves!  Surprising! it took us 2minutes to return! So we had to pay for all that food and have nothing to eat! we vowed never to return and had to have some lunch elsewhere! Bye Bye Red Robin - never flying your way again..

As a vegetarian, I appreciate that they have two different types of veggie burgers (garden and Boca) and that you can add any of the huge selection of toppings you want. I am a fan of the 5 alarm and the whiskey river styles. The onion straws are delicious as are the fried jalapenos.  They recently added hummus and sweet potato fries to their menu, which is a great touch. I give Red Robin a 5 because it reaches this standard: If anyone recommends Red Robin for lunch or dinner, I never say, ""no"" and always look forward to the meal.

86,Miranda C.,"Bothell, WA",0,17,,1.0,2014-01-14,"My friends and I stopped by here for dinner this evening. I ordered the Garden Burger with a Boca patty (because I dislike Gardenburgers), and we asked for our bill to be split two ways. The waitress said okay, and took our order.  When the food arrived, I noticed my burger had a Gardenburger patty, not a Boca. We had all ordered sauces on the side, and we only got one of them and ranch dressing (We didn't ask for Ranch.). They sent it back, and I received my Boca patty and we got our sauces. Not only was I unaware that it was a Boca because it looked exactly the same as the previous burger(Boca burgers are typically a dark brown), but it was very cold and oddly watery when I took a bite, so I sent it back again. I declined their offer to remake it or get me anything else since I have a bit of food-related anxiety and wanted to stick with something meatless. I was going to eat the fries, but they took those away as well as the burgers both times. From then on, the waitress ignored me and my other female friend. She brought a small basket of fries to the gentlemen at our table, and refilled only their water, despite me and my friend having less than half a glass each and theirs being nearly full. It seemed as if she knew she wouldn't get a tip from me and my friend (who was kindly covering my tab), so she was trying to get on our boyfriends' good sides. My friends noticed this, and we discussed it afterward. I always feel bad when I'm unable to tip, but I didn't feel as bad this time. She also did not split our tab as we had requested. We gave up, and just asked her to split it evenly between two of my friends, who were treating my boyfriend and me to dinner.

It took 9 minutes from when we sat down to be acknowledged, which then we would have had to look at menu and spend more time before eating.  Fortunately we have come enough that we knew what we wanted and just ordered then.... 27 minutes later (and after seeing others get their food) my wife asked wth was going on.  We were told they had computer issues, and it was coming right out (computer issues I guess only impacted some)... Then the food comes out and my wife's is messed up (bun instead of lettuce wraps).  They leave the fries which she eats prior to getting her burger (only took like 5 minutes or so). My avo-cobb-o salad was great as always and the cup of chili was decent.  However waiting 45 late at night, when we are already hungry, for a salad and a simple burger was horrible. The manager came and apologized (he knew we were pissed) and my wife's burger was comped.  That was nice of them, but seriously it is the time that was the issue. Due to the principal of ruining my night, I do not think we will go back there, or we will at least try not to.  We will still go back to Red Robin as there food is always good and they are usually consistent.  It is just too bad this is the most convenient location for us, and never really busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bothell?start=60,2.76,2.76,2.76,2.9520000000000004,2.76

There was food under my chair. The restaurant had underwent a remodel since we were there last and it has reduced the dining area into an even more tightly packed and uncomfortably hot eating area. The restaurant had, apparently, decided to reduce their wait staff in favor of new machines that allows either younger, or more knowledgeable, customers to order and pay from their table, with a credit card. This was a big issue for us as it took at least 20 to 25 minutes for someone to acknowledge and wait on us. The person wasn't our server, but cared enough to help. She apologized and explained that there was reduced staff that day, a fact our primary Waitperson enhanced when he pointed out the new machines. The only complaint about the two waitpeople's joint service was that neither brought us water. My mother's burger was a little bland and somewhat smaller then it used to be. My own burger seemed to be about .50 to .75 cents more then it used to be and was slightly underwhelming.  The Campfire sauce and onion rings were good as always. I may go to another Red Robin in the future in the hopes that it wasn't remodelled and forced to lay off experienced waitstaff in exchange for the so called 'convenience' of the tabletop machines.

14,Erica P.,"Seattle, WA",88,184,994.0,1.0,2015-11-21,"Utterly disappointing. Came in at 1:30 for a birthday family birthday lunch at the request of the lovely birthday girl. Right off the bat, service was slow. It took quite a bit of time before we got our drinks; and when the waiter brought them, he delivered everyone's drink except mine (which was on the tray) and then proceeded to start taking food orders. My husband had to reach over and get my drink off of the serving tray while our server was at the other end of the table. As we were a large party and wanted several separate checks, the waiter made a point to have us order based on the grouping of the checks vs where we sat at the table, to avoid any confusion.  The food took AGES to come out. We did not order anything extraordinary. No special requests or substitutions. 10 adult meals and 2 kids meals. We specifically requested for the kids meals to come out as soon as they were up in the window because our kids eat slow, and also because they were super hungry. We do this almost everywhere we go and we've never had a problem. Today, it was well over 25 minutes between placing our order and receiving the kids meals, despite our server assuring us that he would bring their meals out quickly. 10 minutes after that, the adult meals came out. The manager stopped by to offer a token apology for how long our food was taking telling us thay about 6 parties came in at the same time, and wr just happened to be the last one in, so basically we got the short end of the stick. The food was cold. It was very obvious that our plates had sat in the window for quite some time. My mother in law and I ordered the french onion soup, which came out luke-warm. The cheese on top was so congealed that both of us had to saw through it with a knife. The BLTA croissant was bland, the croissant tasted stale, and the rest of the ingredients were just tasteless. Then came time to settle the bills. Two in our party received a bill which totaled five dollars and some change. When the server brought their receipt back for signature, they had been charged THIRTY SEVEN dollars. The manager again came by to tell them that because we had ""so many"" separate checks there had been a mix up. I call bs on that, because multiple separate checks does not explain how their first receipt was for 5 and change and the one they were presented to sign was over 37. The rest of us hadn't even asked for our checks yet as we were still plowing through our cold food. Once the rest of us got our checks, more drama ensued. Two in our group were using their rewards cards to cash in their free birthday meal. Our server came back and was VERY condescending and argumentative with the birthday folk who were trying to use their rewards.  Overall it just left a bad taste in my mouth. I consistently have terrible experiences at this location, yet we keep coming back, hoping it will be different. Frankly, I'm tired of it, and I'm pretty darn tired of Red Robin.

74,Devin F.,"Fall City, WA",0,2,9.0,4.0,2015-12-24,"Let me start by stating that I never give a place 5 out of 5 stars. Simply because I like to believe that there is always room for improvement in naturally, anything that we do. Have it be making food, eating food, ordering food, anything. Period.  However, my most recent experience with the Red Robin located in Canyon Park was probably the nearest to a 5 star worthy review. If you're not hip to the holiday season, it is Christmas Eve. I work about 2 miles away and my boss was kind enough to want to provide lunch for our department. Knowing that a lot of my coworkers intend to leave early today, we decided that placing a lunch order at 11 AM would be sufficient. Yet it was then that we realized that Red Robin opened at 11 AM. OH NO! End of the world right? Wrong. Like many normal business practices, this facility is already loaded with employees eager to work on Christmas Eve. I called at 10:45 (I can't help my military nature. 15 prior to the 15 prior, hurry up and wait mindset) and was patched through to the Bartender. I informed her that I needed to place a take out order for a total of 17 people. She then had me speak with the main attraction of this review, the Manager , Maddie. Maddie was very friendly, kind, and most importantly, attentive. This was as easy as ordering a pizza from a mobile app. As a prior food service team member, I understand the daily frustrations of the industry. From the complicated orders, to the pressure of reassuring the customer that you will make sure this is done right. I held all the faith in the world in Maddie and her team. About 15 minutes later I had realized that an order was forgotten and it was quickly addressed with little to no hesitation. ""No problem"" seemed to be the words of the day.  What was most helpful was that when it got down to my order..... Man did I panic. I like to think I have a good concept of what I want. But after reading all these orders from my fellow coworkers, I had done it again. I became that indecisive customer. You know the type... I asked Maddie what her favorite was, in hopes of finding something to appease my mind, and stomach. She mentioned that her 12 years with the company, although helpful; only made matters worse. We finally arranged the perfect formula. It was a Guac Burger with mushrooms. The happy medium. I know that her and I see differently on the mushroom topic, but she's ok in my book. I even made the contingency that Maddie would need to hire me part-time if this order was in any way incorrect. With confidence, she agreed. I am sad to say, that I will keep my day job, and my day job only. At this time, I will not have the pleasure of working for Maddie. It was by far, one of the best interactions I have ever had at a restaurant. She made it easy, exciting, and fun.  My co workers had no gripes with their orders and all seemed pleased with the food. The soggy fries are no fault of Red Robin's, but the drive is to blame. It happens. They were at least warm. The only thing I found to be unpleasant was when I went to pick up the food. As I sat at the bar with my coworker awaiting the numerous bags. A blonde female from the restaurant side came over and asked the bartender if the to-go order was going to at least leave a tip. She mentioned that 10 percent should be expected. Many may not have heard this, however; the battle tested, combat ears of this veteran, did. I was quick to announce that she need not worry. I too was in the food industry and have a decent amount of respect for my fellow human. Either way, she would not receive the tip anyway. So it boggles my mind. I joked casually with the bartender about the situation and she was a real good sport about it. Aside from that, it was great. So in short, here is my closing statement about this place....  I would battle a wild bear outside my local McDonalds, caged in the handicap stall, with my hands tied behind my back, with a shake-weight super glued to my forehead as my only weapon for a chance to share a meal over skype - on a dial up connection with the employees of this place.    Thanks again Maddie.

I always order the grilled cheese and specified after my last visit with this joint that I in fact did not need my sandwich cut in 12ths and that I would prefer not to have my sandwich on a child's plastic plate. Somewhere along the lines that request was lost in translation. The sandwich thankfully came out cut in half, but it was on a star wars plate. As a 35 year old woman I will pass on the cheap plates made for kids. My daughter counted her fries, she had 5. I think I had 8. Stacy never offered my daughter a refill on her lemonade and never once came back to find out how our meal was or to see if we wanted more fries. Typically I am a great tipper, as I too have been a server. It took everything I had to tip her 10%. Red Robin, get your stuff together and train your employees better.

We started ordering our food and at first, our server seemed very nice however my friend wanted to try one of the lemonades and the server made it sound like she'd just get a refill of another choice if she ended up not liking the new flavor she was trying.

Secondly, we waited for our food for a good 30-40 minutes and when it came out, it was BARELY warm; my fries were cold that I ended not even eating them.

Also can't beat bottomless fries, if that's a thing for you. Where Red Robin locations either excel or fall short is on the service experience, and this location in Bothell is all over the map on service. We've experienced some pretty amazing service now and then, but more often, the experience is just MEH. Middle-of-the-road at best, but often bordering on indifferent. Our most recent experience was on the lower end of the scale. We were seated for about ten minutes before our server appeared--seemed like our table wasn't in his actual section, but he'd been assigned to us maybe because the restaurant was slower that day and they were doing a round-robin type of thing on assigning servers to tables instead of seating people in each server's section. When our server did stop by, the initial experience was fine, with the usual ordering of drinks and food, but that's where things slipped fully into MEH mode. We saw our server just twice more after that, when he stopped by to check on drink refills and clear plates and later to drop off our check. He was phased shortly after that and didn't bother to stop at our table to tell us he was leaving and/or if anyone else would be checking on us. It was purely chance that I saw him leave the restaurant so I knew he was done for the day. The restaurant itself is generally clean, but if you look closely at the ledges beneath the shutters they use to divide the entry space from the dining room, you'll see a layer of dust that indicates some surfaces may not have seen a cleaning (or even a quick wiping down) in at least many days and possibly weeks or months. We've never had a problem with food quality here, and the service issues haven't required a direct discussion with management, nor have they affected our tipping. But we never come to this location with an expectation of an all-around excellent experience, it's typically a pretty functional visit to have a meal because we're hungry and Red Robin sounded good or was convenient for us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bothell,3.08,2.93,2.93,,2.99

However, in this particular location, the staff just doesn't seem interested in making your visit memorable, it seems like they just want to get through their shift. It's not particularly fast service, the bottomless fries come with just a dozen fries each time. I suppose that's prudent on their part (money-saving), but it comes across as cheap. Maybe the first serving could be larger, then scale back on the serving size. Also, when travelling with the little kids, always deliver their food first, no matter if the rest of the table's order is complete, or at least ask if that's what the adults prefer. The restroom was not clean, and I hate that there was only a single soap dispenser on the wall for both sinks.

Then the manager proceeded to the table behind us and profusely apologized for the slowness and gave them a discount, but we were not treated the same. Our server was friendly and have nothing against her. I feel bad for the table of 20 that came in as we were leaving.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bothell,2.48,2.74,2.74,,2.636
