Not just because it's closer to me (I mean I live in Bowie so this one is less than 5 mins away vs. 20 mins lol). Our server the first time my friend and I came was pretty dry, I mean not nice or mean. Second time however, our waiter was super friendly and pretty quick. I will say our food took a long time to come out for a Tuesday night. However when it did get there our burgers were perfect. My friend said there was less sauce on his burger than previous times but still delish. Overall its a pretty good spot for good old American food. You will have to wait long at times but its worth it because your food will usually b perfect, plus bottomless friends, who can resist?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bowie?start=120,2.7,2.7,2.7,2.7,2.7

I went on a Sunday afternoon for lunch which was a bad idea as I was almost run down by at least 2 five year olds just running around with no parent in sight. We were seating really quickly (I assume since we werent a family of 9) and our waiter seemed attentive at first. After awhile he had to be flagged down for things and never in my limited visits to red robin have I had to ask for more fries, since they are ""bottomless"" that usually bring an extra basket to the table. overall I would re visit the place, just not on ""family"" day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bowie?start=100,2.7640000000000002,2.7640000000000002,2.7640000000000002,2.7640000000000002,2.7640000000000002
130,Denise N.,"Bowie, MD",26,70,7.0,5.0,2012-02-19,"Despite the fact that this place does have a bar tucked in the corner and openly advertises their happy hour, this restaurant is winner when it comes to taking the family out to eat. They have great kids menu that is far from overpriced. Let's just say, you can sit down and eat for the same price you pay for that cardboard box at the drive-thru window. Adults can be satisfied here as well with the large selection of burger and chicken sandwich offerings not too mention you can substitute all selections with a turkey burger or black bean patty for the healthier options. Kids young and old (that means us adults too) can feel playful when odering one of their specialty option beverages such as strawberry spreckle lemonade. By the way, all drinks are bottomless, not just the fountain drinks. Red Robins are popping up here and there near local mall areas near you.

79,Passion C.,"District Heights, MD",280,192,83.0,3.0,2012-02-20,"Um. I have mixed feelings about this place. The burgers are good. I had the one with egg on it.  But the fries sucked. So it seems like onion rings are a better option but I didn't get a chance to tell my waiter that I wanted onion rings instead of fries because he barely came over to our table. And the service seems okay as long as you don't have the last server that we had. He completely forgot to put our appetizer in at all. And didn't seem to take his job as a server very serious. But he did suggests a good drink for me. So I guess that makes it a restaurant floating somewhere in the middle of restaurant mediocrity. I would probably go there again if I'm in the mood for a creative burger. But since I don't eat burgers very much, I'm sure that won't be until some time next year. It seems like a good choice for a group of friends that aren't really trying to spend a lot of money.

109,Kathy M.,"Washington, DC",38,104,,3.0,2012-05-29,"Not sure what all the fuss is about but this is a basic burger joint people, let's all just calm down (smile).  Yes, they have won awards and garnered attention about their delicious food, but chile, please.  There's nothing uniquely special about Red Robbins.  The food isn't bad, but it's not worth a special trip.  If you're already in the vicinity and in the mood for a burger, then it may be worth your while.  Especially since two people can dine for less than $30.  I had the ""scroom burger"" which is their burger with grilled mushrooms and it was good, but not exceptional.  Their french fries are *delicious* and if you like thick, steak fries seasoned with old bay, you'll be in heaven.  The burger, accompanied by the fries gives this place a solid, well deserved, 3 star rating.  For dessert, I had their brownie lava cake but if you're a chocolate lover, I suggest you skip this dish, lest you be sorely disappointed.  It didn't quite have the rich, smooth, chocolate taste one would expect from a chocolate lava brownie.  Although the strawberries surrounding this dish are a nice touch, they are from a jar and not fresh - it was more of a weak attempt to please.  You may want to try their version of a mud pie which (judging from the pic) looks promising.  I believe there's also an apple dish as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bowie?start=100,2.7,2.7,2.7,2.7,2.7
104,Tom I.,"Bowie, MD",4,41,11.0,2.0,2012-06-16,"Walking by the windows looking in - we see a bunch of empty tables ""Great - no wait"" I think.  WRONG!   Enter the restaurant and are sort of greeted by the hostesses - all four of them - seemed as if they were doing us a favor by adding our names to the seating list.  Didn't even ask my name-just stared at me while shaking the tablet device as if to imply I should know what to do.  Sometimes I can take a hint - so I give my name and the girl says ""15-20 minutes"" turns and continues her conversation with the others.   Oh well- so much for not having to wait...sit and wait for a table. I look around and see a number of tables waiting to be cleaned and the notice the floors are a bit sticky.  I think to myself - given the amount of dirty tables and sticky floor one would think out of four hostesses two of whom I would think could lend a hand, pick up a rag and at least wipe tables.   Then I see why the tables and floors look like they do - only one bus boy and he's listening to his iPod (clearly not an in-house earpiece as the guy was bopping his head to the beats he was listening to) and wearing pants way to low - in the all too popular show the underwear style.   Get seated in about 15mins - Great!   Danny - our server was great!  Friendly - welcoming - just seemed like a great guy.   Place an order for the three-for-all fries (steak fries, onion straws, and sweet tater fries).  Fries were good - onion straws a bit greasy - but overall decent. Burgers and salads arrive - pretty decent, but not unlike anything I make at home.   The restaurant is definitely not a quiet place.  Kids screaming and their parents trying to have a conversation speak louder than the screaming kids.  Obviously not Red Robin's fault - but I guess could try and seperate the families from the couples(?).   Also I am not a fan of the overly loud birthday chants - I realize some people seek that attention - and I am happy you're out spending money helping the economy but there has to be a way to find a balance between screaming and clapping for birthday diners (3 within a half hour? - really?).  Not sure of the solution - maybe do once per hour and include all of those celebrating??  To me - if that means to find a quiet dinner somewhere else - so be it.

103,Francesca R.,"Takoma Park, MD",30,51,29.0,3.0,2012-07-02,"Having lost power, and thereby all the food in the fridge, my husband and I decided that the best thing to do would be to find a restaurant with power and have ourselves an enjoyable meal.  I was craving burgers, and he'd never been to a Red Robin before.  Pulling up their website, the first thing we see is the featured ""FIREY GHOST"" burger, and upon seeing it has GHOST PEPPERS in the description, my spicy-hotstuff-loving husband was sold!  (If you read my review of Jewel of India on 2/17, you may remember he very much enjoyed a ""kill you spicy"" chicken vindaloo.) Getting there was an adventure, with all the downed trees, detours and intersections without power to the traffic lights, the 15-minute drive to Bowie ended up taking us closer to 45 minutes.  However, our efforts were rewarded as we drove into the busy shopping center to discover that yes, indeed, they had power.  The restaurant itself was on about a 25-minute wait, which wasn't surprising.  We meandered on over to the bar to have ourselves a beer while we waited.  Bar: The employee behind the bar took our order, but was evidently too young to pour for us and had to wait for another young person (I guess he was 18 or 19).  She told him what we ordered - she got it right, he didn't.  After correcting his callback twice, he at least gave us the right BEER but the wrong size. He did charge us correctly, though, so I guess that wasn't so bad. Service:  When we finally got seated, it was a bit of a wait before our waiter greeted us.  We were never given water (I eventually asked a floor manager for a glass), we had to ask three times for a particular condiment (my husband wanted an extra side of the ghost pepper ketchup for his fries), and our burgers arrived about five minutes after our appetizers - VERY poorly timed! We had barely time for our appetizers to cool enough to eat before the burgers were in front of us! (I don't know about you, but I happen to like at least a LITTLE bit of time between courses. If we go back I suppose we will have to order our burgers after our appetizers arrive.)  On the positive side, our server was friendly, and I would imagine perhaps a bit overwhelmed by the volume (I have no idea how many people in the surrounding community were without power).   Food: My husband very much liked his burger.  He felt it was spicy enough (he expected less spicy as he is often disappointed by the lack of heat and flavor in ""spicy"" food at chain restaurants), and our appetizers were very good.  The oil in the fryer must have been clean, because our appetizers (onion rings and fried mushrooms) were not overly saturated with grease and the breading was a nice light color.   I ordered the Prime Chophouse, which I felt had too high a ratio of bread to burger.  However, once I took off the top bun (cut it in half and folded it over) the flavors came out more I rather enjoyed it. The Dijon was nice and zesty.  I wouldn't say the burger itself is anything special, and I've been to places with some amazing burgers that are wonderful without any sort of added toppings.  What Red Robin has going for it is that they have a wide variety of very tasty flavor combinations. Then again, I guess they have to, since the burger patty itself really isn't all that interesting, nor is it large enough. Rating: I would give this place a two-star rating, but since my husband was so impressed with the ghost pepper burger I am going to give it a 3 (really more of a 2.5, but yelp doesn't allow that).  Thanks for reading. =)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bowie?start=100,2.604,2.604,2.604,2.604,2.604

You have to try the Onion Ring Tower if you never have.  By far, their best app. We dined there last night and the service was not our usual.  Our appetizer came out with our meal.  We didn't wait long for it to be served which was nice, but what's the point of the appetizer if it comes out with your dinner? Secondly, at the end of our meal, our waitress did not clear our plates.  THIS IS A PET PEEVE for me.  I used to wait tables and this is a MUST.  PRE BUS people!  If you want me to order dessert, clear my damn food.  I even stacked plates and bowls for her and set them on the edge to try and get the point across.

66,Elsa M.,"Baltimore, MD",4427,859,2250.0,3.0,2012-08-28,"Haha!  Red Robin is a club?!  Ok - well, maybe it's not a club, but it felt like one Friday night.  The hubs and I went to a movie and wanted to grab a low-key late night nibble nearby.  Red Robin glowed bright in its bold red hue, so we made the trip there. I have never seen so many happy teens chompin' on burgers in my laugh. LOL!  The odd thing is, there was a table of elderly women getting loud right next to them and a family of all ages at a long table in the back.  It was almost 11 at night, so the combo of kids from 2 to 18 coupled with adults up to 89ish both amazed and impressed me.   Why do I bring this up?  Because it speaks to Red Robin's appeal.  If you can get these demos in one spot on a Friday night, then I would say whatever you are doing marketing-wise is working.  To be honest, I just wanted to go here because you can get drinks with your burgers (something tells me the grandmas were there for the same reason), but I forgot all about the shakes and desserts, which must have attracted the kiddies. So, what about the food? Solid.  The burgers are fab, but the salads are weak if you are trying to go light.  Honestly, I haven't strayed too much for anything else on the menu.  Seems it's a ""go big or go home"" type place for me.  Fries are good, but not the best.  3-stars for being a family friendly restaurant with alcohol - a winning combo if you ask me! lol! P.S.  I don't know who does the training here, but the serving staff is johnny on the spot with making sure you are taken care of - even late night.  In fact, they can be a little too much so (i.e. stopping by the table every 30 seconds), but I would rather have that than be ignored.  Hats off to the staff!  They have a good time, but they get the work done and are very pleasant!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bowie?start=60,2.572,2.572,2.572,2.572,2.5720000000000005

Our waiter (I don't remember his name...I swear I'll do better with this) was cordial.  I ordered tenders, fries and a side salad. Oh, and a frozen Ultimate Margarita. The margarita wasn't super tasty..it was actually a bit sour but I drank it anyway. I had to ask to have my salad come out before the rest of my meal. WHEN did this become common practice?! I thought the salad was supposed to come BEFORE the meal and not WITH it. Anyhow, When he did bring it, I needed extra Ranch (that I never got) and oil & vinegar (that I didn't get until after I'd already eaten my salad). I've never worked in the food service industry and I've never been a waitress but I imagine that it doesn't take much to get a small cup of salad dressing.

YES the service is great, the food is awesome, and I love the atmosphere. I do not  eat at most sit-down restaurants and Red Robin has kept me interested. It is always delicious and they are always updating their menu. I was going to Red Robin in Annapolis before this one was built and BOY WAS I EXCITED THAT IT WAS COMING TO BOWIE! ...but recently...I ran into a problem...the bottomless fries. SO recently the portion size for the fries have been a little small and the buzzard wings ALSO shrank in size. VERY disappointing because they are pricy but they were delicious and satisfying. They used to be worth the money, but now I don't even bother with Red's appetizers anymore because of it. So the big issue: My family and I ordered fries after our meal. 3 of us wanted one extra serving of fries, but the waitress said that they could only give us ONE....and it was SMALL. Maybe 6 fries in it. EVEN IF THEY GAVE US 6 EACH I WOULD'NT BE THAT UPSET. RED ROBIN.. DO NOT ADVERTISE BOTTOMLESS FRIES IF EACH PERSON CANNOT ORDER EVEN ONE EXTRA! I understand how there may be complications to getting fries to everyone all of the time, but my issue is....JUST DON'T advertise it if it cannot be done. My milkshake didn't even come with a refill cup..which I should have gotten....as stated in the menu! I really don't appreciate this! This has me bothered because I never had this issue at the Annapolis location...or Bowie's before that night!..and the food used to come with more fries so I never HAD to ask for more!

At other times, the service is TERRIBLE (and I mean terrible..) and the food comes out cold, parts of the order are missing, the server ignores you or takes forever to come take your order. The past few times I have been here have fallen into the ""terrible"" category. I came by myself for lunch one day, and the server took everyone else's order except mine. He basically just ignored me, until I frantically waved at him and demanded that he come over. He then acted like I was bothering him the rest of the time. I never do this, but I didn't leave a tip. I had never experienced rudeness like that before. The next time, my husband and I came for dinner and we sat in the bar area to avoid a long wait. We were given menus right away, but then the server took FOREVER to take our orders. Then, we waited over 30 minutes for our food (all we ordered was a veggie burger and regular burger). When it finally came, the order was messed up, and the server just gave me a blank look and said ""sorry""... Her response was really weird.

My fiance and I get there on a Saturday night.  There's a long wait and we opted to dine in the bar instead. It took more than 15 minutes before a waitress came to our table.  There were waitresses walking past us and serving others even those who arrived after us.  The bartender, when caught up on orders, would help customers but ignored our table. When the waitress came, she asked if anyone helped us and we replied no.  Then, she said, ""do you want me to help you?""   No, we're just sitting down and people-watching.  Of course, we'd like to be helped with our orders. We ordered our drinks and placed our orders and then asked for a basket of fries. The waitress was not to be seen again.  More than 15 minutes passed and still no drinks or fries.  I spied her serving a table in the general dining area.  Instead of gathering all the orders for all parties at the table, she'd go and get something and bring it to one person.  Then, turn to the other person at the same table.  She'd go and retrieve.  Then, she asked a kid at the same table and went off for some items.  She can't multi-task.   There were people at the table next to us who had been there before us.  They were also waiting for the waitress as well.  We kept looking at each other in shock. The manager had to come out and bring out drinks as they were left untouched at the bar.  When the manager brought out drinks, we informed him of the lousy service.  He just simply shrugged his shoulders and mumbled a sorry.  (He did remove my alcoholic drink from the bill.) Another waitress brought out food.  I had the Clucks and Shrimp.  It was pretty good.  However, the bad service really distracted us from enjoying our meal. The waitress finally arrived at our table when we were mid-way finished with our meal.  She was like, ""I'm so sorry"".   Yeah, yeah, you're not doing a good job.  We asked for a refill.  Good Lord!  It took a good 10 minute wait.  When she arrived, we asked for the check because God knows when we'd see her again.   Anyways, the point is that the staff at this Red Robin need to be retrained because service was just unacceptable.  There's no way I'd return to this location!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bowie?start=20,2.84,2.84,2.84,2.02,2.84

76,Bill G.,"Alexandria, VA",48,19,13.0,2.0,2015-01-10,"When I was in college I worked at Red Robin so I have a strong affection for the brand. As a CDT (Certified Dedicated Trainer) and also bar manager I understand how their process is supposed to work. I also understand the variables that occur and how demanding working in the restaurant business can be. On multiple occasions I've left the Bowie location with issues and just last month my wife and I agreed we were never returning. Today I gave in and told her I'd pick dinner up and bring it home. I called to place my order four times and the phone rang without answer each time after selecting the carry out option. I was 20 minutes away so our food should've been ready when I arrived instead I took a seat at the bar with my debit card in hand only to be ignored for 15 minutes with 3 bartenders on duty and only 3 other people seated by me.  I've given them multiple chance before posting a lackluster review. Partly because of brand loyalty but also because this location hasn't been here for too long and I was chalking up my dissatisfaction to growing pains and the learning curve, trusting management knew their issues and would correct their shortcomings. The last time we ate in it was 10 minutes before we were greeted, another 5 to get our sodas, and another 10 to place our order only to have my burger delivered to the table next to us, the lady pick it up,  place it back in the basket, say that wasn't what she ordered, and then have it placed in front of me. Five minutes later my wife's salad came missing the bread and the waitress returned with 4 pieces of bread on a plate, stuck the plate in my wife's face and said ""here take one."" My wife refused to touch the plate and then have the other 3 pieces served other people and requested her bread be delivered on a separated plate. We never got it.  This trip was in early December in the middle of flu season and the lady that touched my burger was coughing into her hand throughout dinner. Pretty gross and a violation of health code on multiple levels. Not her coughing but she touched my dinner and if it wasn't hers it should've been trashed. We took my burger to go and fed it to our dog. She didn't get sick but I wasn't risking it myself. I had a couple fries. The bill was delivered, 10 minutes to swipe my card and no pen was delivered with our print out. Luckily my wife had one and we escaped in slightly over an hour but I was still hungry. Not to good for a chain that has a two minute greet policy and eight minute cook times. Even if you chewed every bight 26 times and had desert you should never ever be at a Red Robin for more than 30-40 minutes max. We were one of 4 tables seated on a Sunday night and there's no excuses for how bad they were, it was ridiculous.  The two stars are split one for the food and the other for the building. The food is good and the taste, quality, and consistency are what I expect from Red Robin. The kitchen isn't the problem here. I believe the server calls for the warm bread to be put on the salad so the lettuce stays cold. Salads obviously quicker than burgers to prepare but it was delivered late and incomplete. This would be a server issue and service here is definitely the biggest hurdle they have to overcome. What they call ""Table Visits"" were required by management back when I was there. It was important for management to check in and get feedback with the clients and I can say in all of our trips we've never once had a manager come and ask us how everything was. Maybe starting this would fix their deficiencies and since we've never been visited and we do care, Yelp seems to be the best way to provide our feedback. Again this store isn't terribly old maybe a few years now and it was previously very open and very noisy. They've already remodeled installing glass partitions between the sections and changed the lighting so the second star is for some of the location issues being addressed and corrected. Hopefully this review reaches someone with the ability to bring Bowie back up to cooperate standards and if so and by the small chance we do ever go back I'd be more than happy to revise my review. I didn't want to in the first place but whether dining in or taking it to go they've made it very difficult to eat there. It's worse now the when it was brand new, I hadn't eaten at Red Robin in years and we were excited for the opening only to be let down over and over again.

But maybe you all should add produce that actually grows in a garden to this burger he made us pay for half the price of the burger... Which I was upset about because I took only 2 bites ... (First bite because that's what you do when you get your food ... Second bite to reconfirm that it was as disgusting as the first bite) he offered something to go but I refused I didn't need to taste anymore of their disgusting food... Idk how they are still open the quality of food is well there is no quality ... five guys burgers are way better .. Also Copper Canyon has an epic veggie burger that guess what contains veggies ....

Normally the food and service are both of decent quality. However, my recent visit (Sunday April 12) was horrible. My wife and I were seated in a reasonable amount of time, and the server (Xavier) was quick to our table for our drink and food order, and that is about where the good part of the experience ends. A runner did bring our food in a slightly longer than average time, and that was the only time during the meal that anyone from Red Robin stopped by our table. No server, manager, or runner (other than food delivery) came by in the 40 minutes or so between ordering and getting the bill. This means: No Flatware provided - we had to get the hostess to get us some. Empty condiment containers on table - had to grab someone as they passed to get them replaced. No checking if the order was correct and if the food was satisfactory. No offers to refill fries - which considering I got the few from the bottom of the heat pan with all the crumbs and salt - would have been nice. No refills on drinks despite empty glasses on the edge of the table for 15 minutes. When the server finally came by again, it was with bill in hand, and asking ""if we were ready to close out"". It certainly was not a meal that left a positive impression, and may keep me from going back to the Bowie Location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bowie?start=20,2.32,2.32,2.32,2.12,2.32

Although it's only Thursday afternoon, I have to admit I was extremely surprised by how few people were in Red Robin.  As you can see from the picture attached to this review, there were not that many customers in the restaurant. So you can imagine our surprise when it took almost 10 minutes to get two glasses of water with lemon. Now granted they did come out with our drinks from the bar, but again a glass of wine and a real quick cocktail should not have taken 10 minutes. My husband and I ordered three appetizers and two burgers. After 22 minutes of waiting for the appetizers themselves to come out, not even the burgers mind you just the appetizers, we called the restaurant manager over to our table. We insisted to only pay for drinks that way we could leave. If it was taking 22 minutes to get appetizers, we could only imagine how long it would take to get our burgers.  Irony of ironies, right as we were explaining our displeasure to the manager our burgers came out. I did not say appetizers - I said our main meals. We explained how unacceptable it was not only to have to wait this long, but the fact that our main entrees to come out before the appetizers is just ludicrous. The manager said he would take the appetizers off of our bill but we can still have them for free if we wanted to. We said okay we would take him for free, and then somehow someway the appetizers magically appeared on our table less than a minute later. But wait, it gets better. Most of the way through our meal we discovered a hair in our queso. I attached a picture of it here for you to judge what it the hair look like. What type of hair does it look like to you? If it's not a pubic hair, then maybe it's a hair from someone's beard. This brings into question if members of the kitchen crew are wearing beard guards, as restaurant safety regulations require. We were disgusted and left the premises as soon as we paid for our drinks. We will never go back there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bowie?start=20,2.4,2.4,2.4,1.988,2.4

We proceed to place our order and she was nice about answering our questions about the menu. Now that our order is place, we're just observing how no one is cleaning up the place. When our food arrives, our order was not brought out as ordered. Which wasn't a big problem at first. Until we found out we didn't have any silverware or napkins. Wow! That should be the first thing on the table. Maybe it's just me. Our waiter came back and asked was everything okay. We mention that we did not have silverware and needed some extra item. She said okay and proceed to go take two more tables orders before grabbing utensils so we can enjoy our food while it's hot. No one likes cold food. So minutes went by and the manager came by, which was just walking around looking at these dirty tables. So, we finally stopped him and told him about our experience thus far. His word out of his mouth was, "" Sorry to hear about the utensils, I would go grab that for you. Would you like for me to warm up your burger for you?"" No sir but the silverware would be nice. After ten mins of waiting on something to eat with and you just want to re-warm my burger. I could totally understand if the place was busy or Understaff but this was not the case. I'm a frequent customer to Red Robin but not this particular one but if this was my first experience, it would definitely be my last.

Now, I don't know the restaurant business but I recall hearing that tables are often left open due to a server not being able to take care of that area. All I'm saying is, if that's the case, then those serving you should do that in a timely manner. Our waitress was very pleasant and nice; however, she did end up getting a party of 30 right after putting out order in. If that's the case, give the poor girl help or dedicate one server to that party. She dealt with that party and our table; however, due to the size, neglected us. And what's the point of the machine at the table to ""call server"" when they don't come??  The gist, service sucked.  Food wise, not that great either. The burger wasn't good, well, it was okay.

The service was good, I cannot fault that.  The server we had was pretty attentive (only had one instance where I felt like we hadn't seen him in a while).  When he was present, he was friendly and helpful.  Maybe the servers should write orders down more, though, because we had a couple of miscues with our party. First, my salsa was missing (more on that later).  Second, one of the kids' meals was supposed to have apples, and it came with oranges instead.  Not the end of the world, but still worth noting. About the salsa... a buck for a small plastic ramekin of mediocre salsa?  Really?  THAT cost a dollar?  Yeah, I don't think so. I ordered the Wedgie burger to try something different.  There is no bun, but two big chunks of iceberg lettuce.  It was only so-so.  The lettuce was the predominant flavor, there wasn't nearly enough guacamole on it, the onions were entirely too plentiful and overwhelming, and the burgers have an off flavor.  I can't describe it, but if I had to, it tastes like the grill, like a gas grill. I swapped out the fries for the freckled fruit salad, which was okay, but the fruit was macerated.  It still tasted fine, but it might not be the texture that patrons are expecting. The poutine starter was pretty good, I will say that.  The cheese curds were fried, but that didn't detract from the overall dish.  Not 100% authentic because of it, but who's checking?  The taste was spot on. Overall, just okay.  I liked the app and bottomless root beer float, but the burger (what you're supposed to be going there for) is probably the last burger on my list of preferred options.  Bottomless sides and drinks do not compensate for a less-than-middle-of-the-road main entrée.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-bowie,2.48,2.54,2.54,,2.516

However, the management did come over and help everything get fixed.  They also made sure to check on us and make sure things were getting better. Food:  Red Robin is known for their burgers, so I always come here to get a unique burger.  I ordered the southern charm and my mom ordered the black and bleu.  My burger (once corrected) was great.  I also get extra onion straws on the side to add to my burger.  My mom also enjoyed her black and bleu burger (she loves bleu cheese).  The garlic parm fries are GREAT and I loved them.  They were perfectly flavored.

Here goes: We came in an hour before closing on Saturday night (closes 11pm).  We sat at the bar and placed our orders. We got our drinks fast. Thats good. The bar seemed like a mess though. The bartender was busy cleaning and shutting down machines. Trash was being emptied. It just seemed like they were more concerned with cleaning and getting out. I felt like I was in their way.  When the food arrived the bartender dropped the plates on the counter for us. My date asked me why the bartender slammed the food on the counter. He did kinda just dropped the plates instead of placing it nicely.  How would you feel if someone aggressively served your plate? Makes it feel cheap. Which brings me to the food quality.  It felt like mcdonalds. Maybe that is an insult to mcdonalds. Honestly. Was Red Robins always like this?  I had fond memories of the restaurant. I guess i never been to this area.
