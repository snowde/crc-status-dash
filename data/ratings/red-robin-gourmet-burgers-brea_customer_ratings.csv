171,Melissa G.,"Monterey Park, CA",139,268,209.0,4.0,2012-03-15,Standard Red Robin... which is actually a quite fantastic thing! Excellent service for our party of 10. Food came quickly and the server was already prepared with a fifty million sauces AND two extra baskets of bottomless fries. Ordered my usual Sauteed Shroom Burger with a little bit of pink. It was perfect! Tips I've learned from a Red Robin master: -Always ask for the fries to come out right after you order -Ask them to cut your burger in half -Make sure you try the Campfire sauce (this magical mixture is believed to be part Mayo part BBQ sauce) What else can I say? I love it!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brea?start=160,3.92,3.92,3.92,3.536,3.92

156,Marsella K.,"Gilbert, AZ",361,202,53.0,2.0,2012-08-12,"I generally like Red Robin.  No, it's not exactly gourmet or memorable, but it's a consistent, family-friendly place that I can take my kid to without much fuss.  And then I visited the Brea Mall location last week... From the first moment she approached our table, I could tell our server would have rather been anywhere else, like the DMV or the dentists' chair.  She was extremely curt, spoke quickly, and sounded like she was reading from a script.  No smile, no warmth, no.... anything.  Our food was dropped off by someone else, who smiled.  That was nice. Shortly after the food was brought out, our check was dropped off by Ms. Personality while we were still eating.  Too bad my son had asked for ice cream after dinner; I had to run by 7-11 for a Dove Bar on the way home.  So, I was only able to glance at the server's name on the check... Alessa, Alessia, Alyssa... something like that.  I really hope it was just a very bad day for her, or hope she graduates soon and finds a career she's happy about. As for the food, my Burnin Love burger (sub grilled chicken) probably would've been a lot better if it wasn't topped with ICE COLD breaded & fried jalapenos.  Seriously, after the first two bites I was like WTF - what is so dang cold on my burger?  I pulled it apart and quickly found the breaded, soggy, recently thawed jalapenos.  NOT NICE!  And my burger patty wasn't exactly hot either.  My son's pizza was all doughy and white, too.  It was like pepperoni & cheese on top of half-baked Pillsbury refrigerated pizza crust in the can.  He usually eats 3 - 4 pieces of a large Dominos pizza but ate less than half of this small kids portion. Why am I even giving two stars?  Hmmm... I'm not sure.  I guess because I had a nice time visiting with my cousin's lovely wife and their gorgeous chubby baby!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brea?start=140,3.96,3.96,3.96,3.0480000000000005,3.96

Pus, Red Robin has bottomless drinks & fries (the freckled strawberry lemonade is amazing) that will make it worth while. Not a fan of the seasoning, but the sauces they have are to die for!

The server during our was almost no where to be seen for almost 20-25 minutes at a time and never checked to see how our food was. Entrees: Royal Red Robin burger - cooked to my liking. Hot and crispy fries Guacamole bacon burger - over cooked. Fries like they were left out in the cold after its been cooked the first time then fried again. Plus drinks. Bill came out to $35. Overall not a bad deal. Only reason why I am giving them one star is because I over heard the manager tell guests at another table that all the proteins that are on the menu for example - chicken, hamburger, turkey patty, etc.  Is cooked on a conveyor belt oven.

It had mushrooms, provolone cheese, onion straws, and 2 different types of sauces. I usually find myself getting a spicy kind of burger like the Burnin Love, but I'd get this burger again. Ask for Well Done Fries if you like them crunchy and dip them in the sweet & spicy ketchup or their campfire sauce! Chili Chili Burger ($10): you really have to eat this burger with a fork and knife. For $2 more you can get chili cheese fries, but my BF decided not to do that. It had chili, red onions, black beans, cheddar cheese, and diced tomatoes. I didn't think anything special of it when I had a bite of it and my BF agreed that the Prime Chophouse burger was much better. Service: Andrew was great!

165,Hanz W.,"Yorba Linda, CA",204,231,81.0,4.0,2013-05-27,"Guacamole Bacon Burger came out unexpectedly peRfecto! at first I wasn't pleased at the design of not actually wrapping the burger in lettuce, instead its a stack of lettuce on top and bottom to literally replace the bun.  As usual, lettuce wrapped burgers usually end up extra tall (d/t the amount of lettuce they use as the 'bun') and then my mouth can't open big enough to get a complete bite.  So here at RR, they made it sooo tall that my mouth cleared from the bottom to like just below the guac/toplayer...gawd this is gonna be messy. It was so deliciously balanced.  I might be dreaming but theres a salsa-y touch under the guac creaminess combined with the crispy lettuce and the savory beef.  Its too good. Love it. The water on the other hand....tasted as bad as a bathroom smells.  Its a great incentive to buy a soda or something.  I even had two lemons in there to mask the metallic taste that usually comes with restaurant water, did not help at all. Waitress was ok, seemed nice but I think she was spread out cuz she rarely came by to check on our table.  We did get refills in a timely manner but she didn't offer any condiments with our fries, plus didn't refill our fries till after she brought out the check like she wanted us to close out the check...i guess we looked like we were done.  We ignored the check standing on our table edge since at that time we werent done, we did want more fries.  She actually asked if we wanted to settle the check when she came around and we hadn't touched it.  Maybe she's in a hurry to close it?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brea?start=160,3.8,3.8,3.8,3.184,3.8
153,Brandon M.,"Fullerton, CA",24,153,7.0,5.0,2013-06-13,"5 stars is what Red Robin in Brea deserves as that is truly as good as it gets! I have yet to visit this location and experience anything but perfect food and service. I have been a customer for YEARS, and plan on continuing... There is something about this location that attracts me to it. I've been to Red Robins throughout OC/LA, and none can compare... To start, the first thing you take note of with any restaurant is parking and then the environment once going in. Parking can be a hit and miss since this location is at the Brea Mall. But since I ride a sport motorcycle, I always park on the sidewalk next to the door (assuming security doesn't get at me over it - which they haven't so far). The environment is always clean, family oriented, and as it should be. They have plenty of TV's, which is a big plus for me during the NFL season. Next would come the customer service. They always have someone at the front desk to greet you and reserve your seating. When they give time estimates for your wait (assuming there is a wait), they are almost 100% accurate (sometimes a table frees up sooner then expected). Once seated, the waiters are usually on it - offering some of the best service out there. To finish it up, the food is amazing. The menu offers great variety for any eater. Naturally, I love the burgers that come with endless fries - you can never go wrong with that. And you cant go wrong with their milk shakes, if you are out for a nice treat. To top everything off, the prices aren't half bad compared to their competitors. Having the red royalty card (giving you a free burger after buying 9 and a free burger for your birthday) is always pleasant as well.. In all, this red robin is a great spot to eat.

However, I've always come to this RR with a big group (10+ people) and they've always been more than accommodating. They split our checks and run a dozen cards with  no problem. So their service deserves 5 stars.  The thing that gets me here is their general neglect for cleanliness. Everytime I've come, the tables and menus are always sticky and have remnants of diners past.

Apparently, Red Robin changed their provider for the birthday program a few months ago, but we still got the emails this last week and arranged for a sitter today so we could go. We were very up front and gave the certificates to the server as we ordered. We ordered drinks, and shortly after they arrived, the manager came to our table and informed us that our certificates were from the old program and no longer valid, even though we had just received the certificates from their former business partner. I asked where that left us, and he said that we would be pay full price for our meal. I told him that in that case, we were leaving, and her told our server to charge us for the drinks that we had barely even sipped.  No heated exchange, just a complete lack of customer service. Not our fault that their business partner sent out birthday certificates. We have enjoyed Red Robin for years, but will never go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brea?start=160,3.64,3.64,3.64,2.5320000000000005,3.6400000000000006

117,Pamela M.,"Brea, CA",459,304,1025.0,4.0,2013-12-07,"I come to this location all the time because 1) my mom is a big fan of Red Robin and 2) it is conveniently located inside the Brea Mall. The mall itself has a big food court with lots of selections, but sometimes its just nice to have a nice, sit down meal while shopping. The food here is really good. I am a fan of Red Robin and their 'gourmet' burgers. Most importantly, I am a huuuuuge fan of their sides. Bottomless steak fries, sweet potato fries, and garlic fries are where its at. Their onion rings are really good too (especially with the sauce they serve it with) but unfortunately, those are not bottomless. Womp womp. I always get the turkey burger from Red Robin because it is very tasty, juicy and delicious. The sauce they put on it is so good. The service here has been hit-or-miss for me. It's either amazing service or completely lacking. I came here a week and a half ago and had a waitress who was M.I.A. 90% of the time I was there. I never got refills for fries or drinks, or got anything else I needed at the time. Also, it took literally over 15 minutes to find someone to get our check. I got so tired of waiting, I went up to the hostess desk to ask for our check. However on my most recent visit a few days ago, our waitress was GREAT and she attended to us very well. She checked on us often, but not too often, and offered different sauce suggestions, which I appreciated very much. Our drinks were never empty and she was extremely friendly. I wish I got her name to mention in the review because she really deserves the praise! I hope to get better service here more often than just half of the time I come here, especially because I am a regular here. I love the food and the price isn't too bad either. Their happy hour is only at the bar area (kind of a bummer), but they have booths and tables there, as well as bar stools.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brea?start=120,3.56,3.56,3.56,2.8320000000000003,3.5600000000000005

219,Ryan G.,"Los Angeles, CA",221,3,,1.0,2014-01-12,"My roommate and I decided to go out to eat on a Sunday and had several choices to choose from for dinner. We didn't want nothing too fancy or any fast food. We decided to go to Red Robin, since it was fairly close and we haven't gone to the restaurant out here. We are both from out of town and training out here in Brea for work so choosing where to go should be special. We got to the location and the restaurant was really slow around 715pm. We did not get greeted at the host stand, instead 2 minutes after waiting, we got asked by a server walking by initially ignoring the host stand, if ""we even helped yet"". (You would think 2 men standing at the host stand we're not looking at architecture in the restaurant for all sakes, of course we need to be HELPED!) Finally after 3 minutes a random waitress that didn't ask if we needed help initially sat us. The entire restaurant was empty, but of course she decides to put 2 grown men in the only section packed full with 2 tables full of small infants; nothing against infants but there was no room for us to sit nor able to enjoy with crying babies surrounding us. I asked to be seated in a booth and luckily we got that request fulfilled. Literally 10 seconds after we sat in the booth we were asked by our waitress Yvonne if we were ready to order ( while she is asking this, she looked panicked and worried about getting more tables sat rather than any personal service to us). She then realized we just sat and asked if we wanted to start with any alcoholic beverages or lemonade. We both ordered a water and immediately the expression on her face turned bitter in disgust because she was probably having the perception we were cheap and not going to make any money off of us. She brought out the 2 waters and we got to order an appetizer and 2 entrees. The appetizer came out very promptly, but the wait staff seemed uncaring and had a kitchen worker that did not say one word to us when he dropped off our appetizer. This gentleman also brought out our entrees and did not acknowledge or say a word to us too, just literally dropped the food on the table and walked away. While in the process of eating we got near empty with our water glasses. Without even exaggerating, it took 15 minutes for them to be refilled; take in consideration Yvonne stared at our glasses 3 times walking by and did not even acknowledge them. Yvonne did not speak a word to us from the time we ordered our food to until she asked if we wanted dessert. Yvonne seemed like she only wanted tips and upsells to get more money. We finally got our check and when she dropped it off (before we even paid) she said in a hurried manner ""thanks for coming in bye"", while she stared at the table sat next to us with 4 guests probably having dollar signs in her eyes. I even overheard her say to the guests a statement that is horrible to hear in the restaurant business of ""we don't carry that anymore, corporate took that away""; what a total slap in the face of the company! This was probably one of the few times I did not leave a tip and felt alright doing a gesture like this for as bad as our experience was. I work in hospitality also and always tip generously, but Yvonne or Red Robin did not earn my money during this experience . I wish my roommate and I decided on a different place rather than the Red Robin, since it left us feeling like the worst experience of service since being here in California.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brea?start=200,3.36,3.36,3.36,2.5640000000000005,3.3600000000000003

He wanted to remedy the situation and quickly took down my information to send out a gift card, which I received yesterday. He also mentioned that when I go back to visit, and if he's working at that time, that he would personally come and apologize. Wow, I have to say that that really blew me away.

115,Missy R.,"Orange, CA",182,111,111.0,2.0,2014-02-23,"Mediocre time from a mediocre chain. Then again, should there be more to expect?? Red robin has been around my life since the 90s, and it hasn't changed much since. Their burgers deliver steady acceptable food, their locations are typically convenient, but let's be honest...we all go for the endless fries. I will give them props (which is why this location has 2 and not 1 stars) for offering Boca patties that have never tasted frozen.  My friend and I ended up at this location this weekend after the revolving sushi wait list was gargantuan. Plus it was easy to order a meal to go for my friend's boyfriend.  The only comment I have on the food is attributed to a bold attempt to try something new. Red Robin released a menu of alcoholic shakes, now including BEER shakes. One of the options offered a concoction of Guinness, Jameson whiskey, and chocolate ice cream. Whiskey and ice cream are two of my foodie loves so I decided to give it a go. The drink was delivered cold in a tall draft glass. As I dove for that first sip I was met with an odd taste. What was inside my cup tasted of cream and Guinness. That was it. Not sure where the ice cream, whiskey, taste, or sugar went but it was horrid. I ended up drinking half of it just hoping there was a pot of gold on the other side. Rest assured, there was not. Now, I'm not sure if this was the bartender or the recipe. But I care to assume that Red Robin actually tastes ideas before putting them on the menu, Blegh! Other interesting things included a dead fly stuck to the inside of my menu and their ordering system going down right after we got there. Everyone in the restaurant was out of food for a while. The only redeeming factor (again besides the fries) was the staff. They're not real homey but they're always sure to be nice. All I can say about this location is, get it together man! It's experiences like this that leave nothing of higher promise to be thought of for poorly run chain operations.

That girl is sweet, but Connar always has this terrible attitude. She doesn't greet people at all. On all three occasions I had to be the one to initiate the conversation and tell her how many were in the party. One time I also asked how long the way would be, she told me, and then just stood there staring at me as if it had put her out entirely. She'll take you to your table, put your menus down, and walk away as if she was doing you a favor.

We go out just about every Sunday night and Red Robin used to be one of our regular places to go, although we have not been back for a while. But, last night will be our last. I don't know if is staffing issues or just poor training, but things are just not the same at Red Robin. Despite a number of empty tables, we were told it would be a five minute wait. And they did make us wait five minutes before they seated us. To add to the confusion, they no longer bring silverware and napkins when they seat you. You have to ask for these later. Can you imagine trying to eat a burger without a napkin, or fish without a fork? And the wait staff seem to disappear to the back so my wife had to go up front to get napkins. The staffing shortages seem to extend to the kitchen as well. The time between ordering and receiving your food has certainly extended. Most of the folks around us passed the time on their cell phones. The food quality also varies. My Burning Love Burger was great; same Red Robin burger quality. But, my wife's Fish & Chips was way below par. RR used to produce one of the best Fish & Chips plates around. But, now they have joined the crowd by producing thin over-battered mushy fish.

The guy who served the food though wasn't too happy though. Our waiter was the best, but didn't see him much at times, but it's like he showed up when he was needed! Gave us a root beer float to go even! I got the banzai burger and my bf got the ghost tavern burger. Mine was good, but I like the chicken teriyaki better I think. My bf said his was a small burger, but I didn't look at his plate, I was too busy trying to kick butt at the trivia game on the iPad things they have. The only crappy part, I didn't mean to click it to play.

The last experience was exceptional, it was ok today and here's why:  I had the Pig Out Tavern burger and it was not as warm as I anticipated. I am assuming mind was made prior to my friend's and by the time they made his, it cooled down. I had a double double burger at Del Taco last night and it was much tastier.  For dessert, we had the Doh! Ring Shorty (Cronuts served with blueberry and chocolate syrups), we both agreed that it was definitely better than our burgers.  The customer service however, was on point.  Our experience was great the minute we walked in. There were two hostesses acknowledging us loud and proud as we walked in.  Although it was only 11:45 a.m., I was surprised to see how busy they were.  The good news for us, is that we were seated immediately.  In addition, our waitress took our drink orders almost immediately as well.  She was super friendly and accommodating and answered all our questions and provide recommendations as necessary. Unfortunately, the seats and utensils was kinda dirty. My seat appeared to have something that looked like some sort of gum stain on it and the knife was super dirty. It was kinda gross! As for the price, it was a great deal.  We had the Tavern for two and the price is only $15 plus you get a dessert or appetizer. With a drink, plus tip and taxes, our bill still comes out to be about  $30 because we still left a good tip. After all, we got great service, it's not the waitress fault that the burger wasn't good.

When they brought out my burger, there were like 5 pieces of steak fries. So much for Bottomless Steak Fries! Then I asked for more while my burger is getting cold. I waited for over 10 minutes and then the waitress acts surprised that they hadn't brought me more fries. By this time I had almost finished my entire burger. This is an unacceptable business tactic.

After trying a couple of burgers, the Whiskey River BBQ Burger will always be my favorite! If I'm feeling a little health conscious that day, I'll get the Whiskey River BBQ Chicken Sandwich, but either way, I get the bottomless steak fries! They're so good, they always come out piping hot. Someone in my party usually gets the sweet potato fries, which are bottomless also, and I usually just grab one or two, and those are always crisp and seem freshly fried! If you don't want fries, they offer others sides too, make sure to check to see if they're bottomless or not, so you don't end up paying for an extra side! They offer some sauces free of charge, but they also have ""premium"" sauces for an extra cost. After the first or second round of fries, when you order more they come out a bit slower, but it's fine because I'll sit there and wait. No shame in my game.

If your not a rewards member DO IT! Free burger the month of your birthday, plus other offers. Ordered: FRIED PICKELS - DELICIOUS. I don't like sweet food, however it is a great combo of sweet and spicy with the spicy chiptole sauce. BLEU BURGER - I've had it before, great burger. However at this location wasnt that great. I think what bothered me was that the bun wasnt TOASTY. It just seemed so soft to me and they added some tangy sauce in mine. Not sure if it was a mistake or not. Not much Bleu cheese. SERVICE - Was normal. The waitress attended to me well and answered all my questions. She never asked if I wanted dessert though. After telling her I was getting the free bday burger, maybe she thought her tip increase went out the window. I tip my 15-20% though no matter what.  *update* they accidentally took my fork with my salad, they didn't come back to replace it at all, I was ignored. PLUS eating alone, I guess means no real big tip so no need for great service just passable service. I GUESS ONCE THEY SEE OR THINK YOUR DONE WITH YOUR FOOD, they don't check up on you anymore. Lost a STAR and lost alot of tip. Location is small, I sat by the window, if you LOVE to people watch its cool.

Per tradition, me and my wife go to Red Robin for a free burger. We usually really enjoy this benefit as a customer. We generally like Red Robin burgers. However, this time I have never felt such disrespect. My poor wife went to the entrance, asked if we still have a free burger, perhaps because the benefit expired. We did not look nice as our clothes were disheveled and did not look too presentable as we were busy doing some other chores. The manager approached my wife, took the Red Robin card, returned and shouted at my wife ""Read it!"" My wife was startled. ""Excuse me?"" She was scared. ""Read the receipt!"" She was a little appalled by that comment. Turns out there was a free burger. He walked away. Sheepishly, she asked if she can have the free burger and an extra burger (paid) to-go. Both to be cooked well done. The waitress took the order, and thereafter, when the receipt came, and my wife asked what the total was, the waitress said, ""It's on the receipt!"" Lol... what is wrong with these people and receipts...? I don't understand. When we came home, we opened up the burger, turns out it was so severely undercooked that we had to throw half away.

Last night took the cake and we will not be back.  Started out OK...got sat pretty quickly and our server Jessica was right on top of us asking us for drinks and apps - which was refreshing. I instantly had higher hopes than normal.  We were waiting on my husband to park the car - it was 530ish and the mall lot was packed.  He kindly dropped us at that curb and found parking alone.  She came over at least 3 times in 5 minutes.  My beer and our waters came out quickly.  My hubby arrived and we ordered.  At that point....downhill.  Took 10 minutes fro my husbands beer to arrive.  We asked for a basket of fries early w/ ranch and they arrived with the ranch and HAIR! We notified the MANAGER who said OK, we will get you new ones.  Thought it was a fluke..still not totally down hill. New fries showed up maybe 5 minutes later.  For a place with bottomless fries...don't they just have a guy who makes them as fast as possible?  My daughters food (5YO) arrived early...the mac/cheese and fruit.  To say there was cheese was an understatement! There were maybe 15 noodles in a drowning of cheese sauce..NOTHING like the photo and the runner said and I quote ""that is how it comes out of the bag"".  I said this was not going to fly with our daughter and could she have something else.  The same manager from before came out to ask what was wrong..we said her noodles are swimming in cheese sauce - he offered to add more noodles - not sure where he would get those, strain them from the bag? or get us new food..we said a burger plain. The fruit cup was all brown as though the fruit had been sitting out some time.    My hubby had the fish and chips and I had a banzai - both were OK but nothing to write home about.  Filled my belly - simple.  Then the bill comes.  Not only did they charge for the mac/cheese but took NOTHING off the bill for the horrible kids meal, hair in our food, and having to send stuff back.  I don't fault the waitress for the hair - it happens, but not going to bat with the manger for dollars off and making sure our bill was correct that is on her!  I left as I had enough.  My hubby stayed and all they did was take the extra kids meal off.  I told my hubby to leave 8% as that is what she will be taxed on.  We had two bad interactions that the same manager dealt with and he did nothing.  Food can be so so if the service is excellent..but this is wrong on all levels.  To boot, the placed had ample seating at 530 on a busy weekend at the mall.  Someone at corporate really needs to rethink their training, food prep and service.  If this keeps up they will be out of business.   No more!

42,Ashley T.,"Chino, CA",76,4,1.0,1.0,2017-02-10,Normally I enjoy going to Red Robin however my last experience was terrible. I had ordered their insane romaine salad and being that they give you two large romaine hearts I cut up the entire salad before I began eating. I had taken a few bites when I looked down and saw a hair in the middle of my salad. I was very disgusted and upset because this was the second experience I had at this location finding a hair in my food. I called the manager and was given a replacement salad and offered an apology however I will not be returning to this location since it was the second time I had this issue. It is very upsetting to see a hair in your food and have to go through the trouble to go back to the restaurant after picking up an order while on a lunch break and having to waste a portion of my break.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brea?start=40,2.28,2.77,2.77,2.5640000000000005,2.574

We did ask about there promotion going on the 4 burgers for 6.99 each or something and she didn't really know much of it. We ended up ordering 3 BACON cheeseburgers I even pointed at the menu. And of course some people are picky so we didn't want onions, pickles, or tomato and light mayo. You would think it'll make her writing it down a bit easier but nope. Our food came out and it was nothing from what we had ordered. But a cheese burger with onions and pickles & Relish that they now put on there burgers. We immediately got her attention & mentioned it wasn't what we had ordered & hell went loose from there. Her tone of voice changed saying that's what we ordered when we clearly pointed at the menu saying we wanted BACON cheeseburgers. It was totally her fault for not getting our order right & then she tried to make it seem like we did not know what we ordered at Red Robin when we've been there multiple times! (Of course not the brea mall location). So we finally re ordered & her attitude was just coming off so rude. Saying ""what don't you want in the burger"" as if we were some difficult as customers. Next time someone has a problem or the WAITRESS got their order wrong they should just aplologize & bring them the correct food instead of trying to pick a fight because the customer should always be right.

I've come here a handful of times in the past 6 months and every time the service gets worse. I like Red Robin's ""bottomless fries"" and their burgers are decent.  But man does the service stink!! But yesterday tops every bad service experience. We get there and check in, the hostess advises us there is a about a 10-min wait. No big deal. About 10 minutes of waiting, a family of 3 come in and sit next to us. The manager walks by and waves at them. Less than 5 min later, they are seated by the manager. I asked the hostess if we got there before that family and both hostesses confirm that we were waiting before they arrived and they were not sure why the manager seated them first. A couple minutes later, the manager comes back and seats us, so again - no big deal. We waited for about 10 min before a server comes to our table and apologizes saying she wasn't aware she was assigned to our table. We place our order and it takes literally 30 minutes. So now we have been at Red Robin for a total of 50 minutes and when the food arrives, the fries are hard as a rock as if they had been sitting out for a while. It take an additional 7 minutes for my daughters food to arrive. At this point I am enraged and ask to speak to the manager, the one who sat his friends before us, and rather than apologizing, his defense for seating them first was that he came back within a couple minutes and seated us next.

Then Brittany asked, do you want your free sundae, Of course, i couldnt say no. But i asked, you dont have to sing do you? She sweetly laughed and said, no not necessary.  They had just sang behind me at another table, and frankly, id be too embarassed.  Anyways the sundae came out. Nice vanilla ice cream with some hot fudge,  whipped cream and sprinkles. Nice touch Red Robin! Upon checking out the miniture table top ipad to pay wasnt taking my rewards info correctly. No worries,  I asked Brittany, and swoosh to the rescue she grabbed it and returned 45 seconds later saying all done. This girl was on it. Great service, unfortunately the ipad has a survey you can take, but it ended without the survey. I told her no worry, im a big yelper, and nice tipper and will go over and tell the mgr. I walked towards the back, saw a manager or asst mgr. I asked, are you the manager? He replied, how can I help you? Sharp answer.  I told him about my great experience and only after I saw the man that brought my order in the back, a slim gentleman, bald, it was then this man said he's the big boss, just back from knee surgery 6 weeks ago. He was moving around really well.   Just wanted to say. Point on Red Robin Team.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brea,2.92,2.73,3.212,,2.806
4,Michae L.,"Los Angeles, CA",71,141,204.0,3.0,2017-10-20,Our server was great for sure but when I noticed at the end of the night that I was being charged an entertainment fee by the host just because I ask to be seated by a tv that was showing a specific game.. Come on really?? Charging a entertainment fee is ridiculous. Never heard of any restaurant do this. Minus two stars just because they forgot to mention about a fee which would be applied if you want to be seated at a specific tv. I believe your customers should be aware of these type of charges ahead of time.. My fault for not reviewing my bill before paying for it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brea,2.88,2.71,3.208,,2.7779999999999996

The first time this happened I notified the restaurant and nobody seemed to care.

10,Silvia R.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,36,67.0,4.0,2017-12-04,"First time to this location- we were greeted right away by the hostess and waited about 5 minutes on Sunday evening. Our waitress was Taylor - she was very nice and attentive . Our order consist of : Kids Pepperoni Pizza , A Smoke & Pepper cheeseburger with onions rings , regular cheeseburger and I don't remember the name of the last burger but the description said something about Latin flavors lol. All the burgers were very good, seasoned and cooked well. Onions rings were very good , crispy and fresh . My sons pizza was a bit burned from the edges so we told the waitress , my son decided to still eat it ! He said he liked the little burned edges - haha. Within 5 minutes a manager came to our table and apologized and asked again if we wanted a new one. He was very nice and took the pizza off our bill. I really liked the attention they give here, everything was in a timely manner - the wait and the food. Great experience !!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brea,2.84,2.78,3.2,,2.804
