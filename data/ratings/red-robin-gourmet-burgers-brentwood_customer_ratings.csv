Service has always been slow but ok until a couple of weeks ago. Our waiter was one of the worst.  The place was pretty empty when we were seated. We waited for about 15 minutes for the waiter who showed up looking super grumpy as if we had just ruined his day.  He took our order which was just two burgers, nothing special. Thirty minutes passed and there was no sign of our food or waiter.  I made my way to the rest room and saw him sitting in a booth with other employees laughing away. Was he on break? I don't know but if he was we would've appreciated knowing so we didn't have to sit and wonder what happened.  Our food must have been sitting out for a while because by they time it was served to us, it was barely warm.  Never once did the waiter return to our table to ask if we needed refills or anything else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brentwood?start=360,2.72,2.72,2.72,2.8880000000000003,2.72

386,Francoise B.,"Brentwood, CA",44,34,1.0,3.0,2012-03-27,"I went to this Red Robin for lunch with my husband today. Burgers are always great. We had the Guacamole bacon burger and the mushroom burger. The issue today was more with service and attitude and the bottomless fries policy.  The idea of having as many fries as you want is a great one at first sight. However, not when the corporate office puts limits on it. When we talked about it with our waiter, it told us that the corporate office puts a limit of 3 oz of fries per serving (we counted about 6 fries). So when you first get your order all you get is about half a dozen fries. Then it takes the waiter forever to bring you more when you ask for more and again you get about 3oz as per the corporate policy, then again if you want 6 more fries you wait even longer. At each round the wait is longer. So I say get rid of this offer which is bogus, bring a nice serving of fries with the original order and be done with it, since Red Robin is being cheap about it. I am going to write the corporate office about this. The waiter tried to be accommodating as much as he could. Not a fun experience. My husband and I decided that when we go back we will immediately ask for our refill when we give the order so we can have at least 12 fries each when we first get our burger. Because by the time we ask for our second basket we will be done with our burger. That's how long it took this time and we don't eat fast.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brentwood?start=380,2.8,2.8,2.8,2.9240000000000004,2.8

Our waitress walked up a few minutes after we sat down and took our drink order... Our drinks took 15mins to get (they were NOT busy at all and we were sitting right next to the bar). When she finally brought our drinks, she also took our orders, 3 cheeseburgers all with NO tomato and a salad with ranch. Well a half an hour later when our food finally arrived, one cheeseburger had tomato on it, one order had 3 french fries in the basket and the other cheeseburger was cooked wrong. The salad was great. Our waitress wasnt seen again until she brought us the bill. We needed a new bottle of ketchup, so we grabbed one from another table which was empty as well. So I tok both bottles to the bar tender and oh look there was my waitress standing and talking not doing anything. She said she would bring a new bottle of ketchup so I walked back to the booth. Well it appears she forgot, because as she took drinks to a table near us she asked the bartender to bring us ketchup..... A manager walked by a few times but didnt smile, or even acknowledge us.

333,Sarah M.,"Manteca, CA",218,263,420.0,2.0,2012-10-15,"Met an old friend for lunch today because Brentwood was a good halfway point for us. I had only eaten at Red Robin like once before and it was a while ago so I did not really remember the menu. I have to say I was not impressed both by their selection or by the taste of the food. I think that is the reason I have not gone back. My memory was refreshed.  After staring at the menu for what seemed like forever I finally made a selection. They pretty much have burgers, sandwich, and salads none of which sounded that great. I finally settled on the Guacamole Bacon Burger and chose Mac and Cheese for the side instead of the fries. I enjoy eating and when I have to settle on something at a restaurant that is usually not a good sign. I can usually find something I actually want to try. Well the burger was a huge disappointment. The bacon just looked gross and tasted just as gross so I took it off. The guacamole was devoid of any flavor and so was the meat. So basically what I had was an overpriced flavorless burger. I asked for a side of pickles and they made the burger tolerable and I ate about half of it. The Mac and Cheese, however, was really good. I am glad I ordered that as a side. I ate all of that. The customer service was ok for the most part. Nothing outstanding or memorable. When I wanted a Dr. Pepper I had to flag someone down because our waiter was nowhere to be found. Would I go back? Probably not. I do not mean just this specific location but Red Robin in general. I just don't like their food selection. Nothing seemed that good to me. We have one in my hometown of Manteca so I do have access if I wanted to go.  I prefer small hole in the wall places to big chain restaurants to start off with and if I do go to chain restaurant I can think of quite a few that I know I like alot better than this place. If I ever go back to a Red Robin again it will be at someone else's choosing; like for their birthday or something. Other than that I would choose to eat elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brentwood?start=340,3.48,3.48,3.48,2.3120000000000003,3.4800000000000004
319,Jessica M.,"Brentwood, CA",34,17,,2.0,2012-11-03,"My husband and I recently went here for lunch and although the service was not great I chose to go back today because I was craving their BLTA croissant and fries. I took my 5-year old daughter with me and we were seated right away. Our uninterested waitress came to take our drink and food order, and after I received my water (without the lemon I requested) our waitress never returned to check on us. It took 30 minutes for me to receive my lunch order (my daughter didn't want anything so it was just the one plate) and I literally watched as my sandwich sat on the food line for at least 12 minutes. My sandwich was soggy and the fries were cold and tasted a day old. I received one water refill from another waitress passing by and yet another waitress eventually brought my food over. Each time I saw my waitress pass, she never made eye contact so I couldn't wave her over. Finally, as I'm halfway through the sandwich I'm forcing myself to eat, our waitress comes over to see if we need anything, so I ask for the campfire sauce I originally requested with my order but did not receive. It took a few minutes, but she eventually brought it. Overall, we were there for an hour for one lousy meal. Luckily, my daughter was very patient. In addition to MY poor experience: As I was watching the food line I saw another waitress poking her finger into a cheeseburger that I assume she was about to serve to another patron.

Most of the time, servers are very attentive and nice.  I think the prices are a little high though.  Women's bathroom needs work.  Stalls so small you can barely pull down your pants and when you wipe you hit your head on the door. In the two non handicap stalls you can see the other stall through the toilet paper roll area very clearly. Not good since the restaurant is kid friendly.

RR had it neatly set up and reserved. Great. The downside is that the host/seater was rude to several members of the party who arrived a bit before the majority of the group. Her point was that the whole group had to be there to be sat. No problem if you are taking up regular space while people are waiting but in this case the Set up reserved table was sitting empty and the people in our party had arrived taking up lobby space. Why not filter where they need to go so as to ease up the lobby? Win-win. I guess not sadly.  Next we start to order but our server doesn't want to do separate checks saying that it will be trouble for us with the kitchen. Unfortunately, we must as in a group of 30 plus, some only have credit cards and we didn't want the server to have to figure individual items out later. We should have listened if we could have because the server was right. The food came out at different times so people eating together didn't get their food at even near he same time.  The second mini group to order was the last to be served. Waiting made loads of other food cold. Apparently one side of the kitchen can get food out fast, the other not so much and since there were tickets from our party in both kitchens, disaster.  They should look into why that is? The burgers here are divine and the fries are good when served hot. The beer is cold, the water flows and the new specialty beverages are delish. Sports are on the tvs and the atmosphere is like a loud backyard party.  The server was courteous and refilled the drinks, refilled  fries, etc in a timely way. The food was fresh and enjoyable.

The first time we went service was pretty slow, but the restaurant was almost brand new so we gave it a pass.  I don't remember exactly what we ordered, but the food was fine. Second time I made the mistake of ordering a fish sandwich.  Once I got it the sandwich was very tasty...once I got it.  We watched other tables sit, give their order, get their food, and leave before I got my sandwich!  I would have been happy to reorder something else if the fish sandwich was so terribly difficult to make, but was never given the opportunity.  We just keep being told ""It's on its way out.""  I know it was my sandwich too because while my sandwich was good, my husband and daughter's burgers had that soggy bun ""under the lamps too long"" yuk going on.

Immediately upon entering the restaurant I was greeted with the substandard customer service experience I have become used to at this location.  When I asked for a booth instead of a table the hostess stated that it was not possible to place a high chair at the end of the booth because it was a fire hazard. Even after explaining it was done there many times in the past, she not only refused to do it but was extremely rude about it. How this is a fire safety hazard when it does not reduce the wide walk way much at all is beyond me, however being polite I'm certain is not a safety hazard. Nor is refraining from walking by the table glaring at us.  The food was overall good with a few exceptions: 1) One meal not made as ordered. 2) Sweet potato fries delivered cold to adult customer even after having to wait extended time after other food for them to be available; yet were given to children so hot they had to let them cool a little before eating them.

295,Jacqueline S.,"Tucson, AZ",13,84,11.0,1.0,2014-02-17,"After living in Tucson for 12 years, you start to like some chain restaurants and Red Robin was one I was always a big fan of. My mom and I would make the 40 minute drive, sometimes solely to go and eat there. So I was incredibly disappointed after my experience there tonight. We walked in around 8:50 and there was still quite a few diners there however there was no seating hostess to be found. An older lady from the bar approached my boyfriend and I, and I asked if we could be seated at a half booth. She then asked if I wanted just a booth, and I repeated that I'd like a half booth half table. At that point the actual hostess appeared and I repeated my request. She led us first to the left side of the restaurant where there wasn't an actual table where we could be seated. She took us back to the front of the restaurant and told us to hold on so she could clear off a different table on the other side of the dining room. She seated us and was very nice so I thought, 'okay this isn't so bad.'  We were seated relatively close to the kitchen so we were able to hear some chit chat from that area, which was fine until one of the waitresses started swearing profusely about having to split a check. She was clearly very upset (understandable as waiting isn't an easy job) but there is a time and place to vent such frustrations and as a customer I shouldn't be able to hear it. Throughout our time there she sat at a table behind us with three other waitresses (they were supposedly rolling silverware) and she was being loud and complaining the whole time. At one point a manager approached and told them that they needed to get up, to which she responded with something like 'It's been a really long night, I shouldn't even be rolling silverware.' I just couldn't believe she was behaving in such a way. The customer service industry isn't easy, but it's a job and if you don't like it then you should probably find another one.  The entire time we were there, all the tables around us that had had diners remained covered in plates and dirty napkins. It wasn't until I was walking out the door that a single buser came to clean off the table tops. No one else considered it worthwhile. I've never seen tables at a restaurant stay dirty for anywhere near that amount of time.  Our waitress came and took our drink orders and then came back for our diner orders. However, once our food came out, my basket was full to the brim and my boyfriend's looked sad and empty. He had 8 fries, whereas I had at least 20. Our waitress never spoke directly to my boyfriend, never refilled his drink or asked about his food. I had to ask her to refill his drink and to bring us more fries. He felt pretty badly about the lack of consideration and acknowledgment he received and actually left the restaurant to wait in the car. I went to speak with the manager who at first wasn't very approachable. She said she would check on our order of fries and come back out. I went back to our table (the fries had already come out) and waited for her. I couldn't see her in the kitchen, so I decided to leave. On the way out I approached the same older lady who had come to seat us earlier so that she could let the manager know that we got our fries and I had left. She basically dismissed me with a look and so I left. I will NEVER return to this Red Robin again. I am absolutely appalled by the way they treat their customers. Luckily I live in an area where unless it is late (which is why we went to Red Robin in the first place) there are many delicious food options. This experience really left a bad taste in my mouth for not only Red Robin but for chain restaurants as a whole. If being a chain means that employees think that they can put in less work then I don't care to spend my money there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brentwood?start=260,2.64,2.95,2.95,2.02,2.8260000000000005

With the exception of mine and my Husband's first visit here which was ''ok'' (not great but not terrible) every other one has been so bad I actually emailed corporate. Let's break this down: - Inconsistent food - Half of the staff could not care less. - Pick and choose which discounts and Birthday deals they honor. - All meals never come out at once. - Always over cook the Burgers.  - Place is always untidy (dirty plates left on unoccupied tables for long periods of time) Each visit here we found the food to be on the decline until one day we came in and I was served bad (as in foul tasting) Chicken. My Chicken Ensenada Platter came out way before my Husbands with the server stating that my Husbands was ''just coming''. Great.. we don't mind waiting but I had no cutlery to eat my meal with which is fine if it was a Burger but I'm not an animal, eating Chicken Breast and Salad with my hands just wasn't going to happen. We sat trying to get the servers attention for 10 minutes before she came back over. My Husbands meal still not in sight and mine now gone fairly cold. His meal came 8 minutes later (yes, I timed it). As for the food that visit.. yuk! My Chicken was rubbery with a foul taste and my Husbands ''Medium'' Burger was way over cooked to the point of being chewy and dry. We left saying that would be our last visit. However, after emailing corporate about the issues I got a call from the manager of this location offering me a gift card to return ''on him'' with hopes to impress us next time. He did state that when we go in we should say that we're returning after a poor experience. Did I? Hell no.. That's almost as bad as going into a restaurant telling staff you Yelp. It would also defeat the whole point as they would be likely to go out of their way to try impress only then to go back to the same crappy experience we had before.  I was right not to say anything either because although the experience was marginally better the food and service was still pretty bad. I've been to quite a few Red Robin locations and this is the worst so far.

I looked around and saw that the amount of folks eating couldn't be more than 50..I asked, this is a restaurant right? You do serve food, right? She answered yes to both questions but, reiterated that the kitchen is way backed up and any orders will be delayed. You know, here's a business that caters to people eating and ordering foods, but, they are in dire straights when consumers have to be told that the kitchen is real backed up!

So a waitress comes by to fill our drinks and she pours water all over the table, creating a gigantic mess of water across both myself and the table, as well as a huge puddle on the ground where the water is falling onto. Normally I wouldn't be bothered too much by this, as mistakes happen. But the waitress looks at it, says nothing and walks away. No apologies, no ""I'll be right back,"" nothing. So I assume she's on her way to clean up the mess, except 10 minutes goes by and she never comes to clean it up. Obviously irate by this, I called the manager over. The manager did not offer an apology or any form of compensation, offering the excuse that the waitress was new and had not yet been properly trained to clean it up when she makes a mess. Are you kidding me? I left a $0.00 tip, deservedly so. I've never seen such incompetent management at any restaurant.

It was not busy at all.  Ordered some sodas and apps, then our main meals. Apps came out fast and were delicious as usual.  Food came. I wasn't too hungry so I just had some of my boyfriend's bottomless sweet potato fries. When we asked for the second batch they were ICE cold. Seemed like they were cooked and then placed in the fridge. I was super tired anyways, so I decided to have ""one last fry"" a call it a meal.. well that last fry was a huge mistake.. I almost CHOKED on the longest piece of hair. Ew. I was SO disgusted.  I get it, I used to wait tables, HAIR HAPPENS. It may not even be your hair.. and you have no control over it. What I didn't like is that when I kindly let the server know, she decided to speak to me like a baby and say ""oh no, do you want me to get you some to-go"" I felt mocked, and that it was VERY rude..  Because of how tired I was and with a long drive ahead of me, I said no thank you and the check would be fine.. I was in no mood to argue.  Sure enough, got the check, and nothing has been taken off or discounted. I thought that was really poor on the servers end.... If I were her, I  would of walked straight to management, let them know of the situation, and see what we could of done for the customers.

Possibly the same sort of lesson Rihanna learned after Chris brown whooped her a**.  People don't often really change. I can not tell you how many chances I have given this Red Robin location . Every single burger i have ordered here in the past few months has been luke-warm, as well as their ""bottomless"" fries. Sorry Red Rocket, but as long as you keep pumping out those mediocre frozen french fries, there's no need for that lack of a bottom. Oh and don't even get me started on the fact that they started charging for the dipping sauces they offer for the fries there....the one god damn thing that kept bringing  me back is now up-charged.

Waited 28 minutes after our order was taken and when our food finally came out. (I noticed we weren't the only table looking grumpy at the long wait time for our meal. I saw at least 2 other tables questioning to themselves or their friends about where the server was and why the food was taking so long.)  Throughout the 28 minute wait (yes, I timed it), our server never once came over to tell us something along the lines of ""I'll check on your food"", ""I'm not sure what's taking so long, let me look"". Instead, a manager noticed our slightly unhappy demeanor as we were very hungry and came over to ask if maybe there was something wrong with the food. He was very considerate and immediately went to find out what happened to our meal. After asking our server, he came back to inform us that another server accidentally gave my dad's burger to another customer and we were waiting for another one to be made. As much as I appreciate the manager taking the time to let us know of the situation, I feel like it's part of the server's job to let us know. Unfortunately, I didn't happen to get the manager's name, but I really appreciated his concern and helpfulness!  I ordered the Buzz Clucks & Mac 'N' Cheese. I found the buzz clucks to be too intense in flavor. I couldn't taste the chicken. All I could taste was the overwhelming BBQ breading that surrounded the chicken. I was so grateful for the ranch sauce so I could smother it in ranch. It wasn't spicy, there was just too much breading that drew me away for the chicken. Originally I was assuming that it was being served as chicken tenders with either a BBQ dip on the side or had the sauce on it instead of a full-blown breading attack to the palette... On the other hand, I enjoyed the Mac 'N' Cheese that came with it. Super hot, temperature-wise, but delicious. I wouldn't order this again as much as I love Mac 'N' Cheese.  My dad ordered the Red's Big Tavern Burger with a Diet Coke. The burger was fine, seemed smaller than usual even though he ordered the larger portion. Typically, servers would ask if he would like a refill on his soda, but she never came to ask. He was disappointed in that as he tends to finish his drink quickly. (Yes, I know he could've asked, but seeing as we were both famished for not eating breakfast so we could watch The Avengers: Age of Ultron, we weren't exactly in an asking mood.)  Overall, food was just average. Not too thrilled about our server; she was nice but she also happened to disappear a lot when you needed her for something...

Furthermore, whoever was working in the kitchen and made my food completely messed up my order.  I ordered the fiery ghost tavern style tavern double, which is my favorite,  but the only thing that was on my burger when it arrived was the fresh jalapeños.  The fried jalapeños, tomato, and lettuce were missing from my burger. I had to ask our waiter about the missing items. He went to the kitchen and came back with the fried jalapeños.  Also there were less then 8 of the steak fries in the basket with my burger. Needless to say I was not amused with my favorite burger being below the normal level I am used to.  On a positive note, our waiter Jonny was beyond amazing.

Drinks arrived in a fair amount of time (15-20 minutes) and not long after our kids meals arrived. The kids both ordered Mac and cheese. Their meals arrived cold and extremely watery. Neither kid really complained because they were hungry but both my wife and I noticed. Our meals arrived some twenty minutes later. No real complaints about our meals, they tasted the way burgers should taste. The complaints are more about the service.  Our server was horrible. She had three tables to wait on and somehow couldn't manage any of them. She would attend to one and ignore the others, never bothering to ask if the other tables needed anything as she walked past. Twice we requested another set of silverware and extra napkins.  Overall it was just not up to our expectations, and as a regular diner at Red Robin our expectations are not very high.

We had to flag her down and after 30 min had to go get the check myself. The little electronic device that I just had to touch to pay for my check was so disgusting and covered with food. When I asked why all the tables were dirty she said bus boy was on break... We looked at her like why are you and your other employees standing around instead of cleaning?

Black, dry and tastless. My wifes burger had two small pieces of bratwurst which were also burnt and dry. Her sweet potato fries were cold. Not ""taken from the fryer and left on the counter"" kind of cold. But literally still cold in the center from the freezer. Our waitress never came by to see if we needed anything. It wasnt until we summoned her from the little electronic gadget on the table that she came. ""More fries?"" No thanks, still defrosting the ones you brought us earlier.  We decided to push our luck with dessert. Had to order from the little electronic gadget again. Went for the cheesecake. When the waitress brought it to us, we requested more napkins. As I cut into the cheesecake, I realized it was still frozen. We all ate our frozen cheescakes. Never did get those napkins.  Had to pay using that electronic gadget. First time, it said it was unable to process. Started over and was successfull the second time. When i got home, I found out that the payment went through twice.

Well when we were going to be seated they brought us over to a booth and she had a booster seat with her... she then asked me if the booth would work for us, i told her ""yes if my niece can reach in a highchair not a booster"" she then looked over and there was an empty table in the middle of the dining room, where we were smooshed in like sardines (we ended up lowering 2 of the leafs on the table so the people around us had some wiggle room and the table was dirty). We sat patiently and our server came.. of course it started out smoothly.. ordered our drinks and appetizers and to my surprise they came out in a timely manner.  Now mind you we are still smooshed like sardines, we see that a big party had left and asked if we could be moved to that table since we were a little tight at our table and our server said yes that she wouldn't mind and she would get someone to clean the table... we waited and waited and waited... our food came and we asked about the table again and the servers response was ""I asked someone to clean it, but I don't know what happened but here is your food""... I think I had a WTF look on my face at this point. So of course the usual question "" is there anything i can bring you?"" Ummmmm how did she not see all of our empty cups?? We asked for refills and I asked her for ranch for our fries... also by the time she came back with only 1 side of ranch for 4 people we figured out my brothers burger had nothing but meat cheese and bacon, no lettuce, no tomato.. we asked her for a side of it to which she looked at us like we asked her for something foreign.  Ugh, i was irritated at this point that i just wanted to leave but we ate.... at the end we were never asked if we needed a to go box... we only got an attitude when we asked for the bill and she told us if we weren't paying with cash we could just pay on the machine.

When we got seated it was obvious why there's a wait; the middle section was served by only one server.  It took 10 minutes to ask us what drinks we wanted, then an additional 30+ minutes for the food.  Apparently they have two separate kitchens in terms of dividing the items like salad and burgers. While our burgers were ready, getting cold, they had to still make the salad. The men's bathroom was disgusting, the urinal didn't flush so I used the stall (which I recommend you using the furthest from the door because it has more room).

One dish came out wrong, and was sent back. She brought back the dish, with a half ass ""I know you said no mayonaise, but there was only a little bit of mayonaise that was on there. They still took it back and made you a new one"". Who says that? It was a pretty lengthy wait time (about 1 hr) for all the food to come out on a Monday night.

We arrived later than we would have liked (6:45 pm) but I wanted to see how it would be when it's actually truly busy. 25 minutes to be seated + 7 minutes for server to come to our table + 12-15 minutes for order to come = reasonable enough wait experience for time of day. The manager had called me the week prior to apologize for the issues we had with wait and poor quality. They took reasonable steps to encourage us to give it another try. Our server was Kim and she went out of her way to accommodate us. Both managers, Bill and Steve(?), even helped. I saw them moving around the restaurant floor helping different tables so I won't assume it was just us they were trying to please (though perhaps a little more intently due to my previous review).  What helped greatly was that we ordered our food to be brought out all at once and with the extra fries as well (as suggested by Bill). We also specified the condiments at that time. Not sure if it was the way we ordered, the server or the manager's knowledge of my previous review but things moved rather quickly. It may have been all of the above.  Overall it was a descent experience. My husband and I both ordered the whiskey river chicken and sandwich and our eldest son the burger version. I didn't much like the my sandwich but that's my own preferential issue. It was seasoned enough. Our eldest ""LOVED"" his mean and our other two enjoyed their pizza and grilled cheese sandwich bites. Husband said he liked the hamburger patties version of the whiskey river over the chicken sandwich version. That's all. Hope this helps someone in their own decision futuristically.

Then they replaced all of their lights with LED's and they put in so many it was as bright as  an operating room, it would give me a headache, and so we stopped going.  2 weeks  ago my daughter asked if we could go to Red Robin for dinner and I agreed to give it another chance.    First, I was happy to see that the lights had been toned down.  The restaurant was clean (and basically empty which isn't surprising on a weekday) . The waitress greeted us almost 10 minutes after we were seated and we ordered our drinks and an appetizer. Except she wouldn't order our appetizer, she said we had to use a machine on the table that was covered in fingerprints to order it, I didn't even want to touch it, it was gross. The waitress was super out of it.  My daughter never got her soda.  The waitress kept forgetting we existed.  She mostly spent her time chatting with someone by the kitchen. By the time we got our food it was cold.  She would  walk by to check on one of her other tables and then go ""oh, oops!  I'll get you that soda"" etc... and then forget us again. Maybe she was stoned? The hilarious part was when she told me I had to use the dirty machine to pay the check and then she asked me to please give her a perfect  review after paying the check because it would really help her.  We still had not received the boxes we requested or my daughters soda! A week after the disaster above my daughter asked if we could pick up burgers to-go after our hike.  She called the order in and they told us it would be ready in 15 minutes.  I arrived on time and waited 45 minutes longer for our food.  The bartender was awesome and apologized profusely and she really felt bad about it, but management should have stepped in.   There were 3 other groups of people with me waiting for their food to come out and others arriving.

Two grown women. One immediately says that she isn't hungry and the other, again, is taking pictures and checking her apps for updates and what-not. Despite all that, the hostess was kind and directed me to the bar (HEY NOW) when I told her that I was gonna order to go. Apparently, when you order to go, you'll be by the bar and you'll order your meal through the bartender.  Bartender was super nice. Gave me the menu. Obviously I was into getting a burger, but what kind of burger? Do I take the chili cheese burger? Do I go grab this Philly like cheese steak burger? Then my eye caught this Guac Bacon burger. Told myself that this was the healthy option among the burgers and ordered it. The bartender told me that it would take about fifteen minutes or so before my food was ready. That didn't happen. It take about seven minutes flat. He was surprised at how fast it came out, and I was surprised how fast it came out. As we walked out of the restaurant, I inwardly hoped that the food wasn't a mess and underdone because of how quick it came out of the kitchen. Guac Burger essentials: gauc, bacon, patty, swiss cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, onions, and mayo. Normally this wouldn't sound good to me. BUT I was hungry. So bite after bite I went through the burger. It's a big burger. The size was impressive. Even the amount of fries that they gave me was good. But the patty was a bit well done and I had asked for it to have more pink in it. There was hardly any guac in the burger too. I barely even tasted it. There was nothing in this item that amazed me. It was just another burger that I would eat because I was hungry. It wasn't something I would try again. The fries too had issues. Sure, there were a lot of fries.

Why is no one running food for an overwhelmed bartender? Why is there only one bartender on a weekend evening? Why is the only person behind the bar making shakes all night?

It took 1 hour for it to come. 4 burgers....so...clearly not that hard. I looked at the kitchen, cooks were eating french fries and drinking while cooking. Also, one was rubbing eyes and face and then placed food on plate with bare hands. The waiter was holding a plate to the lamp to reheat before serving....it was quite a sight. Finally our meals came, which I was already turned off. I got my burger, cut in half, it was bloody. I ordered ""well well done"". I sent it back, refused to pay for it. Decided to skip eating. After waiting another 30 minutes for receipt we were told we could check out on kiosk. It is the LAST time I will give red Robin my business.....especially since they are charging $14 foe a burger. I suggest you do the same.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brentwood?start=260,1.96,1.86,2.372,2.02,1.9000000000000001

First off the service was mediocre at best , the staff is more like high school graduates having a good time.  The food was just throwin together with no pride on how it looked or tasted. ""We we're not the only ones having issues with our food"" , from the time we sat down there was people complaining about the same issues . We we're thinking they were picky people and we shouldn't have the same issues . I ordered the A-1 peppercorn burger with the works and got a bun,2pieces of red onion, a burnt patty with cold melted cheese , 1 slice smashed tomatoe , and a silver dollar size splash of A-1 sauce topped off with the bun . Wife's chicken sandwich was a fried patty sitting on top of pickles, shredded tomatoes,  and a pile of lettuce.  Not much quality control here if they keep this up I can't see the being open very much longer.

It didn't take long to get seated, but once seated everything seemed to take a while.  Our waiter didn't come to our table for quite a bit, he was very nice but nothing was explained to us. We didn't know we had to use the ""Ziosk"" to place  our appetizer order, refills, or even pay our bill. He said he only takes the main order .  We placed our appetizer order, but he still had to help us because neither of the two ziosks were working properly, very poor system. When our appetizers came they didn't give us plates and you couldn't get anyone to stop to ask for them. Besides, anytime we asked for anything it seemed as though they wouldn't come back for about 10-15 minutes. As for the appetizer, don't bother with the chips, guacamole and salsa. The serving of the guacamole is about 2 tablespoons. I had to laugh that one off. The onion rings and fried pickles were ok. We order our main dishes, peppercorn burger, southern charm burger, jalapeño burger, chicken tenders and shrimp, and chicken salad. It was okay. Definitely not the same quality of food from when we use to go to the Sunvalley Mall location years ago.

So I killed it and went on with our conversation. Almost 45 minutes later we received our 2 burgers lukewarm and our fries cold. Between that time we killed a few more ants. After we got our food we saw the ants on the back side of the table. We kept trying to get our waiters or managers attentions no one came. So we started putting the ants on a napkin.

163,Marie O.,"Brentwood, CA",2,143,21.0,1.0,2016-07-26,This was our first visit to Red Robin. We wanted to have a good burger so thought we would give it a try since we had just been to the Movies. There were only a few people in the restaurant so even though some people will use that as a reason for bad service...it shouldn't be....but that wasn't the case anyway. The service was bad. I don't have names but the Greeter at the front door with long brown hair was genuinely friendly and nice. But the young girl with blonde hair that was our server was fake friendly and definitely needs better training. We have never been to Red Robin...so when it came time to order she made us feel dumb that we didn't know to order our drinks ourselves with the table kiosk. Upon taking our order my husband ordered a Regular Cheeseburger with the Chili and I had the Burnin Love with No Cheese and Garlic Fries.  So we got our food...They brought my husbands chili first. It was only flavorful because of the onions tossed on top other than that...so bland. When they brought our burgers I received regular fries not garlic. My husbands burger came with fries as well...but Why? He had substituted chili for the fries. Well we know why...the server wasn't paying attention..ordered the chili as an addition..so instead of $1.79 chili we were charged 3.59...plus we were charged for garlic fries we did not receive. This girl was clueless. And she did one of my pet peeves when it comes to female servers. She just assumed my husband was paying as she kept directing all her attention to him. Believe me ..we are old enough to be her grandparents so I know it wasn't flirtatious...but I do think she was looking for a good tip..Surprise surprise...I paid the check.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brentwood?start=160,1.6,1.81,2.32,2.2760000000000002,1.7260000000000004

The poor manager, nice white guy, is constantly taking over tables and comping checks. Today I had to send the hostess to hunt down the server after sitting 15min and nobody came over to even get our drinks. She seemed annoyed, didn't even apologize.

52,Justin B.,"Livermore, CA",1557,258,124.0,2.0,2016-08-02,"I have come to the conclusion that all Red Robins are the same. I have been to 3 different locations, each and every single one of them are the same. One is no longer open and who knows what will happen to the other two!  We had a new waitress who was training, but she had someone walking around with her. If he is the one that is doing the training and he is forgetting certain items as well, then she is going to be in trouble.  I had ordered broccoli instead of french fries. Order came with fries. Once delivered I had brought it to there attention and they acted like it was news to them. The trainer said he would get the broccoli for me. A few minutes later the new waitress said that the broccoli was coming. Needless to say, 30 minutes later the broccoli never showed up!  Another thing that irritates me is how long the tables stay dirty for. The same group of tables stayed dirty the whole time we were there, which was a little over an hour. If you are a server, you can make more money if you clean your own tables as well to get more people sitting there.  My last pet peeve with all RR's is: They have these new things on the table where you can order food and drinks. However you have to wait for the server to turn it on for you to do so. Every waiter or waitress will ask if you want any appetizers. Then they tell you to order them on the new table gadget. Whats the point of asking, if they are then going to tell you to do it on the table gadget but they have to turn it on for you.  Don't expect great service. Just expect a meal that might be what you actually ordered.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brentwood?start=40,1.64,1.83,2.328,2.3440000000000003,1.7540000000000002

The Kitchen Manager Erick D. messaged me back today and  wanted me to contact him, to go over what our experience was the day of the review. After talking to him he invited us back to give them another shot. So here's what happened... When we arrived we asked to talk to Erick but I guess he was busy in the kitchen and the acting GM Matt came out to greet us. It was a Sat night and the place was busy. I wasn't too concerned about what our service was going to be like because we were invited to come back so I figured that they would take very good care of us. We arrived approx 6:10 PM and were sat by 6:14. The whole process took about about 45 mins from there, we were out the door and on our way by 7 pm. Matt checked on us several times and eventually Erick came by to introduce himself. All in all, it was a good experience the food came out prompt and our server Kadisha, Di Di for short (sorry if I butchered the spelling Kadisha) was very nice and attentive. We had very good service. The whole time I was looking around to see what everyone else's service was like. Here's what I noticed... Our server Kadisha was very attentive to ALL of her tables, she would do a quick scan and clear plates and get refills before people drinks got too low. Matt did check on us a few times but he was also checking on everyone else in our section. The Hostess staff were constantly walking in our area and setting up table or double checking them to make sure they could seat people promptly. The bus staff was on point clearing tables when patrons would leave. It didn't seem like anyone in our area was waiting around for their food to come out of the kitchen, so I could assume the kitchen staff was in there rocking it. All this would tell me that last Wednesday was just an off day. 4 Stars because I am a fan of Red Robin, the wife and I really do enjoy the food and their fun atmosphere.

Meat was made to my liking (med. rare) and the fries were hot and freshly prepared.  Kid #1 got the Reds burger and #2 got cluck-a-doodles (chicken tenders). Ryan was our server.

I was seated quickly and the man who greeted me and my party was very friendly but from there, the rest of the experience went downhill. We had two waitresses, both of whom made ordering a bit difficult and confusing when it shouldn't be. After waiting a long time for the food to finally arrive, the bacon on my sandwich was ice cold and they charged me for avocado yet one half had no avocado on it while the other had two small little chunks which, in my opinion is not worth being charged for. The fries didn't taste all that fresh either. The best thing about this meal was the milk shake as it was super good but that's not enough to really make this a good experience for me. I would have said something about my meal but the service was just too slow to risk sitting there even longer, so I decided not to make a fuss.

Attempted to do a pickup order on two different occasions, as our dining experience here is as to be expected for a chain restutant. 1st experience we decided to call in our order, an appetizer, 2 adult meals and a kids meal. For 1 of the adult meals a special request was made to exclude items from the meal, pretty typicasl and no hesitation from the order taker. Was quoted 20 minutes. I arrived 25 minutes later, and our meal wasn't ready. 15 minutes later they come out with the meal. I immediately check the special order, and it's wrong. So another 10 minutes to make it right. I was offered a free shake that I accepted for the trouble. After getting our meal and arriving home I learned that the other adult meal wasn't even what we asked for, I simply didn't check because it should have been straight forward. I called back and the Manager agreed to refund our meal onto a gift card and send it to us. I agreed. Never received the gift card. Our 2nd experience tonight I decided to do an online order that said my meal, special requests and all, would be done in 17 minutes. I arrived 25 minutes later and was told they were bagging up my order. 15 minutes later I had to ask again, finally my order came out, it was correct but the fries were cold. I was told it would take 10 minutes for new fries. Seriously!? You advertise everywhere bottomless fries, even McDonald's has fries on stand by at all times.

Conveniently my birthday is in November so I was able to join their loyalty program and also get a free birthday burger. We went at 9pm on Saturday and were initially told it would be a 30 min wait, but it ended up only being about 10 minutes. Our server was very upbeat and friendly. I'm not a vegetarian but I don't eat beef. Initially I was leaning toward a turkey burger, but the veggie burger caught my eye. Our server said they had just revamped it to be a lot better than their previous version, so I decided to give it a try. I loved all the components of the veggie burger and it tasted great. Red Robin has several dipping sauces for the fries - some are free and some have a slight upcharge. We liked the ranch and campfire (creamy BBQ), but weren't fans of the Red's secret tavern sauce. Overall we enjoyed our visit to Red Robin. While our meal this time was free (and yes we did tip the server well), the menu prices are very reasonable and we would go back. Edit: Forgot to add that my bf was given a nice thank you card for Veterans Day, that was hand signed by several of the employees. I thought this was a very thoughtful gesture.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brentwood,2.24,2.41,2.164,,2.3420000000000005

61,Richard H.,"Oakley, CA",0,3,,1.0,2017-11-26,"After eating here tonight tonight I left feeling like I ate at a fast food restaurant.  Our server had the personality of a wet sponge.  Which means no personality.  Our entree's came with chicken but we had to ask for knives.  My husbands burger came out missing items that would make it a sriracha burger over a cheese burger.  That was brought to the servers attention and he asked my husband to check 'under the meat'.  Nope nothing there.  I had a salad that says it comes with garlic bread, that wasn't on the plate.  I had water (which tasted a little off)  and was never offered a re-fill nor was my husband offered a refill on his ice tea.   My husband was never offered or asked if he wanted more  fries.  On reviewing the bill we noticed that we'd been charged for two Sriracha burgers.  One would think that this young man would have been  trained before being put on the floor.  But if he was 'trained' I won't recommend this place or try again.  The restaurant in Sun Valley sucks too and hoped the Brentwood one would be better.  With so many other restaurants in our area RR is off our list.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brentwood?start=60,2.16,2.41,2.16,,2.3100000000000005
33,Kalie C.,"Antioch, CA",0,9,8.0,3.0,2017-12-02,yesterday my son chose this place after being really good at his physical therapy (he's 4) and everything was fine paid for the dumb game and told him he could get whatever he wanted...The waitress was sweet and fast... . But we were seated between two different couples both discussing their custody of their kids and both got pretty heated. Like cursing and bringing up old fights and at one point a dad stormed out and never came back ...Here I am trying to color and play with my son with all this negative arguing and I don't care who cheated Rebecca it's still his daughter too.

21,Yru M.,"Antioch, CA",0,1,,5.0,2017-12-03,"It has been a while, since, I have been to Red Robin. Because, I felt the service had gone down hill.  The food and especially the soda machine. Always water down drinks. So, I went yesterday. I have to say, since they remodeled. The service was outstanding, food and now the carbonation for the soda was on point. And I see why, the manger was as outstanding as his employees. Working being a team player. Even in the kitchen. Leading by example. One word for Red Robin. Outstanding Service!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brentwood?start=20,2.16,2.47,2.172,,2.3460000000000005
8,cheryl j.,"Pleasanton, CA",3,11,10.0,2.0,2017-12-13,"We came to Red Robin to get lunch one day and I ordered the whiskey river bbq burger and asked for a side salad instead of fries. When our food came out I noticed the salad looked funny, First I noticed the lettuce was not cut good at all, It was in really big pieces and did not look like something you'd expect to get from a restaurant. Then I noticed it had brown wilt marks all over the lettuce. Upon further inspection I just noticed there was a BUG on the lettuce! I almost would have ate it if I had not been examining it. I was so disgusted that I almost ate this bug. I told the waitress I wanted fries instead since my salad had bugs in it! So she brought the fries and notified the manager. Manager apologized and said they threw the salad out and if we wanted anything else. We said we'd have a dessert that was on the house for the mishap and she also took $10 off the bill. It was a nice gesture but still it sucks that their food quality was so poor that they would serve not fresh food, I'm just glad I didn't eat it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brentwood,2.16,2.48,2.168,,2.3520000000000003
2,Mark H.,"Castro Valley, CA",1,28,39.0,1.0,2017-12-13,"I usually go somewhere at least a couple of times before I leave a review. We've tried this place a few times & they just don't have it. From the slow service, DIRTY menus & dirty flatware (IF you get them before your meal & don't have to get them yourself like we've had to, TWICE). To my meal coming out wrong a couple times and the super long wait, to the point I don't eat because my wife & children are done & waiting. Last week the Fryer was out French fries available), but NO ONE says anything until you are about to order (after the 20+ min wait to be seated). The Manager says there's a sign on the door (small printout that was blocked by WAITING patrons). The TWO young ladies who were hostesses didn't say a word when taking our name OR while seating us (without flatware & napkins). We still order & wait & wait, then our food is cool AGAIN. After the usual oh, ""I'm sooo sorry"" & a long wait, my wife ate her burger, but I like mine hot & I did NOT eat dinner. AGAIN. Just go anywhere else & save the hastle of the ""Red Robin Lottery"".

The only reason I might come back here is because they are open late.

Finally flagged a person to see if it was ours, that it had been sitting for sometime. She went to the window, put the back of her hand on it to check the (lack of heat) 2 other servers then proceeded to do the same before sending one back...nice..

So much for that.  Had to wait to eat until after my appointment.  We had an empty soda glass and an empty beer bottle at the edge of the table, and our waiter walked passed it time and time again.    There were maybe 5 other tables occupied when we came in....there was no reason to wait 40 minutes for a BLT and a salad.   When I asked the waiter for a status on our order I was told it would be out when it was ready.  Not really the answer I was looking for.  So we paid for our drinks and left....and won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brentwood,2.04,2.44,2.152,,2.2800000000000002

I asked for her recommendations on both my drink and my sandwich. The Zombie cocktail tasted like it was made with a mix, and it wasn't very good, but Jasmine was nice enough to replace it. My Bruschetta Chicken sandwich and my husband's burger were yummy, but like previous visits, both of our fries were just lukewarm.
