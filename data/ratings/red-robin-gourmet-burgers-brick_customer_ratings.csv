27,Anthony C.,"Brick, NJ",0,4,3.0,4.0,2015-02-10,"After previously eating at the Red Robin location in South Plainfield multiple times, I do like the way they arranged everything at this local location. Appetizers: onion stack, pretzel bites with beer cheese are both  a great way to start your beginning eats. Burgers, too, where awesome. Although, the only complaint (1 star loss) was the queso dip--it came out room temperature, which, for a cheese dip should be warm if not hot. Overall, great burger spot around the brick/toms river area.  P.S. if you are a Bacon connoisseur, you must try the Bacon 'aoili' dip. It is delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brick?start=20,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.736
25,Angel W.,"Philadelphia, PA",131,93,3.0,2.0,2015-02-15,"I will say our waitress was good. I don't remember her name, but she was pulling a double and on the second half of it and she was still going strong. Give her a raise. Other than that, this place still has a lot of kinks to work out. I was in a party of two and there was a 5 - 10 minute wait. They never took my name, just ""party of two"". This proved problematic seeing as everyone that was a party of two who came in after us thought it was their turn to be seated. Needless to say, FOUR parties of two that came in after us were seated prior to us. One couple was seated immediately after we'd been waiting 20 minutes. Finally a girl came to seat us and then had to take us back to the lobby because the table hadn't been cleared. While waiting for her, yet another party of two that came in after was seated. After another 5 minutes or so, we were about to leave, but the lady finally came back for us.  Food was mediocre at best. Had to ask for utensils. At least the margarita was good. Won't be going back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brick?start=20,2.568,2.568,2.568,2.568,2.5680000000000005
51,Brian Q.,"Point Pleasant Beach, NJ",1,26,,2.0,2015-02-16,"Ha,  a place that specializes in burgers and you can only order them two ways: #1 ""little bit of pink"" or  #2 ""no pink"".  Now I understand why these chains have avoided the northeast for so long.  I ordered the ""little bit of pink"" and there was no pink at all.  Now for me, I can eat burgers medium rare through medium well but I can imagine how disappointed people will be who must have medium rare or medium burgers.  The burger itself was quality meat, but it's well done so it loses most of the flavor.  The burgers are very expensive which is another drawback especially since you can't get it cooked medium or less.  We sat at the bar which is very small and the beer selections are typical and boring.  Two burgers and three craft beers came to $50, $60 after tip.  The service was fine.  This is a place you come to once just to satisfy your curiosity.  Especially, since five guys and smash burger are both right there in the area and offer superior burgers for $4 less per burger.   Sing it with me....""Red Robin.......buuummmmm (er)"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brick?start=40,2.6000000000000005,2.6000000000000005,2.6000000000000005,2.6000000000000005,2.6000000000000005

76,Rob M.,"Brick, NJ",5,86,32.0,4.0,2015-02-22,"This review comes after our second visit to this location. We have been to Red Robin before elsewhere. I didn't post a review after the first visit because our experience was pretty bad and I wanted to give them another chance. I understood it was their first week open so I figured they had to work out the kinks. Well, after our second visit I'm still not overly impressed with this location. I'm trying hard to be patient with them because we really like their food at the other Red Robins. I'm hoping they eventually catch up to the experiences we have had before. The food wasn't bad but not great. I don't mind some salt but everything here comes loaded with salt. We got the onion rings and boneless wings as an appetizer. The kids got chicken fingers and a corn dog. My wife and I each had burgers. This visit other than the excessive salt, the food wasn't bad. The main issue this time was service. The server kept forgetting things and just had the attitude that she was always doing you a big favor when she came to the table. I just haven't been ""in love"" with this spot. I really hope they come around. I'm giving them four stars only because I pray they start getting their act together.

67,Ed M.,"Toms River, NJ",0,6,,4.0,2015-03-04,"Having previously tried and enjoyed Red Robin in other locations, I was excited to find out one was being built within a short ride from home. Our party of four was looking forward to checking this one out, and though they weren't perfect, it was a good experience and we all agreed we would return there in the future. We arrived at about 5:30 and the restaurant was pretty crowded, but we didn't have to wait to be seated, as they had a table for 4 by the bar. By 6pm, our waiter informed us we had gotten there just in time, as the wait time was now 35 minutes. I'm sure the wait times will die down a bit once the novelty of a new restaurant passes, and they probably won't keep as many servers on staff as they seem to have now.  Red Robin is best known for having a variety of ""gourmet"" burgers, but they do have other types of sandwiches (fish, chicken), soups, salads, and even a few full meals. They have an appetizer menu that is broken down by price - $3, $5, $7, and $9 options. The most intriguing one seems to be the $9 ""towering onion rings"" which they seemed to be selling a lot of when we were there. We chose to go with the $5 order of tortilla chips, seasoned with sea salt and served with guacamole and salsa. The chips were tasty enough to be eaten plain. The salsa was decent. I didn't try the guac, but my friends said it was good.  I ordered the ""Burnin' Love"" burger, which is topped with jalapeno-jack cheese, salsa, fried jalapeno slices, lettuce, tomato, and chipotle aioli, and served on a jalapeno-cornmeal bun. A lightly roasted whole jalapeno pepper was fixed to the top of it with a toothpick. Our server, a pleasant and sociable guy named John, dared me to eat the pepper in one bite. I told him I'd do it if he took my meal off the tab. He couldn't, so I didn't. The burger could have been a bit warmer, but it was nicely cooked, and was thick and juicy. One of Red Robin's trademarks is that they offer ""endless fries"" with the gourmet burgers. These aren't wimpy little stick fries like at Smashburger; they are thick steak fries. I ordered mine regular, but my friend got the parmesan-herb fries, which were excellent. We were expecting them to be really slow bringing out additional servings of fries, but they came out surprisingly quickly and our server did nothing to dissuade us from asking for more.  Red Robin has a full bar, but I can't comment on the drinks, as we pretty much stuck with iced tea and Cokes. One of our party also ordered some kind of shake and said it was delicious.  The wait staff were all nice, and there were plenty of them. There were also at least 3 or 4 hostesses on duty, and a manager came to our table to check on us during the meal. Just watching them all as they went back and forth past our table, it seemed like they may have been a bit disorganized, but this should get better as the employees all learn the Red Robin way of doing things at this new location. Our party's experience was unanimously positive, and we all agreed Red Robin is much better than their sad little neighbor around the corner, Smashburger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brick?start=60,2.768,2.768,2.768,2.768,2.768
30,Stacey F.,"Brick, NJ",24,97,23.0,5.0,2015-03-05,"Best Red Robin I have been to. I've been to quite a few on the east coast. Maybe they have the advantage of being new! I've been here a handful of times since they opened a few weeks ago.  99% of the staff is very nice and accommodating. There has been one waitress who was less than friendly, but I shake it off due to the newness and the usual crazy-busy state of the just-opened business.  The food is great - some choices seem a bit bizarre (tavern fries are weird), but generally you know what's coming. I love the Royal Red Robin burger. It's nice that they have easy substitutions options. If you don't want bottomless fries, you can get bottomless broccoli!

29,Kelli D.,"Manchester Township, NJ",1,105,2.0,3.0,2015-03-09,"Still a decent to okay burger chain but it's right next to burger city with  Smashburger, BWW, and Quaker Steak & Lube and not even far away from Applebees, Fridays, and Five Guys so if you want a burger you have thousands of options now even though the burger overload will make everything seem meh. The upper hand this place has over Smashburger is that it serves drinks and is a good place to spend a weekend watching the game. Also the fries are a lot better here than next door. Lots of decent and fun options for burgers here but when it comes to taste and quality my vote still goes to Five Guys.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brick?start=20,2.476,2.476,2.476,2.476,2.476
43,Matt G.,"Brick Township, NJ",66,258,3.0,2.0,2015-03-09,"I might never understand the ""Burgermania"" that seems to be sweeping the area lately, with chains like Smashburger, Five Guys, Burger 25, Cheeburger, and a million others that seem to think the lowly hamburger - an item that used to cost five bucks at any diner, should suddenly become a ""gourmet"" item.  That said, you'd have to be disconnected from the TV / radio entirely to have never heard of Red Robin. In case you're one of those people, Red Robin is (you guessed it), another burger restaurant, specializing in ""gourmet"" hamburgers, shakes, and endless french fries.  The menu is pretty expansive, and no matter what you're in the mood for, they probably have a burger for it, be it spicy, savory, sweet, or even one with an egg on top, which actually tastes pretty good.  A leg up that this place has over ""fast casual"" chains like Five Guys and the (in my opinion, awful) Smashburger, is that you can get a beer with your meal.  While the tap list isn't exactly anything special, and mostly consists of AB Inbev macrobrew stuff like Budweiser and ""macro-craft"" breweries, it's still nice to have the option.  Decor for the place?  Ehh, it's pretty much your typical kitschy chain restaurant akin to TGI Fridays, with knick-knacks and posters all over the walls and ceilings.  A little more tastefully done, perhaps. Speaking of taste - on to the important thing, the food.  RR only cooks burgers two ways, apparently.  You can either get ""a little bit of pink"", or ""no pink"".  I've tried getting it as rare as possible by practically begging, and of the 3 times I've been here, the burgers have always come out hockey puck'ed, aka, well done / ""no pink"".  If you're going to ask me how I want it, could you at least *try* not to grill the thing until it's burnt?  Most of the juices were gone at that point, kinda sad, since the burgers themselves are of decent quality, and flavor is pretty good.  The topping combinations all work pretty well, and the fries are pretty great, especially when combined with one of their dipping sauces (I'm a fan of campfire).  Prices are the upper end of average, and most burgers are ~$8 to $12. As other people have said, this place still has a bunch of kinks to work out.  Service is friendly, but has been pretty spotty.  Waitstaff seem to be either overworked, mismanaged, or understaffed, since they're constantly buzzing around from table to table.  Food sometimes comes out quickly, other times it's an eternity, and while they haven't really ever screwed up my order, there has been a few times where they forgot to bring a sauce, and my burgers have *always* come out well done, no matter how I ordered it.  Hopefully they work these things out, since the food here is better than anything you'll get at Five Guys, and *WAY* better than the SmashBurger that's next door. 3/26/15 *Quick edit, dropping a star since they've only gotten worse. An HOUR for a hamburger on a Wed night, and burnt AGAIN?  Gonna be a long time before I go back.  Staff is nice, but the kitchen is incompetent.*",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brick?start=40,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003

When I asked why there cooks were not wearing hats hair nets and beard guards. Just looked confused. Ohh hats parents OK.

78,D C.,"Jersey City, NJ",35,111,9.0,1.0,2015-03-23,"So I have been to several Red Robin's and this is the worst overall. I went there friday around 10pm, which is a hour before they close. I sat at the bar where there was only 3 other customers that were eating. There was 2 bartenders at the bar talking to the other customers and among themselves. I sat there thinking if they do not notice me within 5 minutes I was going to leave. Just as I looked at my phone and realized 5 minutes has passed and I was about to leave, the bartender approaches me and asked what I would like. So I decided to give it a try, BAD MISTAKE. I ordered the Fiery Ghost Tavern Burger which he did not ask me how I wanted it cooked. I also ordered a Jack and Coke, which was the weakest and worst Jack and Coke I have ever had. Should have just been called a $6 Coke. I also ordered a Coke afterwards, and for the first time I was charged for a soft drink after having a alcoholic beverage. While I was drinking my Coke, The bartender Andrew was cleaning something for the milkshake and it exploded on me, and got all over the left side of my shirt. All he kept saying is that never happened before, but nobody wanted to compensate me for what just happened. He later asked if I wanted to speak to the manager, I said yes. The manager comes over and  offers to reimburse me if I get my shirt dry cleaned. This was terrible customer service, and having the same type of service come from the manager shows this location is not customer service orientated.

63,N D.,"Beachwood, NJ",0,24,,5.0,2015-04-08,"I'm a tough customer when it comes to restaurants. Growing up around good quality dives and chains I tend to have higher standards than many of my dinning companions here on the Jersey Shore (see my other reviews). So, when I see reviewers say that Red Robin is located next to Smashburger, BWW, or AppleBee's and that makes too much competition for them...I laugh.  I've been to Red Robin three times since they've opened, with three different groups of people, for three different types of outings. I went there with co-workers as an after work group get-together. I went with my kids as an after movie lunch, and I went with my husband on date night. Not once did anyone have left-overs to take home or even have food left on their plate. My co-workers think BWW is the bomb (gross), my son think's AppleBee's is awesome (also gross), and it's not uncommon for me to make separate meals for my husband because we don't like the same food. So, to get such a diverse group of people ranging from 15-47 years old to enjoy the same place is a score. And everyone enjoyed it! All three times our food was cooked to order and everyone liked their meal. They have free refills on fries (though I would ask for them to not season them or season them lightly - it doesn't take much for them to be heavy handed with the fry seasoning and there's a bottle on the table so you can always season them yourselves). And free refills on many of the drinks. Their shakes were good, their cocktails reasonably priced, and their meal selection is huge. No one had a complaint and ALL my daughter does is complain - especially at restaurants.  The staff is always friendly - the only downside is that there is often a wait of 45 min. The place gets packed - which should be an indicator of how good it is given that as previous reviewers have mentioned, Red Robin is situated next to a Quaker Steak, Smashburger, Atlanta Bread, Joe's Crab Shack, Outback, AppleBee's and BWW...there are no shortages of places to eat in that parking lot or the adjoining parking lot. With that many places to chose from if the food wasn't that good people wouldn't wait. Especially since many of them are similarly priced and sell burgers and drinks.

44,Neal C.,"Brick Township, NJ",10,43,1.0,1.0,2015-04-10,"This Red Robin has managed to disappoint me in a way I'm not used to. I expect a chain restaurant to have middling-to-good food, reasonably good service, and fair prices. Red Robin in Brick has good food made consistently wrong, friendly staff but not enough of them, and surprisingly high prices for a simple food. I've been to this location four times. Not once has my burger been cooked correctly. Now, I understand they won't do anything below medium. They don't even call it medium - they call it ""some pink."" If you're going to call it ""some pink,"" there should be some pink. I have yet to see pink. To be fair, everything else about the burgers have been fine. They taste good. They're served as advertised. But, c'mon. If burgers are your specialty, and you've been doing burgers for 40 years, you should be able to get ""some pink"" right at least 1 in 4 times. As for the service, the last time I was here it took an hour from when I was seated, until I had my burger. I know it was an hour because I was texting someone in the lobby as I waited, so I could see when I sent my last text. It took 20 minutes before anyone even took our order, and another 40 minutes until our burgers arrived. It shouldn't take an hour to go from Seated to Burgers when the restaurant isn't even half full. The problem isn't the waitstaff, though. In fact our water was awesome. It's management. The restaurant is severely understaffed. I know this not only because it's plain to see, but because the manager on duty also explained to us what was going on when we complained. Get your act together, Red Robin. You have over 500 locations, and you've been in business for over 40 years. I know you know how to staff a restaurant. What are you doing in Brick? It's going to be a few months before I bother going back. I really can't think of a reason to go. The burgers are good, but not worth waiting an hour for.

Aside from the slight mess up with the apps, the service was good and the waitress was very sweet.  Everyone we dealt with on the staff was pleasant in fact.

77,Rachel D.,"Brick, NJ",0,6,,2.0,2015-06-23,"I normally take reviews with a grain of salt. The reviews for Red Robin in Brick, however, were spot on.  My husband and I went there for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon. There were a few other customers, I'd say it was about 1/4 full.  We were seated immediately, the hostess was efficient and courteous. No problems there. Our waitress arrived a couple of minutes later at our table for our drink order. Hubby had an iced tea, I had a margarita on the rocks and a glass of water. The margarita was sub-par, clearly not shaken enough before it was poured into the glass (it was slightly warm) and made with what tasted like a cheap mix.  After placing our food order (a whiskey river bbq burger and a royal red robin), we waited. And waited. And waited. I had a clear view of the kitchen and saw 2 dishes sitting in the window for at least 15 minutes. I could tell it wasn't our food, but obviously someone else was waiting for their food for a long time too! Meanwhile, our waitress didn't stop by once to ask if we needed anything else.  Finally, our food arrived. There was nothing ""gourmet"" about either burger. The egg on the royal red robin was cold and the yolk caved in, like it was sitting for a long time. The bun tasted cheap, like a regular, cheap sesame bun you can buy from any supermarket or convenience store. It disintegrated under the grease. The patty was thin, not much thicker than a McDonalds patty. The bbq burger had fried onion ""straws"" (more like a pile of limp, greasy onions) that my husband couldn't even bite through, they were so tough. All of the food was slightly warm, at best. The fries weren't bad, I'll give them that. When our waitress came by to see if everything was ok and we said ""it was just ok"", she came back with dipping sauces for the fries. They weren't too bad. She clearly told her manager that we weren't satisfied. He stopped by and he was very courteous, he listened to what we had to say and was apologetic. He is the reason why we gave the place 2 stars instead of 1.  We're not going back. It's not worth it. Smashburger is next door and has better burgers.

How uncomfortable. We were moved to the regular dining area immediately. We didn't ask to sit in the bar.. Anyway, after 10 minutes we got an apology from the server for the wait, he took our burger and drink order. Ok. We ordered two well done burgers and fries. A water and a soda. Nothing special for a burger place. We were excited to try this place out! Well, the Drinks came right out but We needed some napkins, which we had none on the table. As we waited I tried to get the servers attention for a napkin. He would not look in our direction. It was almost comical. I tried to get anyone else's attention too. No one would look at me! So I gave up. For 45 more minutes this went on!! We sat and sat and sat- the server NEVER checked on us or came back to explain the long wait. NOTHING. People in another section across the room ( who were seated after us) got appetizers, burgers, desserts., and were replaced with new customers who got appetizers.. WE WERE STILL NAPKINLESS AND FOODLESS !!  Just as we were about to stand up and just leave , the food arrives. Now We can't start on it because we had no silverware to eat with! ( must be with the napkins!!) The waiter sighed annoyedly to have to get us silverware and then proceeded to serve someone else why we sat waiting AGAIN. We were LIVID  now.

Expecting more problems ( and I was right) I broke open my burger with my finger to check it, and it was RAW MEAT inside!! Not well-done. That was the last straw! When the napkins and silverware finally arrived we were already standing up and leaving. The server didn't seemed surprised and just WALKED AWAY. As if it was common to see!!!! We stopped and told the seater at the podium of our rotten experience and she just said -""do you want a manager?? ""My husband said ""what will he do at this point ?"" She said she didn't know.

It was just  myself and our two kids this visit, and we had no wait and were seated quickly. It took a little while for our server to come by, and she made no mention of the little iPad looking thing on the table-which was new for me, even though I've been to RR before. Eventually we figured it out after she put our drink orders in. The food came out quickly enough, but our pretzel bites were very overcooked. They looked almost like they were chocolate covered and it was clear they had been in the fryer too long. They still tasted alright, and my kids and I just over dipped them in the beer cheese. (As if you could ever over dip something...) I would have ordered the Uberburger, which was a special, but I was shocked at the sticker price! $14 for a burger? Totally outrageous. The bigger issue was not the price, but the fact that you can't even order the burger how you want it cooked. I get what they are trying to do-making it their ""own"" by saying ""some pink or no pink"" but I wound up ordering the Nacho Burger and was told my the waitress my only option was medium well. That was disappointing. When the food came out, my kids were super happy with their meals. The fries looked perfectly cooked, and the burgers were great, albeit small portions for what we paid. Mine tasted fine, and was a good size, but once again, my sweet potato fries were burned. You get an option to leave feedback when you check out-which happens to be at the table. (I liked that part a lot, although being that I saw our waitress about 5 seconds the whole visit, I didn't feel great about the automatic move to a 20% tip..but, I left it anyway.) and I did leave my feedback so they knew that some of our food was overcooked.

36,Brandon M.,"Brick, NJ",77,48,26.0,3.0,2016-01-08,This location is great for a quick meal and a nice cold beer. The service is a little hit or miss when it comes to accuracy and speed. The table ordering system is convenient for ordering appetizers and other items. This system is not good if you need to call your server though. During my last visit I waited a total of 20 minutes for the appetizer to reach the table and the place was completely empty. The server told us that she was in the back office taking care of something and told us a partial life story. She was apologetic which helped to make the visit better. In this case someone should've known to run her food orders which had been sitting in the window for far too long before they reached our table. This place was great when it opened but the overall service seems to have decreased greatly. Hopefully this location improves so I can continue to enjoy my visits here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brick?start=20,2.76,2.76,2.76,2.636,2.76

26,Laura A.,"Fort Drum, NY",52,49,2.0,2.0,2016-07-09,"I should have listened to the bad reviews. Starting from the beginning, half of our table couldn't hear the waitress bc she basically whispered, she then forgot drinks and straws. The kids meals came out first like we asked but were cold, frigid almost. My husband ordered the chili burger that boasted a heaping pile of their famous chili. It was pathetic. One spoonful of dry, crusty, canned chili. He said it tasted canned. My meal however, never came. When it finally did it was the only decent temperatured one. I got the royal burger (it had an egg and some fancy sauce). It was delicious until about halfway through when it tasted like a shoe. I looked at my burger and it was burnt. I've eaten burnt before but this tasted even weirder, maybe like the grill cleaner? Idk. I tried to keep going bc I was hungry but I just couldn't do it. We then went to the restroom to change my son. I felt awful bc as soon as his diaper came off he peed and soaked the changing table. There weren't any paper towels (I get it , eco friendly) but I couldn't find any toilet paper either. I ended up using ALL of the changing table covers. When I went into the stall the door ""locked"" but kept flying open. So all in all the whole experience sucked.

First things first they seem to upsell you without actually telling you there are extra charges. It has happened several times now. In addition there payment system is absolutely ridiculous. You can split the check only if it's 2 cards or 2 people paying cash. You apparently are unable to do a cash and card combination when splitting a check. Even the manager had to come over to let us know they couldn't figure it out. The food is ok but honestly there are so many better run burger joints in the area with similar or better quality that I would much rather take my business there.

7,Mark C.,"Toms River, NJ",55,108,254.0,4.0,2016-11-21,"I've eaten at a Red Robin only once before, and had a pretty bad experience. I thought that five years was enough time to give this company another chance, and I'm gad I did.  I was really in the mood for a burger, but didn't want to waste my money on the nearby Smashburger.  After perusing the menu for a few minutes, I settled on their burger with the fried egg on top (the secret ingredient that can elevate a burger to levels of transcendence when done properly) and upgraded my fries to the garlic Parmesan for an extra buck.  I also had a Barq's root beer float to wash it all down. The whole meal was perfect.  The garlic fries were so freaking good! and the fact that they offer complimentary refills made the upgrade totally worth it. The burger itself looked amazing, as you can see in the attached picture. That egg was perfectly runny, and the burger was seasoned well, juicy, and just so tasty.  This was honestly the best burger I've had in months, and I really did not expect it from such an unassuming burger joint.  I will definitely be back to chase that perfect burger again, and will definitely splurge on that garlic Parmesan upgrade on the fries.  As a side note, the little table-top tablet thing that you can use to pay for your bill also offers some games, but be warned that they charge you to play! Make sure you read the terms and conditions before you agree to a silly charge just because you were playing around with that thing.

I'm a tough critic for the most part, and sure this restaurant isn't perfect, but for what you pay and what you get, I have to give them 4 stars. I've been to this location a few times since they've opened, but not regularly. Frankly, the steak fries they offer aren't my cup of tea. But the burgers are always good. Sure they don't cook it ""rare, medium, or well"" as you ask but you either get it pink or not pink. I don't know any restaurants in this area that actually cook a burger how you want even if they ask you how you want it. Here at least they're honest and you get it either pink or no pink.  Anyway, the latest trip here we ordered the Red Robin gourmet burger, a bacon cheeseburger, and a smoke and pepper burger (I think) and nachos. Everything was tasty and satisfying, still warm and crispy (fries). And we had it TO GO!   I did order a raspberry iced tea though and it tasted like a bag of syrup but it wasn't a deal breaker.  I do usually get the burger with the egg on it but didn't this time. The gourmet cheeseburger was the best burger around (yes, even compared to smashburger right next door which I think is totally overrated).  Anyway, if you like burgers, definitely try this place. I don't understand why people are so angry in the the reviews. Also, they serve alcohol.

We waited about 10 minutes to get a table.....in an almost empty restaurant. It was weird. But we were seated and our waitress was awesome. They have burgers starting at 7 bucks, which is a bit of a scam because the waitress said they are kid sized. So that 7 dollar burger becomes 9 dollars when you get the ""Big"", adult size. Also, it was supposed to be a double burger but they must have forgotten the second patty because there was only one....on each of our burgers. It was our first time there so we didn't realize it until after we left and were on our way to the show. Oh, how we laughed.... The best part of the meal was bottomless fries. The fries were good....but we had to stay on top of them to honor that bottomless claim. Bottomless fries should never run empty. Ever. Yummmmm. You can get a burger from 7 bucks on up and the food was pretty good in all fairness though it would have been nice to get 2 patties on our doubles. Lets chock that up to a new cook in the kitchen. The place was clean and the service on point. Even the bathrooms were clean. So if you're hungry and want a decent burger, swing on by. Its not a big, juicy burger like you'd get in a regular burger joint or steak house, but it isn't bad.
