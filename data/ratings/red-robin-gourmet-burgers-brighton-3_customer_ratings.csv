28,Karen A.,"Brighton, CO",0,32,,5.0,2017-07-05,We had a reservation for their training schedule. The meal was delicious... the best salad I think I've ever had ....their brand new Southwestern sombrero! Our server Beatrice was excellent. Great during training looking forward to when they really open for business.

We went on opening day and you would never know it was day one. Well done to the NRO team and getting a staff trained and engaged from the get go.

8,Genesa L.,"Bennett, CO",221,16,13.0,4.0,2017-07-14,"I wanted to start off saying...The only reason I didn't give them five stars is because corporate changed their french fries & they are no longer safe for those with milk allergies! Including the sweet potato fries which my littlest and I are looking forward to. But that's a first world problem  Daniel our server was absolutely amazing! He did everything he could to make sure my daughter and I were safe from allergens, even sending over the manager Scott to help us confirm!  I had a lettuce wrap turkey burger with coleslaw all gluten, wheat and dairy free! My littlest enjoyed a kids burger no cheese and steamed broccoli. We are happy to have someone in the area at that cares about our families as much as we do!

This place had a bunch of hiccups like most new  restaurants... For a Thursday night it was packed actually had a 30 min wait... The wait staff seemed confused on what food went were...

I understand this is a new location but it's very stupid to not be ready.

IF YOU WANT AMAZING SERVICE AND FOOD GO DOWN THE STREET TO OLD CHICAGO.      Service here is horrible.  Whoever received  good service must of been lucky.. I must update. I spoke with Kerrie, I guess that's how you spell it. He did take care of us after 1 1/2 hours of standing in their store waiting for a togo order. I really do appreciate his help, but It's going to take more than this to win us back.. It always seems like like Rd Robin is a cluster of a mess.. This is sad, we looked so forward to this plase opening.. Our Saturday night is down the tubes.  ( we will give RRGB another chance) But lord have mercy!

15,Christopher G.,"Bellevue, WA",7,5,1.0,1.0,2017-08-08,"Red Robin is by far my favorite goto burger place. Unfortunately this location I will not darken the door step again. Maybe Some staff training is needed? Two small groups ahead of us waiting. We had a party of 8 and where told to goto Buffalo Wild Wings less of a wait and better food. Thank you to the male host on Tuesday aug 8th evening.

2,Tristan T.,"Brighton, CO",0,37,4.0,2.0,2017-08-11,"You know I hate having to come to Yelp to post a poor review - I'd much rather tell the Yelp community about my good experiences.  Ok now that's been said ...... I absolutely Do Not understand how in this day and age, (especially at a franchise restaurant) what excuse there is for absolutely poor service.  The sheer lack of attentiveness from our waitress was upsetting - it's a pretty straightforward job. Take orders (drinks, food, etc...) bring them in a timely fashion and and touch the table from time to time to see if your customers need, napkins, drink refills - the check!!!  All around bad experience for my first time at a Red Robin.  The burger I had was pretty good but the ""bottomless"" fries were soggy, a very small order, and getting additional soggy depressing fries took 15 mins at a minimum.  Do yourself a favor and choose Some place else!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brighton-3,,,,,
26,ChesterandAngel C.,"Denver, CO",24,1,2.0,1.0,2017-08-19,"If I could give them 0 stars......This was the very worst service I have EVER received from any restaurant. I ordered a to-go meal for my husband and I after a long hard day of work and driving through ridiculous traffic to Red Robin.   While on the phone placing the order, I could barely hear the lady taking the order.  I asked her to repeat my order and she got an attitude.   Finally by the third time of repeating my order it sounded right. Once I got there I went to the to-go area to pick up my order and the lady assisting me seemed very nice.   She gave me a water cup and some fries as I waited.  I could see and hear the manager talking loudly about the customer ratings which were around 40% ...seemed very unprofessional... The hostess returned with a bag that had all three containers.   I asked her if I should check it and she was extremely confident by saying,  ""I know it's right because I just checked it for you!""  I took her word for it and drove home.  This was the first time I ever did this and the last....Once I got to my house ... in disbelief...I opened the container with our appetizer aka the ""wedge salad"" and to my surprise...there was just a chunk of dried up lettuce with one piece of bacon and a couple of onion rings around the wedge.  It looked disgusting and nothing like the picture!  Our sweet potato fries were ice cold and didn't taste like they had even been baked.  The wedgie burgers were burnt and were drowned in watery guacamole sauce.  It wasn't good to say the least... it was horrible and I was extremely disappointed because we had just ate there a week prior and everything was good.    This place is very inconsistent which is sad because they just opened.   I called and spoke to the manager on duty.   He was extremely apologetic and offered to refund my order and send a gift card via email.    Do you think he sent that email..?  NO! No he didn't and I am not even sure he refunded my money.   I felt played by this restaurant ... Now I have to see if my money gets refunded.   If it doesn't... you will be hearing from me again.  I posted my picture of the wedge salad.  You can't miss it because it looks sad....real sad like your service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brighton-3?start=20,,,,,
13,Jenny H.,"Harrisburg, SD",9,2,,1.0,2017-08-30,"Wait to eat here for a year ... the staff is horrible, slow you have to wait forever for a basket of fries. They roam around doing nothing . Three times we have gave this store a chance and a epic fail!!! Now for us to have Red Robin we have to drive 30 miles to get decent service. Hands down the worst I have been to ever !!!! Get it together ppl it takes 2 mins to make s basket of fries . Don't bother eating here no point complaining to management nothing will be done .

16,Cory M.,"Wichita, KS",6,13,10.0,2.0,2017-09-06,"Service was very very slow.  The bottomless fries were so cold, old, and soggy.  No wonder they're bottomless, you seriously cannot eat more than three fries and you will wait forever for the exact same thing!  How is this possible?  Burgers were well below average, maybe just a slight bit better than McDonalds!  I just don't understand how their signature item is below average, fries were awful, and the service was slow and inattentive.    Oh yeah and this visit was on a Monday at 2pm?  Nobody even there but my wife and I, maybe 5 other tables.  I understand why.  Go to McDonald's, at least maybe their ice cream machine will be working.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brighton-3,,,,,
10,Joe T.,"Longmont, CO",0,4,,1.0,2017-09-16,"Seems they are still getting their legs underneath them.  Friday night visit.  Started with drink order but it took two reminders over twenty minutes before a couple beers were delivered... unfortunately not until after the food was served.  Ordered burger Med Well but it was prepared rare.  Accompanying fries were soggy and cold. When pointed out to staff, they were very apologetic and offered to replace the uneaten meal with another.  I declined and just had them return the food to the kitchen for disposal.  The punch line was finding a charge for my uneaten meal on the check.  Probably best to give them a few months to get their customer service model in shape before returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brighton-3,,,,,
9,Tim W.,"Brighton, CO",10,10,14.0,5.0,2017-09-18,I'm giving this 5 Stars due solely to the exemplary service I have received at the bar!   Tiffany and Tiffany are great!   I came here on a busy night and they were super friendly and genuine    Added update -----   I love this Red Robin.  Every time I come here I'm always greeted with a smile and a friendly smile.    Staff here is wonderful and always seem to be working hard but not too hard where they stop being friendly.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brighton-3,,,,,
25,Sherrie W.,"Commerce City, CO",0,11,,4.0,2017-09-20,This is the first time eating at a Red Robin.  The food was very good-the best veggie burger I've had in a long time.  The service however was poor.  Our server was trying really hard and kept apologizing to every table he had.  It took way too long to receive our beers and eventually our food.  I know its not the servers fault and felt bad for the guy.  I'm rating this experience 4 stars for the food.  The length of time to receive the food would be 1 star.  I will definitely eat at Red Robin again but maybe not this location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brighton-3?start=20,,,,,

1,Rob G.,"Henderson, CO",118,19,,1.0,2017-10-04,"I know, I know, it's Red Robin, right? What was I expecting? I had a gift card. This is a new Red Robin. The servers were very friendly, pleasant, and attentive, hence the star.  I got a burger and the plate looked dirty. I pointed it out to the server and she said it was clean and the smudges were just from the cooks handling the plates to put the food on them.  Ok? The fries were ok. It's hard to mess them up. I got a burger and it was bad. It didn't taste fresh and I didn't finish it. I gave the server a good tip, but I'll never go back. If I get a Red Robin gift card, I'm not sure what I'll do.

7,Brittany M.,"Brighton, CO",0,13,3.0,3.0,2017-11-12,"I love the food, but the service isn't so good. Our waiter was rude and took forever to refill our drinks and didn't bring our our bottomless fries to start. I think I'd personally use that as a free perk I have to offer. Free fries make people happy right?  When we asked the waiter for some French fries to start about 20 minutes into our visit he said I'd of brought them earlier, but you didn't ask. He brought them to the table right beside us to start after they sat down AFTER us, no questions asked and he refilled their drinks just the same. He took forever to refill ours and I was even trying to be patient. I'm not so sure we will be back. The customer service is lacking and really needs work.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brighton-3,,,,,

Me, my boyfriend, and my family recently visited this Red Robin, I understand the struggles of just opening as I worked in a restaurant in the area, however this was an awful experience. Our waiter came, got our order, and we didn't see him for well over 40 minutes. I asked for some pink and my burger was burnt, it was so dry I couldn't eat it, but couldn't send it back either due to never being checked on.
