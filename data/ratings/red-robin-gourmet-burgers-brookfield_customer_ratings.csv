56,Amy P.,"Milwaukee, WI",4,90,11.0,4.0,2012-01-27,Red Robin was a little better than i expected.  I went for lunch with my 4 yr. old around 11:30.  We were able to get a table right away and our server was very attentive.  I wanted something healthy so i ordered the Southwest Grilled Chicken Salad.  Very good!  I should have asked to hold the deep fried peppers.  I did sample one and it was yummy.  My son ordered the mac & cheese. He was happy with the order.  I like the number of options with the kids meal along with the crayons & coloring page to keep them occupied.  I will return if i'd like something a little more than fast food when i'm at the mall.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brookfield?start=40,2.9920000000000004,2.9920000000000004,2.9920000000000004,2.9920000000000004,2.992000000000001

We didn't have to wait very long (maybe 10-15 mins) which is not bad at all for a Friday night. The service was fantastic. The food was definitely good and the prices were reasonable.

My Milwaukee work colleagues and I all got together here for dinner before a work event.  They do not take reservations, but were extremely accommodating and was able to seat our party of 8 right away.  Service was awesome - - we even had a birthday boy in the group. (So we heard the joyous group of Red Robin server singers...)  :) I think I always get a burger at Red Robin -- and my tip would be, that you can always ask for a Petite burger. I think technically it's a $1 less but the patty is smaller. :) Easy location to find, just outside the mall. Parking was a little busy, due to mall traffic - - but in Brookfield, this is a decent/casual place to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brookfield?start=20,2.9920000000000004,2.9920000000000004,2.9920000000000004,2.9920000000000004,2.992000000000001

Okay now that we got that outta the way.  Yes, it was kind of Yummmm but I don't think I would go outta my way for a Red Robin burger in the future.  However, the server did intrigue me when she was talking about how good the Veggie Burger was.  I love Veggie Burgers and if it is a made-in-house veggie burger, then I usually fall in love.   This time I was craving the real burger though and that's what I got.  I got a regular cheese burger and added fried onion rings.  I was starving so I probably gobbled it way too fast however it didn't have tons of flavor that a burger really should have.  The bun was also really dry!  MINUS--I wasn't going to send it back for the bun though--I was way to hungry for that business! My husband got the sweet potato fries in lieu of the streak fries and I think I would make that choice next time.  I wasn't too crazy about the steak fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brookfield?start=40,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004

Next after we were seated it took an additional 10 mins. before the waiter came and asked for our drink order.........then we waited over 10 more mins. waiting for the drinks. He never did come back to take our food order, we had to flag him down. He was also taking care of 2 other booths and a party table of 20. He was definitely catering to this larger group which was very obvious. After we ordered it took 20 mins. to get our food. Mind you, we're with our 2 granddaughters (8 & 7 yrs. old). They did great until we had to wait that long for our food. The food was ok, I had the tortilla soup which was god awful and 3.99 for a bowl of it???? The burgers were very good and the fries were outstanding, nice and hot & crispy. The kids food from the childrens menu was awful and WAY overpriced for a kids meal. I tasted the mac 'n cheese one of them ordered and I had to agree with my granddaughter that it was not very good. It was like a bowl of soup. Anyway, I won't be returning to Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brookfield?start=60,2.9200000000000004,2.9200000000000004,2.9200000000000004,2.9200000000000004,2.9200000000000004

46,Melissa F.,"Milwaukee, WI",7,106,,4.0,2012-12-15,"Red Robin, yum indeed. Burgers are really good, fries are good (and bottomless). I like the freckled lemonade and their raspberry limeade. At our most recent experience, all the staff was excellent. Best service we've received at a chain place (especially when comparing similar places). Don't want a burger? Lots of chicken options as well. Some yummy sounded appetizers that I haven't tried yet, but don't worry, we'll be back! Parking can be a pain in the mall (if you've been to Brookfield Square, you know the structure of the lot in the front isn't the best). Not Red Robin's fault, but not fun to walk around the whole mall after a really full stomach. I also like that the only entrance is from the front of the restaurant, no mall entrance!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brookfield?start=40,3.056,3.056,3.056,3.056,3.0560000000000005
42,Joe P.,"Milwaukee, WI",96,560,94.0,3.0,2013-05-06,"Descriptive phrase: Surprisingly delicious pub-grub saturated in flair. I came to Red Robin at Brookfield Square recently with a coworker for a quick lunch. We were seated immediately by a peppy server at a tall barstool table. This place is kitschy to the max, with flair everywhere. Walls are covered with signs and photos, colors pop, and servers are always excited to serve. Our waitress was very attentive, but a little too laidback for my taste. I ordered the Whiskey River BBQ Chicken Wrap. Our meals came out quickly, which was appreciated since we were on lunch break.  I really liked my meal. The spinach tortilla straddled that fine line between crispy and doughy where wraps should be, and the ingredients were plentiful. Lettuce, tortilla strips, ranch dressing, and chicken breast drenched in a sweet and tangy bbq sauce. Highly recommended. The steak fries were bottomless, but weren't good enough in my opinion to even finish my first helping. A little too raw still for my taste; I like'm a bit crispier. A-OK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brookfield?start=40,2.9560000000000004,2.9560000000000004,2.9560000000000004,2.9560000000000004,2.9560000000000004
33,Colin A.,"Milwaukee, WI",118,320,113.0,3.0,2013-07-09,"For Milwaukeeans, there will always be better choices for grilled meat sandwiches (aka ""burgers"") than Red Robin: Sobelman's, AJ Bombers, Oscar's...you get the point. But when you're trapped in suburbia and want a burger to sate your hunger, you could also do much worse. As a chain, Red Robin has their schtick (bottomless fries, the ""Yummmm"" commercials that might drive you bonkers), and the menu rarely changes, but the service is spot-on and even if you only dine here once a year, there are enough choices for carnivores and veg-heads alike. Flavor is good, lots of ""Red Robin exclusives"" (Whiskey River BBQ, chili cheese). I tried the chili cheese burger during my last visit -- great flavor, but holy salt lake city! The sodium content was out of this state salty. Whew. The burger wasn't as sloppy as advertised, but that was OK, too. The bottomless fries are nice if you have a huge appetite, but I prefer mine to be a bit crispier. I tend to eat at Red Robin establishments when traveling for work conferences with a large group of people. Not my preference, but this is a place that can please a large group of folks and do so in a hurry. Parking is crazy here unless it's late in the evening, and the place is host to a zoo of people -- birthday parties are a big draw here -- but unless you've been shopping all day in Brookfield this probably is not your preferred location anyway. Oscar's & Sobelman's -- among others -- will always be my first choice for burgers in the 414, but again you can do much worse than the chain that is Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brookfield?start=20,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004
37,Angela G.,"Milwaukee, WI",15,63,4.0,4.0,2013-09-21,"Is it Sobelman's? No. Duh.  But when you're looking at food near a mall this is a good choice. It's unpretentious, the burgers are tasty, and it's loud so you don't have to worry about the kids making a ruckus. The staff is friendly and accommodating to kids.   I like the burger with the deep fried jalapenos and chipotle mayo. I get extra chipotle mayo for my fries. I guess it depends on how you like your fries but this is my favorite kind of fries, ever, so I really enjoy them. I always put malt vinegar and that seasoning salt on them.

53,Steven T.,"Milwaukee, WI",91,965,11803.0,3.0,2013-10-11,"It's no oscars pub but it was ok. They can't do rare at all because it was void of any red meat. I had the guacamole burger which didn't have much guacamole flavor at all so I looked and if it was there it was spread very thin and didn't look anything like the picture, why do they allways show a picture of something that never looks like what you order. The movie falling down is so true and every one should see the restraunt scene because it's true. The frys were good and plentiful. For $ 10.00 you expect better when a whopper is $ 4.00 and is just a burger too. The toppings were fresh just like BK and it was tasty but not all that. I came, I saw and I tasted but this will not be a regular stop as long as oscars pub is around. It's ok if you around one but if you go out for a burger with a burger in mind this is not the place. Would I go back for lunch ? Yes because it's close and has great variety compared to Wendy's, MD and BK. I just expected more. For me it's over priced and under the wow factor for what they claim. Now after all being said its a chain restraunt and Oscars, Soblems and Pistol Pete's is where the burger lives if you want better than average burger where rare is cooked correctly or any temp you want.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brookfield?start=40,2.8920000000000003,2.8920000000000003,2.8920000000000003,2.8920000000000003,2.892000000000001

Food is your typical burger and sandwich fare.  There are a large number of options and so everyone will find something that suits their palette.  My personal favorite is the Burnin' Love burger with jalapeño slices in it.  It is consistently good but I can't say its spectacular.

14,Damon R.,"Milwaukee, WI",38,295,594.0,3.0,2015-07-27,"I have never been much of a burger person. I do enjoy a good turkey burger.This is what i have always ordered when i went to Red Robin. The burgers were average. The bottomless fries are cool they are better will the fry salt of them. I like my fries a tad bit more crispy out and inside. I enjoy the apps more than the burgers. They have some of the best onion rings and cheese sticks. They are to die for, believe me. They have large servings and other things such as salads and entrees that aren't burgers. So you can have your pick.  The restaurant is set up like a old school diner with modern upgrades. Pretty nice ! The kids menu is awesome. They can get a little backed up on the weekend. The issue is they are in a hot bed of restaurant on the south side. If i want a burger and im  in south ridge without a doubt ill grab a grilled chicken sandwich from Kopps or a turkey burger from Ruby Tuesday. Red Robin is a good addition to the choices of places to eat from southridge. I have no complaints. Im more a local home grown type of guy who wants to support that. Versus the chain eateries that move in my area. I will go back to Red Robin in the future.  Dont let the 3 stars fool you. Its a great place to dine. The staff are usually courtieous and welcoming.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brookfield,3.44,3.44,3.44,2.7960000000000003,3.4400000000000004
18,Denise M.,"Milwaukee, WI",28,27,45.0,2.0,2015-09-23,"Ok, I usually like Red Robin, but last night's meal didn't really cut it.  I am loving that they embrace low-carb options like lettuce wrapped burgers (and they do it well so you can hold it like a regular burger to eat it) and they offer a ""skinny"" vodka strawberry lemonade drink, however, the quality and taste were lacking.  First the drink.  It was $7.03 for the skinny strawberry lemonade and vodka.  It didn't have any flavor and I can tell when there's vodka in my drink and this was waaaay light.  A $7 drink better be good but this didn't even hit the mark.  No sweetness or lemon flavor and no vodka flavor ... It tasted like strawberries in water actually.  Second, I ordered the chicken tortilla soup and lettuce-wrapped mushroom Swiss burger.  It came on a rectangle shaped plate with a little square ""cup"" of soup that spilled out onto the burger wrap.  The soup was the best part of the meal, just wish it had been a real cup ... Felt short and cheated a bit.  The burger lacked a sauce like mayo or something.  It consisted of a burger, a piece of cheese and just dried sautéed mushrooms that were falling all over.  I've had this there before and it was awesome so I know it was different.  Usually there's a mushroomy gravy and mayo ... Not last night. Hopefully this isn't a sign of quality changes there.  For price and quality of last night's meal I have to rate my visit there a two-star event.  Will consider a revision of I have a better experience the next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brookfield,3.32,3.32,3.32,2.6640000000000006,3.3200000000000003
39,Jenny L.,"New Berlin, WI",2,12,,4.0,2015-10-18,"I went to Red Robin recently. The Purple Prickly Pear Lemonade is ridiculously delicious. And looks hilariously alcoholic according to my cousin. A retro purple color liquid in a savvy glass that seems acceptably groovy. Its bottomless refills. I would have loved to drink at least 4 glasses but I got full after 2 glasses and my meal. Its reasonably priced at $5 for as many refills as I can drink. Sadly 2 but I was very satisfied nonetheless. My cousin had a burger with a mint brownie shake that she downed with no problem. Except her burger that only half was eaten. It wasn't as good as the shake (according to her as I looked at the licked clean drink). But then again she had no idea how to fit the burger in her mouth... it was huge! Appetizer: spinach dip....creamy cheesy goodness...with spinach. Our meals came also with bottomless steak fries. I don't know anyone who eats more than three servings or fries but hey...its a good deal Red Robin! Our single portion was enough.Totally going back again.

28,Maria B.,"Milwaukee, WI",2,22,,5.0,2015-11-15,"Stopped in last night after doing some shopping at the mall.   The place was PACKED!   The wait was about an hour.   Kind of a long wait for a burger joint, but we didn't feel like going elsewhere and finding out the wait was just as long.   Not everyone was being as patient, as we heard one group complain to the Manager that they were about 5 minutes longer than their quoted time, but he seated them quickly after that.   We were seated near this family, unfortunately.    The service was fantastic, the food was good as it usually is at Red Robin, they are always very consistent.   The only thing that detracted from our experience was the guest that complained about EVERYTHING.   I saw our server struggle to take their order as they basically disregarded the menu and made up their own menu, which took about 5 minutes.   Then, once the food arrived, they complained about it very loudly to the manager, who was clearly exasperated with them.   They complained about the ladies room being dirty (I went in, it wasn't).   Basically, they couldn't be pleased.   I even heard them talk about how excited they were to send in a bad review. So I'm writing this review because despite dealing with these difficult customers, our server was fantastic!   She kept a positive attitude with us, despite our neighbors.   Our burgers were fantastic, and served quickly.   The Manager stopped by and chatted briefly, and was very professional.  He even personally delivered more fries to us!  Yes, the wait was a bit long, but it was a Saturday night at the Mall, so it's to be expected.    Great job, Red Robin!   Keep your chin up, some people are just difficult to please!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-brookfield?start=20,3.32,3.32,3.32,,3.3200000000000003

The parking is chaotic since it's part of a giant mall but nevertheless I always have the upmost patience to find great food at different restaurants. The waiting time for a seat was exceptional and their staff are very friendly and knowledgeable.

It was a little more updated and cool than I thought, and I dig when they have the pay at the table option on the tablet - makes work lunches a nice quick in-and-out.  They offer their meat patties as well as either a Boca burger or a Gardenburger for no extra charge. There are options of either steak fries, sweet potato fries which are bottomless with any entree. For upcharges you can also get garlic fries or other delicious options.  I got a Gardenburger with onion straws, steak sauce, blue cheese lettuce and tomato. The burger was great, the toppings were so flavorful and the fries were hot and fresh. Our server was prompt and our drinks were always filled.

2,Melissa S.,"Milwaukee, WI",29,202,879.0,1.0,2016-04-03,"So I am so disappointed with the remodel of this location I have to downgrade it to 1 star. The designers did a horrible job with the layout. Seats are almost touching or with very little space between tables. I could barely get into the bench seat against the wall in the bar area. I can hear every word of people sitting next to me. No privacy and even worse the tables in bar area are high tops with the smallest top ever. Barely enough room for 2 plates and drinks - each table has those ziosk things you use to pay or order and they take up a huge space now. Center of table is filled with 2 spices ketchup and drink menu which takes up even more room. What if I want an appetizer and a glass of water plus a cocktail?  Where am I going to out all that???? Very bad design overall. When I went to restrooms the whole corridor was filled with extra chairs apparently removed from the main floor to make more room. Clearly there is a problem. Poor lady in wheelchair was waiting for table and I have no idea how they were going to get her to a spot safely.  The food is the same but the ambience is ruined. I will wait to go back for awhile to see if they fix it. If not, I'll have to seriously consider giving up one of my favorite chains to eat at.

Started out ordering a blue moon and getting a Stella. Not a huge deal I don't mind Stella so I just went with it. Ordered one of the new burgers(something with tortilla chips on it). Got the $2 upgrade for what I was told was a ""larger"" quantity of meat. The sandwich came and the patty was about the same thickness as the fries. Would have hated to see the amount of meat the normal sandwich came with. And the normal sandwich had 2 patties. Must have been paper thin. Then my wife commented on the consistency of the bacon on her chicken sandwich. After trying it i couldn't help but notice it was pre cooked bacon you would get in a box at the grocery store. It was paper thin rubbery with next to no flavor. And lastly my wife ordered a Mai tai and it had no flavor of alcohol. She is a light weight when it comes to drinking (1 glass of wine and she is sleeping) and she felt nothing after this large drink.

The seater looks like she is high on something (not life) and simply looks at us, ""how many"" she finally mumbles. She then disappears and seats the people ahead of us, ok but then another seater comes along and takers the group that came after us.  Ok interesting.  Well we finally get seated and I must say waited on rather quickly. Our orders are in and we received our drinks, life is looking up. Except everyone around us is getting their food, even the people who came after us. Interesting again right. I guess our freshly butchered cow took a little longer to go down then everyone else's. Finally we got our food and it was ok, didn't look like the pictures but it was ok.  My wife's and my burger were good, my sons meatballs on sticks were decent, sad looking but decent. However my daughter's past looked like left over noodles microwaved with the last of the sauce drizzled on the top of it with some form a weird parmasen cheese sparsely put on the top.  We ate, drank (with the slow refills, first off I'm getting my money worth by how many drinks I can put down), and the kind of sort bottomless fries must of found the bottom with 1 refill split between 4 people.  Now any placer that gives you Lawry's season salt should know that their fries are going in my belly faster than mini Me.  Instead of seeing how everything was the waitress came over and set us up to inn the damn table tablet and looked bothered that we asked for more fries.  Fry me damnit so I feel like I got my money worth.  One look of disgust was enough so we left after that. It would of been better with a little better service and some smiles. You are in the business of service, whatever happened to service with a smile.

My friend's burger came with only a piece of lettuce and nothing else. The appetizers of my friend we're not that great either. He ordered Battered Mushrooms and when they came they looked like little pieces of dough dumped in batter. THEY WERE SLICES OF MUSHROOM DUMPED IN BATTER AND DEEP FRIED! REALLY? We complained to the manager and he gave us new burgers and an extra order of zucchini sticks. Also he cut the bill in half which was very nice, but we heard from more tables that their orders were not correct.
