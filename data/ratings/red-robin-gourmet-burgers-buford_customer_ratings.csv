31,Philip D.,"Gainesville, GA",1,25,17.0,1.0,2016-09-04,"So, they just opened 4 days ago. What an extreme display of unorganized chaos. I walked in the door, greeted with a smile and a hello but with the 5 servers talking to the manager they forgot about the customer. I walked into the bar area to place a to-go order and it took the bartender 3 min to recognize me. I was the only person there with 3 bartenders. I ordered $60 to-go and while waiting I had a cup of soup. I sent it back, it was cold. I asked for the manager and indeed it was replaced. While sitting there I watched a bartender open a customers to-go and eat a garlic parmesan fry and close the box. Best of all they were my fries, and I called her out on it. She then proceeded to argue with me in front of John the manager. I was asked if I wanted new fries but so disgusted I wanted to leave. I should not have to ask for food your bartender ate from to be replaced. I sure hope this place gets better!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-buford?start=20,3.0760000000000005,3.0760000000000005,3.0760000000000005,3.0760000000000005,3.076000000000001

33,Katy G.,"Johns Creek, GA",69,7,1.0,4.0,2016-09-16,This was my first time at any Red Robin and what could have been a bad experience was turned around by great service from our waitress and an attentive manager. I went with my husband and our two kids at dinner time and it was very busy in the restaurant with lots of families. Our waitress was wonderful! Extremely polite and attentive to what we may need. When we got out food my order was incorrect even though the waitress had put it in the way I ordered it. Long story short - it got sent back twice because the kitchen kept making it wrong. In any other situation I would have been livid but the waitress brought me something to eat in the mean time and the manager came over to speak to us and ended up comping my meal. Thank you to the management there for making customers your priority! We will be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-buford?start=20,3.536,3.536,3.536,3.536,3.5360000000000005
4,Andrew M.,"Athens, GA",201,1,,1.0,2016-09-17,Horrible service. Our waiter didn't refill our drinks and it took them 20min to notice. We came specifically to watch the Georgia game and they refused to change the TV for one guy watching the Ohio game. Last time I checked I lived in Georgia so it only made sense to have the game on. If we weren't already seated and had our food on our table we wouldn't have came.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-buford?start=40,3.236,3.236,3.236,3.236,3.2360000000000007

1,Lydia P.,"Muskogee, OK",7,5,,3.0,2016-09-26,The hostess was very helpful but my waiter was not around enough. He barely checked in and when I needed something I didn't see him at all. The burger was horrible. I tried to eat it because I was hungry but it reeked with liquid smoke flavoring. I had the speckled salad which was better but kind of strange because they combined fresh fruits with canned and thawed frozen fruits. It was tasty but the texture was a little off putting.

22,Suhana A.,"Lilburn, GA",64,311,191.0,4.0,2016-10-04,I came here last night with friends. We were seated promptly and given menus. I ordered blue ribbon burger with garden  patty (vegetarian). You can order anything on the menu and substitute the beef patty for vegan or garden patty. Anyways I got sweet potato fries on the side and this raspberry lime Sprite bottomless drink (forgot the name). The drink was really good- I had 4 glasses of that. The sweet potato fries were okay. I've had better. My friend got garlic Parmesan fries which I thought were way better. My burger was pretty good. I will come back to try other new things.

18,Andre' M.,"Johns Creek, GA",69,395,97.0,2.0,2016-11-12,"Not very good in my opinion.  My patty was dried out and appeared to be much thinner than those in the pictures. I even asked the manager if they might have given me the wrong patty but he said no.  I had asked for some pink to be in the patty but there was no pink to be found.  Trying to be healthy, I got the wedgie burger which uses a lettuce wrap instead of a bun. I also opted for the side salad instead of the bottomless fries. The fries would have been way more satisfying than the very boring side salad that didn't even have cheese (I think that it was supposed to have cheese). My wife did like her veggie burger and steak fries. One daughter who is a huge chili fan got the chili and said it wasn't that great.

17,Erin C.,"Suwanee, GA",129,141,1723.0,4.0,2016-11-13,"The TV commercials for their $6.99 burgers + endless fries peaked my interest for Red Robin, so we decided to check out their new location at the Mall of Georgia for dinner last night. It's located at the same entrance that Buffalo Wild Wings is, where finding good parking is usually a pain.  The hostess told us it would be about a 10 minute wait, but that we could be seated in the bar area immediately if we liked. Their bar area is pretty spacious with a lot of high-top tables or the actual bar top to choose from. We chose a small two-top table by the wall. I was surprised to find padded chairs that were pretty comfortable. Service was great, too. Our server/bartender, Tiffanie, was really sweet and knowledgeable about the menu.   I ordered Red's Tavern Double Burger ($6.99), which comes with two patties, their ""secret tavern sauce"", American cheese, tomato and lettuce. It also comes with endless steak fries, but I substituted with a side salad, which is also endless. I really enjoyed my burger, especially for the price. My side salad came topped with chopped tomatoes and cucumbers. Nothing spectacular, but it satisfied my veggie craving.

Food:Tried the Billion Dollar Baby and A1 Peppercorn burger.  Now let me tell you about this Billion Dollar Baby!!!! So so so so amazing.  Soft ciabatta bread meets a juicy burger, nice crispy bacon, crunchy potato cake (reminded me of a McDonald's hashbrown), and truffle oil infused cheese.  It is a wonderful combination.  I think it is only for a limited time, so go get yours!!  A1 Peppercorn burger was okay, nothing too special.  You like fresh cracked pepper with fried onion bits, I would recommend you give it a whirl. Now these endless fries... yes they are endless.  Nice plump steak fries.  Sprinkle a little season salt and it is good to go.  Or you can try any of the flavored ketchup, which is worth the couple of extra coins.  Give them all a try.  I'll def be back to try each and everyone of them.    Service: Sat promptly by hostess, who was super friendly.  Drinks were always full.  Basket of fries were always full.  Food took a little longer then expected, but was worth the wait.   Ambiance: clean, modern, burger joint.  Casual attire.  Personally, I would wear clothes that allows for some growth in the midsection.  I walked out super full. Dranks: Full bar.  Good beer options.  What I like is that they provide good beer pairings with some of their burgers options.     Overall: Good experience.  One of those places that you walk out and are like, money well spent.  Enjoy!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-buford,,,,,

After 10 minutes we finally got our drinks ordered and was able to order our sons kids meal. It was then another ten minutes before our food order was taken. Our sons food arrived literally right after our order was taken so he was done eating before our food even came and wasn't very happy sitting and waiting while we ate.

Unfortunately I work under them and while they were building/ constructing (to replace Ruby Tuesday's), we had multiple sewage leaks. Constantly ruining merchandise, and maybe that doesn't really have much to do with my actual food review but it did take me a long time to eat here. My first experience was awful! The server was very uninterested and it took an extremely long time to get our food and forget about refills.  My BF ordered a Root Beer float and they gave him a glass of ice cream along with a separate glass of Root Beer! Then proceeded to tell him to pour it/mix it himself.?.? Who does that?? The burgers were nothing special and we all just left feeling like we wouldn't go back. (Missing Ruby Tuesday's). The second time it was my sons BDaY and he requested burgers. The Mall is a central meeting place for my family so we all agreed to give it another go. MUCH better! The staff was different and got themselves together. The kids enjoyed milk shakes and we had wonderful apps.  The classic Onion Ring Tower and Poutine! First time having this and I have wanted to for such a long time. I really have nothing to compare it to but I enjoyed it. Again, the burgers were just alright but we all left having a much better experience. If you're at the Mall there are way better places to go. If you want a casual burger it is probably hit or miss..

20,Lucy E.,"Marietta, GA",0,10,,1.0,2017-10-09,"Horrible service....I can't stress this enough. We ate here on Columbus Day after the lunch rush. We waited at the host stand for several minutes without being greeted. The manager finally got up out of the booth she was sitting in to take us to a table. A filthy table I might add. The restaurant wasn't even busy so why would you take us to a dirty one and make us watch you clean it with a soaking wet towel? We had to ask our waitress to dry the table off. I'm sitting here watching dirty tables not get bussed, employees have gossip hour instead of checking on their guests and annoyed patrons. All this is happening why your lazy manager sits in a booth and catches up on paperwork. Last time I will be here...do better!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-buford,3.56,3.56,3.56,,3.5600000000000005

27,Pam R.,"Jackson County, GA",48,5,,1.0,2017-11-11,"My honest opinion: DON'T SUBJECT YOURSELF TO THE HORRENDOUS SERVICE OF THE WAIT STAFF HERE! My husband and I had been wanting to try this restaurant for awhile. We were excited that we were finally getting a Red Robin restaurant near us. Boy, were we disappointed! I can't really judge the food because they never got anything on our order right, but the service was the worst that we have EVER received and we eat out a lot. Our first waitress rolled her eyes, threw her hands up in the air and handed us off to another waitress because we asked for more time to look over the menu. Our second waitress had an obviously bad attitude, did not write any of our order down and threw my drink on the table because she was asked to correct it. When our food arrived, absolutely everything that we had ordered was wrong. Honestly, we might have allowed them to attempt to correct it if it weren't for the rude, disrespectful manner in which we were being treated. Absolutely uncalled for!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-buford?start=20,3.32,3.32,3.32,,3.3200000000000003

We were sat in a booth next to another booth which looked like a dumping ground for all dirty dishes, perhaps a large party had just left? There were plenty of servers walking around or sitting talking and no one busing tables. We sat waited 8+ minutes, seemed like an eternity for a server. Table next to us which had already been sat and ordered had received an appetizer yet no drinks.

16,David T.,"Tucker, GA",88,5,,1.0,2017-12-17,"We ate at Red Robin in Cumming yesterday and had a great experience. We were at the mall of Georgia shopping and decided to enjoy it once again since there was one in the mall. Not the case!!!  We had our baby with us again and we were treated well in Cumming. They knew she was young and were aware that babies have a limited amount of time before they get antsy. This Red Robin had ZERO clues. We were seated in the back where our server only had one other table at the time. He took our drink order and seemed pleasant. But the drinks took more time than usual to get to our table.  He took our order after 15 minutes of sitting there. I ordered a soup and it took ten minutes for him to come back and tell me they were out.  I asked for sweetener and he forgot. I had to remind him.  The food came out OVER an hour after we ordered and it was NOTHING like the one in Cumming. It was bland and dry. By this TIME our 7 month old is ready to blow.  I had to walk her around while my dry, bland food got cold.  When I came back, the refill he gave me had zero ice and two empty glasses were stacked up on the table. I was so frustrated at this point so I went up to the bar to get more. He met me up there and asked what I needed so I told him ice, which he promptly retrieved for me but this was the first time he really showed any initiative. He really never seemed to check back and disappeared in the back the whole time.  We are for sauce on the side twice and he never brought either one of them. I left to get the car because I just wanted to leave  my wife came out when I pulled up and a stranger had to open the door since the hostess was sitting in a chair looking at her phone. Not professional.  With all of the other places to eat at the mall, I would avoid this one. Not even as a last resort.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-buford,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96
11,Dollie P.,"Atlanta, GA",43,91,182.0,2.0,2017-12-30,I usually come with a great outcome. Today service was mediocre. I came on a Saturday around 5pm. I ordered the limited burger taco tavern with open face (half a bun). The sandwich looked NOTHING like the picture with minimal taco crisp chips & no dang salsa. They forgot my salsa so asked for it on the side. I had to cover my burger with a napkin to preserve it's warmth. It took 20 MINUTES for them to bring the salsa and it was COLD! Like fresh out the refrigerator cold. Why would I put cold salsa on my burger?? On top of the that the burger tasted like something from the soup kitchen (probably because it was missing most of it's ingredients!) I'm very disappointed today & hope service can improve because I still want to believe in the good of Red Robin. YUMMM!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-buford,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84
