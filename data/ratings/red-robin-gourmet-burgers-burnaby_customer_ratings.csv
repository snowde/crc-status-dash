He dropped a bowl of cheese in my drink. He cleaned up the mess of cheese and soda on the table with his hand. He was sorry that it took him so long to get back with  more cheese that our meals were half done, but there were several metaphorical trees to pee on and legs to hump on the way. He forgot to bring me another drink. He charged us for sides that he forgot to bring. He blamed the kitchen. He called me ""dude"". I am an adult woman. I do not take that as a compliment.

The burgers stay the same, the bottomless fries are still awesome...although I never seem to make it past the first basket. This place needs a makeover, or one huge wipedown. It seems a bit lacklustre these days.  I ordered the new chicken ham and cheese burger. I wasnt impressed. It was very sloppy and the toppings slid out in each direction. I couldve used 4 toothpicks to hold it in place. But since I was paying, and hate making a fuss, I ate the damn thing. hehe. My wife always seems satisfied with the Salmon and Chips. So I stole a few bites while she got up. It was amazing. It wasnt overly greasy and delicious.

This particular location is unfortunately graced with borderline rude hostesses(when a child comes up to the stand, and stares at the hovering balloons, would it not behoove you to ask ""would you like a balloon?"") The burgers are fairly typical RR fare and for the most part are pretty good.  A disappointing Salmon burger took things down a notch though(not sure whether the problem was the coleslaw within, the tight amount of tartar spread, or a combination of things).  Try the Fries with Jalapeno and cheese though.  They're good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-burnaby?start=20,2.284,2.284,2.284,2.284,2.284
33,Shae A.,"Maple Ridge, Canada",55,112,5.0,4.0,2013-03-13,My hubby was craving a Red Robin burger so we stopped by on our way back from IKEA.  I was pleasantly surprised to find they offer a Gluten free bun for their burgers!!  Awesomeness!!  It's a nice looking bun and soft and tasty.  I'm so happy to find another place out that I can have regular food like a burger!   I had the simple beef burger and it came with lots of toppings on the side so it was very flavourful.  A really good deal for the price.  A lot of places start at 10 for just a burger.  This one was 8 something.  My husband had the royal one that comes with an egg on it - sounded weird to me but he loved it.   The service was very friendly.  All very young staff.  They seated us in what seemed like the kiddie section so that was a bit annoying since we would have liked a cozy booth.  But I guess it was busy.  The waitress also made sure my fries were salt free since she said their fry seasoning contained gluten.  So nice of her to be thoughtful of everything.  They don't give you a ton of fries but they offer free refills.  I like that better since the smaller amount was just right and I have a tendency to finish everything on my plate.  Whereas my man scarfed down his fries as fast as he could so he could have seconds.  haha  So it works well for whatever fry eating style you prefer. But ya - 2 thumbs up for the excellent gluten free bun option!!  I'm already planning to take my Mom to a Red Robin later this week so she can try it.  We are blessed to share the same troublesome gluten intolerant stomach.  haha  :),https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-burnaby?start=20,2.32,2.32,2.32,2.32,2.32

I didn't know until yesterday they have a patio here which is a nice bonus, it's off the back of the restaurant so not much of a view but it's small, quiet and in the shade! I like the options they have for their burgers, you get a variety of bun choices and can sub a vegan or vegetarian patty into any burger.

35,T Y.,"Burnaby, Canada",10,261,1.0,1.0,2013-10-24,"We've lived in the neighbourhood for 6 years now and this has always been a regular hangout of ours. That being said, it was only a regular hangout because it was 2 blocks from home and we like the food. However, the service here has ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS been horrendous. It's just a varying levels of horrendous. Once, we waited 45 minutes for our food. Another time, we waited 25 minutes for anyone to even talk to us to get our drink/food order. We almost always have to do something extraordinary to get drink refills. The list goes on and on. All the managers know us as we were regulars. We've made comments about the service more than once. We don't get this level of service at other Red Robin locations so I think this is just a poisonous work culture at this location. The last straw was our last visit.  We wanted a table and not a booth. They made us wait a little longer... fine... they seated several other tables before getting back to us. That would have been fine except that there were plenty of regular tables available when we walked through the restaurant. The manager took our drink order. 15 minutes went by before we got our drinks from the waiter and he took our food order. A food expediter brought our food. All 4 of us had empty drinks for a very extended length of time. We went to the bar and asked for refills and some other minion brought us refills. The waiter finally appeared again (we didn't even see him walking around his section so there was no opportunity to flag him down) and took our plates away... no asking if the meal was ok or if we wanted more fries (as they're bottomless). We asked to see the manager... this was a new one we hadn't seen before. He was apologetic in a fake way and seemed to not want to do anything to fix things. He offered us a free dessert. Sorry dude, a free dessert doesn't cut it when your staff has screwed up every part of the visit. I'm not fishing for a free meal... I'd gladly pay you every cent if you guys weren't so incompetent/indifferent. As it is, we vowed to never return (and expressed this to the manager who still didn't want to do anything about it). 6 years... going about every other week at $40 per visit (for me and my fiancee). Wow... we really have spent about $6K with these chumps in this time.

44,Betty G.,"Burnaby, Canada",0,3,,2.0,2013-11-18,"This my letter to  Red Robin head office because the of my problem with the managment. I am 41 years old and I have been going to the Red Robin on Cameron since my 16th birthday and everyone wore red suspenders .So it was my Birthday yesterday and  we thought why not go for an even 25 years.  And yes it might have been late to sign up for a card but just to be safe we called up Red Robin on Cameron and they said come down it should not be problem, happens all the time.(plus we didn't really care about the coupons its just I have been coming here for 25 years so why not keep with tradition.) So then we get there we tell server she says no deal. We tell the server politely  that's fine too ( I kinda wanted the calamari anyways). All of sudden a greasy haired woman who's shirt was only half tucked  and is not wearing a name tag comes up to my table telling me she the manager and then starts in with barrage of condescending questions. Such as if we had allegedly called her restaurant why she didn't know about it.  So to summarize I must have wasted over 10-20 minutes of my life on birthday listening to this woman berate me for her lack of  management skills. No gift of time for my birthday at Red Robin... But I wil say head office called me and were quite thoughtful after I said they could have no more of my time.  This was there responce. I am truly sorry you had a poor experience at one of our restaurants, especially on your birthday. We made a mistake and let you down.  I don't want to take any more time away from you as you have invested a fair bit already to give us feedback, which I very much appreciate.    I want to apologize, we did not handle your celebration properly or make you feel special on your birthday or even allow you to enjoy our great food and service.     If you ever need something from Red Robin, please give me a call.  I know we can deliver a great experience to re-enforce your memories of the past and help create new ones.    Which was very impressive , I wasnt expecting it to be that good but I still won`t back to Cameron for awhile but I have some trust back in Red Robin Restraunts.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-burnaby?start=40,1.8960000000000001,1.8960000000000001,1.8960000000000001,1.8960000000000001,1.8960000000000001

The burgers were up to par as usually and although I normally give chain restaurants a 3 starts, I'm giving this one 4 just because of the service I received from Tara that night.  The Birthday performance was nice as usually and although there were only 3 table at the end of the night, she still got them to clap and pay attention to our party of 5.  It was nice.  If you get Tara, tip her well, her service is great as well as the rest of the staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-burnaby,2.064,2.064,2.064,2.064,2.064

41,Natasha B.,"Burnaby, Canada",12,51,26.0,1.0,2015-03-14,"Well I truthfully don't know where to start. I came here for a business meeting as my office is not too far from this location. Firstly it was practically empty yet it took 10 mins for the server to seat us to a table. Once we were seated the manager did quickly come to ask us what we would like to order and our drink selection. The server brought our food and drinks at the same time. Now if your thinking wow the food came out fast......you're wrong!!!! It took nearly 15 mins to bring a glass of water and a ginger ale. Personally I think that's pathetic as its not complicated drinks that would take a substantial amount of time. After we received our food and finished it and were waiting for the bill patiently. I noticed from the corner of my eye that our server was text messaging on his phone in the corner. NOT ONCE did he ask, "" how are you, can I get anything else for you"". Finally after waiting nearly 10 minutes I walked over to another server and requested the bill immediately as I had a meeting to attend to and was going to be late. It took ANOTHER 10 minutes to bring the bill to us. Now I always tip 15% even if the service is mediocre. Well for the first time in my life I gave a 10% tip which I don't even think that was deserved. If I could give less than 1 star I would. I was really pissed off and upset. If you're around this area I would suggest any other restaurant than this one. Food may be cheap and decent quality but the service was absolutely horrendous for a restaurant that was not even busy. Overall I was incredibly disappointed and will NEVER come back to this specific Red Robins again. OH and one last thing now that it comes to mind the parking is horrible there.

I upgraded my review from a 1/5 (which really should have been a 0/5) to a 3/5 because I ordered the chicken fajitas (which has been an old favourite of mine) and the fajitas hot plate was in fact, rather decidedly not hot, and the tortillas, which are always pre-warmed and ready to go, were also rather decidedly not warm.

17,Alexandra S.,"New Westminster, Canada",74,162,165.0,1.0,2015-09-12,"Wow, never again. I've been to the Thurlow location a few times and always had a good experience. This Burnaby Red Robin location is a disaster.  First, we waited 25 minutes to be seated. We were told it would be a long wait, so we grabbed a drink at the bar while we waited.  When we were finally told there was a seat available, we asked if we needed to settle up at the bar first. We were told it could be added to our final bill. Great.  Our server greeted us and asked if we wanted a drink. I looked at him confused. He had just handed us our drink at the bar... I pointed it out to him and he said, ""oh yeah"" and walked away. Um, I still wanted water... Moving on, he came back a couple minutes later and we ordered our food and told him we had a coupon for the birthday special.  After that, it all went downhill.  We waited 35 minutes for our food. 35 minutes! Our server never came back to let us know what was going on with our food (or with water). Whenever we made eye contact with him, he would walk the opposite direction. We finally cornered him when he was closing the bill on the couple behind us and asked him to check on our food. After watching him wander, and not go to the kitchen, I had enough and approached a manager. I told her we had been waiting 35 minutes and we were hungry and angry. She said she understood and that she would check on our food (didn't apologize). After speaking with her, she immediately brought our food (so how long was it sitting in the kitchen for?). We were missing a dip that we ordered but she brought it when we told her. We also didn't have any napkins or cutlery, but she brought the napkins when we told her. She also explained that the kitchen was slow but didn't say much else.  As for the food? Our burgers were cold and burned. The fries were meh. Our server checked on us once. We told him our burgers were cold but that we were also too hungry to wait for new ones. He said he would mention it to the manager. When our bill came, our server told us that the birthday burger was free and that he were given 50% off our second burger. Then he asked what we had to drink at the bar. We told him and he asked if we had any beer. We said no. He said he would be right back. So basically, they almost charged us for someone else's drinks.  When he came back with our correct bill, he mentioned that he was new and that the kitchen was crazy, with burgers getting mixed up. No kidding. At least two tables near us sent their burgers back because they weren't theirs! This Red Robin really needs to get their act in order if they want to stay in business. They should also have a policy regarding how much  perfume/cologne their servers can wear. Too much isn't always a good thing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-burnaby,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32

20,Lena R.,"Vancouver, Canada",8,130,50.0,3.0,2015-10-24,"My family and I have been coming to this place for years. It's so close to home, which makes it convenient for when you're too lazy to make dinner yourself. It was a little lackluster when I was a kid, so we stopped coming for a few years. However, we decided to give it another try. They updated their menus - instead of the large, 14x11 sized plastic sheet with every item on it, it's now presented like a small book with each page breaking the menu into sections. Makes it much more presentable. The way they present their food has improved. Instead of giving you a basket lined with wax paper with your burger and fries, they present it on a plate with the fries in a metal casing (I have no idea what it's called). I always get the simply grilled chicken burger, and it's been a hit every time. My mom usually orders a salad of some sort, and my dad always gets his Royal Red Robin burger. We feel like it's improved. I was surprised to see so many negative reviews on this location. Maybe we're just lucky. However, I will say that we had a less than great experience last night. Food took a long time to arrive, but the manager approached us and apologized on her own accord and assured us it would be out soon. Food arrives, Dad's burger is cold and the bottom bun looked inedible. Mom's salad was missing the chicken, which they quickly retrieved. My burger was fine. Fries were hot. No complaints. We did get my dad's burger comped as it wasn't acceptable.  Here's the thing though. It was a Friday night. It's an affordable, white-bread family restaurant. Lots of families live in the area, so where do you think they're going to go? It's a zoo on the weekends, packed with kids and parties and the like. We don't usually go on the weekend, so that's why our experience was so disappointing. My advice: go here for your meal on a weekday. Much less crowded, still kids and whatnot but not nearly as crazy as six o'clock on a Friday night.  Things happen, mistakes are made. I have had enough good experiences here to vouch coming back.

Another time the waitress wasn't outright rude but she seemed slightly pained to serve us. The fries seem to be changed now too.. Maybe a different recipe?  Super dry.

I came here with friends cause majority ruled. I did get a grilled salad, however, I had to give a whole list of modifications to make it healthier.

That RR was really good. However, I noticed a trend where service and quality seems to be suffering for quite some time at Red Robin. Something is just different at RR these days. The amount of food is not bountiful as it used to be, staff not as caring. RR is simply a burger place. Period. If you are one of those annoying people who don't like what is on the menu and what modifications, and the restaurant go out of their way just to satisfy you, I don't want to know you and I don't want to be anywhere near you when you dine. To make matters worse, many people like this gloat when they get their meals comped because they make outrageous requests because the restaurant has good ethics.  Any way, I hope RR improves back to how they used to be about 10 years ago. Furthermore, I hope the restaurant industry decides to stand their ground and simply say, no substitutions or modifications to their menu items. If you don't like the menu, go someplace else.

15,Dining L.,"New Westminster, Canada",0,9,2.0,2.0,2016-12-23,"The two stars should be 4 stars for food quality, but because the service was way below acceptable level of par there's no way I can give the whole experience as a 4 star. The service was 1 or even zero. I come to this restaurant about once a month.  It's hit and miss for service. Sometimes they staff are spot on, attentive, friendly, on the ball.  Other times (like last night) it was beyond horrible. Even when we left the plates and cups were still on the table that were brought for appetizers and long since empty.  We each had 3 beverages, which equated to 6 glasses still on the table. Wait staff came and went. They showed up ever so often bringing new food items (there were 10 of us), but never taking any empty plates away.   Basic wait service would be to remove empty plates and glasses. Basic wait service would be to serve guests in the order as they ordered. A guest that arrived a half hour after the first person ordered got her meal FIRST! And the rest waited another 20 minutes! One had a bacon burger - the bacon portion was a tiny sliver of a piece of bacon.  Another person had bacon on their burger as a condiment, and had LOTS of bacon. What's up with that! We were not offered fries or a starter as we waited almost an hour to get food (except for a couple of the guests meals). Most of us ordered without modifications. Those who did modify got their orders as ordered. It's hard to review a restaurant that is inconsistent. Sometimes I can be in and out in an hour. This time we were out in 2.  Suggestion: Re-train wait staff about removing plates. That's my #1 complaint ongoing. Seems wait staff don't think it's their job to remove plates, only bus people.

We were sat fairly quickly. We sat and did not have anybody come to our table for 10 min!!  Finally our server noticed us:/ we ordered whisky bbq beef burgers. Asked for fries to start off before we get our burgers. Got the buzz sauce( soooooo good) and baja sauce for the fries. Apparently they are charging for dipping sauce as it was not the cass before. Ended up getting two types of sauces. Ordered a monster strawberry milkshake and a lemonade. We literally waited sooo long for our water and lemonade. I dont really understand as it was very very slow. Our waitress (Ali) did not seem to be all there as she missed pretty much everything we asked.  No cutlery on table. No fries to start. Got the milkshake wayyyy in advance even though we asked for it with our burgers.  While we were sitting at the table, we could hear the kitchen staff/ servers talking loudly and very unprofessional. Heard swearing. Singing loudly to music. Felt like there was no enthusiasm coming from the staff! Customer service definitely has gone downhill:( We saw others looking around while staff were laughing obnoxiously and very immature. I believe Red Robins can improve if paid more attention by managenent. Hope to return back and see improvement.... I come here often and this is by far the worse service provided. Very disappointing!

In addition to getting a free Birthday Burger, you get ""Exclusive Surprises"" throughout the year (had one earlier in April of this year). The latest promotion was basically a 2-for-1 burger deal. Sure, their burgers aren't necessarily 5/5 prettiest or best-composed, but they make a good effort. And if you remember that their burgers come with unlimited fries or salad, you are basically guaranteed a filling meal with every burger. At 2-for-1, two can dine for easily much less than $20. (After tax and tip, we were only $15.) Red Robin is about decent tasting burger and excellent bang for your buck (and non-alcoholic drinks are cheap cheap cheap!) [Pig Out Tavern Double ($10.29) hardwood-smoked bacon with creamy bacon-crumble aioli, tomato and lettuce.] ""Double"" meaning two patties. Broad but thin patties, so it's nice to get two. Good smoky flavour in this burger elevates it above mediocre to pretty darn decent. At $10.29, that makes it really good taste and value for your money. Patties appeared moist and nicely done. I opted to change my fries for salad and asked for dressing on the side to control it. Sweet honey mustard dressing was very sweet, so be careful about putting too much.
