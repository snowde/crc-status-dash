I came in one night with my brother for dinner and it was like a complete ghost town. The whole decor of this restaurant made me feel like I was at Denny's, shame, fail, tacky!  Now the food, I ordered an avocado burger and woah! Where was the avocado?!? o_O there was just a bunch of shredded lettuce, flavorless burger.. I didn't finish it and who could I complain too? The waitress was MIA, I saw no other staff members around. I saw her till she brought the check, could have probably walked out without paying and they would have not noticed that is how dead it was... I wouldn't come back to this RR location!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-calabasas,2.372,2.372,2.372,2.372,2.372

We usually stop by before hitting up the movie theater across the street at the commons. I always order the same thing, A1 peppercorn burger, lettuced wrapped and with a little bit of pink in the middle. Apparently they do not have a medium or temp button on their POS systems. It was a funny conversation with the waiter actually about how you cannot order something medium, you have to specify you want a little bit of pink, that is what they button says that they send to the kitchen.  The burgers always seem fresh, need a little more seasoning but that is what the super awesome seasoning salt is for on the table. The french fries are never ending and make sure yo ask for a side of camp fire sauce, quite possibly the best dipping sauce invented for fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-calabasas,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003
9,Todd N.,"Los Angeles, CA",462,583,506.0,1.0,2012-06-02,"I rarely do this, but I just to have rewrite my latest and not so pleasant experience here at RR.  This is my go-to place and I have been a valued customer for awhile, and I can't even count the number of times I've been here! As a disclaimer, this rewrite has nothing to do with the quality of the food, but the service alone.  Service in my book definitely makes or breaks it in terms of satisfying the customer even if the food could be really bad, customer service will outshadow that problem; however, in my situation the service made the food not taste as good. My issue is with the lack of service that my family and I received upon sitting down.  We were directed to the booth in the outer most corner of the restaurant where at first seemed fine as there were other restaurant goers.  Our waitress was very attentive at the beginning as we were still waiting for one more member of my party and gave us plenty of time for our last person to come and go over the menu.  By the time, the last member of our party came she seemed to have vanished all together as the entire back section of the restaurant was completely empty, and we were the only party in the back.  It became even more odd that our waitress' section was the very front of the restaurant of about maybe 4 tables as ours is in the way back - in my head, it did not just make sense even logistically to have her do one table in the back and 3-4 tables near the front.  She was so occupied with the tables upfront that she barely was around to get us more water, fries, and dipping - it was absolutely ridiculous as I was constantly waving my hands frantically just to have her see me!  What also seemed to bother me was how slow the food came out, we came at 8pm on Friday, and I even asked what time they closed (11pm).  At first, I was being optimistic in the respect that the kitchen is slowing down because they're about to close but 4 hours prior for the food to be slow? That's absolutely ridiculous! And I almost felt rushed as well because the other servers were going to the other empty tables around us wiping them down and refilling seasoning and ketchup - it was honestly such a weird experience.   I'm never sitting in the back ever again nor would I recommend it UNLESS there are other parties around you, if not you mind as well just go up to the kitchen yourself and refill your water, dipping, and fries.  I really do like RR, but if the service is gonna be like this, I might have to reconsider.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-calabasas,2.56,2.56,2.56,2.468,2.56

6,Joey D.,"Anaheim Hills, CA",155,453,213.0,1.0,2012-08-29,"Red Robin... yuck! Sorry, had to do it.  Anyways, this Red Robin was terrible.  I went on  Sunday night and as soon as I walked in I could see the utter disappointment on the staff's face ""Oh no, we have to work??"" There were probably only 2 other customers inside.  It seems like the sunday night crew is used to doing nothing - they were great at it. I should have know it wasn't going to be a good meal at that point - aside from the staff, the place was FREEZING, which is something I've never complained about before and there was a weird musty smell when we walked in. We got seated and waited over 10mins to get our drink orders in.  We placed our food order when the drinks came (4 of us) and waited almost 40mins for dinner.  Shortly after dinner our check arrived  - quickest service of the night. I ordered a turkey burger and it was easily the worst turkey burger I ever had - lukewarm and no flavor.  I've had a turkey burger at other Red Robins and they were all fine. Drink and fry refills were impossible.  Aside from  that, the tables were really run down, some were chipped real bad and broken.  The restroom was disgusting with dirty floors and used paper towels all over the place. This place is poorly run and should be overhauled.  I've never had a bad Red Robin experience before coming here.  The best part of the night was leaving.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-calabasas,2.6,2.6,2.6,2.372,2.6

4,Troy H.,"Chatsworth, CA",810,654,195.0,3.0,2012-09-16,"One of the closer burger chains in Calabasas, I went here to lunch with a couple of friends. I have been to their chain at the Topanga mall as well. They have a variety of different burgers. Their two best in my opinion have to be the Red Robin Gourmet cheeseburger which is garnished with crisp lettuce, fresh tomatoes, pickles, onions, mayo & Red's pickle relish. You choose your favorite cheese: Cheddar, American, Swiss, Bleu, Provolone or Pepper-Jack and their Red Tavern's double which is topped with melted American cheese, fresh lettuce, tomato and Red's Secret Tavern Sauce on a toasted sesame bun, all wrapped in foil to help contain all of this Tavern goodness. I went with the Tavern and it was ok. This was due to the fact it was a bit over grilled and could have spent less time. The fries were good, and I washed it down with an Ice T.  Service was ok, not great. It took more than average time to bring out our burgers and they spent more time refilling our drinks than bringing over the food. So it didn't help when our food arrived the burgers were over-grilled. If it wasn't for the length of time it took to get our food and the over-grilled burgers the fourth star would have been given.  Parking is a non issue. Their lot has plenty of space.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-calabasas,2.76,2.76,2.76,2.604,2.76

This particular location was unique in that it looked nothing like any Red Robin I had ever seen. Turns out it was formerly a Howard Johnson's.

53,Matthew M.,"Woodland Hills, CA",25,68,13.0,2.0,2012-10-25,"Holycrap, this place reeks of mediocrity. The one saving grace (the second star) was our server. She was great. Our order took forever, and then it came out wrong. You could see the exasperation on or server's face when she realized the kitchen made us wait for ever for or dinner, and then it was made incorrectly. She apologized a lot, and brought us free sweet potato fries to make up for it (tasty!). The burgers were mediocre, and on the small side, looking not a thing like the pictures in the menu. I mention this because they were really disappointing. Seriously.  The endless streak fries were meh, and the whole experience just dragged on for ever and was a bit overpriced for the quality and (minuscule) quantity of food you get. I have our server  a decent tip though, because she did the best she could with what she had. My advice: get a better burger for less at the Stand on Canoga, or Islands (if you simply must have the busy, noisy family environment). (The Stand totally wins that one, btw--great food!).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-calabasas?start=40,2.8,2.8,2.8,2.568,2.8
21,Lauren T.,"Westlake Village, CA",73,216,13.0,1.0,2012-12-07,"Before anyone reads further... this review has 1 star NOT because of the food.  Food was 4 stars...  We took our family of 5 to Red Robin last night... Upon walking in, the hostess took us to the back of the restaurant where there was an ending soccer party group. The server said that was the only place she could sit us and that the party was in the process of leaving... We sat there with the notion that they were all exiting since they were all standing up and kids were RUNNING AND SCREAMING throughout the place...  For 40 mins, I watched kids throwing their shoes all over, running and screaming, throwing chairs down, jumping on booths and the tables, jumping on top of tables and hitting the ceiling, throwing their shoes at the ceiling, throwing shoes and touching their big screen plasma tv's, while the parents of all these children just sat there and MANAGEMENT NOT ONCE came over to stop the AWFUL AWFUL behaviors of these children... Isnt it a health issue when people arent in their shoes??? Isnt it a health issue when barefoot children are jumping on empty booth tables in their dirty barefeet? At what point should a manager step in and say, ""Your party is distrubing other patrons in the establishment, can you please tame it down""... WE has several kids run up to our table and scream in our faces... It was absolutely ABSURD and I blame both the parents of these terribly behaved children and the management for not taking care of their other PAYING patrons in the establishment.  There is NO excuse what so ever for the types of behaviors going on there last night and no excuse management could ever make for allowing such disgusting things that went on in there to go on.... 5 stars would have gone to our server Juan, who I believe really tried hard to keep us happy and taken care of while we were there... He would be the only reason we would EVER go back, and I even notated that on my credit card receipt...

49,K S.,"Agoura Hills, CA",4,23,1.0,4.0,2014-02-12,"The food is alright.  Typical greasy chain restaurant menu, no surprises there (so that's why they lose a star).  That said, you know what kind of food they serve if you've seen any of their commercials.  What gives this place points is the service.  The staff at the Calabasas location are genuinely friendly and attentive.  Monica is an amazing waitress!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-calabasas?start=40,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92
1,Jennifer S.,"San Diego, CA",375,493,899.0,4.0,2014-03-07,"My bff and I have been to this Red Robin a few times as it's close to her place. I've always liked their burgers and their BOTTOMLESS FRIES, hello! This time around, I wasn't feeling as hungry and my friend suggested I get a kid's meal. I ordered a kid's Clucks and Fries (chicken tenders) and the portion size was perfect! Two pieces of crispy chicken tenders and fries with a side of their ranch dressing, SO GOOD! And the price at 5 bucks was perfect too!  We were here on a Friday night and it wasn't packed. Our server was a nice gal, very attentive, came around and checked on us, didn't push the bill on us too soon, refilled our fry basket at our request. Plenty of seating inside, booths are nice and comfy. They've got multiple TVs showing whatever game is on at that time. There's plenty of parking on both sides of the restaurant and easy to enter and exit the lots.   I really like this location, maybe a tad more than Topanga. Good comfort food and good service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-calabasas,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96
2,Rachel N.,"San Rafael, CA",45,275,24.0,3.0,2014-04-03,"Red Robin is very middle-of-the-road, especially in this location. I'm not a huge fan of eating ""gourmet"" burgers (read: anything that doesn't come out of a greasy fast food wrapper) and so the food is good, but never exceptional. I sometimes get their chicken bruschetta sandwich, which often has some unpleasant gristle on it. It seems they are as fond of making it as I am of eating it.  I've tried a few other things lately. The mac and cheese is strangely pungent and not overly worthwhile. Their French onion soup is surprisingly palatable, if not a touch too salty. The salads are nothing to write home about.  For all my commentary about their food, the service here is generally pretty good, and the location sports an outdoor dining area, which is nice. This location will be closing in a few weeks, however, so if you are (bafflingly) a fan of their burgers or other fare, you'll have to hit up the location at the Topanga mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-calabasas,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004
32,Amy R.,"West Hills, CA",60,3,,1.0,2014-04-10,"I got food poisoning at this RR from a burger.  The waiter kept asking me if I wanted my burger to be a little pink.  I asked for medium.  When I got it, the bun was soaked from juices, so you couldn't even pick it up and I was sick as a dog for 2 days after eating it.  I'm glad they are closing!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-calabasas?start=20,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004

This last trip I brought my grandchildren. As always, they have a good children's' menu. My grandchildren love the cheeseburger (they actually eat the whole thing!) I love the salads and my wife the gourmet burgers. All done well. And the bottomless fries are not good for the waistline, but delish going down. Alas, they are closing their doors for the last time. We will miss our neighborhood Red Robin!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-calabasas,3.08,3.08,3.08,,3.0800000000000005
