16,Jess G.,"Silver Spring, MD",65,285,151.0,2.0,2012-10-14,"I've been to Red Robin before and normally it's not bad - this time, however, I tried to get something different and possibly healthier.....next time I'll pick a burger like usual...and get a shake or root beer float too. The other options seem to be really lacking.  I got the Whisky River BBQ Chicken Wrap. Overall it just seemed...mushy. There was too much liquid (bbq sauce and ranch) and not enough crunchy veggies. I also didn't think the chicken was high-quality. There were supposed to be tortilla chips to add some crunch, but I didn't see any until I got to the end of the wrap. I was also hoping to substitute sweet potato fries but found out that they'd be more than a dollar to substitute (and I thought more than $10 for a small wrap and fries was a lot). I ended up sticking with the steak fries, which I only really like because of the spices Red Robin has at every table. The spices they have are ones that I put on a LOT of food at home, so it's a nice touch.  My boyfriend got the simple grilled chicken salad, which was fine, but nothing special: iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, croutons, and lackluster vinaigrette dressing. My dad's oktoberfest burger was really good -- the description on the menu didn't seem like something I'd like, but I'd actually order it. My dad said he wishes it was on the menu all year long.  In addition to the blah food (that's my best description for it), the waitress was hovering all meal. She came by at least 3 times while we were eating to see if everything was ok, and she stayed an uncomfortably long time after we answered the same way each time (that everything was fine). Other than that, the service was fine, but the hovering waitress was pretty annoying.  Like I said, I've had good burgers, shakes, and root beer floats (unlimited!) at Red Robin before. I would just recommend that you not try anything different - stick to what they do best!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-california?start=20,2.408,2.408,2.408,2.408,2.4080000000000004

So classy.  Anyways, our usual order is the pretzel bites with a burnin' love turkey burger. Both of these items always have come out amazing for us! The quality is consistent, which I really appreciate.  My best advice? Stick with what you know, and stick with what the restaurant is all about.

For lunch it isn't bad, but not my ideal place for dinner. There is better non-chain places to eat and make better food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-california,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48

43,Shane M.,"MECHANICSVLLE, MD",2,39,11.0,5.0,2016-11-04,"BOTTOM-LINE:  Inexpensive, bottom-less fries are a great perk, burgers are delicious, and no wait normally.  SPEED:  Visited on a Friday evening at 4:30pm. Plenty of seats available; was seated immediately at a table near the bar. Waiter (Derrick) approached the table within 30 seconds. Waters were on the table within 2 mins. Orders placed within 3 mins and food delivered within 15 minutes hot. We were in and out of the restaurant within 45 minutes. You can't beat that. Derrick was always on the ball as well - very pleased.  FOOD SELECTION: We ordered two ""gourmet"" burgers on gluten-free buns: A1 Peppercorn and The Burnin Love. Wife rated the A1 as satisfactory because she had to have the fried onions removed (gluten-Intolerant). With that in mind, she would have ordered a different option. My burger, the Burnin Love, was awesome. I smashed that thing. Highly recommend it for those who want a little hotness to their burger. Our BOTTOMLESS (unlimited) fries and broccoli came out hot too - not at room temperature as other reviewers have stated.  OVERALL: Best place to sit down for a quick, inexpensive dinning experience. Aside from Five Guys, there's no other burger palace in St Marys that can top this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-california,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6
40,Megan R.,"North Charleston, SC",72,377,60.0,4.0,2016-12-01,"The Red Robin Royale changed my life.  If you haven't had egg on a burger (don't make that face, just trust me and try it), this is where to start.  I think it's something about the cheese and the egg that meld together to make this burger perfection. Customer service is hit or miss here.  I have repeatedly had issues with hostess attitudes over the years.  I think they fail to realize they aren't bouncers.  The manager/floor-managers is/are always quick to fix any issues.   Tip: If there are smores sweet potato fries on the menu, order them as an appetizer.  #notsorry",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-california,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68
4,Brian S.,"Morehead City, NC",0,11,1.0,2.0,2016-12-06,"Burger was good, first plate of steak fries were good, Lagunitas beer was good...but that was it. Nothing too spectacular here. Least attentive bartender I've had at any restaurant in quite a while. It took nearly 10 min of sitting at bar (and there being only two other people at the bar) to finally be just acknowledged by bartender, or any of the five or so employees that walked behind the bar after I sat down.  Then, not a hi or how are you this evening, just can I get you something to drink. Got my food and finished my entire plate before bartender even spoke up to me...and that was to ask if I wanted more fries...which came to me barely even warm. I was never asked if my food was ok.  I was never asked even for another beer...WHILE SITTING AT THE BAR!  Bartender was apparently more interested in other things behind the bar. I find Red Robin's are usually pretty good, but not a good showing for this one tonight. I'm off to get another beer somewhere that may appreciate my business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-california?start=20,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68
2,Al J.,"Patuxent River, MD",0,12,,4.0,2017-01-02,Went for lunch and had a Wedgie Burger for a change of pace.  It's a burger with a lettuce wrap instead of a bun - the gluten free buns are not too good.  Ordered sweet potato fries and salad as a substitute for the regular fries.  Sweet potato fries were good and would order them a gain.  Burger was cooked to medium rare as ordered.  Ate in the bar at a high top with two others. Meals came out together. Others were burgers and cooked correctly.  Our server Casey was prompt and followed up to ensure the meals were okay.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-california?start=20,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72

They were perfect anoint of breading which was fried perfectly were it was super crispy but the onion ring on the inside was still a good texture.  My southern comfort burger was cooked a little too well I would ask for it now rare if i could, but my sweat potato fries were delicious and endless. I wish i had the stomach for a third serving.  The campfire sauce is delicious the give it with the onion rings but they go great with fries.  I had too give them 5 stars for the service. We had 20 people and our waitress and staff did a marvelous job keeping track of everyone's food and beverages.

56,Brett G.,"California, MD",0,7,,1.0,2017-05-15,"This Red Robin was pretty good when it first opened. However, that hasn't been the case for the past several years. If you're looking for good food, good portion sizes, with fast and friendly service...then run away from this place as fast and as far as you can. I've been taken to this Red Robin (reluctantly) a several times over the past year. Every single time, the service gets ruder, the wait for food gets longer, and the portion sizes get smaller. It used to be that that the Royal Red Robin burger was a good size hearty burger, but it has shrunken to about half the size it used to be. And for whatever reason, this location won't let you get fries before your meal anymore. This is not the case for other better Red Robin locations (Annapolis). And God help you if you sit in the bar section. The bad service gets even worse, as you get completely forgotten about by the bartender because you aren't sitting directly at the bar. On every occasion this past year, either my food or someone else in our party's food order gets completely messed up. And the evident disinterested staff could care less about making a speedy correction, as the corrected order takes another 20-30 minutes to come out. By which time everyone else's meal is done and no sort of compensation or discount is even offered by staff or management. When the order does come out correctly, it is usually sub par in that it is usually not hot, or very sloppy put together. The bottomless fries aren't really that bottomless either. And by that I mean I can literally see the bottom of the tray when they bring a new tray of fries out, with about only ten or less fries in the tray. If the parking lot on Friday through Sunday nights is any indication, we won't have to worry about this shirts location much longer, because it will be gone. Texas Roadhouse, Olive Garden, Cracker Barrel? Parking lots jammed packed. Red Robin? Parking lot may be a quarter full at best. Clearly management doesn't care anymore, which is a shame, because it used to be a decent place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-california,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92

42,Phil Z.,"Newburg, MD",3,50,,1.0,2017-07-08,"I made the mistake of giving Red Robin another chance.  I chose it because it was a convenient place to meet some friends.  But I was truly amazed at how poor and overpriced the food was.  My bill was $16 for a basic cheeseburger, fries, diet soda, and tip. The burger was tasteless, topped by a micro-thin layer of cheese, and dressed with unremarkable pickle slices and an unripened tomato slice. The steak fries were bland and certainly not worth the caloric intake. They are bottomless, but who would really want more?  There are just so many better places to get a burger, including many lower priced options.

39,Crystal D.,"Hampton, VA",8,2,3.0,1.0,2018-01-14,Absolutely livid right now! I got a 2go order tonight and got the nachOMG as one of my orders which I had asked them for more topping and to layer it which I got an up charge for(since the previous 2 times I have ordered it you enjoy the first 5 or 7 chips which have everything on it and it's delicious but then the bottom 20 chips are naked tortilla chips) well tonight when I went in to pick up my order... the nachos had barely any toppings on it at all. So they remade them and when he came back with them I just looked at him and said would you pay $10 for this (not including the up charge that I paid for toppings I wasn't receiving) he said no and agreed they had little to nothing on it. Then he came back a third time and it had more but it was all piled on top and not layered but I said whatever and grabbed my food and went home. WELL when I got home my husband and son (3 years old) go to get some and my son after a few chips pulls something out of his mouth... it was paper. My husband spit out the nachos currently in his mouth and guess what... there was paper and he didn't even realize it because it wasn't thick and rips as you touch it. You can see words on the paper. So who knows how much was consumed. Never again will I get my family food from this location again! What if my son Or husband choked on the paper?!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-california,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84
