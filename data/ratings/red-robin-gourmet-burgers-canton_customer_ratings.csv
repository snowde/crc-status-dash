The burgers were bland and were in desperate need of seasoning.  Half way through we added the seasoning that was on the table, and it helped slightly.  I am very disappointed.  Neither my husband, son or I are interested in giving this place another chance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-canton?start=40,2.7920000000000007,2.7920000000000007,2.7920000000000007,2.7920000000000007,2.7920000000000007

34,Mar A.,"San Mateo, CA",245,247,293.0,5.0,2013-05-15,"We were in Canton for 4 days and had 3 meals here.... I'm not one to frequent anything other than a Starbucks regularly on vacation... but this particular Red Robin made we want to come back. The food was your typical Red Robin fare... burgers, steak fries, sodas, and a full bar. Our first visit was a late dinner. 2 Royals, the cod sandwich, and a regular cheeseburger. We also had a few margaritas and a couple of beers. Nothing about the food itself stood out, however, the SERVICE WAS PHENOMENAL. Between the management checking in on us, our server being on top of ordering, getting everything out in a timely manner, and the bussers clearing empty plates/glasses and refilling waters.... It was like a symphony. I've had this type of service at high-end restaurants, but would never expect it from a Red Robin. Needless to say, we tipped well that night. The following day we came with a large group. 3 in our group had never been to an RR (don't ask me how they've lived 35+ years of their life in the USA and have never eaten at a Red Robin). Just like the previous night, service was stellar.  We thought... this couldn't possibly happen a third time. But it did. Oh it did. Just two of us this third time.... but the service was just as on point. Man.... the management at this store needs to go around the country and teach other locations how to get service right. They're doing a FANTASTIC job!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-canton?start=20,3.0600000000000005,3.0600000000000005,3.0600000000000005,3.0600000000000005,3.0600000000000005

So I would have been happier over at Five Guys, but my daughter want to come here for her 7th birthday with our family and her best friend. Besides, they have balloons and sing to you, right?  Not in our case apparently. We arrived around 3:20pm this past Saturday (3/8/14) with a party of 8. We were told the wait would be 45-60 minutes.  My daughter did not care and want to stay and wait... ok, fair enough.  We were actually seated in less than 15 minutes... so far so good. I let the hostess know it was my daughter's 7th birthday and that she was excited to be there.  ""Tell your server"" is all she said. Ok. Our server introduced himself and I proceeded to let him know. He acknowledged the birthday and took our drink orders. Then we placed our food orders. We waited until after the food came for silverware and drink refills were scarce and by request only. One of our guests was offered more fries (lucky dog). As the meal wound down and it was clear we were ready for our check, my daughter's friend reminded our server once again ""It's her birthday today"". He chuckled and said ""I know"". About 10 minutes later we were asked if we'd like dessert or anything else. We skipped dessert as birthday cake was waiting at home. After that, he brought the check and said ""have a nice day"". I was really, really ticked off. My daughter was confused as the waitress two tables over led a Happy Birthday Chorus to another patron. I tipped the waiter $1 on a $76.00 bill and noted that the tip would have been $20, but he completely blew off what we were there for.  Between the lack of cleanliness and the disregard for customer service, I will not be back to Red Robin.  If I want a great burger, I will cook at home. If I want a great burger and happy workers, I will go to Five Guys.

The restaurant seemed a bit dirty like a film over everything-odd. Once the food came it was very good. I had the Red's Tavern Double and it was very juicy and tasty.

28,Abigail C.,"Detroit, MI",1,21,,2.0,2014-08-06,"Please, please please, pay heed to the bad reviews on here!  I didn't and had a horrible anniversary dinner there with my fiance back in mid-July.  Yes, we got seated right away, but the service was so-so. We barely saw our waiter unless we flagged him down.   Then there was this:  ""Could we just get water?"" ""Is bottled okay?"" Which is the exact same thing as:  ""Could we get Pepsis?"" ""Is Coke okay?"" We assumed by how they said it, that there was no price difference. WRONG. $2 for a bottle of water obviously bought from a Big Lots or Aldis where they sale those huge 24 packs for $3-4. I wouldn't have even minded paying if they gave use a brand name, decent water, but they gave us cheapest of the cheapest (when other tables served after us where given Dasani). You always tell people that there's a charge. Then, instead of telling us that they were taking it off the bill, the waiter just walked away after we complained. Ten minutes later he came back with a changed bill. That's great, but you should also tell the customer what you're doing.  The food was sub par, but the guacamole was  clearly bad before I touched it. I thought that maybe it was because avocado goes brown quickly. When I tasted it, I was wrong. It was so far bad that I wanted to lock it up. When the server came back and I explained, he condescendingly gave a speech about oxidation and avocados. When I again said that it wasn't that it looked like it had good bad, but that it TASTED rotten and I wanted it off my bill, he instead insisted on bringing me more stating that ""maybe this one is from last's night batch."" He brought out another, bigger one with guac that looked as bad and tasted as bad as the first. He refused to listen when I said it had gone bad this time as well and wouldn't take it off my bill. I was pissed, but this was my anniversary and wasn't going to let myself be annoyed by 2 bucks.  However, the rest of my anniversary was ruined by the fact that I got sick soon after the meal and continued to be for almost 2 days. My fiance didn't get sick and the only thing different from our meals was that darn guacamole. The guacamole was bad and they refused to listen. Ridiculous way to run a restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-canton?start=20,2.568,2.568,2.568,2.568,2.5680000000000005

Service is definitely hit & miss depending on your luck of the draw. Food quality is good, but nowhere near what it used to be and no better than places that don't ""specialize"" in burgers.

Even though it was the begining of the lunch rush, I was seated right away......given a booth which I requested as getting onto the higher seats is difficult. Within just a minute or so, my wonderful waitress, Melanie came up, introduced herself and took my drink order......which was only water today. I had a difficult time in choosing which burger to get. Do I order my usual Mushroom and Swiss? Do I try the Royal with Bacon and fried egg? Hmmmmm the Prime Chophouse? YES PLEASE! Was so excited to bite into this burger when  Melanie brought it to me......medium cooked burger with just the right amount of pink inside, horseradish, sauteed mushrooms, melted provalone cheese, topped with crispy onion straws and steaksauce on a toased onion bun. From the first, (very messy), bite to the last, I was in burger heaven! Such a wonderful marriage of flavors.....I found my new, favorite Red Robin burger! When I ordered, I asked Melanie for a side of mayo to dip my fries in......most servers forget to bring it out....and she also brought out a side of the ""campfire"" sauce for my fries since we talked about it and both agreed how tasty it is......she didn't even charge me for it. She was an outstanding waitress and I made a point to mention it to the manager. Melanie was outgoing, super attentive, and a total rock star!

8,John H.,"Akron, OH",126,51,10.0,5.0,2016-11-18,"Our family of 6 was looking for a place to stop for dinner. We didn't want fast food, but we wanted a sit down place that was fast. The kids decided on Red Robin. The staff were very friendly from the minute we walked through the door. It was a Thursday night and looked busy to me (maybe not to the people that work there) because we got right in and seated within a minute or two.  Zach was our server who was awesome! He interacted with our kids, asked for our drink order and, if we wanted to put in an appetizer to start off. He returned with our drinks within a minute or two and proceeded to take our food order, with a smile I may add.  The food came in about 10-15 minutes, which I consider fast considering there are 6 meals to prepare. The food, I might add looked and tasted great. My wife ordered a burger that was wrapped in lettuce instead of the bun that she raved about. Three of my kids ordered from the children's menu (mac n cheese, burger, and corn dog mini's) which all of them devoured. My oldest daughter ordered a turkey burger and raved about the flavor of it. Personally, I ordered the Avo-Cobb-o salad that was absolutely delicious; possibly one of the best salads I've had.  Also, the pre-meal activities for the kids were impressive- they have chalkboards the kids can play with as well as touch screens with trivia games- this was an ingenious idea. I do want to mention that Zach was an incredible server and I would try to recruit him for a sales/marketing job if I had the chance. We highly recommend Red Robin at the strip to all families for a great family friendly dinner experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-canton,3.08,3.08,3.08,,3.0800000000000005

9,Meredith M.,"Canton, OH",30,14,4.0,2.0,2017-04-04,Went to Red Robin today for lunch after a long hiatus following horrible service and mediocre food the last visit. Unfortunately things have not improved.  We were seated at a dirty table...the hostess intentionally placed the menus over the remnants of the last guests rather than grab a cloth and clean it up.  The waitress was friendly and personable but didn't offer fry refills and also didn't check if we needed anything until we were halfway through the meal. The food was okay...fry refills were pathetic and way over salted. The place was overall pretty dirty...food all over the floor while 2 managers stood around with the mess in clear sight...and the back of those machines on the table...ugh are they ever cleaned?!? I wouldn't say I won't ever go back but I'm certainly in no rush...too many other options at that price point.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-canton,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006

3,Raymond M.,"Ravenna, OH",189,137,1339.0,4.0,2017-05-18,"Oh Red Robin, how I love your burgers. Seriously, they are very good. Not to mention, your choices for unlimited side options, really is quite the appeal. I just wish your service was always as predictable as your food. I have been to several Red Robin locations and either the service is fantastic or horrible. Not often is it right in the middle. I would have to say this time the service was about a 7. Not amazing enough to write home to mom about (anyhow. mom was present) and not mediocre enough to make me not want to return.  Let me start off with the interior of this place. I cannot say enough good things about the inside of this joint. Probably one of the nicest looking Red Robins I have been to (short of the Orlando location in FL.) From the awesome lights, to the cool red leather chairs to the amazing wall decor, this location was awesome. Definitely a very comfortable and inviting feel. On top of it, it was SUPER clean. You know me, I love me a good clean restaurant. This place delivers! The hostess at this location wasn't necessarily the nicest human I have come in contact with. She wasn't rude or mean, but considering that this is the first POC when you enter an establishment, I expect some personality darn it! Arrived at about 4pm and got seated relatively quickly. Our server was friendly (yet oddly absent at times). She greeted us within 5 minutes and we got our drinks within a reasonable period of time. She forgot the lemons on our drinks and despite being reminded, it was until our food arrived that we actually got them. We ordered a plethora of food items. We were a group of 8. I could write forever with detailed descriptions, but ain't no one got time for all that. So, here is a brief synopsis: 1) Onion ring short stack: Crispy and flavorful and PIPING HOT. Love the BBQ sauce they give...perfect to dip fries in too. 2) Fish N chips: Not a lot of fish pieces....definitely skimpy. Crispy on the outside and meaty on the inside. 3) Red Robin cheeseburger: A classic burger. Simple and yummy 4) Smoke N pepper burger: LOVE the bacon on this. The special smokey catsup is also awesome. The flavors on this are on point. 5) Bonzai burger: Sweet and salty with a slight Asian flare.  6) Mac n cheese side: Not your usual mac n cheese. It is a white sauce and covered in bread crumbs. Flavorful and cooked well 7) Steamed broccoli: cooked perfectly. Awesome unlimited side option that is so much healthier than fries. We also asked for melted butter and then seasoned with salt and pepper. 8) Side salad: I was not a huge fan of this. Mostly iceberg, it was far too white and sort of had a preservative flavor. I want to see more green....isn't that what salad is about? Maybe more romaine and some spinach or kale? 9) French fries: Crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Paired with their seasoning blend, it makes them addicting. It stinks they come in such tiny portions.  10) Milkshakes: I do not drink these, but everyone who got one (two plain chocolate and one cookies and cream) said they were amazing! Overall, this was a winner winner burger dinner for my brothers 26th birthday bash. This location is on the Red Robin short list for sure!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-canton,3.28,3.28,3.28,,3.2800000000000002

I have been going to red robin for years but i've never done takeout, it seems un-organized, first there is a curbside option, but when you order online it doesnt give you the curbside option, it says you must go inside to pick up, no big deal, but then you get inside and there is a line of people (because its lunch hour) waiting to pickup their food, and nobody standing at the front desk, there's also nobody at the front desk to greet people coming in to be seated so one of the guys from the bar area came over and started seating people because the lobby was full, i don't know about everyone else but when i order to go during the week its usually on my lunch hour and i dont have very much time to stand in a long line with nobody there to get my order.  I would say as a suggestion if any red robin managers are reading this, when it's lunch hour and you have to-go orders, at least have someone up front getting those orders.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-canton,3.08,3.08,3.08,,3.0800000000000005
