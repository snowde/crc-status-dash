But for your own good don't order their Boca burger. I wanted to be a little healthier since I got their chocolate shake (great btw and so are their alcoholic bevs) and my first order of Boca burger was still cold! Obviously frozen so they took back the burger and I kept my sweet potato fries. They returned with a hot new veggie burger and a boat of fresh normal fries which was really nice of them. I expected a better veggie burger warm but it was still like downing bread on bread on bread. Service was good but just stick with the real meat for this one. I usually do but idk what came over me lol. The guacamole burger is my failsafe staple! And ask for their sweet chilli sauce on the side u won't regret it.

I didn't even get to try the food & I've never been to Red Robin.  However, when people are hungry & need to eat at once it doesn't do your business any good to have no seating area for customers, a line to the hostess stand + expect people to wait God knows how long for your food i.e not bothering to post anything telling us about the wait time.  I'll pass.   Maybe next time you should try posting how long the wait is so folks will actually be swayed into hanging around instead of fearing they're blocking someone's path.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place?start=160,2.36,2.36,2.36,2.02,2.36

I've been to a NJ RR and enjoyed the ""bottomless steak fries"".  Well, in short , Carle Place left me cold.  The service was really uneven.  The lighting was like a cafeteria, glaring down on you like a rotisserie chicken, I kid you not!!! lol Our server, although sweet , completely jumped ship, although she passed us no less than 6 times as we attempted eye contact for a refill of ""Bottomless fries"" or ""bottomless beverages"".  There seemed to be issues with her section, but at least 5 or so other employees were nearby that clearly could have helped our table & section out.  Finally got those refills from another server.  If they dimmed the damn lights and straightened out the service, it would no doubt be a better experience.  The food was tasty but one definitely needs a beverage to wash all that salty, albeit yummy grub down!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place?start=320,2.24,2.24,2.24,2.12,2.24
310,Wolf G.,"Delray Beach, FL",272,228,185.0,3.0,2012-01-30,"After Red Robin came to Long Island and my friend who used to enjoy Red Robin when he lived in Colorado, we decided to go this Red Robin when he was visiting me from Florida along with his girlfriend. Walking into Red Robin, you will find that the atmosphere is clean and cheerful, with all sorts of kitschy items like posters hanging on the wall. After we were seated, I decided to order a Banzai Burger wrapped in lettuce due to my gluten allergies with fries and a Diet Coke. Within fifteen minutes, our burgers and fries arrived and I was ready to dig in. While the burger was seasoned well and was complimented by the sweet and sour pineapple and the fresh and crisp lettuce and tomato, I found the burger to be somewhat disappointing as it was kind of dry and crumbly. The burger may have been disappointing, but the fries (which are unlimited) were thick, wide, and filled with potatoey goodness and were complimented the spicy seasoning at the table. Service from our waitress was friendly and accommodating as well. As far as the prices, they are OK, at about $9 for a burger and fries. While I would go back to this Red Robin as my friend is a huge fan of it, I prefer Bobby's Burger Palace at Roosevelt Field or Five Guys for a better burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place?start=320,2.24,2.24,2.24,2.1879999999999997,2.24
268,Joel D.,"NY, NY",22,119,5.0,3.0,2012-02-12,"Ok so there was ONE person who told me that Five Guys was NOT the best chain burger they've ever eaten and they told me Red Robin was so I had to check this place out.  Upon entering Red Robin I had wait for a seat. My first thought: ""Am I here for a burger or a 5 course meal?""  Ok so my friend and I were seated after a few minutes, and then a few more minutes later our waitress came to our table only to mutter ""I'll be right with you."" All I wanted was a damn burger, and it was too much trouble already.  Finally when the Burger came I was pleased. I ordered their signature ""Red Robin Burger""  The bun was fresh, the meat was tender and evenly cooked although the meat patty itself lacked seasoning and was bland and too me that was a big downer.  The burger was less greasy and oily than Five Guys, and the whole presentation of the burger in itself was great, but the quality of the meat I have to say Five Guys tastes better.  Here is an analogy:  -Five Guys is like high performance sports car that might lack air conditioning, comfortable seats or even sound dampening material for weight reduction. This high performance sports car runs loud and the right is stiff and uncomfortable, BUT the car is there to serve one purpose: GO FAST.  -Red Robin in the luxury sedan. Its good for the family, its safe, it has comfort features like heated seats, quiet interior, etc. BUT its is SLOW.  In short, Red Robin has an great look and feel. The presentation of the food is good, the restaurant is nicely decorated, and their whole ""gourmet"" them is played though very well. What they lack is the meat and potatoes (pardon the pun) of a GREAT tasting burger spot.

Appetizers arriving with the entrees, orders filled wrong and twice having to request utensils. The most recent time we were told that they did not have any clean utensils and that we had to wait for them. Mind you, we were already served our meals.

The host was not friendly at all when seating us, the waiter took forever to take our order and when they brought us our food it was overcook and missing some of the things we had asked for. Also they gave us no napkins or sliver ware we had to take napkins from the table next to us until our waiter came back and we could ask him for some of our own. The food was just ok. The mushroom burger had only a few mushrooms and there seemed to be a cheese sauce on the burgers rather than real cheese. We asked for our burgers medium rare and they were well done.

Then my burger comes, I was horrified to find a hair in the burger. They brought me another burger that I didn't even eat because I was grossed out.

Taste wise, it was nothing special.  You can tell they are frozen patties and aren't spiced at all.  Bottomless fries come with the burgers which i appreciate, but the fries here don't deserve a second round.  They are very generic steak fries, which i'm not really a fan of.  Now if mcdonalds had bottomless fries, i'd have a serious health problem.  $13 for a burger, bottomless fries, and bottomless soft drinks isn't a bad deal for a sit down restaurant, but i'd go to almost any other fast food place before coming here. i'd leave just as full and definitely more satisfied for less money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place?start=280,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.184,2.44

It's kind of difficult to find parking because this restaurant shares a private lot with a lot of busy stores in this little shopping pavilion. You should also be prepared to wait if you come at a popular lunch or dinner time and a lot of people bring their children here so it can get kind of hectic with all the little rugrats dashing wildly around your legs as you wait in the cramped little waiting area. The burgers are cheap and I believe you get infinite fries as long as you keep asking for them but I wouldn't see why you would because their fries are VERY mediocre and the only real reason to eat them is to mindlessly stuff your face hole full of food.

A burger, which had ham, sauteed onions, melted Swiss, on top of large burger pattie on a pretzel bun. You sit, take a bit and go...OK. Its not too bad, its not exactly ShakeShack, or Five Guys, but its good.  The pretzel bun soaks up, the moisture from the burger, and your able to enjoy the burger with your ""bottomless"" steak fries, an iced tea, and a Sam Adams.  I'm not saying I am sitting outside a Red Robin with anticipation. But, look I Red Robin can do a burger, and a Jalapeno bottle cap. Could do without the rest of the place though, and constantly thinking of Chotchkie's from Office Space.

I love the food and the shakes. The prices are fair. But the service is terrible! Terrible means waiting 30 minutes before the server even comes by to take drink orders. It means having your order screwed up in more ways than one. It means trying to flag down someone ANY ONE to get a refill, that is IF the bartender FEELS like making mixed drinks. We were told one night that the bartender was DONE making ""complex"" drinks and we needed to limit our drink orders to something they can pull out of a tap. We came at 11pm once (they close at midnight) and the kitchen decided they weren't going to bread the mushroom I ordered as an app because they didn't feel like it. When the food does come out right, it's hard to enjoy it because 9 times out of 10, they FORGET to put utensils and napkins on the table.  How does a franchise fail on every single aspect of customer service??? Where is the manager? Where is the service checks to make sure your staff is performing well? A bartender who doesn't know what beer they carry or refuses to make drinks? A kitchen staff that can't read a ticket and skips protocol on food prep? And servers who are either too busy or don't have enough experience on how to wait on multiple tables? I don't get it.

Afterward, I came to Yelp to read the reviews, and was really surprised at all the criticism. We had a great experience - we loved our burgers and the fries were great. We each tried one of their specialty drinks (I had a freckled lemonade and my companion had a smoothie). It was a hot day, so it was doubly nice that the moment I was sucking down the last of the strawberry slices in my drink my waitress was walking toward me with a refill. The staff was really friendly and pleasant (although one of the hostesses was a bit overly chatty, but she was sweet and kind, so it almost didn't matter). Now. Onto the point of Red Robin - the burgers. We were extremely pleased with our burgers and really appreciated the ooey-gooey quality - hot, juicy, just enough fat to melt all over the place but not so much to be disgusting, and the cheese was melted to a state where it was soft and gooey and melted right into the meat. Other burger joints often either under-melt the cheese or toast it to the point where it's more like the cheesy crust on a French onion soup than a topping for a burger. The burgers are different at Red Robin, so I don't find comparisons to places like Five Guys or Jackson Hole to be quite fair. RR had the hot-ooey-gooey factor, but other places do better with the lean sort of ground beef and grill flavor. The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the menu has items on it that make it seem like RR is dependent on brand name foods/drinks that are processed somewhere else rather than being made in the restaurant and by its staff.

207,Andrew B.,"Woodside, NY",6,68,11.0,2.0,2013-08-13,"I'll start by saying that I've loved Red Robin in the past for a suburban burger experience.  This location didn't deliver.  The restaraunt was crowded, but everyone was being seated and I'm sure it wasn't an unusual amount of people for a Sunday evening.  The service was SLOW, which is an understatement.  Our appetizers and drinks came quick enough after we waited 10 minutes for someone to come who didn't even turn out to be our waitress. But our burgers took forever to come with barely anyone coming to tell us the food was coming soon and appologizing (that came eventually).  In the time it took to get our burgers, I could have went next store to stop and shop and bought chuck steak, went across the street to the mall to the kitchen supply store and bought a meat grinder, set it up, ground the meat, formed it in to patties and cooked it and then go back to stop and shop, buy potatoes, cut them up and fry them. When the burgers did come, they were as I expected and remembered at other Red Robins in NJ and PA so at least that was good, but if I'm in the area, there's a very slim chance I'll be going back to this location.  There are other decent burger options in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place?start=280,2.8,2.62,2.62,2.504,2.692

I didn't really get that whole experience when I went with my family. It was Friday night, but the place wasn't that busy and we got seated right away.  As soon as our waiter came, everything was weird. He seemed to ramble on about what he is supposed to do as a waiter. We order our drinks first (i had the mint brownie shake). At the table we had two shakes, lemonade and a diet coke, and we didn't get any water until we asked which was when the meal came. I find water to be necessary, especially when I have a shake with my meal.  The food was not as great as I would have expected. I had the A1 peppercorn burger medium with a sesame seed bun (instead of the onion one) and it was good for the first couple of bites. But halfway through, the burger became really soggy and Ye bottom bun started to fall apart. At that point I started on the fries. We had 4 burgers at the table, with 4 ""bottomless"" fries but we never got a refill on them, nor on the water. It was an alright experience, but I hope next time I go the burger doesn't fall apart.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place?start=280,2.84,2.6,2.6,2.536,2.696

Fast forward a year and things are running pretty smooth these days. Burgers are great as well as the appetizers.  I'm glad they've stepped up their game and I can give them a decent review. This time for starters, we ordered the jalapeño corn dogs (5 mini dogs with chips) and a shorty stack of onion rings, which came with some good dipping sauces.  Around the table, we ordered the Whiskey River BBQ burger, A1 Peppercorn, Chili Chili Cheeseburger and I got the Bacon Cheeseburger.  You're asked how you like it done, pink or no pink.  For burgers, I like mine a little more towards well done for the crunchy exterior of the patty and they delivered without drying out the meat.  Each of us ordered a different side of steak fries, salad, steamed broccoli & cole slaw because they were free refills like the soft drinks and we were able to sample them all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place?start=80,2.92,2.61,2.61,2.9560000000000004,2.734

335,NoCooking R.,"Manhattan, NY",7,55,4.0,1.0,2013-11-01,"Let me start this off by saying I HAD to dine here (I detest chains bc they never cease to unimpress me) because of the gluten free menu available for a fellow trick-or-treater in the group (not my child). Now that I've gotten that squared away;  we were a group of 9, four adults and five kids. The place was fairly quiet when we arrived after TOT'ing yesterday so there was no reason the service should have been as slow as it was but I digress.  It started to really fill up as we were getting the check TWO hours later.  Now, for a burger chain, this one is pitiful.  I ordered the Bruschetta chicken burger and there was no Bruschetta on it.  The bread was chewy and not fresh.  The food was lukewarm, not hot.  My kids had a pizza and cheeseburgers.  Kids eat crap anyway so I'm just glad they were eating something other than their bag of candy at this point although feeling like a terrible parent for bringing them here... We ordered the tower of onion rings which took too long to arrive.  It was hot at least. The food took forever to come out. Asking for a round of water for the table of our waiter was met with an excuse and the need to remind him.  What the what?  I'm paying you!   We placed our order after waiting too long for him to take it.  My poor son even complained.  He's 9!   My husband ordered a burger and when asked twice by a friend how it was, kept evading the question. I looked at his burger-  it looked like a beef patty not a burger.  Something is wrong with that when this is considered a burger joint. I ordered coffee with my dessert that I never got.  The ""endless bowl of fries"" offer that they claim is really only as good as your server.  I was lucky to my second serving of fries as we were ready to ask for the check, that I had to share with my table because no one else was being asked if they wanted more fries. My friend next to me ordered a chicken wrap and I noticed mostly coleslaw as filler with slices of chicken in the middle.  Pathetic.  My chicken bruschetta was awful.  It was a chicken brick that was warm when it finally arrived. I took a few bites and left it. The waiter was non-existent except to pretend to be helpful as he whizzed by robotically asking ""how's everything?  Good?"" and then he was gone. Dessert was gross.  My slice of red velvet looked greasy and unappetizing.  One bite proved it tasted like their fridge needed a box of arm and hammer baking soda.   This location serves old dessert. My husband said his brownie bowl was no better. There was no flavor!   I took one for the team eating here.  The best was when, our non existent smiley waiter appeared after we paid the bill to ask us to participate in a survey about our experience! Are you kidding me?  Every time I turned around too look for you, I saw you laughing and chatting in the kitchen!   Please spare yourself and go to Anthony's a few doors down if you don't need a gluten free option on a moments notice.  Ugh.  I'm actually sad that this meal cost us 80.00 per couple when all was said and done.  We split the bill.   Bathrooms:  decently maintained but all the way over by the bar and when you are coming out of the ladies room with your children men are coming out of the men's room directly across giving you full view of their bathroom and stalls inside!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place?start=160,2.72,2.56,2.56,2.8840000000000003,2.624

I've had instances where the wait time was 45 minutes, I just went to Barnes and Noble to kill the time. There's always a workaround if you're not lazy. I first went to a Red Robin in Pennsylvania and was dying to have it again.

The waitress passed my table over 10 without making eye contact without coming with my refill. I had to flag her down to remind her about the drink.

330,Bryan V.,"Franklin Square, NY",6,17,,2.0,2014-09-17,"Okay, so, I have two desperate experiences that I want to discuss for this Red Robin. 1) First time, I went with 3 friends. I had a chicken burger and we ordered some appetizers, and those were actually pretty good. So as far as food is concerned, I can't complain tremendously about the first time. However, the service is where the major issues were. The service was moderately slow (not as bad as the second time, but I'll get back to that). The person who made the experience quite unfortunate was the waitress. She was quite poor and granted, my group can be a little loud, that's just how we are. But I guess our waitress took a disliking to us. She'd purposely avoid coming the table to ask us if there was anything we needed. A few times times we even made eye contact with her, it was obvious she saw us, but she went about her business.  The final straw was when my friend and I went to the bathroom. As we were coming back, we heard our waitress talking about us and describing some of the members of our group with inappropriate language. We were so upset that we didn't even leave a tip. I have the utmost respect for people who work in the food industry and like to leave no less than a 20% tip, but there was a clear crossing of the line. Also, my friend has a gluten intolerance disease and he needed his French fries prepared in a separate batch. The first batch seemed to settle in okay, but as soon as he wanted to take advantage of the bottomless fries, he started feeling sick, which led us to believe there was some cross contamination 2) Two of my friends and I decided we'd give Red Robin another chance, but this time turned out to be worse than the first. This time, the waitress we had was about the only good part of it. She was incredibly sweet and apologetic about the woefully slow service we had.  I would never recommend the clucks and shrimp dish. It was shameful how tiny and poor quality the portion was for the price they charged. It was disgraceful. I had to eat like three rounds of French fries because I was starving after having the 3 baby shrimp and 2 small chicken tenders.  During that experience, my friends think we discovered why their service is so abominable. They have their bottomless fries and drinks, but probably want to discourage people from sticking with the slow service. Also, many of the French fry refills were cold when we finally got them.  My friend, once again, got very sick from what we think was cross contamination. We were happy the manager came out and apologized, taking off his meal from the bill, but health means more than money. Because of the slow service and the way the food affected my friend, it's safe to say there will not be a third time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place?start=160,3.44,2.87,2.87,2.7920000000000007,3.098

323,Mitch B.,"Nassau County, NY",8,77,12.0,1.0,2014-11-04,"Poor service begins and ends in the kitchen, not with the wait staff or manager.  Stopped in around 11:30 am on Tuesday, really craving a burger and beer and figuring l'd give Red Robin a try instead of the other burger places in the area.  The place was empty but for two or three tables.  No one was manning the front so the bartender took the initiative and led me to a high table in his area.  I was the only patron there.  Within 5 minutes I had ordered a burger and was starting into my beer.  After a while the bartender headed back to the kitchen to inquire on my burger.  Nothing.  Over the next  20-25 minutes, he went back no fewer than 4 times, apologizing to me after the third time. From my vantage point, I could see his frustration with the cook, who seemed to be making a joke over the situation.  By this point there were maybe seven tables occupied in the restaurant so there was no great pressure on the kitchen.  In any event, it should not take a half hour to get a burger in an empty burger house.   I couldn't help but wonder what was gonna happen when lunch hour was in full swing?  After his fourth visit to the kitchen, the bartender came back with a plate of fries, saying at least I'd have something to nosh on while I waited.  I had actually watched him take two plates off the kitchen counter, apparently for me, only to put one of them back at the direction of the cook.  It appeared to me that the cook was simply enjoying messing with the bartender's order.   At that point I advised the bartender that I was about ready to pay for the beer and leave.  He hustled back to the kitchen, this time with the manager.  I finished my beer and took one of the fries.  It was lukewarm.   I was done.  Rather than make a scene, I stood up, placed $5 on the bar, and asked a young woman sitting there, who appeared to be friends with the bartender, to tell him the money was for the beer and that I had left.  I walked out while the manager and the bartender were  both in the kitchen area, presumably trying to resolve the matter. In the parking lot, I was furious that I had wasted a half hour being played, and I was pissed at myself for leaving anything for the beer.  I called from the car to speak to the manager who was aware of what had happened and was extremely apologetic and gracious.  He offered to make good on it  if I would return to the restaurant, but I told him all I wanted was my $5 back on principle.  He agreed and met me outside with the $5 and the burger and fries wrapped to go, which he insisted I take as a token of his apology.  I did not get his name, but he warrants praise for handling the situation professionally.   When I got to my destination ten minutes later, the bun was soggy and the burger cold.  What a waste.  Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place?start=160,3.2,2.94,2.94,2.468,3.0440000000000005

The staff is incredibly friendly from start to finish, and the only reason I didn't award this place 5 stars is because I felt sorry for the wait staff. The last time I visited Red Robin was on a Saturday night. Our waitress (cannot remember her name right now and it's driving me crazy) was very sweet and was sure to be attentive despite having to take care of so many tables. Having worked as a waitress through college I know how overwhelming a large section can be on a Saturday night. Our drinks arrived fast, the server was very knowledgeable about the menu, answering my sister's endless questions, and our food was served in a reasonable time frame for a Saturday night. My only complaint is that it took forever to get refills on the bottomless fries...to the point that I felt bad asking the waitress because I could see her standing in the kitchen asking the cooks for our fries and looking frustrated. She was very nice and apologized for the wait for fries, and was sure to stay on top of keeping those bottomless drinks coming in the meantime. My only other complaint is the clientele (yes I know that includes myself). This is where I really started to feel for my server. Like I said, I've worked in a restaurant so maybe I'm biased, but customers need to realize that the wait staff are people, not puppets. The people at the table next to us were extremely rude to our very sweet waitress for no reason. She was doing her job and doing it well.

253,Dorothy F.,"New York, NY",3,4,,5.0,2014-12-07,"I like burgers.  I like them a lot.  I eat them so often that I may turn into a cow one day.  I feel like I know what a good burger tastes like.  Red Robin knows how to make a GOOD burger.  I liked that the meat to bun to condiment ratio was perfectly proportional.  I personally don't enjoy having to dislocate my jaw to eat a ridiculously sized patty.  The guacamole bacon burger that I got was the optimal size.  I can't get over that meat to bun to condiment ratio thing.  PERFECTION.  The burger was juicy, flavorful and let's not forget about the BOTTOMLESS STEAK FRIES.  The fries were DELICIOUS.  They were not salted so you can decide how salty you like your fries.  I personally don't like any salt on them at all so this was, again, PERFECTION.  My friend got the crispy chicken burger and she really enjoyed it.  We enjoyed our meal so much that we barely spoke throughout the entire time (too busy stuffing our faces) and if you had ever met us you'd know that that's a real accomplishment.  Enough about the perfectly proportional food.  Let's talk about the service.  There were a LOT of people when we went.  We waited about 20-30 minutes which was fine because they had free balloons that we could play with.  I liked the balloons. Once we were seated our waitress came by in about 5 mins to take our drink orders.  Even though the place was really busy she made an effort to show that she was paying attention to us.  She was clearly harried but she made herself available while, simultaneously, addressing the concerns of the grumpy old couple to our left and the complaints of the woman with a baby who had spilled apple juice everywhere to our right.   In conclusion, very nice staff.  Very proportional food.  Very red balloons.  That's a recipe for success.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place?start=240,3.08,2.95,2.95,3.22,3.0020000000000007

I fell in love with the food on my first visit, and have been here to eat for my birthday for 2 years in a row. The atmosphere is fun and lively, the music isn't too loud, wait times are fair, and as long as you can tolerate the just AVERAGE to at times below average service, you will have a nice time.  First off, the food is EXCELLENT. Always fresh, always hot, always nice and tasty. The food quality gets an easy A+.... but now onto the negatives... While the wait-staff is just NICE enough, I have sensed a certain pompous nature with them on almost all of my visits. It's like these young hipster types think they're working at a 5-star Manhattan elite restaurant as opposed to a chain burger joint in the suburbs. I honestly felt like punching one of them in the face during one visit.  Common sense things like having bottomless fries yet not giving customers ketchup at the table occur often. Your waiter will disappear for elongated periods at a time without stopping by to ask how things are or if you need anything (if other restaurants can do this, why can't Red Robin?) And I have this hunch of a feeling that they wait staff is actually trained to **NOT** immediately bring the second helping of the ""bottomless fries"" feature that makes this restaurant so popular. Seriously, your second helping of fries, which are technically free, will have you waiting so long that you'll lose your appetite for them. I'm thinking this is done **PURPOSEFULLY** to psychologically deter people from ordering the second helping of fries so the joint doesn't have to spend as much on them. It only makes sense.  More patient types will enjoy the place better than those who aren't as patient and have less tolerance for annoying pet peeves. So if you are a patient type, go check it out, you'll likely have a nice time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place?start=140,3.32,3.17,3.17,2.54,3.23

I got in the restaurant and sat in the bar. I waited a couple minutes for the server, ordered my food and then waited, and waited. Finally she came back at about 25 min to tell me food was almost done... Then another 5-10 min after that it finally arrived.  I had a Royal Red Robin burger. Burger came out the exact way I ordered it! But the Garlic Parmesan fries were luke warm and not fully cooked. Plus for an extra dollar for garlic seasoning with no Parmesan cheese it wasn't everything I'd hoped for.  She came back about 1/2 into my burger to ask how everything was. I said, ""The fries..."" And she finished my sentence, ""Aren't cooked!"" I replied, ""Yep, can they remake them?"" Then I finished my burger and waited like 5-10 min for fries. They were good on arrival but at that point I wasn't even really into it at all. I ate them to be polite.  The only things I enjoyed were the milk shake I ordered at the end of the meal to drown my sorrows and the waitress for not being mean but honest and polite when I complained.

Long story short, we never got a refill on the ice tea or fries and when we finally got her attention we just paid the bill and left without ordering anything else.

57,Andrew D.,"Brooklyn, NY",34,63,149.0,4.0,2015-08-11,"So yeah, I've actually stumbled upon a Red Robin!! Yeah, that burger joint with the infectious jingle, yknow? ""Reddd Robbinn -- yumm!!!"" Yeah -- that jingle. Anyhow, now that that's out of my system I can start with my review. Ahem!    So while driving for work, I spotted one and and told myself I just had to go check it out. Upon entry I was greeted at the door and was then asked where I would prefer to sit. Being alone, I naturally opted for the bar. At the bar I was being greeted and serviced by a pleasant gentleman (yes, I forget his name). I proceeded to be the nerd I am and inquire a whole slew of questions regarding the establishment as a whole. Why aren't there more of these around and where is it originally based out of and that sort of thing. He was very nice and knowledgable when replying to all questions which I must say is quite impressive.    Fast forward. I scour the menu and to my surprise, albeit they specialize in burgers, never in my life have I seen such a menu. The menu so extensively dedicated to umpteen varieties of the hamburger. I loved it! Haha! I then become indecisive 'Drew and start asking nor questions even. I told him what I was into and all and we started to meet halfway until I stumbled upon the 'Burnin Love! With a name like that, I expected nothing but a salivating mouth with each bite I took. The 'Burnin Love is a burger topped with jalapeño coins, salsa, pepper-jack, lettuce, tomatoes, and chipotle on a cornmeal kaiser roll. Ironically enough one the menu its description is concluded with a concise, ""it's love at first bite"".    Boy oh boy was it just that! I loved every bite of it! Best of all, I tasted every single ingredient listed. That's cool to say when slot of times you eat something from a restaurant and you don't taste half of the ingredients they say are in the dish (for whatever reason). I loved Red Robbin and the cool act I forgot to mention is that they also offer beer pairings! That's right! Not wine, but beer pairings to go along with the burgers! I'm more of a water with lemon fellow when I go out, but this was certainly cool to know!   Although I've yet to go back to Red Robin, I will when I get the chance again! This is a great place for any real burger lover! Wash one of these bad boys down with a beer and you're on your way to heaven in a bun!

I enjoy how you can customize the food to your liking. That makes this place enjoyable. But let me tell you, the food is a hit or miss. The only thing that is consistent is the onion rings. The burgers are alright. Sometimes it is undercooked too much and sometimes it is overcooked to paper. The toppings and combinations of them are what makes thing place amazing.  Royal red robin with an egg and bacon is great. The banzai burger with pineapple and teriyaki sauce is my wife's favorite. A good balance between sweet and savory. The ghost fiery burger (not the tavern burger) is my favorite. It is spicy, but off balanced by the savory of the burger itself. I substitute the jalapeño bun for a ciabatta bun and it gives the hotness of the jalapeños a notch down. The jalapeño coins though are not that spicy to begin with. This place is good.

I requested my burger with just lettuce tomato grilled onion mushrooms and guar.  When it came it also was dripping with cheese.  I purposely did not request the cheese.  I was horrified. There was also mayo which I didn't request. I didn't bother sending it back but should have. As appetizer we had wings and kettle chips.  Wings were okay but the chips sucked.  They were cold and tasted funny.  We told the server and new chips were brought out again.  It was still cold and wet.  We also got the clam strip platter which was okay.  I should have just had the clams b/c the burger was a mess.   The waitress seemed overwhelmed and did not check up on us.  We went on a Sunday at 6 30- 8:00.  My sis said b/c of this experience she never wants to go back.  She stated that Shake Shack would have been much better.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place?start=120,2.88,3.12,3.12,2.6000000000000005,3.0240000000000005

110,Yesenia G.,"East Elmhurst, NY",21,49,112.0,3.0,2015-09-13,"First time at Red Robin was a fun experience with a couple of my girlfriends. Once arriving to the restaurant we were asked if we were all over the age of 21 in which we were, so we were seated upstairs in the bar area. The table was cozy and in a great location to watch baseball games which were playing on multiple flat screens. The ladies and I had a round of drinks and we also took advantage of our free refills and ordered separate drinks on there free refill menu. Our waitress was sweet & really made an effort to help us all with a burger choice. Since they were so many of us I won't go and say what we got individually, so I'll say what I ordered. I had a bbq burger with bacon, cheddar cheese, sweet bbq sauce (which was delicious btw), lettuce and mayo. The burger also comes with caramelized onions, but since I'm not a fan I had them removed. The girls and I were super happy with our orders and very much enjoyed the refills on our soft drinks and fries. Here's the problem, after we received our meal & some refills it was Incredibly difficult to find out waitress. When you arrive, on your table there is this tablet like accessory in which you can order your food, call the waitress from it, order dessert or drinks, even view your check & pay via card. So I'm assuming the waitress excepted us to use the tablet for anything we needed. Maybe I'm old fashion but I like the waitress coming over, just in case I have questions.  Here's when I get upset, once we finally got her to come over I ask her for our check, seriously it took her 23 mins to come back with our check! That's insane. I saw her doing other things which I really don't mind, but I also saw her laughing it up with her coworkers and at a point even looking around like she had forgotten something which in this case was my check. I was so upset, I ended up walking over to her as she was glazing at the stars and said can I please have my check again! She apologized gave me my check and took another 15 minutes to come pick it up from our table. That is the reason why I gave this Red Robin a 3 star review ! I don't mind the tablet you guys use to order or pay the bill but I do mind the lack of importance the waitress gave my party at the end of our dinner.

When I finally got connected a bartender, I placed the order and stressed that I have a peanut allergy. He read the order back to me and everything was correct. When I came to pick up the order, I realized why I had to wait so long when I called in. There was one bartender working behind the bar doing EVERYTHING, including serving drinks, answering phones, and running back and forth to the kitchen. They should have one or two people dedicated to manning the phones and taking orders.  When I checked my order upon arriving, the appetizer I ordered was wrong. Instead of giving me sweet potato fries like I asked for, they gave me jalapeno poppers.

Even other chains such as Applebees and Unos have thicker patties. They did cook a 'medium' burger right. The flavor is OK - not impressed, but it doesn't have me running back there. The plus is the touch pad they have on every table - you can place an order and/or pay your check without having to flag down a server.  The bottomless fries are a treat. Although they come unsalted (salt them yourself), the fries are warm with a good crisp, which makes them addicting. Grand Lux is across the street and their burgers are much better.

The desserts are really good, especially the Mud pie, although they cut the portion size. One thing i don't like is that if you want to substitute french fries for something else, they really overcharge you, unless it's a little salad of small dish of rotten fruit.

However, twice we have gone there to have our appetizers be forgotten about, or have the extra pickles I asked for with my burger delivered to another table right in front of me. Fine. Whatever. People make mistakes. However, the last time was the final straw for us. We put our names on the list, and stood to the side. We saw a table for two who had come in AFTER us (by like at least five minutes) get seated before us. When I pointed this out to the host, he looked at me like I was an idiot and said I must have given him a different name since I'm not on the list, even though he had repeated my name back to me! Sorry, as far as I know, I only have one first name. Even the other table agreed we had been there first. The host refused and sat them first and then finally gave us a table in the bar area....again. We had our order taken relatively quickly, only to have our appetizer come out first and be totally finished before the waiter realized he didn't bring us drinks.

6,Josh G.,"New Hyde Park, NY",242,458,4165.0,4.0,2016-11-05,"Okay, I promise not to reference the catchy jingle of this place even though it's fun to quote. But a restaurant should be much more than a little slogan. It needs to have good grub as well. Red Robin isn't anything close to grand (especially in the wide world of burgers), but last night's dinner was worthy of 3.5 stars (and a round up to four knowing I'll return).  The place used be a little too kitschy and almost childish, but more recently they've given themselves a facelift to portray a bit more of a contemporary adult vibe. There's still plenty of fun decor including burger-themed seats by the front entrance and a mural of colored baseballs creating a replica of the American Flag. They've also tried to put some focus on beer, which, in this growing craft brew world, is a smart move. Though this smart move is a bit more like a nice gesture as their craft beer listings aren't too vast. We'll chalk it up to a work-in-progress. Beyond drink, there's a decent selection of apps to start your meal with. We went for the onion ring tower. Clever in presentation and decent in taste with a few sauces for dipping accompanied on the side. The real reason you're probably coming is for the plethora of burger options RR serves up. I'll give them some serious credit in having a wide array of styles, toppings, and creative limited edition burgers on hand. That being said, the meat quality isn't anything mouthwatering. Their vaguely cooked-to-order (some pink or no pink) which is another nice gesture, though I'd prefer slight more attention to detail in the meat than having so many  topping options. But, when in Red Robin, do as the menu orders and get a burger loaded with goodies. Personal favorite (and choice last night) is the Burnin' Love burger (fried jalapeños, salsa, pepper-jack, lettuce, tomatoes and chipotle aioli on a jalapeño-cornmeal bun). Everything works well together to create some quality heat and fresh flavor.  Overall, Red Robin tries hard to reach a level of burger that other places reach with much more ease. They may not have the greatest beef, but they'll concoct a burger with a wonderful assortment of toppings. I'll return for that aspect and hopefully (with a little work) some beer as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place,3.0,3.04,2.908,2.6719999999999997,3.0240000000000005

95,Jen B.,"New Hyde Park, NY",3,19,1.0,1.0,2017-02-20,"Today was my second visit at a Red Robin location, and I was extremely disappointed.  When we walked in, there were several parties sitting in the waiting area.  We were told the wait would be about ten minutes which didn't seem long considering the amount of people sitting in that area.  As we were waiting, we saw at least eight tables that were empty but have yet been cleaned for at least five to ten minutes since the prior party had left.  When we sat, we looked over the menu and our waitress came over to take our food and beverage orders.  Our drinks took about 15 minutes before they arrived to the table which is very long for a few sodas and some waters. We had been then waiting thirty minutes till our server came up to the table to tell us that the food would still be a while longer.  She offered to bring out some fries for the table and we gladly accepted as we were starving.  The only problem is that she never did bring out the fries.  The manager was walking around and we called his attention to make him aware of the situation.  At this point we have been in the restaurant for an hour and have not had a bite of food.  I feel the manager was the largest problem in the establishment because he did not do well with customer service.  He was not very understanding and told us the food would be right out and they were putting it on plates, but even then it took a while.  When our food finally arrived, we still did not have any napkins or utensils on the table so we then had to wait for those which also took a long time.  The thing that I was most disappointed in was the fact that the manager never even came over to the table once after the food came out to see how everything was or if we needed anything else.  He was completely out of sight since the first time he came over to us.  The food was not very hot which questioned why it took so long.  I know Red Robin prides themselves in being ""bottomless"" for many things but even to get a refill of fruit which I am pretty sure came out of a can took about 15 minutes.  The food was definitely not worth the price we paid, as there are many amazing burger establishments nearby.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place?start=80,3.12,3.1,2.96,1.8280000000000003,3.1080000000000005

70,Paul S.,"Maspeth, NY",1,6,,4.0,2017-03-14,"My family recently dined here and I have to say the service has improved immeasurably in recent years, friendly and efficient. I suspect the improvement may possibly be a result of the survey you are asked to fill out after paying your check on their tabletop Ziosk device. Also, the wait time for your food to arrive (not the wait staff's fault, as I pointed out in my most recent review) has been reduced drastically. So all in all, a very enjoyable dining experience. Try their Classic Mini-Wedge salad. Delicious. You might want to share. It's more filling than it looks. We ordered two for our party of three and couldn't finish it all.

I had to spruce it up with ketchup even with all the toppings it came with. The pretzel bites tasted like yesterday's batch. Not warm, soft and savory.  The cod and shrimp entree were of low low quality, worst than high school cafeteria fare.  The Doh rings (combo of a croissant and a donut) were passable dipped in chocolate sauce.  The place is known for burgers so if you like burgers give them a chance.  The service was outstanding, very attentive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place?start=20,3.04,3.02,2.936,2.024,3.0280000000000005

As you can imagine, the place was packed with families enjoying a nice Sunday outing. Although is was packed I was seated within 5-10 minutes. The booth that me and my son were seated in was kind of small and at times uncomfortable but considering that seating was limited at the time I just stuck it out. It took a few minutes, but eventually the waiter came to the table to give us our menus. Our food took about 15 -20 minutes. My son got the turkey burger with salad, which he really seemed to enjoy. I got the salmon burger with salad as a side. The salmon burger was good. It was even topped with fried lemon pieces (which doesn't taste as bad as it sounds) and some type of citrus/chipotle sauce. The salad was just an average garden salad; it was great but it wasn't bad either.I also got the low calorie lemonade which was ok.

Here's the biggest problem here- there's no organization when it comes to waitstaff.  Nobody knows who has what table,  and that leads to tables being ignored (took awhile to get a server) and food was taken to the wrong table  (us) and others (i paid attention).   The bright star of the evening was our server,  Jimmy.  Hustling,  cheery young kid who did his job exceptionally well despite the chaos.   The food was disappointing.   Picky Pete got the smoked pepper burger. Bacon was thin and the burger wasn't seasoned.  This came in handy though because Picky Pete, Jr. ate half because her fried cod was not crispy at all and she deemed it inedible.  Decent flavor but the coating was practically steamed.   Teen is a great eater and demolished her bacon cheddar burger, minus the bacon because they forgot it.  My Burnin Love burger was a huge miss.  It was flavorless, overloaded with mealy mushy tomatoes, and it just wasn't good. I had also asked for a side of their pickled  jalapenos but didn't receive them.   The fries all around are mushy, limp and pale.  My garlic herb fries tasted like feet and no fries,  on any plate,  were hot. Despite what looked like cool options,  we skipped on dessert. Ambience is super cute, but with an open kitchen and burger centric menu, the dining area is loud with kids and kitchen noise.

They sat us by the bar at a high table...I'm not fussy, so whatever. The service was BAD. Everything was fine when we got sat and given menus. But the waitress/bartender asked us if we'd been there before-- we said no...then she explained the menu and offered us beverages. Okay, fine. But why did we get our waters 20 minute later?   Whatever, we forgot about it...now we are ready to order. She took our orders and this is where it just gets bad. We waited about 30+ minutes for our food. He ordered a medium burger and I have the 4 cheese grilled cheese.  We played virtual games on the table kiosk for 30 minutes or so...Our waters were done for a while, too. I'm starting to get antsy and upset. I told my BF to go to The bookstore before they close because he could have gone there and back and the food still wouldn't have come.  Just to play it safe, he didn't leave. The waitress comes and tells us that our food is on it's way out. We wait an additional 10 minutes. We finally get our food. Low and behold...my food was COLD. It was so cold that the bread had hardened. I tried to eat it because I was just so hungry. The bread was so hard it scraped my pallet. I just ate all the fries. The burger can be compared to a Burger King burger. We just wanted to get the heck out of there. Also, the stuff on the bottomless menu...is a JOKE. As soon as she put the broccoli down, it was gone in 2 seconds because there were only 4 in the bowl.   Like what the ACTUAL f*ck?!  She didn't come back until 20 minutes later when he was done with his sub par burger!  She gave him another 5 broccli!  I was so mad, I pressed the ""call a waitress"" button on the kiosk. She never came!  I had NO patience and thankfully, I remembered that you can pay through the kiosk. I paid and gave the lowest tip possible...15%. She didn't deserve that tip. I wasn't going to leave anything.  We just got up and left. What's worse...both of us ended up feeling sick after that meal. I'm NEVER going back there. I don't know how anyone goes there regularly.

About 30 minutes after ordering our burgers, we saw them placed on the pass and they sat there and sat there and sat there. After 10 minutes, we asked if we could have our food and we were advised that it wasn't ready just yet. 10 more minutes and the food was delivered. Surprisingly it was luke warm and only missing one item. We did ask for no mushrooms and surprise they were still on the burger. We paid our check on the little kiosk machine and surprise again, no receipt paper. We asked for a copy of the receipt but we gave up after the bartender who said, ""No problem.

Not long after that, our waitress came by and introduced herself and took our drink order. I ordered  a diet coke and my boyfriend ordered a strawberry lemonade. The drinks took a little while to come out, which was strange since we didn't order anything special. About ten minutes later, our waitress came back and took our entree order. We sat around waiting for awhile for our food to come out. What was even more odd is that customers who came in after we did got their food and were enjoying their meal, while we waited. Meanwhile our waitress never came back to update us on the status of our food. Maybe another 15-20 minutes goes by and the manager finally comes out and tells us that our food order was served to another customer and they had to remake our food. So we decided to wait, since we were told our food would be out shortly. Another 15 minutes goes by and we still didn't get our meal. I ended up tracking our waitress down to let her know we were leaving and we wanted to cancel our order and also to give us the check for the drinks that we ordered .

Surprisingly for a Friday night they were not busy at all and we were seated in a booth immediately. A sweet girl named Alana who ended up being our waitress and took our drink order. In the menu the domestic beers are advertised as $4.50 but when we ordered, Alana informed us that they're actually $5.50 which is no biggie but I am giving a 4 star rating because of that because they should update their menu prices. The drinks came out fairly quick and to our surprise they were served in huge glasses. The $5.50 was definitely worth it and no additional beverages were needed due to that. Red Robin's also has a cool kiosk system which for $1.99, we played unlimited games on (Trivia) and were able to make orders off of as well as pay.  There were so many burgers that I wanted to try but unfortunately I could only chose one so I went with the Buzz Mac & Cheese burger from the Tavern Menu and I opted for the signature patty rather than the double patty. For an additional $1.49, I was able to substitute regular fries for sweet potato fries. The burger patty was a decent size with a generous serving of mac & cheese, pepper jack cheese, lettuce and tomato on it. There was a ranch sauce that was on the burger which I could've done without but it was still very tasty. The bun was not soggy at all as I read in other reviews and the patty was  cooked just how I had ordered it. Although there were many things on the burger, you were still able to taste it all and everything meshed well together. My boyfriend ordered the Siracha Tavern burger which it looked like he enjoyed and was very well stacked with condiments, I almost regretted not ordering it. Once we were done eating, Alana came to check on us and then back again with the check. She was very on top of us without being annoying like most places trying to rush the customers out.  I'm happy that we decided to venture out to Long Island to try these burgers and will definitely be returning to try the rest.

59,Missy B.,"East Meadow, NY",0,22,,1.0,2017-07-13,"I'll focus on the food first.  My burger at over $11 was an average-sized patty on a bun with a slice of cheese and two scrawny bacon slices on it.  It's one of their specialty burgers that's supposed to have lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, onions, etc., on it.  When I pointed out this specialty burger wasn't special at all, the manager (who bused the burger to our table!) said why not.  I pointed out all the missing elements and he walked over to our waiter and he must have made a joke because the waiter glanced back at me and laughed.  I watched (kitchen was visible from my seat) as the manager slapped, literally slapped a piece of lettuce and a slice of dried up tomato onto my burger.  The manager brought it over and smirked, ""how's that?""  I was truly astonished.  The contempt of this guy was so obvious I asked my waiter what his deal was.  The waiter vanished after that, probably out of embarrassment, and we ended up not receiving parts of our meal and anything we did get was sloppy and unappetizing.  We sat and watched groups of customers come and go all the while asking for the bill and never saw our waiter again.  We've gone to Red Robin often and have noticed the quality of the food and the attentiveness of the wait staff going more and more downhill every time.  They have lost a customer for life.  No one should go out for a meal and feel intimidated or abused.  Shame on the manager and shame on Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place?start=60,2.28,2.87,2.928,2.052,2.6340000000000003

33,Grace T.,"Garden City, NY",127,40,37.0,4.0,2017-07-25,"I've been here a few times and I've always been greeted and seated right away. However, this time we waited a minute or two at the empty hostess podium. Then finally a young girl came up to us looking like she was scared or confused?  With that facial expression that was not exactly welcoming, she asked ""Can I help you?"" And we were like ""um table for two?"" Not sure if she was new or something but it was a kind of weird, awkward interaction. She  seemed to disappear again and the poor people who came in after us just started seating themselves. One thing I like about Red Robin's burgers is that they don't look like they are basic frozen patties that a lot of restaurants use. I also like my burgers medium rare and I was a little disappointed that it was more like well done. But that's not the end of the world. All the ingredients together tasted  really fresh. I also love that Red Robin has gluten free burger buns! I have always been quite the  burger connoisseur, but it is much harder now having a gluten intolerance. I am grateful for any place that either has a GF Bun option or a lettuce wrap, which Red Robin has both! My boyfriend is diabetic and can't do a lot of carbs so the lettuce wrap is great for him. Our server was super laid back and got our food out pretty fast. The manager as well was extremely courteous and came and checked on us a few times to make sure everything was satisfactory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place?start=20,2.24,2.88,2.936,,2.624

Our server Eric was helpful and attentive. The burgers were medium rare as requested. The onion rings and dipping sauces were bomb. There was a huge refill of fries for the kids meal. My son ate all 6 pcs of the meatballs. And they even gave him 2 red balloons on our way out (which he loves!). Overall a good experience and we'll be back again for sure. Update: went back recently and sad to say the experience wasn't a good one. Food took a looong time to come out and I think they were short staffed so our server looked unhappy and inattentive.

The hostess was very nice and found us a table quickly. I noted very quickly that many servers were sitting at a table chatting. I was a little put off by that because despite the fact that it wasn't super busy I didn't think it was appropriate to be hanging out at a table near people who were dining.  The server came over and took our drink orders while we looked over the menu. We both got happy hour drinks and she disappeared for a good 10-15 minutes. She didn't come back to check if we were ready to order. She eventually came back with the drinks and took our orders. The food came relatively quickly and hot. The burgers were very good and came with bottomless fries. The initial serving of fries that came with the burger was the size of what might come with a kids meal. It seemed like it was overlooked as the plate was put together. We had to flag down the server to get an additional serving.  Once we finished our meal we found out that we could pay through the computerized screen on the table. That was easy enough. I would try Red Robin again because the food was good.

ONE of them had, and after a few minutes, it was taken back and delivered to another table.  When the beers FINALLY came, the Blue Moon did not have a signature orange slice. The waitress said she would go get one.  She never did.  Our burgers came, they were OK, that's it.  I had approx 6 french fries, that were soggy, cool, and it was a mix of two different types of fries, which led me to believe that they were from other peoples returned plates.   We left there so completely disgusted, they should seriously consider closing their doors.

I don't believe in sending food back to the kitchen, but there was no way we were going to eat those onion rings. So I told the server they were cold, and of course the kitchen re drops the same onion rings. When they come back. They were hot. But now it just taste like old oil. Now my food comes. Chicken sandwich was good, fries were soggy. The fries at Red Robin are bottomless. I wanted more fries, but my server was nowhere to be found. Where my husband and I were sitting, if you look back you can see a reflection of what's going on in the server station, and the kitchen.

Started out with both a Very berry raspberry limeade and a Tropical Mai Tai. I always love the limeade so no issues there, the tropical mai tai wasn't bad. But it wasn't great either in my opinion. I just think they could've evened out the ratio of rum to sweetness a little better!  For an appetizer, I got the Jump starter double with jalapeño coins and mozzarella sticks! Delicious! The jalapeño coins are perfectly fried and the mozzarella sticks are nice and crispy, with a melty inside! I also got the pretzels which I have to say were amazing! Soft, not soggy and the cheese sauce was great! It also has a slight kick to it which I love!  Next, I got the Prime chophouse burger medium! When I received the burger, it was more on the well done side but it still was a good burger! Also, the bottomless fries are the best! Those fries are so addicting! The seasoning is also crazy good! Although it's not good for me, I dump it on the fries! No regrets!  Overall, I had a nice lunch today! Parking is a lot with plenty of spaces!

I assume this since both the meat and cheese were cold and looked dried out from preheating. Two scoops of guacamole & sour cream topped the dish with a few little cups of other ingredients (salsa & hot peppers) that you add yourself.  Once the dish was assembled it was TASTELESS.  Totally bland.  I asked the bartender if she had some hot sauce and she handed me a bottle tabasco sauce from the bar.  Guess I should have opted for the burger but I will never know since I will not be returning anytime soon.   Suggestion: Take your $10, go to Taco Bell, order 2 Nachos Bel Grandes add their ""Fire Sauce"" and enjoy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carle-place?start=20,2.56,2.78,2.952,,2.692
