I recently had their loaded baked potato soup, very good. Every time I go I order a root beer float and they're always good. Their new thing is the smokehouse burger which has mushrooms, garlic and fried onion strings on it. It was delish! But boy did I need a breath mint after wards. That was one of the best burgers I've ever had, nice and tender. My friends had an appetizer sampler that had fried zuccinni in it. I tried it and it was very good. I'll probably order it next time.

What's awesome is that they pay special attention to this fact when you ask for something gluten free. We often order Red Robin to go and get the burger as a lettuce wrap. In one of our first experiences the bartender actually proactively said, ""We'll make the french fries gluten free for you as well."" We knew ahead of time that the seasoning had gluten or traces of gluten in it, but for him to actually know his menu so well and anticipate our needs blew me away.

The hostess was nowhere to be found and we waited to be seated for several minutes. We were sat in the bar and had to wait for the bartender to make several tables drinks before she came over to get our drinks. Once we finally ordered we waited forever for our food.

The place looked pretty busy, but there was no one ahead of us waiting so we were pretty hopeful we could eat and get going to our next showing. We waited around 15 minutes for a table of 6, needing 2 high chairs for our younger children. After being seated we quickly made our choices so we would be ready when our server arrived. After about 15 minutes the table next to us had paid and left and around 4 or 5 servers had passed our table without even looking in our direction. Way to go team!! That is when we noticed the table across from us all had empty drinks and their menus still on the table in front of them.  We now had about an hour an 15 minutes to make it to our next showing and had not even placed our drink order. We gathered our things and left. The manager chased us down outside and apologized and offered to pay for our lunch if we came back, but we did not have time. She then offered to comp us a dinner if we came back at a later date. Doubt we will be back, with a family of 6 we cannot afford to waste our time even when we are not on a tight schedule.  Ended up eating lunch at Wendy's with four VERY unhappy children.

As for the rest of our experience, BLAH! Tonight after a twelve hour work day I brought my two young sons in as a treat. When we walked in the door there were five employees at the hostess stand, joking with each other. No one paid us attention for about two minutes. I shrugged it off as it is just after dinner rush on a Friday and they are probably just glad they survived. We were seated and given menus. Our waitress promptly took our drink and meal orders.  It then took about fifteen minutes for my kids to get their chocolate milk and orange juice, then another five for me to receive my diet soda, which arrived two minutes before my food. My kids of course sucked down their drinks and my five year old asked for another Orange Juice.  We did not receive his orange juice until the entire meal was finished and my other son had his food boxes up. I had to ask for a water for him so he at least had something to drink AFTER he was done his food. The waitress finally brought the drink and I requested a to go cup since we had been ready to leave for a bit and she told us to ""just take the cup, no one would care"" as a manager of a business, I was aghast. That is theft. I told her to just bring me a to go cup. She did. It was then fifteen minutes later, and she went past my table multiple times but never brought the check.

Always is when you're at bar seating.  I don't know why, but the Coke they serve is a little bit funky. I assume it's because the nozzle on the soda gun  at the bar doesn't get cleared as often as it should...? So today I tried a new burger.  The peppercorn A1 burger.  The peppercorn was a bit overwhelming IMO. The burger in general is always ehhh. I guess because it's such a big chain the burger will always be over done.  Bottomless fries are always a plus. Especially when they are the steak cut fries.  Obviously not the best burger ever. But it's a consistent chain.  Nevertheless the service at this location was prompt and friendly.

31,Megan S.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,4,,1.0,2016-08-05,"I recently moved to this area and I had family over seeing my new place. We decided to go to this location because it's two seconds away from me. We walked in and the hosts were sitting a large party. I walked up and put our name in. Couple mins later another family walked in, same amount of ppl as my party. About 10 mins later cuz they had sat two couple before us, they called the other ppls name. I went up and asked them why they weren't calling our name because we had been there first and I put my name down. Well apparently they didn't put my name down (as if we were sitting in their waiting room for no reason) and they apologized and said we were next. I was pretty mad at this point. Clearly we were there first. We were the only ones waiting at first. They clearly just ignored us and didn't care at all.  So after waiting like 30 mins to get a table we sat there for 10 mins waiting to be greeted. I'm a server so I was watching everyone.  Once my sever came up and greeted I had recognized her because she had passed by many times. As did the manager and never asked if we needed anything. We just got ignored again. Once she got our drinks I asked to see the manager. The manager NEVER came by although she walked by my table many times. Food was ok but I was so shitty I could barely enjoy it. The server was awful. I could tell she couldn't careless to serve us. We are a mixed family so I'm assuming she figured she wouldn't get a good tip. But regardless of being ignored at host stand, ignored by our server, and by the manager I still tipped her 20%. But never again will I step foot in that place again. I go out to eat to have a good time not to be disrespected my all the staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carmel-2?start=20,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68

9,Bryndon P.,"Carmel, IN",165,37,,5.0,2017-02-03,"I enjoy Red Robin, it's one of the few places that my wife can find gluten free fries. The burgers are usually really good too. We came to eat tonight and were greeted by Nick our server who was friendly and very attentive to the details of our order. I asked for their D.G.B. Burger, but I wanted to add the candied bacon they were featuring on other burgers to the D.G.B. burger I had chosen. Nick expressed his love of the candied bacon and thought this would be a great flavor combo. The food came out in a reasonable time for a busy Saturday night, but I quickly discovered that the bacon on my burger was not the candied bacon I had ordered but regular bacon. I alerted our server who sincerely apologized and made sure to notify the manager and get the right bacon to me. Nick is a big fan of the candied bacon and he loved my idea to add it to the D.G.B. Burger so he not only added it on the order but typed a separate message tot the kitchen to make sure it came out right, so he was disappointed that it hadn't come out the way he had sent it back to the kitchen. The bacon came out quickly along with the manager who apologized and discounted the meal. I added the candied bacon to the burger and OMG!!! The flavors together were incredible! This is one of the best burgers I've ever eaten, and I've been fortunate to eat at many excellent restaurants in my life. This burger was amazing. I was really impressed with the service, and I realize that not every experience at a restaurant, especially on a busy Saturday is going to be perfect, but I'm always impressed when the staff and management are quick to correct the problem with a positive attitude. Paul Foreman the manager, and Nick the server took great care of us, and we had a wonderful meal. My only regret was not waiting to get the candied bacon so I could eat the entire burger with those amazing sweet and savory flavors together. It was SO GOOD :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carmel-2,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72

The quality is decent, nothing super fancy by any means but also definitely no complaints. Very much your standard American burger joint feel.

We haven't been to Red Robin in ages and I can tell you we will never go back. The service was absolutely terrible and the food was cold. Burgers are the same as McDonalds and it took 20 minutes to get my daughters apple juice and almost 30 minutes to get napkins for the table after we asked at least 5 times. There were so many servers just standing around doing nothing. We will never be back. Sorry. Terrible experience,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carmel-2,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84

2,Nicole S.,"Indianapolis, IN",239,711,2588.0,3.0,2017-09-13,"Sigh. I kind of have to like Red Robin because they cater to families, and they know what families want. What we want are kids menus aimed at pre-readers with pictures of the food, so kids can point at what they want. We also want games and entertainment at the table so the kids will just be QUIET for ONE SINGLE MINUTE while the adults eat in peace. We also want kid-sized beverages. We also want quick service, so we can eat and get the heck out before someone has a meltdown. Red Robin has all these things and does all these things well, so it's a good place for families. The food is just OK. It's what you'd expect from a chain burger place. At this particular restaurant, there were tiny flies at our table that would not go away no matter how many times I swatted at them. That was a bummer, especially because they kept hanging around our food and my beer.  One nice touch is that when I ordered a kids hamburger with an extra plate (to split between two young kids), they automatically cut the burger in half without me having to ask. They also split up the fruit into separate cups. Nice! This is what I mean about it being family friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carmel-2,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005

I order a side of chili for the fries, which was cold and kind of nasty. Also, the order comes with a skimpy side of fries. Now, supposedly they have ""bottomless"" fries, but the server never showed up again after we ordered so no one ever offered us any.  The wife decided to order dessert on the electronic menu they have on the table. When it finally comes, the guy makes no effort to take the dirty meal dishes- instead, he kind of pushes them aside. We ask for silverware- since there were no spoons- and when he comes back I try to hand him my dirty dish and he makes a BLine and ignores us.

7,Alexis K.,"Bloomington, IN",123,14,1.0,2.0,2017-12-31,"Last Thursday was one of the most horrible experiences at Red Robin I've ever had and I would hope they would work to correct it. I called and made a to-go order at 5:15. They said it will about 15 minutes, so I took a little extra time and got gas and arrived about 5:45. I go to the bar (where they previously had you pickup to go orders) and a host standing talking to the bartender said if I went to the host stand she would assist me. So, assuming since someone acknowledged they WOULD help me, I walk over to the to go stand at the front and Wait. A manager, I believe, in glasses and had brown hair, and another young man seating guests and adding people to the wait list said to me numerous times, ""Have you been helped?"" And I said each time, ""Kind of. I'm waiting on a to-go order."" They just said ""okay"" and continued to help those who walked in the door. So it's now 6:15, 30 minutes after I arrived, and no one has acknowledged me or helped me with my order despite my many attempts to get assistance. What did get their attention finally at 6:30ish was that SOMEONE ELSE came in for their to go order and got theirs from that same manager lady, and had to tell her that I had been waiting long before she arrived. Then that manager looks at me after a few minutes of seating more people and says, ""excuse me, are you still waiting to be sat?"" And I'm livid at this point. I tell her no I am waiting for an order I placed AN HOUR AND 15 MINUTES ago that they informed me would take 15 minutes. She apologizes, goes back and grabs a bag that's been sitting their pretty much the entire time I've been there, and tells me it's on her. So yay, free food. But it's cold. Burger, cold. Fries, cold. The only reason I'm giving more than one star is because she didn't make me pay for the meals I ordered.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carmel-2,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004

The flavors really compliment each other, and it's not bland, nor does it try to be a ""fake"" burger. It's just delicious!

Since I've cleaned up my eating, my fried food intake has gone down significantly, but on a rare occasion, I will indulge. I don't regret this indulgence. I also enjoy RR's unsweetened iced tea, because it's not weak, like a lot of iced tea is at chain restaurants. Our server that night was a really cool guy, and I'm bummed that I blanked on his name, because he deserves a shout-out, for being knowledgeable about the menu, personable, and displayed impressive patience while having to deal with my dad!
