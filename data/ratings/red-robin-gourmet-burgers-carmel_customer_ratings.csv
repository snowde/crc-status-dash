First - was the Royal Red Robin burger (cooked medium of course) on a jalapeño-cornmeal kaiser roll.  (Seriously, the different buns make all the difference in the world).  Second - we had the Whiskey River BBQ on ciabatta bread.  We both had different sides, so we we could share (fries and onion rings).  It was so much food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carmel?start=20,3.0920000000000005,3.0920000000000005,3.0920000000000005,3.0920000000000005,3.092000000000001

35,Bethany S.,"Denver, CO",77,387,211.0,4.0,2012-03-13,"As a vegetarian, I wasn't too excited about going to Red Robin. A friend of mine was having a party here, and I asked if she'd considered Applebee's, which I knew had a few veggie options and healthier food. The website makes Red Robin look like it's one big hunk of meat mixed with some bread, cheese, and fried things with a big plastic bird to greet you before you consume it all shamefully. However, I discovered that they have veggie burgers (this is unusual at chain restaurants like this). You can replace any burger with a Gardenburger or Boca burger. I tried the Gardenburger on a patty melt, and it was actually good! Not excellent, but good enough to really surprise me. I also like the seasoning they offer for the delicious steak fries, and the service was excellent. I still wouldn't go out of my way to go here, but as far as chain restaurants go, I approve of this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carmel?start=20,2.9280000000000004,2.9280000000000004,2.9280000000000004,2.9280000000000004,2.928000000000001

They advertise themselves as a family restaurant. To me walking my grandkids by a huge bar doesn't really add up to a family restaurant.  Also my husband orders the piggy delight  aka bacon cheese burger, without cheese. They put cheese on it and ONE, I'll say it again, ONE scrawny piece of bacon. When you get more bacon on a bacon cheese burger at Burger King, than you do at the GOURMET burger joint something is obviously wrong.

Go for the upsell and say ""for just an additional 99 cents I can add some extra guacamole in there for you!"" And hook line sinker and fishing pole i would have bit because I lOOOOVE Guac!

We were seated immediately, even for a Saturday afternoon, wanted for nothing; she treated us like family and Tori made recommendations based upon our taste and answered all our questions with true enthusiasm and a smile!!!!!!!!   My husband was immediately sold on her recommendation of the Endless Root Beer float which Tori keep filled at all times along with my diet coke.  Her other recommendation were the Pretzel bits with beer cheese plus a beer mustard dipping sauce.  Excellent! Hope they keep this on the menu. My husband is the big burger fan, me not so much. I was pleasantly surprised seeing healthy options available. Numerous green salads, fruit salad, steamed broccoli, a Garden Burger, a BOCA Vegan Burger and my favorite I make at home often, a Sautéed 'Shroom Burger. Healthy IS possible here!!! if temptation doesn't overtake you. The Whiskey River BBQ Chicken was a huge, tender, juicy, delicious chicken sandwich with Whiskey River BBQ Sauce (YUM), cheese, crispy onion straws, lettuce, tomatoes and mayo. I substitute Pepper-Jack for Cheddar cheese and roasted green chile aioli for mayo.  Along with the endless garlic parmesan steak fries left me extremely full but looking forward to a return trip soon. My husband, being the hamburger truest, started with the ""Keep It Simple Burger"" before adding BBQ sauce or bacon or building upon. It's a fire grilled burger with lettuce, tomatoes, pickles & onions on the sided. He opted for bottomless steak fries instead of the optional freckled fruit salad. He thought it was a little dry but tasty and it appears their burgers are cooked well since we weren't ask how it should be cooked. Of course, we didn't ask either. Nothing some BBQ sauce or bacon couldn't help when he orders the next time. The bar area is simply the same as so many other restaurants i.e., Applebees, Outback. All have a bar area which is visible as you walk in but nicely separated and not offensive for children passing by and nice for the adults.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carmel,3.152,3.152,3.152,3.152,3.152

I hadn't been to RR in more than a year because, on the weekends, I don't usually feel like driving out to the 'burbs from downtown. We had reason to drive up Michigan Rd., though, so we stopped in for lunch. Despite it being nearly 1:30, the restaurant was full with more people arriving after we did. I was impressed with the ""new"" menu (like I said, it had been more than a year) as well as the presentation of the food. No more plastic baskets that were impossible to eat out of! The chicken sandwich I order is spectacularly messy and I always end up using a fork and knife to eat it. With the basket, food would get all over the place but the plate allowed for more maneuvering room. I'm not a fan of steak fries, so I think RR's fries are just ok.

For some reason, I've never had direct 'intents' on trying Red Robin, but we were right there, starving and who doesn't like to try a new burger?  The hostess that showed us to our seats had a funky cool blue color in her hair and she was pleasant and complimenting. It wasn't really a surprise to see the prices of the burgers because I think I've looked or at least glanced at the menu online before. We both opted to pass on the $14-$15 burgers and ordered some type of ""Tavern Burger"". It was a small double cheeseburger with bacon, some type of aoili and lettuce and tomato. Of course this came with the unlimited steak fries and I also ordered a Oreo milkshake. Fries: Good. The second order was piping hot so the seasonings were sticking to them well and they tasted better than the first round. The only problem was I only ate one of the second batch because I was full. I didn't mean for him to bring me a round. The fries are basic steak fries. The first batch weren't all the way done so it was a bit of a buzzkill, but they were ok...especially for unlimited. Shake: Pretty good. The presentation was fun and summer looking and while it could have been slowly sipped with a straw, I ate it with a spoon. I have no complaints. It was delicious.  Burger: I don't know what I expected with the burger, but it was great ! The seasonings were really good. I didn't add salt or anything to it. I ate as much as I could (it was very fulfilling) and then saved the rest for later. Later on, without heating it up, I bit into the burger was pleasantly surprised to find that it was still just as delicious AND the seasonings were popping with each bite even more. There was so much cheese slathered and melted all over it. No burger complaints.  Overall, decent experience.  Good birthday gift too (a whole free burger).

I don't get what the allure of this place is to kids, they talk about this place like it's been whispering to them at night on some unknown frequency. My kid would eat broccoli from here because, dammit, Red Robin has it in the menu ""so it's gotta be good."" If you want a place that will not disappoint you and your kids will LOVE because they're breaking some kid-code if they don't, then you'll be fine. Ask for server Caroline Bauserman, she's taken care of us twice and is singlehandedly responsible for me giving this location 4 instead of 2 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carmel,3.44,3.44,3.44,,3.4400000000000004

27,Tami R.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,33,2.0,2.0,2016-02-29,"Had a great burger there two years ago and we have kept giving them second chances. Don't know why they do not understand that a person might want all of their food and their drinks served at the same time, but it seems to escape them - actually not built into their processes at all. Have had the wrong food delivered two times out of five visits, have had our shakes either totally gone before food arrived or delivered after our food was gone. Only reason we got them on time yesterday was because we got kinda pushy about it. Not busy yesterday but it took a while to get seated and then the waiter didn't come over for 15 minutes - long after we had put our menus down and were looking bored. And always order your burgers one more level of 'done' than you normally do - otherwise, at this location anyway, they come out bloody and mooing. And ever since they renovated a year ago, sound bounces through more than it used to, so a screaming baby is shared by all. I SOOOO wish that Stacked Pickles had real milkshakes (or that BRU Burgers was in our neighborhood) - the real milkshake is the only thing that keeps us going here, because Stacked Pickles and BRU Burgers both have better burgers and much better/friendlier service (and BRU Burgers' milkshakes are bigger and better, their burgers better).  Maybe we will have to start making the drive to BRU Burgers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carmel?start=20,3.48,3.48,3.48,,3.4800000000000004

6,Real Friends X.,"Tinley Park, IL",67,53,27.0,5.0,2016-04-11,My coworkers haven't had too many good experiences at red robin lately. Something changed today though. We were greeted with the friendliest service ever. We had no issues with the waiter and our orders. We were served the greasiest appetizers and most perfect microwaved burgers I've ever tasted. We all had heartburn. My friend looked a little pale but I think he's okay. It was all in good fun. One suggestion I do have is that if you bring in your receipt to the doctor the restaurant should help pay a part of your medical bills! Our arteries aren't what they used to be :( I guess it's time to go,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carmel,3.48,3.48,3.48,,3.4800000000000004

4,Bryan C.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,11,,2.0,2017-05-20,"We ate at Red Robin this evening. I am still unimpressed with their food quality. The burgers are average in taste (I had the Southern burger) and very overpriced for such an average item. Truthfully, I have had better tasting burgers at Hardee's for half the price. The fries served with the burger were lukewarm. The refill order at least was hot, but still lacked the crispness and seasoning that one would expect. My wife had the 4 Cheese Melt. She said it was a little better than average, and she had the same complaint about the lukewarm fries that came with the sandwich.  It would seem that we may not patronize RR again. High prices for average food is really not what we are looking for in a restaurant.  On the plus side, our Server was excellent, very friendly and attentive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carmel,3.48,3.48,3.48,,3.4800000000000004
1,Hannah W.,"Las Vegas, NV",52,6,,1.0,2017-11-02,"Sorely disappointed.  My husband and I have been big Red Robin's fans for a long time. We have a once a month set date night for Red Robin (lately it has been take out). We moved to Indianapolis about 6 months ago and have tried this establishment about 7 times in that period. The first time or 2 wasn't bad, just a few forgotten things like requests for dipping sauces, etc. The next time was a full forgotten hamburger, which we had to turn around and go back for, the 4 times after that have been even worse. We order 2 burgers each time (1 for each of us) and not a single time in the last 4 visits have we gotten the burger we ordered. Tonight I ordered the southern charm, I got a patty with cheese and lettuce. Nothing else. No bacon, onion, sauce, etc. It was bland and nasty. That is just one example of the many, horrendously wrong orders we have received.  Although we have been long time fans, it's time to find a new place.  I wouldn't recommend unless you like wasting your money on food that you didn't order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-carmel,3.32,3.32,3.32,,3.3200000000000003
3,Craig K.,"Zionsville, IN",1,100,4.0,2.0,2017-11-14,"The premium burgers are way overpriced and the food is good at best, not great. It is certainly not worth the premium price they charge for some of their items. They are nowhere near a $10+ burger place and their sides are fine but nothing special. The service is usually not very good at this location with tonight being no exception. Maybe we needed to use the goofy iPad thing to call them but I'm a believer in people paying attention to their customers. I have given this place several visits and have always left disappointed. In the last few years, I haven't once taken advantage of the free food offers they send me which is very telling.

We waited for someone to come to the table and finally he came by our table at 725 pm. After he had walked by our table several times. No one even asked had anyone come to our table..... The food was cold... We weren't given and once it was brought out she was touching it and placed it on out plates were our cold food was....
