I started going to Red Robin in MD because one of my dear friends worked there and not I go to Red Robin because it seems to be a very work-team-luncheon-friendly place. I'm not a huge fan of their burgers, since it's not the best quality. However, I really like how you can lettuce wrap your burgers. As someone who has never enjoyed a huge bun with my burgers, this is a great alternative for me.  Their fries go REALLLLLLY well with buffalo sauce and ranch. You have to try it.  If you get on their Red Robin royal customer program, you can get a free burgers on your bday month. When you acivate your program card, you get a free appetizer. I recommend the onion ring tower.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cary?start=40,2.8920000000000003,2.8920000000000003,2.8920000000000003,2.8920000000000003,2.892000000000001
50,Lyndsay L.,"Raleigh, NC",294,7,,4.0,2012-04-14,"My boyfriend & I actually frequent this place often since he is a huge fan of their burgers. We enjoy it there quite a bit. We've always had great servers who are very friendly and efficient. My biggest issue is the bar for it seems to take them 10-15 minutes just to get a beer. There have certainly been times when we order a quick beer at the start of the meal and it comes out to us maybe 5 minutes before the food does. Other than that, they are pretty quick with everything else & the food is usually pretty good. The atmosphere on some nights if you don't have children can be absolutely nuts!!

54,Matt B.,"Snohomish, WA",36,396,16.0,3.0,2012-05-18,"It always seems weird rating huge chains like this, but here I go... Burger was good, but nothing super amazing I'd tell people about. Beer and drinks are pretty expensive, and there isn't a good selection. Service was rather slow in getting there, but once he got there, he was awesome. Unlimited fries are always awesome, and you can find condiments they don't put out (e.g., malt vinegar) if you ask). Really, though, it's a Red Robin. You get about the same experience here that you get at any of their other 19876496461 locations. You come here for consistency in food, not the awesomeness.

The service tends to be hit or miss, especially if you are a table of two seated in the 'bar area'. We have found on numerous occasions, the bartender cannot balance making drinks for the whole restaurant, and taking orders/refills/service etc. This is most likely a management decision - to overwork the bartender, but it is consistently frustrating.

There is no reason to wait 45min for food.  No one came to check on us, most RR locations will bring you out a fry fill if they know ur food will be longer than a half hour.

53,Adnan C.,"Raleigh, NC",13,31,3.0,3.0,2012-07-09,"I am kinda underwhelmed. I love burgers, and I did not expect that a burger chain like Red Robin would make an inferior burger than IHOP. I ordered the Bleu Ribbon burger, with double patty. Comes topped with bleu cheese-lettuce-tomato, bbq sauce, chipotle mayo and with loads of crispy onion. With a combo like that, I expected lots of flavor, but strangely, it lacked. As someone else has put it ""whole lot of tasteless-ness"". The only noticeable taste was a tangy bbq sauce, thats about it. The meat patty was not exacltly dry, but not juicy either. And,  the amount of crispy-onion was too much. Bun was ok, toasted, and held pretty good against the double patty.   The steak fries were good, the sweet tea was on par with Mcdonalds. (That said, the Mcdonalds on Western Blvd makes a pretty decent sweet tea). The decor was nice, service was very good, full marks for that. Food was 2 star, service and decor, 4 star.

The burger itself was fine.  Nothing  to write home about, but good; as I would expect from a place like Red Robin.   I eat here because I know that the food will be consistent; not great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cary?start=60,2.9560000000000004,2.9560000000000004,2.9560000000000004,2.9560000000000004,2.9560000000000004
48,Christine G.,"Kill Devil Hills, NC",12,125,,2.0,2012-11-01,"I really didn't want to give this place only two stars. I've been to the one at Brier Creek and never had any issues. This particular location has its work cut out for it. I went with four coworkers today for lunch. The hostess sat us at a corner table. However, it was pretty obvious that we were sitting in no one's station. One waitress came by after a few minutes and took drink orders; finally, the manager came by and took our orders. This was about 15 minutes after we sat down; if I had been with my fiance, we would have left. I don't have the patience to sit around at restaurants. It's not like it was all that busy in there to warrant the wait...lots of empty tables at the lunch hour.  I looked at their online menu before even entering the place; I used to eat here more often before I gave up meat. Now, it seems sort of silly to go somewhere where the main attraction is hamburgers if you don't eat meat. But I checked the menu and had decided before I got there that I would get the hummus plate. However, I found out they offered a Boca vegan Gardenburger, so I ordered that and a side salad. The gardenburger was completely bland. I should have stuck with the hummus plate. I was underwhelmed. Apparently, based on other reviews, the bland thing is not contained to the gardenburger...should have checked here before agreeing to go to Red Robin!  Between the mediocre burger and the mediocre service (the manager wound up waiting on us most of the time), this is not a place I would put into general lunch rotation.

69,Tim K.,"Cary, NC",0,13,,3.0,2013-02-13,This is one of those hit and miss places. Sometimes you come in and the hamburgers and fries are just fabulous and other nights the buns are cold and hard and the fries appear to have been under the light for some time. Service is usually good though in some instances the waiter/waitress is gone for some time due to the load they have. Also sometimes it takes some time to see tables cleaned during non-peak time. They actually appear to be more efficient during rush hours then the non-peak hours. Might be the people working at that time. The best during the time most needed.

I ordered the Whiskey BBQ burger and it arrived missing the essential crispy onion straws and barely enough BBQ sauce to taste. It was replaced but wondered what the point of the burger was without those two ingredients. Am I picky? My lunch companion ordered the  French dip sandwich. It was awfully small for 12.79 and the crisp French baguette was more like a grocery store deli roll. Impressive? Not to us. Really I seldom go out for a burger, and if I do, I want to LOVE it. Makes me feel like Miss Piggy, but I want A Do-Over; wasted calories and wasted money. Am I cheap too?  2.79 for one medium size soda. So, bill with 20% tip was $35 for 1 burger meal, the French dip thing and one fountain drink. Also the manager was asking some of the tables 10 or 12 questions about their meal seemed a little annoying and grilling. Now, I'm unfriendly too. We left and thought, we would rather have chick fil-a, fast food, really.  Bottom line- I can't see any reason to eat here again. 3 stars, feeling generous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cary?start=60,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004

Very nice menu with lots of options - including chicken and fish ""burgers"" if you can still call them that. I settled on the Bacon Cheeseburger with fries. They have an ""endless fries"" promotion, and when your burger comes out they give you literally 10, perhaps 12, fries. I thought this was rather cheesy and in poor taste. However, the good news is that they will bring you more at no charge...and when they do it is a full basket of fries. This does somewhat redeem them of the obvious attempt on their part to control costs at the expense of looking ""cheap"" to their patrons. However, since they are advertising ""endless fries"" the first serving should be more than a literal handful.

33,Stephanie R.,"Raleigh, NC",1,7,1.0,4.0,2015-08-28,"My family and I visited Red Robin last Wednesday. We had three kids under 6 with us so we thought this would be the perfect place to quickly get in-and-out in a child-friendly environment. We were right! With a total of 7 people we were sat at a large booth with a high chair for the littlest member. Our server Jason was great. He was extremely personable, quick and very attentive to our table. He was great with the kids. One of them cried because we ran out of fries and Jason was super quick to bring more fries over! We ordered the onion ring appetizer and the onions were crisp, hot and the campfire sauce was delicious. I ordered the ghost pepper sauce tavern double burger and WHEW, it was SPICY! I love spicy things and I am glad I ordered this burger, but be warned, it is not for the faint of heart! Hello fresh jalapenos! I haven't been to Red Robin in several years but I was excited to see that they still had bottomless fries! I had three baskets (don't judge) with their delicious poppy seed honey mustard for dipping. OM NOM NOM.  I like the new atmosphere at this location - seems very hip. That being said, the beer selection is quite disappointing - boo! Get some local craft beers on tap.... besides Red Oak. With all the local breweries in the RDU area, there's just no excuse for crap beer. Also, I've never been a huge fan of the kiosks at the table, but kudos to RR for trying to keep up with the changin' times. I didn't use it other than to pay my bill.

16,Scott S.,"Greensboro, NC",19,92,337.0,2.0,2015-08-30,"Red Robin has been a love-hate thing for me for many years. Depending on the restaurant, the experience could be great or it could be awful. Unfortunately, for this location, it falls into the ""awful"" category.  No secret that this is a chain burger restaurant that I would lump in with places like Chili's, Applebees, O'Charleys and TGI Fridays. Some of these National chain restaurants that were all much better back in the day say about 26 years ago. It's amazing to me that places like these manage to stay open for as long as they do. Who would have thought that places like Chili's and Applebee's would have made it through all these years. No issues with the service really. The biggest and one of the worst experiences I have had was that we found a big chunk of plastic wrapper from the cheese slice in one of the burgers we ordered!  The manager was polite and made us a new replacement burger. She also did not charge for the burger which I thought was a good thing The quality level of the food was just meh and definitely not on par with some of the better independent burger places . I could get the same burger at a fast food chain that would be just as good, if not better for half the cost.  I've got nothing against chain restaurants as long as they are done right.

It was obvious that our order had been left sitting. My partner only received part of his order. No check backs to see if everything was ok. Not until we had almost finished eating did Alex come by to say that the missing chips had ""just been dropped"" and once again disappeared. He only returned when he saw me touching the ziosk. I was so angry when he asked what he could get I said the manager, he smiled, laughed and said ok. The manager returned with very over cooked chips (the missing part of the order) there was a half hearted apology and the excuse that he had been in the back cooking--this was an obvious untruth as we watched him circulating throughout the dining room.

28,Blair C.,"High Point, NC",58,1,,1.0,2016-06-27,"I went to Red Robyn today and was reminded of why I do not eat there often. It started by waiting for 15 minutes for the waiter to even take our drink order. When a mixed beverage was delivered the server commented that the smell of the drink was ""going to make me puke."" That shouldn't be said to anyone from a server. The appetizer arrived without any fanfare. Then the waiter admitted he had forgotten to put our order in for the kitchen. They brought another friend her milkshake, which she had specifically asked for no whipped cream, it was covered in a huge amount of whipped cream. When our food finally did arrive mine was wrong so it was taken back to be fixed. As my friend was eating her burger she found a black hair on her tomato (she doesn't have black hair). That was taken and replaced when they brought my food. When we went to pay there were no aceptions taken. I asked to see the manager and the waiter came back and said my friends burger was taken off. I once again told the waiter that I actually wanted to see the manager. Then the manager came, I gave him a run down of everything that had happened. He took another $3.50 off a $60 bill. We went to pay again and we couldn't because the table tablet wouldn't let us split the check. We ask the waiter to split the check for us and when he did it took the discount off. Once again the manager had to be called. He split the check and we paid and left. I have never been anywhere where more went wrong and less was done to ""fix"" the problems that happened. I have had better burgers cheaper at many many restaurants.
