27,Hugh P.,"Jacksonville, FL",1273,226,1751.0,4.0,2013-06-14,I like the Royal Burger and the atomsphere at Red Robin. The milk shakes are excellent! And even though I don't drink you can get a adult drink here. The staff is always friendly and the restaurant kept clean. f you just want to relax and grab some food this is a great choice. Waiting on more location in Florida such as Jacksonville.

34,Becky M.,"Chambersburg, PA",1,9,,3.0,2015-02-03,"The food is good. Haven't had a bad burger here yet. Service can be a hit or miss but overall not too bad. We've occasionally gotten a rude or indifferent server but not bad enough to keep is from coming back. My biggest reservation about this place is the price, mostly with the appetizers. Thank goodness they started to offer the smaller portions otherwise I would go bankrupt. For the short stack of onion rings it's $5, for the full order it's nearly $10. That is RIDICULOUS for onion rings. They do taste good, but not worth $10. It's the occasional date for us here because of the cost.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chambersburg,,,,,
29,Willow L.,"Fayetteville, PA",0,146,129.0,5.0,2015-02-07,"The Red Robin in Chambersburg always delivers a wonderful burger.  Service is sometimes a bit slow, but I don't mind as long as I have a cold beer. Speaking of beer, their beer prices are outrageous, but what can you do? I've tried several burgers and they're all good.  The meat is always tender, no full of gristle, and cooked to perfection.  Well done but never dry.  If you get a burger with bacon, the bacon is pretty darn good.  Not too fatty, not too thick and not paper-thin.  Burgers with the onion straws are a bit greasy, but taste amazing.   You'll likely have to wait if you go on a Saturday evening.  We try to go around 4:30-5:00 to avoid a long wait. The Ziosk allows you to pay at the table without the need of the server.  You can use your credit card or a gift card right there.  Some people may not find this to be very secure, but I think you can request the server swipe your card, or just bring cash. This really is a great place to go for an awesome burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chambersburg,,,,,

6,Telp R.,"Mercersburg, PA",0,3,,1.0,2015-09-02,"I can honestly say that EVERY time I have been here they have messed up our order. Today was no exception. I had called ahead to ""preorder"" our food as this was literally over a lunch ""hour"" and this would save time. I had the preprinted menu that is on their website in my hand. I called the phone number provided via Google. I was prompted with an automated woman telling me to ""Press 1 for carry out, press 2 to speak with the restaurant staff."" I pressed 2 and was told, ""I'm sorry, that option does not exist."" Um....okaaaay. So I pressed 1. I spoke with staff and made it very clear that we were dining in, just preordering to save time. I called at 11:30 for a 12:10 arrival time. We ordered an Apple Harvest chicken salad, a 1/2 soup and salad with French onion soup and spinach artichoke dip as an appetizer. We arrived at 12:10. The dining room might have had 6 tables full. The host wound us around the entire restaurant to seat us at a table in the back. A DIRTY table. As I'm looking around at the 20 CLEAN tables around us, I'm like, seriously?? He says, ""Is this okay?"" As I look at him, again like, seriously? He says, ""Well, I'll come back and wipe it off."" Yeah, clever boy. Then our waiter arrives. I tell him that we preordered our food. he says, ""You did?"" No, I'm lying.. He comes back with the spinach dip. No plates, no silverware, no napkins. Didn't take our drink order. There were 10 pieces of celery, about 50 chips and about 1/2 cup of dip. It was tasty, but for $8? Tad pricey. And had 2 huge chunks of artichoke in it. I can say that I have never had to cut my dip before.. Then our food arrives. The soup was stone cold and one salad was completely incorrect. I looked at the salad and said, ""This doesn't look like the Apple Harvest chicken salad."" To which the waiter brightly states, ""What doesn't?"" Um...the Mars rover... or, perhaps, THE SALAD IN FRONT OF ME. He trots off and a female manager appears. She tells us that they don't even make that salad anymore and ""It was his mistake"", referring to the person who took my order. She asked me if she ""could make me something else real quick"", which I appreciated, but the entire reason for preordering was that we were on a time frame. I didn't have 15 minutes for her to make me a new meal. We were about 3 minutes into eating the food we were presented when the waiter appears again, now he has our bill in I his hand. He says they took off 10%. 10%?? How about COMPING my WRONG FOOD ORDER??? And since he brought us the bill, I guess we weren't invited to have coffee or dessert. We will NOT be back...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chambersburg?start=20,,,,,

Well, while waiting for a seat a server (Domineque I believe it's spelled) treated some of her co-wokers like they were crap! We were seated and ordered our food.  The same girl served our food and asked us who had the ""mushroom sandwich"". we looked at each other and my Aunt asked if it was the mushroom swiss burger to which Miss D replied ""It's the only one here with mushrooms"".  We ate our food and I addressed Miss D's attitude with the manager on duty and I hope Miss D cleans up her attitude.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chambersburg,,,,,

28,Trish M.,"Chambersburg, PA",33,3,,1.0,2016-04-16,We went for my son's birthday. I brought 12 people and it's the first bad experience I've ever had at Red Robin. We had 2 broken soda glasses on 2 separate occasions. The soda carbonation was way off and not drinkable. The top shelf margaritas tasted like they hardly any alcohol in them. My sons order wasn't put in and so he got his food about 10 minutes after everyone else's and no compensation for any of this. The nachos were good. I called the manager and she returned my call and offered a $10 gift card. That's not really comparable to what I spent and what we experienced but at least she tried. I'm not sure I'll go back again to use the gift card.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chambersburg,3.76,3.76,3.76,,3.76

25,J S.,"East Stroudsburg, PA",0,8,,1.0,2016-06-10,"Food and service was good... However the attitude of the manager on duty was disheartening. Generally speaking, I'm not the pickiest eater on the planet, however Iam conscious about what, and where, the food I eat comes from. I asked our waitress about the origin of the cod they had on the menu (bear in mind on the menu it is listed as ""Arctic Cod""), to which point the manager came out with the box to show us. Listed on the side was ""imported from China"". This is an immediate red flag for me due to the lack of food safety and contaminants known in the Chinese farm raised fish industry.... I'm sorry but chowing down on fish that is fed human excrement and has high levels of other contaminants is not my idea of a good meal. Not to mention, the false advertising aspects. At any rate, after the manager left. We noticed her laughing about us and making gestures about us.

I felt like it over promised and under delivered. Why the 2 stars.....it is a poor value. We had 4 burgers and a kids chicken strips meal. We had 2 lemonades and 2 soda's. The bill with tip.....$101.00. To be fair that included a $5 donation that they came to our table to solicit for a cancer fund drive.  Oh and a $1.99 charge for the kids to use on table thing.

Sure, they have salads here and you can get fruit instead of fries. But... burgers. So I compromised and went with the simple chicken burger, which was a grilled chicken breast with LTO and pickles. Yes, I had the steak fries and while they're refillable upon request, I opted not to. The chicken was great. Not dry and rather tasty with the toppings. The fries were excellent and I added some of the Red Robin special salt to them. Yum. I don't feel guilty at all. Service was good. No waiting for the check - they have one of the table kiosk things where you can pay when you're ready. Easy! Lots of sports channels. I was a little bummed that one was showing a hunting television show. I don't need that while I'm eating, but I managed to get the lamp in my line of sight and it was done.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chambersburg,3.52,3.52,3.52,,3.5200000000000005

18,Ryan S.,"Cashtown-McKnightstown, PA",0,14,,1.0,2017-12-24,"Well, I returned back for my second (and LAST) time at the Chambersburg Red Robin. My first time was about a year ago.... my party had a bad experience and reported it to corporate, who in turn had the store manager, Betsy, call me to apologize and offer complimentary gift cards in order for us to give them a second chance (she forgot to send the cards BTW for about a month!)  At any rate, we decided to give The Red Robin managed by Betsey another chance..... and I regret it thoroughly. Please bear in mind, I'm not the hardest person to please, and writing negative reviews is not something I do unless something extraordinary bad. Considering how empty the restaurant was, there should have been no excuse for our poor service and sub-par food. We were rushed to order by our waitress (can't remember her name.... dark hair, had a tattoo on the inside of her upper right arm, had a worn ""X"" sharpied on her hand indicating she must have been out the night before partying).... we went ahead and ordered their appetizer of chips, guacamole, and salsa... what arrived what shockingly sparse.... I have seen airlines offer larger portions. One small (as in carry out dipping sauce container sized.... about two three tablespoons) container of guacamole, another tiny container of salsa with a tiny bowl that maybe had about twelve tortillas in it. All that for $5. That was just laughable. Onto the second course: we ordered burgers with fries, and were offered a number of their dipping sauces which we were told were free of charge. Many of the flavors seemed interesting and we each asked for three different varieties. Our burgers came and they were rather small for what you would have expected for a $15 hamburger (smaller than I remembered in the past).... they were rather flavorless, the buns seemed not very fresh, and overall it was just ""messy"". Nothing we received looked as advertised. We also received only one of the different sauces we asked for (and those were wrong) I asked for steak sauce and napkins (we only had one on the table since we were seated) the waitress returned after a lengthy delay with three napkins and an empty bottle of steak sauce. WTF. I waited patiently for her to return (which she did not for over twenty minutes) allowing my wife to enjoy her meal while I waited..... as my burger was nearly fully cold, I decided to just eat it. Finally after about 25 minutes since she dropped off the food she returned... asking for more fries (we each received about TEN each initially), she kept asking if we just wanted to split one order.... finally she got it straight and returned with our fries.... my order had a whopping NINE fries on the plate. It was like pulling teeth to get her to come back... Our bill was almost $49.... for a iced tea, two hamburgers, and a $5 miniature airline portion of chips and guacamole/salsa. We were charged for about 6 of the ""FREE"" dipping sauces (at 75 cents each) even though we only received 4 of them after having had asked about four times! How can they charge $50 for dinner for two at a hamburger joint with crappy food and service? Thoroughly disgusting. What a fall from grace! Incredibly overpriced for (mostly) frozen ingredients that cost pennies on the dollar they charge! Even with the complimentary $30 gift card we had from our previous bad visit.... this wasn't nearly worth the remaining $18 we had to pay (plus tip.... she wasn't the most attentive waitress, but she meant well).  Strike Two. I don't need to give it a third shot.  Sayonara, Red Robin! Don't be so stingy! Update: after all this time, no upper management from Red Robin has attempted to right this wrong!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chambersburg,3.2,3.2,3.2,,3.2000000000000006
