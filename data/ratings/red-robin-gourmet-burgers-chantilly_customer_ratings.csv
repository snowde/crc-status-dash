63,Bonnie C.,"Culpeper, VA",54,219,1.0,3.0,2012-10-17,"Last night found us in the Chantilly area around 8:30 p.m. & hungry for something good, yet quick.  ""Red Robin"" loomed up, & since neither of us had ever been to this chain before, decided to give it a try.  It was 8:30 p.m. on a Tuesday night, so guess not too surprising that except for one other table, we were the only patrons.  Husband just ordered water; I an iced tea ($2.59 with free refills) - both of which were brought promptly. Hubby ordered the ""Turkey Burger"" ($8.99 + $.99 for American Cheese).  While I'd like to quibble over the extra $.99 charge for a slice or two of American Cheese, hubby's burger was a nice thick obviously hand-formed burger, perfectly cooked.  I ordered the ""Patty Melt"", which was wonderful.  Perfectly cooked to ""medium"" burger & perfectly formed to fit on the wonderful fresh thick lightly-toasted Marble-Rye bread slices.  Burger was sandwiched between 2 slices of American Cheese & topped with a layer of perfectly sautéed sweet onions.  House-made Thousand Island Dressing was served in a decent-sized container on the side to add as one wished. Both of our orders came with their ""Endless Fries"", but frankly I'd be surprised if anyone outside of maybe children bother to ask for 2nds.  Fries are of the thick-cut ""steak fry"" variety, & in this case - as in 9 times out of 10 other places that serve this type - were hot enough temp-wise, but weren't crisp at all.  Floppy/soggy.  No wonder they offer them ""endlessly"" - probably can't get rid of them any other way - lol!   Of course, I'm a hardcore ""shoestring"" potato fry fan, so perhaps it's just personal preference rearing its ugly head.  But then, soggy is soggy. Service was excellent - prompt, friendly without being intrusive - exactly what restaurant service should be.  Bill after tax but before tip (which was generous) came to $22.64.  A definite bargain for the quality of the food. Bottom line - nice place for a casual well-prepared burger or sandwich (they offer veggie burger/sandwich options as well).  We'll definitely add this chain to our list of places worth visiting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chantilly?start=60,3.36,3.36,3.36,2.54,3.3600000000000003

91,Greg M.,"South Riding, VA",70,215,,3.0,2013-03-06,"Red Robin offers great burgers, fries and service.  Usually busy, make sure you avoid the obvious times if you are out with kids.   The service is always friendly; I've never had a problem there.  The décor is the same as always at all RRs for the last 20 years. Oriented towards kids but with great food, this copy of Red Robin has its act down.  It is efficient and has the recipes down pat.  The burgers are done to order and all the times I've asked for customizations I've never been turned down - so get what you want.  They're careful not to over-cook the burgers so don't over-compensate in your order.  Order whatever you want as your own creation or order one of their set burgers.  My very favorite is their teriyaki burger (strange that the only decent teriyaki sauce on the east coast is here - goes back to their west coast heritage).  It's easy to eat healthier here with their lighter options.  Their steak fries are just about as good as it gets - ask for some dips and try their house seasoning salt.  Two minor points of concern:  first - you can ask for garlic fries, but it seems spotty as far as when they're done well or not - I've had them pretty greasy before at this location so be prepared for that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chantilly?start=80,3.36,3.36,3.36,2.476,3.3600000000000003

We had a surprise birthday party for 20 on a friday evening and the whole thing went off superbly well thanks to the wonderful staff. Our server, Andrew, was impeccable and provided prompt and courteous service the entire evening, making sure that everything was taken cared for. The only downside was that I had to arrive 30 minutes earlier to hold a table for a large group, since they don't take reservations. But all in all, I appreciate the work they took to make sure that the event went off with a hitch. I highly recommend this place for parties/gatherings.

The parking lot was packed; it was lunch time, so I knew the inside was bound to be a mad house.  They were packed, like... we got the last table packed. The server was prompt and had our drinks for us immediately.  We had an 18 month old with us and she quickly had the children's menu there so we could get his lunch ordered first. The service was good.  Order was taken correctly and our drinks stayed full.  That is leaps and bounds above Manassas already. I ordered the Bonzi Burger.  It was yummy and done exactly the way I wanted. Pro's... they stopped wrapping the burgers in that white paper.  I was never a fan of that.   It served no purpose and just got in the way.  Glad my food just comes on a plate now instead of a ""to go"" wrapper in a plastic basket. Con's... not really a con, just annoying... the fries, they are amazing!  And they give you like eight of them with your burger.  I know they are bottomless, but I don't want to have to sit and wait 12 minutes for more.  Put some damn fries on the plate! I want my food at one time, and eight fries next to my burger is just a tease.

When they were wrapped up, they were so easy to eat. Now they arrived on a plate, with a small cup of fries. They are messing to eat. A side note on our last visit, they couldn't serve any draft beer. Apparently they ran out of CO2 or something that was required to serve beer. That was a bummer. Odd.

Of all the eateries out there including the dreaded Olive Garden or Red Lobster ( dirty rachet lobster) they insisted on this place. Usually I have bad memories of RR, no matter where I go, so here I was expecting worse. Much to my surprise, the employees were all sane, happy and actually working and not waiting for their Iphones to flash. So we get seated, they we get our waiter, who was nice, gets our drinks fast. We ordered wings and chips...by all means, just get wings by itself do not eat those nasty $1.00 walmart type chips...

I give this place 4 stars for the food, 5 stars for our waiter, he was on point. refills without being asked, napkins, hauling our dirty dishes as we eat, just on point with everything. we had an issue with our bill and the lovely manager was on point, and handled it every well, she was very apologetic and sincere. overrall, this was a painless experience minus the buffalo chips.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chantilly?start=40,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.544,3.0000000000000004
47,Warren M.,"Arlington, VA",0,2,,1.0,2014-06-11,"Terrible Service can ruin everything! Let me follow be saying; I am a fan of Red Robin.  I love their food, the feel of their establishments and the overall experience of going.  I've been to several RRs in my area and never had a complaint that warranted a negative review or a complaint period.  Until I visited this particular location. I was headed to Chantilly with my mother to visit a friend and remembered passing by this location several times in the past.  So last night was the perfect time to grab a bite to eat.  The parking area is fairly small for the number of guests it can seat inside. But nothing to lose my head over.  When we entered, it didn't appear to be as busy as the parking lot suggested, we were greeted immediately by a very courteous host and seated by the bar.   Red flag one:  We were seated at a four person table; when we clearly saw two-seaters available.  But again, I just assumed that no servers were working that section; so I let it go. Red Flag two: Our waitress, who finally arrived 10 minutes later was also the bartender.  Which means she was filling orders for the bar, making the drinks and taking orders from the bar as well as the main dining area and the outside patio adjacent to the bar. Meanwhile there were other servers in that area, that could have been more attentive. We ordered our drinks (Freckled Lemonade and a Milk Shake).  Red Flag three:  The lemonade is $3.99 w/ free refills. Not once throughout the evening did the waitress ask if a refill was needed and the Shake was 3/4 filled with the rest of the glass filled with whipped cream.  (On an unsanitary note: One guy working the bar; probably a manager of some type by what he was wearing; after filling a drink order used his fingers to clean the inside of a glass that he just filled with beer). Once we finally got our orders in, it was the kitchen's turn. Red flag four: After more than 20 minutes of waiting for two burgers; one of which that was cooked medium, the food finally arrived.  However, this was still after two other tables (table of 2 and 3); that were sat and ordered after us; received their food.  I guess the wait staff was also responsible for bringing out the food for the tables they were helping; which is unorthodox considering all that she was doing and the other staff there.    The food thankfully was cooked wonderfully.  The only small issue was one of the burgers was missing bacon, but that was quickly corrected.  The main reason to go to RR did not disappoint. Excellent burgers (Guacamole Bacon and Bacon Cheese). Following the meal, the server came and got our plates off the table; which was the fastest thing she did the whole time.  Next came another 20 minute wait for the check in which time our server completely disappeared from sight. We did not see her for the rest of the night. We had to grab another server in order to get the check at which time we asked to speak to a manager.  The waiter tried to smooth things over by removing our drinks, but it was far too late for that. Afterwards we were greeted by a ""Manager in Training"" who took off 50% for the inconvenience. Needless to say this is one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had; which is so hard to say for an establishment that I've never had to complain about until now.  This will not deter my RR visits in the future, only to this particular location and its horrible service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chantilly?start=40,2.92,2.92,2.92,2.148,2.92
90,L. A.,"Falls Church, VA",0,20,,1.0,2014-07-24,"Warning: I'm cranky. The last few times I had been to this location, it hadn't been spectacular, but this time was a nightmare. And I really hate writing bad reviews.  We got there around 8:00. The place was probably less than a quarter full. Our server was reeeeally nice, but  didn't really know the menu.  We ordered the pretzel bites appetizer, which tasted more like salted donuts than pretzels. They were edible, but the beer cheese sauce that came with them tasted like they had mixed some Budweiser with some Velveeta.  As for the entrees...for some reason there was a long delay (20 minutes?)  between when we finished the pretzel bites and when the entrees came out, even though we ordered them at the same time. No big deal. There was a mistake with one of the entrees, and after waiting a while for our server to come back, I finally had to get up and find her to ask her to fix it. The cole slaw that came with the Clucks and Shrimp looked yellow and...goopy.  No one touched it.  The toddler in our party ordered pizza, which came with a little cup of mandarin oranges (with seeds?) on the side. The pizza looked greasy and soggy and sat at an angle in one of those red baskets so that all of the greasy cheese was slumped over to one side. The child took one bite, frowned and declared that it was ""not good"". Then he took a second bite and bit down on something hard. And that was the end of that. His hands went in to his mouth, trying to dig it out, and his face wrinkled up in a half-gag, and for a very tense minute I thought he was going to throw up. Thankfully, he did not. But he also didn't touch that pizza again. (Can't blame him.) My Bleu Ribbon burger was overcooked and was the weirdest combination of flavors I've ever had on a burger. There are few foods I won't eat if you put them in front of me, and I got less than half of it down. If I HAD to say one positive thing about this visit, it would be that the roughly 9 steak fries I was given, were hot, fresh and delicious. No, I didn't order a refill on them. No, the server never did come back after delivering our nasty food to ask how it was. Or why no one was eating.  Yes, after giving up on my burger, I don't know why, but I did ask for a To Go box. Which never came. In hindsight, that's perfectly fine with me.  Since no one really ate much dinner, someone made the questionable decision to order dessert to go, and I headed off to the restroom. I thought the night could not get worse, but I was wrong. I will spare you the details, but let's just say that they were dirty and I overheard some stuff in there that you never want to hear anywhere, let alone in a restaurant.  By the time I got back to the table, I was pretty sure I was done eating for the night.  Unfortunately, it took about 20 minutes for us to get our To Go desserts (they came out one at a time?) and our check came 5 minutes or so after that. We paid, left an 18% tip (not really sure why), and FINALLY we were free. But it wasn't over! When we got home, my party decided we should eat that dessert. (Ugh. Seriously, people?) My appetite was still shot, but in a feeble attempt to be a good sport, I forced down a couple sips of a chocolate milkshake, and a bite each of the red velvet cake and cheesecake. The milkshake was super rich, but tasted pretty good.  The red velvet cake was mushy and warm. (Why?) The cheesecake was inedible - warm and almost soupy. Our car ride was less than 15 minutes, and we had the air conditioner blasting, so I think it arrived at our table that way. It's like it had been sitting out all day.  This was the worst dining out experience I've had in at least 15 years. Or maybe ever. Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chantilly?start=80,2.92,2.92,2.92,2.244,2.92

Endless steak fries are OK but nothing better than you could make at home use Ore-Ida.  Now you got to watch it on the beverages.  Having non alcoholic special lemonades and ice tea, the beverages were over half the total cost of a 40 dollar bill yesterday, 22 dollars in non alcoholic drinks for 3 people and 18 bucks on hamburgers.  I asked for a takeaway cup rather than leave 4 bucks of a drink behind.  So watch it on the beverages, with tip and tax we paid almost 50 bucks for 3 people to eat burgers.

48,Eli L.,"Herndon, VA",401,161,5.0,4.0,2014-10-10,"It may be a bit hard to categorize Red Robin. Is it a ""better burger"" chain like BGR or Five Guys? Or is it best thought of as a casual sit down place like Friday's or Ruby Tuesday? Either way, the chain as a whole and this location in particular are good, generous, and well prepared...service is friendly and competent if not always as speedy as it could be. (I suspect actually, that there's a trade off here, a reasonably low priced menu won't generate many tips unless each server has an above average number of tables.) The tavern burgers, Royal Red Robin Burger, and Milkshakes ar all great. The unlimited refills on many sides (salad, fries etc) are great of you are hungry.

We decided since we were already in the parking lot and would probably never decide to come again that we would give it a shot. Yeaaaaah, definitely a once in a blue moon type deal. We were greeted by a young lady at the host stand that looked like she'd seen better days- I think she was sick, you know that face that you can't hide when you feel so under the weather? Poor girl, I wanted to send her home myself. The atmosphere itself was just odd- it felt kind of sad in there, I'm not sure how else to describe it.  We were seated in the bar area at a high table and told our server would be right over...10 minutes passed and still nothing- we decided to move to the bar. One of my biggest pet peeves is when someone says ""huh?"" when they've misheard you- as an industry worker (as I myself have been) you never say ""huh?"" to your guests (or anyone..grr) so that put me off a little. That being said, our bartender was nice but the bar itself seemed to be lacking some essentials, such as half sized beer naps you get pretty much every other place you go- ours were the long napkins which she folded in half- not a big deal, just seemed odd. We spent a few minutes browsing the menu; sooo many things but nothing that jumped out. We got a half order of the onion rings, they were decent; we were half way through our half order when our food arrived..it wasn't timed right at all. We got the whiskey bbq river burger meduim (it was cooked medium well) and the California chicken club (I was craving quac). Neither were very impressive or too ehh; the burger however would have been much better had it been cooked to the temperature we ordered it. We were also charged extra for a dipping sauce we wanted to try with the onion rings, our bill came out to almost $40, not thrilled. Overall it was one of those experiences you look back on and think, I didn't miss anything by coming and I sure won't miss anything not coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chantilly,2.64,2.64,2.64,2.2800000000000002,2.64

They have a thing with all these sauces you can choose from - not sure I am a real fan of those.  I  stick to what comes on the burger and sometimes we ask for ranch and/or honey mustard for the fries. I am also a fan of the Red Robin seasoning they have on the tables.  Sprinkle some on the fries - yum!  If you really like it - ask to buy some......it's great on steak and burgers at home - chicken too!

The melty cheese really tops off the juicy flame broiled burgers and the burger had a seasoned aoili on it that really brought the burger together.  Overall it was a great experience and the tavern double is an excellent take on the classic american double cheeseburger.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chantilly?start=60,2.8,2.8,2.8,2.576,2.8

We walked in to a bustling atmosphere, and our party of three was seated right away.  Our waitress arrived shortly thereafter and took our drink order, explained the menu and offered suggestions on appetizers (I always like this as they have the inside scoop).   Our first dinner item was the Red's Tavern double burger with a side of fiery ghost pepper sauce and garlic herb fries.  The burger was juicy and had lots of flavor and the ghost pepper sauce was just the right amount of kick.  The garlic fries are addicting-ly yummy and I could have made a meal on that alone.  And, the fries are bottomless! The little one ordered the kids cluck-a-doodles and fries.  She, seemed to enjoy them. I ordered the Avo-Cobb-O, and Oh was it good!  The mixed greens were fresh and very crisp, hard-boiled eggs, bacon, bleu cheese, avocado and grilled chicken was delicious.  I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner selection.

My daughter's meal came out incorrectly but the server quickly fixed it.  She ate her entire bowl of mac & cheese.  My son inhaled his meatballs and apple slices. My burger came out and it was perfect.  I used my app to count my calories and was able to eat half of my burger and 7 french fries and I had a meal for the next day's lunch (minus the fries because they are gross when reheated).

7,Keegan Z.,"Richmond, VA",88,225,672.0,3.0,2016-07-31,"While much of what I wrote before still stands, there has been a significant turnover in both serving staff and management. This is common in chain restaurants, though usually good hiring procedure results in a pretty standard quality of service. This has not been the case here, with service times increasing greatly and managers being more about explaining why things are going wrong rather than by finding solutions for those issues.  As a final thought, I would err on the side of clarifying your coupons before using them here. I was given a hard time about the last one I tried to use, despite it being seemingly eligible for the purchase I was making. Go figure.

14,Matthew S.,"Washington D.C., DC",15,177,49.0,4.0,2016-08-01,Red Robin is slowly upping their game - they are expanding their menu with more unique burger/smokehouse/brewpub options and have a greater craft beer selection to entice the patrons. Luckily they still have the unlimited fry refills and bottomless beverages. I'm a fan of the five alarm burger with jalapeno coins and chipotle aioli.
