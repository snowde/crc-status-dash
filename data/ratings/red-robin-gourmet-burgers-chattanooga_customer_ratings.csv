49,Kylix T.,"Chattanooga, TN",0,5,1.0,3.0,2012-12-15,"Service was more interested in their fellow coworkers than us. They were also more attentive to their closing duties than to our needs. (We arrived about an hour before they close.) Very slow refills, no napkins, we even received our appetizer AFTER our main course (which the waiter thought was funny) and everything was luke warm to boot. Not hot. It was obviously made and then left to get cold instead of being delivered to our table. I like Red Robin when the food is prepared correctly, but this is the typical type of service you receive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chattanooga?start=40,2.732,2.732,2.732,2.732,2.7320000000000007
52,Becky S.,"Compton, CA",2,9,1.0,5.0,2013-01-06,"Our first visit to the restaurant was a little disappointing as our waitress was more interested in gossipping and checking her nails. Our drinks were never refilled and our food arrived lukewarm, probably sat in the window. I ordered the chicken chiabatta and it arrived on a rusty skillet. We asked for a manager and described everything to him. He was very nice and apologetic and fixed the problems.  The food was not great but it was still good and we still wanted to pay for it even after his offer to comp everything. He promised it would be better next time we came back and it truly has. We've been back several times since and couldn't be happier with the dependably good service and the food, it turns out, is really good when it's hot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chattanooga?start=40,2.868,2.868,2.868,2.868,2.868

41,Tiffany Y.,"Marietta, GA",213,239,472.0,3.0,2013-08-12,"When I lived in Chattanooga for 2 years, I frequented this Red Robins a lot.  So with a very random trip to Chattanooga the other night, my main goal was to stop by RR and get the only thing I eat there... The Whiskey River BBQ burger with the vegan BOCA patty substitute.... NO MAYO...   Well it was after 10pm and every employee looked like they were ready to go home and were acting like they were ready to go home, but the waitress at the bar managed to take our order while continuing to talk nonstop to her coworkers.   So while my sister and I waited for our food at the bar we didn't say anything, we just wanted to get our food and go... we were tired.  And while waiting at the bar the lights went out in the restaurant, not a power outage, more like someone flipped the switch off...and it was a bit uncomfortable, but the lights were back on soon enough.   We eventually got our food, checked the contents... my sister with her bacon cheese burger, I with my BOCA patty.... the food was correct!!! or so I thought.  So we got in the car and as we drove away, I prepared my empty stomach for a vegetarian delight, but something caught my eye on that burger... something was glowing in the dark.  So I lifted the top bun and behold MAYO... globs of MAYO on my burger, which I specifically asked for NO MAYO.  So with growling noises close to an angry lion, I tell my mother to turn the car around.... we're going back.   I walk back into RR with box in hand, pissed!!!  I went to the bar and told the waitress my burger had not only MAYO on it but extra MAYO.  So as my temper usually gets the better of me, I tell her I don't have time to wait for another burger... I just wanted my money back....  So off she exits to the kitchen and up pops a manager who is nice and apologizes for the mayo on my burger and said because it was a BOCA patty it wouldnt take long to remake... But he wanted to give me fresh fries... so I text my sis in the car and she's like they'll wait.  So the manager surprisingly gives me a gift card for the mistake and again apologizes.  By then my anger had passed and when he handed me my food, I ran like a mad person out the door to the car.   The order was right this go round... no glowing MAYO...  The only thing saving from giving them 2 stars was that it's a good veggie burger substitute (firm texture and a grilled-like taste) and the manager was nice and that I've had a similar experience at this location before (I received meat instead of veggie patty) but management was helpful then.  Other than that it's usually an okay place to eat at but like all restaurants they have their off moments.  Would I go back if I was in the Chattanooga area...sure.  Will I check my food even closer next time...you betcha!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chattanooga?start=40,2.444,2.444,2.444,2.444,2.444

44,Stacy B.,"Clermont, FL",20,42,9.0,2.0,2014-05-03,"Despite coming in at 2:30 pm on a random Wednesday afternoon (4-30-14) to a virtually empty restaurant, the service was dismal. We approach the podium, the young man asked how many in our party, (2) then said ""hold on a minute"", then disappeared for about 5 min. Really? You don't anticipate customers and have a basic knowledge at any time of available tables?  We were finally seated at a booth and were at least acknowledged within a few minutes. Ordering was slow, but waiting for the food to arrive was seriously bad. I actually stood up to look for the waitress after awhile, because really, how long does a burger and fries take?! I noticed a lonely order was sitting back at the ledge at the kitchen, and since we were virtually alone in the restaurant, I knew it was ours just sitting there getting cold. And it was. No apologies for the long wait, no refills on our drinks, no clearing of the salad plates. The food was cold; so I immediately ordered a basket of unlimited fries and they came out hot and fresh. I would've asked for a new hot burger, but it was now 3:15 pm and I was very hungry by this point.  I gave this two stars because the food was good; they really have awesome burgers and fries, but for $10-$15 plus tip meal at a burger joint, you expect better service, especially at an off time.  I will definitely try coming back again due to the quality of the food, but with good management and service, they could be so much better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chattanooga?start=40,2.056,2.056,2.056,2.056,2.056
32,Janet M.,"New York, NY",0,23,,3.0,2014-09-06,"I think that if Red Robin had to rely on everything BUT their superlative burgers, they would cease to be. Fortunately for them, they've perfected the burger making process, so on a recent visit, we were unsurprisingly pleased with our meals.  However, we were also unsurprisingly underwhelmed with everything else.   My ""alcoholic"" beverage, for example, barely made a dent in my liver.  For $7, I expect more than a cup of ice and some pina colada mix, but that's what I got.  Tips from my bar tab can pay for a semester of college, so if your bar tending skills are on point, I will be your BFF. Unfortunately for this outpost, I didn't even want to try another cocktail had I been asked. Which I was not. What really lets down Red Robin seemingly at every location is service issues.  Servers seem trained either poorly or not at all.  Our waitress was very pleasant, but didn't ask if we wanted another round of drinks or any dessert, which was odd since we mentioned it was my birthday. The runner that dropped off our meals literally dropped off our meals and ran without giving us cutlery or napkins. We spent nearly 5 minutes trying to flag down any server for cutlery and eventually another waitress assisted us, but it's aggravating to watch your meal getting cold because you can't find one server in a place this size to help you out. This brings me to my biggest issue with every Red Robin I've been to: servers disappearing for long periods of time. Where do they go?  Is the kitchen half a mile away? Service is always so slow that I fully expect to be watching Cosmos and see Neil Degrasse Tyson explain the black hole that seems to swallow up Red Robin waitstaff. I love a good burger, but if I have to bring a book and a flask to get through a meal here, I might as well stay home and be aggravated for free.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chattanooga?start=20,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997

25,Janet L.,"Decatur, GA",28,28,37.0,4.0,2015-10-12,"For the longest time, I had been wanting to come to Red Robin-- maybe because I had that signature ""Red Robin, yuuum!"" tune stuck in my head (Pretty good marketing there haha) but also I was intrigued by the Blue Moon shake I'd heard about.  This location is attached to Hamilton Place Mall. We came for a late lunch and had a pretty nice time. There was confusion with change of shift and seating so it took a second longer than normal to be seated.  So vegetarians beware... This is clearly not the place for you. Burgers, burgers, burgers... Dominate the menu. When you're a chain restaurant though, it's probably best to specialize hardcore on something. Red Robin does that well. I'm not typically a beef eater, but I loved that Whiskey BBQ burger with the endless sweet potato fries. It wasn't the best burger I've ever had, but for a chain, it was rockin.  As for drinks... Man, I love Blue Moon, and I love shakes... So when you put it together, that Blue Moon shake was an excellent complement to my meal. My boyfriend (also DD for the day) had the nonalcoholic orange cream soda or something to that tune. He said it was pretty good. As far as service goes, it was good. But they make it easy too because you have this touch screen pad at the table that allows you to call for your server (like the bell button you find at Korean BBQ places). We only had to use the call button once. Our waiter was pretty good.  The environment is fun and casual. There's some tvs around and lots of cool decor. The one thing I'd caution though is that they don't really make it clear that playing games or things on the touch pad adds a $1.99 entertainment fee to your bill. It wasn't a big deal when we found out, but it would have been nice to know beforehand.  Other notes- parking is easy because it's at a mall (though I guess it could get dicey as the prime holiday season shopping gets underway). The place is clean, and the bathrooms aren't gross. So all in all, not a bad place to stop and grab some grub before or after you do some shopping. I'll definitely be back... For the Blue Moon shake if nothing else!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chattanooga?start=20,2.032,2.032,2.032,2.032,2.032

Two staff members alternated, neither seemed particularly interested, disappearing for most of my visit. When I asked to settle up, the lady apologized for the poor service and made some excuses about being short staffed. Sounds like a management issue. I got the vegan burger. For some reason,  a few places seem to believe that because a meatless sandwich won't make you sick if it's not heated, there's no need to worry about it. Well, it may not make you sick, but it's still unpalatable when cold. The ""bottomless"" fries were cold and stale, so I didn't test the bottom.

39,Brandon H.,"Atlanta, GA",3,29,,4.0,2016-04-08,"I was contacted this week by Red Robin employees and was given a 20.00 gift card along with an apology. I appreciate them reaching out and that is very good customer service. Their attempt to make up for the poor evening was acceptable and made all the difference in my returning to try them again. Reaching out shows respect for your customers and as a person who eats out a significant amount these days, businesses that show their appreciation for my patronage are placed on my go to list (It doesn't hurt my fiance LOVES RR). Went to RR again to give them another try. Ordered the Blue Ribbon burger and remembered to order it with plenty of pink. Burger came out this time as ordered and the meat was cooked perfectly. That's the good news. Now here's the bad news. The burger was mediocre at best. I've figured out why though. It's the meat. I don't know if they switched vendors, if it's prepared differently or what, but the flavor and quality of the meat simply doesn't seem to be as good as it once was. The burger cooked to medium (which is about as close to medium rare as you're going to get at RR) was still dry and flavorless. It crumbled apart. The toppings of the burger were good (I'm a Bleu Cheese lover). I ordered it with double meat on it this time. My fiance eats her burgers cooked to well, well, well done and she thinks their Guacamole Bacon Burger is heaven on Earth. Both girls enjoyed their meals. My daughter had pizza (which she said was fantastic) My other daughter had meatball bites (she said they were tasty). I'm becoming picky in my old age I suppose. Red Robin did make up the previous issue though and they demonstrated excellent customer service and commitment to excellence. The meat issue is likely something that won't be fixed anytime soon. On that note, next time I go, I'm going to try the new premium burgers which I believe have a higher quality meat. I'll update my review on those. Also, they do make tasty chicken sandwiches especially the California one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chattanooga?start=20,3.12,3.12,3.12,2.16,3.1200000000000006

37,Haley J.,"Chattanooga, TN",0,6,,1.0,2016-10-10,"My husband and I typically love Red Robin. We have been to many other locations, and they have always been great. This was a very different experience. The host sat us at a table in the back, and after about 15 minutes of no one stopping by our table, my husband told the host. After he told the host, it still took about 10 minutes for a waitress to stop by. Once we had a waitress stop by, she told us that we were sitting in a section that was closed (although how was this my fault...that is where the host sat us). Once we ordered, it took at least 20 minutes to get our food, and we had very simple orders. Once we finished eating, it took at least 10 minutes to get our check (we were just sitting there with empty plates), and once she brought the check, it took another 10 minutes for her to pick it back up with the card. I noticed a lot of the other customers had empty drinks or empty plates. There were a lot of tables that needed to be cleaned. However, it wasn't busy at all. There were employees just standing around in a circle talking to each other the entire time we were there. One other annoying thing was that we were sitting right by the kitchen, and we could hear very loud techno type music coming from the kitchen in addition to the music playing in the rest of the restaurant. We will definitely not be eating here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chattanooga?start=20,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
10,Bill P.,"Chattanooga, TN",118,178,2069.0,1.0,2016-12-15,"We knew we shouldn't do it, but after some shopping at the mall last night, we said what the heck, let's go to Red Robin.   I told our server that we hadn't been there since 2007, when we had another bad experience.  Peyton was our server.  Great server but he didn't have much to work with.   Now let's say you're going to start a place known for hamburgers.  What is going to be your point of emphasis?  Alcoholic beverages?  Milkshakes?  Fries?  The bun and condiments?  No, the main thing is going to be the actual friggin burger itself.  When you serve a burger that is not perfectly round and is irregularly shaped, that is a good thing and says you hand pattied it there right before you cooked it or shortly before.  Unfortunately, the burger patties here ARE perfectly round, like they were stamped out of a machine.  And they taste like it.  And it is a very fine grind -- too fine.   We got the chili cheese fries as an app and split the gourmet cheeseburger.  Krystal's chili cheese fries are 100 times better than these, which were cold and devoid of flavor.  The burger, which they split for us, along with the steak fries (fries were very good), had a relish on the bottom bun that completely ruined the taste.  Our server warned us about it, but we figured how bad could it be?  It's bad.  But even after scraping that off, it was still a bad burger with little flavor.  I don't know how many better burgers there are in town than this place.  You could start with McDonald's and go from there. I really wonder how this place makes it being so bad.  Me thinks is combination of location, festive decor, booze, and the fact that evolution has caused humans to lose their taste buds.  People eat anything these days.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chattanooga,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32

My server was racist my food was wrong and cold waited like 30 mins before I was seated waited another 30 mins before he took my order. My soda was watered down. After complaining about my food the manager said he was gonna fix it so he brought back the same cold ass burger and cold ass fries. And the same watered down drinks. They only have 1 black in the whole establishment and he is a cook. The staff was AWFUL and not friendly that was my FIRST AND LAST TIME eating at a red robin ever in life.

This location has always bordered on mediocrity, but after today I can say without hesitation that this is the worst Red Robin I've ever experienced. The service here is non-existent, I sat a table for 10 minutes while staff walked back and forth with no one taking a drink order. I watched a table of 4 get seated next to me and they faired no better. Once I was able to order then began the 60+ minute wait for $12.00+ cheeseburger accompanied by cold French fries. The table of 4? They waited an additional 10minutes before their food was served. All over the restaurant people were walking out without eating because no one was being served. There were no apologies, no managerial visits and no class at this place. This place is a dump and if I try to come here again please slap me into next week!!!

We never even got our food, we left after 30 minutes after placing our order and never being visited again.

Of course the environment is amazing and such a neat area.  I have to really brag that hearing the staff talk and interact with everyone is so different from other restaurants.

There are also tables that have not been cleaned off the whole time I was there (each time).

I got their Burnin` burger that had a lot of jalapenos and even had a grilled one on top. I enjoy it I want if I'm out in that area again wanting a hamburger, I will go to Red Robin.

We have eaten and enjoyed meals at Red Robin's in Durham and Charlottesville -- both very clean, comfy ambiance, nice for a low key dinner while traveling. This location is NOT recommended.  The lighting is awful -- super bright, not relaxing at all.  The Caesar salad is actually just a head of romaine lettuce. Nothing else aside from excessive dressing. Do not order this. Fries were over salted.  Our waiter was polite and sporadically attentive. However, he needed reminders on ordered items and seemed overwhelmed.
