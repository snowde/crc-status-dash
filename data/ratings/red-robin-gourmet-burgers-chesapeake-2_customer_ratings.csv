98,Amanda R.,"Chesapeake, VA",77,22,3.0,2.0,2012-02-21,"I like Red Robin, usually.  It is a great place to take the kids.  It's loud, so it's okay if your baby cries, etc.  My 3 year old loves the chicken on a stick with broccoli.  This visit wasn't as good for me, though.  I had the fried chicken salad, my usual, but it didn't sit well this time.  I was RUNNING for the bathroom when I got home!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chesapeake-2?start=80,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003
70,Lance F.,"Omaha, NE",171,327,214.0,4.0,2012-03-08,"Let me preface this by saying that I really am not a Red Robin fan.  Never have been.  But, on a recent Wednesday evening while out running around, the family and I got a crazy urge to go to Red Robin.  I don't know why.  I wanted a burger and no one else had any opposition, so away we went.   We arrived around 7 pm and were told there would be a 15 minute wait and that was fairly accurate.  Once we were seated, we were promptly greeted by Amanda C., who was attentive and friendly all evening.  We started with an appetizer of cheese sticks and onion rings and both were a big hit.  It was actually a great deal.  For $5.99, we got five cheese sticks and a half dozen or so pretty big onion rings.  All were gone quickly.   For dinner, my wife ordered a petite burger, which is good for her appetite.  The only complaint was that it was really just a kids burger for which they charged us only one dollar less than the regular while the kids meals were several dollars cheaper.  I'll just make her order the kids meal next time!  The kids had a burger and chicken fingers and both were gone in no time.  I had a bacon guacamole burger of some sort and it was quite good.  My wife didn't like the fries much but I did.  I just wish I hadn't stuffed myself on appetizers because I didn't take advantage of the ""bottomless"" option.  I didn't even order another round of fries.  20-year old Lance would be ashamed. After we got home, my oldest son asked when we could go back to Red Robin because in his words, ""everyone seemed to enjoy it"".  And you know what, I have to agree.  Everyone did enjoy it.  And while I am not a truly a 'fan', I would definitely return if the urge hits.  It was a pleasant night out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chesapeake-2?start=60,3.12,3.12,3.12,3.12,3.1200000000000006

101,Erika C.,"El Paso, TX",0,5,,5.0,2012-06-28,"So I'm guessing, more like hoping, that Red Robin opened their eyes. We went back only because my boyfriend wanted a burger so we tried this place AGAIN. We were extremely hesitant but wow have they changed. The burgers actually have more flavor and the fry situation, well let's just say there isn't one anymore. Everyone at the table gets their own portion now and not just a pathetic communal basket with 5 fries in it. My parents came in from where they don't have a Red Robin and they loved it. The onion rings are some of the best that we have had thus far and the BBQ burger........ left me speechless. I don't know what prompted Red Robin to ""change"" but whatever it was, hopefully Yelp, I like it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chesapeake-2?start=100,3.124,3.124,3.124,3.124,3.124

Great fried shrimp and chicken and of course their signature milkshakes. I dare say their milkshakes bring all the boys to the yard! ;)  While my husband was waiting there for me to arrive he accidentally scored a small gash on his ankle from a bolt that sticking out of the ground. He let them know about it inside and the manager comped us with a free appetizer. The pretzel bits were very good with melted cheese for dipping! By the time we left I saw that they had properly secured the bolt in question and even gave my hubby a bandaid.

84,Leland L.,"Oceanside, CA",39,208,87.0,3.0,2013-01-07,"I have been to many Red Robin's all over. The main complaint that I have over and over again is that everything comes out COLD. I want HOT fries, like so hot you have to let them cool.  I do not understand how they can cook food but everything always comes out cold. Maybe it is their system of letting it sit before it is delivered. I do not know.  I normally get a burger or a wrap. My most recent visit, I got a burger. Yet again, burger is Cold. I think it is totally that they take the burger off the grill, let it cool, and then put it on a cold bun. Then let it sit before they serve it. I WANT HOT FOOD.  So as our burgers were being placed in front of us by the food runner, I say to my friend, that the one thing that annoys me is that Red Robin's burgers always come out cold. Every restaurant, every time, they are cold. Without even saying anything to us, the food runner alerts the manager our burgers are cold. So the manager comes out, offers to remake, which I explain will do no good since the replacements will come out cold. I explain that its their delivery system that keeps the food cold.  The manager said our burgers would be free! Nice.  The service was excellent, we never had to ask for refills on drinks, and we were offered fries.  My only complaint is their system. However, they keep the fries warm after they take them out of the fryer does not work, and their waiting to let food cool for delivery is terrible.  The food is good, it is just COLD.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chesapeake-2?start=80,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003

65,Alex H.,"Norfolk, VA",150,174,38.0,2.0,2014-01-22,"This is about the 2nd time in 6 months that I've visited the Greenbrier Red Robin. All of my visits have been average, about a 3 star experience.  The last visit was not that and a combination of things pursued me to give RR-GB a 2 star rating. First, I wonder when did RR-GB become a nightclub.  As we approached the host/hostess podium, we were asked if everyone in our party was over 21.  The explanation only came after I asked, ""Why?"".  Well, apparently, you can only eat in the bar area if you are over 21 years of age.  Does that mean if you say, ""Yes!"", that no one will check your ID? Maybe people of age have been sharing their adult beverages with their underage brethren.  Who knows; it was never fully explained, so we took our place in the dining room. I'm somewhat forgiving if I see the wait person hustling and ours was burning holes in her shoes, it seemed, trying to service her tables.  It was hard, however, to get glasses filled and for her to remember things that we requested for the table.  She touched our table less than most too. All of the food was OK except my Royal Red Robin Burger.  First, I wanted the egg over medium.  Our waitperson said it only comes sunnyside up or over hard.  Why, I wondered?  How much work does it take to flip an egg and pull it before the yolk hardens?  Well, the 'new' manager happen to be cruising by and heard my order; she said, ""Oh, we can do that!""  The wait person started to back peddle, ""Well, she's new and we were told we couldn't do that.""  That was a sign of things to come.  I also asked for the burger to come to the table 'Cantina style' - green chilies and pepper jack cheese. After a longish wait, the burgers arrived.  My burger hit the table last with a sunnyside up egg and American cheese.  I immediately reminded our wait person what my order was; she reacted by reached for the plate and I stopped her.  I didn't want to wait for a re-do, anticipating a long wait, so I took it 'as-is' and asked for the chilies and pepper jack on the side.  After all the discussion about how I wanted my burger, I had to just scratch my head; why can't the kitchen get this right?  I have to assume that our wait person didn't put it in the POS system correctly; wouldn't you? We sat forever, it seemed, as we waiting for takeout containers and the checks. My chilies and pepper jack was added to someone else's check then credited on the same check.  WHAT?  No harm, no foul, I guess...I was ready to get out of RR-GB. Our visit to RR-GB has some major hiccups.  They have been in this location long enough to have these things worked out; I personally expected better. Maybe I should put some space between this and my next visit.  What would you do?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chesapeake-2?start=60,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006

This location isn't very visible from the street but not it's hidden either. I guess for me it just kinda blends, which could've been one of the reasons we hadn't come by sooner. When we walked inside it was nearly a full house so we had to wait a bit in the front seating area. It was clean and comfortable and it didn't take too long. The staff was extremely friendly from the hostess to the server but we did have a bit of a delay from the time our order went in to the time it arrived.  The burgers are either pick from the menu or build your own and since we did a combination of building onto what they offered there's not much reason to talk specifics about our burger order...other than to say it was very good but not great.

Table tops and booths are cleaner but service is just not there. The a/c vents blow air to strong and cold to enjoy food before it becomes cold. We ordered the creamy artichoke & spinach dip, the smoke & pepper burger, and the gourmet cheeseburger. The creamy artichoke & spinach dip was too salty, with some soggy tortilla chips, and rotten celery sticks. Sometimes I don't understand how vegetables can be served when they are clear as day bad. The smoke and pepper burger itself was very good. The beef patty has lots of smoke flavor. Very nice! However, the sweet potato fries were soggy and cold, as though our order had been sitting for ten minutes before  arriving at our table.  The gourmet burger. I ordered this because I wanted to try ""the original"". It was unsatisfying for a few reasons: (1) waitress didn't offer the different buns available, (2) it was flavorless, (3) wasn't it supposed to come with tomato? Maybe the cook was sleeping, (4) I think you get the idea. The burger came with bottomless fries but the refill didn't arrive until right before we were ready to leave. Husband's freckled lemonade ran empty three times and it could've been filled at least three more times but our waitress was nowhere to be found.

Our waitress was patient and kind, which is always a plus, but when we arrived to our table there was an abandoned crayon on it, leading me to believe the tables weren't as clean as they could be. I had a raspberry sort of bubbly drink with whipped cream on top that is weirdly not on the online menu-- it was delicious, but no free refills on it. My partner had a ""Poppin' Purple Lemonade"" that was also great and DID have free refills. The glasses were adorable.  Food wasn't anything to rave about. I had a ""Royal Red Robin"" burger, which is the burger with an egg. The egg and bacon were pretty good, everything else was fine; a house salad instead of fries with MORE than enough cucumbers than ANYONE could ever want or need. Partner had hot wings, the third person I was with had a grilled turkey burger which was also okay. Whole ordeal was alright.

We just went today and the host that welcomes you at the door --Sydney, was the rudest, most unprofessional host a restaurant can put in the front to greet. My family and I walked in, she barely even looked at us, grabbed a few menus and started walking to later come back and shout ""I'm right here... come on"" as if we knew we had to follow her. She made no eye or verbal contact except for giving us attitude. She was than asked to bring us kid coloring sheets and never delivered them. Her attitude was again unprofessional in every way.  The food has also gone down hill for me on taste and appearance. The fries had no flavor, and the amount served wasn't a fair amount for the price. The burgers weren't what you expected it to be... They were poorly put together!! The drinks were flat and to get a refill seem like forever.  My family and I won't be going back for a very long time, if not, ever again.

I went there for dinner bc my sister and cousin were craving burgers and fries so I just tagged along. They have renovated stuff within their building, from what i noticed they created a partition wall near the bar and entrance, enclosed rather than open, changed the open table seating area with red tufted leather seats and a red table. As we entered there was a small wait,  and during that wait there was a confrontation between the hostess and another customer. #1 Never yell back at a customer, be professional even though they are wrong (#keepcalm)it's  bad for business. My entire impression: Had second thoughts about eating here and is that how am I gonna get treated here. As we sat down, we waited for our waitress for a long time maybe about 15-20 min. She finally got to us and took our orders. Another waitor or manager (couldn't tell)had brought us our food. My sister and I had ordered the Royal Burger, which is consisted of a meat patty cooked to your liking I got it cooked medium (little pink), cheese, lettuce and tomato (I got that on the side rather in the burger), and topped with a sunny-side-up egg (cooked on your preference,  I wanted over-easy), gave me the wrong cooked egg and had gotten an over-hard egg, which is basically a Sunny-side-up egg cooked all the way no runny yolk.  It also comes with bottomless fries, or you can choose another bottomless side, cost extra if its a premium side like sweet potato fries. The burger and fries were really good and it hit the spot.  Our waitress,  only took our orders, and checked on us 2x effortless. We would have to use the ""call the server"" button to get her. Bc she is no where to be seen. I felt the other waitor who delivered or food, helped us more than she did. He made sure I had gotten the egg correctly cooked.

So since Red Robin is pretty close to home, I came here with my sister and cousin for dinner. As we walked in, you get greeted by their hostess which was nice. But there was a customer that wasn't too happy so she started a confrontation with the hostess, the hostess tried to ignore her but the customer kept insisting to speak to a manager. Then that's when we saw the ugliness from the hostess, she started raising her voice as well. (I would have just went in the back and just grabbed the manager to deal with the customer instead of yelling back, especially in front of other customers that were waiting to be seated.) Anyways, let's talk about the burger. I love burgers with fried egg in it so I had to try there Royal Red Robin Burger. This burger was on point, since they top it with a fresh fried egg and applewood smoked bacon, gahhhh it's like breakfast in a burger. Delicious!!! I've also tried there Banzai Burger which is a teriyaki marinated patty topped with grilled pineapple. OH Em Gee, it's like being in the tropics having that pineapple on top of that sweet teriyaki burger!! Another must try Burger!! Oh I forgot to say, I use to work here so many years ago. I actually was one of the few that opened this store up. And man oh man, they have definitely changed and renovated the place. Looks so much better, but gotta say even if you make the place look better, they still have to have workers with better working attitudes. Had a waitress, that took our order and barely checked up on us. Let's just say, the food runner was a better waiter than the waitress we had. He made sure everything we had was the way we wanted it. I actually tipped him too! PRO: Burgers were deliciously made, just the way I like it. The renovation they did is really nice!

I just so happened to have a free birthday burger so I thought this would be a great opportunity to use it! Was greeted by the host with a smile and who was happy to seat me in the bar.  My Server was super sweet about my birthday burger. Usually servers get upset about the whole free thing but my girl stayed sweet the whole time. I ordered one I had never tried before. The Ghost Pepper burger. They have two sizes for their Tavern selection burgers. Each of these come with two patties. So you can get a small one which is the same size patty of their regular burger or a large one which is two of their regular sized patties. I wasn't starved so I stuck with the small The burger itself had a little tiny kick to it. But as someone who loves spicy food, it wasn't spicy at all. It was good though! I had also substituted out sweet potato fries for regular fries and I couldn't stop eating them. Haha they were great! I was happy to find out they were bottomless too!  I've been to Red Robin before, just never had the chance to do a Yelp review on them. I've never had a bad burger from here. So I think they really appeal to the masses. They cater from the very picky to ultra fancy burger eaters and then everything in between with salads and normal entrees.  Bathrooms were really destroyed. The first stall I went into didn't have a hook for my purse. So I had to go into the one next to it. When I went to wash my hands the soap dispensers were off of the mirror and on the counter. Then the paper towels didn't work. I think they need matinee to come out really bad to fix a ton of things in there. It gives the restaurant this ""trashy/we don't care"" vibe. So while it wasn't the BEST burger I've ever had, it's definitely somewhere i'd take someone if they had never been before.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chesapeake-2,2.96,2.96,2.96,2.54,2.96

Yes, it's a chain, and they always offer all these new burgers that I always try and I'm semi-disappointed because the original gourmet burgers are always better, but it is just a good place to eat. One word: ONION RINGS. They are worth it. My favorite burger is the BANZAI BURGER. It has some teriyaki sauce and pineapple, basically a tropical burger. They also have a chicken version, if you're not a burger person. The FRECKLED LEMONADE is great, but it's gotten expensive.

A very nice man I later learned was the manager told us that he was sorry it was taking so long and that he was short today and was helping our server out. Dave our server came over again and apologized for taking so long. After we got our food I was disappointed that when you add jalapeños on the sandwich and on the side that you are charged twice for them.

Our servers name was ""Jess""and as she started off in a pleasant way it certainly didn't last long. She took our drink orders and I asked for a water with lemon and everyone else had strawberry lemonade.  She left and came back to the table to bring the drinks and I reminded her that I would like a lemon for my water.  She said OK I will go and get it for you meanwhile we placed an order for appetizers.  While waiting for the appetizers and lemon she was at other tables (rightfully so) but I was hoping that she would bring the lemon because I don't drink water without lemon as it makes me feel queasy by itself. I also asked if we could have a basket of fries while we wait and she then stated ""no you will get it when your meal arrives (in a nasty tone).  The appetizers arrived a little while later and of course I never got the lemon and at that point I just gave up and was about to place an order for a sweet tea (definitely wouldn't say with lemon). She came to the table to take our main orders and after placing our order I asked if I could switch my drink and just order a sweet tea instead and I mentioned because I never got my lemon. She then took her hand and banged it on the table very hard and said ""I WILL GO AND GET YOUR LEMON NOW"" in a very angry and sarcastic tone. My guests and I was COMPLETELY taken aback. There was a couple with children sitting across from us that turned to look at our table when they heard the bang on the table top. She proceeded to walk away and within minutes someone else came back a few minutes later with my lemon needless to say, I let the young lady know and had her pass it along to management.  Jess does.

We are frequent dinners at this location and have never in countered such bad food and so so service as this.  Both bartenders were somewhat busy so the fact that they charged us for a $5.39 Belgium beer we never had.........    we happened to walk in with a complete stranger; however, even though we said we're NOT with him she (the bartender) thought we were. Not completely her fault because the guy was a little bit of a jerk and kidding around with her. My husband is the sweetest man put on earth, he volunteered to just pay for the guys beer, so we did, no big deal..... Then there was the food. The food was some of the worst we've ever had here. We had a plain burger with lettuce, tomato, onion and pickles and a teriyaki chicken sandwich hold everything, but the teriyaki sauce, fries with both.  When we got home, which only took about 10 minutes we discovered that we had a plain burger burnt black with absolutely nothing on it. This burger was so burnt it was uneatable.  In the box with the burger was a random piece of bacon and a piece of plastic, sort of melted to a fry.  By-the-way the fries were cold, lol.  The teriyaki chicken wasn't too bad, but in that box was a random piece of onion and macerated piece of lettuce. The fries were just awful; cold hard flavorless.  All-in-all this was just completely poor quality control.  To keep food hot, line the bottom of the box with the foil burger paper. Here's another freebie, put a paper napkin in the box sandwiched between the foil and fries. This will absorb the steam moisture and keep the fries from getting mushy, cold and hard.

The thing that saved it was that it wasn't dry, stick in your throat.  I'm guessing they removed it from the flattop when it had just turned medium well and so it didn't dry out as it continued to cook off the heat.  I guess I'm saying it wasn't  perfect but it was still tasty and certainly not a burger I would send back to the kitchen.

He took like 10 minutes getting my daughter her chocolate milk, forgot my husbands coffee twice, spent about 10 minutes getting my husband his side of honey mustard, we had barely a handful of fries each and when I asked for a refill he literally NEVER brought one, and we ordered milkshakes and they were in tiny kids drink cups that (including whipped cream) were barely halfway full. Literally the entire shake was about 5 sips. We were furious, what a rip off. I don't know if we'll ever come back to be honest and it's a shame",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chesapeake-2?start=20,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005
39,Adam R.,"Burlington, WA",0,2,,2.0,2017-10-24,"Gourmet Burgers is a stretch....Giving 2 stars because they didnt charge for trying to get it correct twice. A place that basically only sells ""gourmet"" burgers should be able to not turn it into a hockey puck.

25,María J.,"Northwest, Virginia Beach, VA",30,1,,2.0,2018-01-03,"I just went last night to this location... quickly sent to be seated and drinks were ordered...  appetizer was super delayed IMAGINE the order! It took more then 30 minutes to get our order... I ordered The Southern Charm: they forgot the onions, the bacon was regular bacon. It's supposed to be caramelized onions and bacon, nope, didn't happened. The freckle lemonade was served with more ice then the drink, every time my daughter or I did tried to drink from our glass either a strawberry or the ice was in the straw...  I couldn't finish the burger, I ordered medium and it came back burnt.  I told the waitress to tell the manager, the manager NEVER came to our table, on our way out, I asked the waitress if she told the manager, she said ""yes, but we are short of managers tonight, sorry""  WOW!!! Money waisted last night.   I'm sure NOT coming back to that location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chesapeake-2,2.8,2.98,2.98,,2.908
21,Steffie A.,"Chesapeake, VA",146,115,259.0,2.0,2018-01-05,"I feel that red Robin has really gone down hill.  I went here on New Year's Eve. I feel like it's a great place to bring a toddler or a kid...because it is usually loud and no one will notice your toddler being a little crazy. Our wait to be seated didn't take long. While we were waiting I took my son to change his diaper and wash his hands. As I was walking towards the bathroom there were chairs in the way of the door. I was carrying my baby and a diaper bag and a purse. I had to use my feet to shove them aside...then I went into the bathroom and sat my son onto the changing table...has this that ever been clean! It was filthy and disgusting and same with the rest of the bathroom. It's just gross! If the bathroom is dirty imagine what the kitchen looks like!  Once we got seated. Our waiter seemed really friendly. We ordered and got our food not too long after. I was very disappointed. The was not hot. The fries were hard...my son's pizza was burnt..also our waiter was terrible at picking up plates that we were done with and refilling drinks. He even said and I quote ""I'm so terrible at busing up my tables...like all my tables are messy""...after seeing how unclean this place can be. I don't think I'll be coming here anymore, and stick with going to the Newport News one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chesapeake-2,2.8,2.98,2.98,,2.908
22,Stephanie H.,"Suffolk, VA",67,209,23.0,4.0,2018-01-10,"I had SUCH a great, easy experience today. I placed my order online in the car to go and I went inside and sat at the bar area and had a drink while I waited for it. Service was great. My burger was ready in about TEN MINUTES! So, not a bad wait at all and it was right around the lunch rush. I forgot the name of the burger, but it was the one that comes with American cheese, bacon and a fried egg. I added avocado and got it on a lettuce wrap (trying to watch my figure ;)) and it was awesome. They even give you the option to get EXTRA fries, since you get bottomless fries when you dine in. Everything was hot, minus the lettuce and it was FRESH. I didn't have to wonder if I was eating something that was left over from the night before like at a popular wing establishment that I visited last week. Mattie was the one who brought out my food and they even give you MORE fries to eat in the car in a cute little cup! Excellent job Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chesapeake-2,2.92,2.98,2.98,,2.956
