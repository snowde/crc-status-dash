51,Emily W.,"Florissant, MO",25,9,22.0,1.0,2012-10-07,"Our experience started off on the right track, but we ended up getting derailed. Everything was business as usual at first.  My husband and I ordered waters and decided on the new pretzel bites as an appetizer (which were really good, actually). The derailment happened after taking a few big gulps of our waters. We realized our glasses had foreign ""floaties"" that weren't caused by us (the insides of the glasses had obvious additions that weren't the requested h2o).  I tried to get the attention of our waitress, but she seemed held captive at another table taking an order (for quite an extended period of time. Not sure if she knew them or they just had a lot of questions about the menu).  So, we received our food from a server and I told him about the waters. He took them and brought us out some new ones. Ok, fine.  While eating our meals my husband receives another water refill from our waitress.  In a new - dirty - glass. Gross. I got her attention and tell her about this current glass and the others. She apologizes sincerely and brings back a new one.  After this, we decide to just get the check and leave, but we forgot we ordered another round of fries for my husband (unlimited steak fries are a good draw-in for potato lovers).  A few minutes after we got them our waitress brings around a basket of sweet potato fries, on the house. Personally, I'm not a huge fan of sweet potato fries, so, it's not quite redeeming to me of the water situation. I'm talking about a total of four dirty glasses. I just felt like if you were going to offer something ""on the house"" could we have an option?  We ate, like, four of them. Anyway, we're going to skip this chain when contemplating options in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chesterfield?start=40,2.212,2.212,2.212,2.212,2.212

Last year as we were contemplating a move to STL we decided to bring the kids to town to play in the city.  One of them was familiar with a trampoline place so we went there.  After working up a powerful appetite we decided to go to Red Robin because our previous locale didn't have one of their restaurants.  Loved everything!  After dinner we needed to fill the tank but I was incensed by the price of gas at the first station where we stopped so I kept driving.  There was a gas station just up the road but I couldn't get to it because of construction so I kept going.  It seemed like I was driving into the middle of nowhere but spotted another station and reluctantly paid a penny per gallon more at this second station. Why is this funny?  Mainly because a couple of weeks after moving into our new house it all clicked...we moved into the area of town where all of this transpired.

I came to this location with my room-mate after he was done with his shift. We decided on Red Robin. Bad move and the reason being was due to the fact that we had a very lousy server. I understand that this place was busy, but the wait and the fact that she gave us really impersonable and grouchy service was inexusable. Secondly, I didn't like her responses at all.  I ordered a BBQ burger with the fruit salad as a side. I normally like to order my sandwiches as a boca version and every server didn't have an issue, but this lady somehow took offense.  ""Are you a vegetarian?"" the lady asks with a grouchy look.  ""Umm, no"" was my response. I acutally shouldn't have come out with a response at all because that wasn't her business. However, I tend to try to act like a mild manner Clark Kent, so I brushed it aside.  We received our food, but I was never presented with untensils. I looked around for my waitress and she was not to be found.  She came back asking what was wrong and I said that I was missing my utensils. Again, came the grouchy look and I was then presented with a knife and fork. I tried to remediate the situation by saying, ""I appreciate your help."" She then gave me a scrunched up look and then said, ""you're wierd."" Like that. I almost fell out of my chair in exasperation. My food was decent, but my room-mate and I agree that we will not be back at this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chesterfield?start=20,2.252,2.252,2.252,2.252,2.252

30,Mark E.,"Chesterfield, MO",193,34,6.0,2.0,2014-01-14,"I love Red Robin and their burgers. I also love their steak fries, or at least I used to. In the past, the fries were on the side of the plate the burger was served on. On my last visit there the fries were neatly arranged standing straight up in a metal cup. It certainly looked pretty and changed the plating quite a bit. But there was a problem. It would seem that in order to you get those fries to stand up so pretty in the metal cops that somebody had to load the metal cups in advance. Then the cups must have been put under heat lamps.  so when it was time to eat the fries, instead of the crisp on the outside and gooey on the inside steak fries that I'm used to, I got dried out, sometimes withered, hunks of potato.  I still love Red Robin, I think their idea of presenting the fries differently is a good one, but it definitely makes them taste much worse then they used to.

I didn't get more than one bite of my burger because there wasn't even enough of the ranch to douse over it to hide the taste... my husband was able to eat the mac n cheese burger because spicy things have zero effect on him... my brother in law had a fraction of his burger because of the burnt-ness too... here's to a $50 meal (just my portion of the bill btw! Not including everyone's in that total!) that consisted of 2 French fries and an iced tea... Oh yah- the ""manager"" that was here today was very apathetic when he visited our table... didn't really care if we were satisfied or not... not sure if I'll be back to this location or not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chesterfield?start=20,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
9,Cyndi S.,"Chesterfield, Saint Louis, MO",103,28,83.0,4.0,2017-01-08,Red Robin is one of my favorite chain restaurants. You can always find good burgers and bottomless fries. Today we went as a family and my husband and I tried Different burgers than we usually get. I tried the black pepper burger with bacon on ciabatta bread and he tried his sweet Carolina as a wedgie burger (wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun). My daughter ordered her favorite simple Veggie burger with bottomless fries and ghost pepper sauce. We all loved what we ate. We loved the fact that we could order anything the way we want it. Our Server was great too. We enjoyed the enhanced menu and enjoyed our overall experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chesterfield,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
5,Caprice F.,"Saint Louis, MO",115,426,1314.0,4.0,2017-03-28,"I sat at the bar for an early dinner last week. The food here is standard as at every location. I had the Smokey Jack Tavern Burger with a freckled lemonade, which were both good. And of course, the bottomless fries with campfire sauce! You can't go wrong with that sauce.

10,Scott C.,"Chesterfield, MO",0,82,,5.0,2017-06-02,"Had to order takeout since George and Fran wanted some ""alone time"".   I got the wings and they were great.  Since I ordered them extra crispy I had to wait about 15 min.  I played the crane game and almost got the big dice.   With George's birthday coming up it would have made the perfect gift.    He says his el Camino could use a little sprucing up.  The all you can eat fries are a problem.   On round six the waitress seemed to lose interest in refilling my plate.   Very disappointing.  Since my sister has a lifetime ban in any franchise store I was solo.  Living the dream guys!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chesterfield,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72

3,Erica R.,"Creve Coeur, Saint Louis, MO",50,72,31.0,3.0,2017-07-08,"Great food. Burgers in the $10 range. More importantly, they covered ALL the bases: two kinds of veggie patty for the vegan teen; a customizable concoction for the teen who'll eat anything; 20 weird options for the ""who knows what she'll do next"" rebel. A classic for their mom, and fish for me. The garlic herb fries are worth the upgrade, no doubt. And for our birthday boy, the LOUDEST birthday song ever, with a sundae! My only disappointment was that I was apparently invisible to our server. I got refills on request, but only by request-- everyone else couldn't finish fries or drinks without them magically reappearing. They couldn't have born more attentive behavior. But I was politely ignored and I never figured out why.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chesterfield,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84
0,Michelle L.,"Saint Louis, MO",68,1007,1635.0,4.0,2017-09-02,"I actually really like Red Robin despite the facts that is it 1. a chain restaurant and 2. geared towards kids and families. Newsflash, the bar is always 21+ at a Red Robin. I was out and about on a busy Saturday and craving a burger. I ordered the Red's Tavern Double® Burger (Two classic-sized patties of fire-grilled goodness with Red's Secret Tavern Sauce™, American cheese, tomato and lettuce.) I asked for the french fries to be extra crispy because I hate limp and soggy fries. When my burger came out the french fries were crispy and perfect! The burger was good too.

1,O W.,"Saint Louis, MO",54,214,118.0,2.0,2017-10-01,The food is generally decent and I love the unlimited fries. But this place seems to have terrible service. They don't listen to what the server orders. They run out of things. And then the manager never comes over and say they're sorry    Then the waitress tells us that she took the bad food off for bill and when I hit the little device it's still on there. Get rid of the stupid TV on the table and take care of your customers,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chesterfield,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004

It's surprisingly good food for a chain. I ordered the Red Robin Gourmet Burger. It was tasty and had everything you'd expect on a burger (pickles, onions, tomatoes, lettuce, etc).
