Now I understand mistakes happen, something about dropping one on the floor, but when reaching almost 2 hours we started to get up and flagged the waitress to get the check. She brought out the food like we were just supposed to still sit there and eat. We asked for it to go. The manager came by, didnt say sorry. They gave us a discount....$4. Took my burger back to my desk. It was greasy, cold, and nasty. After 3 bites I gave up on the thought of eating lunch.

27,Jeremiah F.,"Aurora, IL",43,138,86.0,4.0,2013-09-26,"I've been here several times with family and friends. I'm even a member of their Red Robin Club, whatever it's called. The deals I get through the club are fairly decent so when we're looking to save a little money and have a good burger we head out this way with a coupon or two. Red Robin has a family-friendly atmosphere and as with all chains you know exactly what to expect when you eat there. The service is friendly and the food is always tasty. Having recently changed my eating habits I'm a little sad there's not a bottomless option of something else for me that's not potatoes but that's all on me, not on them.  (EDIT: A member of the Red Robin team has informed me that they DO have other bottomless things that fit into my new way of eating perfectly! I'm looking forward to going again and enjoying one of the options that she lists below in her response!) They're usually happy to substitute a salad for the fries, for which I'm grateful. One of their best deals is the bottomless root beer float. If you like a good root beer float, this one never ends! This is one of the few chain restaurants of which I'm a fan. I'll definitely be returning soon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-christiansburg?start=20,2.9280000000000004,2.9280000000000004,2.9280000000000004,2.9280000000000004,2.928000000000001

34,Dakota M.,"Woodlawn, VA",0,6,,5.0,2015-02-14,"Red Robin, in my opinion, makes the best burger in the United States. I've ate at hundreds of burger joints but none compare to the gourmet burgers that this restaurant has. I've ate at the Red Robin in Christiansburg, Virginia, many times. The food is always cooked to perfection and seasoned well. The service is usually quick, even on crowded nights. If you plan to eat there I would recommend the whisky river barbecue burger. It has breaded onions that offer a perfect crunch. The patty is extremely juicy and the barbecue sauce offers a perfect tangyness. To sum it up. I LOVE RED ROBIN!

We sat and waited for 40 minutes before a manager came. 20 minutes later our food came and it was not only cold but the cheese was congealed. Gross! But after waiting an hour with two kids we had to eat something. The waiter and manager tried but at some point failed and don't even get me started on the unkept bathrooms. Gross!

However, the Blue Moon Can Crafted Cocktail was delicious.  The place was kind of dead on Father's day (possibly because the students were still out of town) but our service was still less than what I'd call quick.  The Tavern burger tasted fine but the patties had an unusually soft texture similar to cheap patties augmented with soybean.  Overall the experience was less than impressive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-christiansburg,2.8920000000000003,2.8920000000000003,2.8920000000000003,2.8920000000000003,2.892000000000001

24,Josh C.,"Charleston, WV",0,1,,2.0,2015-11-02,"Went here two nights in a row because it was close by and I like a good burger. The first evening everything was ok. I ordered a med-rare burger and they got it pretty close which was good for me, and ordered some to-go items to munch on later. The burger did take much longer than I thought it would, and I had no idea that the salad I had substituted for my fries would be served as a literal side to my burger. Being a restaurant manager myself I can say that was a failing effort on the kitchen's speed and the bartender's communication with their guest. All that said, the burger was freshly cooked and pretty damn good.  On to the next day; I had just got off of my 10 hr shift and hadn't had a proper meal all day so I figured I'd order a burger and wings to-go. The phone rang 10-15 times before I had gotten an answer. Told the gentleman on the phone I wanted my burger as rare as you'll cook it, to which he replied, ""medium?"" Either he was uninformed or the bartender the previous shift didn't tell me that med-rare was not an option. He told me 15-20 min and didn't not give me a total for the bill. I arrived 20 min later and had to wait about 5 min for the food. Needless to say it was dead that night and the night prior. Once I got back with the food I looked at the ticket on the bag and the burger said ""no pink."" Of course it was well-done and I'll was quite pissed that I paid $15 for a well burger. Also did not receive the cole slaw even though it said it on the ticket. Moral of the story is that the food, after a long wait for it is not bad, but the overall pace and service are almost unbearably bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-christiansburg?start=20,,,,,

The noodles were actually white and plain. The service was not great. My boyfriend went about 15 minutes without a refill. If it's cold out, don't sit next to a window because the draft is horrible. I asked to not sit near the door because of the cold and then was sat next to a window. Not the smartest choice she could've made since the place was almost empty but then again, I could've asked to sit somewhere else agin but shouldn't have to as my first request should've been clue enough that I don't like a draft.

For $6.99 with bottomless fries despite sharing, it was definitely a great deal! Condiments, napkins, and seasoning for fries were conveniently located on the table. We had a large group of 9 fit pretty comfortably at the round booth. The manager and hosts had a blast with our group - I was just my friend's +1 to the Tech v ODU game, so it was more of a reunion among alumni; nonetheless, I had a great experience. The waitress was on point but a tad snobby at the group. Regardless, she kept her composure and did her job.  The food was delicious and hot when it came out. They kept the fries refilled nonstop. The only complaint I have is a bit more mac'n'cheese on the burger, but I guess it was affordable for a reason. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their order as well.
