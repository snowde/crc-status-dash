14,Mohammed J.,"Boston, MA",0,4,1.0,5.0,2016-04-21,I had tried it many times in Los Angeles and I'm so happy for this place in Chubbuck will open soon.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chubbuck,,,,,
17,Judd T.,"Pocatello, ID",9,12,,4.0,2016-06-08,"This review is more 'brand specific' versus singling out the Chubbuck store. Having lived in the Pacific Northwest, I am VERY familiar with Red Robin. It appears there has been an image re-design. Gone is the cartoony bird and kid centered feel of their stores. They are simplifying and modernizing their look for the restaurant, yet the menu was just too cluttered (it was the size of a spiral notebook). New, exciting offers like 'Insane Romaine' are great additions, but three levels of burgers might just be too much, even for a 'burger restaurant.' The only other complaint is the bun was embarrassing! NEVER had a bun disintegrate like that on a RR burger! Turned to mush and had to finish a sandwich with a fork and knife, felt like a dang politician. Service was 'new' because we went during a 'soft opening,' so time will tell if they can get that part nailed down. I'll give the location a month or two to settle in and try back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chubbuck,,,,,
18,Tiffani B.,"Pocatello, ID",18,1,,4.0,2016-06-08,Went to their training before they open in a week and everything was delicious.  Service was great.  Would have given 5 stars if the parking lot was slightly bigger.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chubbuck,,,,,
12,Laurie K.,"Pocatello, ID",153,3,,5.0,2016-06-08,"We went for their training and it was awesome! Food was great, service was great, we are all full and can't wait to come back! Love the loyalty program that gives a little to a school of your choice!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chubbuck,,,,,
15,Ted J.,"Pocatello, ID",16,1,,5.0,2016-06-20,"Have free reservations tonight at 7pm can't wait.. It was a awesome experience, Alex.P.. Was the best...ok",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chubbuck,,,,,
13,Nathan P.,"Pocatello, ID",0,10,,5.0,2016-07-02,"My girlfriend and I waited for a while after the grand opening to let things normalize. We arrived around 9:30 and noticed two things straightaway: the friendly environment and the stylish decor. Our hostess took us immediately to a table and our server, Nick approached the table to introduce himself. Nick's level of knowledge on the menu was impressive and he provided a ""guided experience"" to reduce perceived effort on our part. The food didn't take long and tasted amazing, great portions! I would much rather go to RR's than some stuffy, self-important establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chubbuck,,,,,
8,Naomi S.,"Carmichael, CA",3,50,13.0,5.0,2016-07-08,"We stopped on Wednesday night for a much needed break during a marathon road trip.  Traveling with family members who have celiac requires extra care, so we were thrilled to find that Red Robin has opened a location in the Pocatello area. This location was sparkling clean and had chalkboards for the kids to play games and pass the time.  The wait staff gave us friendly, fast attention and didn't wince when we ordered from the allergen menu.  We left full and feeling like we had truly enjoyed a break from the confines of the car and the endless miles of dust and sagebrush.  We will definitely return the next time we are in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chubbuck,,,,,
16,Karina G.,"Pinedale, WY",0,10,,1.0,2016-08-23,"A Tuesday afternoon, we got there a group of six people, 10 minutes wait turn into 35 minutes, groups of 4 kept showing up and they got seated, when I asked how much longer the hostess said: sorry for the wait but you are condemn to wait when you go to the city to eat, it's going to be an additional 25-40 minutes we are a small restaurant and the table we want to use for your group are still being used and we have no way to know when they will leave.  We left, we did not want it to wait anymore and told the girl at the door that she needed to estimate better. She responded that that is what happen when you when you go to the city. What a joke.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chubbuck,,,,,
7,Sam M.,"Pocatello, ID",89,57,,4.0,2016-09-18,Best salad bar in town.  Also great selection of tasty food.  I like the vibe. Great place to watch sports or have a beer.  Especially if you're traveling because there's great hotels near by,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chubbuck,,,,,
10,Corinne K.,"Aberdeen, ID",0,2,,3.0,2016-09-25,"Cool, stylish decor.  The wait staff were nice. The food, typical franchise fare. Smaller than pictured portions, lacking in fresh healthy food. The burger we ordered was 14.94 and mediocre. If you like Coors, you're in luck. Otherwise,  slim pickings on the beer list and very few microbrews to choose from.  I ordered the grilled side salad. A very few sad sprigs of lettuce, not as pictured. I'd love to support this establishment but I can't say I'll be coming back. If they would up the portion size it would help.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chubbuck,,,,,
0,Charles B.,"Pocatello, ID",5,49,59.0,5.0,2016-10-01,"Our waitress was ""Audrey"". I made a special effort to remember that name because she was awesome. She seemed genuinely interested in making sure that we had a good experience, which was important because it was my sisters birthday dinner. She was helpful when we ordered food and provide accurate descriptions. I had the ""Ramen burger"". It was interesting in that the bun is made of Ramen noodles, but it actually worked. I appreciate how red Robin is inventive with their menu, doing crazy things yet pulling it off.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chubbuck,,,,,
9,Bruce B.,"Pocatello, ID",0,7,,1.0,2016-10-01,"Not much to say. Dry burgers, old bread, greasy fries (please turn the temperature of the oil up), poor service, $30 plus bill for two. I wish we would have gone to Wendy's instead, their burger is 100x better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chubbuck,,,,,
5,Shelly C.,"Meridian, ID",26,77,35.0,5.0,2016-10-02,Great lunch for all four of us. Our server was great but unfortunately I can't remember her name. Red Robin has the best fries and fry sauce!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chubbuck,,,,,
4,Lyle R.,"Pocatello, ID",220,66,12.0,3.0,2016-10-16,"Been to this location twice now. We always sit at the bar top so getting seated with drinks is always super quick. This time our bartender I believe was ericka. She  was nice and got our drinks in a decent time frame. She was even so kind to remind us that I had signed up for the Red Robin burger birthday promotion in their system. It just so happened my birthday was in a few days.  Ordered the royal robin burger minus mayo, lettuce, and tomatoes. Just not my thing. Burger came out in a acceptable amount of time but had everything I had requested but to have. Ericka was quick to take it back and get another burger out. Second burger came out, again, it was wrong. Either their cooks can't read or she didn't listen well when putting in our order. Sucks to be that guy at the bar that keeps sending food back. Technically I am making the cooks life easier by minimizing what's on the burger.  Overall good experience even though they took several attempts to correct my order. The food was great and she seemed to try to make it right. Again, not sure who's shortcoming the issue was.  We will be back for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chubbuck,,,,,
6,MarleyRyan A.,"Boise, ID",29,2,1.0,1.0,2016-11-30,"Booth smelled like dirty rags, the water tasted like old rotten pipes, the tablets at the table used to order are a complete tease for the kids as the games cost extra money, no one offered our little ones a balloon after the cooed at the giant display of them up front, and the food tasted comparable to Burger King... Or worse. Never again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chubbuck,,,,,
11,June Z.,"Pocatello, ID",0,4,,4.0,2016-12-31,I just had the fiery ghost burger and it was delicious!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chubbuck,,,,,
3,Jeannie M.,"Pocatello, ID",0,14,,2.0,2017-08-21,"The food was pretty good. Our drinks never got refilled, and our waitress sat at a table eating while our drinks never got refilled. I understand waitresses eat too, however don't eat next to the people waiting for their food and refills.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chubbuck,,,,,
2,Batgirl R.,"Colorado Springs, CO",3,60,3.0,3.0,2017-12-27,"The food has always been acceptable but the bartender service is bad.  We have had Deja twice and both times she is very unattentive and charged us for a very flat diet coke.  We just asked for iced tea instead and the diet coke was still on the bill.  She also was asked by another server to grab something for her and Deja said ""can't you do it?"" In a very sorry way.  Coming from Colorado Springs, to a smaller town we thought service would be better.  Hope they talk to her about her service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chubbuck,,,,,
1,Teaira B.,"Chicago, IL",32,25,,3.0,2018-01-01,The food was good and the service was alright but the glasswear was absolutely filthy and the tray my food was served on was all chipped and broken.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-chubbuck,,,,,
