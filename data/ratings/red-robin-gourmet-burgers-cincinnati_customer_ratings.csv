40,Brittany C.,"Clarksville, TN",58,152,88.0,3.0,2013-12-22,"Nice new restaurant in Kenwood Towne Centre. We were seated in a half booth style section. There were employees eating to our right and left. This brought lots of movement, loud talking, and other employees came through to talk with them. Bothersome to say the least. Our server Mike was attentive and checked on us frequently. Our food was hot and came out as ordered. We ordered the Gourmet Cheeseburger, Teriyaki Chicken sandwich (lettuce wrapped with jalapeños) and a small tower of onion rings. Everything was delicious. We never saw a manager checking on tables. And one never asked us how our meal was. Will go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cincinnati?start=40,2.604,2.604,2.604,2.604,2.604
35,Natalie Y.,"Cincinnati, OH",10,99,59.0,2.0,2014-02-08,"I love Red Robin....so I was really excited to try this location.Instead of using buzzers to notify you when your table is ready they send you a text message.Wait for a table was not bad all for a Saturday evening(20 minutes).But as soon as we sat down to open our menus our server was right there to take our drink   my opinion that was too quick and she never offered to tell us what drinks do they have.She was nice but too much in a rush for the rest of the meal there. My son and I order bacon cheeseburgers and bacon was so limp and thin. Manager replaced the bacon and some pieces was burnt and it was cold . Obviously not made fresh.I can say my burger was nothing special.I see they downsize servings of fries but they ""bottomless""so can not complain much about that.Overall I doubt I be back.I rather drive to West Chester.

39,Jennifer N.,"Cincinnati, OH",66,124,7.0,4.0,2014-02-12,"I found this Red Robin a bit different from other Red Robin restaurants.  The lights seemed dimmer, it lacked the huge Red Robin near the kitchen, there wasn't any video games as you came into the entrance. Did I mind?? No of course not....... Just a observation....... I also noticed the fries were served in silver containers ( maybe that is new at all Red Robin's) The food was delicious as always and I had no complaints.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cincinnati?start=20,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.736
42,Mike G.,"Cincinnati, OH",6,43,5.0,2.0,2014-05-14,"I took my mom here for Mother's Day and it was a bad choice. First, we had to wait to be seated for dinner because they had a whole back section of the restaurant closed apparently due to being understaffed. The restaurant looked a bit unkept and it took a longer than normal time (6-10 min) to get waited on from a less than enthusiastic waitress. So, about 45 minutes later our food finally arrived. My mom's bacon cheeseburger had one measly piece of tissue paper-thin bacon that I would've given to the dog at home. Mom complained, and the waitress did offer to return it to the kitchen for another, but mom's heard enough horror stories about that, so that wasn't an option. My riblets and clucks(chicken tenders) left a lot to be desired to, as I had two small tenders and a handful of pitiful rib tips that, all together, might've made one good spare rib... maybe. They advertise unlimited baskets of fries, but I was pretty much done with my meal before the second order of 10 fries came out. Overall, service was slow and the food was subpar; not a good value for the money. We had a similar experience at the Florence, KY restaurant last year, so I won't be going back. FYI they give you a survey on your receipt and I filled mine out and asked to be contacted. So far, I haven't received anything but a reply email thanking me for filling it out. Update: today, 4 days later, I received a call from the manager and was offered condolences and a gift card. I still don't think I'll go back though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cincinnati?start=40,2.472,2.472,2.472,2.472,2.472
25,Jon S.,"Cincinnati, OH",10,22,8.0,2.0,2014-06-29,"This place is all flash and no substance- even for a chain. I don't mind that it's a chain, but when your stated specialty is ""Burgers"", you'd better do them beautifully.  And while they do have a long menu of novelty burgers with a wide array of toppings and sauces- the burgers themselves appear to be frozen, manufactured and tasteless.  If you want a stack of interesting toppings and 'all-you-can eat' fries, you may be happy here. But if you want a fresh, delicious burger, maybe go to Five Guys.  I'm guessing RR hopes that the bottomless fries and drinks will cover up their ultimately boring beef patties.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cincinnati?start=20,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44
23,William K.,"Cincinnati, OH",11,158,36.0,4.0,2014-07-30,"I consider myself to be a burger aficionado and I both live and work in the 'Wood so it was inevitable that I'd stop in here.  I ate at the Mason location a lot when I worked out there so I had an idea of what to expect.  I was wrong as this location gave me a pleasant surprise.  It actually has some atmosphere to it!  The location in Mason feels like a slightly grown up Micky D's. Good burgers was my expectation and that's exactly what I got.  The only thing I take issue with RR on is that they won't temp a burger below medium.  Had the Bacon Cheeseburger with Chili Chili Cheese Fries. The burger was on a soft, fresh bun.  A perfect medium.  The bacon was cooked just right and unlike other reviewers I thought was adequate both in thickness and portion.  The LTOP was fresh.  They use a good quality mayo. I'd never had the Chili Chili Cheese Fries before and they were really good!  The chili is, to be perfectly honest, lackluster.  Not a lot of flavor.  It tastes almost exactly like Wendy's chili.  As for the rest of it, AWESOME!  Loads of cheese, bacon, fresh jalapeno slices and steak fries with that fantastic seasoning.  I actually didn't get to eat my burger until a couple hours later (and it was still great) because that HUGE portion of cheese fries filled me up!  Big enough to share. I sat at the bar and was taken care of by Louie.  When you show up during the last hour to eat at most places your service suffers as they're working on closing the place up.  I kind of expected that but that's not what I got.  The service was spot on!  Attentive but not intrusive.  We talked for a bit and he is not only professional but very personable as well.  After years in the industry I really appreciate seeing someone who gets it and works for their guests.  Not only do I recommend this location but I recommend preferentially sitting at the bar when Louie is there.  Great job! Not gourmet.  That's just pretentious.  Comfortable.  Solid.  Really solid.  I will be back many times I'm sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cincinnati?start=20,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997

After grabbing a few things in the mall my husband and I decided to stop in for some dinner. The first thing that struck me as weird was something that the host said as he was walking us to our table ""Let me put you guys somewhere where there are no screaming kids or birthday parties going on"" Um ok. We were sat in the bar area. Our server/bartender seemed to be very busy and was constantly getting sat. We hardly saw him during our entire meal. I needed/wanted some ranch dressing and never saw him to ask. Service was extremely slow. Food was ok, fries were so-so, burger was good except for the soggy bottom bun.

21,Elyse F.,"Cincinnati, OH",44,358,873.0,1.0,2014-09-21,"I really hate giving businesses 1 star reviews. After receiving room temperature food, then being forgotten, I am inclined to do so. Things started out fine. We were promptly seated. In an average amount of time the waitress came and took our drink orders. When she came back, we ordered our food.  The food we received was room temperature. The cheese on my burger didn't even melt. On top of room temperature, stale and hard is how I would describe the fries. I ordered the Whiskey River burger with extra sauce on the side. The order of extra sauce was to dip my fries. Half of the extra sauce had to be added to the burger because it was so lacking in flavor. I will give it to them that my burger was medium as I had ordered it. My daughter's mac n' cheese didn't fill the bowl, and yet there was cheese sauce covering over half of the side. This is something the kitchen should have whipped clean before the tray was sent out. Both of my children's food was also room temperature. After my son was done, I put my fries on his plate and asked for a refill. Bottomless steak fries and all. My hope was that the fries would be hot and fresh. Best I can say is that they were warm.  Our waitress was relatively attentive until she just stopped. I saw her going to other tables, so she wasn't on break. Someone who looked like they may be a manager came over and took our trays. About ten minuets after he took out trays, he came back and asked if we were waiting for something. It kind of had a tone, as, why are you taking up my booth? After informing him that we were waiting for the check he said he would go get it. Several minuets later he returned with our check. I already had my card out, so he said he could take it and offered to get me a free drink to-go. I didn't ask for anything extra. Normally, when a manager knows that someone has been treated poorly, they apologize and offer to comp a dessert or something more substantial. There also was no, sorry for the wait. A drink TO-GO, seemed rude. It felt like he was saying, get out.  I particularly took offense because my children were very well behaved. They were not screaming like the other children. Other screaming children who were given balloons, and my well behave children were not.   I did make sure to get them balloons on the way out. Good behavior should be rewared.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cincinnati?start=20,2.212,2.212,2.212,2.212,2.212

29,Mitch G.,"Maineville, OH",110,35,9.0,2.0,2014-12-17,"We  were made to wait on a table when we could clearly see past the hostess that almost half the restaurant was empty. When I finally said we'd just go somewhere else we were magically seated. The waiter was nice enough and seemed to be new and in need of assistance. After another lengthy wait the food arrived. The burger and fries that we'd waited on were now room temperature at best. I have no idea how long it had been sitting in the kitchen, but it obviously had been a while and wasn't under a heat lamp while there. The waiter apologized and sent it back where upon someone else brought it out piping hot and looking like it was ready for a photo shot. No one checked back to see if it was to our liking and It was good, but the whole experience soured our meals.  Our waiter returned to bring us the check, no apology, offer of a discount or dessert, nothing. We felt like we'd ""bothered"" the whole establishment. My one and only trip to this location leads me to believe that it will be as short lived here as the merchant that was in that spot a year ago. They only had business because of a mall environment and the food court was packed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cincinnati?start=20,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44

Nobody at the hostess station and with a weather alert for ice we were wondering if they were getting ready to close. We sat in the bar. The bartender was very friendly. We ordered drinks and took awhile to look over the menu. There was plenty of seating. We ordered an appetizer. Then finally decided. I ordered a burger med rare and was told they do not cook burgers med rare I asked for his recommendation because I can't eat well done beef .  I was impressed with his fast and courteous handling of my question. Our food was very good. He delivered perfect service. While watching the bar tv a questionable program came on snd I assume the manager asked if we wanted to continue watching the program we said yes we were more than ok with the subject matter.  I work in food and beverage so I can be a bit picky. I was very happy with everything and have no complaints ( only thing not perfect was ladies room had toilet paper strewn everywhere, but with no female workers in evidence they get a pass for not knowing or fixing the messiness... how would they know ?)

The entire piece of (chicken?/muscle?/tendon?) totally grossed me out and when I think back to it, I want to gag. Unfortunately, it ruined Red Robin for me and I probably won't ever be back.

The burgers are delicious and made to order. you can get it from rare to burnt well done if you like it that way! :-) my favorite is the bacon cheeseburger, simple and a classic but oh so good. The steak fries are also amazing and not to mention they offer bottomless fries so you can have all you can eat!  I personally like to eat mine with their poppyseed honey mustard. They also have a full bar and great milkshakes if you were a burgers and milkshakes type of person. The dessert menu also has really great options.  Word to the wise though since this place is located in the mall, I would try to avoid late nights on a Friday or Saturday or maybe even a Sunday because this place can get pretty packed pretty quick.

Then when we did finally get our food they brought out 4 meals and said ""we will be back with the rest"" and returned with the rest of the meals 15 minutes later! Our waiter obviously needed help or a boost of morale, and there was a manager present & he did not seem interested in us or the restaurant in general.

After waiting for service for 10 minutes we decided to go to the hostess about getting a table in the dining room. And this is when it got uncomfortable! We were seated at a table that had a full iced tea sitting on it, instant red flag. After a few minutes (and no server) we where greeted with a ""did they sit you at my table?"" From a very sweet old lady who was just as confused as us! As we walked out, it's easy to understand food runs the restaurant game, but service is your first and last impression.

The burgers are and they are consistently great, with my standby being the Shroom Burger. It has THE most mushrooms of any burger ever and a mushroom burger is the burger I've ordered everywhere since I had teeth. Likewise, their fried mushroom appetizer is the best I've had, with a super light, crispy batter. But.... Then comes the atmosphere & service. Being in the mall, this location is smaller than most RRs & has two awkward entrances, one from the exterior & one from the interior of the mall. Each has a hostess stand, but no one ever seems to be in proper attendance of it & servers breeze past & just look at you as if to say, Best of luck to you! Not the best first impression. Being in the mall, you would think it would always be super crowded, sometimes yes, but even at off times, wait time once seated to be greeted by a server is still 10 to 15 minutes. In the handful of times I've been there, without fail I've always wondered if someone forgot to tell our server we were seated, if a server wasn't assigned to our section, was on a break, etc.  It's a toss up if food will come correct to the table. In one instance, my burger, which has a Parmesaen garlic butter, as written on the menu, came without. The server reported back that the cook said it didn't come with such a thing & wouldn't redo the burger until I showed the server the menu. Carry out has also been wrong, with overcharges & only half of a two pick app given. Additionally, my husband had signed up for his free burger in his birthday month, but when the server went to input the code, couldn't get it to work, nor could management. Even with ID proof, they would not allow the free burger and just shrugged it off and charged us, which I thought was poor customer service, given the program promise.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cincinnati,,,,,

We arrived right before the evening rush Friday June 10th. There seemed to be confusion on seating arrangements. I got the impression they were short staffed, so I was surprised when they fit us in.  What transpired from there was full of disappointment.  We a woman serving who apparently was not a server and just happened to work in the restaurant. She had no idea how to take drink orders and very little knowledge of the menu.  The lighting was poor where we sat and my father ordered what the Marco Polo, which looked to him like a burger. He even ordered it medium well. We saw the woman right down everything he said. I ordered the chicken brusheta with extra brusheta. Once again, she wrote this down. My kids order miraculously was correct.  It seemed like everything we requested fell by the wayside because we never had an official server. The four of us were each separately brought our drinks. My daughter's side was brought before her meal and then when her meal arrived the same side was given to her again. Finally, our food arrives and my father is given a crispy grilled chicken Marco Polo. We flag down anyone available,  since we still have no server after almost 45 minutes. We're then told what was ordered was a chicken sandwich. I ask if he asked for a medium well burger, why would you not come back and ask if it was a mistake or not. I get a blank stare in return. I then inform this person my sandwich was missing toppings and the steak fries I received were limited at best.  We go ahead and finish our meal anyway just to get out of there, until the manager meanders over to ask how things were going. I told her below average and the service was beyond poor that evening. After hearing everything that went wrong, she offered us a $3 off an appetizer with the purchase of an entree  card. I just looked at her in disbelief. She must've get my disgust because when the bill finally arrived she took 50% of the Marco Polo.  Needless to say I left no tip. There wasn't anyone to leave a tip for.  I'm not not recommending going here because I will go back again. Just be aware of the time you go. They obviously are not prepared for shift changes and being short handed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cincinnati,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
18,B B.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,,1.0,2016-07-30,"Keeping it simple: tale as old as time on a Saturday night, guests forgotten when the young wait staff want to clean up and get out. $25 bill. 2 people. 1 water, 1 coke. 1 burger, 1 wrap. No appetizers. Saw server twice the entire time: took order, checked on drink refills once. That's it. Not expecting a lot out of this place, but this was basically just fast food delivered. Paid bill on the table tablet, called for server for a bit more fries. Another server came and acted as though fries were an inconceivable request. Won't be back. So weird to say that. It's really difficult to mess such a simple restaurant experience up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cincinnati,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
8,Sami B.,"Cincinnati, OH",9,24,14.0,2.0,2016-08-07,"Man, I don't know what it is about this red robin but it just can't seem to get it right. Last time we visited, our server forgot to ring our food so we ended up waiting 45 minutes for a burger and onion rings, and when we decided to give it another shot today, our burgers were waaaaay over cooked and it took over 25 minutes to get a replacement. We ended up taking it in a box to go because we were sick of sitting there. They seem perpetually understaffed, and while the food is good (when it's cooked properly) is honestly prefer to make the drive to Florence for some better service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cincinnati,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
11,Betty V.,"Cincinnati, OH",4,51,10.0,4.0,2016-08-10,"This was our first visit. I had the Tavern cheeseburger. It was cooked perfectly and nicely seasoned. I was glad that I asked for the special sauce on the side. It was just ok. I prefer mustard. My companion had the gourmet bacon cheeseburger. she was really, really happy with it. The french fries were meh. Frozen thick cut. Not awful, but not great.    Service provided by Daniel was efficient and friendly.

6,Sandra H.,"Cincinnati, OH",20,85,354.0,2.0,2016-12-01,"We entered about 11:30am. Waited 45 minutes for our order. The server said the delay was due to ""a large to go order"".  The server wanted to go into a long song and dance about the ""new tech machine"" on the table and I said I wasn't interested. He said all restaurants will have these eventually. To me, it's a way that the sever doesn't have to interact with guests. A huge minus for me, and am thinking maybe it's good that machines won't expect a tip. Never saw the manager. Food was good, despite essentially no interaction with the server.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cincinnati,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8
2,Stephanie F.,"Cincinnati, OH",54,63,105.0,3.0,2017-03-26,"I'm a fan of Red Robin. This location in particular is nice because it's part of Kenwood mall so it's a convenient stop if you need a break from shopping.  I always order the same thing- California chicken sandwich and fries with campfire sauce. The chicken is grilled and juicy and it comes with guacamole, cheese, bacon and tomato. It's full of flavor and the portion is large. Yay for leftovers. They offer bottomless fries but I'm usually so full, I don't need them.  The campfire sauce is where's its at. Ask for a side to dip your fries. It's a mayonnaise-y barbecue-y type mixture and it's outstanding! Here's what I don't love about this location. For whatever reason, something always goes wrong when I'm here. It's never a huge deal but it's odd that it happens EVERY time I go. This time they forgot to bring our milkshake, and my sandwich came out 5 minutes later than everyone else's bc it got dropped in the kitchen.  Again, never a huge deal but to consistently have negative experiences is a bit of a bummer :/ Great food, okay service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cincinnati,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72
15,Bearcat G.,"Cincinnati, OH",0,34,24.0,2.0,2017-04-29,"This our 3rd time at this location in the last 6 months, and it seems to get worse each time. Our kids like to come to Red Robin and keep asking to go, or else we would never return to this one. The fries come out cold, the steamed broccoli are obviously microwaved because they come out rubbery. Even the second batch of fries came out barely warm despite us waiting at least 15 minutes. I was hoping they were frying a new batch but that clearly wasn't the case.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cincinnati,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64

3,Karen P.,"Springfield, OH",3,74,6.0,2.0,2017-11-27,Stopped in during Christmas shopping- this place is a mess! Hostess was confused where to seat us ( just me and hubs) - so seat us by a large party with screaming crying kids!!!! The server was slow to get our order and really only stopped by once after our food was delivered. I had the teriyaki chicken - big mistake! Bun was so soggy that I ate chicken and pineapple!!! Hubs burger was lukewarm but ok.  Paid at table side kiosk. Won't try this Red Robin again!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cincinnati,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
