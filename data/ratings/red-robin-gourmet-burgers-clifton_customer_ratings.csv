117,Jennifer L.,"Windermere, FL",290,349,259.0,4.0,2012-01-03,"When I crave a greasy burger from a chain?  Red Robin is where you'll probably find me.   My favorite thing about RR, other than the fact that they'll bring you a basket of unlimited fries as an appetizer, is that they'll customize everything.  No mayo, no butter, awesome.   Second favorite thing?  They have buffalo meat!!  In a slight attempt to still keep an eye out on what I'm eating, I always choose buffalo meat whenever it's offered (yes, even with a basket of fries lol).  Theirs is always pretty good.   Third?  The banzai burger!! Terikayi and pineapple on a burger are heaven.  Pair that with a buffalo patty instead of beef, no mayo & no butter on the bun...and you have yourself a happy girl right here.   Service has always been great, which I hate to admit always surprises me.  Never wait for more than a minute when we ask for something.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-clifton?start=100,3.64,3.64,3.64,3.088,3.6400000000000006

I hate that this very good Red Robin requires me to cross tolls & drive in NYC traffic from Queens (not to mention that crazy turn around on NJ 3 East).  Why can't the one in Long Island take a cue & be more like this one?  They had space, they weren't condescending jerks & the employees were friendly and accommodating.  Oh, and we were there at lunch time on a Friday afternoon & had NO WAIT AT ALL.

128,Vee H.,"Buffalo, NY",1,82,,4.0,2012-06-05,"I love burgers. Period. So why wouldn't I love this place? Honestly, I usually skip most of the fancy burgers and order the bison or turkey burger. I find that the more I try to add or change - no cheese, medium well, etc - the more mixed up the order arrives. I keep it simple and order the grilled turkey burger nowadays, which is (usually always) absolutely delicious. The best part: chipotle mayo. *sigh. I might ask for some on the side just to send it off for analysis. Really. I know everyone loves the unlimited fries but I've never cared for them here, oddly enough. I LOVE that they now allow side substitutions - I get the coleslaw or side salad with ranch. I'm tempted to ask for the melon but am scared to find out what type of melon Red Robin has lying around? I can't imagine many people ask for it. My complaint: what happened to the spinach and artichoke dip?? It used to be thick, stick-to-your-chip ridiculous good. Now, it's thin, runny and smells funny. I'm not sure what happened to the recipe, but it's awful. I'll never order it again and it sadly used to be one of my favorite starters anywhere. This was one of the few times I've ever ordered something and didn't eat it after just a few bites. Yuck. :P Sure - the place sometimes could use some extra cleaning. The women's restroom on weekends looks like it was hit by a hurricane. It goes without saying - lots of kids if you don't sit by the bar. Service is pretty good - lots of young servers - but am I the only one a little annoyed that you don't get 5 minutes to eat your appetizer before your burger arrives?  Red Robin: bring back the dip please!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-clifton?start=120,3.76,3.76,3.76,2.576,3.76

I guess I was expecting a thicker, juicy burger.  I did like that they offer a few types of buns to choose from. reasonably priced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-clifton?start=100,3.68,3.68,3.68,2.248,3.6800000000000006
105,Laura P.,"Rutherford, NJ",14,79,26.0,2.0,2012-07-28,"This place has been steadily going downhill for awhile. You used to have to wait to get in. Now you walk right to a table. It's a haven for families and smelled like urine this evening. While the smell was new, the shift towards children is not so if you're not a fan of that sort of thing, skip this Red Robin's.  The steak fries are straightforward. They still give you unlimited ones with your burger, and the special seasoning remains on the table. I've gotten a salad or veggie burger in the past but tonight I opted for a meat burger. It had guacamole, bacon, cheese, lettuce, onions, and tomatoes. I was expecting a hearty, oozy, carnivorous feast. Instead, it tasted like nothing until I hit a bacon shard.  Not worth the calories at all. I ended up leaving half the bun and just eating the unexceptional patty. My diet soda was bitter like they didn't put enough syrup into the machine. My partner said his Peppercorn burger was good. Not the best one ever but not awful. Our bill for two burgers and two sodas was $26 before tip so that's a plus - it is economical. Service was good, too.  However, you can get a better, bigger, fresher burger down the street at the Tick Tock diner for the same price. The fries aren't unlimited there but we didn't bother with a second helping anyway.

108,Mary N.,"Verona, NJ",462,255,491.0,4.0,2012-08-06,Excellent! My husband loves burgers and this was a last minute decision to go there after a movie. My husband ordered the pigged out burger which he thought was great. It comes with bottomless steak fries which was a plus. On every table they have a shaker of Red Robin Seasoning for your fries and salads that was excellent!  We shared an order of mozzarella sticks as an appetizer ( which btw was only $2.99!!!) and I had the French onion soup and a cobb salad. The Cobb salad was one of the best cobb salads I have had in a really long time. The serving size was huge! I also had a bowl of French onion soup that was pretty good. The one thing I will say is that the French onion soup did not look like the picture of it online and was thrown together. For the price of a bowl of FO soup that's $6.00 it could of looked a little nicer when it was served. It tasted great but I expected something a little more like the picture online for The price I paid... The server was one of the nicest servers I ever had!

173,Richard B.,"Dover, NJ",1,63,31.0,2.0,2012-08-11,"This was the first red robin I went to, and was the only one in the area at the time. I was initially impressed and really was pleased with everything. After the location in Rockaway opened it seems like this one has gotten worse. On my last visit with some out of town friends who had never visited a red robin there was a wait to get in, and I let that add to the hype for them. Once we were seated it was a totally different ballgame. The server/bartender rang up the wrong appetizer and the poor runner took the heat for bringing us the wrong food. Once we were finished (2 hours, no wonder there was a wait) we saw the bill had the wrong appetizer that initially came over and laughed it off. We ended up being served by a couple different people, and our original server/bartender was a trainwreck. the game for us became predicting the next time dishes would break. It must have happened 4 times during our visit. Drinks started coming out in the wrong glassware, I even witnessed a server pour more ice in the same glass for a refill. A huge fall from grace. I hope for the restaurants sake that the staff has been fixed in the last year, because I KNOW the food is good, but they just couldn't handle the workload on this night",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-clifton?start=160,3.68,3.68,3.68,2.248,3.6800000000000006

139,Oriana B.,"Bloomfield, NJ",62,14,,3.0,2013-11-09,"I've been wanting to try Red Robin since that damn catchy jingle invaded my TV years ago...so Saturday night, my boyfriend and I decided to check this one out. Being that it was a Saturday, we clearly had to wait 20 min to get a table, no big deal. When we were seated, we needed a few min before we ordered, which we were given. Once our waiter returned, we ordered our drinks, appetizers and burgers (including how we wanted them done), along with the dipping sauces for our fries. The waiter wrote nothing down which usually impresses me but in this case I was concerned that he'd forget something. 20 minutes later we got our appetizer (the spinach artichoke dip, which was actually pretty good despite the measly portion), and 15 minutes after we were done they still hadn't cleared the table. It was only when they brought our burgers out that they asked if we wanted the plate removed (uh, duh! It was empty and what were we gonna do with it??). For entrées, I got the Big Tavern burger and my boyfriend got the Royal Red Robin burger. He loooved his, but mine was just okay. I was expecting this fantastic ""special"" tavern sauce, but there was barely any on it, so it tasted like a pretty average burger (plus it wasn't THAT big). I'd asked for my burger to have no pink (aka well done) and there was pink. Our waiter also forgot one of our dipping sauces not once, but twice. He actually never brought it out...And my final complaint is that we were never asked if we wanted another drink or given water or anything. So we sat there parched for another 20 minutes before anyone came by to ask if we needed anything else, at which point we just asked for the check.  Bottom line, I'm pretty easy to please, and I'm usually pretty laid back when it comes to service, but this whole experience was very disappointing to me, which should actually say a LOT.

This time I had the guacamole bacon burger done on medium and I have no complaints.

The... looked like honey mustard, but it had poppy seeds... and the Thai chili are my favorite. My choice of bun (the cornmeal jalapeno was really nice). Bottomless drinks that no one else can match, including root beer floats! Not so good: The floats were made with soft serve - vanilla only - not real ice cream. I still downed four of them, but I know I'll be unhappy about it later. We had a group of seven, and we needed multiple refills at a time, so they ended up being a bit slow to get there. I can understand why. It's a negative of my experience, but I can't really deduct for it because I can only imagine how much more crowded we made the bar. Decent: The burger. They do pink or not-pink, so my request for ""as rare as they'll allow it"" still came out pink. So it goes. Nothing terrific about the flavor - like your standard Five Guys type pattie. Unfortunately, nothing terrific about the other toppings, either. The onion straws were flavorless. I asked for ghost sauce on my burger, and for the extra 75 cents, I barely tasted anything resembling spicy. In fact, there wasn't even much BBQ sauce on it either, and that was standard. Verdict: On the better half of the burger chains, but not worth the elevated prices for what they claim to be ""gourmet."" You want gourmet, go to Smashburger, Elevation Burger, Zinburger, or many other places in North Jersey. If you want to shove massive amounts of food into your craw, for the same price you can get a triple or quad patty at Five Guys, all the free toppings, and a massive side of fries, along with unlimited trips to the soda machine.

I was out there with one of my good friends to get a bite to eat and I was excited coming back to this place.  It wasn't that Red Robin was hard to find, but its sign is overshadowed by the large La Quinta Inn sign, so if you see that La Quinta on Rt 3 East in Clifton, then that's where you need to be for Red Robin. The restaurant was sort of packed at first but it really winded down after USA won their World Cup match. We didn't get appetizers, but I did order a couple of Yuenglings after we learned that they were out of Stella Artois. No big deal personally because I am not a huge beer drinker. I asked which burger was good and the server (who had a striking resemblance to the Tampa Bay Rays' Pitcher David Price) ended up suggesting the Black & Blue Burger, which was one of 3 new burgers at Red Robin. It tasted great! It was a burger with sauteed onions, mushrooms, and blue cheese crumbles on ciabatta bread. The fries were very good too; there was this dipping sauce, which I believe was for the burger as a tangy, cheesy mayonnaise but I used it for the fries. All in all, the service was good and quick, it wasn't too loud and we were able to catch up and watch the rest of the USA game!

Previous Visits: Have dined in a few times with decent service and the food was prepared well and tasted good.  Previously ordered pick-up once before (Cobb Salad) and it was good as well. Last Week's Visit: I placed an order for take-out over the phone.  I arrived to pick up my order and they said it would be a few minutes, fine.  I waited and then was handed my food.  I peered into the bag and saw utensils, two containers of salad dressing, and a large box that had a considerable weight to it (presumably my burger and salad).  I drove home and settled in at my kitchen table to enjoy my dinner, but I was in for a rude surprise when I opened the box.  Inside the box was just my Bleu Ribbon Burger with an empty compartment next to it where my salad should have been.  I called the restaurant up to notify them of my missing salad.  The employee said, ""I realized right after you left that I forgot to give you your salad.""  So, I left my burger, and drove back to Red Robin to pick up my salad.  The employee actually gave me two house salads because he felt bad.  Well, by the time I got home, my burger was no longer hot, but just warm.  It still tasted good though.  Great flavor!  The salad was alright, probably not worth the gas money of driving back to pick it up though. Morale of the story: Check to make sure everything is in your bag before you leave the restaurant to avoid an extra trip.  The employee was very apologetic and sincere which is why I decided to ultimately give 3 stars instead of 2.

My friend said the banzai burger has a unique taste that no other restaurant can recreate and is worth coming back for. I got the whiskey BBQ burger which was tasty if you're into BBQ. The fries are great and are bottomless so the goodness never has to end. Campfire sauce is boss... it's amazing they should sell it in bottles like ketchup , I would buy it. The red robin seasoning blend add good flavor to the fries and is recommended. The drinks were ok. My friend said the dr. pepper tasted watered down.

If you drink the Spiked Grasshopper Shake in one sip like a shot it makes your forehead feel funny and makes the badge wearing servers, lack of robin dishes, and Eddie Money soundtrack tolerable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-clifton?start=40,2.72,2.89,2.89,2.472,2.822
48,Fred D.,"Pequannock, NJ",4,23,,2.0,2016-01-04,"I am being generous on this one. Our server Amy was the only high point to this meal. I went to this location a couple of years back, but though maybe I hit it on a bad day so I went back.OMG what a bad choice it was.. We had a tower of onion rings which were not bad, but $9.00 for 13 rings. Two out of the 3 of us had burgers and my daughter has a chicken dish. She said the chicken was ok, but it was nothing special. She also ordered the speckled lemonade which was a bottomless drink ,but with the way it was carelessly prepared getting past one is hard enough. For a place that is supposed to be a specialty burger shop it leaves much to be desired. the burgers themselves look to be frozen blanks. They are flavorless where you would be better off buying frozen patties at a wholesale club. There are many different ways you can top it off but it is like putting lipstick on a pig...it is still a pig. Here's is an example...My wife had a Royal Red Robin burger and I had what is called a Pub Burger. The version I had was called Fiery Ghost. The way they are listed on the menu is that they are 2 completely different style of burgers and the process is much different . In reality they look to be the exact same burger with just different toppings.. The care in which the for was prepared was disappointing. There was no care put into the process or preparation .If our food had slightly resembled the picture it would not be so bad, but these burgers were not even close .I know you are saying I could have sent the food back ,but I against doing so, because you never know what is going to come back to you. 2 soda's ,1 Speckled Lemonade,1 onion ring tower,2 burgers & an order of Ensenada Chicken..$69.00 (tip included) .That comes to $23 per person without any alcohol for a burger place.The tip was the best part of the money spent. There are much better places to go close by You can get a 5 guys burger done the way you want it fresh juicy & full of flavor for 1/2 the cost.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-clifton?start=60,2.64,2.86,2.86,2.472,2.7720000000000002

Bartender was a bit annoyed in the beginning but once he read a receipt of an individual who didn't leave a tip and left a crappy note, he became overly friendly. Seriously the receipt was on the bar for everyone to see. It was on there for a good 15 minutes when I was there. Anyhoot it wasn't very busy but the place just gave me a bad vibe. I ordered a tall IPA and their boneless wings (Whiskey River® BBQ)...for $9 you get a nice sized amount (good enough for 2 people) but they don't really cover the wings so there were some that were just naked...seriously? It also comes on a few nacho chips...they were too salty. I didn't get anything else (although known for their burgers) since it wasn't a pleasant experience. 1 and done...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-clifton,3.0,2.87,2.87,,2.9220000000000006

I have been coming here for years and have never encountered any terrible or mediocre experiences but in the past few months now there is an official Trend that the service is just flat out not good or slowly going down the drain.After giving this place another try post encountering either bad service or having the food take forever to come out, today takes the cake. We waited for 20 mins for a table and then another 15 to have a server come greet us. People that were seated after us were already served drinks and apps before us.  The waitress was not knowledgeable on anything related to drinks or she was playing stupid that she didn't know and she didn't come check on our table as she would her other tables around us AND when we asked for more fries it literally took like 15 mins and only brought out one small order for a party of 6. If that doesn't make you want to get up and leave, I don't know what will. If you are looking for slow service, a bad experience, annoyance, starvation, please head over to Red Robin's in Clifton.

36,Nettech N.,"Bloomfield, NJ",0,3,,1.0,2017-07-02,"This was my first time using curbside pickup from any restaurant.  I had not been to Red Robin in a long time but was craving a Royal Red Robin on Saturday July 1.  Their website advertised 12 minute pickup, so I ordered and headed over.  I live less than ten minutes away.  My online order was placed at 8:04 PM with a pickup time of 8:16 PM.  I arrived a couple of minutes early and parked in the curbside pickup spot - there's 3 of them, and there was one other car waiting.  The parking lot was maybe half full.  The other car had their order delivered within a couple of minutes, so I waited patiently.  Another car soon pulled in to the curbside pickup spot and waited with me.  After about 5 minutes he went inside and a minute or so later came back out and sat in his car.  Now it's getting to about 8:25 and we're both waiting.  I pass some more time in the car and finally can't take the waiting anymore and go inside at about 8:35. There's a hostess at the hostess stand and a separate pickup stand.  I wait by the pickup stand for close to 5 minutes.  The hostess doesn't acknowledge me nor gets anyone to help me.  There are several receipts laying on the counter, and I find mine with a time stamp of 8:05.  Finally someone comes to the stand and I point out my receipt, and they respond that they'll check on my order and disappear into the kitchen.  Shortly after someone not in uniform came by and asked if i was helped (manager?).  I said yes and they moved on and never talked to me again.  The other pickup customer comes back in and I ask him if he'd ever ordered curbside before and he said no, but he was as frustrated as I was.  In a couple of minutes the server came back and said my order would be right out.  The other pickup customer waited with me. Finally at 8:45 my order came out.  I asked if there was a problem with my order and the response was no but they were 'busy'.  The restaurant wasn't much more than half full - with plenty of empty tables - so i asked ""if I placed an order with a waitress at 8:05 would my order have come out by now?"" and the answer was ""yeah - probably"".  I then said that the website stated 12 minute service (didn't really expect that) and he said there was a third party website that processed the orders.  Yet the the ticket on the counter was printed at 8:05!  He finished with ""look I just work here"" to which I responded ""well then pass it on"". That being said when I got home 10 minutes later the burger was hot but the fries were cold. Curbside pickup doesn't work anywhere close to what is advertised and I would NEVER use it again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-clifton?start=20,2.76,2.82,2.82,,2.796

NOT this is NOT what a Gourmet burger should be like. A FROZEN sliver of a burger piled high with shredded iceburg lettuce. The menu boasted this big beautiful burger with a nice juicy appetizing punch line that got my hubbys mouth to a Mouth-Orgasm just waiting for his order. Nope not even close his sister who can't cook for the life of her would've made a better burger. The burger was nowhere near gourmet quality and seriously lacking any kind of taste, when you have to douse it with a 1/2 a bottle of ketchup to bring it alive there is something wrong!  My PRIME RIB DIP, Red Robin are you kidding me, this was dried up LONDON BROIL, where do you get of trying to pass off this sandwich as prime rib, did you know I am the QUEEN of STEAK, I know my steak! Horrible tough chewy GREY london broil meat with au jus being Onion Soup Mix BROTH! Yuck just YUCK The only thing going for them is their steak fries and onion rings Then again NOT because the after effects of a swelled belly full of gas was not pleasant poor hubby suffered as well as me but it was a good competition for sure!

Our waitress went above and beyond so thanks to her I added the extra star.  Today was Tavern Burger Tuesday in which you get a free tavern burger of your choice ($6.99 value) with the purchase of another burger and two beverages. There were three of us and we ordered buffalo wings to start, two tavern burgers - one was the mac n cheese style, and a Royal burger. Also ordered a soda and 2 beers.  Wings came out, yummy as usual, but then there was this long wait for our burgers to arrive. Place wasn't jam packed, but it looked like our waitress was covering both the front and back of the house. Those who come here know it's not a tiny place so imagine this woman having to go back and forth all over. Our burgers finally came out and here's where it all went downhill. My mac n cheese tavern burger was cold, not warm, COLD, but the substituted fruit salad was fine. The mac n cheese felt like it was scooped out of a fridge container and placed on top. My mother's burger was cold and her fries were room temp. My father's Royal and fries were fine. I literally asked the waitress to please take her finger and feel this. She did and apologized profusely saying this is honestly cold and unacceptable. She removed both trays and we waited for our replacements. Twenty five minutes go by and now we are getting annoyed. My father already finished his meal and we were still waiting. The waitress noticed and came over again apologizing saying she will have the meals checked on and will talk to her manager. The burgers come back out and now mine is served with fries, not the fruit salad I substituted for more money and my mother's burger was identical in temp if not colder than before. Her fries were cold and mine were hot. The cheese actually rubberized on hers.  Before the waitress could even walk away my mother said she's done. Over it. The waitress apologized again and brought her out hot fries and we simply asked for the check. Waitress said she will have this rectified and came back to tell us our entire order was covered and nothing was due. We got up and heavily tipped the waitress as we weren't looking for a free ride here, we just wanted our food we ordered at a reasonable temperature and timely.  We never met the manager to thank her or voice our concerns, but our waitress was exceptional. I don't know if this was an off day or what have you, but we will wait a while to return to try again. (Table next to us had problem with their burgers too)  Overall we typically enjoy it here and service is always great.

15,Charlie P.,"Garfield, NJ",0,2,3.0,1.0,2017-10-11,"This is the second time at the Red Robin Clifton and in both cases service was TERRIBLE.  Does not deserve a rating. 10-9-2017. On my last visit, bathroom no TP in either stall, could you imagine. Told staff they looked at me like I had three heads. Was seated at the table and forgotten. Had to go look for the server. Server took order and got lost, went and looked for her again, she then came with three baskets of fries and drinks. Each basket had maybe 6 to 7 fries, not endless. I had to ask again now for forks and napkins. (On a side note the table next to us no server went to there table so they got up and left, the manager tried to stop them, they told him good bye.) Serve never came back until the order came out and of course my burger was wrong. I ordered a double taco tavern burger. So I went looking for the manager. He began arguing with me and telling me I order the large Taco Tavern burger and I was confused.  Mean while the burger I received was a regular cheese burger with lettuce and tomato.  You  would think he would have just apologized and got me what I original order but he had to tell me I was wrong. Later he brought the burger after that No One ever came back to the table to check on us.  We had to go look for the server and ask for the check.  After looking at the check, they took my burger off but so what. You think they would have told me that and apologized and tried to make me a happy customer? Obviously they do not care at all.  Since this is the second time I has bad service at the Clifton Red Robin I will never return. I like Red Robin, I have been to the Paramus, NJ store many times and always a great experience.

My cheeseburger as well was burned and of low quality I took one bite and left it. The toppings were mushy and basically inedible. I ordered the fruit salad on the side which was not fresh and swimming in some of preservative based syrup. Hard to fathom.

The apps came out quickly and we had no complaints about the taste or temperature. Our entrees were mostly decent but the soups could use some work.  The reason for the 3 stars is because the service was a tad slow. One of our friends waited over 15 minutes for his drink refill. By the time his margarita arrived to our table you could tell it's been sitting out and the waitress probably forgot to bring it over. On top of that we had to flag down the waitress to get our refill on the bottomless fries. After ordering, we waited at least another 15 minutes for those to come out.
