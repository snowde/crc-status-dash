The wait staff is friendly and the food will satisfy your summer craving for burgers, salads, shakes, etc. Bar area is pretty big and they have some specials 8pm-11pm.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-collegeville,3.216,3.216,3.216,3.216,3.2160000000000006
40,Greg L.,"Collegeville, PA",71,747,928.0,4.0,2013-07-21,"We've eaten had Red Robin at other locations over the years and was happy to see one open up in the PTC shopping center. After hitting the movies today, we decided to stop in and give this location a try. We arrived a little before 4pm on a Sunday afternoon, so it was't busy and we were seated immediately. At first I was quite happy to see a digital tablet (Ziosk system) sitting on our table as being a geek, I was hoping to be able to place my order and pay for it through this system. Sadly, you can only place orders for drinks, appetizers, and desserts. You can pay your bill with it and you can control what song plays in the restaurant ($0.99/song) or you can play any of the games that the system offers for $1.99 (unlimited game play).  On the menu are various kinds of burgers, but you'll also find some chicken sandwiches, wraps, and salads. My wife went with their Whiskey burger, which is what she typically gets and she said it was as good as usual. I went with the California chicken sandwich sans the bun and cheese. I'm sure it would have tasted better on the bun and with the cheese, but it was OK as is. I do wish the bacon was much crisper. The kids had the grilled cheese and chicken fingers. You have a selection of side choices--my wife and kids took the steak fries and I went with the side salad. The side salad is basically iceberg lettuce with chopped tomatoes, cucumbers, and croutons. The ""all you can eat"" steak fries are wedge like cut fries and just not my thing. Service was good throughout our meal. When we were done, I simply clicked the Pay Bill on the Ziosk system, swiped my credit card, entered the tip amount, signed on-screen, had my receipt emailed to me, and I was on my way. I really liked this as you don't have to wait for your waitress and this can be very helpful when you have kids with you that are ready to go!  All in all, a good burger place and we are happy that one has opened up nearby. We'll be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-collegeville?start=20,3.216,3.216,3.216,3.216,3.2160000000000006

68,Kevin H.,"Collegeville, PA",15,168,13.0,5.0,2013-08-08,Great service and super friendly staff.  Food was typical chain restaurant quality but the bottomless fries make up for that.  Pretty cool decor inside that makes it be a place people will want to hang out at.  I also love being able order stuff and pay right at your table with the Ziosk system.  Nice addition to the Town Center.  I'll definitely be frequenting this place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-collegeville?start=60,3.2520000000000002,3.2520000000000002,3.2520000000000002,3.2520000000000002,3.2520000000000007
29,Brian C.,"Bryn Mawr, PA",70,255,185.0,3.0,2013-08-08,"3 stars for Red Robin, based on my most recent burger and shake experience. This is a new addition in the providence town center at collegeville, which is basically a huge outdoor food court with a few retail places nearby.  Seriously, there are almost as many places to eat\drink as there are to shop here!   Its a nice, new restaurant with a friendly staff and eclectic decor.  Old school pictures on the wall with a K-Pax movie poster.  Interesting for sure!  I was greeted by an enthusiastic and friendly hostess, who kindly asked if I'd prefer sitting at a booth or in the bar area...altho there are TVs everywhere, I decided to sit in the bar area.  You really can't turn around in here without seeing a TV including a nice big screen TV behind the bar...as others have mentioned, they also have little tablets on each table where you can play games, send songs to the jukebox, and even order drinks and dessert...in addition to paying your bill...pretty clever, not sure how these things will hold up once some kid gets his hands on it...or his marinara sauce...but I like seeing how businesses are embracing this newer tablet technology... All seems lovely so far...and indeed it is, but now its time for food...This is a ""gourmet"" burger place.  Which basically means they have a bunch of what they consider ""gourmet"" burger\topping combinations on the menu...not like cheeburger cheeburger where you order a burger, then pick what toppings you like, creating your own gourmet burger...altho you certainly can do that here...I think this is a corporate thing so they can say ""we have this many burgers on our menu"", even tho most of them are pretty much the same with a couple toppings switched around...Personally I don't like anyone suggesting what I get on my burger, I can pick my own toppings thanks!   I went with the Bacon Cheeseburger with American...They have several cheeses available(big plus), and I was pleased to be asked ""how do you want that done?""   which is one of my favorite questions when dining out...I went with Medium... So, it comes out and its about 4 inches tall...but about 1.5 inches of that is lettuce and another 2 inches bun, leaving a fairly thin patty to make up the last .5 inches...not exactly the big burger I was expecting.  The ""big"" burger, according to my server, is 6 oz and the ""petite"" is 3oz...I got the big one but didn't think it was so big compared to the amount of lettuce on there...It was cooked as ordered and smelled delicious, but I wasn't overly ""wowed"" by it...in fact, it was very average to me and I didn't even finish it...It was incredibly greasy, my bun practically turned to mush from the greasy burger making it a bit of a mess to eat...at 9.99, I hardly consider it a bargain, even with the ""endless fries"".  One nice thing is you can substitute a few items for the fries free, and some other items cost 49 cents, which isn't too bad considering a lot of places charge a dollar to make substitutions or don't allow it at all. Move onto the shake...they have vanilla soft serve that they mix with flavors to get a variety of shakes.  Meh...give me some hand scooped chocolate ice cream please!  That chocolate syrup just doesn't do the trick!  I got a chocolate banana...they don't even use a real banana, but a prepared banana puree they add in for flavoring...the banana was spot on, but the chocolate syrup was quite simply lacking real chocolate flavor. They do have a full bar, and I understand they have some good specials at night...so this could be a fun place to have some bar food and watch a game...but as far as ""gourmet burgers"" are concerned, I'll pass...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-collegeville?start=40,2.9560000000000004,2.9560000000000004,2.9560000000000004,2.9560000000000004,2.9560000000000004

Since it's new, I'll give them a break on the wait staff. The waiter gave me the wrong drink initially, but replaced it with the correct one later. He never did ask if we wanted refills of our drinks or ""endless fries"". The new bottomless french fry holder is kinda cute, but not as practical as those little plastic baskets the burgers & fries use to come in.  Food as is good as you can expect.

31,Andrew M.,"Royersford, PA",11,38,2.0,3.0,2013-08-23,"Nice, clean, and packed.  That is a good way to start a review I guess.  The selection of burgers are good, but there is mayo on everything. GROSS! Ok, you can get it ordered to your liking though, but by my experience, be prepared to send it back and wait another 20 minutes on your food.  The food quality is good and the servers are pretty attentive, minus getting the order completely wrong, but from my former experience in the restaurant industry; it is typically the kitchen not the server that gets these special orders mixed up.  The bottomless fries advertisement  is misleading though. I think they literately mean ""bottomless fries"" as in there is no bottom to the fry container..... :/ I'll live though as the proportions are satisfying.  It is a little pricey though for what you are getting, but in the end it's a decent burger joint. Be prepared to spend $40-50 for two with an adult beverage.

It took them atleast ten minutes after seating before the server acknowledged us and tuned on the automatic ordering gizmo on the table. I know why they have them....it is about the only way you get any service or your bill.  The food order was simple but it took at least 20 minutes. The server did stop and apologize but try and comfort a hungry 3 year old.  The meals were all good but nothing that really stood out...it is a chain after all.   As we left, the servers were all huddled around the host station talking.

I have never been to a Red Robin before, so maybe it's just my inexperience, but the burgers are pretty small. You can add an extra patty for a nominal fee, so problem solved. I started off with the appetizer wedge salad, which was like every other wedge salad I've ever tried. I'm a big fan and I suppose it's a hard dish to mess up. It was good. I had a Banzai burger, extra patty, wrapped in lettuce as my entree. It was exceptional. The meat was perfectly pink in the middle. The combination of the mayo, tomatoes, and pineapple was strange but very flavorful. It was one of those meals that you found yourself wishing you could eat more of hours later.  I have to say the service was a touch slow but I've had far worse elsewhere.

70,Thomas R.,"Royersford, PA",0,43,,4.0,2013-10-19,"Before this location opened, I rode my bike to Lionville two or three times a year just to go to the Red Robin there.   (Actually, 113 wasn't bad until they put that chip crap on the shoulders.)  Needless to say I was ecstatic when the location at 29 and 422 opened.  I know a back way I can use to get there too. They have a unique selection of burgers.  I don't remember the names for all of them but my favorite so far is the Whiskey River BBQ Burger.  I like the endless fries concept, but actually they don't give you many for your initial serving, so of course you're going to ask for more.  If you would rather have a veggie burger, they can do that for you as well.  I haven't tried their desserts yet, usually because I'm too full from the burgers.  I agree their service is a little slower than most, but at this point I won't let that stop me from going back. I'm not a big fan of the table-top Ziosks though.  You have to pay if you want to hear music or play games--really?  Last time I was there they had the payment app turned off; I don't know if it's just a bug or if they realize something's wrong.  I would also prefer a stand-alone location, but a Red Robin is a Red Robin and at last, the Collegeville area has one.  You can eat and shop on the same trip if you want.

27,Michael R.,"Spring City, PA",0,24,23.0,2.0,2014-06-06,"Red Robin is the epitome of ""average"" as far as chain restaurants go ranked somewhere between Friendly's and Applebys. They do have a few little touches that make them unique; the tabletop tablet device lets you order food and pay for your meal ($2 for Android games??? Really??) and a dizzying array of burgers and sandwiches being the biggest draw. Other than that it's really nothing special and is actually a poor choice given other options in the area. The burgers, their ""claim to fame"", are rather... gosh... average. I tried the Black & Blue burger, a $15 burger, and it really was mediocre at best. Way overpriced for a fairly unmemorable sandwich. My wife had the Tavern Burger which was basically a sad looking Big Mac type thing. Nothing was bad but it was all far from great. The real killer for me is how average the food was and how premium some of the prices are. There's better food in the same shopping center and for the cost I'd rather have dined at PF Chang's.

Generally, the food is good, though not special. The dining room is clean, with a casual decor. The downfall here is the service. Servers, when you can find them, are friendly but actual service is often rather slow. It doesn't mean much to offer ""bottomless fries"" if your server visits very infrequently.

I informed her that the food runner had given me the wrong burger and she apologized and told me she would correct the issue. She returned about 5 minutes later with my new burger, which was still without bacon. When I bit into the burger, it was cooked medium at most (I had ordered well done). She did not check back with us after she returned with the new burger, so even if I had wanted to tell her that my order was still wrong, I did not have the opportunity.

No more eating that burger for me. I'm a waitress myself. I try to be understanding.

First thing's first - I despise those tablets that you have to order with! They are filthy and inconvenient and I just don't like any place that uses them. This is not my favorite Red Robin location, as it always seems a bit empty. There are a ton of other food places in the shopping center, and RR is kind of hidden on the end, so I am not surprised. Plus with a sports bar and upscale dining restaurant within walking distance, it's to be expected that a chain isn't going to be everyone's first choice. I think if they environment were a bit livelier, I would add an additional start for this location, but I will have to try it again and see how it goes. Food: We sat at the bar and split an order of the ""shorty"" onion rings, which is a perfect size. I think the regular onion ring tower is definitely means for a larger group!  The entrees came out while we were still working on the appetizer. I got the Gardenburger and my husband got the Red Robin gourmet cheeseburger. Both were cooked well and hot when served.  Drinks: We ordered a 22oz. Blue Moon and a 22.oz Yuengling. The 22 oz. glass was a bit much and I couldn't finish it after the gigantic meal, but it was cold and poured well. I wish they had a cider on draft, as I am not a huge beer drinker for this reason! The bartender(s?) were both nice...we had two of them and it was confusing as to who we should 'report' to....one of them took our drink orders and brought our food out, the other one took the food orders.

3,Saurav S.,"Eagleville, PA",20,25,31.0,4.0,2017-06-25,"Fancy a burger with all the glory.. Then this is the place for u. Love how many options you have and the bottomless fries and salad, who doesn't want fries with their burgers. Their cheeseburger, crispy chicken and whiskey bbq burgers are excellent paired with sweer potato fries or garlic herbed fries. Did I mention they are bottomless.  The staff is courteous and friendly. Love that you don't have to wait around for your table as they just send u a text message when ready, so you can still shop around rather than hang around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-collegeville,3.24,3.24,3.24,,3.2400000000000007
9,Spencer S.,"Wayne, PA",0,31,,1.0,2017-07-31,We are regulars here and recognize that places have off nights but this was ridiculous.  We were promptly seated as soon as we came in.  Jay was our server and he stopped by 4 times telling us he'll be right with us to take our order.  4 times!  We got up and left.   I'm hoping this was just a bad night for them.  We'll be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-collegeville,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006
7,Lauren B.,"Collegeville, PA",0,13,2.0,1.0,2017-08-13,I was meeting my husband for dinner late on a Sunday evening. I asked if we could sit on the EMPTY patio with my 10lb small dog. The hostess asked and was told it wasn't permitted. This is in a shopping center that is VERY family and dog friendly. Other more upscale restaurants in the same complex allow this. You've lost a frequent customer. *Edited to add - we were served across the parking lot without issue at Champps! Better food and atmosphere at the same price point. They were more then welcoming to our dog and even brought him a bowl of ice water! Thanks Champps Collegeville!*,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-collegeville,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006
12,Billy C.,"Collegeville, PA",18,3,,2.0,2017-09-17,"I came in and was greeted immediately. I got 1 beer and a bacon cheeseburger. That's what hurts this review. I got my food, and the burger was way overcooked. People sat next to me 20 minutes later and our food came out at the same time. It's obvious it sat dead in the window. Just over cooked and dried out. It took me another 10-15 minutes to get a knife and some napkins. I ate half of it and just couldn't finish it. Really disappointed in the service and food. I wanted to pay with cash and leave. For the price of everything, I was hoping for better. Hopefully this was a fluke experience",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-collegeville,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006

1,Jaime P.,"Downingtown, PA",33,24,7.0,2.0,2017-12-26,"Tried ordering online but once I completed adding the items to my cart I find that this location has disabled online ordering...awesome. I call and put my order in getting an order of spinach dip, 3 burgers and steak fries and a wedge salad where I requested the dressing to be on the side.  I let the girl know I had a coupon for 20% off online ordering which I had planned to use but since they had disabled online ordering I can't put the code in and requested to receive the comp. she told me she'd have to talk to the manager but it shouldn't be an issue. I arrive and the girl very graciously comes out to my car in this bitter cold (the only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1) and tells me my price is without the 20% off. I asked her about my 20% off code and she said she forgot and will ask the manager and walks away with my debit card. This is when I go to look at my food and see that my salad has the dressing on it and not on the side as requested. The manager comes out, asks to see my coupon, I show him the code on the website for 20% off online orders and he agrees to take it off.  He also took my salad back to remake with all condiments on the side. I finally get my card back after paying the 20% discounted rate along with my remade salad about 5 minutes later. At this point all of my other food it cold and the fries are soggy by the time I made it 3 miles down the road to my home. The worst part of the experience was the spinach dip. I've posted a picture to show how few chips they gave me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-collegeville,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006
