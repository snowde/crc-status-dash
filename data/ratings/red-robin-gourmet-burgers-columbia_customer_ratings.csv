I ordered thw guac bacon with no mayo...there was no guac and extra mayo on my burger, but our server didnt come back to the table even with pushing the server button. Everyone was nearly finished with their food when we were able to flag down another server (several passed but were not paying us any mind). He took the burger, and brought out fries and drink refills for the table. Our server finally came back to the table to ask what was wrong with the meal. She didnt really seem to care anyhow.  The manager brought the burger out but we had requested it to go since everyone was finished....for some reason it took another 15 minutes to put it in a box. Everyone else was happy with their food which is why it gets a three star, and the other server that came to our rescue gave a star boost.... The servers in general need to be more aware of their surroundings and make more frequent trips back to their tables. As a server, you should make sure the order is right before you take it to the table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbia?start=20,3.32,3.32,3.32,2.7640000000000002,3.3200000000000003

16,Ashley M.,"Columbia, SC",0,9,,2.0,2016-07-23,"Red Robin on Forum, quality is not so gourmet and worth the price. Red Robin, it was o-kay the first time I went, but this time, it was quite disappointing. Yes, I expected my meal to take a little while, but I didn't expect my appetizer to come and be disappointed at the proportion and take forever as well. I was 3/4 done with my drink (water with a lemon) which I sipped slowly. Our main dishes, our burgers took almost 30+ mins or so to finally arrive,because the appetizers orly chips and salsa also took about that amount of time....and well... presentation was lacking. First off, my burger, was so greasy, it was quite disgusting. I couldn't taste the smokey and spices ketchup or even the bacon that was cooked to be crisp. I tried to eat some more, but I just could not even try anymore to even eat half of it. I ordered a side of their fruit dish and it did not look fresh. I ate some of the apples, atleast what I thought were apples. The fruits were gross as well. Overall I was disappointed. Our server rarely checked on us, not even to refill our drinks, and each time he came back he smelt stronger of freshly smoked cigarettes, and that's the last thing I want to smell when I'm eating, sorry, I'm not a smoker, so yes, I'm not fond of this smell. He forgot some of our dipping sauces we ordered and still charged us for it. Our server also took a while to come when our machine went down to pay. The server mixed up our check and dishes as well when we split it with another couple. I believe in tipping a good percent, and we did, even though I felt the service should not have gotten the tip with such a disappointing service. Sigh. What's worse is I got such bad heartburn and sickness from eating even a little bit of my meal, I threw up! Then the other couple we were driving with all said they had heart burn really badly. Honestly, I'm wondering if they use fresh grease or if they overly grease the griddle or whatever because, honestly, felt like eating pure grease where you can barely taste the meat and seasoning. I guess if you like that, this is the place for you, but as for me, I would not return to this red robin again.

There was no host at the front to seat us and there were three employee who looked and walked by us and just continued on their way. Almost ten minutes later the host shows up with an apology. We were seated at a unusual booth between the kitchen and the restrooms and this was the only one awkward booth and there were plenty I MEAN plenty of other booths and tables to sit. We asked to be moved to a booth near the window. The window area need much attention. There were dead flies and other insects around the blinds and along the bar by the windows was also very dusty as well. I liked the fact that I could order my veggie burger (soy based or garden rice and cheese) with any type of burger option with the veggie burger being substituted. The endless bottomless fries were not told to us until it was time to pay for our bill. The wait time for the food was less than 15 minutes. They are very stingy with the garlic cheese and herb topping that you pay extra for on top of your fries so if you are order that topping ask for extra and more EXTRA because they will on sprinkle it on for it.

34,Jihan S.,"Columbia, SC",0,50,21.0,3.0,2017-07-10,Took the kids out for lunch here on Sunday. It was about a 5 minute wait to be seated. Upon being seated the floor and seats were still dirty. Fruit was still on the floor and a wet mess and seeds were in my seat and of course I sat in it without noticing it until my pants felt wet. It was obvious that only the table surface had been wiped off before we got there. The host didn't even bother to check that the booth he took us to was clean and I was not offered a better table by the waitress when I asked her for a napkin to clean the booth. I'm guessing her section was full smh...Service was slow. My house salad was served on the tiniest of plates making it difficult to mix the dressing without lettuce falling onto the table. I asked for a larger plate twice and it took forever to the point where I started trying to manage with the small plate. I finally got one after eating about a quarter of it. What happened to the long rectangular plates that they used to serve salads on in first place? I shouldn't have to ask for one. I also had to keep asking for small things such as lemons and refills as it seemed to get forgotten the first time around. The BOTTOMLESS fries were tiny portions and very slow to come out. My sweet potato fries were also slow to come out. The only highlight was the coupon I had for a free mega shake with a $10 purchase for being a rewards member. The waitress had it split into two to-go cups which I thought was nice so the kids could share it. The couple next to us asked for A1 sauce and a guy who was not their waiter brought back a small cup that had a hardened mess in it which shows that he didn't even check to see if the sauce would be satisfactory before giving it to the customer. Everyone seemed to be in a hurry but didn't take the initiative to ensure quality. Our waitress was nice but busy. She tried her best to check on us but it seems that the service here is going downhill and the basic needs of the customer are not being met.

However, we continue to dine here because we like their menu and the cooks are usually not the problem. I have yet to see a manager out doing table touches in four years which I believe is their biggest issue. If they don't spend time in the FOH it allows the crazies to run they asylum. We eat here twice a month. Our previous four trips have been 2 stars on service and 3-4 on food. Today we Brittany as our server. My one and only critique for her would be to stop and say hi to her new table on your way by. She was at the table next to us when I was seated. She was caught up with them and went to the back to get them something. This put our greet time at a little over 6 mins. At about 4, I start get impatient. A quick hi calms all of that down. She was wonderful! Happy, smiling face the entire meal. Took our entire order at the first greet per our request without missing a beat. Drinks came right out. She nailed 2 of my pet peeves the whole meal. She kept the adults drinks full and she asked if the kids could be refilled. Root beer and pink lemonade are only when we are out as a treat, normally its milk. Outstanding! For the first time in 5 visits my food came out correct. No cheese on my burger and BBQ on the side. Sounds easy I know, I used to think so too. However, it took Brittany to finally get it right. Pre-bussing was good. Asked about dessert. Thanked us and invited us back.

The noise level is normally average to loud, as it is a family dining location, but it's still nice enough for date night. We normally always get the same gentlemen, and for the life of me, can't remember his name, but he's great and attentive yet very causal and nonchalant. (Which I like because he's not overdoing his customer service)  I normally always get the same thing because I LOVE my norms. I get the freckled lemonade, black and bleu burger, with fresh jalapeños and the endless fries. The only downfall is the freckled lemonade could use more strawberry flavoring, so often times is watered down quickly. The black and bleu burger is delicious! We come here nearly once a week because I enjoy it that much. It's juicy and fresh, and doesn't fall apart on me. The fries are always hot and right from the stove (or however the cook them). I like to dip them in the sweet and spicy sauce. And my husband likes the orange sauce, which I forget the name.  The cleanliness is good. There's constant business so not all the tables are cleaned off every time but they have a good system going on. The tables aren't left used for too long before a bus boy can come and get to it.
