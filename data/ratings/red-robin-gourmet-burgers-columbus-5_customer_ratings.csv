The towering onion rings at $8 is a rip off, the avo cabo salad lacks any flavor and it a waste of money. My husband had the A1 burger which was also flavorless, and the all you can eat fries you get are also just plain and boring and by the time you flag down your waiter and get a refill, you are done with your food and who wants to eat just fries?

83,John C.,"Cleveland, OH",0,8,,1.0,2012-10-07,"I'm rating this place a 1. The only reason I can rate it this high is because our waitress was excellent. The food? Well that's another story.  First off I really enjoy a good cheeseburger. Sometimes even more so then a steak or some seafood dish. As my partner and I are driving to Red Robin, I'm telling her how good the hamburgers are. I had been to a Red Robin a few years back so I was speaking from a prior experience. I think it's safe to say I won't be picking the next place to eat out at for a long time after this experience.  We each had a 'schroom' burger which is essentially a cheeseburger with mushrooms. This burger was positively the worst hamburger I have ever had, bar none. It's not just me either as my date has an even worse opinion of her mushroom burger. How they made this thing or for that matter what the meat actually was is a mystery to me but the thing was totally TASTELESS. No flavor to the meat whatsoever. Absolutely nothing! Halfway through trying to eat this thing I pulled back the bun to see what the hell was in there (all the while my date is smothering hers with salt and wishing she had asked for mayo or mustard or just about anything to give her burger some taste). As I looked at the hamburger I can honestly say it didn't even look like a hamburger. She agreed. Nowhere on the hamburger could I find any trace of the thing being browned. What do they do boil these things? The only positive thing I can say about this mushroom burger is that the mushrooms were good. If you haven't already guessed, if I ever see another Red Robin again I'll be driving right by. As a side note, after eating this burger my stomach, and hers for that matter, completely agree with this review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus-5?start=80,2.6280000000000006,2.6280000000000006,2.6280000000000006,2.6280000000000006,2.628000000000001

68,Scott A.,"Pataskala, OH",39,17,,1.0,2012-12-10,"It had been a few years since I've been to a Red Robin.  While my wife and I were out running errands a tasty burger sounded like a great idea.  I wish I went somewhere else. My entire expereince at the Easton Red Robin was a complete 180 from how I remember the place.  Our server (who also was a bartender I think) reached a new level of annoying.  I think he was trying to work on creating a cute catch phrase... or maybe his boss told him he needed to be more outgoing.. either way.. it was so over the top that I had to try my best not even make eye contact.  My favorite was his excited 'Soups On!' comment when bringing out our burgers.  We did not order soup and it was said exaggerated that it wasn't even funny. Our meal:  Fries - Since Red Robin is known for their fries as well their burgers and who can resist Sweet Potato Fries we both ordered the upgrade.  Both of were in a bit of shock when they came out.  They were cute about the size of McDonald's fries and burnt nearly to a crisp.  No flavor at all.  We were shocked that someone could even serve such bad looking fries.  When the server came back and asked if we wanted more of them (we each barely could touch them) I mentioned that they were burned and not good - he seemed shocked that we would not like them. Burgers - I ordered the Blue Ribbon burger and my wife had bacon cheese burger.  We both wanted to order medium rare but we were told the kitchen could not do that for us.  We both ordered Medium and were given close to well done.  Meat was dry and flavorless.  Mine had onion straws on the bottom of it - at least I think that was what was supposed to be there.. it looked and tastes more like the left over bits of batter after the onion rings were made.  Blue cheese had no flavor either.  My wife's burger same exepreince - over cooked with no flavor.  I remember Red Robin having incredibly juicy, tasty burgers. Overall - this place really has taken a turn for the worse.  When we ate it was 4:30 pm.  There may have been 3 other tables filled.. there was no rush.. no excuse for such a poor quality food.. or such a socially awkward server.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus-5?start=60,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006

I ordered the bacon cheese burger with steak fries and a salted caramel shake.  The fries were nice sized and they give you free refills on them but I didn't take one.  The shake was pretty good also.  The hamburger wasn't so hot.  Even though it was cooked to order (medium) it seems that it was made in a press and had the life squeezed out of it.  No pickles on the side or on the sandwich either.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus-5?start=40,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003

This time round, my niece picked this restaurant for her birthday dinner with the family. We decided to meet at 5:30, thus we're seated right away. The waitress was polite.  This time round, I decided on the Bonsai Burger. Regular classic cheeseburger, except a teriyaki sauce and a slice of pineapple top it off. A side of sweet potato fries to accompany. Results? Thought the burger (meat) was nicely grilled - slightly pink throughout the center, and juicy. The downside was too much teriyaki sauce. It almost totally masked the flavor of the burger. And the sweet potato fries? Well, I LOVE sweet potatoes, thus any place that serves good, quality SPF has my heart... And this places sticks were NOT good :( a large amount of the fries were outside slices. Way over cooked, too. Couldn't taste sweet potato at all.

First, the service was sub-par.  It may have been the guy's first week or something...but he forgot stuff constantly and was very slow.  When the food finally did arrive (after nearly 45 minutes) it was inconsistent.  Both burgers were ordered the same temperature, but one came out heavily brown on the inside and the other came out looking like it had only stopped mooing minutes prior.  The manager walked around and really did nothing to help anyone.  The most positive part of the night was the tower of onion rings which are to die for!  Red Robin's makes them the best!  Overall though, just a very average, albeit slow experience.  It's not one that would make us consider this place as a ""must patronize"" or ""top of the list"" candidate",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus-5?start=60,3.12,3.12,3.12,2.508,3.1200000000000006

I ordered my Red Robin standby, The Royal Red Robin. The burger as usual was excellent. My pet peeve about Red Robin recently is it seems they are getting stingy with the fries. The burgers are served with a side of like 8 to 10 fries. I have those finished off in less than a minute. Our sever was on top of getting us refills, although the refills took a little long to come out. I also ordered the endless Root Beer Float, which was excellent, but endless means endless.

21,Grace M.,"Columbus, OH",28,184,7.0,4.0,2016-06-07,"Not sure why I enjoy Red Robin so much. Probably because I have found the food consistent, the atmosphere casual and the menu appealing to many. All an all an easy choice when you need one.  One menue item often mentioned are the fries, garlic, sweet potato and steak cut, which are bottomless and served hot as you request more. I believeyou can also get bottomless broccoli if that is more your styl. But their Red Robin seasoning (avaliable for sale at the bar) is just too yummy with its unhealthy salty, sugaryness. Oh and be sure to look into the dipping sauces. During our most recent visit, our server suggested the bacon aoli and I think my brother fell in love. And now I must admit that I am lame and always order their bruschetta chicken sandwich. But hey I have enjoyed it each and every time so that says something for itself.  Based on location etc. there will be days you'll find the wait to be seated varies from none to 30min+, and the dinning areas can be quiet to humming rather loudly.

We saw lots of people milling about outside and inside and I figured everyone was waiting for a seat but when we went in to check, we were seated immediately. I had a simple burger with lettuce, tomato and cheese cooked with a little bit of pink. My friend had a beer. The burgers here are pretty good for a big chain. They will definitely satisfy a burger craving. AND you get bottomless fries which is kind of unique. The steak style fries are actually pretty good too. I like them.  What I did not like was all of the yelling at the customers that happens there because of the horrible layout of this place. If they seat you in the center of the restaurant where all of the 2 people booths are and towards the back near the kitchen, then you will have to walk all of the way to the front of the restaurant, then all of the way to a back corner to use the restroom.  The booths near the kitchen are right next to the bathroom. Instinct tells you to cut through the waitstaff area to get to the toilet which is super close. You are not allowed to do this. There are signs saying do not enter and if you do (and it takes about 5 steps to do so), you will get yelled at. Later, as we were leaving, they had blocked off the center aisle that led straight to the exit. I have no idea why, but when we tried to leave, we got yelled at and told to take a detour to the side of the restaurant, then to the front. Before leaving, you can hear waitstaff yelling at customers who were trying to go the bathroom or trying to leave. The wait staff seemed to spend more time yelling at people than filling drinks or french fries. There are better burgers out there, but you probably won't find bottomless fries.

Outside of their main draw, the burgers, they offer a wide array of menu choices, and while that can be either a good or bad thing, I decide to play it safe and go with the one thing they advertise to be. My choice, the Royal Red Robin, a bacon cheeseburger with a perfectly cooked fried egg on top, my favourite combination wherever I can find it and this burger did not disappoint. Paired it up with the 'bottomless' Garlic herb fries, which were the house steak fries tossed in a garlic oil with herbs and Parmesan cheese.

14,Keith L.,"Westerville, OH",50,1,,2.0,2017-02-05,"Generally, Red Robin is one of my favorite family dinners locations.  The one at Easton Town center was pretty awful.  The waitress was very pleasant with everything, but wasn't very attentive.  The major issue appears to be the kitchen.  One meal (chicken fingers) came out after everyone else was finished with their food and it was cold.  Maybe it was left on the serving line for that long, but it didn't seem so.  When it was brought to the managers attention, her attitude was apathetic.  She did bring out fresh food and it was hot the second time.  I always get sweet potatoes fries with my meal and the ones that come with my meal were barely warm, but the refill was hot. Overall the experience was pretty bad.  We were there for over three hours and that wasn't because we were just hanging out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus-5,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
12,Dave J.,"Columbus, OH",10,18,2.0,1.0,2017-02-12,"Terrible service and terrible staff working the phone. While we did order an order to go, the $43 ticket was filled out properly, but the inability to read the ticket by the staff led to half of our order being unable to be consumed do to a food intolerance issue. There were other more minor gross issues, but the problem came when we called the location for resolution.  Calling in, we spoke to a young girl who refused to let us speak to a manager regarding the food we received being wrong/ not as ordered. The person refused to listen to us and said they did not want to hear about the issues we had and hung up the phone. So it being a weekend, I have called to leave a messaged for MaryEllen at the corporate office 1-877-733-6543 option 9. I really hope to hear back as this was a place I and my immediate and extended family have gone for birthdays in the past. I don't show up with coupons (even though my email is full of offers) and I tip my servers no less than 20-25%. At this point I don't believe Red Robin cares about the quality and accuracy of what they serve. Just the numbers that come through the door. I can get less expensive crap from Wendy's or the McDonald's, even the Roadhouse next door to this place. I don't like giving bad reviews, as there is never a 100% perfect service over a long enough timeline. But seeing as how this was handled with the restaurant with no one raising their voice or getting mad. At this point I am severely disappointed with the response and find it odd that companies are willing to throw away business and word of mouth recommendations over $20 in food they failed to prepare properly. In a city like this, there are more options people have to go to and places willing to take feedback.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus-5,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
13,Emma O.,"Columbus, OH",9,84,4.0,2.0,2017-03-11,"I ventured back here, after management was kind enough to reach out to me after my last visit. At first, everything was all good! We were seated promptly even though the restaurant was busy, and our server Cameron was very polite and friendly. We ordered onion rings as appetizers and some drinks...and that's when the trouble began. Our onion rings and drinks were out quickly..but we took one look at the plates they were on and balked. The serving sides was covered in a layer of grease almost as if they had been wiped off and not actually washed. And the back of the one of the plates had a giant blob of ketchup on it. Mind you, there was no ketchup on the table in bottle or blob form. It definately was a remnant on the plate.This was only noticed after my boyfriend had stuck his fingers in it. I hate being critical after a restaurant has taken the time to reach out to me. I really wanted to like this place and give it another go, especially after the manegment tried to make my last visit right, but after the previous experience and the plates, I couldn't bring myself to stay any longer. Once again (for the last time)I left red robin hungry and dissapointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus-5,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56

I had only been to a Red Robin once before, about 6 years ago, and was not a fan. However, things have changed in a great way.  Our service was top notch, and they seated us right away.  I had the southern charm burger with onion rings. It was amazing. It was very well seasoned, cooked exactly how I ordered, and the glaze set it over the top.  Everything is very well priced.  There was plenty of free parking too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus-5,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72

Example - It took 20 minutes to get mustard. Apparently there was none on the floor. It took just as long to get a refill on snazzy lemonade and to get some ranch that was originally ordered. Overall, it was a waste of money.  Apparently the good crew members went to the new Pickerington location. Management needs to get this one fixed.

We walked in and requested a table and the hostess acted confused and took awhile to finally figure out where to sit us, the place was pretty empty. Then our waitress rudely asked if we were ready to order and she snapped back saying ""are you ready to order"", we said no but wanted to put kids orders in and she had abruptly walked away before taking the kids orders. The entire time we felt like we were an inconvenience to her. We then listened to her yell into the kitchen about another order, requesting crisper fries for the table sitting right next to us , demanding better fries. All seemed very unprofessional to do in front of customers. Overall I felt a lack of professionalism and will not return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus-5,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
3,Liz A.,"Columbus, OH",52,41,24.0,2.0,2017-09-30,"The highlight was the food,  The low point was the service - or lack thereof. My hubby got a burger.  It was good but smaller than before.  It was also a good thing he ordered more fries as soon as our food arrived as we didn't see our waitress again or very often for a LONG TIME.  I sat with an empty glass the entire time we waited for our food. She never checked with us so I could get a refill. My salad was OK.  It came with garlic toast which was a joke - 2 little pieces of thin toast, smaller than saltines.  Pathetic. It took forever for us to flag down our waitress so we could pay and leave.  And the restaurant was by NO MEANS busy.  We were seated a few minutes before 5 pm. I will hesitate before returning to this location - which is a shame.  It's very close to home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus-5,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68
6,Alix V.,"Columbus, OH",38,78,1.0,3.0,2017-10-16,"I went to this location last night (Sunday evening) around 6:30pm. I enjoy Red Robbin because of their wonderful gluten free options so I was excited to try out the RR at Easton. It fell short. First of all, there was a 15 minute wait when there were several open tables. The service was also lackluster. It wasn't necessarily bad, per se, it just wasn't up to par with the amount of guests in the restaurant. Our server greeted us and brought our drinks, but only checked on our table once. Three other servers waited on us: one for a second round of drinks, one for our meal, and one for a round of French fries. The initial server only greeted us and brought us our check.  He didn't check on us during our meal at all. He also said, as he gave us our check, ""If you want me to keep my job, give me a 10/10."" My father-in-law wasn't impressed. My FIL stated, ""it was hard for me to even tip 15%."" I felt that was odd, considering our server didn't even attempt to go out of his way to be friendly to us.  The reason I'm giving Red Robbin at Easton 3 stars is because their food was absolutely delicious! My fries were hot and fresh. My grilled chicken sandwich was one of the best I've ever had and their gluten free bun is to die for! I will always be a patron at RR because, even if their service is in decline, their food is worth it! I'll eat here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus-5,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64

2,Matt P.,"Columbus, OH",54,205,497.0,2.0,2017-11-12,"Not a place for someone who loves burgers and brews, ironically. Thus, don't let ""Gourmet Burgers and Brews"" lead you on. Granted, they don't say ""craft brew,"" but what they have on draft is what every other dive bar has. The ONLY thing that sounded decent was a Bell's Brewery Two Hearted Ale, which was not on their board of brews (don't know why.) Thank goodness I asked the server (with fingers crossed) if there was anything else on tap other than what was on the board....(oh, and ask for a pint, because they'll give you a ""giant"" as default, apparently.) Speaking of, the server was nice, but it took five minutes to see a living soul and get seated for lunch at 11:30 on a Friday in an empty restaurant. No hostess at the front.... For a ""gourmet burger"" establishment, they can't cook a burger with pink. All around the table we order five burgers, pink in the middle/medium rare--delivered all well done. A $12 price tag REALLY stings in a place like this, no matter how many free steak fries they deliver to your table. In an area with other restaurants that specialize in the same and do SUCH a great job at it, I'm not sure how this place stays open. They're good for lunch groups and have milkshakes.

Now it's dirty, food is mediocre and you're lucky if you get a ""hi"" when you walk in the door. My husband and i used to LOVE going there and always felt we got our money's worth. We used to get the onion ring tower which was huge and now it's half the size. I always get the Avo-Cobb-O salad and today the avocado wasn't even on it. We told our waiter who then had his manager take half off the price which was nice. The second to last time we were in...we left after waiting 30mins. Reason for that being the hostesses looked/acted like they could've given two flips wether we got seated or not. There were empty table just sitting with food on them and no one did anything about it.  One hostess even was laying her head down on the podium! Today when we were seated there was a dirty knife and food still under our table. Then during our whole meal we got to stare at food and trash under tables. And people were sat at them!! With out them being cleaned!! The bathrooms are a disaster. The women's handicap stale door is hanging on by a thread and my husband said the men's wasn't any better. When we left, what I'm assuming was the manager as he had on a dress shirt, didn't even look up from the podium to say goodbye to us.
