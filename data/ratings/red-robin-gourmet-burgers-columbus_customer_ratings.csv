46,Jake W.,"Columbus, GA",0,58,,3.0,2012-08-11,Upon being seated the first thing I had to do was clear the food off my seat. The waiter was prompt and friendly. Our burgers were tasty with good but limp fries. Lots of noise but that is to be expected. Price is a bit high but not out of sight.

53,Sierra C.,"Columbus, GA",5,33,2.0,5.0,2012-09-09,"Frequented the Red Robins in Folsom, CA and Rancho Cordova, CA often as that is the area I grew up in. Have always loved their fries and their other menu items. Always been a great place to take the kids. No pressure to keep them silent throughout the entire meal and lots of fun stuff on the walls and around the restaurant for them to look at. This Red Robin was not different in that respect. What really stands out about this Red Robin though is the service! We've gone 3 times since we moved here 3 months ago and have been lucky enough to have Stevie as our server twice. She is out of this world! Just the sweetest most attentive server I have ever met! We never had empty drinks, we never had empty fries, we never had to stop her to ask for something because she was already there asking if we needed anything else (but not in a hovering overbearing way that servers can sometimes get!). Upon leaving (both times we had her) she brought us to-go cups of our drinks. WOW! We didn't even have to ask. That is SERVICE! The server we had our 3rd time was great too- not as good as Stevie, but still gets an A for service.  Great team you have, Red Robin, Columbus!

I walked in and sat down near the bar, not at the bar, with my 5 year old son on a Thursday at 1pm to eat a burger and milk shake and watch the soccer game. I sat there with my son for nearly fifteen minutes, when the waiter finally walked up to me, it was to inform me that we couldn't sit in that area because my son was under 21. He said there was a sign posted near the bar. The sign was behind the bar, but not readily visible.

22,Alan T.,"Tacoma, WA",48,20,21.0,2.0,2015-02-26,"I have to say that I frequent this place somewhat often. Maybe once every 2 weeks. This review is the result of 3 consecutive bad experiences. When it's consecutive, it's a sign of consistency.  1st experience: 4 people at the table and everyone of us didn't get what we ordered (no cheese, or no bun, or no dressing). Simple server error with little communication in the kitchen.  2nd experience: food quality. Chicken fingers for the kid was mostly breading and small amounts of chicken....not being nit-picky, it was obvious that the ratio was way off. Burger was sloppy (lettuce wrap was anything but wrapped. Just slapped a 1/4 head of lettuce on the top and bottom). 2/4 of us got tummy ache after eating.  3rd experience: more food quality. The jalapeño coins were noticeably different. Instead of the breading they used before to fry the coins, it looked and tastes like tempura batter. That is fine but if u remove a bit of the batter you can see that the flour breading (uncooked and dry) was jammed in there and it was Yuky (I took a pic of it and posted it here). We notified the server just as a heads up, not a complaint at all, and the server didn't even say anything to anyone. We saw and confirmed. Server didn't take the coins back, didn't show the cooks, didn't inform the manager, didn't take it off the bill. The burger patys were a bit sub-par and again, we got some tummy aches after.  Needless to say, I don't think we will be back. It's sad because I liked this place. I think there are new cooks in the back and some servers are just ""there"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus?start=20,3.48,3.48,3.48,2.7280000000000006,3.4800000000000004

Uuuhm... can we have a table for two or are you not working here?! Then yesterday, we were offered a high table in the front area/ at the bar - no thanks. Can we please have a booth? Oh , you do have one available? Yes please and thank you! We ordered our drinks and food and it took 10min for the drinks to come. Our waitress did not once offer a refill or ask if we would like something else. It's rather like she tried to ignore us so we don't bother her with an order. Second, the food took more than 30min to arrive and it didn't even arrive at the same time! According to the waitress, someone else ""snatched his burger away"". Oh really? You want to tell me that somebody else ordered the vegan boca burger with guacamole and an extra sauce on the side? I don't think so! And why would I want to start with my food when it's going to take another 15min for my husband's food to arrive? So he can first watch me while I eat, and then I watch him while he eats? LOL! To that, my burger came out luke warm, and my side of broccoli was cold! I asked if they could please take it back and bring me another one the same time my husband's food comes out..............Ok so 5min later, both our food comes out. The manager on duty apologized and said that someone lost his order. His boca burger is warm and fresh - mine on the other hand is luke warm again and they microwaved my broccoli. Are you serious?! If I want microwaved broccoli, I can warm up my dinner from last night! They didn't take care of anything on the receipt, the waitress didn't check back on us the whole time and ignored us until I had to stop her and ask for a refill on my drink.

The bottomless fries are delicious and the different sauces are great options too. I'm a sucker for pineapple and I've added it to my burgers here and they just taste soooo good. The only reason why I didn't give five stars I because although we had a great experience, I felt like they forgot about my beer order (they did upgrade me free of charge and apologized and the manager even came) but they still forgot and also the female bathroom needed work; the doors wouldn't close, there was paper towels busting out of the trash cans and I want to think it was water running down the floor.

19,Cathy W.,"Montezuma, GA",20,5,,1.0,2016-06-06,"This review is for night shift, lunch crew and food are fabulous! The same cannot be said of night/evening shift.  We got there at 8:30 pm and ordered our drinks.  I ordered spinach dip and cheese sticks.  Our usual.  We ordered some fairly simple items as entrées.  I ordered a shroom burger.  My husband ordered a French dip sandwich.  My son ordered clucks and fries.  An hour after we got there our food  finally came out.  Mine was soggy.  My husband's was cold, seriously cold! My son said his was fine, but he prefers his food lukewarm at best.  He sure didn't have to wait for it to cool at all.  We noticed that our waiter, who shall be known as man-bun, seemed to be conversing heavily at other tables.  Man-bun couldn't even be bothered to get us straws, we had to ask another waiter, that we've had before on day shift for straws when he brought out our appetizers.  Man-bun still hadn't gotten our meal order, but he sure was conversing.  He stopped by long enough to get our order, but he still hadn't brought out my husband's coffee that he ordered.  After that man-bun went back to conversing.  I'm saying he was conversing because the restaurant was nearly empty, he had 3 tables max including us.  He goes in off the floor and tells us our food is almost ready.  I'm thinking how the h-e-double hockey sticks would you know. When he finally brought out our food in the above mentioned condition we flagged down the hostess, who is there almost every time we come in.  We found my hubby's cold mess first.  She took it back to be remade.  Then I cut my burger in half and tried to pick it up.  It was a cool, brown, soggy mess on the bottom. I sent mine back with our waiter, who happened by.  We talked to the manager and told her to just bring us the check after taking our meals off.  (I didn't feel like eat revenge food.) She tried telling me that the shroom burger can get pretty soggy.  I told her that I have had the same burger every time we have gone there in the last 2 years, never has it been soggy before and cool.  We were there the previous Friday afternoon without the drama or soggy/cold meals.  By the time we got out of there, it had been over an hour.  Our previous meals were out and done in 30 minutes or less.  Same meal each time. I will reiterate that day shift is fast.  The food is always awesome.  The wait staff seem to remember that they are waiting tables rather than gossiping.  We normally give great tips for great service. My advice is to go for lunch.  If it is past 6 you may have an experience similar to ours.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84

On Father's day it's was extremely slow, and unfortunately the service was too. Our orders took over an hour to come out, and my husband was served a salad that was mostly the core of the lettuce. He ended up not eating it, and I felt really bad because it was supposed to be ""his day"" he always makes sure I have an enjoyable mother's day. Also the floor is extremely slick.

She was very overwhelmed and forgot so much and then just the time just took forever. We were there over an hour and half and the restaurant was maybe half full. There was another server working her butt off clearing tables, taking orders and even helping us with boxes. Seems like the quality of people they've hired recently has gone way down. And it will def be a while before we go there again as it just wasn't a good experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006

1,Vee C.,"Houston, TX",34,39,92.0,1.0,2017-11-21,"As I write this review I am drinking my beverage trying to wash away the burnt char taste from my over cooked dry burger! Red Robin has always been a place I wanted to eat since I was a kid. What a huge let down. The sever sucks! He brought us dirty glasses. What kind of place is this?? I took a pic of my overly charred burger. By this being my first time I am not sure if this is how they prepare there their burgers, if so, no thanks! The onions looked so good until I bit into one. The onion was undercooked. Sigh...why can't I just get a great burger great onion rings. The orange cinnarita was decent, nothing special. The Orange Cinnarita comes with Repspoluta Tequila so I was expecting a slight buzz from drinking it! Don't order the boneless Honey Dijon wings. I am sure they are tasty when freshly made and brought to your table immediately. Our's tasted like stale honey Dijon. The server did not take them away after we said we did not like them and ordered the bone in version so ended up paying for both. He just gave us a ton of excuses about how the wings are not breaded in house, WHAT? The table was so cluttered after the app's we had to put our old plates on another table because the server brought our entrees before doing so. Meanwhile I peeled the melted cheese off my burnt burger and turned it face up for the server to see, he walks over and says can I get you guys anything else? So I finally got a manger over to the table by asking another server. My server cleared the table before the manger got there. So I told him about how burnt my burger was. Are they suppose to taste charred? He said they are suppose to have a smoky taste to them but not burnt. I said yeah it was deeply blackened in the creases of the meat. He said, have you paid yet. I said my sister paid for her food. He said don't worry I got it. That was not my goal to get the manager to pay for my food. My goal was to order great tasting food and have a great experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006

2,Food C.,"Charlotte, NC",2,33,24.0,1.0,2017-12-12,Worst burger I've ever had! I was expecting a normal sized burger but received a McDonalds sized dollar menu burger. Both burgers that we ordered we're I've cold. We sent them back and they returned with cold burgers again. I ordered a side cup of clam chowder. It was disgusting also. It looked like macaroni and cheese not soup. It was very dry and fishy tasting. We were looking forward to beer and burgers and we were very disappointed. I will not be returning to Red Robin. On a positive note the waitress was very nice. The chicken tortilla soup was good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-columbus,3.24,3.24,3.24,,3.2400000000000007
