Not to be a burger snob, but the Blue Ribbon burger is messy and needs to be all snug in the wrapper! They do a knock out job every time! And are always super fast with the refills!

The service is hit and miss, but it tends to be decent at this location. I know it's a place known for their burgers, but I've never been thrilled with them. They're just so-so. Their fajitas (yeah, they have them) are amazing, though. In fact, any time I've ordered something other than a burger, I've enjoyed myself much more.

The wait is usually not long, not even on a Friday night or Saturday night. Their food is always consistently good at this location. Both their artichoke & spinach dip and their salsa is pretty decent. I've tried a couple of different burgers but I just keep coming back to the Whiskey BBQ burger, it's just the perfect burger! Their fries are decent but I really like their sweet potato fries. They have lot's of side dishes, if you want to go all out or sort of watch your diet, you can do either. The only dessert I've tried here was the Chocolate Brownie Cake, it was decent but not near as good as the burger. The one thing I dislike at Red Robin is that they don't have a public wifi that you can use. It seems like a small price that they would have to pay to make the experience even better, especially if you have kids that want to play a game that you need internet for and you get some peace and quiet while they do.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-commerce,2.32,2.32,2.32,2.32,2.32

I finally after 15 minutes grabbed a busboy to get the manager. 5 minutes later,  he showed up along with the waiter. He said he would adjust the bill  8 minutes later, I took the kids to look at the games in the front while my husband waited for the bill.

11,Gary A.,"Wixom, MI",48,349,17.0,2.0,2014-12-13,"So its a red Robin.  Geared at a younger crowd, teenagers on a date or a young family with small kids.  Its a busy place - lots of flashing lights and noise.  The advantage is the food is usually fast and they have a couple of specific sandwiches which they do well, they have had enough practice, but I get the feeling I don't belong. So the good - Obviously they specialize in Burgers.  But if you don;'t eat beef, yes their are some of us, the california Chicken burger i s good option.  A chicken breast, with bacon and guacamole.  Its tough to mess this one up.  Service is fast, as they want you to move along, so you can get in and out in under an hour, typically under 45 minutes - even when its busy. So the bad - the kids and noise - there's a lot of both.  I get it, the parents have given up with their 5-9 years - let them run - play up at the front at the small arcade or just hang out.  The kids also get you sticky stuff - on the tables and floor - what out for rouge crayons under foot - I found 2 yellow, 1 red and 1 green.  Lunch is better - only non-school aged kids.

First all start with our server who was friendly and very apologetic about messed up order. I have never had such a dissatisfying experience here before until this day. Everything went fine during ordering. Our food came out super fast but then again the place was empty for a Saturday evening and i know why. First my sister burger was wrong it had no guacamole even tho she ordered the guac burger. This was no big deal because our server immediately brought out the spread for her burger.  Next was my burger which was the mushroom burger that i added bacon to and switched out swiss for american. Now I very well understand that when customized your order problems are more likely to occur but the fact they didn't give me one of the things I requested tells me they just made the burger with out even looking at the ticket. First i noticed it was no bacon and of course my serve speedily gave me bacon. But upon my first I realized it was swiss cheese instead of American. I wish i would have noticed it when i saw there was no bacon but my burger was covered in mushrooms so there was no way to tell. She offered to make me an new burger but at this point i was just ready to go home and didn't really wanna go through another mess up.

I was excited to come and enjoy a free chicken burger on the house, based on their Name That Chicken promotion/Santa Claus namesake promotion. When we arrived, the server confirmed the promotion was going on, and my name qualified me for the free chicken burger. I ordered the ""special chicken burger"" and then the server started asking me questions: Grilled or crispy? What do I want on it? Which I didn't think anything of, because I felt I was pretty clear on my order and we had previously talked about the free chicken burger promotion. I got my meal and it was great. When it came time to pay, I took out my drivers license, per the rules, and she told me I didn't need to show her, because I didn't order the chicken burger. What?!?!?! I didn't understand. She told me that it was called the ""No Name"" chicken burger, and she thought I had changed my order. Consequently, we were made to pay for something I didn't actually order, or know that I was ordering, when it was quite clear (to a logical person) that I had come in to take advantage of the promotion. The rest of my family (I brought 5 additional people with me) enjoyed their meals, but the overall experience was soured by the server's lack of willingness to take any responsibility for the mix-up. We will definitely think twice about coming here, and probably not come back, judging from the way I was treated. If Red Robin is going to run a promotion like this, it shouldn't be so hard for someone (who qualifies) to take advantage of it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-commerce?start=20,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56

3,Craig I.,"Southfield, MI",2,34,19.0,1.0,2017-03-06,"Disappointing. Not so good food, Not so good service. Expensive for not so good. I had the Banzai Salad. I was surprised by the description ""There's something special about the citrus-ale dressing hugging the teriyaki chicken, perfectly matching the grilled pineapple and mandarin oranges with shredded carrots, parsley and almonds over mixed greens. Served with garlic toast. 10.29"" The teriyaki chicken was a plain chicken breast with a side of teriyaki sauce. When I asked why it is not cooked with the teriyaki I was told  to drizzle it over the chicken. the garlic toast was burned black. We asked for new toast twice with no return of toast. Grilled pineapple appears canned.  There is lots of clapping, singing and cheering. There is little food quality or customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-commerce,2.2,2.2,2.2,,2.2
2,Bren C.,"Orchard Lake Village, MI",30,27,21.0,5.0,2017-05-07,"Great Turkey Burgers with ""no calorie bottomless fries""  just joking-of course plenty of calories!!! or sweet  potato  fries $1 extra--are my favorite things to order!  Love their Hamburgers or Turkey Burgers!

I wish the Fries weren't bottomless since I have O control to not re order more!!!!  They are so Good!!!! Service is always been pretty good also!!

8,Kelsey G.,"Milford, Milford, MI",0,7,2.0,5.0,2017-06-01,"Had an excellent experience at this Red Robin. My waitress (Briana) was a very sweet, young girl who made sure to keep checking up on my boyfriend and I. Our food was also great. I ordered the whisky river BBQ sandwich. What really stood out to me though was one of the other waiters. When I was looking through the cocktail menu, a very nice gentleman (Alex S*) came over to our table to offer his assistance on helping me choose one. I thought that was very sweet of him to go out of his way to make sure that we had the best experience possible, even if he wasn't waiting on our table. Overall, great staff, great food and amazing drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-commerce,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48

6,Tanish S.,"Auburn Hills, MI",0,5,,1.0,2017-06-27,"I order the Prime Chop House burger because I had eaten that burger before at the Troy location and enjoyed it immensely.  Well, at this location it was HORRIBLE.  I literally had a huge onion skin on my burger.  Like a piece of onion peel that should have gone in the garbage was on my burger.  This burger is supposed to have mushrooms.  Nope.  Its supposed to have steak sauce...I have a drop of sauce on a dry burger with a small amount of cheese.  I could not believe this was the same burger.  This was a carry out.  No napkins or plastic ware, nothing.  First and last time going to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-commerce,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28
4,Hope D.,"Waterford Township, MI",3,24,,4.0,2017-09-19,"Still good food. Although the portion size of the large salad decreased and the price increased a couple years ago, the salads are still very good. My fries were brought out cold and the waitress brought out new, warm fries for me. Excellent customer service. Expensive choice for lunch, but very good food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-commerce,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32
