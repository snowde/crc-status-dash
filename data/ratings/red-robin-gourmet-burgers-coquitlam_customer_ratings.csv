Vancouver/Burnaby already lost a total of two of them this year.  Are the birthday freebie burgers doing them in? Maybe? It's pretty much a gift certificate for a free entree and more than half the decent entrees are burger combos.  There isn't a lot of variety other than some fried appetizers, soups and salads.  Still you have got love their burger variety and dedication to that meal, if only they can stick around in the cities.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-coquitlam?start=20,2.476,2.476,2.476,2.476,2.476

They have a cute little waiting area right when you enter and the wait times are normally 10 or so minutes - not too long. The staff is very friendly and flexible, and prices are pretty reasonable. I love how they have the ""bottomless fries"" concept here; it's something that is very new and unique to me (or maybe it's just because I don't go out much haha). The first two times that I came here, I was very satisfied with how my food tasted. However, the last time that I came here, I ordered the $10.45 Red Robin Gourmet Cheeseburger with poutined fries (for $1.99) and they both did not work out for me. The burger was extremely greasy so I had a tough time stomaching it and the gravy on the poutined fries was very clumpy and cold.

3,Monika C.,"Burnaby, Canada",63,108,242.0,3.0,2017-01-27,"After they got rid of the location in Burnaby near Metrotown I haven't been able to frequent Red's as much. My husband and I got an email coupon with a ""password"" to get a tavern double burger for free if we ordered another burger and two drinks. We took advantage of the deal and came to the restaurant to see what the buzz was about.  The restaurant hadn't changed in terms of decor since the last time I was here. We started with a (bottomless) freckled lemonade and a pop. I only noticed that something was off about the first lemonade... After I had my second one. I love the strawberries at the bottom of the lemonade and I usually fish them out first. They're usually plump and juicy and it compliments the tartness of the lemonade. If it tastes a bit odd, better to be safe and ask for a new one.  My husband and I tried the tavern double burger on the regular sesame bun as well as the ghost burger on the jalapeño corn cornmeal kaiser roll. (I had to look some bun options up on google!) Both came with bottomless fries (you can sub out for other bottomless items for a price) and thanks to our great server, we never got down to more than 2 fries before she asked if we wanted more. The fries were on point and they tasted great with a bit of the signature sauce sprinkled on top.  The tavern burgers are supposed to be a spin on classic pub style burger... But it was basically a fancy name for a very very standard burger that almost seemed like something from a fast food joint. The tangy BBQ-like sauce was unique but not enough to redeem the meal. It was also quite small. Good thing it was free because I wouldn't have wanted to pay $9 for it. The ghost on the other hand was unique. There were deep fried jalapeño poppers as well as a layer of fresh ones at the bottom of the burger. The kaiser roll definitely had some heat to it too! I didn't notice the cornmeal though. If you like spicy this is the way to go.  All in all, I was a little disappointed with my visit. The burgers weren't as spectacular as I remember them to be and they don't seem to be worth a trip out to Coquitlam. I like that they sing for you on your birthday so maybe I'll stop by then.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-coquitlam,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8

We were there before 4 other families who all got their meals and were done eating before we got ours. The food was mediocre, and not worth the price.  The only good thing was the waiter.

Although the service was a bit sparse being quite busy on a Friday evening, we were checked on quite often and the food itself was hot and obviously fresh. The burger had a huge chicken breast and the guac was lacking while the whole burger was a bit too salty and haphazardly put together. The broccoli was soft but tender and sweet.

9,J T.,"Newberg, OR",1,50,4.0,4.0,2017-06-19,"Drove up from the USA to spend time with the family. On Saturday, we took in the Highland games at Percy Perry and afterwards, hit up Red Robin for for some grub. It was very busy and there were 13 of us so it took some time to get seated.  Waiting 50-55 minutes didn't seem to unreasonable but it did start getting a bit irritating seeing multiple groups of 4-6 being seated before us. Couldn't they have figured a way to slide a couple of tables together and get us in sooner? Oh well... Anyhow, we finally got seated at the back of the restaurant by the kitchen and with drinks and apps ordered everyone was settling in and enjoying the visit. After some time, I'd noticed a couple towers of rings (which we had ordered) sitting under the heat lamps. 10 minutes had passed and the are still sitting there...hmm. At one point I see at least 5 servers up there moving the rings side to side in order to get their customers food but none of them had the gumption to grab the rings and hand them to us, again, the closest table to the kitchen. Finally I see our waiter (who is a really nice guy), I wave him over and tell him that if those are our rings sitting up underneath the heat lamps, he'd better have a good explanation why they been sitting there so long. I told him that ""whatever it took, you need to make this table a priority and start getting some food out quickly!"" Next thing I know, the kitchen swings into action, our server and manager drop off newly cooked appetizers, apologize for the delay. The manager, without me even asking, says the appetizers are on us and thank you so much for your patience.  I was just about to sit her down and tell her how unhappy I was but she changed the moment completely before I had the chance. The rest of the evening went off without a hitch, the food was good, our waiter very pleasant, courteous and composed.  Great recovery and therefore a great last impression! We will be back!

1,PennyandRusty P.,"Vancouver, Canada",0,188,1134.0,3.0,2017-08-21,"I've mentioned previously on a number of posts... there was a time when Red Robin was the place to go if you wanted to find ""gourmet"" burgers. Now, ""gourmet"" typically meant anything other than a regular cheeseburger and it was also a few decades before all of the newer burger joints started opening up. Still, Red Robin, services a fairly broad demographic looking for a family-friendly atmosphere at relatively fair prices. We dropped by the Coquitlam location of Red Robin back in April and I have to say... it's almost like going back in time... very little seems to have changed in terms of decor. They have, however, made some changes to their menu and included some new burger options. Before we get to the burgers though, I started out with a Root Beer Float, bottomless and served with Barq root beer. Unlike my last visit to Red Robin, the root beer wasn't flat. However, it took forever to finally get my refill so I pretty much finished my meal before it arrived. I ordered their Pig Out Tavern Double ($10.29), said to contain hardwood-smoked bacon and a creamy bacon-crumble aioli with tomato and lettuce. They let you customize your burger and I opted to switch out my regular bun with a jalapeño cornmeal bun, which turned out quite nicely. The fries are bottomless but they're really not that great (never have been). The burger itself was not too shabby but it was hardly a bacon-lover's dream come true because the bacon was thin and there was no discernible bacon flavour to the aioli. The main difference between the Pig Out and the Big Pig Out is that the Pig Out contains double patties whereas the Big Pig Out has one patty which is slightly larger (or that's how our waitress explained it). With all of the options available now for other restaurants serving gourmet burgers, I wouldn't go out of my way to come to Red Robin solely for the food. Still, their menu is fairly extensive so you should be able to find something that you'd enjoy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-coquitlam,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76

There were only 1-2 people serving at the bar area and I felt bad for them because they have to make all the drinks plus take our order. But within 10 mins our order was taken and drinks were served in 5 mins. We got our food about 20-25 mins which was okay.

We waited around 30 mins for a table for 6.  Saw that they have a new ""Tavern"" menu with burgers starting at $8.99 so I opted for one of those--the Sir Acha Tavern Double burger! It had sriracha onion straws, cheese, pickles, tomatoes, lettuce, and spicy mayo with 2 beef patties. It sounded like a lot of food but it was actually a smaller burger and if you want the full size one, it's $11.49 (The Big Sir Acha).  The burger was pretty tasty and I wouldn't mind getting it again. The patties were cooked well and had good flavour. I just wish it had more spicy mayo and sriracha onion straws! I feel like they really skimped out on the onion straws since I barely got any. Could've been a little spicier too but it's definitely on the mild side and kid-friendly.  Service was OK. We were originally seated at one table with the little extenders out but it was way too tight for the 6 of us so we asked our server if we could get the adjacent table as well and join them together. She was able to do that and was very nice about it, which we appreciated. However, the kitchen service was quite slow and they initially gave me the wrong burger so I had to wait some more. It also took a long time for our salad and fries refills to come out. I definitely think the kitchen could use more people or be more efficient. We normally only come here to celebrate a birthday because they have free birthday burgers if you sign up on their website. Funny enough, pretty much all the tables around us were celebrating birthdays as well! Overall, the food is not bad and better than your regular fast food burger but the service could be better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-coquitlam,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96
