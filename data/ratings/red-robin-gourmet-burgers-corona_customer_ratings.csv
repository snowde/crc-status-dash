170,Olaa C.,"Corona, CA",2,8,,1.0,2013-02-05,"Seriously there are so many things wrong with this location but the main problem is the so called ""management"" corporate needs to come in and clean house! As I have always enjoyed clucks and fries I was beyond embarrassed for the the staff and other guests having to be in an establishment where the manager's are so unprofessional. I choose to have my birthday dinner here which was the biggest mistake from even walking through the door. I reserved a table for 15-20 people yes I called very early in the day spoke with a morning manager which was very pleasant, I did not want the restaurant to be understaffed on a Friday night as we walked in. My friends and family showed up at 6:50 reservations at 7pm I got there at 7:20 and was told by a hostess that they stat four ladies at the end of my added on table. Never mind the fact they knew a big party was coming in they still would not admit fault for not seating properly. The first manager that I spoke with (Julie) was so incredibly rude I was shocked how she even became management as clearly she had no business being given that title. Her ""accommodations"" were to sit half my party there and the other half over there at different tables and when the four ladies left we can all move again and sit at our original reserved table. Haha NO that's not how things are done! We had five children under the age of seven musical chairs was not an option or even a logical solution to the screw up. After squeezing our party of 18 people literally inches away from the ladies of four they became rude as well since we were so close due to seating. Yes we were given appetizers 3 that took 45mins and were burned. Then as we ordered 1 hour later 16/18 orders were wrong, ,cold, burned or raw!!! Raw chicken sandwich was ridiculous! We could have gotten very sick! How about the brown stuff that was on the steamed broccoli??  We were informed that was because it was in the microwave to long. Fresh fruit? Ya not so fresh looked like the strawberries were taken from the bottom of someone's empty strawberry lemonade, gross. When we asked to speak to the manager again they sent over (Melissa) who I'm 98% sure was the kitchen manager haha another joke! Was so argumentative and also unprofessional. Blamed us for all the terrible food because she claims when it left the kitchen it was ""fine"" fine is not good enough!! Mind you these four ladies NEVER moved or left in fact went out of their way to prove a point that they were not leaving (4 hours total). When we asked the manager to just give us our check for our beverages so we could leave and go elsewhere to feed five starving kids at 9 o clock at night she said she could remake the food but we had to pay for it! Comical right?! Especially because those four ladies had there food comped due to there complaining we were to close and they felt rushed, cant blame them hostess nor ""management "" ever took blame for seating them there. The manager comes back AGAIN saying she would take care of our drink tab lol of cokes and what not if we left now! Apparently we were harassing her staff and guests. All untrue as our server (Suzanne) was great leaving with a $40+ tip I actually felt sorry for her that she has such poor management that does not have her best interest in mind. If this establishment would have taken responsibility and take fault I'm sure everything would have been different. Coming from the restaurant world and being a training server for a professional corporate restaurant its a shame other restaurants do not put the customer first because at this location the customer is not right! And management will become unglued faster than then were able to serve horrible food followed by the WORST customer service I have ever seen!!! Great birthday right??!

We were seated within 10 minutes and we had a waiter named Blake.  Blake was a really tall guy, so he had to squat down to take our order. He folded his arms together and leaned over our table which was pretty unorthodox to me. I felt a little awkward, but Blake was very interpersonal with his job. He took our order and our drinks came out promptly. About 10 minutes later, Blake comes and brings us a basket of fries and says ""Here's something to start you guys off"". I was really surprised and happy that he brought our fries as a sort of appetizer before our meal. I was really impressed.  The one thing I noticed about this Red Robin was that it actually had male waiters. Not to sound sexist, but I do prefer a male waiter, because of style of waiting. Blake took the initiative on a couple of things during our meal, such as bringing us a cup of water when our cups were almost empty, asking to bring dipping sauce when he saw that we were almost out, and etc.  The burgers were delicious and the fries were fresh. Blake made my meal very enjoyable and I would come here over the one in Tyler.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-corona?start=100,2.68,2.68,2.68,2.2600000000000002,2.68
103,Drew H.,"Corona, CA",0,9,,1.0,2014-04-21,"I hadn't been to a Red Robin since I was about 7 years old but I went with my parents just to get something cheap for lunch that was just a step above fast food drive through - the reality is this is worse than drive through food and it costs almost twice as much. CONFUSING AND BULKY MENU: Almost 12 pages printed front and back with ads and promotions stuck in-between each page to make it even bigger. Even our waitress was confused because the menu missed details and placed items in the wrong sections, you could tell she was bothered by it and the fact that it's so massive and full of promotions instead of actual menu items - not to mention had to be turned like a book yet didn't have page numbers so you couldn't tell someone where something was. FROZEN, CANNED AND ROTTEN INGREDIENTS: The tea here is all made from syrup so it leaves you with a lingering, syrupy  aftertaste with each gulp (every other beverage has sodium/sugar). My mom likes sweet potato fries so she payed almost $2.00 extra to have those with her order instead of the regular fries. Her sweet potato fries initially looked good until we ate them and realized they weren't fried recently, they were just reheated and then they served them to her cold - my mom doesn't cook much but even she said she's had better frozen fries at home and that wasn't even her insulting the food, that was her being prideful of the fact that she can cook better than someone who is fully employed as a chef.  My fruit salad was basically half of an apple that had gash marks and dark brown blotches all over it like sticks had been jammed into the sides.The pineapple they claimed to be ""fresh"" had to be at least 5 days old as it was limp and soggy, it's not hard to tell when fruit is fresh if you eat it every day. The strawberries in my fruit salad were the same frozen strawberries they put in beverages so.. yes, that means they were pale, bloated and squishy. I didn't even try a bite of it after I saw the BROWN, WILTED mint leaves on top - you have the laziest chef ever! The main entree item I ordered was a turkey deli sandwich... Was I expecting something rotten and oily? No. You can tell when deli meat goes bad not only by the way it smells but by the way it tastes. It will have a liquidy coating to the meat which only brings out the pungent foul stench which is exactly what Red Robin's had. I gagged after two bites and had to stop - I am a big guy at 6'5 tall and I had an appetite before we got here but after I tried their food I lost my appetite and demanded a refund (which I got quickly because the waitress agreed that my food was gross - I didn't order anything else).

Our family absolutely loves reb Robin . But this is no ordinary red Robin..... it's the worstttttt red robin ever.                                                                      We were super surprised that on a Friday night at 730 we came in and there was hardly anyone there. My first thought was awesome we picked the right night,, no, everyone else just picked a better place to eat. And even tho the place was empty we still waited 10 min due to lack of .....? Well I still haven't figured that out. Anyhow to make a long terrible story short... The wait after ordering once we finally ordered was ridiculous.  The fries were rewarmed not fresh. And I'm not too picky believe me. But it was that noticeable. Limp, cold, soggy fries, with a hint of microwave heat and you got urself an awful basket of fries. My Cole slaw had tortilla chips in it. (No they didn't belong there), I ordered a margarita... um that was pretty much just lime juice. And the waitress.  She must have called me sweetie and hun 30 times... my son and I made a game of counting them out of boredom and to soothe our growling bellies. Normally if ur old enough to be my mother or even close go for it and call me whatever pet name u need to but I'm pretty sure she was younger then me. Probably in her mid twenties. That is just annoying. It drives me nuts. I think that's how she attempts to get on the customers good side but there are many more ways to go about that. Like.... having a personality.  So just don't waste ur time. If ur craving reb Robin drive as far as u need to and hit another one.

At our table the menus were newer and a bit over done with ads in the middle for drinks and apps..confusing.  The drink menu and dessert menu were so sticky and gross..didnt want to touch them to look at them.  Food came..portions are smaller and this fry presentation thing has to go.  It's made of metal and gets cold quickly which means your fries do too.  Their fries used to be so good..not so much any more. I ordered the whisky chicken wrap and it was noticeably smaller than previous visits.  Not sure if these changes are for the better or not but I liked RR before the changes were implemented.

When refills were needed she was on top of it and she checked on us just the right amount that wasn't annoying but wasn't neglectful either.  She pretty much rocked it and we were ready to hand out a worthy tip when we went to sign the credit card receipt to our surprise an $8.00 tip had already been added to our bill. When we brought it up to the staff one girl took off with our receipts and then never came back with an answer, then finally our waitress came back and asked us for our card again and took off again without saying anything.  She finally returned and thanked us for noticing the mistake...(her obvious attempt at ripping us off) and then took off again.  We will not be returning to this Red Robin and I suggest that anyone who goes there make sure to check your receipts so you don't get ripped off.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-corona?start=100,2.28,2.28,2.28,2.6600000000000006,2.28

Plus great appetizers and entres if your not in the mood for a burger.. Ive been here plenty of times and enjoy every dine in. The burgers are cooked to perfection however you prefer,well done, medium, or watever. Theres plenty of burger combinations to choose from wether it be spicy, bbq, or just an old classin cheeseburger, plus your create your own choice. I highly recommend getting the freckled lemonade as a drink if your not a soda drinker like me, the drink is sweet full of strawberry pieces and just thirst quenching. And if your into spicy get the Burnin Love burger. Its a good one.. Not much more to say.

Our server was sitting at a table chatting with customers rather than doing his job. He forgot to bring out all of our food as well and gave us extra fries to try to make up for it. There is never a manager in sight. Does a manager even work here? Their ""bottomless"" fries are total BS too. You get 10-12 fries with your meal and if you want some more you must wait 10-15 minutes for the server to return and then another 20+ for him/her to bring you back some more fries.

83,Will H.,"Corona, CA",16,211,,2.0,2016-02-26,"This was my first visit to any Red Robin in about 15 years and I had high hopes.  Let me give you the rundown on the good and the bad.  First the good: 1.  Excellent and speedy service by Travis. 2.  Super yummy mini tower of donuts with chocolate and strawberry dipping sauce. 3.  O.K. burger and fries (with cheese dipping sauce @ $1.19 surcharge). 4.  Good strawberry margarita. The BAD: 1. NO utensils from either of 2 servers who were helping me. Man, this is Service 101. 2. Happy Hour margarita half the size of those Mega gulp cocktails served right next door at Applebees, and at a lesser cost.  WHY? 3.  Kitchen forgot to add my caramelized onions on my burger, which, at $13.45, was grossly overpriced for a chubby burger and fries.... . 4.  Like many male servers these days, mine kept calling me ""BOSS"" every 30 seconds, which annoys the Hell out of me and many customers, particularly those of us who are senior citizens. For some reason this BAD HABIT of  using these nameplates like Boss, Bro, Buddy, Dude, etc. has become the norm at 75% of all restaurants I go to.  WHY?  What happened to ""Sir""....the only really viable greeting?  Have these servers been watching too many episodes of Diners, Drive-ins and Dives with the flippant Guy Fieri?  Where are the managers with the teaching of proper server etiquette across the country? In fact, where was the manager at all at this location, as I never saw one nor did one ever greet me at the table. 5. 3 of the 4 TVs in the bar area did not have the captions running, which makes them just about useless for the customers.  It was only after I mentioned it to my server that an attempt was made to correct it.  Just lazy workers and management who may have seen this situation for months or years and never bothered to take 5 minutes to correct the issue and play multiple choice with the remotes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-corona?start=80,3.32,2.8,2.8,3.1760000000000006,3.008

My grandmother's food came out cold but our waiter, Blake, took it back and the chef brought out a fresh hot plate for her so that was great. Later we found out that Blake even got it taken off the bill for us, which not everyone does so that was appreciated. My moms burger was well done but like super well done to the point the meat was pretty dry. Blake recommended the burger though which she enjoyed other than the over cooked meat. My wings weren't exactly saucy or crispy enough, but I ordered boneless wings and sometimes that can be a problem with those. I have to say that for an appetizer size, they sure gave a lot of food. Blake was excellent so we will be back to have him take care of us again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-corona?start=40,3.24,2.81,2.81,3.372,2.982

We sat at the bar, and was immediately helped by the bartender. I had ordered a type of BBQ burger and it was beautifully prepared and presented, paired with a Lagunitas IPA and I was set.  The only issue I have was that when using the rewards program, if you have a promotional item (for instance, a BOGO) there is no warning or heads up from the server. Though this might not be an issue for some, it was for me as my lady and I knew a family member with one and decided to have my meal count towards her account as we don't come here often. Looked at our check after we signed and completed the transaction to see the burger came off (meaning, instead of helping the family member, I took their reward from them).

The food my wife's wrap was fine.  But our french fries were raw and only luke warm.  I went with a simple burger wanting quality over quantity.  What I got tasted like anything but beef.  The quality was so bad I could not finish it. The wifes happy hour drink was s watered down she could not finish that.  It was good they had machines to pay at or we might still be waiting. The one star is for my wifes wrap.  We have been there before and expected better.  Yes we have been there before but in my world you dont get 3 strikes your out.

It was around 7:30pm and the restaurant was super slow. It was my husband and 3 kids. We ordered our drinks: Husband asked for a ice tea. Waiter never offered any kind of sweetener and by the time he walked by, my husband was in a bad mood to ask him for any. I ordered a lemon drop martini. It tasted more like lemonade and the rim of the glass didn't have any sugar like a real martini is suppose to.  The food came and it wasn't any better. My husband ordered a bar-b-q burger. It was missing the bar-b-q sauce. My chicken wrap looked more like a street taco than a wrap. My daughters fruit looked like it was soaked in water and our fries were hard and staled. Just gross.  Last but not least and the icing on the cake, there was a huge cockroach walking in the kitchen. We got sat in the back right by managers office and we had a view of the whole kitchen. As soon as we got sat down, I got an iffy feeling about this restaurant. Worse part is an employee was pointing it out to the female manager and she ignored her. It wasn't until I told her; you have a cockroach walking in your kitchen did she go back, but all she did was look at it. It wasn't until we also pointed out to our waiter and that's when he went over there and stepped on it. To be clear it was a water bug cockroach so when then waiter was trying to step on it, it started flying trying to get away. SO GROSS!!!

1,Autumn L.,"Riverside, CA",204,116,161.0,3.0,2017-11-10,"We were ushered into the bar area; which is fine because there were no children in our party. We ordered food, it came out in a semi reasonable amount of time.  Their drinks are ok; I ordered a lemon drop martini it was a bit on the sweet side and I believe lemonade was used instead of lemon juice & powdered sugar. Lemonade is super sweet for me. I'm more on a tart kick than sweet.  Our food was correct and tasted fair. We will return to this location",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-corona,2.04,3.14,3.14,,2.7

11,Varinia R.,"Riverside, CA",63,40,53.0,2.0,2017-11-19,"I received an email from Red Robin if you ordered carry out, you would get 35% off your order. Of course I jumped on that deal. I went to the restaurant at the time they said my order would be ready. Tgere was a lady in front of me also waiting at the bar for her carry out. I want to say she had to wait like 10 minutes and she finally got her food. But they forgot her drinks, so then that took another couple minutes. It looked like they were really busy and weren't prepared for all the carryout orders. They brought out some food afterwards and left it on the counter. I wasnt sure if it was mine since more people came in and were waiting for their carryout as well. I waited for like 15 minutes and had to get a waitress' attention to ask if that order was mine and turns out it was mine. At no time did  anyone ever acknowledged me to say sorry for the wait. They also forgot about my drinks and I had to try to get someone's attention so I could get them. You would think I would of received something extra for the inconvenience or at least an apology....but nothing. When I got home, the burgers weren't hot and they forgot the jalapenos I paid extra for on my husband's cheeseburger.  I called and spoke to a manager and she apologized and said they weren't prepared for all the orders and offered to send a giftcard for the amount I spent. That was nice, but wished I had a better experience at this place and wished the staff there was more attentive to the customer. I haven't returned to this location because of that, but I have gone to the Riverside location and received excellent foid & customer service there. So I now go that location only.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-corona,2.36,3.17,3.17,,2.8459999999999996
3,Mrs. B.,"Riverside, CA",21,116,86.0,5.0,2017-12-07,I am highly impressed! I haven't been to RR in over 10 years because of the poor customer service. I decided to give it another shot and my goodness it was AMAZING!!!!!!!! The food was fresh the service was great. My waitress was Andrea and she was such a sweetheart very attentive and so sweet.

I love the customer service that she attended me with I will be coming back again as long as Andrea is my waitress always making sure if my food was okay and checking on my drinks.

4,Laura L.,"Ontario, CA",71,94,17.0,5.0,2017-12-27,Our family of four were seated very quickly and served by Hunter. She took our drink orders promptly and we ordered very quickly. Our family was super hangry and we were very surprised when our food came out in less than 10 minutes of ordering. Food and service were amazing and we are glad we stopped in. We were planning to go to the one at the mall (parking was horrendous) but it was worth the extra few minutes of driving to come to this location for the great service!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-corona,2.8,3.25,3.25,,3.07
