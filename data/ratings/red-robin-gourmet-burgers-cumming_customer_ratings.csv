90,Tyler B.,"Flowery Branch, GA",23,8,,5.0,2012-01-27,"Went tonight with my girlfriend to get a bite to eat. Just an appetizer and a dessert. We got the ""Mountain High Mudd Pie"", which is a HUGE amount of ice cream, at least five scoops worth, to my estimation. Not to mention the whipped cream and tasty caramel. Easily worth the $7 Our appetizer, which was also $7, was the ""Cheeseburger Con Queso"", a "" zesty cheese dip with fresh ground beef, topped with salsa and fresh cilantro"". It was VERY disappointing. The dip was bland, and the chips a bit stale. I've had much better queso at other restaurants for half the price. Now, you may be saying ""if the queso is so bad, why are you giving them a five-star review?"" Well, I let our waiter know about the quality of the queso, and the manager came out, apologized, and took it off our check! If that's not great service, I don't know what is. I've enjoyed the food at RR for a while and will continue to do so!

Out of seven of us, five of us had chicken plates. The other two had burgers. We ate, we drank, we paid, we left. The next day, all five of us that had the chicken plates all had food poisoning. Mine was the worst. Stomach pains persisted for 6 days for me while the other four were just a few days. The worst part is that we had to catch our flight back to Ca with food poisoning. It was the longest flight ever!!! We called the restaurant to complain. The person who answered asked if we were part of the business group that got sick. HUH??? You mean there were others???? We called corporate RR. They were apologetic and reversed the charges. However, they were negligent in providing any concrete information in HOW they were going to rectify what happened. They said they were in touch with the Dept of Health (suuure!!!!). I will be complaining with the DOH as well. I will NEVER eat at an RR.

56,Richard R.,"Suwanee, GA",2315,1000,11015.0,3.0,2012-04-15,"Red Robin is probably thee most attractive burger joint anywhere. The decor is outstanding, but I wish the taste of the food matched.  When they first came to town and open their doors off Web Gin House Rd in Snellville, it was amazing. It marked the first time I'd ever had a burger with a fried egg on top. I fell DEEP in love when they introduced endless steak cut garlic fries... but after a little time went by, it seems the food became less and less satisfying.  Got a coupon on Facebook ($5 off) and thought I'd give them a try. After all, it's been a few years. To my delight they had Patty Melts on the menu, but to my disappointment it was not as flavorful as I hoped.  *The Patty Melt was average. If I had a wish list it would be for a better seasoned burger patty, rye bread that tastes like rye (which this bread did not) and fries that aren't visibly dripping with grease. I also prefer grated Parmesan cheese on the fries instead of stringy shaved (like I received today).  *The Clam Chowder was good, but I used to think it was great (back when they first opened). *The fried mushrooms were ok, I would have liked them cooked a tad bit longer, but not bad.  Overall, I love the look of this place, but don't have the same love for the food. It's not a bad restaurant, but for the price of food here, I can think of several places I'd rather go. NOTE to guys who love redheads w/green eyes: They have a girl working here that looks exactly like Emma Stone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cumming?start=40,2.76,2.76,2.76,2.9240000000000004,2.76

83,Laura T.,"Atlanta, GA",1,184,26.0,4.0,2012-07-16,"I have always enjoyed eating at RR. I've been to one in CA, one in OH, one in FL & 2 of the locations here in GA. This last trip (to this location) was the best one yet as far as service. We had an awesome waitress! I will def make sure to ask for her when we next visit for my hubby's b'day. I will say that we started with the sweet potato fries & they left a good bit to be desired. We actually had a free voucher for them.  I wouldn't pay for them, based on how they tasted. They were room-temp at best, not too tasty & came with an odd dipping sauce. Our burgers were good as always. I think the steak fries seemed a bit less yummy than they used to be. Not quite as hot, not seasoned at all (they do provide seasoning salt on the table, tho), and didn't seem quite as fresh & soft as they used to.  I sure hope the quality of RR isn't going downhill (based on reviews I've read of this location & the Lawrenceville one).  Boo-hiss if so!  They've always been one of my favorite burger places since I discovered them about 8 years ago. But based on the service we got this time, I know we'll be back.  And I always love, love the Whiskey River BBQ burger.   But if anyone at RR is actually reading these reviews, please don't go down in quality like some other chains I know & used to like much better (hello Zaxby's anyone?)......",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cumming?start=80,2.92,2.92,2.92,2.9920000000000004,2.92

The Sam Adams shake is outstanding. Try it. Thank me later. you won't be let down. Also, the Sam Adams burger was really good. The Oktoberfest flavor fills both of these items and really gives you that great flavor you are looking for.  As for the rest of the restaurant, we honestly didn't pay attention.

63,Brent H.,"Midlothian, VA",124,163,75.0,4.0,2013-02-27,"My first time visiting Red Robin in Cumming was a couple of weeks ago.  I don't think I'd ever stepped foot in a Red Robin before but I could be wrong about that, because I tend to confuse this chain with Johnny Rockets. It was Valentine's Day and we had tickets for Die Hard.  Rather than fight other miserable couples for service at a ""nice"" restaurant before the movie, we opted for this place because we figured that a greasy burger joint is not exactly a romantic destination.  We were correct.  However, it does appear to be an after school destination for Forsyth's preteen population. The interior is surprisingly spacious and clean.  There is kitschy stuff strewn about like road signs, odd art and a miniature Statue of Liberty that greets you at the door.  There is also a small arcade area with video games adjacent to the entrance, and more importantly, a full bar.  I wasn't aware that they served alcohol at these places but they'll whip up a boozy shake for you if that's what your heart desires. Our server was very attentive.  That's important because they served my Diet Coke in the smallest possible glass which was also crammed full of ice.  Just a few sips from that thing and it was drained.  But the server was so on her game that I never went thirsty, even though that meant bringing at least four refills.  She never complained or rolled her eyes once. I ordered a cheeseburger with a fried egg on it, because that is the best way to order a burger.  Instead of asking how I wanted the meat cooked, she asked me if I wanted ""pink or no pink"".  This concerned me a bit but I understand the need to standardize the cooking process at these fast-casual chains.  Fortunately my ""pink"" burger was delivered to the table at a perfect medium.  My preference is medium-rare, but it was honestly very well cooked and flavorful so I can't complain too much.  The egg was also fried to perfection.  It was a damn tasty burger and much better than I had anticipated. Burgers at Red Robin come with bottomless fries.  You can keep ordering fries until your gut bursts.  That's a nice option, but these aren't fries that would make me want to order multiple baskets.  They are massive steak fries covered with a lip-puckering coating of salt.  You can opt for sweet potato fries at a $1.50 upcharge, but frankly they are just as salty and not worth the cost in my opinion.  Stick to the regular fries and limit yourself to one portion for the best experience. Red Robin pleasantly surprised me.  Well cooked burgers, fast and friendly service, and reasonable prices.  Plus booze.  That's a winning combination.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cumming?start=60,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.768,3.0000000000000004

My husband is a repeat customer, but when I questioned price vs product vs what he typically gets at home, he suddenly lost his appetite and said that he would not be returning to the Robin.   Know BEFORE you go.

36,Jay W.,"Cumming, GA",0,21,,1.0,2015-05-22,"I grew up on the west coast, so Red Robin was pretty much part of my life growing up. I have a lot of fond memories there with family and friends across Alaska, Washington and Oregon.  Not surprisingly, I was pretty excited when the Red Robin showed up in Georgia right near our home. One of the only ones here.  Unfortunately, this Red Robin is like seeing your first love from high school after 15 years and they've gotten fat, lost their teeth, and generally lost any semblance of what you loved about them in the first place.  Having been here several times*, my experience has been exactly the same: The service is generally slow and inattentive, the food much below what you would/should expect, and the entire meal is just plain not good.  It's like the corporate HQ forgot they had a restaurant here and so there is little accountability or even desire for the local management to more than the min to get by. It makes me sad to write this review but I have no other choice. Hopefully someone reads this and steps up their game. I hope so, because my family would love to come back. But it's highly doubtful.  *ive been several times for the same reason I've been several times to McDonald's: Because I want it to be good and forget how bad it is until I eat them meal, and realize what a terrible mistake I've made.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cumming?start=20,2.88,2.88,2.88,2.372,2.88

Maybe 20 minutes ago, yes. But now we wanted to leave. I asked for a check, and she told me I had to pay using the wireless tablet at our table.

Only the chicken fingers came out right. Without sauce, but right.  I am not sure why waiters love trying to remember things, but writing things down does not make you any less of a waiter. In fact, in my book, it only makes you better. I appreciate you taking the time to make sure what you bring me is what I ordered. Repeat it back to me to verify? Even better! But once you get past our server, the food was not worth the money. I try to separate the service and food since one can just be a bad egg, but not in this case. The kids burger was gross, the other food was just ok. The milkshakes were good but not the best. I'd prob choose chickfila over RR, but I am a chickfila addict so that may just be me.

35,Jennie F.,"Cumming, GA",3,42,1.0,1.0,2017-08-09,"Tried Red Robin again and had an equally disappointing experience. When the waitress seated us with a smile, she asked what I wanted to drink. When I asked for water instead of an alcoholic beverage, I guess our party of two instantly became unappealing to her. From that moment on, her attitude changed, barely giving us the time of day and even trying to rush us. In the middle of placing our order, the waitress stopped me and walked off to have a laugh with another server that was throwing things at her from behind. Later, when she dropped off our meals, she walked off before I could look anything over or asking if we needed anything else--literally dropped the plates and ran. I paged the waitress using the electronic device on the table, but she never returned or acknowledged us until it was time for the bill--I had to ask another passing waiter for the item missing from our meal. My son ordered freckled fruit salad--not a single strawberry in it. Bottomless fries? Nope, not today. My son also wanted a shake to go, so I placed the order through the electronic device at the table. The waitress returned, instructing me to go ahead and pay through the device, once again not asking if we needed anything else or even if we were satisfied. I asked about the shake we ordered and she looked stunned and ran off to get it, quickly returning to try to hurry us from her table again. Unreal experience. On top of this, the table was sticky and the overall cleanliness of restaurant was just plain nasty. When a nine-year-old boy makes a statement that ""McDonalds is cleaner than that place,"" you got a BIG problem. The food was OK, definitely not worth the hype nor the price.

1,Karen N.,"Atlanta, GA",3,22,50.0,2.0,2017-09-06,"I used to regularly frequent this restaurant because I love the burgers and the concept of bottomless sides. But the last two visits have been thoroughly disappointing. At one of my visits my broccoli side had some sort of white web inside. I should have taken a picture of it at the time, but I was too alarmed. I called the waitress over, and she took it to the manager. He came over and told me that the broccoli was SUPPOSED to have black ends and that he didn't see any bug or white web. I eat a lot of vegetables (I know you're thinking who in the world would order bottomless broccoli), and I previously would order the broccoli here and I am sure it is not supposed to turn black or have a white-webbed creature in its midst. They gave me a coupon for a free appetizer for my next visit. I waited a few months before coming again because it was hard to get over the image of the browning broccoli and cocooned critter. I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt and maybe they just ran out of fresh broccoli that day. Their burgers are normally pretty fabulous, so I wanted to try them again. I ordered the pretzel bites (with the free coupon), and they were not anything special. The cheese dip it came with was unimpressive. I ordered the Banzai (one of my favorites) with the onion roll bun. The flavoring in the burger itself was wonderful as always, but the bun wasn't cooked long enough so I was disappointed. And of course I made the tragic mistake of ordering bottomless broccoli again. It was browning at the tops and ends again (although thankfully I did not discover any white webs). I told the waitress the broccoli was old and asked for fries instead. I have resigned to the fact that they will disappoint. For such a well-known franchise, I think they should take better care to uphold a better quality of food so as not to embarrass the rest of the chain. If you're looking to eat some tasty burgers and binge on steak fries then this may still be a good restaurant for you. But if you are interested in being certain this is a clean restaurant with fresh produce then you may want to reconsider.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-cumming,3.2,3.07,3.07,,3.122
