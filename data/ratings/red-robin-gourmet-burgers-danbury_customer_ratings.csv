We were seated in the bar section. When all the tables are full with customers it's just a little tight to walk around. Cookie Magic Milkshake was good. Ordered the Ensenada Chicken Platter. The chicken was cooked great, juicy with lots of flavor. The servers were very attentive and quick with any requests. They also were very knowledgeable and answered all questions about the menu. Great first experience and I will be returning to check out their Happy Hour.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-danbury?start=60,2.644,2.644,2.644,2.644,2.644

88,Indira P.,"Danbury, CT",0,35,5.0,5.0,2013-12-02,"The 5 start are for service and atmosphere not the food since we did not get to eat it. I'll explain. Sunday Dec 1 was my 2nd visit to Red Robin and my BF's 3rd. It was not packed so we sat at one of the high tops at the bar and were served relatively quickly by Susie (very nice) so we ordered our pints (ice cold) and the Honest Hummus with carrots, cucumbers and potatoes kettle chips app.  The app came out with bone dry and ashy carrots and soggy chips; there always seems to be a lot of floor managers just roaming so I called one over and Gary was kind enough to remove the app and request a rush on a new order (no problem).  Approximately 18mins later Gary the manager is told by the kitchen manager that they are out of hummus, NOT GOOD. Gary apologized profusely and we placed our dinner order of burgers and fries.  OK! The burgers came out and my sweet fries were cold, my burger was cold and not at all how I ordered it and my BF's crispy chicken was also not how he ordered it and his fries were raw.   Again, we called Gary over and again he was very apologetic.  We told him we understood how things can happen but that we would not be ordering food at that time. He was very nice and actually pleasant just as our server Susie was.  He was not at all happy with the food prep and even gave us our pints at no charge for the ridiculousness and weird inconvenience.

I was with a group of 5 - 4 adults and 1 child. 3 of the 4 adults (excluding myself of course) had many questions and needy creations with their meals. Our waitress was very helpful with helping our picky eaters pick out a good burger.  I had the Whiskey River BBQ Burger - it was scrumptious.

I had to ask for napkins..my husband glass sat their empty during his meal until he called her over again.  Needless to say, my coke was empty 1/2 way thru the meal and never refilled.

83,Bob D.,"Bethel, CT",0,5,,2.0,2014-03-02,"Stopped in for a mid afternoon Sunday lunch, wait was about fifteen minutes and we were seated in that time frame. The place was kind of busy and our waitress was at the table right away to take a drink and food order. Our soda's arrived quickly but it took quite a while for our food to arrive, which is strange given that it really is only a burger joint, nothing fancy on the menu just burgers and sandwich type stuff. I know it's not McDonalds fast, fast food, but things should have moved along a lot quicker, they need to really work on this. The food was ok as burgers go, nothing special just middle of the road. The fries were tasteless, maybe a hint of freezer burn and the onion rings dripped oil, lots of oil. For the two of us with no apps, soda and two burgers it was forty bucks with tip. I'd put that on the pricey side for burgers. Will I go back, probably not, I can eat the same at five guys for half the money and quarter the time. Seems like the place is more about the show and less about the go.

He also walked by a busser who clearly needed help after dropping silverware with his hands full. The floor at the main entrance was buckled due to a flood in the dish room. There was no warning sign, it was only covered by a mat. If someone were to trip the manager would be screwed with a lawsuit. I would never go back nor recommend anyone to go.

96,Brody B.,"Ridgefield, CT",1,35,1.0,1.0,2014-06-20,"2 stars would be extremely generous but other than the friendly hostess and a decent atmosphere, our dining experience was pretty bad. As stated by many others, don't expect for your food to come out without a loooong wait! Even with the place being at less than half capacity! I wouldn't mind waiting a bit for good food but the food (when It finally arrived) was beyond awful! I had the French dip sandwich. It was the worst I have EVER had!!! It was tiny, there was barely any meat and the meat that was in there was so dry, cold, and tasteless that if it wasn't for the au jus dipping sauce, I would not have taken a second bite! The edges of the meat sticking out beyond the ""mini"" French roll were rock solid and the horseradish sauce was so dried into the bread underneath that it was showing cracks! The menu advertised it being served with caramelized onions, I think there were a few in there somewhere. Then there were the sides... I'd comment on the taste of the coleslaw but the dollop was so minuscule that I didn't have enough for that third deciding bite. The only thing that was pretty good were the sweet potato fries despite a few of them being soggy. Then I hear a server announce to the table behind us that they're out of onion rings. Really? At 1pm on a Sunday? Shame on the people that run this place!!! If I wasn't trying to show a good example to my kids, I'd have called over the manager which I never do! It was that bad! I hope the manager or some corporate exec that gives a crap about this place is reading this and all the other reviews and makes a change. I'm rooting for this place to succeed and don't remember having such an awful dining experience in other Red Robin location. Get your act together and fast!

95,Jennine L.,"Danbury, CT",2,17,1.0,1.0,2014-10-24,"Went there for lunch, wait time was minimal. Food was average. My waiter was attentive to our needs and very friendly. He stated we were his first customers of the day. An hour later he asked if we were all done, because he needed to punch out. Apparently, when the wait staff have no customers in their section they are required to punch out! He left his previous job because red robin promised full time work. Well it's not full time if your staff have to punch out during their shift. I'm not a waitress, nor have I ever been, but I think this is a terrible way to treat employees. This company will never be able to hold on to good waiters/ waitresses because of this policy.

The side dish, French onion soup was less than adequate. It had a soggy unappetizing piece of bread under the cheese and very little actual onion. They should call it onion broth. On top of that it was served with a teaspoon instead of a soup spoon so it took a long time to even get through half. My burger arrived while I wasn't even halfway done.  My dates salad could only be called that in the abstract sense. A very large chunk of iceberg lettuce on a plate with some bacon and fried onions on top isn't much of a salad. Guess he was supposed to slice and toss it himself.   Our server was very friendly, but a tad distracted. This was both of ours first visit to a Red Robin.

It turned out to be 3 minutes.  We waited about 15 minutes for someone to take our order. Once we had the initial meeting with our waitress she was excellent and absolutely went the extra mile.They gave my pregnant wife a free order of onion rings to apologize for the wait.

It was nice to not have to wait, and it was relatively quiet other than one unhappy infant on the other side of the wall.  At this point, we pretty much have standing orders... I like the Southern Charm burger - no bun, and the husband likes the Royal Red Robin burger with a lettuce wrapper. My favorite includes cheddar, brown sugar bacon, lettuce, tomato and a sweet barbecue sauce. His comes with a fried egg, bacon, american cheese, lettuce and tomato. We each choose to indulge in the onion rings rather than the bottomless fries - they are well worth it! Crispy, panko crusted golden rings of yumminess! It's a must to forgo the traditional ketchup and ask for a side of the Campfire Sauce to dip them in. We have yet to be disappointed in the food here. We typically opt for unsweetened iced tea, but tonight I tried one of their new summer drinks - the Strawberry Lemon Vojito - Strawberry Lemon Vojito - billed as ""Mojito's long-lost cousin. Made with Absolut Citron® vodka, Minute Maid® Lemonade, mint, strawberries and club soda."" It was refreshing, not too sweet, and I'd definitely get it again!  Our servers have always been polite and attentive, without being overwhelming. This place is not around the corner for us, and we choose to take the ride when the burger (and onion ring!!) craving strikes.

So we waited on hour just for broccoli. If they had good service, it would have came at the first of second time. But the third, not good. And we ordered salad and they were all out at like 8:00.

I rarely complain about poor dining experiences.  However, I feel compelled to complain about a recent dining experience at the Red Robin restaurant located at the Danbury, CT mall. My family has eaten at two dozen or so different Red Robin restaurants over the past ten years. We have always been quite satisfied with the quality of the food and the quality of the service at these Red Robin restaurants......until eating at the Danbury Mall Red Robin restaurant! Food wait time and restaurant cleanliness was very poor.  Three other families had problems with their food orders and wait time as did we.  Based on the many negative reviews of this restaurant over the past 1-2 years, it is clearly obvious this Red Robin restaurant has SERIOUS management problems that need to be immediately corrected by Corporate Red Robin. This poorly managed Red Robin restaurant is giving all of the many other well managed Red Robin restaurants a ""big black eye"". Red Robin must be losing a ton of future repeat business from the many disgruntled dining customers who have dined at this Red Robin restaurant over the past year or so.  This also has to be giving the Red Robin Corporation some serious bad press.  I will not re-visit this restaurant nor can I presently recommend this restaurant to friends/family that live in the Danbury, CT area.  I provided my disappointing dining experience feedback to the Red Robin Danbury mall restaurant before leaving the restaurant. I am sure my feedback was completely ignored by the restaurant manager as evidenced the MANY negative reviews by other customers who visited this same restaurant following my 9/30/15 restaurant visit.  I see the same problems continue!  I also sent an email to Corporate Red Robin informing them about my family's poor dining experience at this restaurant.  I suggest everyone who takes the time to write and post a negative review about this restaurant on YELP also take a few additional minutes send a copy of their same negative review to Corporate Red Robin.  Go to the Red Robin website, click ""Guest Support"", and Click ""Restaurant Feedback"".  Copy and paste your negative review here.  Mention the fact you have also posted your negative review on the the national YELP website. Maybe Corporate Red Robin will take some serious, corrective action if more people directly complain to Corporate Red Robin about this poorly managed corporate owned or franchised owned restaurant.

21,V P.,"Manhattan, NY",2,45,,1.0,2017-02-06,"I've given this place at least 10 chances. And it was 10 chances too many. It's consistently the same bad service since the day it opened.  Long story short, if you are planning on ordering over the phone FORGET IT! These people are never interested in having your business! You WILL be kept on hold for a minimum os 5-15minutes. (EVERY single time!) This is because they have this genius system where they want to get someone from the bar to take your take out order. Great system! As you know bartenders are really motivated to do something they probably aren't gonna get a tip for! So you'll wait for NO reason and it seems almost as if that they are doing it passively aggressively, out of spite.  So why am I officially done with this Danbury location? Girl comes on says ""1hr. wait for orders."" Wait....WHAT??? 1HR WAIT? I asked why. ""We're really busy today!"" Since when is that kind of wait time acceptable? It's as if she was saying that to make it sure I WOULDN'T order. Which I proceeded to do. That's a great way to send your customers elsewhere. Yes, I understand that it was a weekend day at lunchtime; but this was 3pm! Well AFTER lunchtime. 1HR wait at 3PM?? Unheard of!  You know, nobody can be having THAT much business and act like they don't need it! When I walk by on weekdays, that place is empty and dead as a doornail. So I hope the employees realize that in case if they find themselves out of a job because the place shut down, don't ask why! I won't feel sorry for them WHEN that happens (It really is just a question of ""when"". None of these restaurants survive at DFM.)  Here is the sad part: The quality of the food is actually outstanding! All credit goes to the kitchen at this place. But the service staff have to be kicked out! I have seen so many of the service staff behave in a similar manner. So this is not directed at any one person, it is consistent. It's safe to assume this is ""the norm"" around here and this behavior is allowed. And even acceptable! It is a clear indication that management is very very poor at this place.  This is not to say that the Red Robin experience is normally this way at all. I frequented a location in NJ for years. And been to other locations across the country. It's been a 5-star experience every single time. But this place? 1 star every time. And it shouldn't be this way because this place could truly dominate Danbury if it wanted to. Ask around and you will realize that there are many people that don't even realize this place exists!  Orders shouldn't be taken by the bar people anymore. OK fine, I understand that they rely on tips. Orders should be taken by the greeter or someone not being tipped do it. That's how it's usually done. That way they'll do it without expecting incentive or grumbling about it!  Corporate, you listening? See problems in the numbers? THIS is why!

It wasn't packed, but steady with many open tables. It took awhile to get seated because the host was MIA. We were finally seated and then greeted by our waiter. We ordered onion rings to start which are always a favorite. They ran out of the Campfire sauce and said the kitchen was making more. Not a big deal but it does speak to the efficiency, or lack there of, in regards to the kitchens organization-a sign of what was to come. We received our food and to say I was disappointed is an understatement. I ordered the Whiskey BBQ burger and I've never seen a sadder display. The toppings were limp and less than fresh. My fries weren't cold, but they weren't hot either. Just meh. Now we come to the real issue and absolute ridiculousness of this restaurant. My sister ordered sweet potato fries with her order and they were ice cold. So, we naturally did what any normal consumer would do. We asked for new fries. Guess what they brought us? A basket of the same exact cold fries. The best part was that the waiter said, ""Yeah, so I guess the sweet potato fries are coming out lukewarm today.""  What?! I mean seriously, as a waiter I would have gone Gordon Ramsay on the cook and said ""These fries are so cold, a goose down parka couldn't warm them up!""  What reason could the kitchen have for not making new fries? Is it really rocket science to lower the basket in the fryer and make your customers happy? From start to end this visit was terrible. Makes me question my entire love for Red Robin.

3,Brian B.,"Beacon, NY",8,35,6.0,1.0,2017-08-22,"I hate to give it a 1 star review because the burgers are actually tasty but that's how bad the staff is here.  Our waitress was rude, incompetent, and downright stupid.  That's right Isabelle, I'm talking to you.  Sat down for a quick burger with my father and sister and explained we were going to take one to go for my girlfriend waiting at home.  Not wanting to wait around for it we tried to place the order to go when we were ordering our own food but she just wouldn't take it.  Another waitress brings out our food, minus my chipotle aioli of course, and still no sign of Isabelle.  We are basically finished with our meal and calling her on the tech device at the table before she saunters over to tell us she'd forgotten about taking the to go order.  Another 20 minutes of waiting and we were finally on our way.  Please, spare yourself the aggravation and do not go here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-danbury,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
1,Briana M.,"Manhattan, NY",7,50,63.0,1.0,2017-10-04,"I wish I had read the reviews before coming here in order to have spared myself. This has to have been the worst service I have ever received in my life.. not only was it slow, our waitress was also absent and rude. My party of 4 tried to write it off as ""they do things slower in Connecticut"" and we were just being fast paced New Yorkers - but when we received our cold food we almost lost it.  We all got a deal with our burgers for bottomless fries so we stayed just for them. They didn't necessarily fix our experience but it did help.  45 minutes is way too long of a wait for ""FAST"" food - GET IT TOGETHER RED ROBIN.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-danbury,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
9,Cathleen M.,"Wappingers Falls, NY",0,17,,1.0,2017-10-07,"Would give ""zero"" stars but can't.  Have been coming here regularly and last night was by far the worst so much so that I will NEVER be back. We were asked if we wouldn't mind being seated in the lounge and when we got there we waited 10 min to be acknowledged, then another 45 min waiting for our food to which we watched the waitress talk to friends of hers and wondered if our food was sitting in the back getting cold.  She finally acknowledged us and checked on our food.  Watching her come from the kitchen she stopped again to talk to someone and someone else's  drink she was also carrying fell over on the tray and broke.  We watched her go to the bar and then comes over and says "" I think there is glass in your salad, not sure about the hamburger"". Umm were we to test it out??  She then says she would have to look through the salad.  Huh, now you will search the salad to see if there is glass.  We said ""absolutely not"" to which she ran to the back......saying nothing.  We walked up to the bar and said  ""goodbye"". To which we received no apology ... nothing !  he just just ran over to computer to cancel our order.  Unbelievable!!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-danbury,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
2,Kathy D.,"Bethel, CT",38,16,8.0,3.0,2017-10-09,"Not my first or second choice to eat, but we were at the mall and my boys wanted burgers. The hostess sat us in the middle, because there was no other spot, even though there was lots of room in the back. Waitress was ok. But wanted us to order our app on the computer screen. Isn't that her job?  Food a little slow coming out. My chicken meal, looked nothing like the picture. It had so much blackening spice it was in eatable. Plus I asked for 1 piece of chicken not 2. But the kitchen manager saw me looking at the menu and asked me what was wrong and I told him. He offered to recook some new chicken and brought it out to me. Told me it came with 2 pieces even though menu showed option for 1. He really cared about his service and was walking around a quite bit. He also gave me his business card and coupon for free appetizer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-danbury,2.4,2.27,2.27,,2.322
19,Stryker H.,"Danbury, CT",0,11,1.0,1.0,2017-10-10,"I thought back over as many bad restaurant experiences as I could remember, but I could not think of one bad experience that was even close to the level of Red Robin. It took 35 Minutes to get our drinks. At that point we asked if we could have our soup while we waited for the burgers. We were told they had to 'bake' the soup. Really? At 45 mins into the Red Robin nightmare, we told the waitress to cancel our order and bring us a check for our soft drinks. At 55 mins a man, presumably the manager, told us they were working on our order. Two cups of soup, and two burgers. He repeatedly tried to get us to stay, and eventually cancelled the bill for our two sodas. According to some of the serving staff, they also have to do the dishes on some days, and that explained why we had such a bad experience. That seems difficult to believe, but, who knows?  There were not a lot of diners in the restaurant. Perhaps this is not the norm there? If it was they would have long since closed the doors. This was so bad, I wouldn't even consider ever giving it another try. This is as our first time there, so we'll never know if the burgers were good. The soda was fine though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-danbury,2.24,2.23,2.23,,2.2340000000000004
10,Kristin C.,"Beacon Falls, CT",0,2,19.0,1.0,2017-10-29,"Stopped in to grab a quick salad. Our waitress was very nice, but the venue clearly has no sense of urgency. Dirty tables everywhere.

4,Sara G.,"Wolcott, CT",26,9,6.0,1.0,2017-11-26,"I went to Red Robin with my boyfriend I was really hungry and we chose to go to Red Robin because I thought it would be filling. I ordered the Siracha Burger when I got the burger it was literally just hamburger, cheese, and a tiny bit of onion on a bun ..no siracha no spicy mayo no pickles no lettuce no tomatoes which were all supposed to be in the burger as it says in the menu. If they somehow were missing all those ingredients which is kind of hard to believe the waitress could have a least let me know instead of giving me a bland burger with basically nothing on it. I asked to at least have some siracha sauce to put in it since it's supposed to be a siracha burger and the waitress handed me a little container of powder ..I was like seriously... anyways even being extremely hungry I was able to force myself to eat half the burger but felt sick and grossed out to eat any more then that. Nevertheless the waitresses at Red Robin need to be trained to how to properly communicate with customers and at least try to be accommodating. I left still very hungry and very displeased will not be going back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-danbury,2.2,2.19,2.19,,2.1940000000000004
0,Emily B.,"Fairfield, CT",15,388,150.0,3.0,2017-12-08,"I'm perplexed about the negative reviews for this location and I'm thinking I must have went to a different restaurant. Now, this place isn't gourmet dining, but you can go in and get a good deal for a decent price. I came in for lunch and ordered the Madlove burger, suggested by my server, Laura. While the food took a little extra time to come out. The food runner, immediately upon brining our my meal, asked about me needing anything else and quickly brought it out to me. My burger, with some pink, was perfectly cooked. The garlic fries were good, but I have had better. For the price, I feel like I had a good quality meal. However, as someone who loves sauce, I was disappointed that they charge per premium sauce. At the very least, the first one should be included. Don't nickel and dime honest customers, please! Overall, I had positive thoughts to share about this RR with others and next time I'm craving a burger, I'd come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-danbury,2.28,2.18,2.18,,2.22
