23,Melinda G.,"Lake St Louis, MO",32,79,71.0,4.0,2012-04-17,Service from Derek was excellent! Food was out super fast! Their iced tea taste like instant though...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dardenne-prairie,,,,,
22,Mark H.,"Dardenne Prairie, MO",8,377,3.0,3.0,2012-08-11,Things have changed for the better at this location.  Must have been a change in management.  I swore I would never go back into this location but we were in the area and I was craving a burger so we gave it another shot.  Glad we did.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dardenne-prairie,,,,,
2,karyn p.,"St Charles, MO",0,14,,2.0,2012-12-05,"I know...it's a chain, and what should I expect.  Their food is always just good enough not to complain (although my 6 year old really seems to dig their pizza).  I got a wrap and fries, which are supposed to be ""bottomless"", but was never brought more throughout the meal.  I also ordered a side salad, which cost $1.99 on the menu.  When I got the bill, this salad was almost $5. Yeah, I could have complained, but what good does that do?  Also, our drinks sat empty for much too long.  I'll go back to make my son happy, but he's going to have to do something special to get me back in the doors.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dardenne-prairie?start=20,,,,,
13,Scott S.,"Dardenne Prairie, MO",5,9,31.0,5.0,2013-08-14,"Excellent service.  Family friendly.  Free refills on most drinks including Rootbeer Floats (yummy) and Strawberry Lemonades.  I enjoy the Prime Chophouse Burger.  I also  will usually get their incredible Onion Rings rather than fries, with my burger.  There is an up-charge and it isn't bottomless like the fries.  But the portion size is right and I don't pay extra for the Towering Ring Appetizer. Great place for birthday parties.  Make sure to get Red Robins Rewards card for free meals.   They will also get you drinks to go as well.  Overall, great family value restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dardenne-prairie,,,,,
0,C M.,"O'Fallon, MO",2,97,,3.0,2013-10-19,Good place for quick hamburger and yummy fries. My biggest dislike is feeling like I'm eating in a school cafeteria.  It's definitely a family place and for some reason the noise level is just too much. If I'm going it's at an odd time during day so I can eat and have a conversation without shouting. Staff friendly.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dardenne-prairie?start=20,,,,,
1,Kayla T.,"O'Fallon, MO",0,5,,5.0,2014-05-12,I come here a lot. Each and every time I've had good service. The food was always good and the service was quick. It's usually busy but they rarely make you wait long for your table.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dardenne-prairie?start=20,,,,,
20,Candice S.,"Wentzville, MO",10,40,35.0,3.0,2014-06-15,"Food is always good, the atmosphere is very loud. Service is usually slow to horribly slow. We waited our whole meal for more napkins. Usually do not have to wait to be seated but wait staff is slow.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dardenne-prairie,,,,,
19,Jimmie O.,"Saint Louis, MO",1,45,75.0,3.0,2014-10-31,"What can you say about red robin that hasn't already been said? Good food, kid friendly, and predictable. So that leaves us focused on this lake at louis location. Food is on par with everything you've come to love, but the short star review is centered around service. The staff was extremely friendly!, but as friendly as they were the inefficiency trumped. A little training could go a very long way. Empty glasses, dirty dishes, and the dreaded ""where's my check"". These servers walked their feet off. Kitchen to one table......back to kitchen one more table.....back to kitchen and do on....... Someone please tell these sweet girls it's ok to talk to more than one table and save some trips. Manager was running food, but he walked by table after table of empty glasses and dirty dishes ????? The restaurant was fairly empty for this type of endurance race. Send in some trainers and get those other stars. We do like Red Robin and know what this place should be.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dardenne-prairie,,,,,
10,Cynthia K.,"O'Fallon, Saint Louis, MO",24,115,100.0,5.0,2015-10-18,Yummy and the place was packed full of hungry families!!!   Keep up the customer service the great food and we will keep coming to your place!!! Our server was very busy but took care of us just fine- she kept those hot fries coming!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dardenne-prairie,,,,,
16,. ..,"Saint Peters, MO",0,1,,1.0,2016-01-09,"Terrible service,  Food was cold,drinks where empty and plates where stacked up the whole time  Will go to the midrivers location from now on",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dardenne-prairie,,,,,
12,Lori T.,"JAMAICA, NY",94,76,21.0,4.0,2016-02-12,I love Red Robin and this location is good. Great service - even better with the tablets. Clean bathrooms and plenty of fries to go around.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dardenne-prairie,,,,,
18,Robert W.,"Lake Saint Louis, MO",1,62,,1.0,2016-02-18,Different night same behavior.  This whole we'll give you more fries is a joke.  Tonight the waiter never stopped by until we were both finished and ready to leave.  He talked me into staying and would bring a refill of fries.  Did they EVER come out.  Don't know because after 5 mins we left.  Rip off advertising that they give you refills,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dardenne-prairie,,,,,
15,Toni M.,"Wentzville, MO",0,19,2.0,3.0,2016-02-23,"Oh, Red Robin! How I really want to like you! This is a very typical chain restaurant with ok food. I've always gotten the chicken sandwich, which is good in size, but not the greatest. The unlimited fries and sides are a good idea! I love the iPads for the kids!! Best $1.99 I will spend there!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dardenne-prairie,,,,,
11,Beau C.,"O'Fallon, MO",40,8,1.0,5.0,2016-04-02,"Theyve always had nothing but good service I couldn't understand why they had 3.5 stars. But they have always taken great care of us.  They have tablets at their tables for your Young & you to play with. Trivia Games, endless fries, open parking.  Next to movie theatre and a safe area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dardenne-prairie,,,,,
14,Senor M.,"Wentzville, MO",0,9,,3.0,2016-04-10,"The food is consistently good but appetizers are forgotten and one waiter is condescending and, frankly, creepy. We have started driving farther to the O'Fallon location just to avoid him.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dardenne-prairie,,,,,
17,Jack A.,"Wentzville, MO",0,6,,2.0,2016-04-28,the server brought the wrong burger by the time i got what i ordered my wife was done with her meal the manager did not come and apologize i feel like my bill should have been adjusted the food was pretty good though but it did bother me a bit,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dardenne-prairie,,,,,
9,John J.,"Wentzville, MO",0,11,,1.0,2016-11-15,"I wish I could give ""negative"" stars. This was their  ""2nd Chance"". We didn't have a good experience before but gave them the benefit of the doubt and went back. The table we were shown to had yet to be bussed. We had to stand in the middle of the restaurant waiting for someone to come service the table. It took an unusually long time to be acknowledged and our drink order to be taken. After waiting so long we put in our complete order, drinks, appetizer and entree. It took so long for the appetizer (fried pickles) to come out we discussed leaving. When the fried pickles were delivered they were cold and greased soaked. (Did I mention I had to flag someone down to get napkins and flatware?). My wife blotted one of the pickles with her napkin which left a huge orange grease spot on the napkin.       When we complained the waiter said he would send the manager over, but he never came. We decided to leave. On the way out, the hostess asked if we enjoyed our food. We told her we never got it.       To put all this in perspective... On the way out, we saw the people seated after us, finishing their meal.       It's simply not worth going back. We left and visited ""His and Hers BBQ"" where we have only had great experiences.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dardenne-prairie,,,,,
7,Robert W.,"Lake Saint Louis, MO",0,17,1.0,3.0,2017-09-05,"They can't figure out the service side in the bar.  The whole bottomless fries promo is rarely done.  The bartenders ended up doing drinks, handling to-gos, but tonight the bar area was almost empty.   Only reason its a 3 star vs 1 is that she told the manager who did offer a recovery, which I refused because I disagree on principal. Some people complain just to get free stuff, when you refuse it, you're legit and not happy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dardenne-prairie,,,,,
8,J S.,"Lake Saint Louis, MO",0,29,,5.0,2017-10-07,"I went by tonight, not knowing it was homecoming and everyone from the school district evidently went to Red Robin for dinner. It was packed but the wait was not anywhere near as bad as I would have thought. Service was ridiculous excellent considering this as well! I wish I remembered our servers name bc she was a pro. The food was good and prompt and she was always attentive. This restaurant really had it together tonight and they really deserve a lot of praise for their work. Great job guys!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dardenne-prairie,,,,,
6,Judy J.,"Saint Charles, MO",7,25,63.0,5.0,2017-10-30,"The food here is always good. One of my favorite places for a burger. If you don't like the family environment and a little bit of noise, this probably isn't the place for you. My kids love going here...good variety of food for them, crayons and activity menu to keep them busy, and always a balloon on the way out. Server was really attentive and nice on this visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dardenne-prairie,,,,,
4,Shakthi G.,"Los Angeles, CA",110,38,26.0,5.0,2017-12-03,This is the first Red Robin chain that I ever visited and I absolutely loved it. The food is one of the best compared to chain restaurants like Applebee's. I absolutely love their milkshakes along with the burgers. Will definitely visit more Red Robin restaurants after this.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dardenne-prairie,,,,,
5,Micinda T.,"Dardenne Prairie, MO",0,1,,4.0,2018-01-06,"Love this place! I always come in before I go and see a movie right across the street and the wait staff/cooks are always fast, accurate and friendly!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dardenne-prairie,,,,,
