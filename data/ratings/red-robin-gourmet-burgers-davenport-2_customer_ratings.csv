30,Roger S.,"Davenport, FL",0,6,,5.0,2016-07-13,Was their for a free food test / training opening and it was great. Would have like to get a beer with the burger but could not because it was not officially open but their root beer and orange cream soda was tasty.   It was our servers first day and he could not have done a better job. The food was prepared perfect and my wife is on a Gluten-Free Diet and their Gluten-Free hamburger roll is great.  The only problem I can see is this place will be packed and will have to go on off times. Great job guys wish you well.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-davenport-2?start=20,3.0920000000000005,3.0920000000000005,3.0920000000000005,3.0920000000000005,3.092000000000001

We had the pleasure of meeting Vanessa and Michael who I believe are management, both made a great first impression. We were seated and had Diaz has a server, who hands down had to be one of the best servers we've encountered at a chain restaurant. Our preview included an entree and a app for the table. We selected the Buzz Boneless wings, a Mad Love Finest burger, a Chili Chili Burger and kids' Mac and Cheese and Pizza. Our daughter didn't care for the pizza, nothing wrong she's just a bit picky, Michael was quick to replace it was a grilled cheese for us and checked back to make sure it was perfect. The food all arrived fresh, hot and exactly as ordered. Diaz was on the ball, he replaced drinks as needed, checked on us often and was very personable.

The kitchen doesn't know what is on the menu and how to make it, I ordered the tavern burger with mac and cheese and no spicy ranch and it came out missing the entire mac and cheese portion! The manager tried to tell me that the spicy ranch is in the mac and cheese but I ordered the same thing on my first visit and it came out fine. The manager Deshante Dickens was less than friendly and became argumentative with us, after trying to argue with us about the orders he said ""what do you want to make it ok"".

We've lived in the area for many years and were actually here when the exit off of I4 did not exist.  The area continues to expand and attract new businesses.  But Red Robin should have thought this through first.  Our advice is to skip this one and head north on 429 to the Villages location.  That site is better laid out, friendlier staff, more seating, etc.   We've at twice at the Champions Gate location with problems each time... wrong food, poor service, delayed service, bad food, etc.  Both times the manager on duty had to come to the table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-davenport-2?start=40,2.7560000000000002,2.7560000000000002,2.7560000000000002,2.7560000000000002,2.7560000000000002

Got pretzel appetizer and ran out of cheese dip after 4 pretzels. Still had 10 more pretzels but no dip. Server delivered my burger which was great but did not ask if I needed anything else. Dropped food and ran off. Three bites into my burger my drink was empty. Put glass at edge of table hoping my server who walked by three times would see it but never got my refill. Never saw a Mgr who usually stop by to check on service and meal.

Once again staff was very nice but food took approximately 15 minutes longer than I was told for my to go order. While the fries were hot, once again the food was severely lacking. The fries were not seasoned at all!! The tuscan mac n cheese was $7 and it was in a small container that was barely filled and overcooked!!  The onion rings were cold and soggy. The only thing made right was my husband's bleu cheese burger. If it was not for Kevin's service tonight this would be a one star review.

Families with (lots of) kids seem to fill the table area and it makes for a loud evening.  I will def go back the next time I feel the need to satisfy my apparent,periodic need for ground beef and mushrooms.  The service was pretty good for a busy Friday nite our waitress was attentive but not stalky so it was a good experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-davenport-2?start=20,3.08,3.08,3.08,3.22,3.0800000000000005

I've been here a number of occasions since my first review and I now have a favorite burger and dessert. The black and bleu burger is stacked with blue cheese crumbles and sauce, portobello mushrooms and sautéed onions on a ciabatta bread bun. It's packed so high with ingredients I have to finish the other half at home later. For dessert the chocolate fruffles are to die for! Super rich brownie strips covered in chocolate and sea salt with raspberry dipping sauce. It's the perfect item to share. The service has improved the most. Everyone I've encountered has been pleasant, kind, and helpful with suggestions and that extends to the servers and bar staff alike. On one occasion my coworkers and I called and found out they were finally taking phone orders.

None of the ingredients over-powered the taste of the actual meat. Really well balanced. Our waitress, I believe her name was Nancy was really sweet and attentive. She constantly made an effort to make sure we were enjoying our meal. I also noticed she took care of her customers at other tables with the same sense of urgency.

Our server was attentive and chatty. He put on the Thursday night NFL game on the Tv right in front of me and I thought that little step extra was amazing. I ordered the ghost pepper burger and loved it. It's got some very intense heat as the cheese and sauce have ghost peppers in them. It's topped with fried jalapeño peppers to add a hint more of heat. Our server was on point when it came to delivering on their bottomless fries. We just about finished the first round when he brought us another basket. This is also the first place to ever cook my burger right. My wife and I love the chocolate truffle fries for dessert, but our server almost sold us on the donut tower. If we weren't hooked on the truffle fries, we would have tried it. The location is right off of I-4 in champions gate.

A meeting at the start of the dinner rush? Food was unexceptional; 4 out of the 6 plates had something wrong. One was comp'ed and removed from bill.

I was familiar with the business, so I knew what to expect from the business.  For those of you who do not know about the business, this business is famous for their burgers. They create strange tasteful burger options from a small bite to a large meal of various flavors in every bite. Have a burger with a egg on top; BBQ burger with onion straws, BBQ sauce, and Bacon. Or my favorite: Chili Burger that comes with actual Chili on top of the burger. Very messy, but taste amazing!! If you do not like burgers, they offer chicken, salads, and other similar dishes. The best part (and most unhealthy part) is the Bottomless fries. Think about eating as many you want of very tasting Steak Fries. Very dangerous in my opinion.  The Pretzel bites Appetizer with the Beer Cheese is amazing. I highly recommend getting those to share or have them for yourself. The Beer Cheese sauce taste great and I like to use it for my fries.  You can order seasons to your fries for an additional small charge and order dipping sauce for free. The food menu offers creative dishes to enjoy, so why not have a delicious drink menu. Well they do. From endless Root Beer Floats to a Blue Moon Milk Shake. You read that right, a Blue Moon Milk Shake!!! They actual use Blue Moon beer in the milk shake. It taste amazing as well. If you love Blue Moon and milk shakes, then you will be Heaven with this tasty treat.  I actually got a small buzz from the drink. Sadly, these are not unlimited. They have other adventurous drinks that are non-alcohol. I love this place all around from the food to the fun decor inside. Friendly staff members, efficient service, clean tables, wonderful tasty dishes, and just a great place to dine with friends or family, this business has it all.  I hope you enjoy a great a burger with a Blue Moon Milkshake. Now I want a Blue Moon Milkshake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-davenport-2,3.08,3.08,3.08,2.768,3.0800000000000005

The meals were mac and cheese burger, tavern burger, kids birger, and mac and cheese with salad. The wait time was ridiculous. Over 40 min for these meals. The burgers were tasty though.

He said ""okay, okay, I'll take it off"" but when the bill came, the burger was still on it.  My youngest daughter pointed this out to the waiter who said the manager was on the phone. 15 minutes later, he finally came out.  My daughter who works for Disney pointed out how poor his customer service and attitude were and again, he said ""okay, okay, I'll take it off.  I have never written a bad review, but we will never eat here again.

They have a great concept with their gourmet style burgers, bottomless fries, and bottomless specialty drinks (was intrigued by their root beer float and flavored cream sodas, but ended up going with the prickly pear flavored purple lemonade). I haven't had prickly pear flavored anything since the last time I was in Arizona, so I was psyched to see this was an option with their flavored lemonades and it did not disappoint. It was a good balance between sweet and sour. I ate the ghost burger with garlic fries. I thought the burger was very good, the right amount of heat for someone who has a fairly high tolerance for spicy foods but doesn't want to be downing several glasses of water throughout the meal. I about liked that none of the food was overly greasy, which is a huge plus. The garlic fries were an interesting fry option and the fresh parsley was a nice touch. Service was also very good, very prompt and attentive.

Will gave us some recommendations and I wish we would have gotten the recommendations. I eventually had to ask to move to a different table that was a little bit warmer but not much. The food took a long time to arrive. There was a party of 8 that was seated way after us and left way before us. My wife ordered a shrimp and cod entree. She said the cod was awful and did not eat it. I had a burger with Mac and cheese on it. When it arrived, I had to ask Will where the mac and cheese was. He told me it was between the lettuce and bun. The portions were so small that I wondered why the plates were so small. After eating the food, I am glad the portions were small. I found the smallest amount on the burger. But it was not the lack of Mac that made the burger bad. There was some kind of sauce on it that made it spicy and I found horrible. Since we left, two hours ago, I have felt awful from what I ate. I have never felt this bad from something I ate. The coldness of the restaurant and awful food will make me not return.

Regular fries were cold, and lacked flavor, I might add. And then it was slow service when the food arrived.

We were given no compensation for all the missing parts, and very little sympathy for our troubles.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-davenport-2?start=20,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6
2,Keisha R.,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",0,46,36.0,4.0,2017-10-11,"This place is super busy. I ordered the new veggie burger and they confused my order with meat (ironic I know), so I had to wait again for my correct burger. They were nice about it and even took it off my check which I wasn't expecting but it was still bothersome to have to wait. The server brought out extra fries while I waited which was nice since I was starving.  The new veggie burger is delicious. It really has everything you need with avocados, mushrooms and swiss cheese my favorite.  My husband also ordered the tavern taco burger and he ordered it with meat for a little pink and they made it to perfection. Typically when he says some pink the burgers at other Red Robins locations they have no pink and are just well done.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-davenport-2,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
8,Brandon W.,"Kissimmee, FL",101,6,1.0,5.0,2017-10-12,"I had a Southwest Sambrero Salad. I added the Salmon to it and wow! It was amazing!! The food was fresh, the salmon was cooked perfectly. I would recommend the food to anyone! I sat at the bar on 10/11/17, the gentleman bartending was excellent. He was very friendly and good sense of humor, my refills were on point and made sure everything was perfect. I would recommend this place to anyone!  Thanks Red Robin!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-davenport-2,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72
6,M B.,"Davenport, FL",2,86,104.0,2.0,2017-11-18,"We have visited this particular Red Robin many times since they opened. It's always hit or miss as to how our experience is. Tonight we checked in and were told 20 minutes. We wait more than 40 as we watched tables after tables of people that arrived after us be seated. Our server Karen greeted us quickly, and took our drink orders as we looked at the menu. Once drinks were served, we ordered our food. We were a party of 5 and ordered burgers, fries, a cup of soup and a salmon dish that all took more than 45 minutes to arrive. The food was good and even the fries tasted fresh and hot (not always the case).  This restaurant is not high on our list to return to. When you start the experience off with others being seated before you and double the wait time and wait an extraordinarily long amount of time for this type of food, it makes for a lackluster experience that doesn't make you feel happy about your dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-davenport-2,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
0,Joe C.,"Tampa, FL",4,42,47.0,4.0,2017-11-24,"This is a newer location in an commercial area of town that's being built up.  Everything was very clean and modern looking.  The Red Robin menu has a wide variety of food choices and never disappoints.  If you love fries, you already probably like Red Robin :) We came on a busy day and it still felt like the staff took time to chat with us and Eric impressed us with his memory skills by taking our orders by memory alone and those at other tables and getting everything right, even with complex orders.   The food was served hot and was absolutely delicious.  The hand spun milkshakes were tasty but not a strong flavor which was only slightly disappointing.  It's a noisy sports bar environment but a great spot with a good menu and tasty food.  Prices are okay but a tiny bit more than I'd prefer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-davenport-2,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88
4,Wart H.,"Winter Park, FL",0,9,10.0,2.0,2017-12-30,"Good deals on burgers. However, the service continues to be consistently terrible. Went to tonight and got the ""oh that's my bad"" waiter who forgot everything and didn't pay attention. Why the F are we tipping you again? Had to remind on refills three or more times and he never checked in unless we called out as he walked past. It wasn't just our table too...his other table behind us walked out on him. Felt like wasted time and should have spent my $80 elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-davenport-2,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92
1,Liz D.,"Lakeland, FL",6,3,,2.0,2018-01-06,"I've been wanting to try Red Robin for a while, and finally talked my husband in to it on our way home from Orlando. Honestly, the only reason this is two stars and not one is because of the servers we had, and the dessert. Our server was super sweet, pretty prompt for the most part. She didn't ask us if we wants more fries (which is one of their selling points) other than that she was good.  My tween son got a bacon cheeseburger, my husband got some bbq burger--sorry I don't remember the name, and I got the guacamole burger. I couldn't taste the guacamole l, so I had to ask for a side of it. My husband said he really couldn't taste the bbq either. Burger flavor was ok.  My son got the Oreo milkshake, and enjoyed it. Kinda 'soupy' but everywhere is different. Hubs and I shared the mud pie and it was really good!  I think what bothered me the most about this trip was 3 tables around us sent food back. Something wasn't right in the kitchen tonight.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-davenport-2,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8
