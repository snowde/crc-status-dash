8,B G.,"Bettendorf, IA",1,45,6.0,4.0,2012-07-29,Great experience here.  Burger and pattie melt where good.  Onion rings are excellent.  We also had great service!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-davenport?start=20,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003
7,Brainmist K.,"Davenport, IA",0,15,,1.0,2012-08-26,"Blagh.  I was intent on a decent burger, after a really dismal meal a week before.  And to be honest, I was headed towards Ruby Tuesday, home of the best burger in town...only to discover they were closed.  NOOOO! But there was Red Robin.  I'd had a burger once before there, and it wasn't terrible. This time, though... The first burger (that's right, it was so bad I sent it back) was supposed to have onion strings on it.  Those unfortunately included several large pieces of cooked onion skin,  impossible to chew and completely disgusting.  I honestly thought I must have accidentally bitten a chunk of wrapper, but no.  A second bite revealed another leathery piece.  Apparently  whoever prepped the onions didn't bother peeling them first.  The rest of the burger was bland meat with too many types of toppings....the flavor could best be described as ""Blorch"". The next burger was marginally less objectionable, but this time it was hugely overcooked, and topped with no sauce, dressing, etc.  So dry, juiceless, bland, boring, and generally awful.   The bun was stale and dry.  I had been hungry before I came there, but I barely managed to eat half of this abomination to cows.  I didn't even bother having the remainder bagged for the dog; she has standards.  But the insult wasn't over: I spent the rest of the day with an upset stomach, belching up bad, overcooked beef.  Unpleasant to read about?  You bet.  And much more unpleasant to experience. For this I paid $10....the same as a savory, juicy, cooked-to-my-specs burger chock full o' awesome at Ruby Tuesday.  I could have gotten better, more flavorful, more satisfying food at Burger King or Checkers.  It is awful to think that this slophouse may have stolen business from the restaurant with the best burgers in town.  Oh wait, it's unfair to call it a slophouse.  Slops have some semblance of moisture.  It's a sad indictment of QC tastes.  Of course, there always seems to be demand for mediocrity. Don't eat here.  Unless you're 300 pound heifer with a firm belief that a Statue of Liberty wielding a burger is high art.  In which case, eat here until you cease being a burden on those of us with taste buds.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-davenport?start=20,2.468,2.468,2.468,2.468,2.468

That had to be one of  the best chicken sandwiches I ever had. Since then, they have removed it from the menu. It must be one of their best selling items, so it doesn't make sense why they'd just discontinue it. I have tried all of their other chicken sandwiches   and nothing comes even close. Now, about this location - it is just like any other Red Robin. Good atmosphere and attentive service. It is right next to  the movie theater, so the place is always packed.  P.S.

Out of the four times at this Red Robin, we were greeted & seated politely if not promptly & then we were forgotten three of those times. They have plenty of staff standing around but just don't seem to care, nor did what seemed to be the manager standing conversing with another waitress. I have NEVER got up & left after being ignored at a restaurant as I am usually the one at the table making excuses for them, but after 1 time of ok service & 2 times of barely any service And a few days ago just being ignored & not served, I must agree with others that it is the ""worst"" service EVER, Please don't include other locations as I have had great service in Arizona & California.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-davenport?start=20,,,,,

Typically after church, which is across the way. But I will say, the burgers are very good!! Excellent at times! The wait staff, most are just incredible! We walk in and the staff puts in for our fries and orders all our favorite dips to be brought to the table ASAP!  The variety is good. The salads are decent. Have them ""mix"" them for you. The new presentation is odd. But they are still decent sized. The fries are typically very good, with only occasionally being over salted or overdone. That is rare.

We got 8 rings!  The total bill was over $60 for two.  The food was great, the service was great, but the prices will keep us from coming back ... unless we hit the lottery.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-davenport,,,,,

I got the Great Northern Poutine Fries. Just for some background, I've had poutine in an American bar in South Korea, in Toronto and also in Davenport at Barrel House. So I've an idea of how good poutine can be at the right spot.  The poutine here is very bland, they overloaded it with mushrooms and fried the cheese curds (those I was okay with). The cup of gravy they brought out with the meal was tepid in temperature as was my friend's burger. She could taste that the burger was freshly made, just that the server probably didn't pick it up quick enough to give to her.  If I get poutine from this place again, I will make sure to tell them to hold the mushrooms, put bacon in there instead and bring out the food when it's still hot so more of the flavor can be tasted by the consumer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-davenport,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6

Service is mixed, mostly because the place is so large that it depends on so many factors. Food itself is usually fine, but it's made me sick a couple of times. Price is steep, but that's usually the result of all of their add-ons. You don't come out of there feeling like it was worth $50 for two with drinks. Noise level is usually through the roof, if you're into that kind of thing.  I would give it 1.5 if I could.
