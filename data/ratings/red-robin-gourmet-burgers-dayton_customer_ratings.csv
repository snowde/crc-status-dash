19,Jessie P.,"Dayton, OH",5,4,,3.0,2015-10-29,"The food is great, the atmosphere is fun, and the staff is super nice, but be prepared to suck in your belly to even walk around in the place. It's very cramped and difficult to do anything. My wife is a petite woman and we had to slide our table over so she could get out to use the restroom without knocking someone's drink over. I understand maximizing space to make the highest revenue, but this is absurd. People will fill the place up for the food and fun, but we will not come back because of the space issue. I mean, i had to pass the food to my wife because the server can't even fit between the tables to hand it off. Watching the servers struggle to move their filled trays around is both saddening and terrifying: like waiting to see if a house made of cards will come crashing down. Even they look very frustrated.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dayton,,,,,
10,Andy K.,"Englewood, OH",69,163,4.0,3.0,2015-11-21,"Three words from a friend of mine managed to get me back into a Red Robin:  ""They have poutine"".   While I've been somewhat down on Red Robin as a chain, primarily for being overpriced for the items being offered, I was excited to see a location open up along Miller Lane.  And, with my parents in town, the lure of that Canadian delicacy was just too much...we headed out for Red Robin. You know, I don't think I've ever seen a Red Robin location that wasn't jam-packed.  I'm not sure why that seems to be the case, but despite a phenomenally crowded entryway, we were seated within five minutes and drinks were brought shortly thereafter.  Therein lies the issue.  Our waitress seemed to be utterly oblivious to her surroundings.  She set down my mom's drink directly on the edge of one of a table, spilling the entire contents of the glass across the table.  Accidents happen, but the waitress barely seemed to even react, taking her time in setting down the other glasses and not even getting us napkins until about 5-10 minutes later. This continued into our actual orders.  Naturally, I ordered the poutine with no mushrooms (my mom is allergic and I don't care for mushrooms).  What did they come with?  Mushrooms.  Inattention, again, rears its head. The food itself wasn't bad.  My chicken sandwich was flavorful (even if the chicken breast itself was a touch on the skimpy side) and the gravy for the poutine was particularly savory.  I can't say that the food was mind-blowing, but the flavors were competent and everything was cooked properly (outside of our miscued poutine). So, again, the basic question comes down to ""Would I go again?""  And, while Red Robin certainly wouldn't be my first choice for an upscale burger along Miller Lane--I'd sooner go to Smashburger (as it's cheaper) or Max & Ermas (tortilla soup!)--I'd be willing to go again, if someone pressed me.  Red Robin's not bad, but they're out of their weight class.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dayton,,,,,
22,Debbie D.,"Vandalia, OH",1,70,,2.0,2015-12-19,"This was our first visit to a Red Robin.  We had a 35 minute wait and we were notified by text when our table was ready.  The waiting area is very small and not very comfortable.  We sat in a booth and only one side of the table could view the televisions. The dining area is very crowded with tables.  We would suggest a booth so at least you can have a little room.   Our order was taken quickly but it took a long time for our food to arrive.  The sandwiches were good but the bottomless fries were way too salty and seasoned for our taste.  Thankfully they did let us order ""plain fries"" which we strongly recommend. The restaurant was loud and some of the TV programs we found inappropriate - fighting with a lot of blood.  Overall if you would like a good sandwich, enjoy eating in a crowded environment and don't mind waiting a long time for a cheeseburger then this is the place for you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dayton?start=20,,,,,
21,Garrett L.,"Dayton, OH",0,9,3.0,3.0,2015-12-22,The service was very timely and how the food came out very well and completely delicious the pos system went down for about 15 mins but great time there,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dayton?start=20,,,,,
16,2005sporty ..,"Miamisburg, OH",0,15,5.0,4.0,2016-01-02,"Our first time to Red Robin. Food was top notch. Service was really good. Only problem was our server kept asking if we were ok like she was part of our group. Other than that she was beyond good but not great. Wait time wasn't very long maybe 10 min. Waiting area was a bit crowded and uncomfortable. Restrooms were clean and did not smell like a sewage plant. A little rough to get around because of the closeness of the tables. Had to turn to see a tv, but a few more and would be able to see one from all angles. Will we go back, yes we will, next time we go to Miami Valley Shooting Grounds.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dayton,,,,,
20,Carrie T.,"Dayton, OH",0,28,,2.0,2016-01-16,Terrible....extremely crowded space. We felt like we were dining with strangers at our table. So much so we couldn't have a private conversation. The service wasn't terrible but the environment ruined the entire experience. I will make the drive to the Fairfield Commons location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dayton?start=20,,,,,
17,Lori E.,"Dayton, OH",19,3,,1.0,2016-01-30,"75 minute wait, ok it's a Saturday night. We wait, get a table, drinks arrive, then the waitress after taking our orders tells us the kitchen is an hour behind and it will be an hour wait for food. Unbelievable! Whoever designed this place apparently didn't think it would be very busy....extremely small. So totally disappointed",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dayton,,,,,
14,Barry B.,"Dayton, OH",38,3,2.0,1.0,2016-01-30,I just picked up a to go order and the hamburger was  half eaten it wasn't my order at all they must have picked it up out of the fucking trash. I'm totally pissed off I want to call the police,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dayton,,,,,
15,Jei R.,"Vandalia, OH",2,56,9.0,3.0,2016-02-25,"Positives: Food was very good. Burger was delicious, my wife really enjoyed her Cobb salad and their Thai sauce went well with the fries. We try to go to Red Robin at off hours, so no problems with wait times and noise level that others mention. I like how you can pay your bill at the table. Not so important when we go, but at a busy lunch that would be nice. And convenient location if you live in Vandalia. Most of the places we like to go are 20-30 minutes away, so it's nice having somewhere we can run to close by.  Negatives: Ok, my biggest pet peeve is that they got rid of the wrappers. Still bitter. Otherwise, meh...the burgers are a bit on the expensive side, and the ciabatta buns are forgettable. No big complaints. We've never had a bad meal.  Summary: Five Guys is my favorite for simple burgers, but Red Robin has a wider selection of burgers, salads, drinks, chicken, and deserts. All good from what I've had. For burgers franchises in the area, probably my #2.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dayton,,,,,
13,Katie M.,"Cincinnati, OH",61,54,34.0,2.0,2016-03-30,"World's slowest service. Coke was not refilled. Endless fries, were not refilled. Had to beg for a to go cup of Coke. Food was dependably good, but get it to go. Oh, and if you've never visited a Red Robin, expect it to be loud. I knew this going in, so it didn't impact my rating, I just wanted to add that tip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dayton,,,,,
11,Stephen W.,"Vandalia, OH",16,53,64.0,3.0,2016-06-11,I really enjoy eating here the service is great and food is wonderful. They always seem very fast with our orders and food is high quality. Endless fries are a plus. The major problem I have here is the pricing. There prices are outrageous for fries and burgers and drinks. For 3 people with tip the bill was over 60.00. The pricing is why I reviewed at 3 stars.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dayton,,,,,
9,Mateo B.,"Dayton, OH",0,9,12.0,5.0,2016-11-15,The food is excellent and they have a great staff. Had the chicken bruschetta sandwich and loved it. That ciabatta bun is fantastic. Bottomless steak fries were on point.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dayton,,,,,
18,Laura B.,"Parkersburg, WV",0,9,,1.0,2016-11-19,"I have been to this location twice total and both times we have had slow service, long wait times and sub par food. We waited for 45 minutes total for a 5 seat table. We were told it was going to be 40 minutes at most. When we finally got seated, we gave the waitress our drink and appetizer order. We waited. The table beside us was seated, and the same waitress took care of them. They not only had their drinks before us, but their appetizer and FOOD. We never received our appetizer, and the gentlemen that was sat after us as well, received his appetizer and his meal before us. We were offered a hurried apology, and nothing else. In hindsight, we should've asked to speak to a manager, but at that point, our food was brought to us and I was just ready to eat and get out of there. Will probably never go again, or wouldn't go at such a busy time, since they obviously cannot handle it. The Red Robin in Beavercreek Ohio is much more efficient and their food actually tastes better. So after a total of two hours, we're finally home. Just very disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dayton,,,,,
6,Steve M.,"Liberty, IN",4,49,,1.0,2016-11-25,"If I could give fewer stars I would!  Went with the family and thought we'd get a couple drinks at the bar before being seated.  Many many seats open at the bar and we had our HS age son with us.  Apparently, it's a company rule that he couldn't be at bar area.  There is hardly anywhere to wait in the lobby.  We eat out a lot and this has never been a problem in Ohio.  I'm giving up my Red Robin royalty card and will not be back.  On top of that, the restaurant has been slow and the dining area had a lot of dirt on floors and seats.  Go local and stay away from this place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dayton,,,,,
5,Adrienne M.,"Wanatah, IN",28,1,,4.0,2017-02-27,Food and service was excellent!!  It's refreshing to have an attentive server!! Cissy is awesome! She made us want to return soon !!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dayton,,,,,
7,Kelly A.,"Longs, SC",99,53,2.0,2.0,2017-03-20,"Wait was about 1 hour when told half hour, stood around the bar and decided to order an appetizer to start and eat it while waiting for out table.  Found hair in my chips and queso, the girl at the bar said, Im sorry it was probably mine! Was that supposed to make me feel better.  NOT... Finally got seated and waited forever on our meals.  Not a great experience.  Probably wont return to this particular Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dayton,,,,,
3,Carlos C.,"Vandalia, OH",1,69,17.0,5.0,2017-03-26,"This place was crowded today. They told me 40 minute wait and I waited about 45, no biggie, close enough. I was a little worried because it was so crowded and it took a while for the waitress to take our order. However, the food came relatively quick and service was excellent. My wife ordered the burning love with crispy chicken instead of beef. We recommend it, its the ultimate chicken sandwich. My son had the royal and I had the Avo-Cobb salad. I know, a salad at Red Robin, but I'm on a diet and determined to lose those pounds. The Cobb salad wad excellent, huge portion. I added the jalapeño that came with the burning love and that gave it a great touch. I am low carbing it, so I had the blue cheese dressing and came out of there satisfied.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dayton,,,,,
12,Kim R.,"Longboat Key, FL",0,2,,1.0,2017-07-05,Went there about a year ago for a birthday. They brought the wrong order to my daughter and I had a long black hair in my fries.

2,Roberta R.,"Brookville, OH",7,117,103.0,4.0,2017-07-14,"Red Robin serves our family's favorite burgers. We all love to eat here. Endless sides are a bonus; too bad the standard side, steak fries, are pretty boring. The freckled lemonade is awesome, though, and also comes with free refills, despite being a premium drink. Service is always okay, nothing exceptional but never bad. I gave 4 starts vs. 5 because I just don't think this restaurant feels comfortable. It's too crowded and loud and cold (literally and figuratively). The 2-tops are just tiny, especially with all their junk on the table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dayton,,,,,

8,Brian G.,"Miamisburg, OH",0,3,,1.0,2017-09-06,"The staff and cooks need to take a trip to Beavercreek's Red Robin to see how it's done.  Long wait with not many customers waiting; rude, inattentive wait staff; dirty tables and floor; food way below par; and the seating set up feels like a bad buffet dining room.  I love Red Robin, but you can have this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dayton,,,,,
1,Michael E.,"Tipp City, OH",0,49,83.0,3.0,2017-11-15,Not a good start- no one to greet us at the host stand @ 5 pm on a Saturday and a couple in front of us already waiting.  Eventually greeted within a couple minutes.  The atmosphere was cool on a hot day but could be cleaner.  Told wait for 2 was 5 minutes and they kept their word on that.  The server took a little longer than normal to greet but was willing to take the full order sensing we were ready.  Didn't delay us by only taking the drink order.  Food was fine.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dayton,,,,,
0,Ben S.,"Dayton, OH",43,55,39.0,5.0,2017-12-20,"I love robin. They consistently have great burgers. My favorite is the original burger, the royal Red Robin burger. This bad boy has all the burger fixings plus an egg, and bacon. Omg it's so good. There buns are always fresh and soft. Service is always quick. This particular Red Robin can be hard to get a seat during busy hours because of its relatively small dining room. Many times my wife and I have by passed this by just sitting at bar. I absolutely love there onion rings with campfire sauce. It's a zingy dark orange sauce with a little heat. I've had salads, chicken, apps, and burgers. Everything is fresh, prepared to my liking and down right delicious. Make sure to try there milkshakes, before you go. They have seasonal ones that will knock your socks off! Yummo!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dayton,,,,,
