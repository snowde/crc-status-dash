58,Ben W.,"Woodbury, NJ",56,98,7.0,3.0,2013-02-05,"We ate here yesterday during the grand opening. I expected to encounter a few snags and we certainly did. In the spirit of fairness, I will return in a few months to see how they're doing. In the meantime I recommend you to wait a while for them to get it together, and then give them a chance.      After placing our order, we waited a full 15 minutes until everything arrived simultaneously; the drinks, the appetizers, the kid's meal, and the entrees. This was annoying, of course. Had they been open for a longer time, I would have been much more angry about this. But as it is, they're still finding their rhythm.           The food itself was pretty good but nothing special. The menu is comparable to a more modernised Chili's but with slightly less Tex Mex influence. They have bottomless fries with every burger, which is nice, and a wide variety of dipping sauces as well as a jar of seasoned salt on the table.       The fried zucchini appetizer was far too thick; each stick was about an inch and a half wide, cold, and not crispy at all. The onion rings, on the other hand, were so overbreaded and crispy that the forgotten onion inside would slide right out when bitten.        Their burgers have the usual interesting toppings that you'd expect to see, which are fun. But the patty itself is a little on the dry and bland side. The burgers were definitely average and did not win me over, which does not bode well for a place that specializes in burgers.      I just feel like Red Robin can't compete with the superior burger joints in this area. (see my reviews of ""25 Burgers"" and ""Five Guys""). If they do succeed, it will be because they are in the mall and can attract guests with the sheer convenience of their location.         This location does have beer available (and possibly liquor, I'm not certain) and an interesting sounding Guiness Milkshake. When I come back I will definitely see what that's all about. And burgers are not the only thing they serve; look at their menu and you may see something that excites you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-deptford?start=40,3.372,3.372,3.372,3.372,3.372
59,Marianna L.,"Glassboro, NJ",207,171,,3.0,2013-02-12,"A good experience over all. We had to wait about five-ten minutes for a table, but that was about it.  We personally knew our server so she took extra good care of us, so I can't say anything bad about the service at all! The food was great. I had the Guac/Bacon burger, cooked with no pink, on a whole wheat bun. The whole thing was delicious! The unlimited fries were great too, and I dipped them in Thai Chili, Ranch and Honey Mustard dressings. The seasoned salt on the table is a nice touch. I would recommend that if you do go here for dinner, do not make plans afterward if you have a weak stomach. Although the food quality was good, my stomach couldn't handle the grease, and about an hour later I was feeling sick.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-deptford?start=40,3.308,3.308,3.308,3.308,3.308
78,Michelle C.,"Woodbury, NJ",0,6,,5.0,2013-02-22,"My husband and I went here for Valentine's Day...not so romantic but that's ok. We had intended to be early to a local ""steakhouse"" but were unsuccessful. So, Red Robin was not our first choice. We were very happy with our meal and service. While the place we wanted to go had a 1 hr wait, we were seated at RR within 10 minutes. Don't get me wrong, they were quite busy and got busier as our meal progressed. We were attended to quickly and had our questions answered in a timely manner. Our drinks came quickly and the ""endless bottom"" did not disappoint. My hubby got a burger and requested it to be ""as pink as they would allow"". He was very pleased with it (he can be fussy about his ""rare"" burgers). I ordered the fish and chips. I also was happy with how it was cooked. I was offered more ""bottomless fries"" but was too full to take advantage of them. We had two different managers stop by to see how our dining experience was, which was nice. We enjoyed our meal so much that we requested their Red Royalty card. We look forward to going back soon to start racking up perks on our card. One tip...if you want a more private dinner, request to be seated away from the windows that face the mall entrance. We had a few curious onlookers (mostly kids) while we ate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-deptford?start=60,3.4760000000000004,3.4760000000000004,3.4760000000000004,3.4760000000000004,3.476000000000001

54,Jason P.,"Somerdale, NJ",36,166,,3.0,2013-02-25,"I won't take into account that we waited over an hour for a table, because I expected nothing less on a Saturday night around 5:30.  Went here with a fairly large group as they all were interested in trying the place.  If you do come on a Saturday I would suggest going either before 5 or after 7.  Just so you don't have the ridiculous wait. Anyway, the service was really good.  Which I wasn't expecting from a new place with such a new staff.  Never waited long for refills and special requests.  A+ in my book. Onto the food, my girlfriend and I shared the pick two appetizer with fried zucchini and onion rings.  First the zucchini...it is just way too thick to really enjoy.  The zucchini was certainly fresh, but not enjoyable in the form they cook it.  It's almost an inch think and very tasteless.  Avoid this.  The onion rings were standard fare, obviously frozen, not fresh.  If you enjoy this, go ahead and order.  Just don't get your hopes up with super high quality. I ordered a bacon cheese burger with pepper jack, thousand island dressing and crunchy fried onions.  I had ordered this medium, but came out well done.  I'll attribute this to the insane volume of the night.  So, the burger was a tad dry, but not inedible.  Everyone else had burgers as well, and they all really enjoyed them.  1 star was knocked off for the dryness of the burger, and 1 for the disappointing appetizer. We did order the Oreo shake which was incredibly tasty.  Will order that again. They have a full bar and interesting cocktails.  They also have bottomless fries (which I didn't wind up getting more because I was too full) and some bottomless drink options. If you like burgers, it's worth a try.  They do have other options like chicken sandwiches (which they will substitute chicken for any burger choice) and some ribs/chicken finger platters.  I noticed they did have vegan and vegetarian options, which I know people will like.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-deptford?start=40,3.2120000000000006,3.2120000000000006,3.2120000000000006,3.2120000000000006,3.212000000000001

Manager ended up giving us free desserts. Well priced and really yummy food. I got the garden burger with sweet potato fries and coleslaw. The latter was a very small portion. Had a raspberry tea to drink. I am very picky about teas, and I found theirs to be unsweetened with raspberry flavored shots - was tasty. For dessert, I had the brownie ice cream thing: generic chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream, but they also put a strawberry sauce under it which was a nice touch. I really appreciate all the options they offer. Both vegan and vegetarian burgers, plus gluten free buns. So considerate.

30,Kathleen D.,"Richmond, VA",797,1719,11836.0,4.0,2013-03-01,"I first tried Red Robin about a year ago in Delaware and instantly became hooked. Unluckily, there were no Red Robins near my home until last month, which meant quick stops when traveling out of state. The Deptford location is in the mall next to Boscovs, which is pretty random, but the set up with glass windows looking into the mall is pretty neat. Despite only being open less than a month, the staff seemed to have everything under control. I went on Thursday night and had to wait about 40 minutes for a table, but it was worth it. I always get the crispy chicken sandwich and it tasted as good as usual. I also tried the pretzel bites and they disappeared quickly! Now, I just have to go back sometime soon and see if their drinks (namely: frozen strawberry margarita and daiquiri) add up to the other locations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-deptford?start=20,3.248,3.248,3.248,3.248,3.248
75,R O.,"Sicklerville, NJ",2,20,1.0,3.0,2013-05-12,I was here just the other night for dinner while I waited for my son's glasses to be done. The food was basically all burgers. They have a good selection of ways they prepare them and they were tasty. You get unlimited fries w/ your entree which is good for big eaters. I ordered 2 Blue Moon beers at a cost of 4.79 each which is way to high priced. The service is fast and wait staff was polite.

60,Ryan M.,"Gloucester Township, NJ",2,5,4.0,3.0,2013-08-27,"Finally visited this new location in Deptford. I first discovered Red Robin log before it came to my area and have always been a fan.  This wasn't the best of experiences but it wasn't that bad. My server seemed confused and busy, however we appeared to be one of two tables he had, and it was a slow time. But I keep in mind this is a new location and a new staff, he still did his best to be attentive so I didn't mind. I was given the wrong burger, I ordered a double and got a big tavern burger. I ate it anyways and it was great! Also tried one of their cocktails, for the price and size I thought it was great. My fries were perfect too, I didn't have room to take them up on their bottomless fries and I enjoyed the portion I was given.    My girlfriends wrap was full of sauce, which was displeasing. It pretty much took away from all other ingredients. Also the fruit salad she got in lieu of fries was not fresh. It appeared to be soaked in a sauce or juice and it made for an unappetizing fruit salad.

50,Jay R.,"Audubon, NJ",31,63,150.0,4.0,2013-10-21,"I quite enjoy this place. I use the Red Robin royalty card which seems to make visits to the place seem very affordable. I've had quite a few burgers on their menu. The classic Red's Tavern Double is my favorite because it is a small burger that still has two patties on it (I like a meaty bite!) It's also one of, if not the cheapest burger on the menu. It comes with the unlimited fries still, so you can load up on them if the burger is too small. The appetizers I've had were very good so far, from the pretzel bites with the great mustard, to the mini brat corn dogs, with a different great mustard. I've also had the yukon chips and dip, the chips are great but one time I swear we were given straight up ruffles rather than the yukon chips. Other good burgers I've had include the Oktoberfest burger which had salty ham on it which was really an interesting twist. I've also had the Royal Red Robin which is good, but I don't order it anymore. It comes with a sunny side up egg, but I always ask for it to be hard cooked. I've also had the spicy burger with the fried jalapenos on it, which was a disappointment. The service is half or half... we've had two great waitresses and two not so great. I'm also had my burger come to my table missing almost all of its toppings.  I like that it's in the mall, so you can go shopping before or after. I'm not looking forward to the Cherry Hill store as much since its been relegated to a nearby shopping center instead of the mall itself. The TVs also only show ESPN... boring. The unlimited drinks are nice, especially the specialty ones like a root beer float or the Freckled Lemonade. It is a bit disappointing that you must pay to upgrade your side to other items, but then they are not unlimited. How about cheaper upgrades to one serving and a higher priced unlimited upgrade?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-deptford?start=40,2.9600000000000004,2.9600000000000004,2.9600000000000004,2.9600000000000004,2.9600000000000004

Fortunately, there's this local store and a new Cherry Hill location that just opened. My 2nd visit here was this past Sunday around 4:30. We had a party of 3, and there was no wait for a table. The hostess acted very confused and unnecessarily weaved us around taken tables several times before seating us in a booth. We were quite happy as the Eagles game was still on and they had 15+ TV's all tuned to that channel! Our server was timely in taking our drink orders as we perused the menu. I ordered the Bleu Ribbon Burger (my favorite!). Almost 1/2 hour later, our food arrived. The burgers were very good. However...by the time the food arrived, the Eagles games was over. There was a later game on CBS, but all the TV's remained on the FOX post-game show. We asked our server if we can get the later game turned on. We had to make a 2nd request when our server came to check on us. Then the ""manager"" came over to ask us what game we wanted (the server actually had to point him to our table!). After 5 minutes of fiddling with a remote, finally ""managed"" to figure out how to change 1(!) of the TV's to the 2nd game on CBS.  Seriously? They're killing the Sunday football crowd.

39,Mike T.,"Harrison Township, NJ",35,90,121.0,2.0,2014-11-20,"Hot mess, cold food. Was seated fairly quickly on a Thursday afternoon. No server to be found, so the manager took our order with an apology. Overall, there was a feeling of chaos as servers jogged from table to table, bobbing and weaving, avoiding eye contact. The guy seated across from us tried desperately to get someone, anyone, to take his bill as he had been finished eating quite some time ago. 25 minutes later, we commented to each other about how long our food was taking, and wondered if ours was the food that was basking in the warm glow of the heat lamps. Someone overheard us, and promised to bring our food out shortly. When it did arrive, it was cold and not worth the wait. Our server basically did a drive-by serving, and we didn't have a chance to inform her that we had no silverware or napkins. Off she ran, narrowly avoiding the man who was still desperate to pay his bill. My Smoke and Pepper burger was a disappointment. The signature fries tasted as though they were reheated on a hot sidewalk. Everyone working there seemed frustrated. No one came to check on us, and we grabbed the server to tell her our food was cold when we got it. We almost had to set a trap in order to capture her as she darted by. She was nice enough about it, and told us she would take off the chicken sandwich, that was not edible, from our bill... so I'll add a star. Not sure why this place can't seem to get it together. Perhaps the manager should stick to managing rather than taking food orders for his staff. It isn't even as large as most Red Robin restaurants that I've been to.

It was actually really delicious. The service here though has always been subpar. I usually get the under enthused waiter who likes to make jokes about how his job sucks, or the unmotivated waitress with black rimmed glasses who is sarcastic and doesn't seem to care.. about anything. I almost want to offer her a hug or something. Tonight two in my party ordered the french onion soup. They said it tasted like water with a bouillon cub in it- and no onions.

Because of this, my daughter was finished her dessert before my meal even arrived.

I told the server that I was not likely to return while they use this system and that I would give that feedback to corporate. She needed to help us when we paid because the paper for the receipt was loaded backwards and the receipt was blank. There was a button on the screen to leave feedback, but she cleared the button for me without my being able to leave the feedback.

I've only eaten here once, thankfully on a weeknight so there were no festering globs of teenagers milling around. This was also my first experience with the tablets Red Robin has started to incorporate into their chain. It was cool, but we didn't use it. Drinks came out quickly, food came out quickly, and a refill of fries came out quickly. I got the smoke and pepper burger, I think that's what it's called, and my boyfriend got some kind of chicken thing. The burger was good but saturated with grease and was falling apart in my hands. Whatever. Sometimes you just want a good ol' unhealthy meal of meat and cheese and carbs. Two burgers and two beers came to, wow, $43. I'm not saying it wasn't worth it but that's pretty dang expensive. ALSO, you pay your bill through the tablet and make sure to read over the % of tip you're giving the server. The computer automatically hikes it up to 18-20%. I'm all for servers making a living wage, but with the computers they don't have to be as attentive to you. Our service was nice, but only came over twice over the course of our meal and that doesn't really warrant almost a $9 tip.  It's a burger joint in a mall and eating there is a hit or miss.

The food, burgers and fries, are good, the service timing is hit or miss (more often a miss), and the wait for a table is moderate. This location has recently undergone a makeover so it's looks a little more contemporary than the previous Ground Round-esque ticky-tacky stuff on the walls theme. I will say that every employee we've had interactions with have been nothing short of polite and eager to please. Last night our appetizer literally came out 90 seconds before our main dish, and this type of pile-up isn't uncommon. I mean, we ordered the appetizer because we were hungry and wanted to nosh before our burgers. If we didn't even have time to eat it before our dinner arrived, what's the point? I feel like this is more a kitchen issue than a server issue, and like I said, we've learned to accept it. So yes, if you're looking for a fine dining experience, keep looking.

My husband had the tavern mac burger ( burger with macaroni and cheese on it )  I had the salad with crispy chicken. The food was great. The service was great, she even came over and asked my husband if he wanted more fries ( other times we have dined there, this did not happen ).  My only complaint was the entertainment fee for playing games on their mini computer. I think the prices are high enough to allow the games to be free. It is only $1.99 so it would not break the bank, the restaurant can absorbed the cost and it would be a good selling point!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-deptford,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68

24,Alina S.,"Washington Township, NJ",1,3,,1.0,2017-02-12,"You want a good burger you go to Red Robin right? Well not anymore. My meal this afternoon was bad but not as bad as the excuses given by the kitchen manager. There were three of us dining, all burgers, two were burnt to the point where they were hard and blackened, the third was rare still. Fries were all cold. The blazing love burger was a bust, the tomato was mealy, the shredded lettuce they thoughtfully threw on there was limp and old, and they should just give up on the (soggy) fried jalapeños bit. Our waitress was great, and having waited many tables I knew the bad burger wasn't her fault and asked to speak to the kitchen manager simply to inform him of the poor presentation of food, not at a means to get a remake or a discount. A smiley man in a gingham shirt greeted us, attempting to kneel at a raised table he probably needed to tiptoe towards, almost immediately offered us 25% off the bill. We attempted to inform him of where his line cooks may need assistance as this is a burger joint and the burgers aren't even done well. Gingham interrupted to inform us of his short staffing issues, shift changes, and how two people quit/were fired today. He didn't inquire about what burger was disastrous as I tried to explain my attempts at eating my meal, rather he wanted to send us home with more bad food or give us the discount as he clearly valued us as customers. After reviewing that the three of us didn't even eat a whole burger between us we requested to only pay what we actually ate, gingham then comped our meal. Ging did not need to do that rather acknowledging what was actually going wrong in his kitchen would have given us more satisfaction than saving us the few bucks. I have worked at many restaurants, many corporate/chain restaurants, and this was not only distasteful service, but I assume gingham just shoots a smile and a discount at all problems this restaurant has rather than exploring any changes necessary, possibly why he continues to have short staff and retention problems, not to mention the bad food. Red Robin used to be a good place to get burgers, now it's a good place to get a discount I guess.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-deptford?start=20,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6

I ordered the harissa salmon burger.  Good, but not something I'd order again for the price.  The lemon wheels got lost in the sandwich and the salmon was a little dried out.

12,George S.,"Clementon, NJ",0,2,,1.0,2017-07-05,"WORST SERVICE EVER. I gave the Jennifer, the waitress, $1.00 tip which was a 95¢ more than she deserved. I ordered the burger which was fine. I also ordered the onion rings instead of the fries. Fries are bottomless, onion rings are not - even though you pay extra for them (never understood that since onions are MUCH cheaper than potatoes, but all restaurants do it).  My friends ordered more fires and I ordered more onion rings. The waitress Jennifer said that onion rings are not bottomless. She should have told me that when I ordered them, but she didn't. When she was told that another red Robin gives bottomless, she told us not at the Deptford store. She went to put the order ion and asked if I needed more soda (at least that had free refills). I told her yes. A few minutes later the manager came over with the fries refills and explained to me that they do not do bottomless onion rings. He did offer to take the extra $1.49 off my bill. I would have preferred he gave me the free refills on the rings ""this time"", but he did offer to take the extra off the bill, so he did resolve the issue. BTW - the order of onion rings was 3 small rings and 2 medium rings - hardly worth the extra money. After the manager left, a few more minutes passed and the waitress asked if everything was a ok. I said I am still waiting for my soda refill that I asked for 10 minutes ago. She said okay or something to that effect.Then she goes to pour the soda and winds up taking care of another table. I am a very patient person, but if I already told that I asked for more soda 10 minutes earlier, that should be a rush order, especially when we were only about 20 feet from the soda fountain. In my opinion, she should not have that job. She was the absolute worst waitress I have ever had. I had only 13¢ in coins in my pocket and I felt guilty leaving her just that amount, but if I did leave it, she still would have been over-tipped. Again Jennifer should not have a job in a restaurant. If she wants a job serving food, it should be somewhere like a fast food place where you do not need to wait on tables.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-deptford,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8

I am not a huge burger person, but they had Nachos on the menu so that's what I ordered.  They were ok. I wasn't crazy about the chili they put on them.

Plus she loved the bottomless fries.  Hubby ordered a whisky burger. He said it was good.

8,Christopher G.,"Sewell, NJ",1,1,,1.0,2017-10-28,"This afternoon my family and I stopped into the Red Robin Gourmet Burgers in Deptford, NJ. We really appreciate the feature of texting when your table is ready. We received our text and 2mins later were seated. The hostess even greeted us by name which became a joke about how she could know it was us. 5mins after that we received another text saying ""please come claim your table"" while we were already seated. Several mins later the hostess came and questioned us about our reservation. 5 mins later she then came back to the table and essentially berated us for taking another reservation. She said we ""were causing havoc"" for the staff and the people that should have had our table. She was loud and obnoxious and greatly embarrassed us, even prompting the table next to us to ask what was happening. We spoke to a manager who did apologize for the treatment but was essentially dismissive of the complaint because we were incorrectly logged in the system as a ""walk"", even though we were seated 2mins after the initial text and hadn't walked. I'm very disappointed in the way we were treated, so much so that I couldn't finish my meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-deptford,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8

1,Kevin B.,"Torrance, CA",3,60,,1.0,2018-01-01,"I've eaten a Red Robin plenty of times with good experiences.  Not this one.  Stay far away.. it started out bad and got really bad.  We were seated for a party of 7 after about 20 minutes.  4 kids and three adults.  The floors were filthy with food still all under the tables and chairs.  So disgusting that no one bothered sweeping a little.  The tables next to us remained uncleaned from the prior patrons for well over half an hour.  The place was super busy so I get it. The waiter was a really nice guy and I realize not everything was his fault.  But the manager of this place.. I'd seriously question his/her abilities to manage at all. Our order was taken and we were told that there was no silverware or plates.  Okay... yet with no silverware or plates they still brought  the appetizers.  We put the food on our napkins of which the waiter commended us for thinking outside the box.  Hmmm... Some of our drinks came - some didn't.  We asked several times. Then the plates came but no silverware - and no additional napkins to replace the ones we used to put our appetizers on.  Then the entrees came.  Awesome.  We waited, and waited.. and waited... finally my wife got up and asked for the silverware so we could eat but by then the food was cold and the kids were pretty grumpy.  The other drinks came some time later when the meal was almost over including a shake that was supposed to come before the meal was served. So - this was the good part.  At about 10:00 p.m. my daughter threw up.  Then at about 2:00 a.m. my wife and youngest son started throwing up and haven't stopped since (it's now 10:00 a.m.).  The three of them had shared a small pepperoni pizza.  The other 4 of us didn't have any of the pizza and are all fine.  So.. you tell me?  I wonder how many people that ate at Red Robin and had the pizza got sick.... bad service, dirty restaurant.. eat salads with your hands.. (why serve the food if there are no utensils?)  Couldn't they have brought the ""to go"" utensils?  In my opinion just poorly managed then to top it off with 3 of us getting really sick.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-deptford,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68
