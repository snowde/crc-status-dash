31,Michael V.,"Longwood, FL",6,150,1.0,1.0,2012-12-14,"I travel all over the country and have eaten at many Red Robins. This was by far the worst one I have ever been in. I should have known when I walked in and noticed a $2 for 22 ounce draft beer happy hour, and there was no one at the bar. In fact, I could count on one hand how many customers were in the whole place. Most Red Robins are ALWAYS packed with people.  The service was friendly, which was the only thing this place has going for it. They were out of one of the draft beers I wanted. I ordered my burger pink throughout, and it came pink, however dry as sawdust. How does that even happen? I could understand if I ordered it well done. The fries were ice cold. Literally, they were so cold they were chewy. I waited and waited to try to get some fresh ones. Finally, I had to walk up and ask the hostess to help me. This was the first time I couldn't wait to get out of a Red Robin. I normally love this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-detroit?start=20,2.5640000000000005,2.5640000000000005,2.5640000000000005,2.5640000000000005,2.564000000000001
15,Christina L.,"Royal Oak, MI",31,10,2.0,5.0,2013-03-24,"Alright, the only reason I'm putting a five star rating is because of Deborah, the bartender. Otherwise, my experiences as a guest isn't always the greatest at this location. Every time I've come in, to place a to-go order, I've had her to greet me. She is extremely professionals and kind. She always makes sure my to-go order is correct by showing me what I've ordered and letting me know the condiments she placed in the bag as well. She is just a sweet woman. I work in the restaurant industry as well, and she treats me the way I treat my guests, ladies and gentlemen serving ladies and gentlemen.  Thanks Deborah for great service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-detroit,3.0920000000000005,3.0920000000000005,3.0920000000000005,3.0920000000000005,3.092000000000001

He is from Toronto, so whenever he is in town I can almost guarantee that we'll be going to Red Robin. This item isn't on the menu, but they'll still make it for you. It's actually pretty good with extra red onions, and of course gralic fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-detroit?start=20,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003,2.8280000000000003
33,Nanette K.,"Allen Park, MI",0,22,17.0,1.0,2013-08-31,"Like others that have commented on this location I just want to say that other red robins are very good. But this one is not. It really does depend on the location. I usually go to the red Robin in Southgate, but happen to be in the area When we saw this Restaurant and we decided to try it. The hostess was on the phone when we walked in and didn't hang up for 30 seconds while we stood there. She was obviously on a personal call but did not seem to mind that she had customers. After she hung up she finally sat us and our waitress was very sweet. She was very new you could tell, but did not have anybody following her to train her. She was nice nonetheless so we gave her a chance. The food that came out was disgusting. My daughter ordered the French dip with au jus sauce. The bread was hard as a rock, the au jus was greasy, and the lettuce they put on the plate for garnish was completely dry and wilted. We let our waitress know and she offered to take the food off the bill, but did not offer anything else. The service was slow, the food was terrible, I would never go back. I'm going to post a picture of the food that we were served so you can see for yourself. The food was honestly terrible. Why pay that much money and waste your time when you're hungry for food that comes out looking like this. I'll stick to the Southgate location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-detroit?start=20,2.6920000000000006,2.6920000000000006,2.6920000000000006,2.6920000000000006,2.6920000000000006
18,Christina D.,"Farmington, MI",33,19,65.0,4.0,2013-12-05,"So this red robin is nothing special. As the other servers are probably not making money it's understandable. They all have resting bitch face. As a person in the restaurant industry this location is a little off upon first sight. But, once you get past the ever so Obvious resting bitch face. You can start to enjoy your server I had Breeanna she was young and kind of goofy but it worked. This location has the worst rep but it's understandable the servers seem to be good but if no one is walking they are only making 2.65 which would make me a lil annoyed. I got the BBQ whiskey chicken wrap it was delicious. Just give this location a chance it isn't bad at all.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-detroit,,,,,
27,Mary R.,"Warrendale, Detroit, MI",0,1,,1.0,2014-01-19,"The food at any red robin is delicious, usually...here is soup would be considered water and the service was horrible!!!  I would never come come to THIS red robin again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-detroit?start=20,,,,,
22,Jayla A.,"Sandusky, OH",0,7,,2.0,2014-05-09,We went to this red robin to have a night out to eat. We walked in and we were greeted. Once we were seated. It took 15 min for the waitress to come over. We asked a few questions about the menu that she did not know the answer to so a coworker came to answer them. My friend ordered a drink which she never got but was charged for. Our buns were burnt and service was extremely slow. The waiter had an attitude with us. I think ill be going to the other red robin restaurants.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-detroit?start=20,,,,,
24,Andrea J.,"Kalamazoo, MI",3,46,,2.0,2014-06-29,"good food, awful service.  I haven't been to a Red Robin in ages, but i have happy memories of them from when I was a teenager. I had a hankering for a burger, fries, and beer, so Red Robin seemed like a good idea.   Not this one.  Took a while for a hostess to greet me (this after a handful of employees walked right past me and studiously did not make eye contact), I was seated a booth with dirty seats in the bar, and was told the bartender would be helping me. Bar seating was just fine for me, btw.  There were a few other tables in the, and maybe two people sitting at the bar.  The bartender was expected to service these parties, mix all the cocktails for the entire restaurant, and process to-go orders.  There were two other waitresses hanging out in the bar area, but they didn't help him one bit, nor did they make eye contact with any customers in the area.  When the bartender did take my order and bring my food he was friendly, but getting his attention later was nearly impossible.  I might be judging the slow service a little harshly because i was very hungry..... but there were not that many customers in the restaurants and a ton of staff wandering around doing nothing.    Next time I want a build-my-own-burger there's a good chance I'll have my eye out for a Red Robin.  Just not this one. Not ever this one, not ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-detroit?start=20,,,,,
14,Steve M.,"Studio City, CA",7,67,,4.0,2014-11-19,"It was snowing, I was cold, and the choice of food at my hotel wasn't the greatest. What to do? I'm sniffy about chain restaurants, but this place knocked it out of the park. Ghost chili and jalapeno burger, fries and a couple of beers, plus the bartender and my server, Traci, was a gem. Thanks! Fed, happy and back to LA sunshine tomorrow!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-detroit,,,,,
20,Adam H.,"Detroit, MI",1,6,9.0,2.0,2014-12-17,Me and my ol lady went to red robin one night when we first walk in we were greeted at the door & shown to our seats right away after that the night just got worse our drinks were watered down they took for ever to take our order and even longer to make it my clam strips were extremely salty my burger was under cooked my ol lady Fish and chips was rubbery and very wet for some reason the waitress act like she had an attitude and was gone for a long time then when she came back and asked how is everything? she seemed like she was high and smelled of marijuana no wonder we got such poor service and food. seems to me the only good service you get at Red Robin is when you first walk in the door and are about to leave everyone standing near the door like they have nothing else better to do happy to greet you coming in and going out,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-detroit?start=20,,,,,

7,Scott M.,"Canton, MI",122,190,41.0,4.0,2015-02-18,"I went here for a Quidditch Team outing. Everyone left happy. The food was good. I had the Patty Melt. I devoured that whole thing in 6 bites because it was so yummy and delicious. They always made sure everyone had fries, all the time.  The service was awesome. We had 20 people come in at 8 p.m. and they were kind, caring, and gracious. The food came out so fast for everyone too. The management here runs a damn good ship. Keep up the great work. Also - Red Robin's Fish and Chips, very under-rated. Their Tarter sauce is soooo good. I think next time I roll here, I'm getting the burger with the egg on it. It looked so good and everyone who ordered it, destroyed all of it. Must have been good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-detroit,,,,,
10,Erik B.,"Dearborn, MI",0,1,,2.0,2015-03-04,"I love a good burger, like any American. Service was horrible.  Only thing that was done right was being greeted at the door. Took 15 minutes before a waitress came over to take our drink order, and the only reason she did was because we got up and asked for a server. I ordered a gourmet (not) burger. Wife ordered fish. The bun on the burger was old and stale and the food itself was warm, not hot. My wife's fish wasn't cooked thoroughly. Waitress said I will have them take it off the bill...after we had been there for almost 45 minutes. I could understand if the place was busy, but it wasn't. As far as I am concerned, her drink and soup should have been comp'd as well.  This restaurant needs to hire some competent staff and train them. They make the chain look horrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-detroit,,,,,

19,Craig M.,"Detroit, MI",0,6,,1.0,2016-03-26,"I ordered carryout when this location first opened. The staff was extremely rude and my order was incomplete. Instead of correcting it, they went on to tell me I was wrong. So, last night I decided after years of being open, they might have improved. This was not the case. I ordered carryout, again. My fiance ordered a burger medium well. There was blood on her buns and in the carryout case. The egg on her burger was burnt. My fish, shrimp, and clams were soggy even though I was there to pick up my order 5 minutes before being told to. Our desert was an absolute joke. We got the donuts and they literally put them in a used box that had French fries and salt in the bottom. Again, the staff was rude, uninviting, and just downright depressing.

The service is pretty standard; friendly but sometimes a little slow for my liking.  The food is good with a nice selection of specialty burgers with clever topping choices. You can substitute a chicken patty or veggie burger if you so desire. Nice apps and desserts, a full bar menu, dessert options and shakes; even a beer shake! The signature blend seasoning on every table adds a extra touch. We went for non-burger selections with the fish and chips and Ensenada chicken platter. The bottomless sides (we chose garlic parm fries and steamed broccoli) are a nice plus.  The atmosphere is buzzing with voices and laughter. It's a great place for kids with brightly colored decor, fun art and a small arcade.

Patrick took care of all of us in a friendly & bubbly way. He knew what we needed before we asked for it and made sure our dining experience was a good one.
