17,Tristan B.,"Bloomington, IL",20,92,25.0,5.0,2012-02-01,"I despise chain restaurants. Red Robin, Apple Bees, Chili's, TGI Fridays, etc are the restaurant versions of hell to me. I also coach a college mock trial team that requires me to travel with 15 college students on a regular basis. College students are cheap and picky eaters. Thus we always end up eating at chain restaurants. During the Lora's tournament we went to this Red Robin for dinner.  Normally when 17 people walk into a restaurant without a reservation you can expect at least a 30 minute wait in addition to a look of sheer terror/hatred by the wait staff. This Red Robin sat us all together in under 15 minutes. Our servers (they got us multiple servers to speed things up) were all very pleasant and smiled the entire time. They didn't even groan when our party of 17 asked for separate checks.  The food came out quickly and was standard Red Robin fare. Fries were good. Burgers were okay. It was somewhat off putting that your choice for a burger was between ""some pink"" and ""no pink"". I would hope a chef has more range than that. I would also hope our society could still handle the not so complex rare - well done scale that's worked for many years. Not having a lot of faith in the chef I opted for ""no pink"" and yet the burger wasn't charcoal when it came out.  The head coach downs lemonade like he needs it to survive. In an average dinner he'll go through at least 6. I don't want to brag, but I can also knock back the iced tea on occasion. Both of us were impressed at how quickly our drinks were refilled. We actually on more than one occasion we were impressed by how they brought us a new drink before we'd even finished the previous. Even servers who weren't watching our section would bring us drinks. I found this out when two iced teas showed up for me at the same time.  They did had a 19% gratuity to our checks, but included the option to increase or decrease it as we saw fit.  If I wasn't with my mock trial students would I eat here? No. But for what it is and the purpose it serves, this Red Robin was fantastic and gets 5 stars from me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dubuque,,,,,

15,Alyssa K.,"Lindenhurst, IL",84,294,67.0,5.0,2014-01-13,"This is one of my brother's favorite places to eat so when we were all home for Christmas we had to go there. Wait time was almost 20 minutes but since there was an open table in the bar area and we were all of age we we snagged that table instead.   Our server was great.  He made sure to check back on us and fill up our drinks when we needed. The food was delicious.  I ordered the Burnin' Love burger and it was mild on the spiciness scale for me.  A little bit of a kick, but I didn't even break a sweat.  Some of my dining partners decided to order another basket of fries since they are bottomless.  Even though the restaurant was busy, the fries didn't take too long.  I did get to try some of my mom's sweet potato fries and I think Red Robin does a good job with these.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dubuque,,,,,
13,Lisa L.,"Manchester, IA",201,96,31.0,4.0,2014-06-11,"Pleasantly surprised! I don't normally frequent chain restaurants but we were in the area, tight on time and my mother wanted a burger.   We arrived mid-afternoon so the place was slow and we were seated promptly.  the host was decent enough to stow my mom's walker, which was a kind gesture.  Our server Sara was sweet and perky, but not too much so, and her timing was great.  She even gave my mom a little extra peach shake.  They probably do that for everyone but it made her feel special and that makes me happy. Burgers were prepared perfectly and as requested.  I love the literal bottomless steak fry serving vehicle which held piping hot fries that were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.   My only minor complaint is paying $2.79 for a glass of iced tea. When compared to the peach shake, which was $3.99 and is maybe just slightly overpriced, something seems amiss with the iced tea price. But yeah, I recommend this place and would eat there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dubuque,,,,,
12,Ray R.,"Delaware, OH",91,221,9.0,4.0,2014-10-08,"Whenever I come to Dubuque, I purchase lunch for my students.  I give them a choice of two restaurants here in Dubuque, and this one is very popular amongst the students. The food is always fresh and good.  The staff have always been friendly and attentive.  The restaurant has always been clean. I always try something different each time I eat here and so far, everything has been good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dubuque,,,,,
18,Caitlin R.,"Dubuque, IA",5,1,,3.0,2014-11-12,"At our latest visit,  the food was wonderful but the service was awful!  Our waitress was on top of getting drinks but nothing else. Our salad came at the same times as the meal and we had to flag her down for silverware to eat it.  Also, the bottomless fries are hard to get refills on.  This seems to be common with the service here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dubuque,,,,,
14,Mary S.,"Dubuque, IA",2,83,43.0,2.0,2014-11-29,"Pitifully slow tonight. It only took 15 min to get seated but after ordering, it took over 30 min for the food to get to our table. The server came back 3 times, before the order came, to refill drinks. There were empty tables so it wasn't overly busy. The fries were not cooked all the way. Crispy on the outside but somewhat raw inside. I did enjoy my chicken tortilla soup. While the food is good, once you get it, the prices are high for what you get. There aren't many choices for good sit down restaurants in the area. It seems like it's getting longer and longer wait times for food. We've all been done eating and are still waiting for the bill to come. It's unfortunate that we are having this experience this time. Hopefully it will improve.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dubuque,,,,,

11,Jeff N.,"Knierim, IA",0,1,,1.0,2015-09-05,"Have not been to a Red Robin in a while, so we stopped at the one in Dubuque, Iowa.  Big mistake, waited 15 minutes as you would in any restaurant, which was fine.  We were seated and then waited for about 15 minutes with a light flashing on the kiosk. No body showed up to check on us.  People where seated after us in the next booth had their drinks and ordered. I could not get a workers attention, we got up and left.  I stopped at the host station asked what they hell, they asked what table then stammered about.  I just announced to everyone else that was waiting, I hope they have better service than we did and then walked out.  We drove to Appleby's down the road which was just as busy, was seated and ordered within 10 minutes from walking in the door.  Avoid Red Robin in Dubuque, I know I will.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dubuque,,,,,
8,Danielle S.,"Scales Mound, IL",16,62,14.0,4.0,2016-01-09,"My bf and I stopped in here before we went to the movies to see Star Wars. I see commercials for Red Robin all the time where I live (New Orleans)  but the closest one is almost an hour away so I was excited to try them. My bf got the double bacon pig thingy burger with garlic parmesan fries and I got the single bacon cheeseburger with garlic parmesan fries. Now, I know that they have endless fries but they don't give you much to begin with and I think I tasted garlic on only maybe a few of the fries. The burger was cooked to perfection and was pretty darn good but I was disappointed in the fries though but still all in all, a good experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dubuque,,,,,
10,Jesse G.,"Dubuque, IA",52,105,66.0,3.0,2016-02-15,"The place has made some improvements in the service since I had originally written the review.  On subsequent visits the service was much better than our February 2016 visit where the food took a while to show up, and some stuff never did.  And the self service pay station worked much better on subsequent visits.  I'm taking that problematic visit into account so that's why I rated it three starts now.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dubuque,,,,,
7,Tracey J.,"Dubuque, IA",8,15,,4.0,2016-06-11,This was my first visit to Red Robin! I was very happy with the staff and service! My wife loved her burger that had bacon jam on it! I had the shroom burger and it was good! The fries were great the garlic flavored ones were extra yummy. I was not terribly impressed with the fried pickles or the fried broccoli. The pickles needed more pickle - all you tasted was the batter and grease. The broccoli was ok but I think over cooked. The salted caramel shake was yummy. Had a bit of sticker shock when the bill came. We had 20% off with the online app/club. Yet we still spent $50.00. Overall the place was good and I do want to try some of the adult desert drinks they have to offer - just need a designatec driver!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dubuque,,,,,
6,K S.,"Dubuque, IA",18,204,764.0,5.0,2016-07-23,"Had my first meal here the day it opened since the Red Robin has become a Dubuque favorite. Plenty of great burger options. 8, 6, or 4 ounce options. The bottomless fries are a great treat. I sprinkle mine with the signature blend seasoning. I prefer the tavern burgers with two patties.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dubuque,,,,,

4,Karen B.,"Asbury, IA",0,9,,2.0,2017-03-22,"The food is good, however we haven't had very good service here. Whether to get a refill on a drink or more fries, it seems as though you are waiting a while. Their bottomless fries sound like a good deal, but they only bring out 10 french fries at one time and then you end up waiting a very long time before you can get 10 more.  We ended up ordering our desert on the tablet because we hadn't seen a waitress in a while. The multiple times we have been here they have not been very good/prompt about service in general.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dubuque,,,,,

0,Jon H.,"Dubuque, IA",30,39,,4.0,2017-08-12,"Haven't been to RR in quite a few years. Burgers are still good. Friendly wait staff. The only suggestion I have to give is if you order the sweet potato fries, order with lite or no salt. The first batch I got I couldn't even eat.  The waitress was nice and got me a new order. Way better.  Outside that, a pretty good experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dubuque,,,,,

2,Dennis K.,"Potosi, WI",0,18,,2.0,2017-11-05,"The food was great, the service was horrible. No one greeted us when we arrived. The host just walked away.  When a manager walked by she told a waiter to seat us.  There were a lot of dirty tables, and we changed our choice of tables because of all the mess on the floor. Our waitress was terribly slow, never came back to see if everything was ok, didn't ask if we wanted refills on drinks or bottomless fries until we were all done. And then had to wait a long time to get a bill. Definitely needs some employee changes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-dubuque,,,,,
