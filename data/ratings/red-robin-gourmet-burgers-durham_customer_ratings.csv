The real testament to Red Robin is that it's a family-friendly place with tons of kids around, and I *still* want to go. At this particular location, I've sat at the bar, at a table in the bar area, and in the main seating area a couple times as well. The main dining area might have more kids, but the bar area can be kind of tight. Take your pick. On one visit, the host sat us right next to the bathroom and we could smell something foul from our table. Luckily, they weren't busy (so someone should be free to freshen up the bathroom, no?), and we moved booths without a problem. Our server was very understanding and apologetic. I almost always get a Banzai burger (grilled pineapple, FTW), but will enjoy the occasional California chicken sandwich plus some golden, crispy bottomless fries. And if you're really hungry, get the fried mushrooms. It's cool--they're vegetables.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-durham,3.184,3.184,3.184,3.184,3.184
31,Lauren P.,"Bailey, CO",123,200,161.0,4.0,2013-02-17,"I'm a fan of Red Robin because Red Robin has gluten free buns for their burgers. No more am I resolved to eating a naked, bunless burger. Here, at Red Robin I am able to enjoy holding and caressing my medium rare burger as it falls apart into the abyss that is my mouth. No, seriously, it's a good bun, but that thing falls apart in a heartbeat. They've got some other main meals that are gluten free, but there's nothing particular else to call out about the menu. Pretty much everything is covered in flour and fried.  It is nice to know that the manager brings over your food if you mention the gluten free bun is because of an allergy. And it's doubly nice that the waiter sometimes remembers to call that point out if you do happen to order something else that has gluten in it. I've often noticed that restaurants forget to teach waitstaff that if someone says they have an allergy and then go order a common appetizer like ""jalapeno poppers"" they should say sometime. Then again, I'm not a waitress, so who knows? This particular location also has a nice outdoor seating area. It gets kind of shady in the late afternoon so it's definitely one of those good places to hit for an early dinner in the summer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-durham?start=20,3.152,3.152,3.152,3.152,3.152
50,Megan N.,"Durham, NC",4,24,1.0,5.0,2013-02-18,"You come here for burgers that are a step up from Only Burger. They are great, and the sweet potato fries for an extra dollar fifty are GREAT. I highly suggest splurging the extra buck fifty, because the normal fries are NOT GOOD. I tend to get the Banzai Burger- with cheddar cheese and pineapple, the Bleu Ribbon Burger, with bleu cheese and onion strips, or the Sauteed Shroom Burger, with SO MANY mushrooms.   If you get the shroom burger, put the Red Robin Seasoning on it, adds a great touch to a slightly bland burger. The price is, as expected, a bit higher than other places, but the quality makes up for it. Most of the servers are very friendly, but as expected a bit busy with the Friday night crowd.

For the Durham location: standard fare as far as Red Robins go.  If you haven't been in a couple years,  I'd give it a try.  We've had consistently good service (we go primarily for free birthday burgers these days), and it delivers when you want to eat a burger and dine out in a casual environment.

I loved their Chili Burger which was served open faced because you couldn't pick it up.  Now adays the Chili Burger is still the best thing on the menu with the possible exception of the Tower of Onion Rings. The steak fries are good and the fruity drinks are nice as well. The food is served in little plastic baskets which I find to be a little off putting but it masks the fact that the burgers are a little small and they fill up the rest of the tiny basket with fries.I usually enjoy my food, but beware it will hit you like a lead brick about 30 minutes after you leave,  The wait staff is awsome. We have never had to wait for refills, they normally just bring them out without you having to ask. The food is always fresh and hot even if I wished they would used different patties for the burgers.  Decent food.

40,AP L.,"Chapel Hill, NC",0,9,,2.0,2015-10-04,What happened to the service here?   It used to be decent and since they've rebranded it's just horrible.   We waited close to 10 minutes for our waiter to even come over to our table tonight for our initial order. Ordered appetizers but never received them - saw our waiter twice total  (and they weren't that busy).  We won't be back until they figure out their service issues.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-durham?start=40,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92
22,Gene K.,"San Jose, CA",0,1,,1.0,2015-11-01,Very disappointed.  Had to ask to be reseated because the chairs at the table we were offered were filthy.  After 15 minutes with no service we decided to leave.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-durham?start=20,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84

4,Elizabeth G.,"Fayetteville, NC",35,105,136.0,3.0,2016-01-28,I'm really not a fan of the change in decor. I preferred the previous atmosphere it was more fun and whimsical. The change seems more boring than upscale. Still can't beat their burgers although you can easily beat the price. $12.99 for the more specialized ones still seems like a bit much. Really like the freckled lemonade and the blue moon milkshake though.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-durham,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84
23,Nollie M.,"Chapel Hill, NC",0,6,,1.0,2016-04-30,We decided to give this particular red robin one more chance after our fiasco last visit where we were seated but waited 10 min before even having a drink order taken. And even then the manager had to be summoned to do so. This time we sat for 20 min without a server before having to go find a hostess to get us our drinks. Only some of the drinks were delivered. 20 minutes they were still making my daughters Oj at the bar apparently. 10 more min went by before a server came to take our order. I ordered a chicken sandwich with pepper jack cheese in a little wrap. It's on the menu. I got asked twice to verify my order because the cooks told the server what I ordered wasn't on the menu. Simply grilled chicken sandwich. Look it up. Apparently the pepper jack threw them off. It was ten min before the server came back to verify the order which meant my sandwich STILL had not been rung in. 45 minutes after arriving and food was just being sent through...do not come here if you hope to eat in any sort of timely manner. It won't happen. Oh and one star is only because it won't let me put 0,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-durham?start=20,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8
12,Chris E.,"Chapel Hill, NC",33,3,,5.0,2016-05-06,"I am always extremely pleased when I visit Red Robin. The servers are amazing, and the food is incredible.

21,S.J. B.,"Roswell, GA",0,5,,1.0,2016-06-13,"Don't waste your time here unless you have a LOT of time available to waste. Waited forever for food that was mediocre and cold. Service was very very slow and seemed eager to run from the table, rather than offer a solution. Getting my $1.50 returned for my cold onion rings was presented as generous....clearly could benefit from some basic service technique training....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-durham?start=20,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72
3,Brenda Y.,"Durham, NC",259,105,76.0,4.0,2016-09-18,"These burgers are delicious. Pair 'em up with bottomless steak fries (fresh & crispy), table-side seasoning (what's in that?!), honey mustard (dat synergy with the fries), and freckled lemonade and ohhhhh boy! The ""foodies"" I know tend to ignore chains, but good 'ol RR deserves a shout-out. This place and Dain's on 9th are in a deadheat for my burger heart. I also enjoyed being able to pay with a credit card from the tablet thing on the table. Fun & efficient.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-durham,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84

5,Steve S.,"Reidsville, NC",0,19,,2.0,2016-12-29,Waitress had a lot of trouble knowing beers and prices as well as what is/is not on tap. I told waitress to go ahead and bring me a second fry to save her a trip. She just smiled and left.  VERY SLOW. @ 15 minutes from seating to take order. After 22 minutes order came. Good taste but slapped together liked McDonald's. I asked for more fries and 10 minutes later and asking again I got more. Had to ask soft drink prices because they aren't listed. Finally settled for water. Oh well I guess I need to stick with Wendy's or the king.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-durham,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
8,David C.,"Durham, NC",0,7,1.0,1.0,2017-02-24,"Terribly slow and apathetic service.  Apparently our wait staff would rather talk amongst themselves than assist paying customers.  Glasses were filthy, table wasn't cleaned for us (crumbs and sauce all over it).  Salt and pepper shakers looked dirty as well with gunk and hair on it.  Management needs to rethink how to run the business appropriately.  They will not be having my business anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-durham,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
2,Roger K.,"Raleigh, NC",466,308,3692.0,4.0,2017-03-01,Red Robin is always good. Great food if you love hamburgers. I'm not a beef fan so I eat more chicken. Their menu doesn't have as many awesome chicken sandwiches but it's still good food. Love the bottomless fries! The bar isn't that bad either. The server that worked on my order was friendly and she made great suggestions. 4stars for Red Robin.
