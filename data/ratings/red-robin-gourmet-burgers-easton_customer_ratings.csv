24,Christopher C.,"Conshohocken, PA",168,1318,6419.0,3.0,2012-08-24,"Typical uneven all over the place chain dining where it's guaranteed that either the food or service will disappoint every time. The biggest issue yesterday during our lunch was our server. She was very, very slow and she was assigned apparently to cover tables in various sections of the Lehigh Valley. That plus total inattentiveness equaled taking an extra half an hour for something that should have been much quicker considering that we were there after the lunch rush. The food itself was as advertised in that it was chain quality average. Nothing great but at the same time nothing wrong either. After our food came our server ""K"" right on cue disappeared. Ask how our meal was?  No Drink refill for me?  No Drink refill for the children?  No Thank goodness that the A/C was barely on and that the place was rather hot because at least the ice in our drinks had melted enough so as to keep us hydrated less we may have expired from dehydration. But the best part was for last when after disappearing for over twenty minutes she brought me a big basket of fries while dropping off the check.  The problem was that I never said that I wanted more fries when instead obviously another beverage would have been awesome. Overall this RR is a great place if you are crazy hungry and don't care about how/when/if your food is delivered to you in a proper/timely manner. I'll bump the rating up a bit because the food was fine but the service here was flat out suck.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-easton?start=20,2.444,2.444,2.444,2.444,2.444

Most chains cannot do a burger, but Red Robins does it well. They have a new ordering system on your table which is unique, however, I feel maybe unnecessary for a chain such as Red Robins.

I do just want to say that I tried the Ghost Fury Tavern Burger, and it was HOT. And this is coming from someone who puts hot sauce on everything. It was too hot for me. I actually had to take the jalapeños off, because that combing with the ghost pepper sauce was simply too much. But all in all, I'd still tell anyone to go there, since it's really great food and good service. The computers at the table are also really great.

But I recently went and the service wasn't that great. Our waitress didn't take dirty plates off the table, didn't notice when we needed drink refills. I wasn't even halfway done with my burger yet when she came over and asked if we're paying with cash or credit, and then proceeded to open the check up on the ziosk. She didn't bother coming back after that to get plates, or more drinks, didn't even ask if we wanted to have dessert. She was rushing us out the door and we weren't even done eating yet.

My date ordered a raspberry cream soda and I a strawberry milkshake which were enjoyable and refreshing. The drink menu features many of the latest mixology trends like beer milkshakes and cocktails. My date and I got nachos as an appetizer - the portion was large and the chili sauce tasty. For an entree, I got the Blue Ribbon burger which wasn't overly messy or overcooked. My date ordered the guacamole burger and enjoyed it. We both liked the fries (we only got one portion each). It was a busy Saturday, but our food came out quickly and the server was attentive. It was very loud in the building; large groups with kids took up most of the seating. And of course, the usual chain-style birthday celebrations were taking place. The table-side kiosk allows for quick ordering and payment.

I was not even eating fried chicken.  My fries were cold, which I believe should never be the case, considering that's probably the item they make the most of. The clam chowder looked terrible and was barely warm.  My other girlfriend ordered a wrap and whatever came in it,was not what it said on the menu.... I've been in the food service industry for 15 years and I've never complained once.. but this really got to me.  Everything about the place was wrong.  Definitely not a place I'll be coming back to ever again.... funny thing is, I've worked in this location before and I've never seen it this bad.... the staff,including wait, management and kitchen, must all be new.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-easton?start=20,2.084,2.084,2.084,2.084,2.0840000000000005

Ketchup & salt bottles were empty at our table we had to fetch our own from another table, she didn't even notice. Black & blue burger was just ok almost tasted like meatloaf w/ a sparce amount of blue cheese served with a very small pile of Luke warm French fries.

They were so burnt black that what was remaining of the hotdogs inside the charred cornmeal were peeling apart inside!  How they allowed them to service anyone those corn dogs is beyond me!  Of course we called our manager over again.  He was again apologetic and had new ones made up again.  We didn't bother telling him that one was supposed to be chicken tenders!  Our waitress was so slow that we ran out of drinks constantly and she was no where to be seen.  We almost jumped up and filled our own glasses since the drink station was right there.  Figured that would be frowned upon.  Well, we got our almost warm spinach/artichoke mush and the three kids meal disasters for free, but it was definitely not worth going, even though we fed the entire family for $30.  (So not worth it!).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-easton,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84
21,Michael A.,"Allentown, PA",0,6,2.0,1.0,2016-09-24,I went to this Red Robin on Saturday 9/24 at around 3PM. I ordered the Chicken and Waffle sandwich. It took about 25 minutes and the place was not packed whatsoever. When I did get my sandwich I had about 10 fries (Bottomless??) and my waffles were frozen. I settled for a different bun for my chicken because I was so hungry. You would have thought the manager would have let me have that sandwich on the house since I literally ate chicken and bread with a measly 10 French fries instead of what I actually ordered. Instead he wouldn't come over to meet me and told the waitress he would take 2 dollars off my meal. 2 dollars?? I didn't even finish my meal because it was gross.

I can attest to the other reviews that the front had a few high school aged workers lounging around. The poor rating, for me, comes from the food. My significant other and I ordered one of the gourmet burgers and the grilled cheese melt. After waiting over 30 minutes for the items on a seemingly dead Sunday afternoon, our food arrived. The grilled cheese melt contained neither the grilled or melt part, just cheese. A few slices of different cheeses that were warm, at best, between two slices of slightly toasted bread. The burger was luke  warm and fairly rare when it was ordered medium well. It bared no resemblance to what was described on the menu. Neither of us finished our meals.

Ordered their version of a French Dip, The Prime Rib Dip, and it was very disappointing. The entire sandwich was only 5-6 inches long and there was no more than 2 thin layers of beef. This in and of itself was disappointing for the $15 price tag but even more so was the COMPLETE lack of flavor and seasoning both in the beef AND in the au jus.  If you've ever eaten when you had a cold and couldn't really taste anything, that was the experience with this sandwich. I thought it must be me so I asked my daughter to taste it and she said the exact same thing, ""it has NO flavor!""

But this place disappoints; you place your own appetizer order and pay at the table, again yourself with a table top computer/IPad hybrid thing. First you have to separate the check if you need to- that is not an option when ordering now. The server sort of gets dumbed down to a retriever- silverware when they forget it, salad dressing when they forget it, sauces and sides when they forget it... The theme is- the server is not really trained for customer service here. I feel like servers should be trained well so they can be tipped well for full service.  Food?

1,Joujou N.,"Brooklyn, NY",24,179,402.0,2.0,2018-01-11,Their service was  5 stars.  Our waitress was super helpful and informative. The food. Ughhhhhhhhhh It was horrible. Soooo bad. How can you mess up pretzel bites? They tasted like they were frozen and reheated in the microwave. Soggy exterior and dry inside. And the cheese dip-blahhhh-lumpy and salty. The burger was all greasy and the chicken teriyaki wrap was dry. The potatoe soup was super salty.  I think the only thing that was half way decent was the steak fries-probably because I requested them not to have them salted.  1st and last time I ever set foot at a Red Robin. The food quality is bad and unhealthy. Also pricey compared to other places in the area.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-easton,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
2,Ross B.,"Parsippany, Parsippany, NJ",0,4,,1.0,2018-01-14,"Based on parking, I thought there would be a long wait, however we were seated immediately... at a dirty table with enough spot lights on it I thought I was part of a display.  15 min after seating we still haven't seen a waitress. One table is waiting for her to show up so they can leave. One table has ordered based on the lack of menus on their table but still no drinks on their table and there before us. The next table near us had something wrong with their food. Manager looked more like the dishwasher and less like a supervisor. Finally get table wiped off and order drink and another 15 goes by still no drinks. We left.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-easton,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
