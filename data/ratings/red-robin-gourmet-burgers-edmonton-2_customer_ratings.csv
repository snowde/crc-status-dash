34,Violet P.,"Edmonton, Canada",109,952,429.0,4.0,2012-03-04,"You can almost never go wrong with Red Robin for burgers.  There is a such a variety from beef, lamb, chicken, fish, and turkey burgers.  Even if you aren't in the mood for a burger they also have salads, wraps, and chicken fingers. We called to make a reservation for 5:30 on a Friday and luckily they were able to accommodate us but it could have been that we were celebrating a bday.  That's a good tip for next time, even if the bday is months away. The layout of this RR is open and there were lots of families with young children.  It gets noisy but I wasn't annoying.  Our waitress for friendly and attentive which was good for a busy evening.  We had the towering onions rings, it's worth sharing if you have 4 people and we all enjoyed our burgers and steak fries. If you sign up for their birthday club, you get a coupon for a free burger.  Since they knew it was my sister's birthday from the coupon, they even sang her a bday song and gave her a free dessert. While this location is not my favourite, the food and service were good enough to go back if I'm in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edmonton-2?start=20,2.544,2.544,2.544,2.544,2.544

38,Bethany M.,"Edmonton, Canada",49,260,81.0,4.0,2013-03-26,"I haven't been to a Red Robin in years, but we are considering them for our (very casual) rehearsal dinner, so we stopped in last week. First off, anywhere that has pretzel bites with beer and cheese dip can't be bad. I would go back for this appetizer alone. it was delicious. The pretzel bites were hot and soft and the dip was cheezy and had just a hint of beer flavor.  My fiances burger was good, as was my beef dip. The Au Jus actually had some onion flavor to it. One thing I would change was the onion straws. They needed to be crispier. Aside from that, the service was good, and we will definitely be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edmonton-2?start=20,2.352,2.352,2.352,2.352,2.352
19,Kristin K.,"Edmonton, Canada",518,1215,7576.0,4.0,2013-07-20,"My family has been coming to this location since they opened up.  The quality is consistent and the service is friendly. I've probably eaten here a good couple dozen times or so between family gatherings, friend's birthdays, or lunch out with co-workers. The prices are fair and the quality is good.  I think Ive only ever had to send something back once - so that's pretty good in my books! If it's your birthday and you like to be embarrassed, they will sing you a song and give you a scoop of ice cream. Their mile high mud pie is definitely a shareable dessert but not as good as many others in town (props goes to Original Joe's for this particular item). There are coupons on the SUTP book and Entertainment book every year for free towering onion rings or $5 off two entrees if you like to save a few bucks. They have helium balloons for kiddos and a decent size bar area if you come with only adults so you can skip waiting for a table in the family section on a busy night. Highlights for me include the Mediterranean Chicken Burger with  tzatziki and feta on a ciabatta bun - My go to!  The Bonzai Chicken Burger with teriyaki sauce and a pineapple ring is my 2nd favorite chicken item on the menu. Hubby loves the Whiskey River BBQ burger as well as whatever promo spicy item they have at the time. They offer kid meals with a fair selection and have a decent drink selection, too.  The strawberry freckled lemonade has real strawberries in it and comes with unlimited refills.  The adult version doesn't come with refills for obvious reasons :-) One thing I don't like about this location is the bathroom always seem to have an overflowing garbage, missing paper towels, or on my most recent visit this past week - a missing stall door.   So overall, Red Robin gets 4 our of 5 stars for me and they keep me coming back... PS I've uploaded lots of pics over time so take a gander!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edmonton-2,2.288,2.288,2.288,2.288,2.2880000000000003
37,Dave C.,"Edmonton, Canada",48,153,11.0,4.0,2013-08-25,"This is one of the best places if you're craving a delicious burger. I haven't had anything else on the menu, because the burgers are just so good. You get bottomless steak fries with your burger, however it's pretty hard to finish the plate you start with. If you have a big appetite it might be something you could actually take advantage of though.  The milkshakes are good too. Service is usually pretty quick and friendly. Definitely a family atmosphere.

36,Monique M.,"Edmonton, Canada",196,91,510.0,2.0,2013-08-28,"We don't usually go to Red Robin's for dessert but a friend wanted to meet there so we agreed. Our foursome ordered 1 Mile High Mud pie, a Lava Cake, and two Apple Crumble.  The lava cake was the usual small upside down cake with melted chocolate inside small cake. Nothing to write home about. The mud pie was indeed mile high. My friend was very happy with her layered ice cream, mousse, peanut butter, Oreo choice. The apple crumble on the other hand was a bust. Mine arrived in a sea of watery mess. When I pointed this out to the waitress, she said, ""oh, that's the caramel sauce."" When I pointed out that my husband's crumble was not watery, she said ""oh, your ice cream melted"". When I pointed out that the scoop of ice cream was actually still intact, she finally offered to bring me another one. Wish I had just ordered the mile high... The apples used were of the frozen variety which explains why it was so watery. Both crumbles were bland in flavour and the apples had a foamy water soaked texture. The only good part was the oatmeal cookie crumble and vanilla ice cream.  Dessert at Red Robins' ? Stick to what they do best...

I've stuck to the salad options here, since they have loads of toppings and I can barely make it through the whole thing. Hubby loves the burgers here, not only are they massive and accompanied by endless fries, they're a great value.

35,Karlie M.,"Edmonton, Canada",201,412,308.0,4.0,2013-12-11,"Yummmmmmm, I am seriously addicted to the burgers here. They certainly aren't 'gourmet' as some people would consider the word, but there are a lot of scrumptious options to choose from. I've tried several of them, and they are all delicious, juicy and super filling. And come with unlimited fries! There are chicken burgers and veggie burgers, but why bother? I've always wanted to order one of those towers of onion rings that are always sailing past... The milkshakes are really good, too. Prices are very reasonable, usually around $12 for the burger + unlimited fries. Nothing not to like about that.  This is definitely a family friendly restaurant, and as I don't have any kids and don't like waiting for a spot in the dining room, I always sit in the lounge. There are many TVs playing sports all around. I was there last night and they must have been playing a combo of Dance Mix '96 and the Night At The Roxbury soundtrack. Loudly. It was amazing. You're pretty much guaranteed to hear Happy Birthday from the other side of the restaurant every time you come here. Most of the staff are usually really young to pretty young. Waitresses and hostesses are always cheerleader upbeat, and waiters are always goofy and friendly.

We were told the kitchen was ""backed up"" and that they were short staffed (meanwhile, people who came in AFTER us received and finished their meals).

3,Mary G.,"Lancaster Park, Canada",0,13,,2.0,2015-02-18,"It took a while for me to come back here and update but the Management contacted us and offered a $50 gift certificate to hopefully rectify our experience. The review was not given on the hopes of free stuff but we went anyway and unfortunately did not get much better service the second time.we purposely did not tell the staff we had a promotional card so that we could objectively experience the restaurant. The manager was very very confident that her people were delivering better service than we had previously experienced so we wanted to eat with an open mind. The server was nice enough but did not listen to us at all. We have a young child so requested his meal come out at the same time our appetizers came because he eats slowly. However, instead the server chose to bring the child's food then wait about 15 min then bring ALL our food at the same time. This resulted in stone cold appys and warm entrees and a lot of plates on the table. When we asked what was going on, he claimed he decided we needed all our food because the child was eating too fast. So without consulting us, he denied us a leisurely enjoyment of the appys and then move on to our entrees. My hubby also ordered coffee which was grey and old. He sent it back and the server, rather than offer to make a fresh cup, shared with us that most people send the coffee back.   After talking to a floor person there, we ended up being comped our appys, so we ended up with a credit on the gift card. It will remain as we have no desire to go back. I did notify the manager that we would not be back. I think she has an inflated opinion of her staff that is not being realized on the restaurant floor. My original complaint was to connect with management to ensure consistency between franchises and to date, that does not seem to happening, at least in our experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edmonton-2?start=40,1.576,1.576,1.576,1.576,1.576

I decided to give them another chance and went for dinner with a friend and her 3 kids.  We were seated quickly since it was lunch time and they were not busy yet.  We then were approached by 2 different waiters saying they were going to be helping us out which was a bit confusing.  We received our drinks but were not given any straws.  We asked and waited for 15 minutes for a straw.  In the mean time tables that had come in after we had ordered were now receiving their appetizers.  The same thing that we had ordered (tower of onion rings).  Still no appetizer but now my meal had come out but not the rest of the tables meals and the order was not right.  When asked they just brought out the appetizer but left my meal.  All 3 kids meals had the wrong side item.  Overall not really pleased and remember when I said we had 2 servers saying they were going to help, well now we couldn't get any one to our table.  They offer bottomless drinks and fries but there was no offer for this.  When I finally got the attention of another server they went and got the manager, Melvin.  Melvin then started to give me all the excuses as to why our meal was messed up.  While doing this he was grinning and laughing and I was left wondering what was funny.  It was our waiters first day, they are really busy, they are working in rebuilding the Clareview location.  You know what, I don't care.  What I wanted was an apology for the poor service but that was not going to happen any time soon.  They finally fixed all the orders and we were left to eat our meals.  At this point you would think that they would check how the meal was or offer a drink refill but that never happened.  I decided that I wanted to talk to Melvin again and express my displeasure with the service.  I told him that I did not understand why he was smirking and that all I really wanted was an apology.  He then credited my meal and gave my friend and I both a gift card for $25 to give them another chance.  Thanked him for that but told him that it was an apology I wanted.  He insisted we take the cards so we did.   Today we went to Red Robins in Sherwood Park.  Service and meal were great and we go to use the $25 gift cards and are told that they are only loaded with 25 cents.  That is fine not there fault but I did go back to Clareview location and talked to Melvin who then through the Sherwood Park location under the bus saying that they do not know how to do gift cards.

24,Tracy A.,"St Albert, Canada",83,11,6.0,1.0,2015-08-23,"So I recently visited Red Robins on 137th street again after my prior horrific visit.  Sadly, no improvement ... In fact it was worse!! New management & all ...  You kno you wouldn't think ordering a bowl of soup would be a daunting task .. But this particular day it sure was.  My son & I went for lunch, he's dieting so he ordered the blackened chicken sandwich with a lettuce wrap & broccoli .. His was fairly decent he said.  I ordered their main soup that they serve daily, The baked potato soup.  Now the description says it has shredded cheese & sour cream on top, sounds amazing! So I ordered it. Well it came & I took one bite & was horrified. It was like water & had no flavour at all. It actually tasted like water.  So immediately I said to the waitress that it was awful & she took it away & asked if I'd like the feature soup which was ""corn chowder"" .. I said ok.  The waitress returned and told me that the manager had said that that was what the soup was supposed to taste like!!!!!  Hmm .. I said, horrible? Like seriously????  So I waited ....  The waitress returns and gives me a bowl of what looks like chili with corn in it & a bunch of tortilla strips on top.  I looked @ the soup, then tried it. It was quite spicy .. Which I can't tolerate at all & it sure wasn't ""corn chowder""!!!!  So again I call the waitress back, and I say to her that this is Not corn chowder At all!  Now the ladies across from me are both nodding in agreement that this soup is definitely Not a corn chowder.  The waitress says that she will return with the manager.  Wow..... Now was this an experience.  The manager comes over & in a very condescending manner proceeds to tell that this indeed IS corn chowder ma'am and implies that I'm not real smart cuz this is surely corn chowder.   Hmm ... Well I said it's Not corn chowder .. It's sum kinda chili .. It's full of beans & has some corn in it & its spiced Mexican so I'm pretty sure it's a chili of some kind... Maybe Red Robins needs to look up the definition of ""chowder"" ... Better yet I think they all need to take a frickin course in how to make soup in general!!!!  Geeeeez!  So the manager proceeds to tell me that she's taken over this restaurant to try & fix what was wrong here before... Well sadly she's made it worse, in my opinion. At least before the food was still good. Now there really isn't a reason to go back.  The manager did cover my lunch but I didn't eat anything so it was no deal that's for sure.  I said ""Good luck"" to the ladies across from me as we left & the one lady turned to me & said, ""I'm scared""!!!  Yup....

Our drinks were never filled without waving her down, our very basic orders were wrong (after waiting an hour), waited another 20 mins and all of our burgers were burned to a crisp, waited another 20 minutes for this to be corrected before canceling it all together, talked to the assistant manager and he said he would deal with it, waited another 15 minutes for him to come back, waited another 10 minutes before going to track down our server to get our bills, we ended up only paying for our drinks but she tried to keep our change, so after 20 minutes we had to ask 3 different servers and 2 assistant managers to finally get our change.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edmonton-2?start=20,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08

Despite there obviously being many empty tables, we joined several other families being made to wait 10-15 minutes. Perhaps they had just openned...but shouldn't the setup be done beforehand?? Waited about 10 minutes for our server to show. She wasfriendly and helpfull. We told her we werd in a rush and she seemed to do what was in her power to assist. Kids had pasta with apples, and a meatball-pop dish. They were both happy with their choics and I heard no complaints while they cleaned their plates. I tried; The D.G.B. Oven-roasted tomatoes, roasted garlic aioli, arugula tossed in citrus olive oil dressing, on a toasted ciabatta bun. (Sorry...copy and pasted that from their website) I can't deceifer where the name comes from or what it means...but it sounded good... It was...alas...OK. Meat was pretty dry,, and bun was pretty heavy. I actually enjoyed my side of poutine better than my burger. When I lived in Clareview, I ate here many times.

15,Tara B.,"Lac la Biche, Canada",67,151,197.0,2.0,2016-04-02,"Meh The restaurant seemed dated, dirty. Staff less than enthusiastic. We waited for 10 min for a table while front staff had a huddle. Seriously. Lots of empty tables. Seat us, give us drinks then huddle.  Guy came out of kitchen with his hand right up his shirt scratching his back. Like shirt up, ginch band showing, just scratching away. Then he took off his hat and scratched his head. Mmm if he's a line cook I'm gonna puke! Steak fries, dry! Bland! Cold. Undercooked.  I had Bruschetta chicken burger in lettuce wrap. It was fine. I just hope itchy and scratchy didn't have his hands on it.  My teens had arctic cod and fries. Came with 4 decent sized pieces. They were happy! Said it was tasty. They put so much tartar sauce and ketchup on their meal they had no complaints of dry fries.  Hubby had some avocado burger. He liked it. He'll eat anything though.  Little girls had kid pizzas. Looked like a freaking freezer pizza from a toaster oven after school. But whatever I didn't expect much there. They didn't complain. But honestly how hard is it to make a little pizza from scratch. Kick it up a notch Red Robin.  Meal was $75 for family of 6. Decent price. It filled our gut. But I wouldn't go back.  Oh our server was great! Manager came by asked if we needed anything. That was good service too.  Meh. ***** UPDATED REVIEW***** So I was contacted from this restaurant. They assured me they take negative reviews seriously and wanted to make things right for me. He mentioned ""the scratching"" (my words) employee no longer works for them.  Offered to take care of us next time we were in. Nice follow up. Doesn't change my review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edmonton-2,1.84,1.84,1.84,,1.8400000000000003

Granted it was busy, but to find out before you had your order delivered to your table your server disappeared and went home. It was about 45 minutes before we received our dinner.  Good thing we ordered popcorn shrimp as an appie. If you're a server it's a good idea to tell your table you're going home and transferring the table to someone else. No refills. No checking in on how the food was or if we wanted more fries, no asking if we wanted dessert, just drop the bill off and go.

Hit up this joint with my 14-going-on-20 year old niece.   Red Robins has been around for a long time now and it's always a relatively fun experience but the years are beginning to show. The Decor is starting to look more dated then the retro. The menu is pretty substantial so choosing a meal can be a bit of a challenge especially when you don't know what you want. Both me and my niece ordered off the tavern menu as the prices we 3-4$ cheaper then items on the regular menu. I order the Smoky jack tavern burger. I was pretty good. The BBQ sauce was a bit overpowering of the other ingredients on the burger but satisfying non the less. My niece order the red tavern double. Which is your basic cheese burger. She's a bit of a picky eater and had all the condiments and lettuce and tomato ordered to be on the side. The waitress was happy to oblige no questions asked. Our order came hot and relatively quickly. Fries as usual were fat, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. On a side I happened to come in with a full bladder so immediately headed to the bathroom. Unfortunately the stall I choose was out of TP. Big fail. Huge fail. I was not a happy customer. It was only 1130 and they are already out. How does this happen. The bathroom was in decent shape but one of the hand towel machines was also out of paper. Sigh.
