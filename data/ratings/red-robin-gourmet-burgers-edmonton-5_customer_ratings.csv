10,El M.,"Edmonton, Canada",0,1,,5.0,2016-04-18,I ate here with my wife on their grand opening. I am so impressed with the customer service. The food was PHENOMENAL!! From the appetizers to the entrees....everything was fantastic. I can say hands down that was the best burger Ive ever eaten!! We will definitely be returning.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edmonton-5,,,,,
11,Daisy Y.,"Vancouver, Canada",72,174,362.0,2.0,2016-04-18,"Came here for their soft opening.  It had been years since I've last dined at Red Robin.  The food was nothing to write home about, and considering that our meal was about $45, you can definitely do better.  My friend and I shared the bruschetta (underwhelming and flavorless), and we each ordered a salad. My friend ordered the brand new Insane Romaine salad, which was basically served as an entire head of romaine cut in half.  Probably not the best way to be serving your salad, and no, it did not look ""fancy"", it looked ridiculous.  I had the crispy chicken tender salad that wasn't too bad. Service was average.  Decor in a brand new restaurant is always nice; we enjoyed the glass bottle light fixtures.  Only complaint is that in their effort to pack in more people, they have really small tables and it makes you feel squished in when it's busy.  (some may like to call it ""intimate"").  All in all, I'd say unless you're in a pinch, there are much better dining options available.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edmonton-5,,,,,
2,Vicki M.,"Edmonton, Canada",114,339,1157.0,4.0,2016-05-25,"Craving a burger, my husband and I came here for a late dinner on a Saturday night. This new Red Robins is way more upscale looking compared to the other locations around town.  We were greeted quickly and pleasantly upon entry by two hostesses. Seated just as quick and provided with a tableside travel cot for our baby who was in his car seat - nice touch! I haven't been to a Red Robins in many years so it was nice to see their new upscale burger options! Of the three we tried (Smoke & Pepper burger; Southern Charm burger; and wild pacific salmon burger) our favourites were the Southern Charm for its sweet and savoury notes and the salmon burger because the salmon was perfectly prepared and not dry.  Service from Calvin was pretty good as well.  Good to know their beef comes from Alberta! (I asked)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edmonton-5,,,,,
7,Victor R.,"Las Vegas, NV",48,3,4.0,1.0,2016-06-22,"Terrible service.  For a family restaurant they seem to have no clue when it comes eating out with kids.  Even though we arrived with no one in front of us in line, they seated the family after us first and then we watched them setup another table for some huge reservation that obviously had priority over us while we just sat there and waited and waited and waited.  Our kids are pretty young and were getting impatient.  My wife had to go up and remind them and eventually we were seated.  Red robins typically aren't this awful, what a disappointment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edmonton-5,,,,,
6,Elaine S.,"Edmonton, Canada",2,26,3.0,2.0,2016-08-17,"Went to this location for the first time on Monday. I told the hostess we were celebrating my daughter's birthday. She said she would inform the server and they would help celebrate.  My husband ordered the Prime Rib dip and the meat was dry and looked charred.  No mention  of her birthday so I don't know what they do for a celebration. The rest of the food was ok, the service was mediocre. Other than being close to home there wasn't much to write about.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edmonton-5,,,,,
3,Andrea W.,"Edmonton, Canada",91,117,584.0,5.0,2016-09-12,"Red Robin is one of my favorite Burger's restaurant, love to try new things every time but also like to order the same. I like the layout of this location, it's so welcoming and comfy, I really liked the way the tables are organized and the variety of sizes. Enough booths for 6 people, tables for 4 and small ones for two, they also can arrange them if your party is bigger. Servers were really nice and helpful, don't hesitate to ask them about the menu, they know everything about their specialties. This time we ordered some onions rings to share, I had the banzai burger wrapped in lettuce and garlic potatoes wages. I have to say that the pineapple is a great touch. As always I ordered buzz sauce just to add enough spicy to the meal.  For dessert we order the Towering Doh Rings, the hot fudge was delightful. I would definitely come back to this location, 5 starts for their service, food, design, decor, ambiance and background music!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edmonton-5,,,,,
5,Rahimah M.,"Edmonton, Canada",87,166,491.0,4.0,2016-09-15,"I used to go to Red Robins when i was a teen and now one has opened up close to where i live. This one has a bit more of a classy, sophisticated feel. Clean with extremely friendly and welcoming staff. Seating was quick and accommodating for families with children.  Restaurant seating from front entry to back with the bar being upfront.  For myself, I had the Benzai burger- old school and a favorite. I love getting the fries and adding the Red Robin Seasoning to it.  My friend braved it and got one of the delux specials. Both were more excited for the dessert to come so we only ate half of what we ordered. NOTE  go on a completely empty stomach in starvation mode because the food is great and you will want to eat it all! I used to go for the Mud Pie - a staple dessert ""back in the day."" However, the new dessert in town was the Tower of Doh Rings. Freshly made - sweet and salty at the same time with two dipping sauces. It would be a sin not to finish the tower, than God there was two of us! Service was great and would recommend that location to anyone.  In agreement with everyone else,  that this is a better up-to-date and upscale version of their franchise and worth the trip to Windemere. Easy to find in the complex with ample parking stalls.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edmonton-5,,,,,
12,Man D.,"Edmonton, Canada",0,1,,3.0,2016-11-20,"Usually their service is pretty good, I've been here since they first opened.  However, don't come here if you're hungry!  They always take a long time for everything!  The servers are used to coming up to your table and apologize for the wait.  I will keep my first statement true until today.  We came and waited at the front for about 15 minutes when I saw a table right there! Okay, fine, maybe they need to prepare for something.  Then the host sat us down at that table I saw.  Again, okay.... but no server greeted us or offered us water for over 10 minutes. I had to walk out too find a manager so someone would take our order.   The server came and we told him we can order. He asked what we like to drink so I told him ""I wanted blah blah and...."" cuts me off and ask the next person.  Does it matter what order you do things? You put it on the same piece of paper!  Finally our drink came. BUT! There's something in my ice! Eww.  This is like my worse night out!  I just wanted to relax and not cook at home.  Have to be fair, honestly the food is okay. I always like the variety of choices you have at this family restaurant. But if you want to have a stressless night, don't go there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edmonton-5,,,,,
8,Robin B.,"Edmonton, Canada",4,35,,5.0,2017-01-29,Great atmosphere. I love the red tables and chairs! Service was excellent and the food was fantastic.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edmonton-5,,,,,
9,Tommy J.,"Pitt Meadows, Canada",0,1,,1.0,2017-03-07,It would be easier to review if they had a phone number posted so I could order for pick up.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edmonton-5,,,,,
4,Kelly V.,"Saint Albert, Canada",29,4,,4.0,2017-06-15,Went and had a quick dinner last night with the hubby all was great. One complaint I ordered a cob salad off the light menu. I believe it 565 and some cals then plus your salad dressing cals probably made it close 800 cals I asked for a have order they don't do that. Who in there right mind can eat one off these in full. Its huge! The guy says well they keep well for tomorrow.  If your going to do a light menu have a light menu it's all about the cals you know thay because you have the cals beside the items. That meal would be all most my whole days cals. As I said service and food was fantastic but not everyone on a diet or not can eat that portion size. Please make half orders.  Thank you,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edmonton-5,,,,,
0,D. B.,"Edmonton, Canada",4,42,8.0,5.0,2017-07-07,"So my husband and I had to go to Walmart in Windermere and decided we'd do an impromptu dinner date as well. We drove past Red Robin and realized nether of us had been there in over 8 years, and the patio seemed super appealing so in we went. (We loved that there were no children on the patio - we don't know if this is a rule or if it was simply too hot but regardless that was a plus for us!) Our waiter was very friendly and didn't mind that we were both a little overwhelmed by the menu and number of options! (We had literally both almost finished our Corona before ordering which NEVER happens). We both tried burgers from their Tavern menu and I got yam fries on the side while my husband got the onion rings. Both meals were incredibly delicious and we felt it was great value for all that we got! I also particularly love how they give you options to make your meal more healthy - I didn't feel like an idiot asking for my burger to be bunless since it's an option right in the menu.  We will definitely be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edmonton-5,,,,,
1,Shaun R.,"Calgary, Canada",1,60,,2.0,2017-10-25,Service was great not sure why the food was below average . Sides with all our meals were almost cold . The main courses (burgers) we not served fresh . The place had a wait list at the front door on a sat night . Appetizers were only item hot and fresh . Tried this place years ago before when calgary had them .. sadly won't be going back here,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-edmonton-5,,,,,
