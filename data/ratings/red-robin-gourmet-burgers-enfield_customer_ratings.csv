52,Katie C.,"Boston, MA",180,587,92.0,3.0,2012-01-24,"We stopped in this location on our way down to NYC as a place to grab a quick bite to eat. The service was great.  Our server was awesome with greeting us quickly and getting our food to us as quickly as possible.   The food wasnt bad - its not gourmet food but genuine comfort food served with endless fries. There are few things in life that are better than endless, fresh, hot fries.   My only gripe about this particular location was that when we walked in after the dinner rush, the place was a mess!!  The tables hadn't been cleared and there was no sign of any recent attempt to do so. Ps- if you don't like screaming and unruly kids, this place definitely isn't for you!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-enfield?start=40,3.308,3.308,3.308,3.308,3.308

The best thing is the service at this location and the value on the food.  You kind of know what to expect at a Red Robin its not amazing food but its decent.  I was really impressed with how often the waitress came to check on us. The menu allows you to customize your burgers the way you like. I had broccoli for my side but my hubby who ordered fish and chips wanted the unlimited feature that the burger comes with the waitress totally accommodated us with no issues. Drinks and floats are unlimited and our server came to refill and check on us often even when we haven't finished our drinks. If you are a onion ring fan you must get the Tower of Rings!! Its a stack of lovely thick cut deep fried onions served on a tower stand. Sauces were also pretty yummy. Both times we came in were peak meal times and there were lots of kids and people waiting to be seated and we still didn't have to wait more than 15 mins which probably would have deterred us from staying so good job on moving tables and seating ppl quickly.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-enfield?start=40,3.1800000000000006,3.1800000000000006,3.1800000000000006,3.1800000000000006,3.1800000000000006

RR is honestly not my top choice when I am around the Enfield area but my friends seem to love it so I've ended up there 3 times now. We were on our way back from Mt. Snow and a friend suggested this RR. The burgers are pretty good for what they are meant to be, I do appreciate how they offer the well done option or the 'some pink' option. That way you are not expecting a perfect medium rare burger but hey, it's RR. You come here for a quick burger that's better than fast food but not as good as Plan B. There was a 20 minute waiting time for us to be seated which was understandable, my friend and i decided to sit at the bar and grab a drink which was nice. A couple of beers on tap, we went for the large blue moon at around ~$7. I also tried a mix drink with fireball and peace in it (can't remember the name) which was surprisingly good but pretty weak. The burgers came out in a timely manner and we all enjoyed them. My 5 alarm burger was pretty good and the fries were hot and fresh. I ordered the buffalo sauce, which went great with the secret red robin sauce that my friend had. Bottomless fries came out pretty quickly too! Service was extremely friendly.

On our way to Vermont via Route 91, we stopped off for gas and a bite to eat in Enfield and noticed a Red Robin. We thought, ""What is this Red Robin all about?"" Gourmet burgers... hmmmm... yes please! The staff was more than friendly and helpful. Our server, George, was happy to explain the different burger levels and the grade-levels of beef. We ordered the Pepper and Southern burgers, as is, with no customization (which is very welcomed, i.e. you can pick and choose what you want on your burger). We completely enjoyed our meals - the hamburger meat was perfectly done, flavorful and juicy! The toppings were fresh (even the lettuce was delightful and unique - more like greens vs. ice burg lettuce) and the sauces were delicious. We had the option to have more complimentary steak fries, but we were too full - but it's nice to know that more is an option. Would someone please open up a Red Robin in Southeastern CT? :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-enfield,3.64,3.64,3.64,,3.6400000000000006

I had the Cobb salad and I held the bacon, and it wasn't bad for a chain restaurant. The vegetables were OK, they definitely weren't picked out of someone's garden, but it was decent. Favorite: We had the donuts and they were definitely a five. I think that they were some kind of crough-nut (that trendy croissant & doughnut fusion) and they had some chocolate dipping sauce and some other raspberry sauce and it was really delicious. I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants, but I actually really enjoyed eating at this place. Kid friendly?  Check!  Great service?  Check! Outside seating?  Check!  Overall, good.

I've recently had to go gluten-free, so I'm still figuring out what I can eat and where.  The GF menu is online, but we were having trouble finding it (you have to select a menu item before it gives you the ""allergen menu"" which will filter everything). 1. Yvette sat down with us and went through the physical menu describing the various options and things to avoid.  This was fantastic and unprecedented. 2.  Red Robin actually has a lot of options for GF eaters.  GF buns for any of their burgers, the fries and seasoning are already GF (and bottomless!).  It's fantastic to see a restaurant putting some obvious thought into their menu options.  I'm sure it's hell for the kitchen staff, but this customer is immensely grateful.

11,Bill S.,"Litchfield, CT",155,540,1.0,4.0,2016-11-06,"Yeah, we're fans. The reasons are pretty simple: the burgers are awfully good, the service has never failed to be first class, and you can get a beer or a cocktail or a milk shake (and not necessarily in that order). What's not to like about that? We've often stopped at the Red Robin in Holyoke, but this franchise is every bit as clean and appealing. The crispy bottomless fries are yummy (you can get sweet potato fries, too), and their chicken dishes and salads are good.  Yes it's a chain operation, so let's not be comparing it to fine dining establishments. For what it is, however, it's well worth a stop for the reasons listed above. Cheerburger, dill pickle and a cold beer.

For an app I'd start with towering onion rings and extra campfire sauce & ranch or a sampler of jalapeño coins and mozz sticks. Burger: Burnin' Love. Again...ranch, ranch, and more ranch. Dip it. If you want a more classic burger get the Royal. It's delicious. AND THE FRIES? They're are so good!!(ask for them extra crispy or garlic parm and dip them in ranch) If you're polite and could smile and maybe make eye contact with your server when you talk to them, they'll bring you more fries all the time. Dessert is nothing to write home about. They have a full bar and some cool beer and cocktail creations so there's something for kids and adults.

It was a very busy Friday night and there were several people in front of us on the list waiting when we arrived. It was just my wife and I tonight so I figured getting a table wouldn't be too bad. We waited about 15 minutes to get a table, which is pretty good considering it was a packed house. Our server tonight was Jessica. She was on her A game tonight. She told us she was newer there but you could tell she is a seasoned waitress. She was very attentive, keeping our drinks full without once being asked. She was very pleasant and very genuine, which says a lot for her based on the amount of tables she had tonight. We both ordered lettuce wrapped royal red Robin burgers. We both asked for our eggs to be cooked a little extra, and they were cooked perfectly! The burger was delicious, the side salads were fresh and delicious. We did split one basket of fries as our way of ""cheating"" and they were cooked perfectly and arrived piping hot. They were nice and crispy, not overdone or soggy.

Rather noisy, which is to be expected in a restaurant that caters to families with kids, etc. Food came, A-1 Pepper corn burger with their famous ""bottomless"" fries. Fries were okay, the burger didn't have a lot of flavor curiously enough and was rather greasy (not a good greasy, but the sign of poor quality ground beef type greasy) and not very warm on top of everything else. The best part of my experience was the tall, ice cold Yuengling Lager. For an establishment that specializes in Burger's I felt let down to say the least.

The burger came out quick and hot-all fresh ingredients (meat, bun, lettuce, tomato.) I don't know if they make the bacon fresh, but it sure tasted like it. So, a good burger. I substituted Cole slaw for the fries-it had Dijon mustard in it. I'm not a fan of mustard, but this tasted pretty good. And, apparently the Cole slaw is bottomless. (As are many of the sides).
