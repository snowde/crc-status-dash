She proceeds to walk over to our table with her mouth full and tell us how hungry she was and she was starving because she had to work later than expected. EW, first of all and more importantly, she should have washed her hands. Then she handed us two to-go containers with her nasty fingers that she was just stuffing her face with. I got up and got two other clean to go containers and asked for a manager. The manager was one of he people she was eating with and showed no concern at all for the waitress violating the "" workers must wash their hands before and after returning to work"" rule. All he said was, ""I will talk to her about that."" Nothing more, nothing less. I even let him know that I work in a restaurant as a waitress and that is just unacceptable because people can get sick if one is not washing their hands regularly.

I used to LOVE their burgers - however, I was pretty underwhelmed with my most recent experience here. I came with my boyfriend for lunch on a weekday, and it was super packed but we got seated right away in the bar. Our server was decent - not bad but not overly friendly/attentive either. And that basically summed up the rest of our visit: good enough, but not outstanding. We both had their spiciest burger and fries, which we found to be tasty but overly greasy. It was just kind of a juicy mess :P Nothing came super hot either, and the fries were waaaay overseasoned. I love that Red Robin seasoning, but not enough to eat something covered in it! It's crazy salty when it's not used in moderation! If you love it here, no problem. But if you think their burgers and fries are missing a little something and you want to try something else in North County, I'd recommend Sublime Ale House or Churchill's Pub in San Marcos or the Flying Pig in Oceanside.

I went to Red Robin with a friend around 1:45-2:45 today for lunch. We were sat at a high top bar table and were told Veronica was going to take care of us. When Veronica finally came to our table she right from the start had a rude approach of greeting us. The host sat us in the bar area because we are of age and the location was busy. She took our order and from that moment on Veronica never helped us even though she was our assigned ""server."" We both needed a refill on our drinks & I had to grab another server to do it. This servers name was Nick & he was very helpful the entire visit. Another server brought our food to us. Veronica never asked us how the meal was or if we needed anything ever during our lunch visit. Yet again we needed a refill on our drinks & Nick once again grabbed the refill for us & was very kind & helpful. We were about done & another guy Joe pre bused the area for us & brought my friend a box for her leftover wrap. He also made my Freckled Lemonade in a TOGO cup for me to take. We sat for a while & Joe came by and asked us if we needed anything I then told him we needed a check to pay. Joe brought me the check & also wrote my phone # on the check so I could get my reward points. We put the check presenter on the edge of our table with the credit cards sticking out to pay the bill. Still no Veronica to take our payment or help us in anway/shape or form. Veronica had an empty bar with no guests & there really was no excuse why she couldn't ""serve"" our table. My friend I was with brought the check up to Joe at the bar & he cashed us out. I have been in the service industry for 11 years & a fellow bartender myself and this lack of service was terrible. Before we left I made sure to hand my tip to the nice gentlemen Nick who took care of us. My friend who is not in the service industry left her tip for Veronica even though she never helped us. I take care of servers when I go out. Being in this industry customer service is HUGE!! When we left she was doing side work for the bar  like stocking juices & fruit. Your guests should always come first no matter what. She never said goodbye or thanks for coming in nor did anyone else. No greetings of any kind when we left.

209,Melanie V.,"Henderson, NV",96,94,9.0,3.0,2014-02-19,"I am a HUGE Red Robin fan.  This is my absolute favorite place to dine.  This specific location, however, could definitely use some work. My husband and I decided that since our #1 choice was closed down, we would go here for Valentine's Day.  After all, I moved to Oceanside 8 months ago, and there isn't a Red Robin nearby, so we decided Valentine's Day was a good excuse for the 25 minute drive to Escondido. We got to the restaurant, and of course it was pretty busy.  We expected that.  We put our name in, and were told a 45 minute wait.  No problem.  We let the hostess know we were going to sit at the bar until our table was ready.  My first complaint is that you cannot hear ANYTHING from the hostess stand when you are sitting at the bar.  The microphone is so quiet.  My husband had to keep going up to make sure they hadn't called our table.  Almost every party there was a party of 2, being as it was Valentine's Day, so that didn't help to hear ""party of 2"" and think it was us either. Once at the bar, my hubby ordered beer, and I ordered a freckled lemonade (I am pregnant.)  I asked the bartender if the tab could be moved to our table once we were seated, and he said that no, we would have to pay the tab at the bar.  Um, what?  I was going to have to pay for TWO drinks?  That didn't make any sense.  I went ahead and ordered it anyway.  The first drink was good, but the second drink had hardly any strawberries in it.  That is the part that I like.  My husband said his beer was good, of course. We ended up getting seated in the bar area around a hour later, so we actually were able to move our drinks to the table.  I was happy about that.  The bartender was actually our server and took forever to come take our order. We ordered the new tavern fries, a Whiskey River BBQ burger (veggie patty) with a salad with ranch on the side, and I cannot recall the name of the burger my husband got, but he stated twice that he wanted to add bacon to his.   The tavern fries came out first.  They were very tasty, however the server never brought out napkins.  With them being covered in cheese and sauce, napkins would have been awesome.   Then the food came out.  I didn't get any ranch with my salad, and my husband's burger came out without bacon on it.  We had to send whoever brought out the food back for the ranch and bacon.  I also still did not have any silverware, which is hard to deal with when eating salad.  I had to wait for the bartender to come back around and ask for it.  Annoying.  The food itself was good, as always.   Then the bill came.  They include a Red Robin Royalty card in the bill holder hoping you will sign up.  Well, I already have a card, so we took that card out, and put mine in with my credit card.  The bartender took the bill and brought everything back.  The receipts always say how close you are to getting your free item on the bottom.  My receipt did not say anything about my royalty card.  When I called the bartender back over, he seemed confused when I asked if he ran my card.  He said that he made a mistake, and that the royalty card in the bill actually belonged to another customer, and picked it up off of our table.  I had to stop him and explain that that was MY card, and that it wasn't ran.  I asked him to please go and put it through to both check my name on the card, and to check my purchased items.  He almost gave my card away!  I was super irritated by this point.  I got my card back, and we left. I am hoping that it was busy and confusing because of it being a holiday.  We will try it one more time, and if it doesn't improve, we will just wait until one of our monthly trips to Vegas to dine here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-escondido?start=200,3.16,3.47,3.47,2.9240000000000004,3.346

I have never had a bad menu item, a bad wait person, a bad host/hostess or a long wait. The place is often crowded, yet we never have to wait to be seated. On our most recent visit, the hostess said ""We had 2 wait staff call in sick, so please be patient. so-and-so, your waiter, will be with you as soon as he can. Everyone is covering other stations."" OMG-have you ever had someone at least communicate that way? THIS is customer service. In spite of this, our waiter was at our table in less than 3 minutes, took our drink order and left us to casually read through the menu as we requested. We have even gone here during what I call the ""after church"" time-that  1-2ish time on Sunday after the late church services when it's really loud and full. Makes not a bit of difference-still the same great food and service. Like other reviewers, this in one of my favorite casual dining places. WAY TO GO, RED ROBIN!

165,Lynn H.,"San Diego, CA",9,44,205.0,5.0,2014-10-23,"We visited in the late afternoon on a weekday so it wasn't crowded. I'm not a big fan of the decor (every inch of the walls covered in pictures) although I do appreciate the ample amount of booths that the have.  We were seated quickly and greeted within 2 minutes, although our server Max was tasked with 5 tables in our vicinity, I have to say that he was really on the ball. He moved quickly and handled them all with ease.  He was friendly, very helpful with suggestions and had no problems with special orders. He thoughtfully brought our burger already cut in half along with two plates. He also was quick with the refills so we didn't have to ask. I love that! I noticed that he was attentive to his other tables as well. I really liked that when we asked for something that he immediately went to retrieve it. Some servers will will make you wait ten minutes for something so that the can combine their trips to the kitchen. Max made us feel like he really cared about his customers.  Strawberry Lemonade: Comes in a cool looking glass, has real strawberries and has a great fresh taste. It even comes with refills! ($3.00) Yukon chips and French onion dip: The dip reminds me my childhood days when we used to make our own from the Lipton onion soup mix.  (5.00) The (onion) O-ring shorty: love the flavor of the crispy rings and the size was just right for three to share. Jalapeño coins: These are so addictive. Deep fried pickled jalapeños! Yummy! Smoke & Pepper burger: I have to say it wasn't my favorite burger. But in defense of Red Robin I have to say that I was asked to share with someone else. I prefer American cheese and no ketchup not cheddar. The burger itself was cooked perfectly (juicy) medium rare and seasoned well. If I had ordered a regular cheeseburger it would have been perfect.  Bacon Cheeseburger: Juicy and delicious. I wasn't in love with the garlic fries so I'll order them plain next time. Overall our visit here was pleasant and the food was tasty.

We then asked for some roll ups with our fries since we didn't receive any one out food was dropped off and she responded with ""we don't do that here anymore"" and literally tossed a stack of paper napkins on our table. She didn't smile once nor say your welcome to any of our thank you's.

The last time I was here I just came for a quick happy hour after an exhausting day of Christmas shopping!  My friend ordered a beer ($3.25) and I had a margarita ($5), and we shared an order of parmesan herb fries (which weren't on happy hour).  While sitting in the bar, service was quick and it wasn't too crowded.  The fries were surprisingly good, and I'd definitely order them again.

We are now getting mediocre service about once in every three visits. Today was the capper for me. First, when we arrived we were told that the wait is about 25 minutes. We gave the staff our phone number so that we could get a text when a table is ready. After about 35 minutes, we inquired about the timing. It will be another 15 minutes, they said. After another 20 minutes we inquired again. It will be another five minutes. In all, our 25 minute estimate turned into an hour. Is this red robin location just that bad at forecasting? I guess so. One of the young female hostesses seemed very put out by us asking for updates on the timing as well. Maybe she was having a bad day. Regardless, she shouldn't be so obvious about the disdain she had for our questions. Finally, our server was not attentive. I had an empty glass that needed refilling. She went by at least three times and stopped at our table twice before I asked her for a refill. There was no way that she was going to offer on her own. We also asked for no seasoning on one person's fries. We ended up getting no seasoning on anyone's fries. Additionally, our chips and baja dip were sorry. The chips were so greasy (wet) that we had to get a replacement. The server didn't notice? How did they get to us in that sorry state?  All around? Just a poor effort by this location today.

My sister replied ""I know, I was just checking to see if you had remembered seeing as it's so busy here..no need to be rude"". And the lady looked at us and said with attitude ""I'm just letting YOU know I already did."" Ok. We really considered leaving but again, the hunger won out. Then the lady goes to her male server friend and looks ar us and obviously is whispering about us. And then what happens? The guy is now our server. And he was equally rude.

I do however love the food at Red Robin, especially the Banzai Burger and the fries with ranch, but a restaurant shouldn't solely rely on their tasty food to get by. One of the few problems I encountered at this location was that most of the staff appeared to be completely clueless. I was baffled at how awful they were actually. They weren't even busy and we waited at the front for someone to seat us for 5 or more minutes. Several employees even acknowledged that we were standing there waiting and didn't come over to say a word to us, which is completely rude. Once we were seated, it took only a few minutes for a waitress to come over and take our drink order. Along with that, we ordered the ""bottomless"" fries. On a side note, what is the deal with Red Robin's so called ""bottomless"" fries? Every single location I go to does the same exact thing when I ask for a basket of the ""bottomless"" fries. They come back with a basket of about 7 French fries and expect two people to share them. It's basically a race to get to the 7th fry because no one is satisfied with eating only 3 fries. Come on now! It took a while for our 7 fries to get to our table. Our waitress claimed that a new batch was being made. I'm assuming if a new batch really was being made, they could afford to give us more than 7 fries since they weren't busy, but I digress. After roughly a few minutes passed, my boyfriend and I were done with the fries and put the empty basket toward the edge of the table for our waitress to take and refill. Conveniently, she walked passed our table several times, ignoring us and the basket we had placed right in front of her face. She seemed to check up on every other table in her section except for the one with the empty fry basket. I actually find it comical. I am not mad at all. It just seems like this always happens at every Red Robin. Are they trained to do this? Right when we sensed that our food was about to come out, our waitress finally stopped by our table, giving us the opportunity to ask for more fries. Sure enough, a minute later our food came out and we really didn't need the extra fries anymore. Go figure. I hate to call anyone out, but our waitress just seemed dazed. Maybe she was having a bad day or something. It happens. I was just disappointed with her lack of checking up on us. She couldn't even remember what drinks we ordered and all we got was a coke and water. As she continued to pass us without stopping, we started looking around to see if we could make eye contact with another server. A few employees looked at us and looked away. Finally, something great happened! We got a new server (shift switch or something). Our new waiter was so attentive and quick. If it weren't for him, I would have left there thinking much less of this location. I still don't think very highly of the service at Red Robin in general (the fry conspiracy bothers me the most) but lucky for them, I love their food and will keep going back for more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-escondido?start=200,3.04,3.21,3.21,2.9200000000000004,3.142

Some friends from WA. and I were talking about Jr. High days, prompted by my Whatcom Falls review recently and we reminisced that another staple of those days was bottomless fries at Red Robin (with a side of ranch). Then we started talking about their milkshakes, then the burgers, then we were all singing the Red Robin birthday song (and clapping) so we had to head over to recount it all with an actual experience.  When I was 15, I don't remember the throngs of children and parents - just the thrill of being at a restaurant with boys and without my folks. I don't recall the servers rolling their eyes at a group of teenagers ordering the cheapest things on the menu - just basket after basket of pipping hot fries and strawberry lemonades. I don't remember thinking about the quality of the food, but rather, just trying not to turn as red as their mascot bird when my birthday and a sundae arrived to the embarrassing tune of their servings singing the birthday song. It was all a small town sunday afternoon after the mall thing for me.  My grown up visit recently wasn't as magical, but hey, times have changed. The fries where still good (although lacking in amounts they first dropped at the table, literally the BF had less than a handful on the side of his burger in the first round) and my older - now tummy flipped at the idea of a milkshake (I had reached my dairy limit for the day). We noticed all the baby cries and server faux pas - gone was the blissful experience of my youth. The burger though, was yummy and tasted just like 'merica... the memories kept the dinner alive.

85,Brittney S.,"Temecula, CA",284,274,426.0,3.0,2015-10-12,"Ventured into Escondido to come to Red Robin for my free birthday burger. Restaurant was busy and we had to wait 15 minutes to be seated but overall we had a pretty good experience. When it's your birthday month, be sure to sign up for their rewards. Hey, who doesn't love a free burger? You can choose any burger you want with the exception of the 3 promotional burgers. I ordered the gourmet burger wrapped in lettuce. Lettuce was fresh, burger was juicy, toppings were on point. Steak fries come bottomless but I didn't need a refill due to being full from the burger. Husband wanted to order the jump start app which was a pick two type thing, and he opted for the cheese sticks and fried jalapeños. There is something about dipping a fried jalapeño in ranch that is just delicious!!! I HIGHLY recommended the jalapeños. Our server brought me a little sundae to enjoy with the hubby for my birthday. That of course was delicious too. We found a spot, but parking can be super rough during ""rush hour"" mall times. Red Robin is over by the Sears.  Definitely a good restaurant for the kids. For some reason whenever we show up at a restaurant we get asked if we need a kids menu and coloring paper. Our kid is 7 months old.. She doesn't eat restaurant food, nor can she color quite yet! Hilarious BUT the hostess proceeded to leave crayons and coloring paper on our table. Gee, thanks.  Our server was quick, attentive and super nice. My only drawback is the little iPad looking things on the table. Beware that if you click on the ""games"" you're actually paying $1.99 to play them.

83,Anthony S.,"Temecula, CA",324,262,830.0,4.0,2015-10-12,"Food: they have a ton of different burgers to choose from here. They have a variety of bread and dipping sauces to choose from too. We ordered cheese sticks and Jalapeño coins ($7) as our appetizer. Came with about 4 cheese sticks and a large handful of jalapeños. Both were really good and I would definitely get again. Came with pizza sauce and ranch. Jalapeños were just below moderately spicy. I ordered the A1 Steakhouse burger ($11.49)and it came with fried onions, cheese, bacon and A1 seasoned beef patty. The party was average size and a little on the dry side. Flavor was good. The bun included was an onion bun and it was very moist. It held up well throughout the whole burger. Their burgers come w steak fries and they are bottomless. These are pretty decent as well and they have Red Robin seasoning at each table. They automatically serve you ranch w these fries.  Service: hostesses at the from were bland and not personable. Waiting only 15 minutes on a Sunday in October. Our server was very friendly and energetic. He was very attentive and our drinks were promptly refilled. You pay with your card by using a touchscreen device at each table. These devices also have the menu on them as well as games. Be ware because the games seem easy to start playing, but they charge you on your bill. This wasn't clear to us and we played a game and wasted $1.99.  Atmosphere: TVs all over. We had no problem watching the SNF game. They aren't the largest TVs in the restaurant section, but this is no sports bar. There are cool pictures everywhere. It is very crowded here on busy days. Great for large parties.  Parking: mall parking is not great. It is located next to Sears at the mall. Parking can be a pain.  Tip: sign up for their Red Robin Royalty for free online or at your table and you will get a free burger during the month of your birthday. This will save you $10.

80,Laurie B.,"Vista, CA",216,208,4090.0,5.0,2015-11-08,"One of my favorite places ever. This place is conveniently located inside the North County Mall close to Sears I believe. There is plenty of parking, although you might have to walk awhile but not really a big deal. The restaurant is of decent size. They have a little patio area to the side of the restaurant where you can watch people enter/exist the mall, and also shop.  Also have tables, booths an a bar area for seating. Entertainment for the kids include Arcade games, and such. Since the last time I've been here they have expanded their menu to more gourmet burgers, and other new items. They have an electronic device on all the tables which you can order your appetizers, desserts. Drinks, main food are ordered through your waiter/or waitress. If you would like to split your check or pay without having to wait on your server you can do so which I appreciate.  I came here an ordered their side salad to be brought out first since I was extremely hungry. Pretty basic- lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, croutons and your choice of dressing in a little cup. Still very good. The server brought out a red plate with napkins and silverware on top. I had the Fiery Ghost Style Tavern double. It has the ghost pepper sauce and jalapenos a few bites of this will have you wanting something refreshing to wash it down with. I usually get the Burnin love burger which has pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayonnaise, canned chipotle peppers, salsa, jalapenos, tomatoes. But I decided to try something different.  Both are very very delicious. Can't really go wrong with anything on the menu. Fries are a good amount, and you can always ask for more if you want. They have their special red robin seasoning for the fries on the table which gives it that extra flavor. The only thing I would critique this place on is the tubs they use gathering all the dishes, glasses etc once they clean off the tables. Something I don't like seeing as I'm eating my meal. Maybe put a napkin over it or pick plates up while your walking around (without the tub).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-escondido?start=80,3.0,3.16,3.16,3.156,3.0960000000000005

The milkshake was insanely delicious! I got the strawberry one, and they used real strawberries and cream which made it really good! They also put a bunch of whipped cream on top and some sprinkles. When the burger came, I was kind of surprised because it seemed smaller than I expected but I wasn't that disappointed because I don't eat a ton anyways. The biggest disappointment was the secret sauce which I hardly tasted (although I got to say, red robins does have a habit of slathering on too much sauce and making the buns soggy so this was probably a good thing!) and the fact that I had maybe 10 fries on my plate. I know the fries are unlimited but it just seemed like they could have added like ten more fries and could have saved themselves from washing more dishes and looking skimpy. The one thing I did really appreciate about the fries was they no longer seem to season them so you can have them plain or put as much special seasoning on them as you like!! Personally, I really enjoyed my meal when it comes down to it. However, my stepdad ordered the roast beef sandwich expected better chunks of meat, and said his sandwich tasted just like Arby's but cheaper meat cut...

I'm not exaggerating when I say that the I haven't tasted a chicken breast that had that much flavor since I was in Paris. It. Was. Awesome.

They're also usually always packed, especially during dinner time and even more hectic on weekends and holidays. Do expect anytime between 10min - 1 hour wait depending on what time or day you go and how big your party is. Service is always pretty good, except they're not so great on refilling your waters.

I love that they offer two different dipping sauces with their onion rings. Prime Chophouse $10.59 (A fire-grilled burger layered with horseradish-sautéed mushrooms, gourmet steak sauce, Provolone, Country Dijon and crispy onion straws on an onion bun) This burger is pretty delicious but the only thing I don't like is that it does get really messy.

I've eaten here and gotten great service, and I eaten here and had bad service.  In the case of the bad service it was (partly) my fault. What I mean is I am diabetic and we got to Red Robin around 4:30 pm and I had literally not eaten all day. Now, I know better than to do that, but somehow it just happened. That being the case, when our waiter came to the table for the drink order I let him know the situation and that I really needed something to snack on immediately because I was sugar-crashing. So I ordered a soda and some chips and salsa.  My hope was that he would go straight to the back, grab a basket of chips/salsa and come right back.  Didn't happen. He was gone about 10+ minutes when he showed up with the diet sodas..no chips. He dropped of the drinks and said he was going to ""check"" on the chips/salsa. As I watched him more-or-less make his rounds to all his tables I realized he was not going anywhere near the kitchen anytime soon. Eventually, a different server showed up an about another 5+ minutes with the chips/salsa.  So, the thing is, its not really his problem that I waited to long to eat, am diabetic, and all that stuff. So I get it. At the same time though, it just kinda seems like he could've maybe been a little more understanding of the jam I got myself into and just ran to the kitchen and gotten me some chips.

The menu says the Chili-chili cheeseburger is served ""open-faced with a generous helping of chili and cheese"", but what you ACTUALLY get is a closed face burger with just enough chili for you to know it's there. This place does a lot of business, and chili is pretty cheap. This is a perfect example of a stupid management trying to save money the WRONG way.  My wife ordered a signature drink, the ""Sand in your Shorts"". She had it before, and liked it. It is vodka and triple sec and chambourd with orange and cranberry juice and, I think, a touch of grenadine (something like that, at least.  This time, she gets a screwdriver with a little chambourd, MAYBE! And that drink took 15 minutes! Sorry to split hairs, but if you charge 8 bucks for a drink, make sure your bartender knows how to make it! At least hire bartenders who know ""if you can't think, make it pink!""  Our kids meals suddenly start coming with 6 fries. It doesn't even LOOK like they're trying! I'm sick of enduring sub-standard burgers for the sake of pleasing kids who only like the atmosphere, just so I can come away $75 lighter and unsatisfied. This has gone on long enough.

I'm now former customer, and my kids will have to find someone else to serve them generic Sysco chicken strips.

There is a great variety of burgers and the 'bottomless' fries have consistently made us happy.  Unfortunately, I am no longer a happy customer. For ten or more years, I've always - ALWAYS - ordered grilled onions, and have been told each time that they were available for no charge. Today I came in to the Escondido location for my usual order - Sautéed 'Shroom Burger with grilled onions. I was told there would be an extra charge for the onions. I asked if this was a new policy, and the server told me that is how it has always been. (I'm 100% sure I've been coming here longer than she has worked here.) She had the manager, Randy, come over to discuss it with me. He told me I should've been charged all along, and implied that I (as well as the hundreds of servers from whom I've ordered my burgers) have been doing something wrong. I tried to tell him I had never tried to 'cheat the system' or 'get free stuff' when I shouldn't have. I truly felt he was close to asking me to reimburse them for the (no longer) ""free"" onions. Had he simply said, ""I don't know; it's possible that it's a new policy"" - I wouldn't have been upset. Instead, he made me feel guilty.  Additionally, we asked twice for the standard basket of fries to be delivered before our food, and didn't receive it at all (until we asked two MORE times AFTER our food had already been delivered.) Instead we each were given about nine or ten small fries with our food. Really?

Their food is not fantastic, but I always know what to expect when I dine-in at one. Consequently, I have never been disappointed - until today.  While shopping around the Westfield Mall, I decided to grab dinner at Red Robin and walked over to the open bar seating after being addressed to do so by a hostess. We shuffled through tables to find one that was clean (although the bar area was nearly empty). We seated ourselves by swapping out the dirty chairs at our clean table with some other chairs that were not being used. There were three women behind the bar that were conversing with each other and seemingly had no sense of urgency to clean the 4/5 tables that were dirty or to even bring us a menu.  The combination of dirty tables, chairs with crumbs and ketchup on them, and waiting on someone to serve us, bring us a menu or even give a greeting for over ten minutes just made that experience in its entirety a complete disaster.

The sangria was garbage compared to the delicious one I enjoyed at El Torito just days before where I actually got a buzz! Minus one star.  The burger was pretty good. Not super spicy. I actually enjoyed the jalapeno they serve with it.  Here's where they went downhill. The service! By far the worst I've ever had at any restaurant. Once my food was delivered that was it. I was sitting at the bar and I could tell they were busy. I wanted a knife to cut my burger but no one came. I wanted ranch for the fries but no one came. By the time I nearly finished my burger I was finally asked how everything was and had the opportunity to ask for a side of ranch. The ranch came I finished my meal and sat as sauce ran down my fingers because there were no napkins. I had to ask twice!  With all the places there are to dine I won't be coming back here until probably my next birthday.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-escondido?start=20,3.28,3.02,3.16,2.9520000000000004,3.1240000000000006

No problem until my son looked at me and said the entire thing is in Spanish? I looked at it and the menu on the opposite side was in English but the other side was entirely in Spanish. I asked the waitress if she could give us another as he wanted to do the games while we waited. I was told these are the only ones we have. I think here is another business trying so hard to be politically correct without anybody asking them to. Show me where the thousands of complaints came in demanding that they offer a Spanish game section on their menu??? It never happened. I can care less if they offer a menu in every language of every patron but when you run a restaurant  in a country were the majority of the country speaks English the menu should be in English. Another Co catering to 20% of the population and ignoring the other 80%. The best part is that 20% also has never demanded an all Spanish menu. At least offer the menu with the direction written in both languages. What next waitresses that only speak Greek? How about only accept African money.

We waited forever for our food to come out. The waiter asked how I wanted my burger. I told him I didn't want to see any pink but when I took a bite, I saw pink which grossed me out. I only ate half of my burger and finished my fries. I literally got grossed out. After eating, I asked for a refill on my Diet Coke. They don't automatically bring you another drink once they see your glass is empty. We asked for a couple of boxes and a bag. That took forever as well. Service was slow.

He was however always on top of it.

Red Robin is one of those places that somehow gets their burgers to look almost exactly as they are pictured on the menu. I feel like you always get what you order at Red Robin, and that is exactly what happened during our last visit.  They recently expanded the dining room to include more seating, and there is an actual bar area now. The bar is all the way towards the back of the restaurant, so the easiest way to get there is to go in the mall entrance (to the left of the RR entrance) and follow it around until you see the inside mall entrance. We went on a Saturday night, around 6:30 pm, and the wait time was about 30-45 mins. We went around to the bar area, and there were quite a few open seats so we ate in the bar. No wait and full menu. They also have the menu tablets at the table, so you can call the server as soon as you sit down. You can also split your check up and pay on as many credit cards as you want on the tablet, so you don't have to annoy the server by asking him/her to do it for you.    I can't remember a time that I have been disappointed with my order here, because it is always done the way I ask for it. I ordered the Burnin' Love Burger and hubby ordered the Royal Red Robin Burger, and both burgers were perfectly done. One of us ordered the fries as the side and the other ordered the onion rings. Both of our burgers came out perfect. The fries were great as usual, and the onion rings are pretty darn tasty as well. We often order the tower of onion rings, which is always delicious, but we decided to just stick to ordering it as a side for the burger. Just so you know, the onion rings are not bottomless and you really only get about 4-5 small to medium sized onion rings if you order them as the side to your burger.  TIP: If you plan on ordering a burger with bottomless fries, inform the waiter you are doing this in the beginning and ask them if they can get you started on your bottomless fries. I usually order our drinks and then let the waiter know that we want fries too. It is a great appetizer and money saver, since you can have as many fries (they're bottomless) as you want! They also have a lot of sauces to choose from as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-escondido?start=20,3.24,3.06,3.148,3.12,3.1320000000000006

It seemed busy, and it was. We got seated in a crowded area next to a big group that's seated on one side and then a table for 2 on the other side. It was very uncomfortable, it felt like the table with the 2 were a part of our table. I could barely get out of my seat through both sides. That's how close they were. I asked if we could be moved and fortunately they were nice enough to moves us to a booth.  As far as service, the waiter we got was nice, but he seemed too busy for us. We always had to flag him down for something. If I didn't know any better, I'd say he was the only waiter there that day. We didn't have any utensil for the whole visit, got napkins half way through eating our food, and he didn't ask us for refills on our drinks either. My food order was wrong, I got a BLT crossaint sandwich. Ordered the sandwich with no bacon and added cheese to my sandwich. My order came with bacon, turkey slices, lettuce and mayo. No Tomato, and no cheese...and again had to find an opportunity to get a hold of our waiter.

The food was tasty and they had great low price options on the menu. We had the burgers/fries for $6.99 each, and my kids had the chicken strips and mac and cheese from the kids menu. It all tasted fresh; I find that usually when I go out to eat, it's hard to order chicken strips that aren't burnt and super crispy, where they're almost all breading, to the point where they're inedible. Here, they were juicy, and you could actually taste the chicken! And the bottomless fries, who doesn't love that?! They had multiple fruit choices as a side for my kids, they had the tangerine slices. I was actually really impressed with my entire experience. Our server was personable, and she even suggested that my kids grab a balloon on the way out, which we would have had no idea they were there if she didn't offer; I thought that was nice of her (sometimes it's the little things!).

This one is my favorite location because the carpool lane drops us off right in the parking lot of NCF. The other locations (UTC and Temecula), parking is more of a hassle. The food itself is decent for a burger franchise and they have a generous rewards program, where every 10th burger/entree/salad purchase results in you getting a free one on your next visit. Plus a free birthday month burger/salad too. The burgers come with unlimited salad (or fries) and I always substitute iceberg for spring greens and get an additional serving. The main reason for the 5 star review is because of our favorite waitress, Suzy. We've been her customers for a few years now and make it a point to sit in her section every time. The only downside is their main bathroom is always trashed. But they have private bathrooms by the bar area (which also get dirty during busy times). It also can get really crowded during peak dining times. Also, did a takeout which we were told would take 10 minutes and it took half an hour.

Now, I understand not loading the burger up with dressing, but a think I should've be given more than the little ""dot"" I had on my sandwich. Also, our appetizer was just half-heartedly thrown into a container that was either too big or we didn't receive a full order.

My fiancé and I decided to drop by this location in North County mall because we knew it was happy hour and we usually get the half off wings & nachos. We entered the restaurant and waited to be seated. After 15 minutes we were still waiting. We looked around and there was no one around to seat us and the restaurant barely had anyone in there (took pictures to exemplify the emptiness of the place). Another 5 minutes passed by and we walked over to the other side and found someone and asked if they could seat us. She asked if we were over the age of 21 cause she was seating us at the bar area ... ok no problem, we just wanted some wings anyway. Got to our seats and waited some more. The waitress finally came up to us and asked what we wanted to drink, she then said she would be right back. We then continued waiting some more ..... 10 minutes went by (and I only know this because I was on my phone playing a timed game) and a guy came up to us who looked like he was still on break. He didn't even have his apron on but he was nice enough to take our orders. His name was Drew and Drew was the only thing keeping us sane. I'm also pretty sure he wasn't even our server because he worked at the bar. Anyway, our waitress came back and apologized but we informed her we ordered already.  Im not sure if they were short staffed but the service (other than Drew) was the worst I have ever had in any restaurant. I looked around and took some pics of the multiple tables that were dirty and remained untouched for quite some time. I'd say 3/4 of our time spent there and DID we spend some time there. Saw a waitress near the bar just on her phone and I usually don't care what they choose to do during work hours but that place was way too busted to just be on your phone texting this whole time.  Moving on the food! I love Red Robin's wings. But the wings we got were not as crispy as they usually are but that's not a completely big deal breaker to me. (It was the service). We also ordered the trio dessert (cronuts, chocolate covered brownie sticks and Oreo ice cream sundae) which was amazing! Overall, today's visit was terrible.

3,Jennifer S.,"Escondido, CA",416,875,619.0,4.0,2017-12-06,"I actually LOVE Red Robin.  Why do I love a chain restaurant?  Its simple.  That Royal Red Burger is DELICIOUS and I really love their fries.  They are thick cut like mom used to make.  The bottomless part doesn't hurt of course. They've remodeled this location and added a bar area, which is nice because you can skip waiting up front with the throngs of children and head straight to the bar for quick eating.  This has become how we eat at Red Robin! The last couple times we sat at the bar and the bartender served us.  She is great.  It was the same person twice and she's fast and friendly.  The bigger problem is she isn't the one running the food from the kitchen to the table and those people are POKEY.  The burgers coming out takes a while usually and while there are bottomless fries, they give you a 4 year old's handful of fries to start you.  Let me help you out.  ASK FOR MORE AS SOON AS THEY DROP YOUR PLATE OFF!  You'll thank me later.  Even though, you will be lucky if that runner remembers to bring those fries or if you have to appeal to the bartender after you finish your burgers and no one ever returned.  Now, normally I'm pretty flexible but the same thing happened TWICE, so I did include a comment about it on the payment machine when I was done.  I love sitting at the bar, but I don't want to be forgotten! But OTHER than that, I really like Red Robin.  They are usually fairly quick, the staff is generally friendly, and I like all of the food I've had there from fish & chips to burgers to sandwiches, to salads.  GOOD STUFF.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-escondido,2.76,3.12,3.1,,2.9760000000000004
2,Mark A.,"Carlsbad, CA",0,3,,1.0,2017-12-16,"I have personally always enjoyed the food but the service at this location the past couple visits has been horrible! The last time my family and I visited Red Robin in the mall we waited over 45 minutes for our food. I asked the server what was taking do long? She brought back our food 2 minutes later frozen cold. All the plates were sitting there for at least 20 minutes. Our family ended up just leaving.  Today we decided to give Red Robin in the mall a second chance. We had a long day of visiting Santa and shopping for the holidays. The family was hungry and decided to grab a bite to eat. When we got to the front area to reserve a table the staff took our name down for a party of 5. We waited for half hour with 3 young children. We noticed that all the people in front of us were seated, thinking that we would be coming up next. That did not happen. They called the group of people that came after us. We sat and waited until we saw another big group get called up. At this time I approached the hostess and asked why we have not been called. The young girl said she apologizes and that she accidently skipped our group. We proceeded to wait another 20 minutes and then turned around and left.  Our family will not stop going to Red Robin but for sure will never visit this location again. Very pour service! I would not recommend this location to anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-escondido,2.64,3.1,3.088,,2.9160000000000004
1,Stephanie Z.,"Escondido, CA",116,250,383.0,3.0,2017-12-30,"I've come to this location and gotten great service (large party- very attentive to us), I've come to this location and gotten mediocre service and I've come nights like tonight when its far to busy to get good service. Seriously every table was sat and our server could not handle her  tables. We would have to ask for something and by the time it took to deliver a refill or whatever,  2 more at our table were out drinks.  I even got am attitude response from our server tonight which stated ""oh you guys need something else?"" You should of heard her tone. She was clearly overwhelmed! I think Red robin should have a hostess or something going around and doing drink refills or  bottomless fry basket runs to help out the servers during a rush like this. Especially since they give you such a small amount of fries in the basket to share so the server is running back and forth.  The food is amazing but the restaurant should do some changes to help their customers. One thing I did love is that I got to walk the mall during my wait and they text us when our table was ready.  Also,  sign up for royalty rewards and you get a free burger on your birthday!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-escondido,2.64,3.09,3.088,,2.9099999999999997

Our waitress, which we personally requested in our most recent visit, Kit (the gal with the dreads) is awesome! She is personable, hard working and fast with the orders and she even remembered us when we came back. She is just the right amount of fun and business. The Caesar Salad Wrap is the bomb! Despite the most recent visit having a small lack of romaine lettuce, Kit was quick on the draw for a substitute lettuce! My boyfriend's burger was awesome as well and the chili cheese fries appetizer was great~ Highly recommend this spot for either a quick fix, or a nice family meal. And definitely recommend Kit because she is awesome!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-escondido,2.76,3.1,3.096,,2.9640000000000004
