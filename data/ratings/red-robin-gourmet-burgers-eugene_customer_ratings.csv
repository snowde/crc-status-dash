105,Ed M.,"Veneta, OR",0,52,,4.0,2012-03-11,"After seeing the ad on TV for the $6.95 burger and all you can eat fries, we had to visit today.  The burger was cooked nicely, pink in the middle for me and all done for my wife. The kids were happy, one with pizza and fries, the other corn dog and fries.  The staff was very attentive, even for how busy it was.  She was on the spot with more fries when needed and always had a great smile and paid some special attention to the kids.  The smoky fry sauce is wonderful!  Since the atmosphere is active, (people talking, laughing etc) I didn't feel like my kids had to be mimes.  Good visit and will come again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-eugene?start=100,2.448,2.448,2.448,2.448,2.4480000000000004

If you want some yummy greasy food to nurse a hangover, or you just want to indulge in some tasty American cuisine- it's your place! I think I have tried almost every burger here, and they are all yummy in my tummy! I think my favorite would have to be the 'Shroom and Swiss burger or the A1 Peppercorn burger (sans the A1 sauce for me!) The steak fries are bottomless, and I usually get mine extra crispy or with Parmesan Garlic-much better than just the standard ones! The Patty Melt is also delicious, as well as the Chicken Caesar wrap. Really I'm not sure if I have ever had anything here I hated. They make delicious different kinds of lemonades and other specialty drinks that are worth a try. Can get pretty busy on the weekends, so there can be a wait.

109,S M.,"Eugene, OR",72,58,21.0,1.0,2013-09-03,Ok food but worst customer service. The manager had my daughter in tears. Daughter lost some of her money in the game machines and was made to feel bad about it. My daughter is 10 and earns her own money to spend. If the machine takes her money then she should get a refund. The manager told my daughter it was absurd that she would try the machines more than once if they were taking her money. ( She used more than one machine and they DID NOT have out of order signs on them). She was told that they don't own the machines so they can't do anything about refunds. Now that sounds absurd to me. I can't believe they are not smart enough to realize that kids are going to use these machines with the idea that they will work and if they don't they should be able to provide a refund. My wife talked with the manager and she was not apologetic or understanding at all. She asked my wife why my daughter  would use machines that are broken. She would not have used them if they had signs on them. We eat here once a month and I can tell you that we will take our business to another establishment that treats kids as equals.

So with a free meal voucher in hand, on to the updated review...We have been back twice since then, once in late January and once in February. 1st off I didn't speak to the manager as he asked when I arrived, I wanted a real sense of what things were like, not what they were like when they KNEW they were being watched.  I am happy to report that things have changed..WHAT A DIFFERENCE.  I think our waitress's name was Carmel both times (stunning smile, full figured gal, dark hair, and super good at her job).  Not only did we get prompt service, but when you bring in fruity-teenagers with you there can be a lot of requests.  She did sooooooo well with all the requests.   The second visit with just my fiance was even better (no kids LOL).  We were getting ready to order and asked Carmel's (???) opinion.  She was upfront about what she recommended and, even better yet, she was spot-on.  The new burgers they have, the one with the arugula and the one with blue cheese and portabello mushrooms were to die for.  And who can pass up on garlic fries!!!  She even brought us 1 of EVERY fry sauce so we could try them. OK Red Robin, you have redeemed yourselves.  Thank you for gracious opportunity to try you guys again!   On a side note...if you are going in around September-ish...be patient (and prepared) it will be likely that some poor new kid is still learning the ropes ;-)  With that knowledge, I WILL be back and be much more forgiving!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-eugene?start=60,3.12,3.12,3.12,2.128,3.1200000000000006

80,Crystal R.,"Eugene, OR",3,12,11.0,4.0,2014-12-02,"Overall it's good but a bit over priced.  Seated immediately, helped quickly. Got a Freckled Lemonade which is a way overpriced, glorified Strawberry Lemonade. Still pretty tasty! I like that they had a smaller onion ring tower because there was just two of us, not hungry enough for a full tower (or even my whole meal for that matter) but the onion ring tower is kinda their thing so I recommend it. Everytime I come here the onion rings are perfect, but this time some of them were a little burnt, however still edible. The campfire sauce with it is yummy. Our server Michael was really friendly and definitely a hard worker. He delt with my substitutions with no issue.  I ordered the Guacamole burger. I substituted for the jalapeño bun, arugula and pepper jack cheese. The bacon was perfect. The patty was perfect. I ordered it a little more pink than it came, but it was almost spot on and ended up being really good.  The jalapeño bun wasn't as spicy as I expected but I really wasn't sure what to expect. Overall an awesome burger, but it would of been nice if it were a bit smaller. Just a nit picky thing though. I ordered a salad with my burger. It wasn't amazing or anything, just a basic salad. The bleu cheese was real bleu cheese though, other places tend to have a dressing that seems like ranch with a few bleu cheese crumbles. My partner's burger was really good. You could definitely taste the flame-broiled taste of the ""Big Tavern"". It kinda reminded me of Burger King to be honest, but he loved it so I'm sure it must of been better. The restaurant was pretty mellow this time, it can get pretty loud on occasion. Everyone has always been really friendly. They do a special birthday song for birthdays and even a few dessert I believe. Bottom-less fries too! I will go back, mostly because I live nearby but if it was on the other side of town, I can't imagine driving too far to go there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-eugene?start=80,2.56,2.56,2.56,2.256,2.56

The most unappetizing feature of our visit was the very sticky table and the filthy highchair that they brought out for our kid.

64,Laura O.,"Florence, OR",2,9,2.0,2.0,2015-07-23,"Red Robin used to be a happy welcoming place with  comfort food that usually hit the spot. Yesterday proved Red Robin is no longer that place. My husband, nearly 2-year-old and I arrived before the dinner rush and were immediately seated. We had a busy day in Eugene and wanted to eat before the hour drive home. Our server was a young women with resting bitch face and a fake smile. We asked for some bottomless fries because we would order some burgers and my daughter would love to snack on them while we choose and ordered and waited. Resting Bitch Face (RBF) essentially told us that the fries could not be served before the meal, and that they were only bottomless for the one diner, and if we intended to share they would not be bottomless. I was appalled that sharing what would likely be 6 French fries with a nearly 2 year old was not allowed in this ""family"" restaurant. RBF suggested we order a children's meal for her and she could have French fries with it..... Oh yes, please serve my 1 year old a whole hamburger-that makes sense. Ultimately we ordered a whole side of fries so we could give her something to snack on while our food was prepared and enjoy what used to be the ""bottomless fries"" this restaurant was known for. We normally get a strawberry lemonade to share, but we wanted to try some new purple pear lemonade drink, which was served warm with ice, which was odd. We switched back to regular strawberry lemonade, which is no longer served with lots of delicious sugary strawberries, but only one frozen one, with some watered down lemon water. Sad sad these Red Robin staples are disappointments now. I ordered chicken strips with Mac n cheese to share with the little one. It was advertised as a new favorite on the menu. The ""Clucks"" we're good, but the Mac n cheese was nothing more than noodles with cheddar cheese melted on top. Disappointing for a restaurant known for comfort food. Overall our RBF server was slow, rude and did not represent what used to be a family restaurant.  We get the impression red robin is trying to become more of a high end bar food scene.

It was actually kind of awkward. We eventually thought maybe it was seat your self, so we did! We sat down and the hostess kinda of abruptly came up and said 'here's your menus' in a rude way and walked away. Kinda like she was mad we didn't wait for her..but we did and no one came so we took it upon ourselves to sit down. Then our waitress comes and takes our order. We ordered our appetizers and drinks and food at the same time. We got our drinks and appetizers about ten minutes later and everything was really good (so far).. We finished our appetizers and kept waiting for a good 35 minutes for our three burgers and bottomless fries.. After waiting for 35 minutes our waiter came and said 'they somehow lost your order slip' and he was very sorry and that we can get free dessert. Ok that's fine. So we wait another 25 minutes and we get our burgers. The fried were cold and not good and the burgers seemed to be slapped together. At this point I was over the whole thing. I didn't want dessert. I just wanted to leave. I think the waiter saw my disappointment and came back and said that they were going to take off our appetizers from the total instead of dessert, which was awesome but the whole experience was just not up to par.

We wanted to sit in the bar because we didn't want a full meal.  Mara was the bartender and she did good. We just wanted a couple appetizers and a side salad for me. She took our order, noting I didn't want tomatoes on my salad, which was made correctly.  She checked on us regularly, being my husband was apparently dehydrated and drank 4 large glasses of water, so she was constantly refilling it for him.  The food was good. We had mozzarella sticks, fried zucchini and voodoo fries, along with my side salad. My salad was ordered without tomatoes and made correctly.  My only real complaint was the fries touted a ghost pepper sauce on it with jalapeños. It wasn't hot at all. Not sure why, but I expected better in terms of that part. I fully expected my sinuses to be cleared out and a tear or two. Honestly, I've had Chinese hot mustard that did better in terms of fire.  They have (along with every other restaurant these days) those stupid kiosk/iPad looking things to order appetizers and desserts on. You can play games on it and pay for your check as well. I despise these things because it's simply an excuse for a waitress to be lazy, and only do half their job, so I refuse to use them. If I am going to use it, I want to order everything that way and just have an expediter bring it to me. Not half of it there and half through a waitress. The other thing that irritates me with this system is when you're using it to pay the bill, it automatically suggests leaving a 20% tip. If I'm using that bullshit thing, I'm not about to leave 20%, when they've only find half their job!

Just a heads up... You unfortunately cannot put in an app order until your server has put in your first drink order.... we learned this after about 7 minutes of trying to figure out why we couldn't order it! I have had good luck with their regular fries (unlike the sweet potato fries).  They have always been warm and well seasoned.  If you are looking for something new to try, try the cookie shake and ask them to add Bailey's Irish Cream to it, it is DELICIOUS.  Also try their campfire dipping sauce, it comes with their onion rings but is also great for fries.  This restaurant has definitely become one of my favorites when I am in the mood for a well made burger.

31,Jake C.,"Junction City, OR",6,90,8.0,4.0,2016-03-26,"My family and I have been to Red Robin many, many times. The ambiance and the food are usually pretty good. I was there recently with a party of 10 (two children 2 and younger) on a Friday night. We were going to start dinner at 6pm, so my folks got there at 5:45pm and went to reserve us a table. When my portion of the family got there at 5:55pm, the place was starting to get a little busy, but there were open tables all over still. Since there were 6 of us there, I assumed we would be given a table, but we continued to wait while people walking in with groups of 5-8 were being seated as soon as they arrived. I thought that was strange. When the last of our party arrived around 6:05pm, we continued to wait while more groups of 1-7 were seated who had just walked in. I'm not sure I understand why people who have been waiting for 20 minutes couldn't have gotten two tables pushed together (which is what RR eventually did) to get the majority of us seated before the walk-ins. Around 6:20pm we were finally seated. Our waiter was Barryington (I may not have it spelled correctly). He was awesome. High energy. Was busy but still checked on us. Talked to my kids about Dragonball Z (a cartoon -- actually another employee came over and talked to my kids about it too. They enjoyed that.). We got appetizers and they arrived fairly quickly. So we didn't notice how long the rest of the food took (which wasn't really that long considering how busy it ended up being). There was the NCAA tournament games on the TV next to us. Food was good. We got refills on fries a couple times across the table. That's one of the main reasons we go there. The real star was Barryington. Many employees I've noticed can get beat down, lose their energy, and trudge along through the shift. That never happened with him and I am more likely to return (I would go back for the food anyway -- but I am MORE likely to return again sooner) thanks to employees like him. Now if the front desk can just figure out how to get a group a table when there are plenty open in less than 40 minutes, that would be worth another star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-eugene?start=20,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.512,2.48

Because they are understaffed...at 5pm on a Saturday night...with the NCAA track and field championships in town... Here's a suggestion from an experienced manager: either learn how to staff properly, or fill the front of house first so nobody can see that there are so many empty tables.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-eugene?start=20,2.32,2.32,2.32,2.408,2.32

58,Tess B.,"Eugene, OR",253,10,,1.0,2016-06-25,"I was there with a big group tonight and we had potentially the worst service I have ever had in a restaurant. Not only did it take a long time for the food, but some of us had already been there for over an hour before we got our food, and when the food came out the chicken was still frozen. The servers avoided us and made no effort to fix anything or even explain to us why we had been sitting there for an hour without our food. The weird thing was that half our group got their food right away and by the time the other half started to get their food the first half had long since finished their food and paid their bill. When it was time for those of us who waited an hour for our food to cash out none of the servers helped us or offered to print checks or cash us out, so a big group of us all had to use this self-serve credit card machine. There was just a huge lack of any server caring that people hadn't gotten their food and we were never approached by a manager the whole time. Unfortunate! On top of all this the staff made it very clear that they were not happy that a big group of us came in, but they don't accept reservations so I don't know what they expect on a Saturday night. I've never had it made so clear to me that the workers at a restaurant did not want us there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-eugene?start=40,2.36,2.36,2.36,2.244,2.36

I like the many choices of burgers available. However most of the burgers taste about the same. The burgers seem fresh but portion is a bit small. The fries are very good but the portion is small.

46,Mootsie B.,"Springfield, OR",0,11,,2.0,2016-10-05,"Red Robin has gone to shit. They have pretty good food as always, but there is a very clear loss of service at this location. When I was last there, there was one busser for the whole restaurant so there were tons of empty tables, but the hostesses just stood around and chatted rather than helping out so tons of people were forced to wait up to 20 minutes to be seated. As we were waiting for our food, we could hear waiters airing their dirty laundry saying that one person quit, they were frustrated, etc. There was one manager there who was waitressing and clearly not paying attention to what her staff was doing.  And, what was perhaps even more irritating, the portions have gotten even smaller and the prices have gone up again.  I wouldn't patronize this restaurant since it doesn't care about customer service and has gone crazy with their pricing. I'd support a small, independent restaurant before I'd go to Red Robbin yo money again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-eugene?start=40,2.6,2.6,2.6,2.2800000000000002,2.6
29,Taniqua P.,"Junction City, OR",102,14,4.0,2.0,2016-10-10,"First the positive: Our server was overall great! Burgers were GREAT! FREE birthday burger that is enough for two meals! We paid about $20 for a cocktail, a beer and a desert (although we tipped on the pre-discount amount. NEVER forget to take care of a good server!) We consider that a DEAL!! Thanks... Areas that could improve. the beer took forever, I order my cocktail about 10 mins after we ordered the beer and food and beer and I got my drink before his :( We ordered upgraded fried for each burger (we assumed we'd pay for the upgrades on our Bday burgers, but no. Very cool!)  I ordered the smores fries and my husband ordered the garlic something fries, they were both pretty awesome! The menu says fries are unlimited and when we upgrade to sweet potato fries, they are in fact unlimited. We had no reason to believe that our fries were not, and we were not informed that the two options we picked are not refillable at the time of order.  Also my fries were cool at best, the hot fudge was not even warm, still globby. Under the assumption of refillable fries, I just ate my burger first. I waited to order a hot round until I was actually ready to dive in with undivided attention. I tried that and was informed that I could not get a refill and not offered replacement of the cold fries.  Overall, the burgers and upgrades to the burgers were free! A $50 meal for $20 before tip,  However, getting lesser service because it's free doesn't seem right either (nor do I think that was the cause of the issues.) It's a bummer because service is hit and miss here. The food is awesome but we have had horrible service in the past and FANTASTIC service before. And Friday,  pretty good service but some bumps. We LOVE Red Robin and the food is ALWAYS good. Just service issues like wait time on food, more than one occasion of cold food and things coming out of order like appetizers before drinks and even after the meal has arrived on more than one occasion.

The menu was extensive and in places, a little confusing. Pub menu? Regular menu?  We all ended up ordering from the regular menu ( I think).... In the meantime, the fries began to arrive and they were pretty good...the basket of fries nearest me was not terribly hot..therefore not as crisp as I would like. Other baskets on the table proved to be hot and crispy. Sprinkled with that signature seasoning they provide...extra yummy.  The food arrived after a slightly lengthy period of time but was worth the wait. I had the shroom burger and it was just what it should have been...cheesy and shroomy, burger cooked pink....not many places give you the ""pink"" option anymore. So the place was only half full and the service wasn't the speediest, but they were so pleasant and friendly that I'm willing to overlook the not-so-speedy service.  One other small criticism would be the touch screen units on the tables. I don't want to enter my order on a potentially bacteria ridden electronic something or other on my table. Thank goodness I didn't have to - they were happy to take our order the old fashioned way.  Plus its nice to get away from electronic devices for an hour or so. But that's just me...

32,Kathleen d.,"Redding, CA",6,5,,2.0,2017-08-29,"We've been huge fans of Red Robin for years, disappointed the last couple of times ,Just not the same. Then ordered online WOW, place was empty for Friday night so I was pretty surprised when I got all the way home to find a entire meal missing. I had to go back after calling, so  I spent an hour basically going back and forth , pretty mad to find instead of making a fresh sandwich they gave me the meal they had forgotten. Nothing like a cold dinner. This is the 4th time it's happened, I know Red Robin is a huge corporation and opening new restaurants daily but if the way I was disrespected by the manager is any indication of how they'll do business, they won't survive.  At least for my family.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-eugene?start=20,2.56,2.67,2.67,,2.6260000000000003

2,Jason C.,"Eugene, OR",17,55,,2.0,2017-09-30,"Red Robbins has a good atmosphere. However, my partner and I consistently never get refills on French fries. Usually, we initially receive about 6 fries each, and sometimes we are offered more after we have already paid and about to leave. It is especially frustrating, considering ""the bottomless fries"" is heavily advertised in your commercials. We will try Red Robbins again, but we have our doubts.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-eugene,2.76,2.66,2.66,,2.7

4,Kambria G.,"Springfield, OR",81,173,23.0,2.0,2017-10-19,"Very mediocre food and staff. My husband hates coming here, so we only come when invited when someone is having a birthday. Their ""tavern"" burgers aren't good at all, worth it to get their more expensive burgers. Only reason I get excited about Red Robin is because you can have endless sweet potato fries or fruit (or other choices). The last time we came (a couple weeks ago) the service was painfully slow. We came around 1 and had a party of 5 and we were all kind of in a hurry to get back to working and it took over 2 hours because anytime we asked for anything it took 20 min (example:our order, fix mistakes on the food, another basket of fries, check, cash out the check, mess up on the check etc.) I believe she was in training but still, if someone is in training they should only have 1 table, 2 at the most.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-eugene,2.84,2.63,2.63,,2.7139999999999995

After asking my server if the food I was ordering had Tobasco or Texas Pete in it, I was told that shes not a doctor or nurse and cant tell me that kind of thing. After her explaination of her career choices, I was offered an allergy menu.  Neither item on on their allergy questionnaire on their tablet.  I asked them to just ask the cook.  My server came back with someone, who did not introduce themselves, so I can only assume was their manager.  He told me that they could not divulge that information.  Mind you, during this entire time, we asked for water mutiple times.  I cant contest to the food because of fear of ending up in the hospital.  Very disappointed!

Then a group who came in 30 minutes after us is sat and when we ask they say they were here before you, but we watched them walk in 30 minutes after us. So we asked again how long then and the hostess tells us we don't see a table opening anytime soon. This is some of the worst service I have ever seen. I will definitely not be back to this location.

0,Natalie H.,"Lake Oswego, OR",5,19,2.0,3.0,2017-11-11,"This is a good restaurant for kids, they enjoy it.  The sloppy, uncaring service was a big No for the ones paying the bill, undeserving of it's lackluster 3-star rating.   Took the grandkids here for a special birthday, and the kids had a grand time.  They loved the multiple choices on the kids meal, loved the bottomless steak fries, were thrilled with the singing birthday sundae. We adults didn't enjoy it much.  It was a constant search to find our server, much less get his attention.  We had to beg for more fries, we ordered an appetizer that never came, they brought the singing birthday sundae without notice or prior dessert order, so the other child at the table felt left out until they finally brought one for her.  On the bright side, his IPA and my gourmet burger were fabulous! We went early to ease their accommodation of my service dog. While we try to accept the seating assignment if at all possible, the hostess tried to seat us at multiple inappropriate tables, where my dog couldn't tuck in, and would be tripped over/in heightened distress during the meal.  I finally had to point out and insist on an appropriate booth, where she could tuck herself away in comfort.  Training, please!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-eugene,2.68,2.58,2.58,,2.62

The food is almost always great...I get the same thing every time...The Whiskey River BBQ Chicken Wrap with fries. I will not give 4 or 5 stars because this restaurant smells like dirty mop water EVERY TIME I have been there. There is an all-around dirty vibe about the place if you ask me. I worked in restaurants for about 5 years so I know what restaurant dirty mop water smells like. Maybe I am overly sensitive to smells but surely I can't be the only person that notices it. I have to block out the smell so I can enjoy my food which is yummy. So, besides the lack of proper cleaning, the place is OK.

When I asked the waitress to bring out my bottomless fries out first, she said in the rudest town of voice ""we don't bring out fries until you order"" when I always do. She was visibly irritated and reflected that towards her costumers. Little to no service, no spoons for the root beer float we ordered and she acted like it was really difficult to get. Just a super negative experience when it was supposed to be a nice, family dinner to celebrate my brothers birthday. It was in the bar area and it was a blonde hair chick.

13,Camille F.,"Springfield, OR",0,6,,1.0,2018-01-02,"Horrific experience that I am still dealing with as I write!  Placed a to-go order at 4:30 tonight, lady was super pleasant relayed my order back to me and it was correct and it would be ready in 15 minutes. Loaded up kids and headed out, and when I walked in I was told by the hostess the carry out gal would be right up. I stood there for 10 minutes waiting so now 4:48(food should be done) when she showed up she said they were out of the kids meatballs I ordered so I asked why no one called me-they took my number when I placed the order.  She said the girl who took my order didn't write it down.  After waiting another 15 minutes to cook something else for my kiddo, the gal came up to me and said it was almost ready. I told her I would like to speak to a manager about getting some sort of discount for the inconvenience and the fact that my other food would now be cold.  The manager offered me a shake or a dessert for their mistake, she said that they don't take that to go orders they have a call center and that was the reason for the mishap.  I waited another 15 minutes for them to plate up my dessert, finally leaving at 5:15.  I used a $50 card to pay for the $30.34 and didn't leave a tip,  and when I went to use the gift card at another place there was $6.07 missing which funny enough is exactly 20%.  When I called the pre-paid credit card company there was a transaction on there for $36.41 at exactly the same time I was at Red Robin.  I called and spoke with the same manager that offered the dessert, and she said the transaction on their end still read $30.34. She said she would get to me by 8pm when she cashed out the carry out server, but didn't call till 10:30pm, and left a message to call back tomorrow.  After three days of checking the card balance I finally saw where the tip was reimbursed to me, however as a former manager of a restaurant this was not the outcome I expected or the service I would have given myself.  Sloppy, rude and completely unprofessional-will never ever go back despite my extreme addiction action to the Blue Ribbon burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-eugene,2.52,2.5,2.5,,2.508
