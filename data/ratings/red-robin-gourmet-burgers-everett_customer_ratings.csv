165,Charlene S.,"Lynnwood, WA",0,23,8.0,1.0,2012-05-24,"I love Red Robin. The burgers are great, never had a dish I didnt like, for a chain, it isnt bad, not 5 star quality, but a good way to cure your hunger. HOWEVER, the only beef I have is with this location in Everett.  I have only been here a few times and that was enough. The last time I came here with my bf, we saw about 3 different waitresses. Each came to our table, asked us the same questions. Of course this isnt a bad thing, just a mix up, but my god, how rude the employees are here. I dont expect much but at least look me in the eye a few times. Also, when our drinks arrived, about 5 mins later, another waitress also came up with drinks(cokes) but when she realized that we had just received a couple cokes, which were still very full, instead of taking them back, she put them on our table and left them there. So we got to enjoy watching 2 full cokes get watered down on our table, as we drank the ones we already had...we looked  like we were super thirtsy and couldnt wait for a refill, we had to have to refills NOW.  What made up for all that, was the food was still great, so after we ate, we pretty much forgot about the rudeness and the double coke disaster and called it good. When my bf checked his credit statement, the waitress double charged his tip. We gave her 10, and he was charged for 20.  Red Robin still have us as customers, however, not at this location. Considering we havent been here in a while, things might have changed, but I am not going to risk it. Make the trip to Lynnwood.

It was until I heard the floor manager clapping his hands extremely loud and extremely rudely in the drink pit next to the booth I was sitting in with my friend.

Our waitress, Meagan, was absolutely amazing and funny and she made me want to only go to this location until this floor manager, Gary came into the picture. Wouldn't be mad but he saw us talking to the girls in the drink pit about what just happened and we said we were sorry that happened and they were so nice and apologetic about this rude manager. He proceeded to come over to our table and ask if everything is good in such a way that it was obviously his way to try to intimidate us into not complaining or just shutting up.

134,Sherry B.,"Lynnwood, WA",65,14,8.0,4.0,2013-01-05,"Red Robin is within walking distance for us so it's a favorite haunt for happy hour when Guinness (and other tap beers) are half off! I'm totally in love with their Burning Love burger and the endless fries don't hurt, either. Last night we tried the fried zucchini and it was delish... but the batter would probably have stayed on better if they dried the slices a bit before breading. As it was they were a little hard to eat. We usually are there for Happy Hour so we like to sit in the bar where there is typically no waiting (your mileage may vary on Fridays and Weekends) and the staff in the bar area is super attentive. I can't really speak for table service in other areas. The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is they (annoyingly) still cater to the birthday song crowd, thus a good time may occasionally be punctuated by off-key singing and screaming children running around; and while that isn't really the fault of staff... it can detract from the atmosphere.  My advice... go late... sit in the bar... and it's all FIVES! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-everett?start=120,3.56,3.56,3.56,2.7359999999999998,3.5600000000000005

I expected crowds but it was empty. We were seated promptly but the extra flap they lifted at the end to make room for the high chair was tilted. In fact, both our tables had a tilt and we spent most the meal trying to catch crayons, toy cars (the baby doesn't go anywhere without his Lightning McQueen and Mater car) and even drinks and food from careening off their edges.  Our waiter was distracted and distant. He did not clear empty cups off the table even after bringing refills. Thus our table cluttered up immediately, especially since a wide swath had to be cleared in front of the toddler to avoid messes. We ordered onion rings and fried zucchini to keep the kids happy until their meals arrived. Both were undercooked, particularly the zucchini which was very crunchy. The onion ring batter was good, but the onion itself was really thick and hard to chew. Our food came and it was meh. I think we might have been spoiled by Blazing Onion. I had the Blu Ribbon burger. It was ok, but bun was untoasted (pet peeve) and the onion strings were underdone resulting in a shoelace like texture and appearance with every bite. Bleh. Husband's burger was mediocre as well. Two kids had pizza, two had chicken strips. Chicken seemed fine, but the pizza was abysmal. Cheese was super thick and not hot enough.

It has bacon,cheese, lettuce, and pickles in addition to its 1/2 lb angus beef patty. Priced around $14 it's definitely more than I typically pay for a burger but well worth it. I add grilled onions to mine and ask for an extra sauce (it comes with it's own sauce on the side, not sure what it is but MAKES this burger). So since this discovery I have purposefully come here just to get my burger fix, I actually find myself luring others in to coming with me so they can share in my new discovery.

When I asked for a GF menu, our server surprised me with an iPad allowing me to explore my options (and they had so many more options than most restaurants!). I was thrilled at the thought of having fries. GF fries! Oh baby, that was going to be my entree. No other place I've been to makes their fries separately from the gluten contaminated foods.  In fact, I was so eager that I opted for the ""lettuce bun"" for my sandwich instead of the GF bun just so I could have room for bottomless fries :)  (No pic of the food. I dove in too fast and don't touch my ph once I start eating) Aside from the delightful fries which were perfectly hot and crisp, I had the California chicken sandwich.  A wonderful side.  The chicken was juicy, the bacon was thick and cooked to that just-right mid-range of a little crispy and a little soft. The iceberg lettuce was stacked a bit thickly but was easy enough to peel away to my preference.  Our visit was a Sat nite and the place was packed but we had no problem getting an immediate seat in the bar section. And prompt service! Our server was great (sorry I'm poor with names). He was friendly and checked on us frequently. That was especially nice given the busy-ness of the night. The sign of good staffing? I think so! Our drinks were nummy too.  I had a type of berry margarita and my friend had a summer beer that she liked enough to order again ;)  Next time I'm in town I'll gladly revisit!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-everett?start=60,2.84,2.84,2.84,2.036,2.84

Although we were the 2nd couple in line when it opened at 11:00 AM, we were still seated by the kitchen (maybe because we had a 2 yr. old with us?). When I asked why, she told me this was the only section open. Our server, Ian, came to take our order immediately after we sat down,,,,,again and again and again! I finally  said ""could we look at the menu first?"". I ordered the Banzai burger and he said ""fries, soup or salad""? Since I knew my partner was getting the fries, I ordered the soup. After getting our food I was extremely disappointed in that I couldn't even tell what kind of burger it was; it clearly had pineapple on it but I couldn't taste it and it clearly had cheddar on it but I couldn't taste that either. Don't know if it had teriyaki on it  'cause I couldn't taste or see that either. Ian kept coming over and asking if we were ready for our bill and since we had just started eating I said ""In a bit"", he brought it over anyways and imagine my surprise when I was charged for the soup! When I questioned him about it, he said ""Oh yeah, soup is extra"". Never did he come back to ask how the food was, if we needed a refill or if we wanted dessert. Clearly, this was a man in a hurry. For what I don't know as there were only 2 other tables in his section, (granted one of the tables was quite large) . So now I remember WHY I stopped going to Red Robin 5 years ago (even though they are across the street from where I work). Lousy food and lousy service!

But I don't know if they have new staff, or bad management, but my experience was SO bad, that I left zero dollars as tip, spoke to the manager about my issues and still had more issues after that!  #1: When we walked in the door, there was no host waiting to seat us. There's a clear sign that says ""Wait to be seated,"" so we did. No host to be seen. Lots of waiters and other people walked past us in the distance, even gave us eye contact, but no one came over to seat us. We waited almost 5 minutes, and then I got upset and went over to the bar next to the waiting area and loudly asked ""can someone help seat us?"" I was very frustrated. So soon after that, a lady came and sat us down with the manager. The manager made no acknowledgement or apology about the long wait for us to be seated. So I calmly asked him, ""is it customary to make all of your guests wait so long to be seated,"" of which he seemed to be completely in shock that we waited at all. He then apologized for the experience of waiting and offered a free appetizer. He gave us our menus and came back less than a minute later, frantically wanting to take our order. Um....I don't even think I really had time to look at the menu. So we quickly ordered.  #2: I ordered a burger with no shoe string onions (clearly taken by the manager who helped us) and my burger comes out with shoestring onions. I was upset, because the manager took my order wrong! So they took it back and brought me one without the onions and apologized.  #3: We never even got our ""complimentary"" appetizer the manager promised us, until after our meals and I asked where our appetizer was. The waitress who finished serving us (because the manager was no where in site, or apparently had left for the day was gone) looked completely unaware that there was an appetizer at all.  Epic fail Red Robin.

They brought out some fries immediately (before we ordered) because some of the little kids said they were hungry, on the assumption that at least one person in our group would order a meal with the unlimited fries. Very cool. And the waitress even squirted ketchup on the plate for the 3 year old when the adults nearby had their hands full.

No more garlic fries! They have a garlic seasoning (extra charge). Not the same. Very disappointed. Bacon is cold even though I've tried to ask for it hot or extra crispy.

I don't know but since I love the gourmet burger options, great! We wanted to eat and then head over to Regal for the Kingsman, good movie I thought. We needed to hurry, ordered an app, the 7 pc. boneless buffalo wings, kind of small in size. Our server, a young blonde guy, who was self-effacing about his weight, was very responsive. Since we had the app, we weren't really hungry so we decided to order an avocado burger with the avocado on the side, no tomato, with the sandwich cut up to split. It seemed a little packed on this Saturday, with others enjoying the VD as we were, food took awhile. The server, sensing our growing frustration at either having to miss the food or the movie, spoke to a manager, who came over and made sure that our food was rushed and brought to us asap. He was standing there when we got our food, which had the tomato on it (I'm alergic), and was not cut... When our server, I think his name was Brian, brought the check, he alerted us that the burger and fries were comped by the manager.  Lunch for $5.65. The server got a nice tip:-) I rate the cooks service a three, the server a 5, the manager a 5, an average of a 4.3 Bon apetit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-everett?start=120,1.72,1.72,1.72,2.032,1.7200000000000002

We eat here about once a month,  sometimes more often. Yesterday was probably our last time there since the food was absolutely terrible,  perfectly matching the service.   It took a very long time for our server to greet us and get our drink order, so long in fact that we were ready to order our meals. We ordered an appetizer to come before the meal,  it arrived 25 minutes later, our meals arrived 30 minutes after that. 4 of the 5 meals arrived but the fifth never came out, we actually had to flag down the server to ask if it was coming,  she told us she needed to put in a new order.  That was my 12 year old sons food so I  shared with him since he only wanted French fries.  His order finally came to the table when we were ready to leave. All the other meals were delivered to the table cold,  without any of the sauces that were ordered, and they looked as if they had been thrown together or dropped and re-plated. The sweet potato fries were burned and hard, not edible. The waitstaff that was assisting our server were totally rude,  yelling back and forth about the table numbers and whose order went to which table, it was very immature and obnoxious.  It was a really unpleasant dining experience. We spent $90 for food that was worth maybe $30 at a drive through. Since the quality of food has deteriorated over the last 6 months we won't be back to this location.

I knew that coming in it would be pretty busy but that I could always sit in the bar with my friend. We found a table behind the bar really quickly, I figured we were really lucky.  We ordered drinks first, I wanted to try a new drink a Pear-tini they advertised, I thought I would step out of my usual drink for once and try something new. The drink came quickly but tasted nothing like pear, can't quiet put a finger on it but it wasn't for me and hey that is what I get for trying a new drink. I asked if I could order my regular vodka, redbull. When that arrived it tasted like mint, (funny thing when I asked for a different drink after the pear-tini the waitress asked if it tasted minty) I didn't want to be a jerk and just figured I would deal with it.  Then we ordered food, gourmet cheddar cheese burger, NO PICKLES, and the garlic fries with seasoning. My friend ordered onion rings and a double tavern (nacho). Food came out and My burger had onion rings, and pickles, and my buddies had regular fries. The waiter that came to bring us food I told them that the rings were hers and asked if I could get the garlic fries I ordered. He said sure. Then another waiter came by about 20 min later and I caught her attention and asked for the fries, she said of course shed get them ordered right now. Then our regular waitress came by and I asked about my fries and she said she would check, and ended up reordering them. We finished our food, we waited about another 30 min after we finished our food, no fries yet. I asked for my check.  SO food was wrong, drink was crap, and never got fries...

I have never had a good experience here, but today was the worst experience.  We were told the wait would be 10-15 min, after 40 we got our table. It took another 20 to put our orders in and once our food came out some time later (understandable for the wait) we only got half our food. Once the other half arrived, half the table was done eating and the fresh food wasn't hot. One of the dishes was incorrect which delayed it even more and caused their food to sit and get cold while waiting for a new bottom bun. We also never received refills until we were done eating... For a Wednesday night and an arrival time of 5:45, I just didn't expect it to take so long. Our party was an average size of 4 adults and 2 kids.

I had been to this place twice before in the year since I moved to this area. After the second time I decided not to return. Today I decided to give them another shot, my sister was in town and she usually enjoys their food. This was a typical day at this location, which isn't good news. We were seated in view of the kitchen, and were able to view first hand the reason our burgers came to us room temperature. Both burgers sat under the heat lamp for at least fifteen minutes, probably more. Unappetizing as he'll. To make things worse, when the manager came by at the end to ask how it was, she couldn't accept ""no, just let us pay and get out of here"" as an answer, despite the fact I kept repeating it OVER AND OVER. She just prattled on ENDLESSLY with stuff like ""I can have them make another, maybe a different burger would be more to your liking"" and what have you. The only reason I told her in the first place was to be a nice guy, but now my patience was growing thin. Told her I needed to go (yet again). Now she starts asking me what I had to do that day after I left. I kid you not. I had more than enough at that point, told her that I didn't know what I was doing later, but it would be better than this. PLEASE GO. That pretty much sums up my trip to red robin today, do yourself a favor and drive over to the alderwood or Smokey point location if somebody else's ten dollar cheeseburger won't do.

I got seated quicker than the quoted wait for the main dining area and had my beverages super fast, but it took forever for the food to come. The whole section I was sitting in was people with beverages only who waited a long time for food. It appeared many of the servers were standing in the kitchen area waiting for their food orders to come up. The table next to us was lucky enough to get some fries ahead of time, but we had not realized this was something we should request in advance. Food eventually came and was delicious.  I love the customizability of the food here. I am huge fan of the nutrition calculator on the website. I was hoping to have this kind of maneuverability on the new table machines, but seems you can only order appetizers, desserts and drinks from this. I was also disturbed to learn that the machine offers games which could have helped me pass the very long wait, but they require an additional charge of 1.99$ which is then added to your bill. It seems very easy to click on this and end up paying which I am sure could upset some parents with curious children. I did appreciate it had a few free features, the ability to join the rewards program and a faster way to pay.  A manager was nice enough to stop by and apologize for the wait on more than one occasion. I also was able to get 2 refills of broccoli which can be exchanged for the never ending fries. Our server was highly attentive and made sure we had a lot of refills and also kept us informed on the wait. I love that you can sub a boca burger to any sandwich here and will continue to frequent but may wait til the remodel is completed and its less hectic.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-everett,1.88,2.35,2.35,2.1879999999999997,2.1620000000000004

The wait times both times were longer than at other Red Robin's. The first time we were stuck in a back corner surrounded by big parties and received lousy service (one of the reasons being our waiter was socializing with some of the patrons). Both times the staff (all of them) seemed disorganized and all over the place. The entrance/waiting area is dirty and there isn't an official check in area. The food was okay the first time. But the 2nd time it was horrible and it took us an HOUR to get our food. My chicken sandwich had maybe a teaspoon of guacamole. The gluten free bun was dry like I was eating sawdust (apparently they use the worst gluten free buns ever...Udi's multi-grain!). The chicken breast was dry and was really small. I managed to flag down our waiter and get some guacamole, so I could try and eat the damn sandwich. My sweet potato fries were cold. My hubby tried one of their new burgers but it was incredibly dry and overcooked. He loved the sauces on it, but it couldn't save the fact he was he eating a hockey puck. The staff kept running around like crazy the whole time we were there and our waiter and a manager apologized for the wait saying it's not usually this busy on a Tuesday.

I went to RR for lunch yesterday with a friend of mine and his son. My friend's son has life threatening food allergies so when we placed our order he mentioned his allergies and was very clear what he needed to NOT be on his burger. It was also his birthday so he presented his birthday burger coupon to the server and was told she would get it when we were ready to cash out. When our food finally arrived of course there was a big pile of mayo on my friend's son's burger. He reminded our server that he couldn't have that. She was nice and apologetic, and immediately took it back to get a new burger. And then we waited and waited. The manager came out and apologized for the mistake, but made no mention of the time it was taking to get the new burger out. Of course everyone at the table felt bad eating, but our food was getting cold. The burger finally came out - 30 minutes later. No offer to bring the kid more fries while he waited. No offer to comp the onion rings we ordered. No anything.  Finally when we were ready to pay the bill our server forgot to remove the burger for his birthday. And when we tried to cash out with the tablet, it wouldn't let us split the check. We called the server and she couldn't figure it out so she rang everything up on her own. And she didn't get stuff split up correctly, but at this point I didn't even care. I just wanted to get out of there.  The remodel is OK. At least the tables and booths aren't sticky, but I assume given time it will be as dirty and grimy as it was before the remodel. It seems every time I leave a Red Robin I tell myself I'm not going back. And then several months go by and I return and the experience reminds me again that I don't want to come back.

The server said, ""It's all day happy hour."" To which I got a slightly confused look on my face and said, ""Alright, well is there a happy hour menu or are there specific items that are on special?"" She replied, ""No there are no price differences and it's happy hour all day because our prices are much lower than anywhere else."" I looked at her slightly incredulously and said, ""So you're saying these are the prices and that's it? No differences at any point during the day?"" She smiled and nodded. As if her word painting somehow changed the fact that there IS no happy hour. And that's all I asked for without looking for some kind of workaround to convince me that I'm getting some amazing deal. Which I'm not. Because it's still 15 bucks for a burger. Then I ordered a drink. Mistake number two. (First mistake was asking any questions at all.) When it arrived it was very watery and tasteless. I asked to exchange it when the waitress returned, and she wouldn't even pick up the drink to take it away and instead said these words to me: ""I can't take it off the bill, you will have to pay for it anyway."" My jaw fell, just a little, and I stared at her, and said ""But I don't like it and would like to replace it."" She said ""We can't do that and you'll still have to pay for it."" I stared at her, burst out laughing and said ""Are you serious?"" She, again, smiled and nodded. I.....just..............yeah. Food took fooooorrrreeeeevvvver to come out.

I told her we still were missing an entrée and she acted as if it was my fault!  Once she finally realized that no one put in the order, she came over to apologize, but really it's not acceptable to blame the customer for poor service!  Everyone was just really unfriendly and unhelpful.   At least they comped us for that entrée!

I haven't had a Red Robin do that in a long time. So cool! Definitely helped ease hangriness while waiting for food. :D She kept our drinks filled and us comfortable. My only complaint - which isn't on any waitresses - is the setup of the entire restaurant, it's so open feeling but I saw there were other places a little less ""open"". Just my small thoughts. Anyways, everything else was great, our food came out in a timely manner and our waitress made sure we were still stocked with everything. A manager also came by just to check in on us and that was also very nice.  The employees were all working very hard and moving around and helping each other out really well, which can be hard with some locations where employees often just chat or stand around.

The food came out incredibly slow, the appetizer came out after the 3 of the 4 entrees...the 4th enter came out after the 3 were eaten 3/4....so I didn't get to enjoy my food with the company I came with.

I can understand running out of product once in awhile but to run out and be out on a continuous basis is outrageous. We asked our waitress about being out of avocado and she told us that they hadn't been able to get it from their vendor.

The experience we had in this location today however, will probably reduce our RR visits to 3-4 times a week. Let me tell you why.  First of all, host didn't smile when he greeted us. I could see my husband was visibly upset by this rude greeting we experienced. But we were starving so went in anyway.   We ordered without issues. My husband is allergic to lettuce and tomatoes so we made sure there wouldn't be any in his burger.  Last time we came here I counted 16 fries in my fry holder. Alas, this time I counted 12 fries. I of course was very disappointed by the lack of fries. However my I couldn't help but notice my husband had more fries than I had, and that felt like he was getting special treatment. They put lettuce and tomatoes on my husband's burger but not on mine. Also, they really should maker fries smaller, because I almost choked on a fry. When I told our waitress about my complaint with their fry sizes, she rolled her eyes and said there's nothing she can do about potota sizes.

113,Chris S.,"Everett, WA",142,158,22.0,2.0,2017-02-23,"My parents moved to WA in the late 60s so my Dad could attend grad school at the UW. They loved it here and decided to stay. One of the things they loved about their time at UW was eating at the original Red Robin on Fuhrman Ave. After he graduated, they moved to the country and weren't able to get back very often so they were delighted when Red Robin expanded and franchised which led to one being built in Federal Way which was a reasonable driving distance from our home. I swear that was the only place they really wanted to go out to dinner when I was a kid. I've never been a big burger fanatic but I did like the Monster Burgers and bottomless steak fries. I also loved the teriyaki chicken sandwich, their wings and the clam chowder.  I moved to Colorado for a couple of years after high school and was happy to find that it had become popular there as well. It was a taste of home and I dragged all my friends there constantly. When I returned to WA and met my wife, our first date was at the East Hill location in Kent. At some point I made the observation that when I ordered refills on my bottomless fries, they usually seemed to come out a bit overcooked. I theorized that this was to discourage hungry young guys such as myself from camping out and binging on fries. One of my buddies voiced that observation to our waiter one night at the old downtown Bellevue location which I believe is now a parking lot. We probably got our drinks spit in but I have no evidence of that.  Their prices kept going up and I was soon paying nearly $10 for the Monster Burger that used to cost me around $6. At that point, I embraced my love of Asian food and took a lengthy break from Red Robin. About 10 years later, I worked in an office in Woodinville that brought in discounted lunch every day from different local restaurants. On Red Robin Day, I ordered the same thing as I had as a teenager, a Monster Burger and fries. One bite and I was hooked again. The prices were over $10 by then but prices had gone up everywhere so it was less of a big deal than when I was a newlywed. Thus followed a five year streak of regular eating and enjoyment of Red Robin. At that point, I noticed a distinct drop in the quality of the food and service. I hung on for a while but after bad service issues at the Lynnwood and Monroe locations that were bad enough that I wrote complaint emails to the company I reevaluated. The waiter in Lynnwood was so rude to our friends and us that I've never been back to that location. The Monroe manager made a great effort to make things right and it was more just carelessness on the part of a server. A good manager does make a difference but I decided to go back on hiatus. We had also had many bad service incidents at the Everett location which is the one closest to where we have lived for the past decade-plus and the food just didn't taste the same anymore and gave me indigestion.  It has been a while since I ate there but the other day, my wife was craving a Mile High Mud Pie. We stopped in for  a quick dinner and by the end of my meal, I reaffirmed that I'm done with this place. The Monster Burgers cost nearly $15 now. I ordered the Seafood Scatter which I always liked but it was about 1/3 the size it was when I was younger and cost $16+. To add insult to injury, the fish was overcooked as well. They never did bring me my coleslaw and when I asked them for a small cup of pickles to eat with my fish, they told me they would have to charge me for a bottle of pickles. Seriously, that actually happened. I had to ask four times for a fry refill, once to the manager who stopped by to ask how our meal was. I had to ask two more times after that and when it came, it was, of course, overcooked and a very small portion. They're really guarding their french fry consumption apparently.  I tell you all this long story to illustrate that I've had a long relationship with this restaurant. My folks started eating there over 40 years ago and I've been eating there for at least 30. You'll never hate anyone or anything more than someone or something you once loved who/that let you down hard. So long Red Robin. In my end of town, I have Bob's Burger and Brew, Blazin' Onion and several other better alternatives now. When I'm in the mood for a burger, I'll take my business to them. At the very least, if you had maintained the quality of your food and service, I could have gutted out the massive increase in price over the years but you didn't so I'm out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-everett?start=20,2.08,1.99,1.99,2.184,2.0260000000000002

We quit eating at Red Robin a couple years back when Ziosk's were first introduced. Tried them again, and they are still the center-piece on all tables. First Ziosk's. Who wants to go out for lunch or dinner, and have a tablet in the middle of the table pushing advertising and games? Very distracting when having a conversation, so we just place it face down on the table.  The Ziosk's also have a microphone and camera. How does Red Robin use audio and video from tables? Lastly, we had to pay using the Ziosk. Apple Pay did not work, nor did the chip reader, so we had to use the mag strip/swipe method. Really unsecure. I wonder when a hack or skim will take place. Second, wait staff pretty underwhelming. There were a group of them near our table having a great conversation with each other, at the expense of paying customers.

15,Nikki H.,"Everett, WA",24,11,,3.0,2017-05-29,"I'll start by saying usually the food is good and service decent. Tonight was an exception. The pretzel bites were highly over cooked. Nearly burnt. The salad was underwhelming. I ordered the bbq chicken salad which comes with Baja veggies, lime and garlic bread. The salad was a thin layer of green leaves. Some small cut tomatoes and chicken with a little bit bbq sauce. All the items that make the bbq salad unique were.missing. no baba veggies, no lime, no garlic bread.... my husband is uncomfortable with complaining so I just ate it and left disappointed.   Yelp is my outlet.

107,Rick N.,"Lake Stevens, WA",0,4,,2.0,2017-06-11,"What started out as a four star visit eventually became a two star visit. We visited in between the lunch and dinner rush, and it was pretty dead. Beverage refills were slow. My wife's burger came out wrong and it took about 15 minutes to correct. She sat and watched as the rest of the family ate. It feels to me like once food is dropped off, they feel like their job is done- who cares if the order is incorrect? Normally service is pretty good here. I don't know what it was about today. On a positive note, this location knows how to correctly prepare and serve their Ensenada Chicken- something the Twin Lakes location still can't figure out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-everett?start=20,2.2,2.07,2.07,,2.1220000000000003
105,Trina L.,"Marysville, WA",0,14,,3.0,2017-06-12,We were seated quickly on a Monday night. Our server came quick to take our drink choice while we waited. Our company came and we ordered. Our appetizer came hot and quick. However when our food came my daughter in law didn't get what she ordered. We had to wait a good ten minutes before we could flag down a server that looked in our general direction. Once we explained that the burger we received was incorrect it took over thirty minutes for them to bring the correct burger. At that point the rest of the table had finished eating so we needed to take it to go. By all means the server was sure to collect payment before the correct burger was brought out.

I doubted we would get good service. I was wrong! Rashad came right away to get drink orders, and returned quickly with our drinks. We ordered nachos, gourmet cheeseburgers and steak fries.

I've been going to this location for many years and it can be inconsistent. Sometimes good, sometimes not so good, and a few servers here and there that need extra training, but most of this time it's okay.  Tonight they disappointed me. My husband and I ordered to go. He ordered the teriyaki chicken burger, one of his usuals, and it was way undercooked. After a few bites that my husband couldn't chew well, he asked me to inspect it. I told him to stop eating because it's half cooked. We both could not eat our food after that. I was grossed out, so you can imagine how he feels. He called and one of the managers apologized and offered for him to come in for a free burger tonight or when we come back. When he told me that I was super disappointed. As if we want to eat there anytime soon. I plan on asking for a full refund of our meals tomorrow when I talk to the head manager.

I thought everything came with the already $10 burger but nah everything was extra. Ended up paying almost $60(tip included) just for two people and a baby! Ridiculous. Patties are $3.50 extra? Are you kidding? Sauce is a dollar extra too like wtf. That little thumb sized sauce a whole dollar. I know it's my fault for not asking the price for EVERYTHING but come on. Money grubbin establishment. But of course we had to tip just because we always do. 7 bucks I wish we didn't have because she should have mentioned they were gonna be extra like wtf. Why suggest and not tell us that it would be an add on? The one fuckin time I don't ask the price for everything we end up getting a shit ton extra shit. Rather eat a casino burger than their mediocre Big Mac I could buy at BK. Never had this problem at other burger joints. To be honest I regret coming here.

89,Eric C.,"Westmont, Everett, WA",178,4,,1.0,2017-09-23,"I was going to leave this alone but it keeps eating at me... A month or two ago my wife and I attended this location for a night out (we also had our 8 year old son with us). Our entire experience was less than 1 star worthy. To start they gave our son his menu in Spanish. We do not speak Spanish so my son was unable to play the games on the children's menu or even read the foods that were offered. It was a very long time after being seated before anyone came to check on us while we sat there trying to figure out what the menu items were. When they finally showed up we asked them about the menu and we were told that they only had Spanish kid's menus at the time (which I find very strange). OK we just ordered him something, I can't exactly remember what he got. I ordered the Sriracha Tavern Burger and my wife ordered the Smoky Jack Tavern Burger. After waiting for a very long time to receive our food the server arrives with our food. My son gets his, I get mine, and the server dumps my wife's entire plate on her, ranch and campfire sauce sides and all. OK. We decide to not make a big deal about it and assure the server that it's fine. OK. Server tells us that the good thing about it is that it bumps our order to the number one priority so we won't have to wait an ungodly amount of time for the replacement to arrive. Alright that sounds decent, I wait for my wife's food to arrive and our son starts eating his food. Now it's been about 20 minutes and we have seen multiple tables be served but our food still hasn't arrived. Our son is finished and is getting antsy and my food is now cold. OK. Then they bring my wife her food and how about that, they brought her a Sriracha Tavern Burger (the wrong burger). Alright so at this point we're like whatever I'm very hungry, my food is cold, my son is starting to act up and we are generally unhappy. The restaurant manager was present but never came by to see if we were OK or if we needed anything. Nobody even offered us any sort of compensation for the issues (we were drinking water and weren't even offered a drink upgrade or anything). This was literally one of my worst experiences at any restaurant literally ever and do not plan on returning to this location. I wasn't a one time customer either, we generally went about monthly for burgers and beers but no longer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-everett?start=40,2.24,2.14,2.14,,2.18

Took the front greeter almost ten minutes to seat two of us. Once seated (to the right of the entrance area they have a dining area that's less attractive then McDonald's dining area. It's right next to the kitchen.) The waitress took almost 10 minutes to get our drink orders which at that point we decided to put our dinner orders in as well since we didn't want a long wait again. She took our orders and I specifically stated NO PINK in my burger. Another 15 minutes go by, drinks have been empty for close to 5 minutes and she comes out with the food. My friends fish and chips were burnt. I took 2 bites of my burger and it was PINK. Not even a little bit but completely PINK. I ate my fries and we waited for her to come back. I told her the burger was pink and she took it to the back,  manager came out and asked if I would like a reorder of the burger I said no she asked if I'd like something else I said sure chicken Caesar wrap to go. The manager was going to comp the meal and obviously since she asked and wanted to remedy the situation the wrap to go as well. The waitress comes back to ring us out and took a measly $5 off the total!! Horrible service and horrible food.

And I even got the chicken version of Madlove and felt that way. As for the fries, they were pretty good, too, though I will say they need about 3x the garlic. (I ordered the garlic fries.)

0,David J C.,"Everett, WA",73,129,95.0,5.0,2017-11-26,"This review is based on our take out experience that we do almost on a weekly basis. First off, Red Robin's has a pretty easy to use online take out order system. This allows us to come in, get our favorite food, and eat it in a more calm and comfortable place. I say that because sometimes you want the Red Robin food, but not the busy and loud atmosphere that it often has. Because it is takeout, we haven't had much interactions with the servers, but for the most part they seem active in their work and friendly. As for food, I wouldn't steer far from what they are known for- burgers. The classic gourmet is what they are known for, and possibly their only real home run as for 5 star food.  I've noticed they can be pretty skimpy with the sauces and fries, so don't be afraid to ask for more.
