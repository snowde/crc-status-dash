409,Missy A.,"Santa Rosa, CA",0,14,,4.0,2012-01-08,Stopped in for lunch after shopping. Service was excellent and food was better than expected. Chose the turkey burger with sweet potato fries and was pleasantly surprised how good they were. I don't make a habit out of eating at places in a mall but I would go back here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield?start=400,2.88,2.88,2.88,2.576,2.88
398,Stacey W.,"Alameda, CA",357,141,83.0,1.0,2012-04-03,Man the service was horrible here. The Concord and Newark locations wereway better. We ordered a cheese dip as a appetizer and not once but twice did they serve it to us cold. I mean it's only so difficult to microwave. We had to wave down our waiter multiple times and spent most of our meal feeling ignored and thirsty. My speckled lemonade was not looking friendly. I would definitely not visit this location again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield?start=380,2.8,2.8,2.8,2.212,2.8

We ordered onion rings, three entrees and a kids meal. Not one thing was warm, except my daughter's fruit cup. Ew. Our waitress seemed busy, but was pleasant. The hostess was not busy or pleasant.

347,Donna F.,"Vallejo, CA",140,94,70.0,3.0,2012-07-13,"I don't visit Red Robin often, but when I do, the food is consistent.  I ordered a whiskey BBQ chicken wrap with freckled fruit salad, my friend ordered a royal red robin burger with fries and her son had a pepperoni pizza with mandarin oranges,  we also redeemed a Facebook coupon offer for an order of free sweet potato fries.  They claim it comes with a side of ""spicy ketchup"" sauce, but it all honesty it's just sweet chili sauce.  It was good, but I'd rather order the tower of onion rings. My lack of two more stars is due to our server. 1. She was pretty spacey. 2. She forgot to enter the coupon for the free appetizer. 3. HER NAILS WERE DIRTY!!!!

We Sat in the dining room instead of the bar and had the worst possible service.  No drink refill only saw our waiter helping other tables and my friend got a whopping 8 fries with his burger and after flagging down our waiter and another for another basket we left after 30 min of no fries or anything.

420,Iz L.,"Fresno, CA",0,9,,2.0,2012-09-18,Me and my family came here for dinner while in town we had a bit of a hard time finding it since we are not from Fairfield. When we entered the place wasn't too busy the service from our waitress wasn't all that great she never offered me a refill on my drink and she hardly checked up on us. The only good thing was that our food was made fast but the overall presentation of my dish wasn't pretty at my local Red Robin my food looks better as for the taste its good as always. It was also someones birthday there too so the workers sang to the person but it was very loud and annoying when you're trying to enjoy a nice dinner if it was they wern't screaming the happy birthday song at the top of their lungs I wouldn't have gotten annoyed with that.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield?start=420,2.68,2.68,2.68,2.536,2.68
286,Paulamertha A.,"Suisun City, CA",287,472,639.0,1.0,2012-09-21,"A friend and I decided to grab a bite to eat here earlier this week (on a weekday). We've been here several times in the past with no big problems; however, there was a bunch of stuff that irked me this particular night that we went. First and foremost, the hostess saw that I'm using crutches and that I have a walking boot on, but when it came time for her to lead us to our table, she basically took off so it was hard for me to keep up with her. Luckily my friend asked her to slow up and pointed towards me. She stopped so I could catch up, but she didn't apologize or anything, just smiled. That was the first thing that rubbed me the wrong way about that night. Our waitress came by quickly to ask us what we wanted to drink; however, it took her FOREVER to come back and take our orders! The place was NOT packed, so I felt like there was no logical reason for the service to be so damn slow!  My friend & I both ordered garlic fries, but when out meal was brought out to us, our fries looked completely different. Usually it comes with garlic (duh), shredded cheese, and parsley (I believe). His had everything on it and mine just looked like they quickly threw on garlic on it before it was brought out to me. I usually don't nit pick at stuff, but for some reason that bothered me but I couldn't complain because the waitress disappeared once again. She was nowhere to be found until she saw that our fries were low, when we were almost done with our burgers. As if our dining experience couldn't get any worse, when she brought our refill of fries, she pretty much just threw them on the table and immediately walked to the people sitting at the table behind us (they were waiting such a long time that they just told her that they weren't going to eat there). The only time she was attentive to us was when it came time to pay. I was already out of water long before I finished my burger, but since she dropped the bill off and since I was still somewhat picking at fries, that's when she wanted to give me a refill on my water. I'm honestly very disappointed with my latest experience at this Red Robin location. There weren't a lot of guest dining here, yet the service was slow as hell! On top of that, I felt like the hostess was rude and inconsiderate when she clearly saw that I'm temporarily disabled. It just makes me wonder what the hell does she do when there are people with permanent disabilities. The waitress was slow, not really attentive to us, and I felt like she was rude since she threw our fries at us. I definitely won't be returning to this Red Robin anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield?start=320,2.6,2.6,2.6,2.5320000000000005,2.6

My experience:    I approached a girl at the front and asked if I could get a table for 10 with 3 high chairs so total of 13. The girl talked to another coworker in front of me and said ""ugh she needs a table for 13"" and the coworker goes ""hmm, I'll see what I can do"" takes off quickly and comes back in 3 minutes and says ""ok, it's gonna be about 30 mins."" Then another girl comes up and says ""it will be about 10 mins"" So we waited 15 (5 mins off from what they told us but its better than 30) They seated us and our waitress Cassandra started us off with drinks. She brought drinks (one of the guys beer looked like someone took a big gulp out of it while the other was filled to the top) and took our order then an HOUR goes by,... (she didn't even come by to apologize for the wait or even ask us if we needed anything else. we didn't see her since she took our order)  I get up to find our waitress to ask about our food and if we could get some fries because she said they still didn't start on our food. BTW, I have 2 starving pregnant women, 5 kids all under 10 that were also hungry, antsy, tired, and by this time one of the boys fell asleep without having a bite to eat. She brought us some crappy fries then 10 minutes later our food comes out. COLD food... REALLY?! wow... and they got 3 orders wrong! including a child's mac and cheese?... 3 waitresses were passing out the food and set the big tray on a nearby/ empty table. They left my pregnant friend's plate on that table and left. Her husband got up to grab her plate and we sat there with  people without their food and 3 others that couldn't eat their food because we had NO utensils! One of my friend's husband spoke to a manager to complain and she said we're swamped and the wait is normal. (not all tables were even filled up) ""NORMAL?!"" she did absolutely NOTHING.. are you kidding me? nothing was taken off the bill, not even a discount or anything.

They're always crispy and very tender.  The bottomless fries along with their house spice is the bomb dot com.  If I want a burger I will get a Royal burger which is bacon, cheese, lettuce, tomato and a fried egg on top of a medium rare meat patty.  Mmmm just writing about makes my mouth water.  I have only encountered one problem at this location but the manager was sure to make things right by giving me a $25 gift card and asking us to check in with her each time we came in.  I thought that was class service.  I feel like this location has better food and service compared to the Pleasant Hill location. Oh and I wanted to mention I'm not a milkshake person but when Red Robin offered the gingerbread milkshake I had to try it and it totally changed my mind about milkshakes.  I'm picky about them and theirs was delicious!

Those things aside, this is another one of your run of the mill diners that I only seem to hit up when I'm the mall with a large amount of friends. Out there, you've got the king of chain diners, the one and only Denny's. At the bottom of the barrel, you've got Applebees... ugh, I feel my stomach turning already, just mentioning that place. Then you've places like Red Robin's. Also a diner, but they seem to have a particular specialty in the area of burgers. Crack open their menu and you'll find a bevy of all sorts of burgers. I've had a couple of burgers here. While nicely sized, they never seem to come out just right. They always tend to come out on the dry side. I've ordered medium rare and I once even attempted rare... but alas, the end result was the same. Burger tasted alright though, and no ill effects on my digestive system, so that's always a plus. Like I mentioned at the onset, there's a few things I like about this place. Though on somewhat of a downside, they a little on the slow side when it comes to the bottomless fries. Still, gotta love that tower of onion rings and that Irish milkshake. I guess if I ever had to choose between this or Denny's... I might still end up at Denny's for nostaglia's sake.

313,Christopher C.,"Solano, CA",285,111,23.0,2.0,2014-10-09,"This Red Robin has gone down hill tremendously and quick!  While the food is just what you expect from a mall restaurant the service has pretty much hit rock bottom (again). My family has been coming year for quite some time and there has always been service issues. Whether it be slow, wrong, or just lazy it never quite gets high marks. Even at one visit a couple of years ago my wife made a comment to our server about the lack of organization and gaps in service to which the server went on to explain that the whole management staff was just fired and everyone working that day was replacements. This actually gave a ray of hope for the restaurant. We understood the chaos that could be brought on by a sudden change in leadership and embraced the fact that finally service might actually get better. I did...for a little while. Soon enough it was back to the inconsistency we have found to be the norm at this location. Fast forward to last night. We (7 of us) arrived at about 7:00p on a Wednesday evening...not very crowded. Actually about at 50% capacity if not less. However, with the amount of time we saw our server you would think that she was covering the entire restaurant herself. She took our drink order, then our food order, delivered food and that was about it. No refills, not coming by to check on us (even though other servers did and so did the manager). We asked for more condiments which were brought by another employee about 10 minutes later. My wife asked for a spoon for our son right when the food was brought out, she never came back. My wife went and got one herself. THEN 10 minutes after that, after our son had finished his meal she brought the spoon acting like we had just asked for it. Still no one had offered refills or anything. The server came back and pretty much offered us anything we wanted since she was doing such a bad job. Any food we wanted a ""refill"" on we could have....Kind of weird but whatever. After we had finished eating we waited....and waited...and WAITED for about 30 minutes for our check. Not only did we have to wait, we had to get another server to get the manager to get our check. Our server pretty much stopped caring and never came back.  Luckily the manager comped some of the meals but really thats not the point. It was just embarrassing how bad the service was and how little they seemed to care about it. Just as we were leaving the server came back and acted like she was trying to save face or something but gave a very lackluster ""apology"" and went on her way again.  Im sure we will go back at some point but we will never go to Red Robin when it is actually busy or when we are in a hurry. There is no telling how long you will have to wait for a spoon or your check. Dont go thirsty either, unless one glass of water is ok for an hour.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield?start=280,2.44,2.72,2.72,1.512,2.608

THEN we finally got our food which was cold and the order was wrong. I constantly had to get our waitresses attention to get refills not once did she come by to see if we needed anything I believe her name was Katie lynn.

308,Keila Renée R.,"Concord, CA",41,32,11.0,2.0,2014-10-25,"Okay so before I write this review I would like to state that I work in a restaurant, therefore I can appreciate the hard work it takes for everybody part of making it function. We walked in & it took about 5 minutes to be acknowledged. There was a woman standing at the station right beside us gathering checks for a party of 4 who apparently all wanted separate checks. It's a little more of a hassle when people ask for that-I know. However I didn't even get a ""be right with you"" or anything. She proceeded to drop off the checks & check on a few other tables, count some cash from her apron, & walk out of sight. Finally a lady came to seat us and I was already a little frustrated because I was hungry.  We were seated, a woman asked for our drink orders and she must've been new cause she was confused when I asked for the Thorny Señorita Rita and I had to point it out on the menu. She didn't ask whether I wanted it on the rocks or blended and I forgot to specify, and she didn't card me. I just turned 21 earlier this month so getting carded is somewhat fun for me because I finally have the proof! But anyways, our waiter was a different young man and was very nice. He took our orders and I asked him to make sure my drink was on the rocks. Our food came out, it was not good. I ordered the fish & chips and a cup of clam chowder to share with my sister, my mom ordered a cup of tortilla soup. The chips tasted stale, the soup was room temperature, & the bread that came with it was stale as well. The fish tasted fresh and pleasant but it was the only thing I really enjoyed. I asked for my soup to be re-warmed and they did it. In my restaurant, when something is cold, we have it re-made completely but I doubt the soup here is made to order. By this time my margarita still hadn't come out. Our server kept checking on it and it wasn't ready. I didn't want to make things difficult for him because I hate when customers blame me for things that go wrong in the kitchen and I ate it anyways because I was too hungry to wait for it to be re-made. A review for a restaurant as big as Red Robin probably won't make any difference, people will still come. However I hope they work these things out to become better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield?start=280,2.48,2.69,2.69,1.4800000000000002,2.606

My sons and I have been coming to this RR for several years, at least a couple times a month or more. During the past few months the quality of the food and the service there has gone downhill FAST. It used to be great??? I'm confused. I will mention only our last two visits, as there is too much else to mention here.. I kept giving it another try hoping the old familiar place would be back, but last night was the LAST straw.  Yesterday - My son ordered a plain hamburger. It arrived with a BITE taken out of the meat. Yes, a bite. Maybe it was just a fluke and the patty happened to be shaped that way? But this SCREAMS re-plating.  Also, I am vegetarian and ordered a wedge salad with NO BACON. The first one came with EXTRA BACON. Sent it back. The 2nd one came with a little bit of bacon tucked under some of the dressing like they either scraped off the other one, or somebody thought it was funny to throw a little bacon in there so I wouldn't notice because I sent it back. Insulting. As a side note, roughly half of the time that I order a garden patty on my burger, they send real meat and I have to send it back. Anyway, on this occasion the manager came over and apologized and took care of our check. Its sad that he had to do that. He will never have to do that again if he properly trains his staff.  A few weeks ago we were there - Our waitress was DRUNK. It was me and my kids again. I ordered ONE beer, and I was the only one at the table old enough to drink. A while later a different server arrives with TWO beers. Huh??? I send one back. It makes me wonder if the waitress wasn't hoping to keep one for herself. She had slurred speech and was quite obviously intoxicated. A short time later I was actually ready for a 2nd one, and it never arrived.  Many of the wonderful servers that used to work there I noticed are no longer present. Many of them knew my family by name because we go there so much. Now it seems the turnover is high and staff is not properly trained.

I'm a fan of Red Robin in general and I couldn't imagine one location being so much worse than others. I was wrong.  When we arrived, there was a couple ahead of us, waiting on the hostess who was taking an order of some kind on the phone. Had she acknowledged the 4 of us it wouldn't have phased me but we were all standing there kind of confused instead.  After we were seated the waitress seemed to be engaging and kind so I didn't think much of the previous interaction. Unfortunately, after we ordered things began to fall apart. It took quite a while just to get our chips and salsa. When it arrived, the chips were soaked in grease, about an inch of which had collected on the bottom of the bowl. The guac and salsa also had a strange, sour taste to them. Our entrees took twice as long and were just as lack-luster. Our salads were not the normal size I receive at other locations, this was much smaller (not worth the $11) and there were more onions than there was lettuce. The lettuce itself was soggy and discolored.  TLDR: the food and service at this location is no where near the quality of other Red Robin establishments.

My beer arrived almost 20 minutes later room temp and almost flat. My 24 year old nephew asked if he could take a sip and of course I obliged. Another waiter saw what happened while cleaning up someone else's dirty table that another customer had already sat down at. Immediately stopped and took a B-line to our table and grabbed my beer that I ordered and very rudely scolded us telling us that she will not have minors drinking in her restaurant, and will no longer serve alcohol at our table. After my nephew went to his car and another 15 minutes gone by without so much as being asked for a different drink, he showed the licence to the manager, got into a small tiff with her and was actually YELLED at by a female member of management.

In regards to the food, they tend to load the burgers with mayo, BBQ sauce, or whatever sauce you get which makes them slippery and falls apart easily. Tip: Ask to have it cut the burger in half. It doesn't fall apart as easily. In my experience the fries have never been great. They're either soggy or not very hot. I like my fries crispy and warm thank you very much. As far as taste, it'll hit the spot if you're really craving a burger, just don't expect anything spectacular. The service is just okay. The waiters don't really seem to want to be there. This isn't related to the service, but the last time I was there the forks and knives were really gross and needed to be cleaned again. So I suggest you check those before using them.

Now I understand that this location is being remodeled and all but does the service have to suck as well? So we sit at the bar and the lady asked us what would like to drink? I ordered two beers and a shot. She said ok, poured the beers and then disappeared. I mean she never came back! So as I'm looking around her co-worker approaches and ask if she could help. I re-ordered my shot and asked where was the original bartender in which she replied. I don't know, I think she forgot about you and went to run food. Alrighty then. So after it seemed like forever she shows back up and asked if we were ready to order. We placed the order and she turned to us as she was typing in the order and laughed. She mentioned something about her log in number and that the system didn't recognize her. She walked off and I assumed she went to take care of whatever was going on with her log in and still place our order. Well I must say we sat for about and half hour not including the time we had already been there. The guy sitting in the back of us came in after we sat down as well as others and they all received their food! Ok something is very wrong here. She delivered her food to other tables but ours was no where to be seen. She even came back into the bar joking and laughing, but with no food and explanation why? Just as we started to get a manager and cancel the order, she finally brought our food which was unsatisfactory. My fries were ice cold and my husbands chicken was cold and his salad looked pitiful and thrown together. I also want to point out that he asked if he could have his chicken grilled to which he got a no response. Now I have worked in the same industry for years and have been told by many managers that if we have the ingredients to make what the guest request, then we do it. I can't believe that Red Robin has to just fry everything and can't put chicken on the grill instead. Needless to say we refused the food and she removed it from our bill, but I have to say that if I were her. Because it was her fault all the way and I told her as much. She simply forgot to put our order in the computer and instead of making it right by apologizing and possibly getting the manager involved. She thought by bringing us cold, dry food to two ""drunk"" people at the bar that it was going to fly pass us. We only had 1 beer and I had the shot. I would have comped the entire bill and or offered fresh food or something. We will not be returning and to think I had never been to a Red Robin before and now that I have had such crappy service, I won't give it another shot!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield?start=160,1.68,2.32,2.32,1.252,2.064

I came here last night with a party of six. The place has been remodeled and looks fantastic, unfortunately that's the only good thing to say about it. They sat us on the outside area that comes into the mall. I personally didn't have a problem with it, but the lady never even asked us if that was ok (some people don't like people watching them eat ya know?).  The waitress we got was absolutely terrible. Let's lot of what exactly went down. First off the lady took forever to get everyone their drinks. I'm talking close to 15 minutes to get a drink. Refills were pretty nonexistent. We asked several times to get more water and lemonade. She would say yes she was on her way, but ten minutes would go by with no new drink...like cmon. Another one of our friends waited almost half an hour for water and she said all the glasses were getting clean. Total BS. We got two appetizers. Mozzarella sticks and onion rings. The mozzarella sticks were delicious I will say, but when she brought the onions rings there was a slight problem. They were not stacked because she said the stacking tool was gone or they didn't have enough. Wtf?! First the dirty glasses then this? She didn't even attempt to stack them and sloppily out them on the plate. The food was terrible. My girlfriend ordered the clucks and fries and the chicken was absolutely dry. I ordered the new genisys burger and it looked nothing like the picture and wasn't that great (as seen in my photo). The fries were all soggy too like they'd been left out too long not to mention they barely give any fries anymore regardless that's it's ""bottomless."" The big kicker here was my friend can't eat any kind of pork product. When his burger arrived lo and behold he had bacon on there. The waitress brought it back two minutes later and said they put a new bun, new lettuce and cheese on it but removed the bacon. Whoah lady! My friends religious background means no bacon. And the bacon grease had seeped all over the meat and she thought it was ok. We sent it back to get a brand new one, but it took over 25 minutes to get it...absolutely ridiculous. When we paid the bill we all agreed we were never coming back. My friend asked the lady why the food was so bad. Was it a new cook? The lady replied they were short staffed and that if we knew any cooks to tell them to apply. Wow. That's all wow. I hope she enjoyed the $2 dollar tip.

First of all, I'd like to thank them for caring and reaching out. I really didn't expect all that so good job there guys. To be fair I really took the time to give RR another chance so I've been back twice, once on a weekday and again on a busy Sunday.  Both times I had the same waitress and I must say she is one of the best I've had at RR, her name is Esperanza. She really hustles and makes sure you're enjoying your visit.  On the weekday, we went in for lunch and it wasn't too busy. Drink refills were adequate and we requested fries to come before the meal so we could have something to snack while waiting for the entree. The food came out fast so we didn't have to wait.  Big plus there. We also had several fries refills no prob.  On the weekend, ordered the same meal but with broccoli this time. We got a bowl of broccoli early and fast. AND It was piping hot! THIS is the RR I expect. Thank you lunch staff and Esperanza. It did get very busy there afterward and the kitchen unfortunately got backed up. We only got 1 broccoli refill and it didn't arrive until we were full.  Esperanza did what she could and was very honest and apologetic so I appreciate that.  To fix this, I think the kitchen may need to make more of the refill items available for the servers to fill.  Also for peak hours perhaps have more staff.  The new men's room layout is amazing. It finally makes sense in there. And it smelled nice. So far A+ for the renovation.  With a good server and a little patience, you can still enjoy and get your Red Robin fix.  But weekdays have much better service over weekends.  I still got a little irked by one of the intense waitresses but it looks like she works hard as well. She may need some training in caring about all patrons as valued guests and not as in-laws.

The service is consistently terrible - waitresses who could care less and management that needs to step up and get their employees in gear. This last visit was a to-go order (we assumed just call it in and skip the tremendous wait times). Had to call three times. First call I was on hold for over eight minutes. Hung up and called back, the woman who answered asked to put me on hold again. I said that I had been waiting and no one picked up. She gave the excuse of them being busy, offered no apology and continued to insist to put me on hold.  The length of time she spent arguing with me she could have just taken my order. I said forget it and hung up. My husband decided to call and try his luck (I am currently pregnant and my sweet husband wanted to make sure my craving was fulfilled). He was able to place our order with another gentleman who answered pretty painlessly. He got clucks and fries and I got the french dip sandwich which we were told would be ready in 15 to 20 minutes. Went to pick up our order (arrived 25 minutes after placing the order) and was directed to the bar. With one bartender making drinks she was also required to handle the to go orders and package them herself. After waiting 10 more minutes our food was brought to us. Order was correct but I received a laughable amount of au jus sauce. Asked the bartender for a bit more and she got an attitude. Acted like she was majorly inconvenienced by my request for more. We got home and began to eat, our food was what we wanted but again we were disappointed in the serving size of their ""bottomless"" fries.  Again, a laughable amount.

Went there the other night with my neighbor.  He ordered a burger and complained that it was overcooked.  Which I could see that it was and it looked terribly dry, which he also said it was.  I mentioned it to the waitress who served us and once she sensed my disappointment she avoided our table.  I was able to eat my meal while my friend waited for his to be cooked again.  I tried to get the attention of the waitress but she acted like we had the plague.  I ended up going over to where they were cooking and could see the manager standing there waiting for the burger to be prepared.  Finally he comes out with the burger.  I had also wanted a refill of my drink and more fries.  Again the waitress avoided our table.  When the manager passed by I asked him and he seemed to not care and tried to avoid our table. Overall the food was disappointing, but the service was even worse. The last two times I went here the service sucked and I think I know the problem.  The servers who are mostly younger women think they deserve a big tip for what I see as mediocre service at best.  As for the food I have noticed the prices have gone up and the portion sizes have gone down.   The combination of both the above is a recipe for another restaurant closing .  I just don't see this place surviving in the long run.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield?start=140,1.56,1.69,1.69,1.3160000000000003,1.6380000000000003

307,Lazandro S.,"Vallejo, CA",5,8,,1.0,2015-12-30,"Where to start...was really excited to eat here again and was really looking forward to my Bonzai burger that I normally get. I brought my brother and mother along. Once we were seated and placed our order, it took much longer than it normally did; and I've been here (and other Red Robin locations) when it was more full. I ordered my burger medium done. The food finally came, and I ate my fries first, which did not take too long because there were only around 10 pieces. I took my craving bite into my bonzai burger, only to see that it was prepared well done. I am not the type that likes to waste food, so I did not complain and just ate it, disappointed. We were given napkins and knives, but no forks, which I have always been given in the past considering these are gourmet burgers. My mother called our server over and asked for a fork, and my brother and I asked for more fries. She said okay, and that the fries would take 3 to 5 minutes. My brother and I finished our burgers, and my mother finished her sandwich, and a fork was never given. At this point, no fries were given either, and I saw other parties getting fries. At this point, more time has passed by than us waiting for our burgers in the beginning, and still no fries. Our server finally came back with just one basket of fries, and never gave us a fork, which would have been pointless at this point since we all finished our burgers/sandwiches. Having been to this location many times, all of this was a huge disappointment, and this was the only time I ever felt that a server did not receive a tip of any amount. Instead of receiving bottomless fries, we received bottomless disappointment. It will be a while before I dine at this location again.

When I finally got ahold of them they put my on hold again and I didn't even have a chance to say anything. When I finally got off hold the man on the phone told me he's going to put me on hold but I cut him off and said I'm not going to be on hold anymore and if he can just take my order now. I was just upset that I was being passed around playing phone tag just for some onion rings! He took my order and that was that but what made me mad was there was no one in the restaurant so why was I being on hold?? I only know this because I work in the mall and my coworker passed by the place when she was picking up her food from Buffalo Wild Wings and she told me that there was no one in there.

Our drinks had to be refilled by the manager but only because we waived him down. We complained, but it didn't seem to do any good. One server was clearing plates from his customers table and dropped forks and spilled sauce all over the floor. It even got in another customer. I saw him look at what he dropped, but did he return to clean it up? No. He didn't even let a busser know. I expect that when i speak to a manager about his server that he would let her know to be more attentive to her table. Its not like we wanted her to sit at our table and wait until we needed something, but we didn't even get the bare minimum of what i think a server should be doing. Clearly, they need to do more server training.  The reason we came back was because our server from the last 2 times was outstanding (her name is Jessica ). Honestly all of their servers should take tips from her, or she needs to be the manager of this location.

I thought they were suppose to ask you that before hand but whatever.  Now.. On to the worse part. I understand fully well that fruit flies are common around a bar (wine, sweet drinks); unfortunately red robin does not have this under control. When a bug inevitably landed in my sauce, I calmly pointed it out to the waitress and politely asked for a replacement. Throughout the time I was eating, I was waving my hand to keep the little bugs away. Instead of apologizing or offering to give me another seat, the server simply agreed about the bugs and never checked on me or refilled my water again. As a result, I ended up paying electronically and leaving.

123,Stefani T.,"Madera, CA",0,26,,1.0,2016-06-19,"This was THE worst restaurant experience I have had in quite some time.  I thought the Applebee's in the Solano Town Center Mall was bad, but Red Robin managed to outdo them last night. I gave them the benefit of the doubt at first, it was after all 8:30 on a  Saturday night at the mall, so I figured we'd have to wait a little bit.  Plus we were a party of 5 with a small child.  However, the hostess stand was unattended when we got there, and it took at least 5 minutes before we even got a ""someone will be right with you"" from a passing server.   5 more minutes passed until someone did actually come over and seat us.   Even after pressing the ""call server"" button on the little computer thing on the table, we didn't see a server or even get offered so much as water for the next fifteen minutes.  Just as we were about to leave (after watching the couple at the table behind us walk out, presumably for the same reason), the server finally showed up.  We ordered drinks and food all at the same time, hoping to expedite the process.  My friend's little niece had also asked our server very politely for some crayons for her coloring page, which she never got.  I had to get up and go over to the STILL unmanned hostess stand and get them myself.  TWENTY minutes later, the drinks show up, and one of them was wrong. One of my friends ordered the bottomless root beer float.  The glass was maybe half full, with about a quarter of that being root beer. It looked pretty putrid. We're just about finished with our drinks, still no food.  Once again, we were considering just paying for those and leaving, since it was approaching 9:30 at this point, but we were so damn hungry by then we waited.  Two of our meals arrived, not brought by our original server.  We still had no napkins or silverware in front of us.  I asked this server if we could please get some silverware and such, she basically dismissed me, set down the other meal and walked off.  Thanks. My friend seated to my left got his burger, and it had been sitting under a heat lamp so long the bottom bun was completely soggy with burger juice.  My other friend's sandwich was almost cold.  I will say that the food, once we got it, was the best part, and even that wasn't anything to rave about.  We finally got silverware and napkins, unwrapped, and plopped down in front of me on a plate, which I guess it was up to me to distribute to everyone at the table.  Not once did a server ask us how everything was, did we want more drinks, one of my friends couldn't even get a refill on her water.   The place looked disgusting.  Tables weren't being bussed, garbage and food all over the floor by the tables from kids, fruit flies buzzing around.  When it came time to pay, one of us had to go get the check ourselves.  Then when we paid, we had to take the credit card up to the server station ourselves, and there was a LINE to do so.  Our group was waiting to leave as our friend who was treating waited to get his credit card back.  He was just standing there, for 5 minutes or more.  I finally got fed up, walked over and asked him, ""Do they still have your credit card?""  He said yes.  I hollered at the 4 or 5 people milling around, ""How long does it take to run a credit card??  Let's go!""  I don't like being pushed to have to speak to people like that, but the service in this location is beyond awful.  However, this was what was necessary to finally get his card back, as it magically appeared all of a sudden with the receipt.  Not sure about you, but I get a little suspicious when my credit card disappears behind the scenes for that long. The odd thing was, it really wasn't THAT crowded in there, so I'm not sure what was keeping the servers so tied up other than poor staffing and even poorer management.  This will now be the second restaurant in this same mall that I will never visit again.  I don't know if it's the mall management, or Red Robin themselves, but this location needs a serious overhaul, and fast.  I've eaten here previously and it was decent all around, not sure what happened, but judging by other reviews on here, this wasn't a one time thing last night. If I hadn't been with a group of friends, my patience would have run out much sooner.  It's pretty bad when the 4 year old was able to keep her cool better than I was.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield?start=140,1.76,1.53,1.972,1.3480000000000003,1.6220000000000003

This cake definitely looked like the frozen store bought SaraLee cake but tastes much worse. After 2 bites, my mom was done.  My mud pie was disappointing.

Took 20 minutes to even take our order and only because we had to complain and ask for a manager. He then apologized and said he wouldn't let our table be forgotten again. LIE. We literally waited for 35 minutes then we finally decided to ask for the manager again realizing that it's been almost an hour of us sitting at this same table with no food. It felt even worse because the place started getting empty and were still just sitting there. As we're waiting for the manager to come out, the hostess asked if we wanted refills in the mean time. And brought 2 out of 5 of the refills that we had to ask another waitress for the other 3 in which she gave us attitude.  Someone finally brings out our food. Literally just dropped it off then left. Burgers are usually finger food but we also ordered Mac n cheese and soup so obviously we needed utensils and of course, napkins. Since she left so fast we couldn't ask. My boyfriend got really upset and walked to the kitchen to talk to the manager that never came out.  It was a different manager this time named Josiah. After he heard from us, he was very sincere and offered to take care of our bill considering that our experience was ridiculous. Thank you Josiah for doing that but please fix this location and your staffs attitudes. The whole time only the hostess (barely) and the manager actually helped us.  As were walking out, the waitress that was suppose to be ours steps in front of us, ""did you pay?"" With this dumb little neck roll. She really had the audacity to have an attitude with US like we did something wrong. Did you help me at all tonight? No. Did you serve us? No. You have the time to ask us if we paid but where were you the whole time we were there? Ignoring us and only came at the end behind the manager pretending you actually cared. I just wanted to slap the dumbness off her face with her sick attitude. The manager had came out right after she asked us and told her it was okay. Hope she felt dumb.

A server walked past me to deliver food to the only other customers in the bar area. She walked back up to the POS terminal and another coworker, who looked like she was getting off, walked up to talk to her. Still... No acknowledgment of my existence and it had been 4 - 5 minutes at this point.  I finally asked if there was a bartender working. She said yes and that she would get her. She continued to enter on the terminal, checked on her table again and then walked away. By this time it had been about 7-8 minutes that I'd been sitting at the bar waiting. I was so turned off by the complete lack of customer service I decided to walk out. A sorry and a water would have helped the situation.  As soon as I asked if I could speak to a manager, the bartender walked past me quickly followed by a couple of other staff members giving me a smirk. I decided there was probably no point in letting the manager in on my frustration. The company culture staff project is typically a direct result in management style.

My husband and I wanted to take our 3yr old out for lunch after having a nice time at a near by pumpkin patch. Since we are Red Robin Royalty card members we thought we would stop at this Red Robin and have a nice lunch. We were seated right away and they didn't appear to be too busy, so I was shocked when we just kept being passed by and ignored. We waited 15min before getting up to explain the girl up front that we have been sitting for 15 min and no one has even come by to say ""Hi"". She told my husband that she would get someone to come help us right away. Another group that was seated next to us, having the same issue, was at least told by the manager who working the floor that he would have someone right with them....and then just passed us by. We waited a little longer and as it become evident that no one intended to come help us we got up and left (as did the group having the same problem). The best part of it all was as we were leaving we looked back through the ""Patio"" seating and saw the Manager who had ignored us clearing our lemurs off the table and acting like he was the hurt party in all this.  I have had mostly bad experiences at the Red Robin as of the past year. While I have had a few good experiences (all of which have been in the evening), they unfortunately do not out weigh the bad.

Tables are left uncleared while people wait too long. Now the food--most of the time it comes to me cold or warm for the dozen or so times I came to this place. Especially the fries--cold (I order second round and then they come to the table hot--that always does the trick). Asking for your burger well done means there's still pink in the middle. I think they use frozen burgers since that can only explain why the meat is still pink but clearly well done on the outside. I don't make much of a fuss but I've been with friends that won't accept cold food or pink meat. Menu items are great and diverse but again, temperature of the food is a bit disappointing. I still come here because the food is (still) good and some servers are friendly but the overall management of this restaurant needs some serious overhaul. Façade changes may help the atmosphere but staff that are sincere (and what they're doing) make the difference.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield?start=60,1.84,1.55,1.776,1.736,1.6660000000000004

We sat for quite awhile before my daughter's soup came out and the baby was crying because she was hungry. Service was very slow, so if you want fast service don't come here. When we finally got our food, it was good except the fries were only warm when they came out. Once we got our food, the waitress came by to check if everything was good, after that she never came back. I wanted more fries since you are suppose to get bottomless fries. After a long while, I finally press the call waitress button on the kiosk. We waited 15+ minutes and she never came by. I finally flagged, I think a manager and he got us the fries we wanted which were hot. Never again will I go back to this Red Robin.

We ordered the chili con queso and the A1 peppercorn burger.  So I called today to inform the management of the problem.

And it wasn't even the host, it was a Server named Angela who was so super sweet and very apologetic.

She looked frazzled and overwhelmed (which it wasn't really that busy). Not sure if she was new or just having a bad night. We ordered our appetizer (Double Cheese Sticks) and food at the same time ( the machine on our table wasn't working). We waited about 30 min for our appetizer than 2 min later our food came out.

After that it took about another 15 minutes for our drinks, since my drink came from the bar I had to wait longer. Finally, our drinks came and our order was placed. Do you know it literally took 1 hour for our food to come out and when it came out the plates were hotter than the fucking food.

There was no host at the front and had to wait along with other customers. Once I was seated I had to wait again just for the waiter to take my order and took even longer for our food to come out. The simpliest thing like a milkshake I order didnt get to my table until maybe 15 minutes. My waiter did not provide any napkins and utensil for our food. Waiting and waiting still no one coming by so I had to walked up to asked someone. By far this is the worst experience I've had anywhere. Looking around most waiters are working slow compare to the amount of customers they have. These workers need to speed up and check on their tables more often or they need to hire more people working every day. This is a spot located inside the mall and they should expect a decent amount of customers walking in on a daily basis. Food taste decent but customer service need to be worked on. Not only the service was very very poor they also need to maintance the women's restroom. It smelled bad and is definately in need of air vent or a freshener.  I do not recommend going to this location and rather go a different location or another restaurant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield?start=240,1.68,1.6,1.676,1.6680000000000001,1.6320000000000003

We didn't really have any problems until it came to our food. Some of our entrees came out around 9:50 - 10pm, pretty much closing. We finished 3/4ths of our meals before the next two peoples arrived. One being a side salad that came out warm after my entree. We ended up taking the salad off and sweat potato fries that we didn't know were out until about an hour later. Even worse, we had a soup that never made it out because it was taking too long. Even better, when we went to check they were just making it.  Once we had some food, they were quicker on giving us endless fries and some ranch. However the miss communication with the staff really messed up the experience. As a former server this was very disappointing because we would of understood any delays if they were reasonable. I think our server tried her best, maybe she's new but we could tell she was overwhelmed with us.  Additionally, if they were closing down the kitchen, we would of much rather been turned away.

She goes on to tell me that it's better to order online.  My main issue here is the lack of customer service. Not everything needs to be online, almost every other location I've been to offers great service. This was disappointing. I worked in the service industry and I know it's not easy and the most rewarding career and I dont want to break anyone's balls here and maybe the issue is above the staff here, maybe it's chain trying to adapt to technology.

Now, the waiters are not the problem but then by the time they come back to make your order right, your food has gotten even colder (and it's not like the food is hot in the first place).

11,Chelsea L.,"Davis, CA",39,6,7.0,2.0,2017-08-04,"I really like Red Robin...just not this location...it literally sucks a**. This Fairfield one seriously needs new management because that is the underlying issue to most of the bad reviews. We checked yelp before going but decided that because we like Red Robin that it should be fine and the negative reviews could just be ignored...NO...don't ignore the bad reviews like we did. It is not worth your time and money to go to this Red Robin.  I went here for a birthday lunch with my fiancé, sister, and her boyfriend around 2:00 pm on Sunday July 30. The person who greeted us as we walked in was super nice and had great customer service.  My sister and I have a couple dietary restrictions that are reasonable to work around at these major chain restaurants. The waitress told us the raspberry iced tea came unsweetened so I ordered that. Upon taking my first sip I was overwhelmed with something akin to liquid sugar...the raspberry tea was clearly not unsweetened. When she returned I requested just a regular unsweetened iced tea because the raspberry one and her response was ""oh its too sweet?"". lightly sweetened and unsweetened are not the same thing....the raspberry iced tea was obviously neither. I can't remember the name but I ordered a black angus fire grilled burger that was one of the higher end burgers available on the menu (~$15). I just wanted a simple burger but this was in the section of the menu where they had ""creative"" selections. By creative I mean they add a bunch of sugar and fat to it.  The burger I ordered originally came with grilled onions, caramelized bacon bits, cheddar cheese, BBQ sauce, and a brown sugar finish to the burger patty. I requested no cheese, bacon, and brown sugar and for it to be wrapped in lettuce...side note: why would you need to add more sugar to a burger by finishing it off with brown sugar? It just shows you how addicted to sugar people are in America.... We waited not 20 minutes for our food, not 30 minutes, but an hour for our food to be delivered. We were about to walk out when our food came. The waitress kept coming by to tell us it was almost ready. She even gave us some ""bottomless"" fries to start on while we waited but the two baskets only had like 10 fries each...10 fries is not really bottomless for four people who are waiting an hour for their food.  Finally when we were about to leave, my sister's boyfriend told the manager we were waiting for almost an hour and voila! our food arrives...how convenient. The food was fine but the customer service by management was horrible. They clearly do not know how to manage if a kitchen takes an hour to cook food. The place was not even busy; several tables were vacant. They didn't even tell us why it took so long but our best guess is they made my order regular and realized it was wrong. One table arrived at the same time as us, ordered the same time but left way before we even got our food. The manager did not even comp anything off our receipt for the inconvenience...apparently 10 ""bottomless"" fries should be satisfactory.  We didn't let the poor overall service that was all on the manager influence the tip for our waitress. She was attentive and provided good service. People like Red Robin and this place would get better reviews if it was more organized and had better leaders for the kitchen staff and the wait staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield?start=20,1.36,1.63,1.572,1.576,1.5220000000000002

We asked if we could have our shakes come with our food but she said, ""Well I'm already entering it in so you'll want it to come when its ready."" How about quit entering in into the tablet and we will order it later...? She was too lazy to do that. So our shakes came 15 mins before our food and we had no choice but to drink them. Then she dropped off our food and never came back. She didn't even get me a chance to say, ""Can we get ranch too."" She ran off. Never stopped by and checked if we needed ANYTHING or if our food was ok. Never asked if we needed refills. I barely got any fries so we wanted to get more, well she never came so we couldn't get any. We sat there for a good half hour eating and nothing.

162,Deborah H.,"Fairfield, CA",0,5,,1.0,2017-08-23,"Visited tonight with the hubby. We entered via the parking lot entrance as two employees exited from a side door conducting a nosy profanity-laced conversation including the F word. Walked inside to find more dirty tables than clean. There were literally more dirty tables than tables with diners. When we told the hostess we wanted to sit in the bar, she handed us our menus and said we could find our way. When we arrived at the bar we were seated at a table that had not been wiped off. When my husband asked the bartender to wipe the table he got some attitude going, grabbed a rag, made a swipe at the table and left us to sit on the last patron's crumbs...next to a dirty dish-covered table to our left that was never bussed during our entire meal. The table of four seated to our right had to reorder missing food items more than once, and due to a lack of attention had to get out of their seats to locate a server for help to rectify their multiple food issues. We began with iced tea and the pretzel bite appetizer, obviously deep-fried, over done on one side and undercooked on the other, with runny lumpy cold cheese sauce for dipping. I ordered the chicken caesar wrap with a cup of clam chowder. The wrap was executed without garnish but otherwise perfect. The soup was served at room temperature and sent back. In addition, the soup was not served in a cup but instead served in a vessel the size of a ranch dressing side. Hubby ordered a cheeseburger which he said was okay, came with bottomless fries. He wasn't offered additional fries until we were finished with our meal. We were never offered iced tea refills. As we were leaving Hubby mentioned to the bartender there were ten dirty tables just in our area. The bartender glanced around and said ""yeah that's about right."" Hubby asked if they had a busser and was told they did, but the bartender had no idea where he was. Next time Hubby wants a good burger we'll need to find a cleaner establishment to visit.

Mind you my burger was not what I had even ordered , it was supposed to have the fried jalapeños on it , the server said oh I'll be right back with some so you can add it on. Where we were sitting there is glass where you can see the expo line & literally watched the server drop them all over the expo line scoop them back up with her hands and bring them to me & acted like I didn't see her doing so. So by this time I asked for a manager and walked out because it seemed like the manager didn't even care! So we tried to come a second time only because my girlfriend wanted to again before a movie , and we literally waited at the front to be seated for about a good 30 mins.

My burger(cheese already looked hardened)  and fries were cold my daughters food was warm. I sent mine back but my daughter was starving so she ate hers, i didnt eat cause didnt want to wait more. I spoke to manager and asked if it was a racial thing cause i see no other reason for our food to take so long and the fact the other families got their food so fast and they ordered same thing as me. He says its not cause they hire all kinds of people, then i asked why would no one bring me my food then? Especially since i had my daughter with me had no answer.

She never introduced herself so I wish I could include her name but I don't know what it is (the servers don't wear name tags). Our salads took forever to come and when they finally did they came without dressing. Upon asking for dressing we got a confused look from the waitress. She asked what kind and one of the salads came with a special dressing so we asked if we could get the special dressing. She didn't know what we were talking about and had to go check. The Caesar salad came with old lettuce and no croutons. The garlic Parmesan fries came with no garlic on it.

My parents were in town visiting from Chicago last weekend and we wanted to go to a decent dinner. We decided on Red Robin because we have been to them back home and it was always good .  We arrived at about 745 pm and waited to be seated. We then were taken to our table and placed our order within a few minutes. Then we waited... and waited .... and waited some more.  They were busy and I understand things happen, but it took almost an hour to get 4 burgers (which were warm) and fries (which were all cold). They were pretty stingy with the ""bottomless "" steak fries and we didn't even ask for more because we didn't want to have to wait again. Our waitress did not check on us once after the food came ..not even to bring the bill.  ****After our meal , I noticed a bug crawl out from the shared bench seat my dad was sitting on.. the bug kept coming closer to my dad so he swatted it away with his phone and it landed on the ground under the table. I realized that I was staring at a cockroach and immediately asked for a manager to come over. My family and i were sick to our stomachs realizing we had just eaten here.  It took about 5 minutes for the manager to finally come over. I showed her the roach and she started apologizing saying that because they are in a mall they get ""critters"" sometimes and she would have the restaurant sprayed that night.  The manager then grabbed the payment kiosk on the table, added a gratuity for the server to our check and charged us full price for the meal! I was sure she would do something besides apologize after what had just happened. But, NOTHING.   I  decided to try and let the restaurant know of the problem by calling the feedback hotline. When I finally spoke to someone  I explained what had happened and the terrible service we received . I asked for our bill to be credited back and not charged for our meal.  The guy on the phone said that wasn't a problem and I would be credited back within a few business days ... it's been a week and still nothing.  It's not the money that matters. THERE IS A SERIOUS MANAGEMENT ISSUE IN THIS RESTAURANT.  AND CLEANLINESS ISSUES OBVIOUSLY.   Nobody at the corporate level even seems to care at all.. nothing has been done to rectify the horrible experience my family and I had .

THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THE WORST. The servers are so SLOW and LAZY. We waited over 30 minutes before someone took our order.  Since we were seated by the kitchen I could see what was going on in the back. I saw our food ready and just sitting there for over 20 minutes while our waitress stood there chatting it up with another waitress, while stuffing their face with fries. I understand that they also need to eat, but they're on the clock. They have breaks for that. By the time we got our food, we were starving. My burger was a little cold to be honest, but I was hungry so I ate it anyway. When I asked our server for a refill on my fries she said ""sure"" and never came back with them. My friend wanted to order a drink later into our meal, but again our server was no where to be found.  After an hour of waiting for our server to return, we decided to just leave. We got so tired of waiting for her that we ended up just playing the bill on the little machine thing on the table. When we were paying, our server finally comes back and asks ""you guys doing good?"" and leaves before we can even reply. Still didn't bring my fries, didn't ask if we wanted refills on our drinks or if we wanted dessert. Nothing. Horrible service.  This location is also really dirty. When we first arrived there, a few tables next to us hadn't been cleaned yet, we were there for over 3 hours and they still didn't clean them.

But still okay.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield,1.56,1.66,1.572,,1.6200000000000003
53,Chris G.,"Fairfield, CA",0,8,,1.0,2017-11-01,"There are so many things wrong with this place I don't know where to begin. This was my husbands only day off -after working for three weeks straight, so we decided to treat ourselves and our family to a nice meal. Before we walked in -from the sidewalk, I noticed how dirty their glass doors were! There were hand marks all over, from top to bottom. My first thought was maybe it is part of the decoration? As we got closer to the glass doors, it became clear that it was indeed greasy hand prints all over. I thought how gross, but maybe they had an energetic little one come in and maybe they hadn't had enough time to clean it all up?  Upon entering, there was no one there to greet us in the waiting area. We waited a few minutes. My kids began playing with their chalk boards. After some more time, I realized no one had heard or seen us walk in -so I approached the manager who was sitting directly across from the entrance ( he was filling out paperwork). I asked him if we needed to go over to the other side of the restaurant (where the entrance from the mall is) to be checked in and wait for a table. He got up immediately, and grabbed us a waitress. It was pretty empty inside.  As we're walking in -I notice dirty napkins laying all over the place. The carpet was very dirty. It looked like it hadn't been vacuumed in days. Our table was sticky. All red flags but we wanted to give this place the benefit of the doubt. Our waitress came by for drinks and to take our order. She never once stopped to pick up that dirty napkin that was laying right in her path. When I received my plate I noticed right away that the cucumbers were old. They looked like clear, green jelly. I picked them out and didn't say anything -because I did not want to complain. I go to add ranch and I notice that the lettuce is brown. Then see that the tomatoes also look old and colorless. As I am picking all the bad bits and pieces out, and mixing the lettuce around -I see hair. I pulled on it, and out came two long, blonde hairs. I called the waitress over. She went to grab the manager. My family and I had all lost our appetites. The fries looked like they had been reheated or re fried. They were dry and stale. We all decided not to eat. In that time that we waited for the manager to come, not once did our waitress come over to talk to us or to at least offer us a refill on our drinks.  After a few minutes go by , the manager finally came to our table. He offered me a new salad, I said no thanks - he offered me fries, I said no thanks. I couldn't imagine eating there anymore.  I told him to take the salad and burger that I had ordered off of my check. He did.  When the manager left our table, we started hearing the cooks hollering loudly and laughing. So disrespectful. The manager never apologized or explained anything to me about why it happened. No one ever came back to check on us. It was completely awkward for us and we all felt bad. We sat there for a few minutes trying to understand what was happening. It was incredibly ridiculous and not expected from such a nice looking restaurant. We decided to leave, but we were trying to take those charges for special sauces that never made it to our table off our bill so we called for our waitress but she did not come for another 3 minutes or so. We had already paid because at that point we were frustrated. All the ladies were turning the other way completely ignoring us.  Our total for this bad service and food was way unfair. It was a nightmare.  We took all the food in boxes because we paid for it -but tossed it as soon as we got home!  For half the price -we got jack in the box and ate that instead.  I felt that the manager should have offered a sincere apology and a discount for the entire check. They ruined our family time. We had so many other options but decided to give Red Robin a chance. This is newly remodeled restaurant and seemed like a good choice at the time -but we were very wrong. This place ruined our evening. The Manager here, really needs to get on top of this mess! Take some management classes and train his staff on customer service, have someone go around cleaning/vacuuming every single morning before opening, wiping all the doors and windows, have staff pick up any garbage they see, clean the tables with some sort of disinfectant, inspect their food, train staff and cooks on proper food handling, train staff how to properly handle these situations to stop customers from feeling uncomfortable and grossed out!  I strongly believe that Food/Health inspectors should randomly go and take a look at this place! The kiosk didn't even have paper to print our receipt, so I'll be double checking to make sure the waitress did not somehow add herself a tip.  $50 thrown away!

First of all wait time for my party was over 30 min, pathetic and honestly there was 1 or 2 more parties with less than 4 people each ahead of me and half the restaurant ro this point is still open to seating. Our server never came to ask for drinks, he just dropped off silverware and came back 15min later to take our order and completely forgot that he never took our drink order. It gets worse, our DRINKS, just drinks took another 15min to get here and he had forgotten what half the drink orders were. They ran out of orange cream for my soda. Note: He's telling me this 20min after I ordered my drink. I think I'll stop here for the ranting because it kept going so Angel please step up your work performance I don't like to point fingers but when it's necessary I have to because I like Red Robin and would like some average service at least for the future if I ever do plan on going. On the good side (the only good thing in the review if you skipped ahead) the food was actually good and it's mever dissapointed so a thumbs up there for the Crispy Chicken Burger along with the other burgers ordered.

42,Andrea G.,"Fairfield, CA",24,14,2.0,1.0,2017-12-19,"I would caution any shoppers at the Solano Mall to look at their food before they eat ... first off, we had to find someone who would seat us. Once we got a booth table, I noticed pizza and other large scraps under the table. There's flags we're flying high but it was late and we decided to stay. Big mistake.  My husband ordered the Bruschetta Chicken sandwich ... he noticed the chicken had an odd taste after a couple of bites and looked at the sandwich - it was raw inside!  We told the server, who seemed nonchalant about it. Although she deducted the meal, we felt the situation could have been dealt more appropriately, such as having the manager come talk to us. In fact, I left my food as well but it wasn't deducted.  So, should you choose to eat at this place, please look closely at your meal. But I would highly recommend you try the other restaurants in the nearby area before settling for RR.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield,1.68,1.63,1.584,,1.6500000000000001
7,Michael P.,"Vallejo, CA",18,62,47.0,1.0,2017-12-21,"I hate writing negative reviews of businesses and establishments, but this one has to be written for the benefit of you (as the customer/consumer), and hopefully (if they take the time to read this) the business/establishment to improve upon.. Anyway, my buddy and I chose to eat here as he had won a gift card from his work. We came around 7pmish on Wednesday and we spoke with the seater about getting a seat. We were sat within 15 mins. The wait did not bother my friend and myself. However... roughly 10-12 mins of being sat down at a table, 2 female customers (arriving after us) sat across from us and within literally 3-5 mins, a waitress had come and attended to them... like wow... really?? My friend and I had looked through the menu which only took 5 mins and we waited to be attended only to have the next table who came after us attended first... not only that, but the podium employee attended to both them and made sure their waitress would serve them. My friend and I just literally watched as this was happening and we made eye contact with both the podium employee and waitress to which we were ignored... heck, even a couple who came shortly after that were attended to in a timely manner. As for me and my friend, we were literally ignored! I'm not one for causing a scene or complaining aggressively, but when two tables that arrive after you get served first, and you have to literally get up and look for the server and waitress to inform them that you haven't been served or attended to just goes to show how lacking they are in service. Finally our waitress came and informed us that no one had told her we were seated (as if making eye contact wasn't enough) she apologized and took our order. While the waitress was nice and apologetic, we did not get any sort of complimentary food/drink/discount for the inconvenience. The food to be honest came out mediocre. The fries were hot outside and crisp, but was cold in the inside. The bacon tavern burger was ok, comparable to a Burger King whopper. My friend had ordered the A1 burger which he said was good but the fries were undercooked as well. We were both really hungry and just decided to not waste the food and it all.. our waitress not once even checked if we needed refills on our water. She did come back one time to ask if we wanted more fries to which we happily declined due to the way things turned out. We couldn't wait to leave. Thank goodness we had the gift card and just used that to pay for the meal. So no money really wasted on our end. I know it was a busy and crowded time, but come on.. I've worked in busy restaurants before and I've always managed to serve tables in proper order. We weren't even asked how we wanted the meat cooked.. not that it mattered anyway but in customer service (especially waitressing and serving) you ask specific things your customers want or don't want. We didn't even get that option. I always like to give the benefit of the doubt and assume that they were busy. However, the way service and food was rendered did not justify that. I felt miserable and totally ignored dining at this Red Robin. When I got home my stomach was feeling upset and without going into excessive detail, my digestive system did not agree with the food either. Upon reviewing , I remembered that the fries were undercooked so that may have had something to do with it. Really, my major complaint is that we were ignored and served last as other tables that arrived after us were served promptly. Followed by the mediocrity of the food. I myself will never return and dine at this specific location in the Solano mall. In the end it's up to you to dine here if you want. I recommend reading the other reviews first before you go. Who knows?? Maybe you'll get better service and quality. If I could, this place would get no stars. 0/10.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairfield?start=20,1.68,1.63,1.584,,1.6500000000000001

Unfortunately (?) for us, as soon as they arrived, a waitress walked past and sat those 2 groups before us. That waitress somewhat acknowledged us that we'd be seated next. Not a big deal, we weren't in a hurry. Next thing we knew, another group came in and a different waitress passed by to get them seated. Oh well, not a big deal... I guess? Guess what! Another set of people came in and the first waitress showed up to seat that set of people, too... Totally dismissing us! We sat there for a bit and looked at each other with our rumbly tummies echoing in unison... ""Yeah, let's go elsewhere..."", we thought to each other.
