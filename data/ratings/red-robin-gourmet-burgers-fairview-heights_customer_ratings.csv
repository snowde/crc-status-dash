31,Nathan S.,"Palmer, AK",3,6,3.0,5.0,2012-04-26,Red Robins never fails me when it comes to burgers!  We went there for lunch and our food came much quicker than I anticipated.  The sweet potato fries were good and of course the royal red robin burger was delicious.  I've been to a lot of restaurants that put a fried egg on their burgers but Red Robin's is still the best!  Thanks for a great meal yet again!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairview-heights?start=40,3.188,3.188,3.188,3.188,3.188
21,Tanya M.,"Cahokia, IL",210,448,66.0,3.0,2012-06-06,"I took the handsome nephew to Red Robin for lunch. I am saddened that they no longer offer salmon. The was one of my favorite things to get was the salmon burger or a salad with salmon.  we got there a little after 11. The other couple that was there when we walked in were sat at a small booth. the nephew and i were seated behind them at a 4 top booth. i really don't understand why she did not seat them at a regular table, unless they asked for a small table. a little after we got there the hostess sat a couple with toddler twins at a booth and moved them once she saw that she could not fit 2 high chairs at a booth. i think the hostess was a bit new.but any who....................... we ordered a small order of cheese sticks. they were hot but the breading was a bit soggy near the cheese, which gave the cheesesticks an off taste. i ordered the cobb salad. i forget what cutesy name they want to give to it. it was very good. i never knew you could order a half salad. i will have to remember that in the future. I also ordered the roasted veggie soup. it was ok but being broth based I needed crackers and it was not very warm to begin with. i sipped on it til my salad came to the table.  The best part was stealing a few of my nephews bottomless fries!!!!!!!!!!!!!  someone elses fries always taste better. the service was fine. the waitress was friendly but lacked being attentive when we needed her.   i know that the floor plan of the restaurant magnifies sound. I have been to several Red Robins and once you get kids in there screaming it can raise your blood pressure. It is Red Robin so i know i will be back just for the bottomless fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairview-heights?start=40,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004

In fact, my last 2 visits to RR have been less than impressive. If I had only eaten at this chain the last two times, I'd not go back.

First negative was the noise.  Second was the disappointment in my beer selection.  The waiter mentioned they had the new Oktoberfest in.  Since this is late August I never thought they would be out, but he returned shortly to advise they were.  Ok, made a second selection of beer, which was good, but not what I had my mind on.  Meals were ordered, and almost there, when the waiter came back and I ordered another beer and water for the meal.  Food came.....no beer, no drink.  Waiter came back and said they ran out of the beer I had just had.  I told him to cancel the beer, as he said they were changing kegs, and bring me water.  No water....no water....no water, so I ended up sharing my wife's soda.  Then, just as I was almost finished with my food, the waiter came with the beer and water.  I told him I had cancelled the beer and I did not want it, as I was now finished with the burger and almost with fries.   Manager did come by to apologize ""for the hic-up"" as she said.  I told her was only disappointed with the beer service, and nothing else.  We were not looking for something free or for them to discount anything, and sure did not get offered anything on our return, if we should.  I doubt that we will.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairview-heights?start=40,2.9160000000000004,2.9160000000000004,2.9160000000000004,2.9160000000000004,2.9160000000000004

Every time my mom would take me here for lunch, it was all I could bring myself to order. Times (and their menu) have definitely changed. They offer a veggie burger (and a vegan Boca burger) and they are more than willing to swap out one of their specialty burgers for you. I cannot remember the name of it, but they have an entree that is substantially spicy. Breaded jalapenos, spicy sauce -- the works. It's amazing and never ceases to knock my tastebuds' socks off. Although my tiny stomach does not benefit from this, I must note, their super thick, delicious fries are BOTTOMLESS. Eat all you want and they will refill your fries for you!

0,Desiree M.,"Dayton, OH",198,398,704.0,3.0,2013-08-08,"The only reason Red Robin gets three stars first off is because of their prices, I think they are ridiculously high.  I used to frequent here in Alaska and get there kids meals for myself because the portions of salads and what not are just ridiculously huge.  They should have a little bites or smaller portions on the menu, because if someone wanted a hamburger that didn't want to eat 4000 calories in one burger should have the chance to eat here. My hubby got a hamburger and at the end after adding a few things to it ended up being $14 and some change.  I ended up getting the southwest chicken wrap with chili.  It was okay for a chicken wrap, i think it lacked in flavor.  The chili was really spicy and okay. I do like the atmosphere of red robin, its fun and vibrant.  The servers are usually pretty good.  This is just not my most fav place in the world, but again im not a huge meat eater either.

I've been here several times and never really had ""bad service"" during my visits, just slightly slow due to lunch and dinner rush times (11-1pm) and (5-7 pm) during the week days.

26,Stan D.,"Maryville, IL",9,21,125.0,4.0,2014-09-06,"This is NOT the best burger nor the cheapest by far. It IS a good thick burger that you can order from medium-rare to well-done with tasty bottomless fries. The quality of the beef and other ingredients is very good. You have a large variety of burgers to choose from in different sizes and with different toppings, from the classic cheeseburger or patty melt to the A1 Peppercorn and Banzai burger, and everything in between. They also serve a variety of fried and grilled chicken burgers and a cod fillet. They have a handful of dipping sauces to choose from. My favorite is the campfire sauce. If you're in the mood for a salad, they have several nice ones to choose from. One of my favorites is the southwest grilled chicken salad that comes topped with fried jalapeño coins, avocado, cheddar, black beans, bell peppers, onions, roasted corn and tortilla strips with salsa-ranch. Finally, they have a full bar to choose from; beer, margaritas, wines and cocktails. Red Robbin has a nice casual ambiance that I think you'll like. If you're looking for a better than average burger and a nice beverage to wash it down with, you can't go wrong here. P.S.

Will Red Robin refund or rescind this kind of charge if the kiddies get on and click on something that add to my bill? $2 doesn't break my bank, but I don't appreciate a charge like this unless I approve it. If my kid orders something from the waitress I have the option of over ruling if don't want them to have that.  With this Ziosk machine I find it a sneaky way to add to your bill.

I had it open faced to save some calories and opted for a side salad instead of fries.  I love all of the new options RR has in order to save calories or for a little something different.  Check it out, great options, some are an additional cost, but well worth it.  My husband had the Smoke and Pepper burger.  He said it was very juicy and spicy, but not too much.  He also got more fries since they are all you can eat!  I recommend becoming a member of the Red Robin Royalty club to get discounts on meals.  We were able to save 20% on our meal using that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairview-heights,3.6,3.6,3.6,,3.6000000000000005

Just disappointed with the service, again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairview-heights,3.36,3.36,3.36,,3.3600000000000003
49,Lori G.,"O'Fallon, IL",0,11,11.0,3.0,2016-12-06,The service was fairly slow but this server was friendly and nice. The food was acceptable with no complaints except the grilled cheese sandwich was fairly burnt on one side.  My main reason for not giving it more stars is because of check out. If you're not paying cash you have to check yourself out at your table because they are too cheap to pay a person to check you out with your credit card. I'm not going out to dinner to do their job for them.  The machine would not work for anyone in our party and we could no longer get our server back to our table. We got our cash together and left it on the table. This was a very disappointing way to end our meal.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairview-heights,3.32,3.32,3.32,,3.3200000000000003
42,Sharah C.,"Belleville, IL",34,63,194.0,3.0,2016-12-09,"I was hungry and wanted a burger so i thought I'd revisit this place. Havent been here in years. They once had a fav appetizer of mine (the rib tips), but I see they have been removed from the menu.  I ordered the smoke & pepper burger. The menu hypes this bad boy up. I made some substitutions like having the burger on the standard sesame seed bun, sharp cheddar instead of extra sharp, and adding carmelized onions. The burger was ok. Cooked perfectly, the bacon was wimpy, it looked thick cut in the picture.  Service was so so. Server was friendly, but I never got my refill of steak fries because she stood around chatting it up with another table and by then I was done with the burger. Le sigh. Will return eventually but I wont be chomping  at the bit to do so. It served its purpose..I wasnt hungry anymore. ***Update**** Now that I think over my dining experience..this place is way too expensive.  My ""gourmet"" angus beef hamburger with an addition of carmelized onions, fries, added a garlic sauce for dipping, and a soda came to $19!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairview-heights,3.28,3.28,3.28,,3.2800000000000002

When our hostesses sat us ... 15 seconds later was when we saw our waitress told her told as I finished sitting down I not even opened the menu to see what's in it as she suggested onions something so fast I guessed it was rings .. Then a football quarter later she came to take our Oder then told us after the.

39,Michelle L.,"Saint Louis, MO",68,1007,1635.0,4.0,2017-05-10,"I've actually grown to really like Red Robin.  For the second time I ordered the Smoky Jack Tavern Double (Smoky Campfire Sauce, our bourbon-infused Whiskey River® BBQ sauce and melted Pepper-Jack cheese with pickles, red onions and lettuce on a sesame seed bun.) This is a much smaller burger than most of the regular ones on their menu. It's perfect for me! I mean who doesn't like their fries? Ask for them extra crispy! My Father really likes the salmon sandwich. I'm pretty confident this will be part of our regular lunch rotation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairview-heights,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006

I love their veggie burgers and endless fries. Also, can't forget chipotle mayo.. my fave! I got the Burnin Love with the veggie burger and was so satisfied. The restaurant itself is an average chain place and the service is cool.

34,Bryan S.,"Edwardsville, IL",2,112,42.0,4.0,2017-07-16,"We had a really great meal at Red Robin. Restaurant was pretty crowded which made it very loud.  The parking wasn't too bad because they have a huge locked. It's a little difficult to get to, in one of the mall shopping centers. For an appetizer, we had the barbecue pork loaded chips. I was a little bit hesitant but they were great.  For my meal, I had the teriyaki chicken sandwich.  It is absolutely one of my favorite sandwiches.  We also had a BLT on croissant. It was huge.   Our server was Andrew D. He did a great job.   I do not like the kiosks to pay your bill. Once again, ours had no paper for the receipt.   The restrooms weren't spotless but they were adequately clean for a lunchtime meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairview-heights,3.32,3.32,3.32,,3.3200000000000003

41,Julie W.,"Mascoutah, IL",10,1,,4.0,2017-08-10,Red Robin has good burgers and the tastiest fries around! The campfire sauce is to die for! The only complaint is that they are stingy with the fries.

35,Karen H.,"Collinsville, IL",18,9,1.0,1.0,2017-11-25,"My husband and I went at 12:15 on Black Friday. We were put on a wait list and told 20 minutes. Groups of 3 or more were getting seated ahead of us. We were told that parties of 2 had to wait for a table for 2., I knew that we would have to wait, no problem. After 40 minutes, I was told that there were 5 parties ahead of us (four parties of only 2). I said that this was not acceptable. We were seated at a booth in the bar. The overworked waitress had large parties and it took a while to order and receive our food. My macaroni and cheese arrived cold. It took 15 minutes for the waitress to appear and that was only because my husband waved her down. It took another 15 minutes for a new casserole to arrive.  The caeser salad was drowned in dressing, the lettuce was soft and warm. The manager delivered the replacement,macaroni and said ""I don't know why your food was sent back.""  2 1/2 hours! Miserable. No reason to seat parties of 2 at small tables only. There are only a few small tables so our wait is much longer!! Side note: fancy lemonade drinks are served in such small, fancy shaped glasses that it is very inefficient method. The waitress spent more time running for drink refills at larger tables that small parties were neglected.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fairview-heights,3.32,3.32,3.32,,3.3200000000000003

We had been eating hamburgers at just about every place before visiting my sister so we decided to have something other than what their specialty was. They both had burgers, and seemed to enjoy it. My husband had the chicken wrap. I had the boneless chicken wings. They were SO GOOD. I can still remember what they taste like. My sister had also gotten for the table one of those big tall onion ring spikes in the center of the table. That was fun with all of us eating an onion ring here and there. The atmosphere was nice.
