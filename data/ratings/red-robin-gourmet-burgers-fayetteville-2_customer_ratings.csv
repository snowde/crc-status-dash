14,R H.,"Fayetteville, AR",128,572,96.0,4.0,2012-02-26,"Great Chain!   Wait a minute....   Great Chain?...  Yes it's true this place(at least this location) is usually pretty good.  The service struggles from time to time, as does the bar and the timing from the kitchen, but that's a typical chain for you.   The burgers, onion rings, chicken wings, milkshakes are excellent! Everything else is pretty good. Fries are not good if you are a fry snob, and even my 18 month old passes on them unless they are soaked in ranch or ketchup.   If fries are not an important part of your meal, then you'll love em' If this place was not a chain it would receive 3 stars for the above mentioned aspects, however, I feel chains almost are unable to break away from these issues, because of over management and under experience. Did I mention the shakes?  Really, Really, Really good.  Vanilla icecream with choc. syrup blended very thick, they fill your huge glass cover it with whipped cream, and a cherry, then deliver the mixing cup with another equally huge portion of ""the rest"" of your shake.   This place also has a full bar.  Bar service is usually pretty slow, and they don't hire real bartenders, just servers who are old enough to stand behind the bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fayetteville-2,,,,,
13,Kat T.,"Plano, TX",13,87,15.0,3.0,2013-12-26,We enjoyed our lunch overall. Our waiter was good. This chain inputs your allergy in the computer which makes me feel a bit safer about eating there. Thy also have an allergen menu.  One of our meals did come out wrong and I was disappointed but I didn't want to wait for a new one. So I was just going to eat it and the waiter went out of his way to fix the problem. The manager apologized an took it off out bill. So we paid the same and tipped the waiter the cost of the meal.  I did get the impression they have a lot of mistakes in the kitchen but I'd probably still go back when I'm in town.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fayetteville-2,,,,,
10,Jared K.,"Little Rock, AR",314,616,141.0,3.0,2014-07-13,"This was my first time at a Red Robin, so I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. In my mind I pictured something akin to Burger King, but this was thankfully much nicer than that. It had all the ambiance of a Ruby Tuesday with a modern college-town twist. It was also freezing cold inside, and I'm generally pretty warm-natured. Eventually they turned the air down a little, but it was still rather chilly. I tried their new Black & Bleu Burger: sauteed blackened portobello mushrooms, grilled onions, house-made bleu cheese sauce, and bleu cheese crumbles on a toasted ciabatta bun with Dion sauce. It also comes with their standard bottomless steak fries. The fries had a nice seasoning and were really tasty. I must have been a bit confused about the ""bottomless"" descriptor, which apparently just meant the container in which the fries come has no bottom. Hmm. My burger was cooked more medium-well than my requested medium. It was flavorful and juicy though. I loved the ciabatta bread in terms of taste, but it was a bit soggy, even the top bun which sat off by itself. The bleu cheese had a nice bite, but there weren't as many crumbles as I was expecting. Overall, the burger was really salty, especially with the added bleu cheese sauce. Red Robin was much better than fast food, but I've definitely had better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fayetteville-2,,,,,
11,Curt W.,"Fayetteville, AR",21,95,5.0,2.0,2015-02-25,"If price doesn't matter, then this is a great place to dine.  Food is good, service is normally average or better.  I'm giving two stars, because I think Red Robin is priced like gourmet food, but to me, they are just a good burger joint.  I like good burger joints, but I can get this quality of food for a lower cost and equal experience elsewhere.  I have friends who endorse the ""gourmet"" tag and corresponding price at this restaurant - I just don't agree.  But I'll likely continue to dine here with them anyhow...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fayetteville-2,,,,,
12,Aaron F.,"Fayetteville, AR",13,15,17.0,2.0,2015-03-08,Atmosphere was very cold as it was outside. Lots of loud music and machines in the bar.  The burger was average. Nothing really to write home about.  Place is kind of expensive for burgers when there is 50 other burger places that are nicer and less expensive.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fayetteville-2,,,,,
9,James D.,"Fayetteville, AR",94,250,83.0,5.0,2015-11-12,THANK YOU for a wonderful Veterans Day meal. I love hamburgers and always enjoy eating here. It was very special to me that the managers and several servers came by to thank me for my service. You helped make my day extra special.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fayetteville-2,,,,,
7,Lo R.,"Bella Vista, AR",230,281,156.0,4.0,2016-07-06,"This is the place for Burgers !!  This is where my wife and I like to come for our guilty burger pleasures. And they never disappoint.  They recently updated their menus and did a little bit of re-branding. Looks good I must say.  The food is always on point. I added a few jalapeño coins to my AI Peppercorn burger. Delish!  Only downside was our server. She was kind of a doop. Seemed to be in lala land.  Other down side are those stupid little game machine thingies they have on ur table. BEWARE- if ur little one gets a hold of them and starts a game up, you will be liable to a 2$ ""entertainment fee"". Which we got waved because my wife likes to look at the receipts before we pay. Ludicrous.   The food and beer make up for it all tho. But could defensively of been a better experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fayetteville-2,,,,,
5,Brent M.,"Fayetteville, AR",53,79,11.0,5.0,2016-07-10,Great place for lunch! Willing to go back customer service and place was great get drunk there-they don't care even at 11 am -food was as pictured in the menu and local can knows where it's at!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fayetteville-2,,,,,
4,Sharon D.,"Farmington, AR",15,31,184.0,4.0,2016-11-13,We went for Veterans Day special.  I had the Western Burger and sweet potatoe Fries.  All of the food was hot and the service was great.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fayetteville-2,,,,,
8,John R.,"Springdale, AR",10,31,,3.0,2017-05-17,"I have been here multiple times over the years. The food is good and they do have really good fries. My main beef, no pun intended, is that I think the prices are to high for what you are getting. Don't get me wrong, the food is better than a standard burger place but not quite fitting for the prices.  I don't think I'll be going back much anymore for that reason. But it is usually pretty crowded so take that for what it's worth. The milkshakes were very good, food is the same, service was ""ok"", and the atmosphere is pretty loud.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fayetteville-2,,,,,
6,Amanda W.,"Fayetteville, AR",121,32,8.0,5.0,2017-06-09,"Absolutely wonderful service! The food is good, the Marco Pollo was amazing. Bottomless fries! Great place for kids with the bottomless mac and cheese and sides. Our waitress was so friendly and attentive! Will definitely be going back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fayetteville-2,,,,,
2,Samuel G.,"Fayetteville, AR",170,25,16.0,5.0,2017-09-27,"Great service. Loved them bringing fries out as we were waiting for the rest of the party to arrive. Ordered the burger with an egg and it accidentally slipped off the burger before it was served, so I had to wait for my food while everyone around me were eating theirs. The manager apologized and said they would bring it out soon. I had no problem with it because they were apologetic, but when they gave my meal to me for free I just had to get on here and say how good their service was. The burger was good too!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fayetteville-2,,,,,
0,Ian J.,"Fort Scott, KS",0,7,,5.0,2017-10-07,"I am already a big fan of Red Robin. I have put so many A1 Peppercorn burgers in my body that it's a wonder I am any semblance of a reasonably healthy male. So my wife and I pretty much knew what we were in for when we stopped by this particular store.  I don't usually do reviews for national chains (y'all don't need a Yelp reviewer tell you how awful Captain D's is) but I was compelled to do so after our visit. If you come to this RR, I would highly suggest requesting a young man named Tristan as your waiter. He was fantastic. Very funny and friendly. We both had specifications to our orders and he was patient and happy to accommodate us. He also seemed to get us anything we needed before he was asked. I down those steak fries like they're going out of style (not likely, amirite?), and when I had finished my first serving he had another batch cooking for us. Our appetizer was burnt and so he got us another and took the item off of our ticket. Guys, Tristan is just a guy who has it figured out.  If we are ever in the area, we are certainly coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fayetteville-2,,,,,
3,Tony W.,"Dover, AR",0,20,,3.0,2017-11-18,"Food was good but overpriced. Service was ok. Drinks are way too expensive, at least mine was. Waitress argued with me and wouldn't fix her error of overcharging me.  Probably won't go back. There are better places for that $$.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fayetteville-2,,,,,
1,Paul P.,"Fayetteville, AR",0,1,,5.0,2018-01-06,"Ordered to-go and it was excellent. Order was spot on, friendly service at pick up and everything was accurate. The hostess even gave us a cup of fries for the ride. Food was delicious. Great carryout experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fayetteville-2,,,,,
