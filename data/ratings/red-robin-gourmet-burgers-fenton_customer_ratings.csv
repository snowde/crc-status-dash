38,Thad J.,"Fenton, MO",39,74,12.0,4.0,2012-07-11,"We took my sister and her two teenagers out for dinner on a Saturday night. The place was busy but not packed. Our server, Tina, passed our table once telling us she would be right back. When Tina returned, we were ready with our drink and food orders. I asked for an order of Onion Strings as an appetizer. This is not on the menu but Tina happily made the substitution. The appetizers came out quickly and included two plates of Onion Strings. We quickly emptied the plates and Tina had another plate ready for us. The burgers arrived and Tina not only remembered everyone's orders but all the special requests were fulfilled, (no onions, alternate cheese, etc). Of course the burgers were delicious. It's what Red Robin does best and we were not disappointed. A minor complaint: the Bacon on the Bacon Cheeseburger was undercooked.  Tina never let our glasses get empty before refills were brought to the table. Even though she had a full section, Tina made us feel like we were her special guests. The food was terrific, the service was exceptional and we had a great time at this Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fenton?start=20,2.9600000000000004,2.9600000000000004,2.9600000000000004,2.9600000000000004,2.9600000000000004

You can add most things on free. You get unlimited fries. You will spend about as much as you would if you went to any other sports bar. All Red Robins i have been LOUD.  I don't know if it is the open floor plan + the blaring music + screaming kids/babies. but this is the one thing that is keeping them from 4 stars. I will say the service has gotten a lot better since i first went to this location. the first few times the waitress would bring my soup then turn around and bring my sandwich. NOT cool. i do not like it all together.  They did discontinue the sandwiches i liked the most. the pot roast sandwich and the salmon sandwich.

I have tried several burgers on the menu, but my all time favorite would have to be the bacon cheeseburger, cooked well, with American cheese and extra crispy bacon. the fries that come with it are awesome seasoned fries, and if you can eat the amount in the basket, you can actually get more free (endless bowl)  they have a nice list of appetizers, with my favorite being the tower of onion rings, they are tasty and crunchy and golden, served with 2 dipping sauces. The service is always satisfying, guess I get lucky. their frequent diner club is nice, you get free things when you accumulate points, and its not hard to do that.

I have been there at least a half dozen times and every time the wife and I leave, we ask ourselves, ""Why the hell did we eat here?"". The burgers are always dry and the fries and  the tower of onion rings are always greasy.   Fact: All Red Robins are built in the epicenter of their local breeding grid.   We always experience unruly children freaking the hell out and peering over the tops of our adjoining booths staring at us, the uncomfortable childless couple  trying to choke down their dry bland burger and greasy fries.  The parents just siting doing nothing the whole time except trying to impress the other couple they are having lunch with by telling them that little Hannah or Dillon is gifted because they can draw a stick figure, personally I'm not impressed.

29,Joey W.,"Arnold, MO",949,286,74.0,4.0,2013-05-13,"I am a sometimes regular at Red Robin, either the one in Fenton, MO or the one off of Manchester.  I could say that this establishment caters to both kids and adults. A more upscale version of McDonald's, well, without the clown. There are a variety of different speciality burgers at this joint, including a variety of different options. Don't like beef? Try your burger as a boca version. It will lower the amount of calories consumed. Trying to cut carbs? Choose a bunless version and avoid the bottomless fries and choose a salad instead.  There are also a variety of different liquors to choose from, so the adult can get his beer on while the kid chows down on gourmet goodness. The only negatives to this place is that its loud....way loud. There are a ton of kids that do come to this place, so if you are not a kid person, I would advise to stay away, or go to a location that allows outdoor seating.  Otherwise, I do recommend that you at least try this establishment. Its a bit more expensive than most standard burger joints, but you do get what you pay for. And you will leave this place more stuffed than a thanksgiving turkey.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fenton?start=20,2.9280000000000004,2.9280000000000004,2.9280000000000004,2.9280000000000004,2.928000000000001

This burger was pre-formed, did not have the teriyaki flavor it used to have. The teriyaki was just poured on the burger along with the other fixings. A very poor example of a $7.00 burger.

We haven't gone to a Robin in some time because I just haven't been in the mood lately. I certainly appreciate the unlimited fries, but that usually leads to a terrible stomach ache that just isn't worth it. Also, we've found some awesome local places that have incredible burgers - Quincy, Layla, Grapeseed - and I'd prefer to spend my money there instead of a chain. Not to mention, eat a fantastic burger instead of an ok burger. However, every once in a while we end up stopping. Like the other night - we were in Fenton, we were starving and we didn't feel like driving all the way back into town and then eating. We wanted to eat ASAP. It was a Friday night around 8p and they told us it would be about a ten minute wait. We probably only waited about 5 minutes. The waitress was super friendly and understanding - she took our orders right away. She even brought our fries and broccoli out first as soon as it was ready! We snacked until our burgers arrived with more!  I would definitely recommend signing up for their rewards program. After you buy 10 items, you get one free!

We didn't like it but hey we were seated. It was very cold in the bar area. People were putting their coats back on. Outside it was in the teens.

There was so little meat that I took some toppings off just so I could taste the burger. Host was friendly and talkative. Waitress was helpful and very efficient.

Our choice was to wait longer for another table or settle for a booster.  Three hungry kids in tow, we opted for the booster. I have to say that we have had this same waiter before a few times, and each time, it's been a bad experience.  This time took the cake, though! Literally! We forewent ordering cake because of the sheer pain of having to wait for him to bring it.  Our food took forever.  Asked for Thai sauce for the fries and a bottle of ketchup, and received Teriyaki and NO ketchup! (I finally borrowed one from a neighboring table).  Drinks barely got refilled until the end of the meal. Limitless fries and fruit salad were almost nonexistent.  The check took forever, and we couldn't even escape by using the annoying little game box thingy because it was broken. Pain. Ful. I'm sure this guy was busy (he told us he was at least a thousand times).  I'm sure they were slammed (though not by 9 pm, when we were STILL THERE). But, come on!  It can't ALWAYS be the kitchen's fault, or the lack of staff, or whatever other excuse he dished out.   Also, the floors were extremely wet.  Everywhere.

28,Em H.,"Ballwin, MO",0,34,1.0,1.0,2016-10-04,After having a bad experience here a few months back I decided to give it another go. Hubby and I went for lunch around 2 and were sat fairly quickly although the hostess and a server (whos mouth was full of food) argued for a few minutes to decide where to seat us. We had the bartender as our server which is never a good thing. We put in an order for an appetizer and waited about 15 minutes for the server to come back to take our order. Another 10 minutes or so and a different person brought out or appetizer. It was cold. We asked the server for sauce which she never brought. She really seemed interested in getting hubs more beer though. As we waited and waited we couldn't help but notice the 6 or so servers who were all sitting in the bar area eating the whole time we were there. What the heck red robin? When the food FINALLY came it was also cold and the portions of fries were miniscule. Also one of my fries had a wooden skewer stuck through it. What the hell? Are your workers that bored that they play with customers food? We asked again for the sauce we wanted from another server and got it. Finally we had enough and paid the bill on the kiosk. Needless to say the tip was not 20% but the service deserved less than 10%. As we walked out our server gave us a nasty look. Sorry fenton red robin but we are done with you.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fenton?start=20,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005

3,Patrick S.,"Imperial, MO",19,20,,1.0,2016-11-15,"Overpriced and skimpy. This is one of the most overrated burger joints, the fries we got were cold the salsa and chips and guacamole lol they serve you a tiny cup of salsa and a tiny cup of guac when you order extra it comes in even a smaller cup than the first. The pig out burger has a whole two strips of bacon and the endless fries are only endless when they actually remember to bring them and they wait till you swipe your card to come ask how nice I would rather go to Bob's Drive In on Jeffco better burger hot fries and made to order unlike this red rob on where the fries are waiting for you and they put one slice of lettuce on the burger  RIP OFF    oh and $2.23 for a drink your luck to get refilled once  RED ROBBIN THEY GOT THE NAME RIGHT",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fenton,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96
9,Kelly A.,"Fenton, MO",0,8,2.0,2.0,2017-02-25,"So, I decided to give this another chance.  A mistake.  I was weak.  I got a coupon in the mail for $4 off $10.   First, at 1:15 my wait was supposed to be 10 minutes.  Okay, I get it...this is an estimate that depends on other diners to move along.  TWENTY-FIVE minutes later I am sent a text that my table was ready.  Make my way to the hostess stand and....Oops...we don't have a table.  Back to waiting.  Never mind that I watched a whole waiting area of people cycle thru 1 1/2 times.  But hey, I was just a party of one, not 4 or 5. Finally, am told they have a table.  I quickly order & the burger comes out.  I order the bacon cheese burger with an addition of blue cheese.  You know the strong, distinctive tasting cheese?  I SAW a couple small crumbles but tasted none.  Up charge of $1.50 wasted.  The burger was unremarkable.  The fries were barely warm.  I mean seriously close to room temperature.  I should have ordered the bottomless broccoli.

5,Stacie S.,"Arnold, MO",4,33,,5.0,2017-03-07,"A few months ago my family decided to try Red Robin.  Normally a place that serves just burgers isn't my thing, I like variety.  Man, am I glad we gave this place a try, I am in love with their Gourmet Burger.  The staff is friendly and the food is always good.  My husband has gotten the Royal Burger (with an egg on the burger patty), sometimes the yolk is overcooked so it's not runny, but it's not a deal breaker.  I've taken the family back several times.  I was surprised at how many different burgers they had.  If you like burgers give this place a try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fenton,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005
8,Mr  G.,"Arnold, MO",0,11,,1.0,2017-04-01,"These are gourmet burgers ??? Fool me!! Mc Donalds have better burgers and a lot cheaper. Went here tonight. BIG mistake. Sat in the bar area. Had the strawberry lemonade for 4.49. Whata rip off. 4.49 for lemonade I had the smoky jack burger. Not too bad but a bigmac has more flavor. Endless fry , yes I said fry. Never offered more for the ""endless"" portion. Wife had the nachomg. OMGis the right name for these. Mostly just chips and very little toppings. Also had the fried pickle nickels. VERY greasy. Service was almost nonexistent after we got our food. Paid at the kiosk and didn't get a receipt. Pushed the server button and after awhile he showed up. Told him we didn't get a receipt. He went to the bar and got one. Seemed put out that we asked him for this. TRUST me!!!!! We won't be back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fenton,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96

11,Top O.,"Saint Louis, MO",0,36,,2.0,2017-07-05,I really like Red Robin but my experience yesterday at the Bluffs was not the best.  Mainly the waitress was not on the ball mentally. We got our appetizers before the drinks arrived ( I think she forget about our drink order and getting a check took too long). Doubt if she will stay a waitress there long. There was something about the pepper smoke burger that was lacking compared to the last time we ordered that burger.  Onion rings and fries still great.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fenton,3.08,3.08,3.08,,3.0800000000000005
1,Leslie E.,"Fenton, MO",0,1,,1.0,2017-10-22,"I will never go back. I have been several times to mediocre service but this was mind boggling. I ordered online for my wife and I. I ordered for myself a double tavern burger (up charge for second patty) & upcharge for bacon. I pick it up & get home, single normal burger no bacon, no BBQ sauce. I call restaurant and talk to a manager tell him in painful detail what I ordered (double patty, bacon, sauce) he says to give him 15 min and he'll replace for free. I go back up to pick up and this time it's got bacon and sauce, but still single patty. I didn't even say anything, I just took it & left. At least I got two patties and bacon between the two burgers. Apparently the order was to difficult to get right in two tries. I'll never go back which is sad because it's within walking distance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fenton,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004

Then when we were waiting for our food to come to the table we played the little computer trivia game but didn't find out till we went to pay our bill that there was a $2.00 entertainment charge added to our bill for playing the trivia game.
