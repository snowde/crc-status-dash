208,Sam A.,"Oklahoma City, OK",12,106,13.0,5.0,2012-01-04,This place is great!  Service is generally friendly and quick.  I visit this place often and I'm very happy with it.   The burgers are good but they have a large enough selection of non-burger items that it keeps me coming back.  They have a few really good salads and their chicken sandwiches are good too.  I've never tried their desserts.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-foothill-ranch?start=180,3.4,3.4,3.4,3.4440000000000004,3.4000000000000004

207,Liz H.,"Irvine, CA",15,167,22.0,4.0,2012-01-21,"I eat at Red Robin occasionally before I go to the movies. Usually the experience isn't too bad. The food is consistently tasty and the service is hit or miss. I got on here, however, to applaud our waitress, Sybil, who served us last time. It was extremely busy and when we had been seated, we waited about four minutes before she appeared, extremely apologetic, and explained that tables had gotten switched and nobody had told her. Our drinks promptly appeared and she took our orders. She was very polite and friendly in spite of being very obviously harried, and our service was top notch from that point on. Even though there was a bit of a wait for our food because the kitchen was backed up, we didn't mind because she was so sincere in her friendliness and explaining exactly what was going on. This particular night I wasn't too pleased with my food but I was so pleased by her sweetness I didn't mind. Thank you, Sybil, for making the experience all the better for me.

232,Sharon T.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",6,3,1.0,1.0,2012-04-01,"I just had dinner at Red Robin  tonight with my children. I find it odd that some children would get offered balloons and others (like my son) would not. The waitress was good, she kept checking up on us to see if we are ok. Towards the end of the dinner, I got up from the table and my purse fell out along with its contents. While I was picking up my stuff, my 4 year old son wondered a bit and got close to the man with the small tub bussing the table. To make story short he hit my son on the eye with the side of his tub. He didn't even bother to turn around and apologize, that is just plain rude. My son was really hurt and I was, of course upset. I was trying to look for the bus boy, but he quickly disappeared. On the way out, I told the hostess what had happened and she just looked at me as if she does not care. She just said okay and no apologies. That to me, is just plain rude. I don't think we are going to be dining here in a looooong or until their service improves. Well, probably never. Oh, food is mediocre and the portions are getting smaller by the minute. I made a mistake of coming out here tonight. I should've listened to my daughter and dined at  Islands Restaurant instead.  No wonder this place is always empty.

This visit I was sitting at the bar and probably ordering a Corona a little early (11:30am) but I didn't care, I was thirsty dammit!   Happily, the bartender was responsive to my request and the race was on to quench my thirst! :) After checking into the various social media channels, which I seem to do before even looking at a menu (though not before quenching my thirst), suddenly there is a tip in Foursquare from Sukhraj B. to check out the Chicken Caesar Wrap. I take a look at the menu for the Chicken Caesar Wrap.  Hmmm, it sounds rather tasty.  I'll go for it! :) The bartender comes back over and I tell her I would like to try the Chicken Caesar Wrap.  She quickly looks at my Corona and before she could ask, I requested another. :) So I sat and relaxed for a few, enjoying my Corona and watching ESPN on the little TV which was reporting on the recent New Orleans Bounty aftermath.   Soon, my Chicken Caesar Wrap with bottomless Steak Fries arrived!  The wrap was delicious!  And the steak fries.. well, as usual very tasty!  Granted, I skip any dipping sauce and just enjoy them plain ... with a side of Corona.

We always enjoy the food here and especially the endless steak fries, but this particular night, despite the lack of customers, we just couldn't seem to get our food. After what seemed like forever, the manager came over and alerted us to the fact that our waiter had forgotten to put in out food order but it would be out soon. As you can imagine, with a two year old this was a near crisis, because she was pretty hungry. He rushed her order out, brought out some fries and carrot sticks with ranch while we were waiting. Overall we were OK with the wait because he was really accommodating us while we waited. We finally got out meal and it was great as always. The real surprise came when the manager brought the bill and it had been completely taken care of, something we never would have expected despite the wait. The customer service we experienced at this Red Robin was nothing short of exceptional. You must visit this location and I assure you that even if something goes wrong, you will be taken care of immediately and that is the reason we will continue to be customers.

We stopped in for lunch on 10/13/12 as we had been shopping nearby.  Was greeted with a friendly & cheerful welcome and our server was at our table promptly after we were seated. All was good - burgers, etc....what the real topping was when I ordered coffee.  Now I don't usually drink coffee in the afternoon but it just sounded good.  Our server said she would be glad to brew a fresh pot. A few minutes later the manager came to our table and apologized for their coffee machine being out of order.  I can deal with that...I said ""it's fine, really.""  However, the manager then offered to ""go across the street to the coffee shop and get me a coffee...""  I looked at her like ""where's the joke"" but she was serious. She said ""we truly value customer service so we go above and beyond.""  I was so amazed at this!  I thanked her so much for the very kind offer but really did not need a cup of coffee that bad.  Our overall impressions were - the food is fine, but this place total is top notch for customer service - they really do aim to please.

For a Friday night, the place wasn't busy which was nice. We knew we wouldn't wait long for our food :)   We go inside and are then seated to our table.  As we were making our way to the table, my friend asked if we could sit somewhere else (away from the area where everyone will be walking by) and the Host said ""sure"".  And he showed us to another table with no problems.  Our waitress, Leticia came over and welcomed us back to Red Robin.  She took our drink orders. I ordered a lemonade and my friend ordered an ice tea.  I just have to say that I love their lemonade. She brings our drinks and takes our order.  I get the Gourmet Cheeseburger plain, well done. My friend ordered the same but with everything on it and medium well. He also asked that his fries be well done too ... where they are crispy. Shortly after, Leticia brings our food.  She places mine down in front of me and it looks delicious as always.  As she places my friends basket down, she tells him that the fries will be out in a couple of minutes.  She just wants to make sure they come out the way he wants them.  A couple minutes later, she brings out a basket of fries and asks if they are crispy enough for him.  By the looks of it, I would have thought yes, but for him, they weren't.  She smiled and said ""no problem"" and she went back to the kitchen and ask for another basket but for them to be a little more crispy.  A couple minutes later, she comes back out and they are crispy enough for my friend.   Leticia also mentioned that she has another basket of crispy fries just in case he wanted more.  I was impressed with her attitude about the crispy fries.  One would think they would sigh or roll their eyes or give some sort of bothered attitude, but not for Leticia.  She was happy to make sure that we had our food the way we wanted it.

Here at Red Robin, a plain vanilla burger is $9, and if you want toppings, it will run $10+.  It does not have a lunch menu (which Island's has) so there's no price break there for lunch.  So you begin to ask whether this burger that you are gobbling on is worth the money. The ambience here is nice but really nothing fancy.  It's a cool place but without a ""wow"" factor.  Service is adequate but not exceptional.  We came here during lunch hour and they seemed to be overwhelmed and understaffed.  Many empty tables were not cleared quickly enough so there's a short wait for a table. The burgers were good.  The Red Robin burger was tasty and was served with a tangy dressing which was yummy.  The mushroom burger was topped with a very generous serving of mushrooms (see picture).   The burgers were warm, not hot, so they have been sitting in the kitchen for a while.  However, the fries were hot and fresh from the fryer. One thing that Red Robin beats Island's hand down is that here they ask you ""pink or no pink"" so I won't forget to order my burger well done.  At Island's, burgers are served medium unless you specified, and there had been times I forgot to tell them I want it well done.

I saw her at the bar chatting with the bartender.  Eventually she came back and asked if everything was ok, so I told her we'd skip dessert and handed her my card. The next time was a Friday night, my beer was delivered in what seemed to be a glass fresh from the dishwasher...hot glass = warm beer. Not the server's fault, but she came back later to tell me now the keg was being changed. ...And then later to tell me it looks like the job is finally done. Still waiting... Meanwhile we had run out of chips for our spinach dip and looked around for a while with no help in sight.  So we usedd the celery to finsh the dip and still no drinkss.

The individual who seated us, took our drink order and advised that a server would be by shortly.  A few minutes later, 2 of the 4 drinks ordered arrived.  This is where a 2 star review started (salvaged to a 5 star) during the process. We waited for about 20 minutes and still no server stopped by.  Sure, they passed us up as they waited on all of the tables next to us, but not even a hello, had you been waited on, etc.  Our menus were open and it was obvious we had not ordered yet. I went to the front desk, explained that we were sitting for 20 minutes, only 2 of the 4 drinks arrived and I POLITELY asked for a server.  I wish I can remember the manager's name (Rob maybe) but he got this eating experience back on track and to 5 stars, simply for the way the situation was handled. First major kudos to Patricia, who stepped up, apologized about the service and explained that she will take care of us.  By the way, she was not assigned to our area.  She was fantastic.  Corrected our drink orders, talk our food order, made sure everything was correct when it arrived and continued to check in throughout the meal.  Also, the manager, came back a few times to further apologize and also brought out a few apps to munch on while our order was prepared.   Not sure where the breakdown occurred, I think we were right in the middle of the floor in no man's land.  I have a great idea who should have served us, since she helped every table surrounding us, but I will reserve stating her name. In fact, this person brought out our meal, was very unfriendly which is likely because the manager wanted to know what went wrong and she took it out on us.  HOWEVER, that does not matter given how excellent the service was from Patricia who stepped up and took care of business.   It is team members like Patricia that bring people into restaurants.  She really cared about what happened and made things right.  I did not raise a stink, or get upset, or even ask for a discount or free food.  The manager and Patricia knew what to do to remedy the situation and just took care of business. So, from 2 stars to 5, based on service.  I ordered the whisky river BBQ burger which I have had the last 4 or 5 times I have been in and the food has been great and consistent each time.  The whole family enjoyed the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-foothill-ranch?start=160,3.36,3.36,3.36,2.836,3.3600000000000003

69,Michael T.,"Foothill Ranch, CA",347,216,566.0,2.0,2014-07-02,"Unfortunately, as many other reviewers have pointed out, this location has serious, systemic problems with service, even when it's not busy.  You might get lucky and get good service, but that's unlikely. I'm starting to think it's a management and/or training issue, because we've had several different servers, none of which seem to be interested in their work.  We live nearby and used to frequent this place, because when everything is done right, it can be an excellent place for kids and adults.  However, after several issues with different servers, we stopped going there.  Note that we are always extremely polite to servers, in part because we have kids and also because we've been in the service industry and know what it's like. A few months after our last failed attempt to have a good experience at this location, the six of us decided to try it again tonight... and unfortunately our decision to stop going to this restaurant was confirmed yet again.  When we arrived, the restaurant was less than half full (we counted about 10-11 groups and four to five servers).  Despite this, we waited for more than 10 minutes to be seated.  Once we were seated we ordered right away... because my spidey senses were tingling after waiting so long to be seated in a more or less empty restaurant. Despite ordering immediately, nothing happened for 10 minutes.  No drinks, no fries, nothing.  We were straight cold ignored. If you've ever been to Red Robin you know that one of the best parts about eating there is the bottomless basket of fries that you get after you order.  The timing of the fries, and whether you get them at all, of course depends on your server.   You can probably guess what happens next..  after we ordered, no fries. After about 10 minutes, we got... one small basket of fries for six hungry people. It lasted about 30 seconds.  In the meantime, other smaller groups seemed to get multiple baskets. Five minutes after that, we got drinks.  Those also lasted a just a minute or two.  No refills on fries or drinks for 10 minutes... since the server seemed stressed out about working two tables. In any case, the food finally came, and it was decent enough, although we waited about 25-30 minutes for it.  But the server forgot the appetizer we ordered.  No big deal, I understand it happens... plus they brought out a few onion rings on the house (thus saving this from being a one star review). Needless to say, we probably will not be back again, for at least several more months.  It's too bad, because we really like the food they serve.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-foothill-ranch?start=80,3.12,3.12,3.12,2.2800000000000002,3.1200000000000006

The only complaint I have is there is a sign at the entrance to the bar that says Adults only over 21, and I was asked if all parts of my party were over 21 before we were seated there... however right on the other side of the bar area was a child that screamed the entire hour plus we were in the restaurant.  It was really frustrating.  I realize a screaming child isnt the responsibility of the restaurant, but seating placement, is.  Also the last 15 minutes or so of our dinner tonight there were a few teenagers sitting at a table in the bar, with to go cups waiting for their table, and they were definitely not 21.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-foothill-ranch?start=80,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.48,3.2000000000000006
136,Alicia M.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",1,22,5.0,3.0,2014-07-17,"My boyfriend, his three children, and myself were hungry and decided to head on over to Red Robin for dinner.  When we got there, there weren't very many people in the restaurant, and I did see a lot of servers, and the bartender cleaning tables. We didn't get greeted at all. Instead, we waited around the lobby area waiting for a waiter/waitress to seat us. I thought that it was really strange that they wouldn't serve us right away, as it wasn't busy with about four parties in the restaurant. The employees there seemed to be meticulously cleaning as though they were about to close even though it was only 8:15pm.  About three minutes later, a busboy shows up and takes us to a table. He didn't greet us, he just placed some menus on a couple of tables and walked away without informing us when our actual server would be available.  Once he left, we realized that he didn't even leave us enough seating for our entire family. We ended up taking the empty table next to us and fit it to accommodate my boyfriend's teenage son.  And then we waited... and waited... and waited... and waited. No one ever showed up to take our drink order. No one ever showed up to hand us silverware. No one ever showed up to at least tell us their name. Instead, all we saw were a bunch of employees cleaning tables, and cleaning counters.  After about ten minutes of that bull, we decided we had it and just walked out of the restaurant. We didn't even get a server to ask us why we were leaving, we looked straight at them and they'd adjust their eyes somewhere else. It was really irritating as a willingly paying customer to not get any customer service from a restaurant that is supposedly supposed to be there for the customer.  Instead, we headed over to the local Island's and the service was amazing. As soon as we walked into the door, we were greeted and someone sat us right away. They handed us silverware, told us their name, took our drink order, and gave us time to take our order.  We told our waiter, Justin, about our terrible experience at this Red Robin, and he told me that we weren't even the first group of people to even complain about this today. We weren't really surprised when we heard this, but it made us feel validated hearing it.  Red Robin offers a lot of different options, and is generally a very family friendly place. This particular Red Robin though didn't even us let us have that experience because there were no servers available. What a complete and utter disappointment, if you're reading this Yelp review right now, just do yourself the favor and go somewhere else. Edit: 7/18/14 @12:09pm Just had the general manager call me about my experience, and I just had to change my review for him. He was VERY apologetic, making no excuses for his team's behavior and promised to make it better the next time we come to visit. I don't know if I'll be venturing there anytime soon, but I really appreciated the GM's quick response in handling the situation.  I really appreciate the fact that he took the time to call and talk to me about what had happened. Not a lot of companies would go out of their way for their customer like that, but this time around, even though I'm still disappointed, I'm really grateful that the man did everything he did to make me happy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-foothill-ranch?start=120,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.412,3.1600000000000006

The Colossus was not what I expected probably should have ordered this particular Burger well done instead of medium. Burger was soggy and should be expected seeing it had BB Q sauce on it. In the photo it shows Brisket, When I received my burger there was Brisket but was nothing like the photo as expected. Next time I will stick to the Blue Ribbon. Service was outstanding. The server was awesome. Think her name was Patricia. I with the service that I received today I will definitely go back as I use to do on our Friday lunches.

175,Amy H.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,84,,4.0,2014-08-23,"My husband and I visited on a Thursday during lunch hour rush. We were seated right away, we waited a while and our waiter never came. We were thinking of leaving soon because we sat so long without being helped. Soon after we thought this our waiter comes rushing over, apologies right away, gets our drink and appetizer order and rushes off. My husband had noticed him before rushing around non stop.  He comes back with our drinks and appetizers, he bends down and asks if we are ready to order. It was very noisy and Todd, our waiter's name, was very tall. He knelt down so we could hear each other. He got our order and rushed off.  While we were waiting for our food we over heard a female waitress with a short bob giving some customers some attitude. A table next to us asked if they were real onions or something about the onions, and she gives them attitude and says, ""Well this is a REAL burger place so EVERYTHING is real."" Very snotty. Our food comes and everything was made to order and delicious. After he dropped off our food he brought us both new drinks(we didn't even have to ask!), he had also brought us new silverware after we ate our appetizer. When finished he brings us to go boxes and our bill. We thought we had to pay up from so we walked up there because he was so busy. I asked a shorter, chubby waitress and she said our waiter had to take it, but not too nicely. Todd was already there so he took our bill to cash us out. My husband handed him his tip and when he noticed it was a generous tip he became even more thankful than he already was, he was so incredibly pilot the ENTIRE time we were there!  Todd was constantly on the go, he was on top of everything, we didn't need to ask for anything, he did the extra work himself to make sure the customers were happy and enjoying their lunch.

The gal who was cleaning the tables saw i was not happy with my meal and actually assisted me instead. I switched my meal to a regular burger instead, but it too wasn't great. The patty itself had no seasoning and it tasted like i was eating dirt. The only thing it gave this burger some flavor was all the cheese it came with.

217,Jane S.,"Irvine, CA",0,5,,1.0,2015-01-30,"This review has to do with their customer service, rather than their food. A couple months ago, I chose to celebrate my actual birthday with my husband at Red Robin. I had signed up that morning for the Royalty card which was promptly confirmed on my phone via email. This gives you a free burger on the day of the your birthday - a nice gesture for loyal customers, I thought.  Upon arrival we were seated by our server and before I ordered anything, I checked with our server to confirm we would be able to receive the free burger by showing him the email confirmation. We were excited to enjoy a little freebie on my birthday so we order an additional item. After we enjoyed our meal and went to pay the bill, the server then said that because I signed up the day-of, it doesn't take effect for 24 hours, even though I received the email. I had not read any such thing when I signed up and had reminded him that I had checked with him, and he had said we were good. He got his manager who decided to dig in his heels too. So, instead of doing the right thing to make amends for the mistake by the server, the manager chose to make me feel bad (on my birthday) and we paid for the burger. He acted like we were trying to take advantage of them somehow. It's a burger, not a car. Perspective. The point is, out of all the places we could have gone to celebrate a birthday on the actual day, I chose to celebrate with my husband at their establishment. And all I got was bad customer service and left feeling hurt. They didn't honor their word or their Royalty card. Never again. They have lost our patronage. And when I contacted customer service via email, the ""customer service representative"" obviously misread my email and offered an explanation that had nothing to do with what I wrote. When I wrote back to clarify, I never received a response. I'm writing now because it still bothers me and I want others to know what customer service should NOT look like. Hopefully they take this as a coaching tool for their employees and managers.

But mixed seafood bake and pizza, especially pizza, don't bother. My son usually eats anything and isn't too picky but tonight he wouldn't eat his pepperoni pizza. It's quite similar to a cheap frozen pizza from the supermarket.  I had a new crabcake sandwich which was good. The ciabatta bun was great. The dungeneous crab cake was crisply fried on the outside and had okay crab flavor, but a bit too much filling. The veggies and sauce were tasty. Fries were bit undercooked. The ranch dressing is great.  Our waitress was very good. She was friendly and handled our many requests nicely. She brought my wife lots of lettuce leaves upon request to go with her fish sticks. The seafood bake is not great. The seafood has an off-taste. The breading is excessive. None of us got burgers this time, but they are very good and I recommend sticking with them and asking for fries cooked bit extra, and ask for side of ranch. Want more frys? No problem, bottomless.

101,Chelsea M.,"Fullerton, CA",628,573,156.0,5.0,2015-04-05,"Bruschetta Chicken Sandwich is grilled chicken breast topped with fresh bruschetta salsa, pesto aioli, provolone, romaine lettuce, and balsamic cream on rustic ciabatta. The chicken breast is tender and juicy. The provolone is lovingly melted and encases the chicken breast like a blanket. The pesto, bruschetta, and balsamic are bursting with flavors of Italy with a perfect balance of sweet, savory, herbaceous freshness. Rating: 4.5/5 Prime Chophouse Burger is a fire-grilled burger layered with horseradish-sautéed mushrooms, gourmet steak sauce, provolone, country Dijon, and crispy onion straws on an onion bun. Red Robin's burgers are always juicy and meaty. I like to order my burgers at a medium rare temperature to keep it juicy when it gets to the table. The sautéed mushrooms pair well with beef patty. The provolone melts just enough to cover the mushrooms like a cheese dome. I thought that there was too much sauce on this burger. I think if they stick with just the steak sauce, it would be fine. The Dijon is too strong and does not pair well with the rest of the flavors on this burger. I think if they did a pork-inspired burger or sandwich, the Dijon would pair nicely. The crispy onion straws on my burger were also soggy and not crispy. It would have been nice to have a crispy texture on this burger. The onion bun is awesome! It has just the right amount of onion flavor and the texture is soft like it was just out of the oven. Rating: 3.5/5 BLTA Croissant Sandwich is a combination of turkey breast, hardwood-smoked bacon, mayo, lettuce, tomato, and avocado. It reminded me of a time I used to work at Café Orleans in Disneyland. We made a sandwich called the Croissant Mardi Gras and it was a similar blend of flavors. But Red Robin's BLTA is more sophisticated with thicker slices of turkey, smoky bacon, and creamy avocado. It's simple, but very tasty. Our server was awesome to replace the fries with a cup of the Clamdigger's Clam Chowder, making our Café Orleans remake complete. The clam chowder is creamy and has a healthy serving of clams inside. Rating: 5/5 A.1. Peppercorn Burger is topped with hardwood smoke bacon, melted pepper jack, A.1. peppercorn spread, tomatoes, and crispy onion straws. I ordered it with a lettuce wrap so I could use my carb count for the fries. This is a definitely a steakhouse burger! The A.1. peppercorn sauce works well with the burger. It felt like I was in a Carl's Jr. commercial as all of the sauce squirted all over my hands. It's a hot mess, but worth it. Just ask for extra napkins! My onion straws were crispy this time so the crispy onion flavor and texture worked perfectly with the burger. Rating: 5/5 Chili Chili Cheeseburger is served open-face topped with Red's Chili Chili, cheddar cheese, chipotle aioli, and diced red onions. This is definitely a knife and fork burger. The chili is a little thin. I think if it were a little thicker, it would cling better to the burger. The chili itself has a really rich, kettle cooked flavor. A good point is that you can rescue the escaping chili with the fries to make your own make-shift chili cheese fries.

121,Dale A.,"Camarillo, CA",0,14,,2.0,2015-08-16,"We went to Red Robin for lunch just before noon yesterday.  My wife and I were visiting our daughter and her family in Portola Hills, and went to Red Robin because they are kid-friendly. It was a Saturday, and there were 4 adults and 3 children in our party.  Everything was fine through the point that we placed our order.  It took quite a while to receive our order, but we were looking forward to a nice meal.  My wife and I did not have a lot of time to spend, so we just wanted to have our lunch and then be on our way. Problem one:  Grandson's order was completely wrong, and had to be re-made.  So much for a quick lunch. Problem two:  I ordered one of the pricey hamburgers, and specified ""well done.""  What I received was a sandwich that was only a half-step above raw hamburger.  Really, what I got might have been a health hazard.  By this time, we did not have time to wait for a re-do.  The waiter did take this item off the check, but no lunch for me. Problem 3:  The service staff was totally overwhelmed.  They were working very hard, but could not keep up. Problem 4:  My daughter asked for more water for her three kids.  Kids are given mini-water glasses which run out quickly.  One of the service people finally filled my daughter's glass and quickly ran off, but did not fill the children's glasses. The last issue was really funny to us, considering the rest of the meal.  I finally received the bill.  I pressed the button on the supplied ball point pen so that I could add the tip, and the ink cartridge shot out of the pen and ended up in the middle of the aisle!  I finished the tip with my own pen.  Yes, I did give a tip because the servers were working very hard, but I wish that I could have given a negative tip for the kitchen and management. My suggestion is to avoid this restaurant whenever it is likely to be busy.  Also, plan enough time so that your raw hamburger can be re-made.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-foothill-ranch?start=120,2.72,3.09,3.09,2.152,2.9419999999999997

If anyone knows this place its that its loud around dinner time with all the kids (I felt awful having to ask her to repeat everything she was saying). Second time was a late lunch so they weren't as busy, I came with my mother in law who has a thick accent and the server seemed so frustrated every time she asked her a question that she couldn't understand (I would then tell the server what she asked so she could respond) but you could tell our server was thoroughly irritated by all the questions (not our fault if we don't know the menu and have questions).  Third time we got food delivered and it was actually good as we didn't have to deal with the restaurant experience. Fourth time was yet another disappointment, my friend and I ordered the same burgers - mine well done, hers was supposed to be pretty damn pink and what do you know it wasn't even though when they brought the burgers out they specified which was well done and which wasn't.

We then ordered our food, and asked for a basket of fries which came out cold and under cooked they said they would bring us out more but never did. About 40 minutes go by and our food still hasn't came out. We looked around the restaurant and there wasn't very many people inside. We called our waitress over and said ""what's up? We've been waiting an hour"" she replied ""the kitchen lost your ticket. Would you like to speak to our manager?"" My dad said, ""yes please"" Finally an hour later my plate comes and again, the fries are soggy. I politely asked if I could have some need fries our waitress of course said yes and brought them back. During this time my parents and my little brothers meals still have not arrived. 10 minutes later the rest of the food arrives but my little brothers burger is wrong and my dad's burger has pink in it when he asked for no pink. Another 10 minutes go by and the manager brings the rest of the food, and my brothers burger was still incorrect. He apologized multiple times and took off our entire meal.

Prices have gone up and portion sizes have gone DOWN. The value seems to be diminished. You have to remember, this is a restaurant that makes burgers and fries. This is cheap food that should not cost so much. A family of 4 will spend a minimum of $50-$60 for not much food and it will make you feel silly for spending all that money for burgers and fries.

29,Carlene P.,"Lake Forest, CA",39,238,187.0,5.0,2016-07-24,"I hadn't been to a Red Robin for several years when I went with my family for lunch yesterday before a movie at the Regal cinema in the immediate area.  The menu has improved significantly since I've been away.  Expecting very limited options for my picky diet, I was delighted to find the offerings very flexible for different tastes and to allow for the adherence to various diets.  For example, they now have a Garden Burger and you can request this option with any of their burgers.  If you prefer a vegan diet, they also have a Boca Burger with which you can do the same with.  This is really big for vegetarians and vegans!  I was feeling like a salad and asked the waiter if I could exchange avocado for the chicken that comes on the Bansai Chicken salad and he couldn't have been more accommodating about the request.  He seemed delighted to be able to do that for me.  And, Red Robin has individually  priced these ingredients so that it actually cost me less to have this exchange (price of chicken, which I think was $2 was deducted and cost of avocado, $1.39 added).  Virtually no place else does this!  I love it!   My son had a Boca burger, and mom and hubby both chose the fish and chips, which came with four generous pieces of perfectly cooked cod.  Red Robin also offers various sides, so even though this dish has ""chips"" right in the name, mom was able to select a green salad instead.  The fries are steak fries and bottomless, so if you love great fries, this is the place to come.  Check the last page of the menu for healthier options, if that is of interest to you. Being that this was a Saturday afternoon, there were a lot of families dining so it was a bit noisy and it seemed to be taking a while to get the kid-trashed tables cleaned up after the parties had left, but we did get there at the end of their lunch rush, so this may not be typical. Very friendly service by our waiter, Nick, who stayed on top of drink refills and checked back several times to see if we needed anything.   And when you're ready to pay, no waiting for the bill - there is a device right at your table that will display your bill and permit you to pay electronically.  For cash payment, you'll need to enlist the assistance of your wait person.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-foothill-ranch?start=20,2.88,2.76,2.76,2.7399999999999998,2.808

Their protocol is unacceptable. Why do I have to sit in someone else's filth because I had a toddler with me.  It literally takes 2 minutes to sweep up another persons mess!

33,Ken H.,"Lake Forest, CA",9,43,,4.0,2017-02-24,"We've stopped by Red Robin since we lived in Seattle, where the chain was founded. Their hamburgers have always been excellent, kind of expensive but worth it. This visit we found little computer thingies on the tables. You could place your orders from these, play some games (extra $), and pay the bill. Obviously Red Robin is looking to reduce staff. I found the computer ordering process ungainly and not very intuitive, so we ordered from our server the usual way. That worked fine. A change: The milkshakes and malts, which used to come only in one size, now can be had two ways. The first or ""classic"" is a single fluted glass filled with the drink, whipped cream on top. The second or ""monster"" is the way they were always served before, the same fluted glass but a lot more in the metal container right from the milkshake mixer. Only a dollar more but too much for me; I had a classic malt. It was good, as usual, and enough. For burgers, I had a Gourmet Cheeseburger, an old standby and as good as ever. I wish they still wrapped them in paper, though, because otherwise they tend to disintegrate about two-thirds of the way through. My wife had the ""keep it simple"" burger, which she said was quite good. She also had a margarita which she gave excellent marks. The fries, included, were cut flat and a bit thin, somewhat chewy and not entirely to my taste. I think this is a change. My wife paid the bill using the computer thingy and that part was simple and went well. We got there about 11:30 and parking was close and easy. We were seated immediately and the service was fine. The food hasn't changed much, and that's fine also. Four stars, dinged a bit for the flaky computer ordering system and a couple of changes in the way things are prepared and served that I'm not so enthusiastic about.

I was greeted and seated promptly and the waiter took my drink order and asked if I would like an appetizer. Great service. Unfortunately the food just didn't seem to match the service. The menu is amazing. They offer tons of choices and I think anyone could find something they wanted on that menu. They accommodate all diet types, gluten free, vegetarian, low fat, etc, and you can even customize your burger to a chicken or veggie option as well as the sides. Plus, they give you the nutritional break down on everything which is helpful to me. However, my meal just wasn't what I remembered from the past. I remember juicy, flavorful food and great fries.  I ordered the fiery chicken sandwhich and made a bun substitution to save calories. The sandwhich was described to have jalapeño coins (deep fried jalapeños which sound amazing!) a sauce, pepper jack cheese, lettuce, and tomato and of course, grilled chicken. The chicken was really rubbery and just lacked flavor. The much anticipated jalapeño coins were kind of disappointing, just seemed a little bland and not really spicy at all. I ate the entire sandwhich, and it was not bad by any means, but I just couldn't get excited about it. The fries were also just very mediocre.  Again not awful, but I couldn't get excited about them.  So I think I will try it again and maybe order a real burger and see how it goes.

Everything was made so quickly and I felt bad because it was almost closing time and they had people coming in to eat, and dealing with us! When he brought out our food he even gave us extra fries in our bag for the wait. (Was no wait, really! But it was incredibly kind!) THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO HELPED US!!

3,Timmy S.,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",503,1624,2998.0,4.0,2017-07-31,"I've been a fan of Red Robin for years, having been a customer back when they only had one restaurant near the University of Washington. I've been to many locations since then as they've expanded. Right when I was thinking Red Robin was becoming a tired relic I visited this location and was pleasantly surprised. It's like Red Robin sat on a tack and upped their game - this is definitely the best location I've been to. The menu has been revamped and the decor, while leaving much the same for the sake of nostalgia, has been modernized here and there. And an emphasis has been put on service which was exceptional. The customer uses a touchscreen on the table to rate their server at the end of the meal if they so desire; this feedback keeps them accountable as too many low scores can lead to termination. Despite a variety of new menu items I went with my reliable standby - Banzai Burger with fries and a chocolate milkshake.  Red Robin has always made an outstanding shake and I'm glad to report they still do. Thick and deliciously chocolatey it's one of the best out there. The burger was properly cooked to order (medium) and had great juicy flavor. The bun was fresh and soft plus it was the perfect size. The bottomless fries were great; the first bunch delivered were somewhat sparse but my server was quick to have them refilled. And he was right on the money in recommending their ""campfire"" dipping sauce for the fries. I loved it. It reminded me of Chick-fil-A sauce but with more of a smokey taste. Red Robin, what happened? Glad to see the improvements! Hope the other locations are doing as incredible a job as this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-foothill-ranch,3.68,2.91,2.91,,3.218

The thrill is gone, sad to say.  I come here for the fish and chips, and in the past I have been pretty happy overall.  Tonight's meal was a mixed blessing: four small pieces of nicely battered cod in a sea of dry, lukewarm, uneven- sized French fries.  What has happened to RR's fries?!?  My order was obviously frozen--not ""fresh"" as boasted--and stiff as little surfboards.  Who would like ""endless"" quantities of these stale potatoes?   Next time I want a gourmet burger and hand-cut fries, I'll go to Burger Boss.  I can do without Red Robin's roomy booth when I'm looking for really tasty food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-foothill-ranch,3.44,2.97,2.97,,3.1580000000000004

I asked for some pink and one half of the patty was black and I couldn't even eat it. I understand they have to cook kids burgers well, but black? C'mon management where is the quality control? When we complained to the server the manager didn't even come over to the table, it was obvious he had no control over what was happening on the floor w- servers or in the kitchen.  Don't go here, find something better.. and BTW a $13 burger is pretty easy to find elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-foothill-ranch?start=20,3.28,2.96,2.96,,3.088
