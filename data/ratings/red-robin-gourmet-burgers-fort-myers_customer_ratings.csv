The burgers are great and enormous. I had a bacon double cheese burger and I won't be eating again today. Everyone was friendly and the food came out quick and hot.

64,Mark V.,"Elkridge, MD",4,9,,3.0,2013-05-07,"I've been a Red Robin fan since my days of living in Arizona. This was only the second time I've been to one since being in Florida. This time, eh. We went in for a lunch. Place wasn't busy, we were greeted quickly and took our seats outside. Our waitress came over, took our drink orders. Upon giving her our orders, she went and got them. She came back, gave my drink to my and my drink to her. No biggie. I ordered a Freckled Lemonade and was kinda dissappointed that not only did I get it in a weird glass, but it was mostly strawberries. Just a regular glass would be ok, not some S shaped one. But whatever, it was still amazing and free refills. I unrolled my silverware and to my shock, saw a piece of lettuce still on my knife. Looked caked on. So probably ""washed"" and left on. Gross. Thankfully, I didn't need my knife. Still really gross. The meal was great. Food was really good and everything was tasty. During it, my girl needed a refill. The waitress picked up the glass with ONE FINGER INSIDE THE GLASS and one outside. Uh, gross much? We figured we'd be getting a new glass and straw. But not knowing, since we didn't follow her, left us looking at each other with a puzzled look as to whether we did or not. So we don't know. I tweeted Red Robin about the lettuce/knife. They followed up with me in a call. They apologized and are sending me a gift card. So we'll see how my visit goes, I don't want to give up on the company, maybe it's just this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fort-myers?start=60,2.54,2.54,2.54,2.54,2.54

Regardless, this place is ok. The meat is always fresh and the options are great. BUT they hire first-time servers, which is totally ok, it just means you might not get the best service. Sometimes it's really great service, but mostly really slow and you'll end up doing most of the work yourself.  The décor is really busy, but it's supposedly great for the kids. My two year old gives us a much harder time here, though, compared to other places which is really weird.

However, we had absolutely no complaints about our service at Red Robin. We sat at the bar on a Saturday night and a man named Antimo treated us like valued customers and really showed us some hustle and fun. Even though we were there at a time where there were no Happy Hour drink specials, the value and taste of our experience was very good and we also appreciated how Red Robin does NOT allow any children in the bar area based on posted signage. More restaurants with designated bar areas should also adopt this rule and give adults a place to quietly enjoy a drink and meal without being exposed to loud and undisciplined kids.

62,Gregg S.,"Fort Myers, FL",0,8,,3.0,2014-01-29,"Red Robin meals, particularly hamburgers and fries, are always delicious! BEWARE however, at this restaurant they do not filter the water to the root beer and I suspect other carbonated drinks.  The chlorine taste knocked me over!  I could not drink it. My wife had iced tea which according to the waitress was filtered and it was fortunately drinkable. This is inexcusable for a national chain not to filter chlorine from their water supply. I have eaten in other Red Robin's in large cities and have never experienced a problem like this. So bottom line - drink tea or beer!  Food was great!

17,Justin S.,"Fort Myers, FL",3,2,1.0,2.0,2014-02-16,"My fiancé and I decided to end our shopping excursion with what we thought would be a delightful dining experience...in the end, we left disappointed, here's why: We arrived for a late lunch (330pm) and stood for a moment before being greeted by one of the two hosts that we're chatting amongst themselves with their backs to the doors. No big deal, they were polite! We were informed that there would be a twenty minute wait (I cringed as we planned to see a movie at 505) but was told we could be seated right away anyway.  FYI don't let them seat you at the high tops in the bar. The seats are terribly uncomfortable and will not allow you to relax even the slightest bit--though maybe that's the point! We waited an unacceptable amount of time to get our drink order delivered completely. And when the table to our left, who was seated 15min after, had already gotten drinks AND put in their order....I left my table to go ask that a manager visit us. Two managers ended up assisting us. The GM both took and delivered our order. He tried to please, but overall nobody seemed to have any desire, let alone passion, to create an enjoyable dining experience. Then came the food. Let me just say that had the entire deck not had been stacked against the burger we ordered, it alone would have saved this experience. The royal red robin; it's the burger topped with bacon AND egg. They call it the royal, I'm imagining, because it's the king of burgers! It was cooked to perfection, the tomatoes were crisp and flavorful, and the presentation was awesome. I must say, I was scared that this burger has atop of it an over easy egg. The idea of the yolk bursting and running everywhere (don't like this) really creeped me out. BUT, I shrugged it off and WOW. It was amazing! So, we are hoping that they were just having a bad day. The food alone deserves to be rated higher, but the many service barriers weighed it down. We will give it a shot again soon and hope to feel as royal as our burger tasted!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fort-myers?start=20,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003,2.3120000000000003

Well, he did say if I did not like it he would bring me just the patties with all the trimmings and there would be no charge to fix the burger the way I wanted it.

7,Erin J.,"Tampa, FL",9,177,18.0,2.0,2014-11-15,You have to wonder if job requirements to be a waitress/waiter at Red Robin requires you to give poor service and not follow directions. I wonder if the kitchen staff are required to also seemingly cook at sloth speed.  This seems to be a chain wide phenomenon and yet apparently people love this place.

56,Welter A.,"Lehigh Acres, FL",4,25,9.0,2.0,2014-12-19,"Sorry to say that the only Red Robin within 2 hours of me is less than mediocre. Every RR I've been to has been decent or good, this one has been a nightmare twice (0 for 2 here). Went here for my birthday burger (sign up for their rewards, their program is good, but apparently need to go to another store for decent food, read on).  This last time was so dreadful. Service and kitchen were REALLY SLOW (took 20 minutes for apps to come out, half hour for meal AFTER we finished the app), but diner was about at medium capacity. My wife was sitting without any sweetener for her tea for about 20 minutes until the forgetful but nice waitress finally got them (sweeteners were requested from near the beginning). The Jalapeño coins used to be the best anywhere and sometimes I would tell my wife she was on her own because I would get a double order just for myself. I normally never do that anywhere. Now, I think they changed manufacturer and the jalapeños taste pickled, which make them taste super salty. The manager tried to tell me it's because they prepared it with the fries so maybe some salt stuck to it. I call BS because that is how all the other places' coins taste like - they probably caved and are now receiving their shipment from the lowest bidder like everyone else (try Square 1 burgers' jalapeños and tell me they aren't the same?). The portions for the coins were utterly disappointing, but I'm glad it wasn't more, because they sucked - I didn't even finish the tiny bit that I had. This used to be one of my favorite appetizers in any restaurant ever and now... Sigh. My wife's wrap felt like hard duct tape. If the zombie apocalypse ever happened, just wrap yourself with this Red Robin's wrap and you'll be bite proof - no way they can chew through that.  Some of my fries were undercooked and I felt like I had to go through a minefield with trying to find out which one was cooked and which one wasn't. It was gross and I should have stopped, but I'm fat. Since I was still hungry and disappointed, I ordered more fries and asked the waitress to make sure they were cooked well. The burger was ok, it was the only redeeming quality even if the bun was super soggy. The diet soda tasted terrible so I exchanged it for the only other good thing which was the tea (if you manage to get sweeteners with it). With all that mediocrity going around, at least the manager came around and talked to us and gave us a 50% discount which was really nice of him. We used the 50% discount and my birthday burger so it came out pretty cheap. But too expensive for the horrible experience we had. We really hate to ask to be comped, so we left it as is, we think it was a lot more than other managers do. To be honest, I had to hold back from giving it 1 stars because I know that I am extra disappointed that the only RR near me is this bad when I used to live 20 minutes from one that was a PLEASURE to go to. The manager said he was going to check on our fries and walked away. Waitress brought us the check, and told us she was going to check on our fries that we asked for 20 minutes ago. We waited patiently for another 10 minutes sitting at the table with our dipping sauces at the ready and the check paid for. But we just decided to leave. Since we originally ordered the fries it was a whole half hour. Half hour for a refill! We just left without receiving our 1st refill of ""bottomless fries"". This Red Robin has been such a disappointment that I wish it were called something else so as not to tarnish the name of such a great franchise. I really hope for new management soon and I hope corporate steps in to train them, because this place really needs the immediate help.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fort-myers?start=40,2.96,2.96,2.96,2.3440000000000003,2.96

She said we could have more...how generous.....we said yes and only got them after our meal was finished.  She apologized and said that there was only 1 cook and he was new and he may of been distracted.  Perhaps managers should walk around more and check to see if customers are happy, don't think server cared one way or the other.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fort-myers?start=60,2.8,2.8,2.8,2.212,2.8

The hostess...she took 5 minutes to get to hostess stand when we came in, she seemed drunk or very high & slow, she made a smart ass remark but then laughed at herself, and mumbled.  Waitress...she seemed very new and did not know happy hour menu, she did not come by to check on us after food arrived, and kept calling us sweetheart, babe, or baby.  Food...horrible!  A bit warmer than room temperature chicken for the grilled chicken on a stick. ""Fruit salad"" was red pineapples (ew) and apple bits. Bbq chicken salad was nothing like menu stated...except that it had chicken and lettuce, but it had items missing and items added. It was not worth almost $11. It was missing the dressing stated on menu and after I saw waitress pass several times looking away from our table, my mom finally got her attention for dressing. She asked what kind I wanted and I told her that I wanted what the menu stated and she came back with ranch. At the bottom of the small $11 serving, I saw a bunch of shredded carrots which I avoid and weren't supposed to be in the salad. I had given my son one piece of chicken, cut up, for him to eat. The rest I left next to me and when I went for another piece for him, I noticed about 3 flies on the food. These same flies kept going after everyone's food and we kept swatting them away.  My mom and daughter both enjoyed their food and everything came out for them how they wanted.  The waitress finally checked on us when we were ready to pay and leave. When asked if we needed a box, I was able to tell the waitress that my son's food had flies on it, so we didn't want the baby eating it. She apologized and offered a replacement meal.  Someone (the manager??) came over and knelt down next to me to ask me, ""What happened? Why does he need a replacement meal?""...me, ""Um, there were flies on my son's food."" Him, ""Yeah, we can't keep them out of the place. They're making another meal for him right now."" Then he go up and walked away. I'm guessing that was the manager who did not want us to know his name because he came back while I went to the bathroom (that's a whole other bad review right there) and gave my mom a $10 gift card.

27,Amy E.,"Fort Myers, FL",18,379,282.0,3.0,2016-11-22,"First time ever in a Red Robin, and I chose the Gulf Coast Town Center location. I can't down rate this place on the first try, but I also can't give it the ""I'm a fan!!"" star treatment either. As a whole, I found everything to be just right; ""A-Ok"".  That being said, I know a lot of people rave about Red Robin, and I honestly have trouble understanding why.  Sure, there's the ""bottomless fries"" offer, but they're steak fries you can buy at the supermarket (or make your own). Yes, the burger I had (Smoky Jack Tavern Double) was good. No complaints about how it was cooked (medium and still dripping from the grille). Although, it was a little messy in the beginning due to the barbecue sauce. As a whole, I found it lacked a ""smoky"" flavor (why are they calling it ""Smoky Jack"" - is it the ""Smoky Campfire Sauce"", the ""bourbon-infused Whiskey River BBQ sauce"" or ""melted Pepper-Jack cheese"" that gives it the flavor? I couldn't tell. However, the BBQ sauce was a little sweet - that was nice kick). For $6.99, I guess I got what I paid for - two small patties on a sesame seed bun, lettuce, tomato, pickles and onion with Jack cheese and BBQ sauce. Plus hot / fresh steak fries. The burger was quite interesting, given the circumstance. Restaurant as a whole: I feel like the place can't decide if it wants to be fast food on a ""trying to be modernistic and fun restaurant"" budget, or on the next level up restaurant that wants to pretend it sells $10 burgers for the hipster sports crowd. Either way, once I got to look around, I know I've seen the kitschy wall art before... same kind of ""off the wall"" / random decor that most sports bars / funky one-off chain restaurants try to emulate. They want you to have fun eye candy while you wait for your meals.  With the added 12"" iPad (?) standing on each table, Red Robin has become one of the places to bounce its' clients into the 21st century by actually paying on the tablet. There was an Apple Pay type of Square attached to the machine, so you could swipe via gift card, credit card, phone (I think I saw) or have a ""buzz for server"" option to come collect your monies. The downside to this touch screen / pay it yourself program is the fact you do have to wait for a server to collect cash from you. If you don't want to pay by plastic (they assume you will... even our server said ""pay when you're ready on the machine""), it's hard to look at an actual paper receipt and want to put down paper money. You do get a small receipt that's spit out on the bottom of the tablet, so you have proof you paid and what your rewards points are up to. The whole deal comes down to being tabulated on the front end Point Of Sale system and streams magically to your table to this individual POS table top computer. One down side to this, is no free wifi. If you have these tabletop POS computers, offer clients wifi because when you add the Red Robin Rewards system to the checkout, you're expected to do things on your smartphone (like sign up for the rewards on the tablet and then activate everything on your phone, as the rewards number you get isn't yours until you create an account). The plus side to this, is the waitress said if we got on our smartphone right then and there, activated the rewards card, we got a free piece of cake.  All in all, our waitress was nice, and she checked on us when she could. However, she had a lot of tables to wait on in the process of attempting to expedite orders. For two people ordering the $6.99 Tavern burger deal, we walked out almost two hours later, having had an additional order of fries (you honestly only get a solid handful with the burger) and the free cake for signing up.  Will I go back? I don't know. Maybe I'll try another Red Robin somewhere else to compare today's lunch to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fort-myers,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88
38,Daniel S.,"Fort Myers, FL",62,10,1.0,2.0,2017-01-23,"The customer service is friendly, but there is one thing I just can't stand about this location.... Every time I ordered bottomless fries the waitress conveniently stays away from the table.  They come to the table twice every time- once for the order and the second time to drop off food- this is also when they tell you how to checkout on table/computer. If they upsell a product that is supposedly unlimited refills why should the customer have to bend over backwards to get them. Just knowing they ordered bottomless they should automatically make an effort to visit the table. Now just the other day was my first time getting the prime rib sandwich- the waitress explained it was a hot sandwich- the place was empty and our order took about 20 mins to come out.. When it did my meat was cold to the touch. I was so hungry I just ate as much as I could bear and survived off my fries. The au ju that it came with was even cold- but surprisingly the sandwich was colder. It looks cooked on the plate but touching and eating it, its was cold. Complete disappointment. Another issue I have with the location is the rewards program on the touchscreen device- it is hit or miss each time. Sometimes it recognizes my phone number and then other days it doesn't.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fort-myers,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84
24,Carol E.,"Naples, FL",93,61,33.0,2.0,2017-04-03,"Stopped at the Gulf Center Drive location on Sunday, April 2nd around 1:30 pm. This was my first and last time at Red Robin. In the world of great burgers, there is a lot of competition out there and Red Robin fell very short of my moderate expectations. First of all, the buns were very dry. Any burger connoisseur will tell you a really good bun is a very critical element to a great burger. The ideal soft burger bun should be pillowy and tender, with a tight but soft crumb. It should hold up nicely to the burger's juices, but should never be tough or cottony. On the opposite end of the spectrum, you don't want a burger that disintegrates after the first bite. The Red Robin burgers we ordered were dry and very crumbly. I'm not sure if they were stale or simply of poor quality. Next: the overall cleanliness. My booth had crumbs I had to wipe off and the table, having just been wiped down, was still covered in a very thin layer of cleaning solution. The hostess warned us not to set anything on the table and apologized for it still being so wet. I guess no one could be bothered to actually clean AND properly wipe dry the table before allowing guests to be seated. In fact, when our food arrived about 15 minutes later, the table was still wet. A couple french fries toppled on to the table and into the remaining drops of cleaning solution (or water...whatever that was). When the time came to pay the check, the pay-at-the-table pad was so grimy and greasy I honestly didn't want to touch it. This should be wiped down after each turnover! As for the bathrooms: yuck. I try to avoid public restrooms whenever possible but since we were planning on doing more shopping after our lunch I decided to brave it. Dirty stalls, dirty sink, trash overflowing with used paper towels falling from the opening. Completely unacceptable.  The one positive: we had a great waiter. He was efficient, friendly and knowledgeable. Definitely worth a gracious tip. Overall, in an area saturated with some really great burger places, next time I'll be bypassing Red Robin and dining elsewhere. Better yet, I'll grill my own.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fort-myers,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
31,Rocio P.,"Fort Myers, FL",213,10,,3.0,2017-04-06,"The food is alright. I work in the plaza so I've ordered to-go a few times. The last time I picked up food, the server dropped all 3 of the plates that my coworkers and I had ordered. They all landed upside down in their boxed. The girl didn't show any concern. She said ""they're packed well, they're fine"". Thats not what I wanted to hear. Anyway, that was a few weeks ago.  We haven't ordered from them anymore. The food isn't good enough for us to put up with laziness.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fort-myers,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84
21,Doyle H.,"Fort Myers, FL",35,197,5.0,3.0,2017-05-09,"Red Robin is a decent chain burger joint.  I've had the fish and chips before - I can't recommend it.  The burgers are good, and there are plenty of options to go with. The fries are unlimited and usually really good. They're the thick, meaty variety too, and to that point, I will say that I've had one of the nastiest fries I've ever put in my mouth from here. It may have been one of the worst things I've ever tasted. I'm not even sure that this was Red Robin's fault, but this thing was foul. The experience has not been repeated, and I have been back several times. On occasion, the service will lag somewhat, but most of the time, it's pretty good. Drinks are kept full, and so are the bottomless fries.  Craving an out-of-the-ordinary burger and some good fries? Stop in to Red Robin. They even have ordinary burgers, but I suggest trying the Royal (with cheese!). It's the one with the fried egg. You may not need to eat again for another few days, but it's worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fort-myers,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8
30,Bethany O.,"Fort Myers, FL",0,6,,1.0,2017-05-16,This place is awesome with kids. If you come in with no kids the staff is rude. The waitress we had rushed us to eat and leave. Her name was Ashley. She kept going to the hostess station asking to not be sat because she NEEDED a smoke break. That is not okay. The food was amazing we love Red Robin but you need to hire friendlier and enthusiastic  people.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fort-myers,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8
22,John M.,"Chicago, IL",2,126,16.0,2.0,2017-10-04,I am going to have to pass on this place. A burger and a drink with tip was over twenty two bucks. Just not worth the price.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fort-myers,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72
26,G A.,"Lehigh Acres, FL",93,5,1.0,1.0,2017-10-17,"Horrible service, no one was at the front hostess station when we walked in, waited 5 min before someone showed up, then it took the waitress more than 5 min to come to our table after we were seated and when she did she had resting Bit** face and attitude the whole time. What is wrong with these people? Food was horrible, my bun was cold and I didn't get my sweet potato fries until 15 min later after I asked for them again and my husbands fries were cold when he got his meal. Total disappointment. Won't go back here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fort-myers,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6
20,Donavon K.,"Cape Coral, FL",0,9,3.0,4.0,2017-11-02,"Onion ring tower is a must order. The camp fire sauce that comes with it is a must. I ordered the Red Robin Burger. It was cook right and came out in A reasonable amount of time. I got the garlic fries, which were amazing. As always the fries are bottomless. It is worth noting you have to pay extra for garlic fries. My meal with the onion ring tower was $25.  I was in a party of 7 and no one had complaints. Average price of the meals where around $12-$15. Mine was more due to the onion rings we all shared.  Our waitress was on the spot with drinks and taking our order. As well as friendly to talk to. I give her 5 stars.  Over all rating for the place is a 4 because I was just not wowed enough to give 5. No real complaints.  Tables where clean and the place looked neat and organized.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fort-myers,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6
