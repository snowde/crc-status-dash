22,Jimmie H.,"Burleson, TX",90,472,2926.0,4.0,2013-08-26,Love the gourmet burgers here and the bottomless fries. My favorite is the Royal that comes with bacon and a fried egg followed closely by the Whisky River BBQ burger. They've done a good job of utilizing the space previously occupied by the fountains and the waitstaff is very attentive.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fort-worth?start=40,2.9600000000000004,2.9600000000000004,2.9600000000000004,2.9600000000000004,2.9600000000000004
33,Karen M.,"Fort Worth, TX",20,18,1.0,4.0,2013-09-14,"I'd been to other Red Robin restaurants before but never enjoyed it as much as this visit. The burger I had (Burnin Love) was cooked exactly the way I like it. The chile sauce they put on it has a great kick. It was on the spicier side for those that want to know.  The fries are seasoned well and are bottomless!  I couldn't manage to finish off my first batch though.  Guac and chips weren't delicious. It was missing the lime flavor, but you can't expect much from a hamburger joint.  Service from Clarence was wonderful. My glass was always full. I did feel slightly uncomfortable when i was  greeted by about 6 or 7 people when I first walked in. A little overkill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fort-worth?start=40,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004
45,Louis G.,"Fort Worth, TX",1,18,,4.0,2013-11-14,"Red Robin is one of my wife's favorite places (for burgers) so we were delighted when one opened at the Hulen Mall.  Normally, as an insulin-dependent diabetic, I would order a salad, while my wife chowed down on the fabulous hamburgers and fries.  However, while looking at the menu during our first visit to this new Red Robin, I saw that not only could one choose the type of hamburger bun they wanted (including gluten free, onion, etc), but that they would serve any sandwich in a 'lettuce wrap'.  I thus ordered a cheeseburger in a lettuce wrap. It was wonderful! They made a 'bun' out of thick wedges of iceburg lettuce, with each side of the lettuce bun (top, bottom) being close to half an inch thick (you can easily peal off a layer or two), with the sandwich itself being served wrapped in paper (so you are not holding the lettuce). I immediately declared my intention to lunch at Red Robin every week for the foreseeable future or the rest of my life, whichever occurs first. .  Since I can't eat regular french fries, I substituted the sweet potato fries, which were excellent (I did take some Aprida insulin to cover the carbs from the sweet potatoes, since they are not carb-free by any means). Perhaps the best sweet potato fries I have ever had (I think they used sea salt, which makes a big difference).  My only complaint (hence the 4 versus 5 stars) is on behalf of my wife: proclaiming to serve 'bottomless' fries is worthless if the server does not come by the table to replenish the supply (they initially give you a small serving). When our server finally came by and was asked for more fries, it took a good five minutes for them to get to the table. I was surprised at the delay, since it was 11:30 a.m., with few people in the restaurant. My wife also said that the steak fries were overcooked, although she found a few that were 'perfect'. I did not, by the by, ask if the sweet potato fries were 'bottomless' (note that to substitute sweet potato costs $1.49 extra).  Nevertheless, a good experience (perfect, from my stand point). I will go ahead and say that, from times past, the salads are very good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fort-worth?start=60,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003

64,Ally D.,"Bedford, TX",11,59,4.0,2.0,2014-05-01,"I had heard somewhat of a hype about Red Robin and was excited to try it. We went in around 9 on a Thursday and the place was almost empty. From first sight it looked really clean but after sitting there for a minute you start to notice all of the debris under the neighboring empty tables.  I ordered the Bleu Ribbon burger which included bottomless fries. My friend got a turkey sandwich. The burger came out looking nothing like the glorious picture on the menu. The golden, crispy onions in the picture were mushy brownish blackish onions smeared on the bottom of my bun. There was so much thousand island on it that the bun was soggy and I didn't even see the Bleu cheese. It didn't taste terrible but I would have much rather spent $10 on a burger at Rodeo Goat across town. The fries are bottomless and they give you a handful on your plate but the server never asked us if we wanted anymore. My friend's sandwich was burned. The bread was noticeably black. I don't think I'll try this place again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fort-worth?start=20,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006

28,Sarah S.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,5,,1.0,2015-03-01,"Let's talk about lunch today. We were seated, and the hostess asked us what we'd like to drink. My fiance and I ordered two plain teas, and a lemonade for our two-year-old. She told us they'd be out shortly, and that our server would be right with us. About three minutes later, the hostess is back at our table with our drinks. She drops them off (friendly) and leaves. We take a sip and realize that we had both been given sweet teas. When our server FINALLY showed up, we pointed out the error. He immediately corrected it, but with no Sweet n Low. We ask for some, and he says he'll get some, but he takes our order first. My fiance gets a burger and fries, our toddler gets mac n cheese and broccoli, and I get their Buzz Clucks and Mac n Cheese. After my fiance has finished HALF OF HIS TEA (and after being reminded) our server finally shows up with some Sweet n Low.  Our food comes out about when you would expect it to. We had no complaints about the food. Everyone has an idea as to what the food at Red Robin should look and taste like. This lived up to our expectations. There was just one issue- no silverware. No, our daughter's came with a little spoon, and my fiance had a burger, so that was't really that big of a deal. The issue was that I had mac and cheese and chicken strips tossed in buffalo sauce, and no silverware. The woman who obviously was the manager had dropped our food off, and said she'd get us silverware. She sent around ANOTHER server, who dropped off a tray with three steak knives and some napkins. She realized what was needed and said she'd go take care of it. My family began eating. I waited. Then our server shows up with a little tray of silverware, walked right past our table, and gave it to the people next to us WHO HADN'T EVEN ORDERED YET. At this point, I had waited so long I began picking at the mac and cheese with my fingers. We were FINALLY brought forks when I was halfway done with my pasta. When she dropped them off we told her I needed ranch for my chicken. I was told she'd be right back. It wasn't until after we asked our server (asking for a second time) and he deigned himself to bring it to me that I finally got ranch. My chicken was cold at this time. My fiance was so angry he went looking for the manager, who was nowhere to be found. We finished up, paid our bill, and left. It should be said that my fiance did not have his drink refreshed at all until the end of our meal when we were ready to pay.

First started by my mom and I wanting to order a trio... which consists of bottomless fries, sweet potato fries and union straws. When we placed the order our waitress went on to the kitchen and not 2 minutes later the manager ""don't remember her name but was working there at 12pm "" came to our table and said that since this is a "" Corporate "" Red Robin and not a "" Franchise "" that we're not able to order sweet potato fries, bottomless fries and onion straws. Mind you this order is simple and we were able to order this last time we were there ( not even a month ago ). So we said alrighty we'll get the sweet potato fries with the smoked bacon sauce ( as named on the menu ) with the garlic aoli and ranch. Then I decided to order the Gourmet Burger that came with bacon, cheese and a egg and my mom ordered a chicken wrap. Now this is where I would say the fries came out before the burger and wrap but that's the thing.... we never received our sweet potato fries... kinda weird. So the sauces without the sweet potato fries came out with our food. Now I wish I would have taken a picture of the Smoked Bacon sauce because it was completely unappealing. I was too focused on eating because I was starving lol, now before we received the sauces the manager said the sauce came with a Applewood Smoked Bacon but was called Bacon aoli and didn't know why "" corporate put that on there "" the sauce looked nothing like the picture in the menu... like not even remotely close. The bacon was fatty and wiggly, completely drenched in grease and tasted terrible. I could feel the grease slip and slide down my throat. The fries were slightly wet and wiggly as well. Told the waitress and sure enough the manager comes back around to bring us another one. This time my mom was on and business call and I was watching the game eating my foot. Nearly jumped when I realized she was just hovering over our table holding the sauce on a tray. Didn't care to say oh.. I'm sorry I'll come back but decided to just stand there and hover over my mom and I while she was on the phone and I was eating. So there was and awkward silence while she stood there for no joke literally 5 minutes straight. And once my mom was off the phone she said, "" well this is how our sauce is made and it might have a greasy texture "" and assured us the bacon was cooked and that she always gets compliments on the sauce.

My Wife ordered a ice cream brownie I got forced into helping her with.  I'm not a fan of the brownie it was way chewy and the strawberry glaze wasn't appealing.

It was too heavy with the bbq sauce and bacon and onions and mayo all on one burger, but when I had asked our server what was on it she didn't mention mayo so I guess I should have looked myself instead of taking her word. Who puts mayo and bbq both on a burger? The fries were cold, not sure if they were served that way or if it was from the environment.

2,Beverly C.,"Arlington, TX",14,72,91.0,5.0,2017-08-12,"I'm one of the first to tell someone that I'm not a fan of big chains. I prefer the mom-and-pop locales, but this time I'm going to give kudos to Red Robin for their choices.  When a person is trying to lose weight and get healthy, it's a struggle to find something worthy to eat at a restaurant. You get tired of the traditional chicken breast and side salad. Red Robin must have heard me moaning, though, because they stepped up. I adore burgers. I mean, I can make a great burger, so I know what a great burger should taste like. I'm a harsh critic, too, when it comes to burgers because come on--it's so basic. The meat should be the showcase of a burger. I can't stand a wimpy, little piece of dried up meat that's lost beneath a stack of add-ons and a bun that's six times as large as the meat itself. (That's for another review I still have to do.) I say all this as a preface to this: try the Wedgie Burger from Red Robin. When I perused the menu looking for something to eat at a burger place while still adhering to my low carb diet, I can tell you that I wasn't optimistic. My face told a story of disappointment mixed with sadness at not being able to savor the Fiery Ghost Tavern Double or gobble down a Whiskey River BBQ burger. But before I closed the menu and gave up my appetite to a side salad with dressing on the side of wet lettuce and unripened tomatoes, I spotted something--The Wedgie Burger. What was this? A burger stacked with bacon, tomato, guac and wrapped with lettuce. Hmmm. My interest was piqued. At least it's a burger, I thought, so I ordered it, but frankly, I didn't expect to like it. There's something that comes over someone who has been deprived of carbs from yeasty bread and cakes and cookies and rice and noodles and STOP! That something is an appreciation for ""other"" foods from the ""other"" food groups. After one bite of the Wedgie Burger, I was a fan of lettuce because it helped to keep my juicy, hot, delicious hunk of beef from burning my hands! Wow! I truly enjoyed every bite of my Wedgie Burger. The meat was the star of the show. Not the fancy toppings or the exclusive black sesame seed bun made from gluten-free flour ground in a rain forest by indigenous people. The MEAT earned top billing! YAY for cattle! Leaving a restaurant satisfied is what every eating establishment should want from its customers, and this lady did just that! I'll be back when I have a hankering for some protein lovin'. Anyway, that's my side of the menu! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fort-worth,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96

Now that that tid-bit of tastiness has been addressed, we can chat about the variety of Burgers, the glorious Grilled Cheese (4 different cheeses) Sandwich, the Cod and Chips......and what do Americans call these so called ""chips""?............That's Right: we know them as Hot, Thick-Cut, Fresh, Golden, Steak Fries!  But not just any Steak Fries..........Unlimited.......Hot, Thick-Cut, Fresh, Golden, Steak Fries!  What can I say The Steak Fries are my Favorite unless we are discussing RR's VooDoo Fries...Famous Red Robin Steak Fries topped with queso, bacon crumbles, fried jalapeño coins and a drizzle of Fiery Ghost® Pepper Sauce. Served with a side of ranch or Fiery Ghost Pepper Sauce. OMG!!!!  (Sorry, but I really like these 'tators) If your sign up for a free membership (Red Robin Royalty) you get special pricing on certain items, free burgers, discounts etc... it really kinda cool....and it's Free.

4,Qiana D.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,34,54.0,5.0,2017-10-19,This was my first time at Red Robin for Thursday night dinner and I really enjoyed it.  The restaurant was not crowded so we were able to order our food and have everything come out timely. We had the Guac burger; Chili Chili Cheeseburger and the Searious Salmon. The Freckled Lemonade was delicious. We barely got through one refill of the bottomless fries. Everything was cooked perfectly. I will definitely be a Red Robin regular.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fort-worth,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006
13,Angela S.,"Fort Worth, TX",0,12,,1.0,2017-11-05,"We walked in to an empty hostess stand.  After about 10 mins we were finally approached and seated.  However, we sat at our table for 20 mins and saw 3 diff servers and the manager walk around us without stopping at our table.  We never even were asked what we wanted to drink, so we left and went to BJ's.  BJ's was packed but we were acknowledged there and got quick service.  Dont waste your time here at this location...go elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fort-worth,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006
6,Davita T.,"Fort Worth, TX",2,11,14.0,1.0,2017-11-11,I just saw the unthinkable a young lady walking with 2 beers and she was smelling it with her nose down deep in the cups. (Can somebody please tell me can you really determine what kind of beer it is by smelling it(my answer is NO) just go and let the bartender remake them that would be the best thing to do. Can somebody please tell me your take on this situation PLEASE,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fort-worth,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005
