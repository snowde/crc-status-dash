47,Vicki S.,"Avon, MA",0,1,,5.0,2015-07-18,"We just left Red Robin soft opening in their new location at Patriot Place it is absolutely beautiful they did such a great job they actually have a garage door that opens out to a patio that overlooks the Patriots Stadium . Everything was terrific the food was served piping hot we ordered burgers well done they were perfect couldn't fault a thing everything was spot on! Bartenders and waitstaff are extremely friendly. Congratulations on your new location it's really EXCEPTIONAL! ........JOB WELL DONE. Red Robin corporate should be very pleased, so well organized  for a new location. The manager, Pat obviously  worked very hard to make this new location and opening a great success. I would highly recommend  this restaurant can not wait to go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-foxborough-2?start=60,2.548,2.548,2.548,2.548,2.548

38,Hang P.,"Boston, MA",18,18,3.0,2.0,2015-07-26,"My family and I come here (at the old location) often enough that we know what to order by the time we get there.  We were taken by surprise that there was a change of location, so we went to the new location and it looked VERY different than it did before. It seemed to be more modern, flashy, and smaller.  We had 4 people and a stroller, and were placed in a small booth when there were PLENTY of other places with larger amounts of table space. As for food, we usually order the onion ring tower. First few onion rings were great, until we got towards the bottom and I noticed a bitter, burnt flavor to the batter... My cousin agreed that the rings were over cooked. I got the guacamole bacon burger, MEDIUM WELL. Take a few bites of my burger to see that my burger was definitely well done, so well that the sides of my burger was burnt. There was a burnt aftertaste, after each bite I take.  The waitress was cool, she forgot some things we asked for (like lemon for my water) but I lived, not a big deal. I would've given my experience here a 1 but I've been coming to Red Robins for awhile now, and maybe their new location needs some getting use to? Or I just had bad luck, who knows.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-foxborough-2?start=40,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.12
35,Michele G.,"Medway, MA",0,2,1.0,1.0,2015-08-01,"Where do I start? Me & my husband had a gift certificate and ended up trying out the new red robin location tonight at Patriots Place we had enjoyed it before with our 3 sons. I opened the front door and there was a sharp piece of trim under the door that brushed my toe and cut my toenail in half! Yup I'm half. I stood in the lobby and told the 2 hostesses about it, they watched my toe bleed for minutes one of them even saying the blood is a puddle on your sandle now...before I asked for a band aid. I was waiting for my husband and was sat. Never asked again how my toe was. None of the staff had a smile, the outside deck area had a wash cloth they were ringing out in a bucket on the ground to wash the tables...Gross! Also on the ground was the busboy bucket that piled up on a Revolution soccer night. Service was super slow and super unfriendly. I went to the women's restroom which was directly across from the men's room which obviously isn't the issue. The men's room smelled so bad it had had a 'problem' and the mop was at the entrance, door open stinking out to the restaurant... gross!  Attention management: work with your staff, they are not happy. Attention Staff: I am a customer and matter, come check on me and your other customers don't make annoyed faces when a family comes and you need to combine tables!

57,James B.,"North Providence, RI",153,70,138.0,3.0,2015-08-08,Ok so I  went Sunday after work to have a great burger and found out they had relocated found it near Olympia sports. It looks amazing and takes up a corner with outside tables flat screen tvs and colored wooden brick panels!! I really love the way it looks! You walk in from 2 doors and there are at least 2 hostesses and they will seat you quick! We chose to sit outside because it was about 7 15 and still a gorgeous day at like 80 degrees with shade. So I ordered a great double angus burger with their bottomless garlic and herb Fries with a strawberry lemonade!! Can you say delicious? The burger was thick and tasty and the lemonade  was on point I will def return to this new red robin but they need to hire better help. Oh did I mention they were out of onion rings? What a bummer!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-foxborough-2?start=20,2.284,2.284,2.284,2.284,2.284
24,Alex Z.,"Watertown, MA",22,14,7.0,2.0,2015-08-14,"My Wife & I went to the Patriots preseason game last night and after seeing tons of Red Robin commercials, we decided this was the best time to give it a shot.  We got there and they told us the wait was going to be about 30 mins so we went to the bar to grab a couple beers while we waited.  Got large glasses at a great price.  Table was ready in 20... Great! Service was good, our waitress was pretty quick to take our order and bring out our second round.  I ordered the Pepper & Smoke Burger (their ""Ultra premium"" offering) and my wife got the BBQ Burger of some sort.   Things started to fall apart at this point... My wife ordered no Mayo on her burger and low and behold... it not only had mayo but a lot of it.  She got the onion rings with it b/c they were out of Sweet Potato fries... and she only got like 6 rings with it and they were not refillable. My burger was okay... I ordered it medium rare but it came out as Medium to Medium-Well... which in hindsight was fine with me b/c I'm not sure how ""premium"" the meat really was (in which case... torch that f*er).  Their bottomless steak fries were also just okay... they give you such a small portion of them that you end up ordering a second (especially b/c my wife finished her onion rings super quick).  Also got a side of cole slaw, which I enjoyed but you literally got 3 bites in a serving. All and All... not a great Red Robin experience.  If I'm going to pay 12.99 for a burger... it damn well better be an A+ burger.  I can go to some really upscale gastro-pubs in Boston and get a better offering for less $.  No complaints about service though... probably the only redeeming quality here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-foxborough-2?start=40,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.12
37,Ebonique F.,"Holliston, MA",54,22,5.0,4.0,2015-08-21,Always been a fan with their burgers. Very modern and trendy especially with its new location overlooking the stadium. Overall really good service. I was pleased with my veggie burger. I found the menu to be a tad intense since their earlier days of a simple diner type menu.

I had let them know we were coming in advance, but we ended up arriving about half an hour earlier than I had anticipated. The hostess was very friendly and we were seated quickly. Waiter was also super friendly, and we were served quickly, especially considering there were over 30 people between campers and counselors. The kids definitely enjoyed their meals as well as all of the crazy decor on display. The final icing on the cake was the bill, way lower than I had anticipated!

36,David M.,"North Attleboro, MA",0,4,,2.0,2015-09-09,"Tried the new location tonight and we were disappointed. Slow service, pushing the table top ziosk, forgetting utensils and napkins and not bringing them until five minutes after the food arrived. I don't go out to eat and expect to order remotely.

55,Brandon K.,"Westwood, MA",161,1505,24565.0,1.0,2015-09-26,"I have been to this Red Robin location a few times, and it's never impressing. The major issue here is the size of the restaurant (which may have be fixed now that they moved...), there is always a wait on weekends and weekdays (from certain hours), and the waiting area is always JAMMED. Then when your wait is finally over, and always over later than expected, the tables aren't normally cleaned to perfection. Just average. The food is good, specifically burgers and those cool onion ring towers, yet my experiences here have not been the same as the Millbury Red Robin, which is particularly better. Food is quicker, more gourmet, and there wasn't a wait at all on a Saturday (impossible here). Hopefully the new Red Robin in the South Shore Plaza will not be like this! 2 stars. UPDATE : Feb. 14, 2016 : Was hoping to revisit the Patriot Place Red Robin on Valentine's Day for Lunch, see if it has gotten any better since my last eh-eh visit. Website indicated NOTHING about closing.  So drove up here to find it closed, because of ""technical issues"". Won't ever be returning. With both Millbury & Braintree Red Robin locations, there is no way I'll ever fall for the un-reliability of the Patriot Place location. Too bad. 1 star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-foxborough-2?start=20,1.924,1.924,1.924,1.924,1.9240000000000002
52,Perri V.,"Chestnut Hill, MA",57,167,425.0,4.0,2015-10-27,"This was my first time at the new location, and it was a relatively good experience. My one complaint was the service at the front when we came in. There was a wait, as expected since it's a busy location, but the staff were very disorganized about it. None of the three people seemed to know what was going on, and two of them tried to seat us at the same time.  Other than that, our service was fantastic. Our waitress was very friendly and knew what we needed before we even asked for it. My fiancee and I ordered a burger to split, and she brought two plates and cut it in half without us requesting it, which was great. We had the Whiskey River Burger, which is my go to at Red Robin, and it was delicious, as always. I also highly recommend getting the campfire sauce to go with your bottomless fries. It's pretty much my favorite condiment of all time.  I'm not a huge fan of the updated decor and menu, but the food is still great, so it's worth a visit if you can get past the service on the front end.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-foxborough-2?start=20,2.32,2.32,2.32,2.32,2.32
34,Christina M.,"Rockland, MA",0,2,,2.0,2015-11-28,"Boyfriend and I came here before we attended the Monday night patriots game (11/23). Obviously, it was busy... Not a big deal. Put our names on the wait, they told us 15 minutes, but never asked our preference in seating... I only say this because when our table was ready at 15 minutes, the hostess brought us over to our table which was in a side room near the bar area, that was located where they have the outside patio seating... Mind you its 30 degrees, and they have the ""garage door"" OPEN, and our table is literally placed right in front of the wide open area, so the freezing cold air and wind was coming in... She drops off the menus and run... At this point, i am beyond upset that they didn't even ask when I put my name on the wait ""do you have a preference in where you sit?"".  I would have gladly asked to NOT sit in this area, considering we came for dinner to get out of the 30 degree weather, as we were going to be sitting out in it for 4 hours!!! Another thing that REALLY bothered me was, there weren't any heaters located near us to make the cold a little bearable... Only reason why we even decided to sit was, I overheard the host tell the next table besides us, that if they wanted to wait for another table (not in this area), it would be another 20 minutes, because they would be put back on the wait, instead of giving the next available table...  We ordered our food from our server Carlos, who was very nice, but could tell he was a bit overwhelmed, don't blame him one bit, it was crazy in there and his tables were so close together, he could barely move!!!  After sitting at this terrible table for about 15, my boyfriend couldn't handle it anymore, and asked a bartender very nicely if they could please shut the garage door to the outside, as no one was sitting out there. Her response was ""I'm sorry we can't, because in a while, everyone will be sitting out there..."" This really bothered me because it felt like this restaurant was more concerned about packing bodies in, and making all the money they can, instead of making sure their ""guests"" feel comfortable, and aren't freezing while waiting for a warm meal... Hence the reason why coming to a restaurant to get out of the cold for a while... A table in the corner of the same room that we were in, had opened up, and we asked to move over there. Carlos said go right ahead, and I apologized for moving, i just couldn't handle the cold coming in directly on my face, he was completely understanding of us moving. About 15 minutes later, we received our food. Sadly I didn't get the burger I originally ordered... But I ate it anyways because I was so hungry! Either way, I was pleased with my meal, and my boyfriend was happy with his. By the time we ended up leaving there were only two tables outside at this time and they were just drinking... I am sorry for this lengthy review, but I firmly believe that if you are going to have wide open doors to freezing cold weather, you may want to WARN your PAYING guests of where they may be sitting, or even have HEATERS available so that there is some kind of relief from the 30 degree weather... Carlos is only reason why this place is even getting 2 stars from me...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-foxborough-2?start=40,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152

We were seated in the bar area and basically ignored for about 10 minutes. I should've taken this a sign to head somewhere else, but my aunt and I had our hearts set on a burger, so we stayed. Our server seemed like he didn't want to be there, and the food followed suit. A burger with ""some pink"" came out so overcooked that it was black on one side, and the server didn't come back for another 10 minutes so I didn't even have a chance to send it back. And the ""bottomless"" fries are a bit of a myth when your server doesn't check up on you after you've finished your entire meal.

29,Jim S.,"Barrington, RI",3,24,14.0,2.0,2016-01-10,"Food: appetizers are small. You should probably get one each. Burgers are pretty good. The garlic seasoning is not worth the extra charge. Soft drinks are bottomless... Which brings me to another point. I took my kids. They are young. One got a float, one got a sprite. It would have been nice if the waitress asked before plopping another float in front of my son. I asked her to take it away, and she argued it was free refills. I told her I just didn't want my son having another. She kept arguing with me. Happily, my son just wanted a water and she left with the drinks.  Be aware, when you sit down, they point the kids to a tablet to order drinks and appetizers. What kid doesn't like a tablet. What kid wouldn't click the Games button on the tablet next. What kid would realize they just incurred a $1.99 Entertainment Fee. That's kind of BS. I argued it and after the third visit to pick up the check, they removed it.  Then there is the club. If you join the mailing list, you get some stupid points and the kids get a free dessert. I don't care about getting another junk mail so I said I would sign up. After they got their dessert, I had to go through the interview process. This isn't just giving your email. They want address, income, marital status, military status. Are they filing my taxes? I made up a bunch of garbage, got the bill, which defaults to 20% tip, unsubscribed from their list, and got out of there.

Nice lounge waiting area. On the weekends they blow up little red robin balloons and stack them in the front for kiddies. Sweet potato fries are not free btw. It's an upgrade.  If you want spicy, get the burger with the ghost chili but make sure you get the right size, they have a small version and a big version.

Zero concern about contamination and zero concern about possible allergic reaction. He said that cheese must have spilled onto the broccoli and that it wasn't a big deal.

The chicken sandwich was pretty good but definitely not teriyaki.  The Mad Love burger did not have the same ingredients that the menu described.  It did have a burger patty lettuce tomato and onion.

I was told by the same girl that it would probably be another 10 minutes. We chose to leave and find another place to eat instead.  Making people wait 40 minutes when they were initially told 15 to 20 minutes is a completely rude and unacceptable business practice in my book.
