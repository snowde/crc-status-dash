Anyway, the food was OK, pretty typical burger joint type food.  I don't eat hamburgers, so I opted for a seafood platter which was good, but basically just frozen boxed stuff.  Everyone else that was with me seemed to enjoy their food...but they're not as picky as me :)  I guess this is a good place for kids or teenagers, but I will not retur...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-frederick?start=60,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44

89,Kseniya P.,"Gaithersburg, MD",0,4,,2.0,2013-05-18,"We've gone to several Red Robins in the DMV, it's one of our favorite places. This location is by far the worst we've dined at. The servers have absolutely no team effort and need to re-learn basic serving priorities. Your table should not still be waiting on a drink when they are more than half way through their appetizers. We were watching our beers sit at the bar. We even reminded the server that dropped off our appetizer and then when our waiter came by reminded him. Instead of taking less than two minutes to bring our drinks that had been waiting, he decided to go to the next table, take their dessert order and then continue to put it in the system. Several staff walked by without delivering let alone glancing over at the numerous drinks waiting to be delivered. I had to walk up to the bar when a manager walked over and asked him if I could deliver my own beers. The manager replied with, ""Let me check that they're yours and I will bring them."" Our server ended up delivering the drinks and of course no courtesy or apology. You would also think the manager would do a table touch to see why a customer tried to come to the bar to pick up their drinks. The waiter also never once even offered waters while we waited. After our meal he asked if we wanted anything and when we said no thank you he replied with, ""Okay, good. I'll bring you your check.""

The location is great, right across the street from the FSK mall and just off of the highway. The interior was nice and cozy, if not a little cramped, but everything was very modern and clean.  This is one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants, and he convinced me to order the freckled strawberry lemonade...it was AMAZING. There are real strawberries mixed in and the whole drink is just mind-blowing, take my word for it. For $3.99 you get unlimited refills...and I took advantage of that by having 4 (including 1 to go!). Oops!  I ordered the bacon cheeseburger, and he ordered the Bonzai burger (a burger with pineapple). Both were really great, and they didn't fall apart like many burgers do. The beef was cooked perfectly too.  My only complaint was that the fries were kind of cold, and the burgers were a little pricey!

I walked in expecting it to be slightly dirty and full of greasy men chugging beer...but it was the exact opposite. The crowd was a mix of families, friends, and older people enjoying some delicious food while watching the huge TV. A young friendly host brought us to our table and it only took a minute for the waiter to arrive. Extra points.  After looking at the menu for about 15 minutes (the abundance of options made a selection very difficult), I settled on the guacamole bacon burger. Now, let me point out that its a general rule to never mix meat on a burger. I think it's strange and takes away from the entire burger-eating experience.  Thank goodness I broke that rule.  The guacamole bacon burger comes with a grid of bacon (yes, grid) that's perfectly cooked over as many patties as you'd like. I chose ""no pink"" because in the event that  meat does enter my mouth...it shouldn't be moo-ing.  It was love at first bite. All the toppings (lettuce, tomato, onion, and guac) blended together perfectly. The crispy fries were a perfect compliment to the burger, especially after I sprinkled their special seasoning and ketchup all over it.  My only complaint? That I didn't ask for it on a whole grain bun.  They also have a variety of salads and wraps for ""healthier"" choices.

She took the check back and updated it. She seemed a bit surprised that we wanted dessert. I would think it would be to their benefit to ""upsell"" the dessert.

I ordered the bacon guacamole and he got the royal robin and we both were happy. The fact that you can get bottomless fries is pretty cool too! If you're being healthy, you can also get bottomless broccoli. You can also get a lettuce wrap instead of a bun as well.

69,Sam C.,"Frederick, MD",6,38,,1.0,2014-12-16,"Since its grand opening a few years ago, the Frederick Red Robin has been locked into a tug-of-war battle with the Germantown location for the title of ""Shittiest Franchise in the Red Robin Chain."" And while the Germantown joint is slightly ahead (based on my last miserable experience there), Frederick is fighting hard to reclaim its rightful crown. How will they do it, you ask? By continuing to serve up undercooked burgers, flavorless watered-down drinks and shakes, cold (recycled?) fries, and nonexistent service. And I think this may be their year! Admittedly, I'm a glutton for punishment. Despite repeated abuse at the hands of incompetent cooks, witless managers, and a team of indifferent waiters, I keep going back. I know, I hate myself for doing it, but it's my memories of a better Red Robin from long ago and far far away, one with fantastic food & friendly staff that have me trying again and again to relive the great time that Red Robin was meant to be. Alas, I'm in denial. I refuse to admit to myself that this restaurant is so poorly managed and so dreadfully staffed that it's incapable of delivering the goods; i.e. a pleasant dining experience. During my last ordeal an impatient waitress took our orders and then disappeared. She never came back. Nearly an hour later an overgrown teenager wearing a black shirt (a manager perhaps?) stopped by the table and offered us refills on our drinks (the first and only time that night), but no explanation regarding our missing waitress. Did she go home for the night without handing us off to another server? Was she ok? ""Was the food ok?"" ""Can I get you folks anything else?"" These questions were never asked or answered. To answer them... who knows, who cares, the burger was grossly undercooked, and I would have liked a refill on the fries. Not that any of it matters since later that night I was doubled-over on the toilet, shitting my brains out. They advertise bottomless fries, but fail to mention the complementary E. coli that comes with your entree. The Red Robin concept, when properly executed, is awesome.

50,Jim P.,"Damascus, MD",30,7,1.0,2.0,2015-01-07,"Although I have lots to complain about for this location, I'll keep it as short as possible with one piece of advice: never come here within the last hour of operation: Me and my lady walked in around 9pm sharp on a weekday where they close at 10. Nobody at the host stand. Weren't approached until 5 minutes later. But prior to finally being approached, I saw management and other employees from a distance see us standing there and didn't let anybody know nor come up and approach us. The place had about 5-7 tables sitting down and there was only one server on. Never saw any other employee help him out or take a table for him. Looked like an every man for himself deal.  Got approached 10 minutes after sitting down since the server was overloaded with tables. Our servers name was Matt Cluckey or something like that. Thank god for this guy cuz he made everything better. Took care of us and made up for everything.  Final thought- for all those that didn't acknowledge us when we walked in, don't make me feel uncomfortable coming in during the last hour of operation. Your open. I'm a paying guest.

Problems with my back make it difficult to be seated in this situation, and when I asked to be seated at a booth instead, the response was somewhat frosty and cold from the hostess. Not the helpful and inviting response I expected. We were then left to be served by the bartender who was clearly too busy to provide any decent customer service to anyone. We sat with a view of the kitchen counter where the orders are placed for pick up. It was disappointing that our meals sat for nearly 10 minutes before the bartender could stop making drinks for other patrons and get our food. The food came to us warm not piping hot. During the course of our meal the bartender kept leaning over the bar asking us how our meal was. We felt somewhat disrespected as getting our attention from behind the bar and calling me ""Buddy""  instead of coming  over to our table and providing service should have been. When I asked for the check the bartender told us that he would bring it right away. He obviously forgot. I had to take my credit card over to the bar to pay.

75,David D.,"Frederick, MD",0,7,,4.0,2015-05-21,"Time of Visit:  May 21, 2015 at 11:45 am My Order:  Bleu Ribbon Burger                      Steak Fries                      Peach Iced Tea Total Rating = 3.9 (Four Stars) Red Robin is, of course, a large chain with many locations.  I visit this location often, as it is close and you can get a good meal.  I'll admit I made this trip because I'm a member of their Royalty Club and I had a free burger coming.  Because of that, I ordered a burger I had never tried before, the Bleu  Ribbon Burger.  Although the food didn't score exceptionally well, the non-food factors bump up the overall rating. Location and Access, Overall Rating 5 The place is real easy to find, just off I-270, right at the entrance to the Francis Scott Key Mall.  It's situated across the parking lot from Sears, so there is a LOT of parking available.  Great Access and parking, so it gets a 5. Facilities, Overall Rating 4 This building is only a few years old and was recently remodeled when the chain did a reimaging.  There is quite a bit of seating, but none outside, so you can't eat outside on a nice day.  Restrooms were adequately sized, clean, and easy to find.  Overall, a 4. Staff and Service, Overall Rating 5 I sat at the bar this trip, so I didn't have much interaction with the hostess, just enough to tell her I was going to the bar.  The bartender recognized me, as she had served me many times before.  As usual she was very friendly and responded quickly to my needs.  The menu has lots of options, including several non-burger entrees.  Even though they had to cook my burger to order, it still didn't take too long.  The service was excellent, a 5. Presentation, Overall Rating 4 The food comes out on a small platter, with the fries placed in a silver-colored cone/cylinder.  Very attractive, but not something that takes your breath away, a 4. Meat, Overall Rating 4 My burger was cooked just as I like it, cooked all the way through with no pink, yet there was still some juiciness to it.  Not dripping down your arms juicy, but not dry either.  It was char-grilled but didn't have an overwhelming charred flavor.  Very good in my opinion, a 4. Bun, Overall Rating 4 The standard bun option for this burger is an onion bun and I didn't change that.  It was a good, firm bun that held up well in the sandwich, but wasn't tough or dry.  It had a good flavor and went well with the burger, a 4. Toppings, Overall Rating 3.5 Bleu cheese:  The cheese had good texture and tasted really good.  Bleu cheese doesn't melt well over the burger, but just softened instead.  Because it was crumbles instead of a slice, the distribution across the burger wasn't even and some bites had a lot of cheese while others had only a little or none.  Pretty average for Bleu cheese, a 3. Steak sauce:  I can't say this did a lot for the burger, but it wasn't bad, a 3. Chipotle aioli:  I didn't really notice this and wouldn't have known it was on the burger, except for the slight heat it gave the sandwich.  But, again, it wasn't bad, a 3. Tomato slices:  This was just very average tomatoes, like you can get in any supermarket out of season, so they didn't add much flavor to the burger.  But since they did add a nice fresh juiciness that the sandwich needed, I'll give them a 4. Shredded lettuce:  I don't think shredded lettuce adds much to a burger, other than a few greens for your diet.  When the lettuce is shredded, you lose the crisp bite of a lettuce leaf.  It didn't detract from the burger, but sure didn't add anything either, a 3. Onion straws:  These were certainly the dominant topping on this burger.  They were crispy and held up well until the end, a 5. Balance/Taste, Overall Rating 3 The burger maintained its integrity all the way to the end, which I think was mainly due to the onion bun.  The standard bun Red Robin uses sometimes doesn't hold together, especially if moister toppings are used.  The onion straws dominated the flavor, although the bleu cheese bite did come out at times.  The bun was just a little too big for the patty.  While there was a little meat in each bite, in a few bites there was very little.  Good flavors, but the balance was a little off, so I'll give it a 3. Sides, Overall Rating 3.5 Steak Fries:  I'm not a big fan of steak fries, as they don't seem to get the crispiness I like.  Except for when they first came out, these fries quickly become soft.  You can have as many refills as you want, but I really only got a refill because I could, so only a 3. Peach iced tea:  This tea had a good peach flavor, and I wasn't overwhelmed with sweetness.  A good flavor and balance, but some might want it a little stronger, 4. Value, Overall Rating 3 Since I got this burger for free, it was a good value this time, but I don't think I would get this particular burger if I had to pay full price.  It costs a little more than most of their burgers and just doesn't warrant the extra cost, in my opinion.  I'll give it a 3.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-frederick?start=60,2.68,2.68,2.68,2.096,2.68

From the moment I stepped in the door, she  was super helpful. Her hostess was swamped, so she stepped right in to seat me.  I ordered a Western BBQ burger with sweet potato fries and a Freckled (strawberry) lemonade. I noticed the burger was taking a little while, but I didn't think much of it. A minute or two later, it arrived. It was huge! Really tasty too... a little to much ""char"" on the edges for a medium-well burger, but still very good. Wouldn't go as far as calling it ""gourmet"", but it was a satisfying lunch.   My sweet potato fries were limp and cold, but before I could finish my first fry, the manager showed up to my table with a fresh, piping hot basket of sweet potato fries. She explained that she accidentally sold my burger, and that they had to make me a new one, which explained the wait. She said she also ""didn't like how my fries looked"" on my plate, so she took the initiative to bring me some fresh ones. She really didn't have to do that and I was really impressed at her level of attention to detail.

On March 26, I have decided to phone in my order and picked it up at the RR by the FSK Mall.  When I got to the restaurant, the lobby where the hostess was standing behind the podium had a really funny smell. After I told the hostess that I was going to be picking up my food, she told me to sit at the bar and the bartender will get my food for me. No problem. I sat by the bar and watched some college basketball. The atmosphere of the restaurant was okay, but the smell from the lobby was approaching its way into the dining area. The restaurant was full, as it was the evening and it was Easter eve. Also, the bar was very clean, free of dirty plates and glasses.  When my food was ready, the bartender gave me my food which was neatly placed in the box with some fries. The gourmet burger I ordered was the Whiskey River BBQ Burger. I ordered that particular burger because I really wasn't feeling the other burgers that were on the menu via RR's website. As far as the fries, I felt that if I redeemed a free burger for my birthday, then I should've gotten at least 2 or 3 handfuls of fries. As far as the burger, it tasted good, except that I had to scrape the shredded lettuce because it looked and tasted soggy and I did not get a tomato in my burger. Overall, this place gets 4 stars for a nice interior, including the bar but 2 stars for the smell of the restaurant, soggy lettuce and no tomato.

They changed back from the easy going relaxed upgrade to a more child friendly atmosphere. It felt like more of a Chucky Cheese with kids running around. It lost the Friday's or Chili's vibe which is where it seemed to wanted to be going in too. They took away the Happy Hour after 8 pm which is a small perk when get off late from work and wanting to have a reasonable priced beer and watch the end of a sports game. They cut back on the selection of alcohol to a bare minimum. I am fine with the changes if they would just choose what direction they want to go. Only other change which seems to be the norm is that all apps and drinks are ordered on the touch pads. This seems to slow down the service since the designated person to the table does not care about a tip or service. They basically are a food walker. I know that has to suck and sort of understand.

Lastly, Red Robin pulls the switcharoo with kids drinks.  Two of their kids drinks are not bottomless but it's written on the menu in an ambiguous manner as every other specialty drink is bottomless (all but two of eight). Food takes forever and drink refills are impossible to get while you're still in need of them. In two months, I've been here three times, with the same experience.

For starters a place which is advertising as a gourmet burger joint and only two cooking options. Pink or no pink. Sad. Really sad. I like my burgers med rare at most and was not an option. Servers where milling about doing nothing. Got father in laws order wrong. How hard is a hamburger with just mustard and onion?  Had cheese and lettuce and tomato. When asked to fix it they did but had another one out within 4o seconds. Fresh made, probably not. Final straw was the fact that the servers don't even take payment. Pay on tablet left at table.

That signature must have been in crayon and done by a 4 year old. Ive had this before and it had never looked like this. The cheese was almost melted off of the burger. Like it was put on the meat 2 minutes before going on the bun. And the bacon looked nothing like real bacon. It was microwaved bacon with a sorry attempt for peppercorn crackles. The fries were old and when I asked for my free refill I received only 6 fries (my kid thought it was funny that he could count them).  And by the time I saw my server again my kids were ready to go home.

Glad to see management has made changes for the better! Horrible service. Our waitress was nice enough and trying but they were short staffed in the kitchen. So management sent her to the kitchen. So we never could get anything we needed. Plus saw at least 3 managers walking around but none offered any assistance. In our section a man at another table even stood up and yelled ""can we please get some service"". A manager looked at him and then walked away. I don't fault our server at all, this is a clear failure of management. If you need to put a server on the cook line, assign her tables to someone else. Don't just leave customers with no server.  The food is barely mediocre. My chili cheese fries were burned and the chili tastes like dog food.
