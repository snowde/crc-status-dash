I entered tonight and saw a meeting of four people huddled around the hostess station.  There were no other customers waiting.  Only one person even noticed I was there, but she merely looked up and quickly returned her gaze to the meeting. No acknowledgment 'welcome to red robin, be with you in a moment'.  All I saw were employees backs and the top of their heads.  After a minute, I gave up and went to the bar to find a seat. I noticed the bartender, busy fixing drinks, and helping a waiting customer with a to-go order.   There were no other servers helping in the bar and no effort was made to acknowledge me.  I waited for about 5 minutes, then just grabbed my stuff and left.  as I past the hostess station, I told the person I was being ignored so I am leaving. it was early on a Thursday evening.  the parking lot was fairly empty and I saw a lot of servers. I remember coming in, holding the door for a Mom carrying a baby, yet thinking where are the hostesses that are normally swarming around the door. I've been coming here since they opened, but now looking back over the past 15-20 visits the last 10-12 weeks, I have not had a manager once stop at the table to ask about the service. I called back later from the restaurant. that I went to instead to tell the manager they lost a customer tonight and why.  I think the four person huddle at the hostess station was one of the managers having an employee pow-wow.  Don't distract your servers by having meetings like that.  the employees have to give the boss the attention they demand, but in this case, the customer was ignored, forgotten and in my case - gone.  No sale for the business, no nice tip for the server.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fredericksburg?start=40,1.9280000000000002,1.9280000000000002,1.9280000000000002,1.9280000000000002,1.9280000000000004

It seemed like an eternity for our server Aleeya to bring out our drinks, which was nothing complicated - we ordered 3 waters. Well it only got worse from there. When she came back, we put in an order for some guacamole and chips along with our food. Our appetizer never came, just our food. So we told the server who brought our food out to just cancel the appetizer. Maybe 5-7 minutes after getting our food, she comes over and was like ""oh I was told your appetizer never came out. Don't worry I'll remove it from your bill."" No sh*t Sherlock! We weren't going to pay for something we never got. Well she didn't come back to our table for another 20 minutes - our fries had been gone for bout 10 min and we wanted more and my daughter needed a refill - when she did come back, this worthless server was coming to bring us our damn check and quickly put it away when we asked for more fries and a refill. Where does the damn customer training they supposedly get come into play!? Then when we finally ask for our check, she gives us someone else's bill (more than what our real bill was) which she apologized for. Not only was she terrible, a different server, Jason, brought me a refill which I didn't ask for. Its apparent that she needs to take some notes from him on how to provide customer service. After I paid, I asked to speak to the manager when we were headed out. Manager came over and I explained about the horrible service we received and all she said was ""Oh I'm sorry that happened. It must be an off day for her because she's one of our best servers."" Really that's all you do, just apologize!?

As far as service goes, I can't recall it being anything other than terrific... Then again, I have always been in a great mood whenever I visited this place because I was fortunate enough to be in the presence of some amazing company. Their presence definitely enhanced my entire experience at Red Robins each and every time! Unfortunately, unlike my first visit, today's bottomless sweet potato fries left me utterly unsatisfied. Due to the fact that the fries were mostly burnt, the taste was far from its typical crisp and freshness. I made two orders of the fries in hope that the Fries Chef would redeem themselves by serving up a blazing hot, crispy (on the outside), soft (in the inside), and simply mouth-watering batch of fries but the second batch was as disappointing as the original one that came along with my Sautéed 'Shroom. Speaking of which, this was one of the greasiest burgers I've had at Red Robin. During my first visit, the Crispy Arctic Cod was so delicious that I inhaled the entire burger and fries in less than 10 minutes. To reiterate, the 'Shroom was overly greasy and the fries were burnt, which leave A LOT to be desired. I won't be returning any time soon. The taste of my horrific meal still lingers quite strongly.

40,David L.,"Fredericksburg, VA",1,21,,1.0,2015-03-21,"This is most definitely the last time I step foot in this Red Robin. If friends from other areas want to go to one where they live I will join them but never again will I go to the Red Robin in Fredericksburg. Went there this past Friday night and as a member of their rewards program my wife had a coupon for a free burger. Server was nice. She asked if we were members of their reward program. We said yes and told her we're eligible for a free burger.  My wife ordered one of the ""Red Robin's Finest"" burgers. We were served our meals. Now I want to add that the burger was ordered cooked ""medium"". However, it was delivered ""well done"". If I were paying for it I definitely would've sent it back. Instead, we reasoned that It's free so why complain. We ate our meal and out comes the check... The server says, ""Unfortunately, the burger you ordered is a premiere burger and it doesn't qualify for your free coupon. But your coupon is still good through the end of the month ago so free to come back before then."" EXCUSE ME?? Why are you telling me this now and not, say, before you told your cooks to make it, then serve it to us, and let us eat it?!  I ask to see a manager. The manager comes over and apologizes but takes the server's side. ""My server says that you didn't tell her about the coupon until after the order was placed."" WRONG. But I'm staying calm and say, ""Well can I just pay the $3-$4 difference between the burger we ordered and one that we were eligible for?"" She says, ""No we can't do that. But I'd be happy to have them make you a free item on the menu to go."" So let me get this straight? You'd rather give us a free $10 item rather than take the $3-$4 difference I offered? I declined her offer, saying that we were full, have plans with friends after this, and are not gonna wait around for food that's just gonna sit around making my car stink while I'm doing everything else I was going to do on Friday night. Manager was no help. I believe she thinks she handled it the right way, but this is the hospitality business and you failed. Server was borderline dishonest most likely to save face in front of her manager. Food was good but not great. That's the last time I ever go to this Red Robin. Sidenote: I have a soft spot for servers that work hard, are friendly, and try to make an honest living. When I really appreciate good service I tip around 30% but very rarely do I ever tip below 18% because it really is a very hard job. In fact, I told my wife before this debacle began ""I'm going to leave this server a $7 tip (which would be 100% since my meal was $7 and my wife's burger was supposed to be free) That, of course, did not end up happening. Maybe 5 times in my life have I left a 10% or lower tip because of bad service. 2 of those times were at this Red Robin in Fredericksburg.

Short story: We ordered an appetizer that we never got because the server forgot to put it in the computer. He did apologize, still brought us the appetizer but suggested that we tell the manager ourselves about the mishap if we wanted to get the app comped. Ummm...excuse me? Since when is it the customer's responsibility to fix a server's mistake? The manager did come over to our table with the app, dropped it off, never apologized or said a word. She was incredibly rude to say the least. In the end, we got charged for the appetizer and the server's mistake. Unfortunately for him, it reflected on his tip. As for the food..it was fine.
