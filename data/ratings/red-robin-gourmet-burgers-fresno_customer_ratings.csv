Unfortunately it seems like the staff needs work on speed of service and hosting tables. When we got there, we were told that there's a 10 to 15 minute wait for a table. Yet right to our left was an empty booth! I figured that they were going to fill it with a group of 4 or so customers. But when we were seated, it was still a booth! Just up the ramp instead. My gf and I waited about 50 min for food. Not cool.

They just stare at us like its the first time they have ever seen Latinos before. The wait is long to be seated and the place can be empty and we still wait long. The Hosts flat out suck, the waiters are hit and miss, the food takes awhile to arrive even when the place is empty. I live near river park, and my family and I just drive across the way to the Clovis location by Sierra Vista Mall, where we always feel welcomed and receive customer service with a smile.

141,Josiah B.,"Boise, ID",0,32,22.0,3.0,2013-06-24,"I'll just start off with the food was great as always!  Tried the promo Burserker burger and it was deeelicious!  That being said, here's the digs... The greeting/hostess staff at this location were impersonal and every employee that walked in and clocked in for their shift looked like they were going to work at the morgue or something.  We were hardly payed attention to during our waiting for a seat.  This was our first time to this location.  We arrived for lunch at 11:30 and there was a restaurant full of empty tables but for some reason had to wait 10 minutes.  How could this many tables be open without the opportunity to start dining?!  And this wasn't even explained to us while we had to wait.  We sat there confused, frustrated, and almost walked out.  We really wanted Red Robin for lunch and we've always enjoyed RR restaurants and our past experiences at them.  Needless to say, as we were finally getting brought to our table, there was an employee sleeping at the table next to us.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!!!!!!  How unprofessional can you be?  I was pretty upset at this point and mentioned to our waitress how unprofessional that was and she told us that this employee works 2 jobs and that she's tired.  WOW!!!  But she did finally tell the girl and she moved to the other side of the restaurant after she glared at my wife.  Way to go super tired employee, maybe you should sleep in your car so nobody has to actually bring up the fact that you're sleeping in the restaurant that people are eating in!!!  WTF?!!!  I observed the manager throughout our dining experience and he was about as friendly as a fence post.  I've never been to a Red Robin like this.  Usually everyone is upbeat and helpful and respectful.  It just shows that a crappy manager with no excitement doesn't challenge his staff to be at that level either.  It's as if he didn't care about what was going on.  Very sad!  Also, the hostess didn't say anything to us as we walked past her while we were leaving...go figure, this was the champ that reflected the excitement of the manager so I wasn't shocked not hearing, ""Have a great day!"", or ""Thanks for coming in!""  But lastly, our waitress ended up doing a fantastic job, our food was delicious as always, and we were paid attention to throughout the rest of our time there.  I would love to recommend this Red Robin but it needs to be kicked up a notch before I ever go back in there.  First impressions are everything.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-fresno?start=140,2.96,2.96,2.96,2.604,2.96

79,Anthony K.,"Oceanside, CA",3711,153,1151.0,4.0,2013-09-17,"NEW MENU!! I'll say that again NEW MENU!!!  This is the place to go for burgers....and bottomless steak fries....the sauces for the onion rings are so good...and the seasoning for the burgers goes great on the fries... And I'm a sucker for any place that has Sam Adams Octoberfest!! Brings me back to my days in Boston!! Who would have thought a chain restaurant would make such a delicious burger. Located in the large UTC shopping complex, you'll find a Red Robin. Plenty of parking outside,if you don't mind walking, though it can get quite busy fighting for a spot with all the other shoppers.  Walk in and the bar is hidden away to the left by all the TV's and plenty of seating (I don't think I have ever had to wait for a table here) To the back is the kitchen with glass front that allows you to see the cooks working hard... or is it hardly working!!  Seriously though the new menu is awesome! Spicy Thai sauce and ranch on the basket of fries is a big reason why we love you Red Robin!! I get the Royal Red Robin Burger and I am continually impressed! Although over the years the serving size of fries they give you for the ""bottomless"" fries has gotten smaller, its bottomless, so we still get our fix!! Chicken salads are huge and the Caesar  wraps on funky green tortillas are bomb too!  Great job Red Robin for not dropping the ball after over 10 yrs! Although I still have hard feelings for you closing down locations in North County as I have to drive from Carlsbad and this is the closest location.

The place was very empty with maybe five tables having people eating at them and we were seated very quickly but that was the best part of the meal. The waitress took our orders and walked away and we waited and waited till finally my friends asked me if this is how all service is in California. I told them no and tried to explain that they were probably understaffed. But that didn't work when my friends wife pointed out the four staff members in the corner   with the manager. After waiting almost an hour for our food to arrive cold we asked for some extra napkins, a refill on our drinks, and some sides and plates for our kids to which the waitress replied of course. But yet again nothing was brought to our table even after reminding her twice.  I love red robin and I cannot believe the service we received.

I'm so impressed with the service here I thought I'd be able to finish this before anything got here but I already have my margarita and my appetizers. I can't enough how satisfied I am with the service here. I myself work in customer service and it's so important to have the qualities and personality friendliness and be informative like Dana.

We got there at about 745-8pm, as we waited for a few others to join us. We waited about 7-8 minutes for a server to come to our table to get out drinks going, (and that was from one server) next, 8 minutes later, I finally got my freckled lemonade, (from a different server), 9 minutes later, (a third server came to our table) and had asked if we wanted any appetizers, yet, he did not even take our order, he said he will send our server over to our table, (which we were unsure of who our server was since we had so many people come to us.) 6 minutes later, a woman named jasmine who was our server came to take our appetizers order. Our guests got there, & waited for her for at least 10 minutes to come to grab their drinks. As one of our guests ordered a freckled lemonade, it looked like water & tasted nothing like my drink. So, we waited to try to grab her to tell her he just wanted a water, still no where to be around or found, so we grabbed the manager to get it for us. We then placed our orders, I ordered the whiskey river BBQ salad, and my father did as well. Didn't take too long at all for our food, that was the good part. She brought us our food, and I received a salad and my father received a burger, which was not what we ordered. The manager then fixed that for us and apologized, fixed his order, and told us our server will not be back that he will be taking care of us for the rest of the evening. (Whoo! He was awesome!) she later came back, and after everyone was half way done eating, my father and I did not even start yet, because I asked for a fork for us to eat our salads with and she eventually brought us one. Asked for extra napkins and utensils, she brings us one napkin and a bunch of knives, (she could have at least brought us some scissors so we could cut the napkin into 5 pieces.) we were all very disappointed at this time, the manager took over, & we had eaten. The waitress had the brought us boxes, (which I really didn't want to even take my food home it was so bad.) and she said, ""I'm not sure what the problem here was or what I did wrong, but my manager took 46$ off of your bill for whatever reason that was."" I was in awe that a server would say that to a customer. I, myself, am a server, and would not EVER say that to a customer. Ever. Extremely rude!

I was really hoping for a better experience since my last visit, but every time we've dined here, it seems understaffed and we usually have to wait a long time before our food comes out. It didn't seem to be all that busy tonight, yet it took them at least 25 minutes to buss the table across from us that was empty since before we sat down. My husband's fish sandwich was tasty, but I can't say the same for what I got. I ordered the soup and salad combo, and although my clam chowder was good, I cannot say the same about my salad. It had a funky taste to it, like it had been sitting in the refrigerator all day. Not fresh at all! I didn't send it back because we had already waited so long for our food and being that we had our two young daughter's with us, it was any minute before they got anxious, so I just ate it anyway. Well, BIG mistake. I ended up having a really bad stomachache when I got home and then throwing up a few hours later. I won't bother to call and complain, because based on everyone else's reviews, it doesn't seem like they care too much about their quality of food or service like they did in the past.

My biggest gripe is with the amount and frequency of their ""Bottomless fries"". They give you maybe 10 steak fries at a time, and when you ask for more, it takes about 10 minutes before they bring them to you. So in all reality, you're looking at maybe 20 fries during your whole meal. They also seem to have the same policy about refills (ever on water). I suspect this is a dirty money-saving tactic.

For starters we usually go for a combo of zucchini fries and mozzarella sticks - all the healthy stuff, right?! Then for mains I usually switch it up. The crispy chicken burger is good, always really crispy as advertised, hot, a generous sized piece of meat. The bun doesn't fall apart, and it's pretty filling. The whisky river chicken burger is good too. I sometimes go for a salad or the whisky river chicken wrap for something a bit lighter. Fries are bottomless, so they give you a smaller portion than they used to but will always bring more if you ask. My husband's a fan of the burnin' love burger. The menu is really extensive but the burgers are definitely the highlight. The bar has good options, several beers on tap, and a decent selection of liquors (including more than 2 kinds of gin, which I appreciate!). There are a ton of sugary cocktails on offer, though not my scene. I can't recommend its wine selection, though they do have a sangria thing that does the job if you want to walk the line between wine and booze.

There usually fluffy meaty steak burgers came a bit too done this time, but fries are not consistent anywhere so it must have been the batch. I could have, should have asked for a new bunch but I was so full from my burger. New for me was the Italian soda. A bit too sweet, but still ok.

We ate for a less at Colorado Grill, which is just as tasty. Sorry Red but you are not going to get frequent visits at those prices.

I don't know if it's just because I was one of the first customers of the day but I was treated awesomely and the food was the best it's ever been. Whatever the case may be, everything was on point today. I didn't even mind paying the $1.99 entertainment fee to play some games with my son.  My California chicken burger was cooked to perfection. The bacon was crispy, the avocado was fresh and ripe, the cheese was melty .... yum. I also upgraded to garlic fries which were also amazing! My son had the pizza and it looked tasty.  My server was nice. She had a great attitude and had a positive vibe about her. I like visits like these.

They seemed to like it. They didn't say anything bad about it, which is good I guess? I'm fat/pregnant so I got the ghost pepper burger thing with the endless fries. I expected the burger to be spicier. I was surprised by how many jalapeños they put on this thing though. They put some on the bottom bun, in between the 2 patties, and on top. Putting 20 jalapeños on something isn't going to make it any spicier. It's just going to taste like jalapeño.  Like, I wanted this burger with some jalapeño. But it's like I got jalapeños, with some burger. Lol. Regardless, after picking off half of them, it was a good burger. The fries were okay.
