13,OT S.,"Houston, TX",0,58,13.0,3.0,2017-08-04,"A-OK ... They were quite busy for a midday Friday.   The walking space between table-seating, bar-seating, etc. could have been slightly more generous. There was a LOT of RR-staff running around ... probably  more  ""in-training management | supervisors "" than would be normal.   The pattern for servers through the store is chaotic and not well thought-through.  Someone always seems to be in another's way. The layout is similar to Chili's, with table seating on each side of the U-bar. For a hamburger joint, the menu is very extensive.; including many options for toppings, condiments, buns, whatnot ...   Their ""Whiskey River BBQ""  burger was pretty good, but the burger-patty does get lost in the fixins.   When I asked to explain the difference between the $15 burgers, $11 burgers and $7 burgers, the server did not really know, so eventually someone from the kitchen showed-up to ask me what I wanted to know .... geeeze.  in a nutshell, cheaper burgers  are made with 80:20 ground beef, middle priced burgers are supposedly 90:10 ground beef, and then there's Angus Beef  (fat content not disclosed). Even accounting for bottomless-fries, I felt their burger prices were at-least 25% too high.   I was not really impressed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-friendswood-2?start=20,2.476,2.476,2.476,2.476,2.476

The staff is friendly and very helpful recommending a good burger. The salsa and guacamole is not that impressive. It's something 1 person can take down pretty easily. The burgers were pretty good but the bottomless fries took a while to refill.

25,Maria W.,"Houston, TX",321,849,3943.0,5.0,2017-08-06,"The manager came to our table to thank us for our service, he mentioned Red Robin's Webster location just opened on Monday, July 31st.  I had no idea, really, I knew the waiters and waitresses were messing up on where plates were supposed to go, but it wasn't anything that wasn't understandable.  For only 2 guests, we were seated quickly on a Saturday night. The restaurant was packed, and we were seated in the bar area. It was nice, but not too noisy. Our waitress was Ivy, a nice quirky lady with a love for makeup and her job. She was the  , so attentive, caring about her customers and her tip. She was on top of it!  Options for a pescatarian? The Salmon burger, Cod burger or just go completely vegetarian and get the Gardenburger or the Boca Veggie burger. A pretty good selection, as most burger places barely any selection for non-meat eaters. Sadly, say you want to Banzai burger, but minus the meat they can't do the no charge like Cheddar's, every substitutions is charged no matter what. No big deal, I ended up getting the salmon burger and a friend got his FREE birthday burger since he is an August baby and apart of the royalty rewards program. After being indecisive, he settled with the bacon cheeseburger with a extra runny egg.  Oh yeah, the bottomless steak fries!!! However, there is an up charge on the garlic parmesan fries and the sweet potato fries.  The garlic parmesan fries were on point delicious. Hot and crispy. The signature steak fries were perfect: hot, crispy, and paired greatly with those different sauces. If you plan on getting any sauces: the campfire, buzz ranch, thai chili, and buzz sauce is so good!! It beats your regular fries with ketchup, or fries with mayo, or even fries with mustard duo.  The salmon was cooked perfect: light pink color, no skin, and tender. I opted out for the blackened seasonings because I'm no fan, but I'm pretty sure it would have tasted good. My friend's egg wasn't runny enough, but our awesome waitress, brought him out another super uncooked yellow part of the egg just for his burger.  I had the best chained restaurant experience here and I hated big chained restaurants. Very well!  Also, I haven't been to Red Robin's in years, last one, I went to was the horrible one in Pearland. It's the worst! I told the manager of this one and he said, ""not to tell them."" Now, that I'm thinking of it, maybe he could be managers for both restaurants? Uh, oh well, at least now he knows I like this location better!!  Kudos to the Webster Red Robin's!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-friendswood-2,2.644,2.644,2.644,2.644,2.644

The building sits in the parking lot with Dick's Sporting Goods, Total Wine along with other stores.  The store is teetering 3.5-4 stars. The food was good. The service was fast and friendly. There is a family atmosphere. Being that it is new to the area and there is mall parking, the parking was pretty bad. We were able to burn some calories walking back to the car after our meal. Upon arrival we were seated promptly. Hostess was very hospitable. The waiter arrived promptly and took our drink orders.  We had a party of 4 with two indecisive teens, so it took us a minute to decide on appetizers.  Once ordered, they came to table hot!  The fried zucchini is pretty good. Cut too thick for my liking but flavorful.  The burgers are good as well. Not as juicy and tender as I would've liked but ok. The star of the show was the chicken tortilla soup.  I ordered it on a whim as the kids and my dude wanted bottomless fries of which they did not finish their initial serving.  The soup is superb. Full of chicken, avocado, beans, sour cream...don't sleep on this soup at the burger joint!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-friendswood-2,2.316,2.316,2.316,2.316,2.316
19,Derrick R.,"Austin, TX",0,2,,1.0,2017-08-14,"We stopped by the Red Robin Baybrook Mall location in Friendswood, TX for a late lunch. We were seated next to a couple RR staff in uniforms and noticed one waitress showing her bra strap to a fellow seated at another table. On to the food... My friend ordered a BLT with ""bottomless"" fruit (refills were delivered in a pill cup sized container, seriously).  I ordered the prime rib au jus sandwich that sounded delicious but came to the table as thin sliced previously frozen gristley deli cold cuts. It was pre-sliced, packaged grocery store roast beef. It had that iridescent coloring of bad meat and it smelled rotten. Rubbery and microwaved. Imagine expecting PRIME RIB and getting a 7-11 quality sandwich for 15 bucks, much less a serious case of food poisoning. RR should take this off the menu or call it what over processed spoiled product it is.  Manager acted confrontational and rude upon us pointing out the problems with the food and treated us in an unfriendly inhospitable way.

37,Tim K.,"League City, TX",0,21,4.0,2.0,2017-09-18,"Today, is my birthday and I chose to eat at the new Red Robin in Clearlake. I was so excited and even signed up for my Red Robin Royalty membership.  The waitress promised me a birthday sundae after our meal and asked if I would like them yo sing happy birthday too. Of course I quickly accepted and was even more excited to be there.  We ordered and the food came. My wife complained that her fries were cold and soggy and she ordered an onion roll for her burger (she got a white roll).  My burger was okay but definitely not 'gourmet'. The patty was small and pretty dry.  My wife asked for additional mayonnaise to add some moistness to her burger.  We complained to our waitress about the cold fries and dry burgers. She did bring fresh hot fries but did nothing to rectify our burgers. She blamed the kitchen staff about my wife's burger not having the correct hamburger bun. She only said, ""It's not my fault because I entered onion bread"". She did nothing to rectify and never offered to remake her burger. She reluctantly ate the burger.  When we finished our meal we were waiting for my birthday sundae and birthday song. It never came. My wife asked the waitress about the birthday sundae she promised beforehand. The waitress responded that she will enter the sundae and add it to our check.  Well, this was not a good birthday dining experience. It was stressful and VERY expensive. Two burgers, two fries and two drinks costed me $32.00 without the tip. I'm a kind guy so I left a $5.00 tip .... Wow! $37.00 and I never got my birthday sundae and a birthday song!  In summary, this place is much too overpriced for an average burger. Five Guys and Smash burger are half the price and twice the burger.  My wife promised to take me out to dinner tomorrow for a 're-do-over' so I can have a birthday song and maybe a little birthday dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-friendswood-2,2.216,2.216,2.216,2.216,2.216

The burgers and sides are mighty tasty as long as you're not counting calories. Bottomless sides are a nice touch, and it's good to see the brand has included other things than just fries to their selection.

Campfire Mayo served as a dipping sauce and was a nice touch to bring out the flavor of the appetizer.  I ordered the Burnin' Love, a burger that was cooked well done and quite spicy due to the jalapeño pepper that accompanied it alongside the fried peppers present in the burger itself. The burger was pretty good and was served alongside bottomless fries. However, the french fries were okay, nothing special in my opinion.  The entrees took awhile to come out though.

How do you have no one at your front door welcoming people in? When we were seated our booth had a horrible hanging light that gave us both headaches, it took the entire meal to get used to it. A table got seated behind us and they requested to move because it was so awful. This is definitely a place to ask for a table over a booth, so you don't have that light right over you.

3,A M.,"League City, TX",0,21,,2.0,2017-12-23,Took way too long to get our order. Enough to where our waiter apologized that he had to get the Manager on it but we never saw the manager come over. One waiter working on at least 5 tables with other staff members sitting around and just talking. Really wanted to like this place...MANAGEMENT YOU NEED TO STEP THIS UP!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-friendswood-2?start=20,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
30,Lynne W.,"Dallas, TX",47,9,,1.0,2018-01-02,Nothing gourmet about their burgers.  For that matter they do not even know how to cook one to order.  After having to send it back three times it finally came out pink in the middle.  But by that time my appetite had left me.  Garlic Parmesan Fries were soaked in oil and inedible.  Sad to see what was once a favorite go to disappear into the land of forgotten restaurants.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-friendswood-2,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32

23,Joseph S.,"Houston, TX",0,5,7.0,1.0,2018-01-09,"Was working on my birthday and signed up online for get a free burger(advise from Co-worker) on your birthday. Well I put the day instead of the month, so it says I have to wait until September... ugh  Ok I'll talk to someone there and they'll take care of it, right? WRONG. Showed the manager my license to prove my mistake and he said no because I could get a free burger in September. Been there several times for take out, but no longer. No Customer service skills by the manager. Didn't catch his name but looked Asian",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-friendswood-2,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36
