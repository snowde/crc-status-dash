49,Danielle M.,"Gainesville, FL",16,41,16.0,4.0,2013-03-20,"We attended the training lunch on 3/20 at around 12p. It was relatively busy and since we had reservations we did not wait but a few minutes for the staff to explain the ""free food stipulations"". Our wait time to get a server and place our drink order was about 15 minutes, hence why they got 4 stars, however, the rest of our experience was phenomenal! Our server, Adam H. was super nice and attentive and did a really great job of interacting with the four of us and making sure our orders came out perfectly. 3 different occasions someone random came by and picked up trash for us without disturbing our party and our drinks were kept full. I highly recommend the simply grilled chicken sandwich- i chose this because it has the least amount of calories and fat (375 and 6) compared to the ""healthy"" salads and turkey burger (1100-1300 calories including fries and close to 60g of grams of fat EEEK). My fiance' had the burnin  love buger which was NOT greasy and featured fried jalapenos YUM. Definintely recommend this Red Robin and so happy we finally have one!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-gainesville?start=60,2.9280000000000004,2.9280000000000004,2.9280000000000004,2.9280000000000004,2.928000000000001

I liked the fried jalapeños and fried mushrooms a lot. Their freckled lemonade is really good and is surprisingly with free refills. The server we had, Josh, was about as good as they get. I will say its not as cheap as you may expect, and the burgers are maybe a little smaller than I expected, but they are also really tasty and you can always add extra meat for like a dollar fifty I think. I am really looking forward to coming back to try something new because it all looked good. I think the fried mushrooms will be a staple here for me.

58,Colleen G.,"Gainesville, FL",23,18,,2.0,2013-04-30,"After my first experience there, I have to say that Red Robin isn't really ""Yummm!""   For years, I have seen these commercials on television and wondered what the fuss was about.  We finally got one in the Oaks Mall and I was eager to try it out.   We ordered and the waitress brought us our burgers just a few moments later.  I was amazed by how fast it was, but after inspecting the food, we realized that they brought it to the wrong table (I made a point to let the waitress know that I touched the burger so unsuspecting neighbors didn't get my germs).  This was a simple mistake, so I didn't think much of it.   The waitress asked if we wanted our burgers ""pink"" or ""done in the middle.""  I am usually a medium-well kind of gal, so I went with done.  I didn't realize that ""done"" really means ""charred.""  I felt bad because I ordered it that way, but even a well-done burger should have SOME kind of flavor other than burnt.   The steak fries were good and I liked the fact that they were unlimited.  Unfortunately you can only eat so many fries in one sitting.   I was also unhappy with the price.  My husband and I could have gotten double the food at Five Guys for the same cost and been much happier.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-gainesville?start=40,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006

The appetizer was just ok--definitely bought frozen and just fried in house. I ordered a burger (switched swiss cheese for cheddar) with sweet potato fries and my boyfriend a burger with steak fries. When our meal came out my burger came with steak fries. I mentioned it and the waiter said he would bring the correct fries out shortly. I took one bite of my burger and realized it had swiss cheese...I HATE swiss cheese. I sent it back, then my sweet potato fries came out, so they were getting cold while my burger was getting fixed. By the time my burger came out my boyfriend had finished eating. The whole meal was just ok and the confusion with the fries and the cheese really dampened the experience.

Burgers are one of my absolute most favorite foods, and Red Robin has some great burgers. Granted, they are a bit pricey, but well worth it. The couple times that I have been there, the servers were very friendly and the food was cooked to perfection. The only reason I took away one star was the price, which to be fair, I expected to be at that level. But with all you can eat fries, delicious burgers, and the strawberry lemonade with real strawberries, it was well worth it.

57,Adam G.,"Gainesville, FL",11,100,3.0,2.0,2013-06-23,"I too was pretty disappointed with Red Robin. I'll start off by saying that the service was excellent. I've been twice and both times, the waiters were very attentive and courteous. Unfortunately, that's about the only thing positive I can really say about Red Robin.  I've heard the burgers hyped by a lot of people from other areas and I simply don't understand it. They were not nearly as big as I had heard. Various types of burgers and different toppings that you can customize does not make this place ""gourmet"". The cooks seem to have a problem with undercooking. Guys... ""medium well"" does not mean bloody and raw, no matter how many times you cook it that way and we eat it instead of sending it back. In the end, the burgers really don't taste much different than Burger King, who I don't like. The only slight saving grace from making it taste exactly like BK was the toppings. At least the chili is pretty good and has a nice spice to it. The fries may be bottomless (though I was never asked if I wanted more), but they're just your average steak fries, nothing special.  Lastly, the price for alcohol is absolutely insane. $4 for a bottle of domestic? WTF is that? For that matter, the price for those burgers is too high as well.  Simply no motivation to ever go back to this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-gainesville?start=40,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006,2.6960000000000006

27,Chris K.,"Gainesville, FL",46,95,1193.0,2.0,2013-08-19,"I hadn't gotten around the trying Red Robin since I generally avoid the mall like the plague, but we were in the area before a movie over at Gators 4 Cinemas and decided to give it a try. The place was packed but we were able to get seated quickly in the bar area. Our waitress took our order quickly and kept the drinks refilled without us having to ask. So all of our interactions with their staff were positive.   The food however wasn't anything to write home about...I'm not even sure if it's really worth writing a review about either. Hamburgers are their thing, so you'd think they'd really pay attention to the quality of their beef. Unfortunately we found their beef to be under seasoned and rather bland tasting. Like Five Guys, Red Robin masks mediocre beef with tons of toppings. Since I get my burgers with very few toppings I pay attention to the flavor of the beef. We used their special house seasoning to try and give it some flavor, but that really didn't help a whole lot.    You'd get a better sandwich a couple doors over at Ruby Tuesday or over at BJ's. Red Robin is barely a step above fast food, but with the same prices as the aforementioned competition.  The atmosphere is like any other boring TGIF, Apple Bees, Chili's kind of American restaurant. They thew some random crap at the walls, put up screens to watch sports on, and serve boring food. The place is also rather loud, and not at all relaxing to eat at.  I'm not sure why, but I expected more.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-gainesville?start=20,2.8240000000000003,2.8240000000000003,2.8240000000000003,2.8240000000000003,2.8240000000000003

First impression I suppose was that its interior reminded me much of many other chain restaurants: lots of pop-culture photos and posters up on the walls, nice lighting, upbeat, friendly waitstaff. The emphasis is on burgers and they also seem to have a full bar and a variety of drink specials--much like Chili's or several other chain places I can think of do.  I ordered a burger that was covered with a teriyaki glaze and pineapple and cheese--Hawai'ian-inspired and much better than perhaps it sounds. Still, it seemed small and the fries that came with it were good but not really enough, either, for lunch. I also had their signature strawberry lemonade which was ok but not for $4, even with unlimited refills. I should have just ordered Coke instead. Like Burger-Fi out on Archer, the concept here is good and the food isn't bad but not exceptional, either. Just mediocre and pretty much what one would expect for a mall restaurant.

I know I'm a little nutrition conscious but if I can see the bottom of the basket, I think I would want more fries than what you gave me. Overall, everything was nice, but the prices would keep me from coming often. There are many other joints where you can get a double burger just as good for a bit lower.

It took about 7 minutes to get seated because all of the servers pointed the poor hostess to different tables so they couldn't take us and loudly argued about how they didn't want to take us. The hostess apologized and it took another 10 minutes for a server to come take our order. We offered to get a to-go order, but they told us it was okay.  The server complained profusely to us and the neighboring table about how terrible the day was and how they are closing early. I ordered the southern charm and I understand it was late, but I had the soggiest burger I've ever had. I don't even understand where the water came from, it was like they soaked the bottom bun in water. Hence the one star, a gourmet burger place should not have a soggy burger.

The service was slow, but the server was friendly. We got the chips and dip for an appetizer ... they were absolutely amazing, but were a really, really small serving size.

I mean really, that is like so last century. I had a burger, the sauce, ok, not great, completely soaked into the bun making it soggy. If they had toasted the bun, or put on less sauce, or here is a tip, put the sauce NEXT to the meat, and THEN put the lettuce on top to prevent soaking into the bun, that is what I do at home and it works great. Anyway, I really didn't need the carbs from the bun anyway, so cool, they helped me save a few hundred calories. The raspberry tea was really good, and the non-sugar variety, is only about 10 calories a glass. Also great way to save calories. All in all, it could have been better, but certainly could have been worse, like, for instance, if I had gone to McDonalds. Here is a tip if you end up here, you can probably pick up the Wi-Fi from the Oaks Mall. But the Wi-Fi name has nothing to do with Oaks, or any permutation thereof, it is TheClub I believe.

I noticed that the folks around me didn't have their food yet but didn't think too much of it until about a solid 45 minutes passed. When my burger finally came I out it was on bread instead of lettuce. Kinda disappointing as I've already waited so long. So tack on another 5 minutes and the situation was remedied. I could tell the bar tender/waiter felt badly as he'd been apologizing to several patrons about the delays and send backs to the kitchen.

The inside is nice, and the menu has a number of options for someone who can sometimes be picky. Prices also seem to be reasonable for what you get. I ordered the Royal Red Robin and their Freckled Lemonade, which is basically just a lemonade with strawberry syrup and some sliced strawberries on top. Nice, but it is something that I would only order once in a blue moon... I am now done with strawberries for a while.  The burger was quite good, and they got the egg right (the yolk should be runny. You want it to come out as a liquid so that it creates its own sauce on the burger!) The fries that came with the burger are also decent. Service was fair. Our server had to come and help us with their payment system a number of times because it only sort of work properly.  In town here, I would go back from time to time.

4,J D.,"Jacksonville, FL",5,52,17.0,4.0,2017-05-06,"I had the Teriyaki chicken sandwich.It was delicious. It has grilled chicken breast, pineapple, lettuce, cheese, tomato(I had it sans tomato), mayo and of course the teriyaki sauce. Along with the sandwich I had the signature bottomless seasoned fries. The ice tea was so-so. It was a little on the watery side. The service was okay, nothing particularly outstanding. The guy was helpful, but I guess he had too many tables scattered about the place to be more attentive. I was glad to see that there is one finally coming to Jacksonville, at Town Center Drive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-gainesville,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006

He identified the server who was supposed to come over to tend to us, but after another 13 minutes of where no one has come to us. We never saw our server.

5,Michael M.,"Jacksonville, FL",46,63,223.0,5.0,2017-06-11,"The hostess staff set the pleasant tone for this visit. My friend and I were seated immediately and it was a pretty occupied dining area.  Gabriel, our waiter, introduced himself and asked if it was our first visit here. He oriented the establishment and the menu items. He asked about rewards familiarity and spoke about getting it started. He answered our questions about quality, wait time, content and menu suggestions with enthusiasm and knowledge. In under 10 minutes our selections were served once I returned from their ""sanitary"" men's room, and the Marco Polo and Bees Knees were hot, flavorful and delish!  Gabriel checked back with a different approach each time that was not mechanical or disingenuous. He was the same with each table that I could overhear.  The experience all encompassed was superior!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-gainesville,3.4,3.4,3.4,,3.4000000000000004
11,Kurt K.,"Doral, FL",71,201,339.0,3.0,2017-08-19,"So it's the first week of school.  Lots of parents in town and can you believe it they got hit hard at opening. Short staff. Family had gone in while I parked. Hostess said I could just wander around looking even after I described who I was looking for. Really just wander around.? Chris the manager said they stagger their staff. Makes sense during the summer but not this particular weekend. Sat us then two other groups. Can you guess who got drink orders and appetizers way before us? Everyone. Had to ask for a server. Ordered apps and drinks and some fries with chipotle dipping sauce. The drinks came out. The guacamole and salsa was a small portion for 7 bucks. Maybe two ounces of each. Chips were good but not enough of the guac and salsa. Still no fries. Asked about the food and had a great view of the pass. Food was dying. Fortunately the female manager rolled in and started expediting. Food showed up, still no fries we ordered when we sat down, and no dipping sauce. My sandwich and the two burgers were good and hot. However I got 7 yes 7 fries with my sandwich. As did my son. The wife had twice as many. Manager finally brought fries then our waiter did. Guess they wanted us to get our fries. Birthday Sunday must of sat too since the whip cream was pretty wilted. Tim our waiter was obviously overwhelmed. We were his fourth or fifth table for him to serve. Again short staffed. Not sure it will be worth the drive again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-gainesville,3.32,3.32,3.32,,3.3200000000000003

I've had their salads, Chicken sandwiches (have order with a traditional bun as well as wrapped in lettuce) and all have been really good. This is a great place to bring kids. The staff interacts with and is friendly to them, it's loud enough to where they aren't going to bother anyone else and their kids meals are not just prepared Kraft Macaroni.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-gainesville,3.36,3.36,3.36,,3.3600000000000003

And who can resist unlimited fries.  Yes please keep em coming.  A manager even stopped by the table to see how everything was.  What is this kind of sorcery?  Hardly anyplace does this anymore.  Thank you Red Robin.  We will def be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-gainesville,3.44,3.44,3.44,,3.4400000000000004
