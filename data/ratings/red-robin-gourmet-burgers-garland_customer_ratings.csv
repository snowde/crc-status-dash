83,Daniel S.,"Dallas, TX",22,144,6.0,3.0,2012-04-13,"Pros: * Burger (Mushroom swiss burger) tasted good & was cooked how I ordered it (medium well) * Bottomless french fries when you buy a burger or sandwich! Cons: * Expensive (cheapest burger or sandwich is $7.99, that's about $12 after tax and tip without a drink, appetizer, or dessert) * While the fries are bottomless, they're nothing special, just average steak fries. Also, I don't know if this is a ""rule"" but when I went with a friend and we both ordered burgers they would only bring out a small individual portion for both of us to share, it seemed to take 5, 10, or more minutes to get a refill of fries. * The bottom bun of my burger was soggy 2-3 minutes after I got it, I'm not sure if it was because of the mushrooms or the burger itself. * While the price says this is a sit-down nicer restaurant (like Chili's), the atmosphere doesn't seem that way. The place is very busy, noisy, the booths are small-ish, and there isn't even any napkins at the table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-garland?start=80,3.2760000000000007,3.2760000000000007,3.2760000000000007,3.2760000000000007,3.276000000000001
106,Shams B.,"Richardson, TX",65,513,80.0,5.0,2012-06-24,"Is is more expensive to grab a burger here than say McDonald's, Chili's,etc? Yes. Are they as good? That's subjective, some of you will think they are, some of you will think they're not.  What sets this place apart from any other burger joint is unlimited steak fries, and boy are they full of hot crispy goodness. I've never had an issue waiting to get more fries unless they've been slammed, but that's 100% understandable.

What this means is the steak fries with garlic parmeasean, Bowl of chili greatness, great burgers all combine to bring a fusion of great items on the menu for a success. True some times I think the fries are overly addicting and more appeasing than the burger but honestly, who can turn down a great american burger with awesome fries?

64,Bruce C.,"Richardson, TX",372,609,245.0,4.0,2012-12-18,"It's been some time since we came back here, but, as always, they never disappoint.  This particular Saturday, we arrived and the parking lot was packed.  We walked in to find a bunch of junior high school girls with ribbons in their hair and their makeup done as if they dialed their make-up machine to whore.  Yes, a cheerleading competition was going on nearby and apparently everyone was directed to Red Robin afterwards. The wife approaches the podium and asks how long the wait will be, and surprisingly, the hostess replies with ""10 minutes.""  Not too bad.  I was getting ready to go somewhere else to eat, but we can manage 10 minutes. We get seated quickly and our waiter comes up to us and says, ""Hi guys, welcome to Red Robin, my name is Fabio and I'll be your waiter today.""  I notice his name tag says Rudolph.  Me: ""Um...  Okay, you said your name is Fabio, but your name tag says Rudolph.  What's up with that?"" Fabio: ""Well, I was wearing a red nose and antlers earlier, but without them, people would think I'm weird"" Me: ""Your name could actually be Rudolph..."" Fabio: ""Yes, but who's parents would name their kid Rudolph?"" Yes... yes indeed, Fabio.... Onto the food! I get my go-to burger, the Burnin' Love burger.  I like trying their new burgers, and this was one of them 3 years ago.  Since then, I get this burger about 50% of the time.  It's a regular burger with pepper jack cheese, deep fried jalapeno slices, mild/medium salsa and all the regular stuff.  It's really good if you like burgers with a kick.  It's not that spicy.  Probably a 3 on a scale of 1-10.  As with all their food, if you don't like it, they'll make you a different one free of charge. The wife gets the Petite Bonzai.  A teriyaki burger with cheddar cheese, and a pineapple slice with all the fixins.  She loves it and up until she tried the Mushroom Swiss, she ate this one exclusively.  The petite burger is just a smaller burger that's $1 cheaper. Since there were so many people in the restaurant, the fries were piping hot as they should be.  The Wife's petite Bonzai was delicious she tells me.  I don't like pineapple on anything but dessert foods, so I have never tried it. Other than that, our service was good, the food was good and our experience was as good as our other experiences here.   Thanks again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-garland?start=60,3.84,3.84,3.84,3.248,3.84

Thankfully, the manager came out and admitted the error and made his apologies. Glad that our server was accommodating on my broccoli refills (I opted for unlimited veggies instead of the bottomless fries), but my biz partner noted an odd fishy taste in his broc--probably because it was previously frozen.

73,Fanta B.,"Wylie, TX",53,90,1.0,5.0,2014-04-10,"I've been to plenty so-so locations of Red Robins.  Not surprisingly (maybe), is that most of the bad locations are in malls.  I suspect because indoor malls are dying and the clientele isn't great there, and thus, food and service quality suffer. I have found, by in large, this Red Robin to be great.  Hardly ever a wait for a table (unless you show up right after an event just ended at one of the nearby gymnastics places), great service, and great food.  There have been a few times where I had to wait a while to get my extra serving of fries, but that was the exception, not the norm. I think the burgers at Red Robin (here and generally) are pretty good, but really we come for the steak fries.  You could go cheap and get the smaller ""Red's Tavern Double"" and just stuff yourself with fries.  As long as you tip well (and you should, I overtip like crazy compared to most, but I appreciate good service), you only end up paying a few dollars more than some other counter-service burger joints. My wife and I come here A LOT these days (like 1-2 times a week), so we have had many, many servers help us.  Several stand out though for fantastic service, and well, not gonna lie, they are really friendly and really cute too: Aurora, Amelia, Amy, and Heather.  Red Robin is not exactly the place you can request a particular server, but if you get into sections with these servers, you're good to go.

One of the things that has impressed me about this location is that they have at least two servers who have been there for 3+ years. There is a Chilis in Casa Linda that I have patronized for 20+ years with about the same frequency and I have never seen the same server twice. Ever. And even though I only come in 3-4 times a year, those RR servers remember me!  RR has pretty good burgers for the prices, and since I now have a teen with a hollow leg to fill, the bottomless fries make it a particularly good deal. They have always been accomodating to wishes for a different cheese, add or subtract toppings, etc. I prefer ranch to ketchup, and unlike Chilis, RR does not charge extra for this sauce.  Sodas are a little expensive, but I somehow raised a kid who prefers lemonade to sodas and water to lemonade! I can usually feed the two of us for $20 plus tip. Pricier than fast food but not too bad for a sit down restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-garland?start=100,3.56,3.56,3.56,3.088,3.5600000000000005

I'm basing this review on numerous prior experiences since we didn't eat on this visit and the fact that if you charge premium prices you should have premium service. This place used to be good. We used to go there every Wednesday night before going grocery shopping and get seated in our favorite waitresses section. She's long gone and we don't go as often as we used to and now I remember why. We Arrived yesterday (Friday) a little after 8:00pm and to our surprise it was busting out the door with people. We usually sit at the bar when it's busy but this time the bar was also full. The only non-wait table was this little Popsicle-stick looking bar height behind the bar seats so we sat down. There were also 3 clean tables in the bar area that were empty. So we sit, and we wait, and we watch at least 10 wait staff and a manager walk by us without even acknowledging us. The bartenders can see us and they ignore us as well. I guess this table isn't in anyone's section. We ended up waiting for 10 minutes before we walk out and go down to check out the newly remodeled Wendy's. To the Management: Get rid of your current group of hostesses and find someone who knows what they're doing. Or maybe make all seating in the bar first come first served.

My order isn't completely different, it's just another burger on the menu so I'll eat it because I love burgers and I always order burgers there.  The waiters and waitresses aren't the best, they're not very attentive to you, and if you want your order of bottomless fries you gotta ask for it, multiple times before they give it to you. Last time I went there our waiter was EXTREMELY flirtatious, to the point it was very uncomfortable that I couldn't give him eye contact because I was just VERY uncomfortable to look at him. He was attractive and I could tell he'd flirt for bigger tips, but dude, too much. I felt like I was being freaking smothered by you.  Overall it's an OKAY area, they get your order wrong and they should better train their waiters/waitresses and there's usually a long-ish wait for you to be seated, but the food is really good and have fun decor in there.

15,Amanda S.,"Dallas, TX",507,175,133.0,5.0,2017-05-25,"Holy smokes! This place was packed for a Wednesday night! I'm not sure if it's the area, or because of graduations, but everyone in Garland was here with there moms ;-) including myself and my mom and her mom, haha. Anyways, my family and I decided to meet up here on the fly because my little brother was raving about their fries. There was 8 of us, and we were seated within 30 minutes. They put us at a booth which was odd, and we were a tad crammed but hey what says I love you better than elbowing your neighbor right? Real bonding experience. On the real though, service was ridiculously fast, our server never let our drinks get half full ;-P  and she knew the menu very well. They have a crazy amount of different burgers, I tried the burnin love, a bunch of spiciness on a bun, it was super yummy! Their fries are good too, bottomless, not that anyone could really eat a large amount of them anyways (their burgers themselves are huge) and they have fry seasoning on the table. And they do have veggie options as well (shout out to my mom meat eaters out there). I don't know why I said that. Have a great day everyone!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-garland,3.84,3.51,3.51,,3.642

13,Carmelita C.,"Rowlett, TX",147,23,38.0,5.0,2017-06-24,"Red Robin was suggested by the other family we were grabbing lunch with and we loved it. My husband got the Burnnin Love Burger and I got the Turkey Burger. Both delicious and bottomless fries!! Yes you heard it,  bottomless fries!! I also want to say that if you are a sauce person like me then try all their delicious sauces. My favorite is the Camp Fire Sauce! For desert we had a cookies n cream milk shake it was so tasty!! Try this Red Robbin it's a great place to go for a reasonable price and most importantly delicious food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-garland,3.92,3.53,3.53,,3.686
22,Joselyn G.,"Richardson, TX",47,20,24.0,4.0,2017-07-09,This review is based on their vegan options. I have been able to get a better vegan meal from Red Robin than I have at vegan restaurants. The veggie burger with a whole wheat bun and veggie toppings is vegan. It is really good and so filling. The fries are vegan as well. The waitress we had was careful to not give us egg or dairy in anything we ordered. A good place to go with non-Vegans.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-garland?start=20,4.04,3.53,3.53,,3.734

21,Joyce W.,"Richardson, TX",1,57,13.0,2.0,2017-07-15,"Crowded, noisy.  We went there because of memories of delicious burgers and endless fries from 5 yrs ago.  Yummy!   Ordered drinks.  Then burgers and fries.  Waited a good 20-25 minutes for burgers.  We thought we remembered last time getting fries immediately to asuage our appetites til burgers arrived.  But, no fries til burgers arrive and only medium serving of fries.  Asked for more immediately!  Yes, fries were gone before more came.  And she never ask if we wanted more drinks til our meal was over!   Admittedly the burgers and fries were good though my grilled salmon slid out of my bun like a fish trying to escape.  I'm not in a hurry to go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-garland?start=20,3.88,3.53,3.53,,3.67
6,Ritz L.,"Plano, TX",97,196,259.0,3.0,2017-08-25,"While my husband was out visiting his folks in San Diego, CA, his parents took him to Red Robin out there and he swore it was the best food he's ever had burgerwise and it's gotten so much better since the late 90's, so I agreed to try it. When we got there, we got seated right away and the server came to take our drink order. It was very quick and the place was pretty packed. I looked over the menu to find that there were so many items I had a hard time deciding. I don't eat meat, but I eat some fish/shellfish and there were salmon dishes on there. Then, I saw ""VooDoo Fries"" with Bacon, Jalapeño, cheese with Ghost Pepper sauce and Ranch sauce, so I ordered it(Bacon on the side for my husband). I also ordered Peach unsweetened ice tea(it was sweetened, but it's ok)and veggie burger. This place gives out all you can eat fries, but of course I didn't need seconds as that's way too much food. The veggie burger was very delicious with fresh slices of avocado. However, I must say that I was disappointed in ""VooDoo Fries"". It's more like ""BooBoo Fries"", because they forgot to put the jalapeños and the cheese was like velveeta/nachos cheese texture and quality and the ghost pepper was more like Louisiana hot sauce degree of spiciness which is nothing. Over all, it wasn't nothing spectacular, so don't order it. If I'd known that, I wouldn't had ordered it. That's the only concern I had and like I said, my veggie burger was great though I couldn't eat it all. I took the rest of the fries(steak cut fries)and the veggie burger to my doggie children and they ate every crumb of it. I was too full, I had no room for dessert. Maybe, next time for sure. My dining experience was a good one. I will definitely return again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-garland,3.8,3.55,3.55,,3.65

5,Iris A.,"Dallas, TX",4,32,52.0,1.0,2017-09-16,"As this was my first ever visit to RR, I was pretty excited. The place was packed but the atmosphere was pretty good. The sandwich look very generous with size; the sesame seed bun didn't even bother me. It was love upon first bite , soooo much flavor! ...But for the rest of the bites not so much. The breading kind of divorced the meat, then the meat divorced the bread and I'm now I'm stuck with what looks like pieces of a food puzzle that I really don't feel like putting back together. As Red Robin is a well known burger staple, the problem with these burger staples is that since chicken sandwiches are just thrown on the menu to make it universal; chicken sandwiches are always second to beefy patties; the power to carefully craft the perfect chicken sandwich will always go un-honed. Why did the chicken cross the road? The cows took up all the space.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-garland,3.88,3.53,3.53,,3.67
9,Crystal P.,"Coppell, TX",43,77,33.0,3.0,2017-09-17,"I love going to Red Robin because of the unlimited steak fries but this particular location always seems a bit slow about getting your burger out to you in timely manner. If it weren't for our Waiter, Nathan, I'd probably have given it a 2 Star rating today. Nathan went above and beyond by bringing us steak fries to hold us over until our burgers came out. We're use to this location being slow but never THIS slow. Nathan was on top of it and made sure we were taken care of ...even when they brought only 2 of our 4 orders out he asked where the other 2 were and promptly got them for us. I honestly can't say enough about how pleased I was with our Server. I'm guessing the hold up was whomever was on burgers because when we asked for more fries they were ready really fast. The food is always good as long as you don't mind the long wait after you've ordered. I know that, that's the biggest reason we don't come here as often as we could.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-garland,3.84,3.52,3.52,,3.648
3,Chris G.,"Richardson, TX",50,21,1.0,3.0,2017-09-17,"Let me begin by saying our waiter Nathan was awesome!  He in NO WAY caused me to give this visit three stars.  Nathan's performance was a solid five stars.   My issue is with the speed at which we received our food.  There were four of us and we ordered two burgers with fries, the grilled cheese with fries and a salad.  To be honest, I always expect the speed at which we get our food to be a little slow.  It always seems to be that way, but this afternoon was especially slow.  Nathan was even concerned with the speed of the food and he went above and beyond and brought us out an order of fries to munch on while we waited on our main courses.   Once we received our food, the speed of getting our fries refilled was very fast.  Whoever was in charge of making sure the fries were readily available was on the ball.  Those in charge of the burgers and other menu items, not so much. This will not stop us from eating here from time to time, but we may stay away during the busier times to avoid the slow service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-garland,3.8,3.52,3.52,,3.632
2,Isela V.,"Garland, TX",171,261,57.0,3.0,2017-09-28,"Went in for my Bday Rewards burger.  Their service is always consistently friendly and uneventful.  The fact that you can pay for your order at the table and not have to wait for the check or on a waiter reduces your wait time. Can't say I've had their food, other than a variety of burgers.  For the most part, they are cooked to order and their ingredients seem pretty fresh tasting.  You can get a side of fries, sweet potatoes or onion rings.  All of which I recommend.  They serve a variety of local and state beers to pair with your food.  They even have beer flights for your convenience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-garland,3.76,3.51,3.51,,3.61

Make matters worse; tell manager and they could careless.   That is the real cherry that pisses you off!!!   Drive almost two hours to come here to be rushed and ignored.   Screw this place!
