Prices seemed fair and included bottomless drinks and fries.

45,L B.,"Clayton, NC",110,7,6.0,3.0,2016-05-26,"Love Red Robin, this location is different. Food was great, staff was great, but tables are so packed in it's ridiculous. Much different from other RR's in the area. Tables so close the servers had to turn sideways to squeeze through, lifting trays of food over our heads as well as the bus boys lifting dish carriers over our heads. Not cool Red Robin, whoever designed this new layout gets an F. Very hard to get to rest rooms having to negotiate high chairs, big pocketbooks hanging on chairs and walkers. Tables so close I got all the details of my neighboring tables medical procedures whether I wanted to hear them or not. I really felt sorry for the servers. Not cool when they are trying to deliver food to a neighboring table and their butt is in your face. Only a 10 minute wait, wasn't as crowded as we thought it would be but plenty of patrons for the size of the dining rooms.

First, the hostess wouldn't let us sit at a 4 top table, wanting to ""reserve"" it for a larger party should one come in. That would have been fine if it hadn't been half empty in there. In fact for the first hour that we were there no one sat there at all. Then the hostess sat another couple there after that hour had passed. In the meantime we were placed at a small 2 top table that we barely fit into. In all fairness though,  our server was absolutely great and we loved her. Then our food came. I ordered the fruit for my side. It was awful. The condition that it was in would be the point I would throw it away if it were in my fridge. Complete mush.

It seemed like they called out some names, but not ours. I happened to look and saw I had received a text that they were ready. Weird when we were standing right there!  The food was great as usual. They have that down. Servers were very friendly and attentive. The kids' food came out quickly, which we did appreciate. Husband and I waited a good 20 minutes more for ours.

9,Edward W.,"Garner, NC",8,8,,4.0,2016-07-16,"First time at this location. There were both bad and good.  The bad: Like others had said, the restaurant has a small footprint.  We were lucky enough to get a booth, but I'm pretty sure if we were placed in an inner table, we would've gotten claustrophobic to the point of panic.   But the good outweighed:  The staff were friendly and prepared.  The food was good.  Our drinks were kept full and we were offered extra fries without having to ask. On that last note.  Eating out for my family can be a little bit of a challenge.  My wife is a vegetarian and my daughters are vegans, both by choice and because of allergies.  Our waitress, Victoria, handled our special orders efficiently and cheerfully.  (And the back line had it all right!)  Then when offering extra fries, Victoria did remember the need for a basket to not have the seasoning on it.  This is a first of the many times we've been to RR through the years.

7,Jenny B.,"Angier, NC",10,10,3.0,2.0,2016-07-21,"I waited 24 hrs to calm down to write this so here it goes. First walking in we were seated and our waitress came promptly. Asked about our drinks. My mom and I both wanted something w a kick so we told her we weren't ready. She goes well I can get you soda or water or ice tea. None did we really want, but figuring she needed something to do. So we said water. She comes back puts them down ask if we were ready for our drink order ect. This process repeated every 2 mins. We felt hounded. We finally (after sharing a drink menu) decided what we wanted and placed that order. After that it's what do you want to eat, this started a 2 min return to table. Ugggg finally w a very large selection being our first time here decided. Placed our order I said ""NO pink I'd rather them burn it then it be pink."" It comes back the food runner brings out silverware and napkins since we had NONE at this point. ( she actually noticed and just did this wo asking I was impressed by her!) I cut my burger at first it looked fine after a few bites there was pink lots of pink to me. I called our waitress over she says "" I can take that half ( the half I hadn't touched) and have them put it on the grill for you will that be ok or do you want a manager."" Ummmm manger please. Manger came over took my plate and rung up another burger for me came back perfect and was very good. We finished our meal ordered desert to go which the brownie stick things are amazing btw. However walking out I was notified I was charged for both burgers yep both and they can remove it from my card but would be a 3-5 days.  So to me the food was good was it worth the price no not really my burger was 14$ ( each lol) and I just don't see the hype for that.  My drink was watered down and my moms was over kill they are not measuring the liquor correctly for the mixes.  The brownie sticks are worth the price and worth the Calories lol amazing these little things lol.  Service was way below expectations Waffle House waiters can out do our waiter any day. For what is suppose to be a slightly upper class environment I expected better. Bar and wait staff could take lessons at TGI Fridays. As for the management staff by the point you realize that A my order wasn't cooked rt, my new order came out when my mom was done eating AND I was over charged sorry but by that point to me both burgers should of come off my tab not just the one that was messed up. It's all little things yes but it ruined my first visit and I can say our next girls day when we are like umm where should we go, red robin won't be on the list! Very disappointed!

49,Christopher K.,"Fuquay Varina, NC",0,3,,1.0,2016-07-30,"Today I went to Red Robin in Garner, NC and it was one of the worst experiences I have had at any restaurant. To begin with our server Rhonda asked for our drink orders and did not return with them for 10 minutes.  Upon returning someone in my party asked her a simple question about the mac-and-cheese sides and she responded by yelling at him.  After our food was ordered the waitress did not return to the table for about 5 minutes and she brought the sides of fries.  We did not see her again for at least 20 minutes to check up on us. After another 20 minutes our food came out.  When we began inspecting out food to make sure it was what we ordered, my friend found his order to be incorrect. He asked her to take it back and get the cooks to remake the food.  She returned very quickly with the same burger on a different bun with the condiments just wiped off. He asked to see a manager and we did not see her for around 10 minutes. After speaking to the manager and getting the order processed correctly the food that was incorrect was left at the table.  Once the correct meal was brought back to the table it was fine. However this was one of the worst experiences I have had at a restaurant. The waitress was very inconsistent in managing our table, the manager was not very friendly, and the quality of the service was just lacking in general.

She brought the water and said she would check on us in 2 minutes.  My burger was well done and my fries were cold.  We had to hit the alert button on the Kiosk because we never saw the waitress again.  After I finished eating she came by and I told her about my burger.  The manager later came by and did comp my burger.  I told him about the waitress and length of time to get our meal.  I never saw the waitress again had to pay using the Kiosk.  I will never eat there again hope this is not a reflection on all Red Robbin Restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-garner?start=40,2.64,2.64,2.64,2.436,2.64

Server was extremely friendly, almost too friendly, and upon inquiry (which I am oft to do due to a lack of shame) I found out she was extremely tired so she was trying to make up for it.  Once she felt at ease things were good until the end.

In summary I take it back you'd prolly have to wait to take a dump here and they'd be out of TP.  ITS A NO FOR ME.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-garner,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
29,Karissa O.,"Stockton, CA",4,16,1.0,5.0,2017-03-11,"Generally good service, from what I would expect from a newly established Red Robin. Our waiter was cool, lol she had to yell at the kitchen cause they left the onion & tomatoes on my burger but no biggie, I'm not allergic & I can just take them off. My room mates seemed satisfied with their food & they got Sweet potato fries for their sides. I had the wedgie burger & a side of Broccoli for my Keto diet. Food was as good as I expected it to be for Red Robin. May go back again when its convenient.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-garner,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
28,Liann K.,"Raleigh, NC",21,74,29.0,4.0,2017-03-19,"We are here when it first opened and had a horrible experience. However, we decided some months later to give it another shot, figuring that it was probably just growing pains. We were pleasantly surprised by the improvement in service and food quality. Only complaint is someone was blowing up balloons or doing something that caused a very loud rushing sound (not a blender) the entire time we were eating, and it was distracting and annoying. But the food was great!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-garner,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56

I was super happy to  know we had a closer location so I didn't have to drive to the Cary or Brier Creek locations, but needless to say I won't be going back.  Both times,we had no wait so no complaints there, but both times food was cold. It was 3 in my party so I understand why my burger was cold.. not even luke warm. 1st time, shame on you, 2nd time, shame on me.. There won't be a 3rd time. Hope you have a better experience.

34,Remy R.,"Paris, France",0,14,,2.0,2017-03-30,"We love love Red Robin as a franchise / chain, but this can't be a real Red Robin! Seriously folks, the food here is simply horrible. I don't know why or what is going on here. Everything is always cold and the buns for the burgers are always stale. French fries are soggy and also cold. I'm personally a huge fan of french onion soup, but DO NOT get it here. One again cold and they just can't seem to figure out the appropriate amount of broth vs the onions and bread. The only reason I'm giving this Red Robin a 2 star instead of a 1 is because we always try places 3 times before we throw in the towel and the wait staff seemed to improve each time we made a visit, but that's not saying a lot. Red Robin fans, steer clear of this location!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-garner,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
26,Mario K.,"Garner, NC",59,125,147.0,4.0,2017-04-24,"Ate here last week and was surprised at the low reviews. It is a major chain restaurant, so I'm rating it as such. Our waitress was fantastic, super attentive, checked on us just the right amount of time. Overwhelmed with a pretty massive menu, she had our drinks to us within five minutes and got us started with a basket of tasty fries. Both of our burgers arrived quickly, were cooked as ordered, and were quite good. Considering the alternatives in the area, I would say this Red Robin location is one of the better local choices. I have no concern recommending it as a solid burger place with just enough choices of other options, cocktails, beers on tap, sides and delicious looking deserts.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-garner,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
25,Carissa W.,"Raleigh, NC",172,27,11.0,5.0,2017-05-09,"SHORT STORY: I was really impressed with the way Red Robin turned my frown upside down! I was dissatisfied with my milkshake and when I told Brandon about it, he was compassionate and understanding (when I expected excuses and defensiveness). He immediately took steps to make sure it didn't happen again (training opportunity) and FedEx'd me a gift certificate to come try again - to give them a chance to make it right. LONG STORY: It's a silly thing, really. I drove out of my way to go to the Garner Red Robin to get a Salted Carmel Milkshake fix. I had one a week or two prior at a different RR store and couldn't get it out of my head. I took it to go and as soon as I was on the road, I was ready for the first amazing sip of gooey caramel and crunchy salt! Unfortunately, said gooey caramel and crunchy salt never happened. It tasted like a slightly sweetened plain-Jane vanilla milkshake. Boo! I had asked for the bartender to put chocolate sauce on top. I kind of thought it would be chocolate AND caramel...but I didn't specify so I wasn't worried about it. Because I paused to evaluate my topping, I did notice that there was something that looked like a shake of table salt on the top of the whipped cream... so she TRIED...but... it wasn't what I experienced the week prior. While I was waiting for my shake, I heard the bartender talking to another waitress about being sick...maybe getting over it... I don't remember...but I thought ""maybe she's not feeling her best, poor thing."" Sooooo, I thought to myself, maaaaaaybe that's the reason for the milkshake mishap. I tried to ""shake"" my feeling of dissatisfaction, but after a couple sips, I realized that I wasn't going to drink the milkshake... I didn't like it at all. I felt resentment bubbling up in me and thought about going back...but then I was on a highway headed in the opposite direction and opted not to turn around. Because I have a long history of appreciation for Red Robin and their many varieties of unique appetizers, sandwiches, and drinks, I decided that it was not a relationship that I wanted to end without at least conversing with them. I called and asked for a manager - Brandon came on the line and, as stated above, was super professional and attentive. He apologized and appreciated that I gave him the opportunity to make it right. (I didn't actually WANT anything - just to let him know - but he made it possible for me to come back and try again.)  Brandon C. single-handedly saved my relationship with Red Robin and I'm forever grateful!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-garner,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56

Parking lot was empty,  people waiting to be seated, was told it would be 15-20 minutes for a table. What!? There were empty tables everywhere bar was empty, decided maybe we could wait,  went in to the bar area till our table was ready. The lady bartender said we could sit at the tables in there and we had to be seated to sit in there too. Again, place was empty and we just wanted to wait. After that cancelled our wait and left. The bartender was rude. That restaurant is not worth the time. If you cant seat 3 people for a cheeseburger at this time of year you then you should be open in the first place.

21,Jennifer C.,"Durham, NC",114,1,,1.0,2017-12-02,"I had the worst experience of my life at Red Robin today- bad enough that I'm making my first yelp review of all time. I went to RR alone with the plan of meeting up with some friends there in about an hour. I asked the bartender to put on any of the relevant football games (conf championships) and was told that they don't get ABC or FOX. So I had to watch a 2014 replay MLB game. Another server came when the bartender was gone and put on FOX for me, which was great. When the bartender returned, she changed the channel away.   Listen, I know RR isn't a sports bar. But that type of blatant, passive aggressive behavior has no place in the service industry. I frequented that RR several times a month since the opening, but will take my business elsewhere from now on. Good luck making a profit when people figure out just how little you value your customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-garner,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92
