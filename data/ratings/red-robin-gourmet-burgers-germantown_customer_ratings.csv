This particular location will almost never give you a burger cooked rarer than medium well. Not sure if this is a policy or if the cooks just can't get it right. If you go in during September/October skip the Oktoberfest Burger. I found it underwhelming, stick with the classics on the menu. The pretzel bun was dry and the German mustard was barely evident and tasteless.

168,Dustin F.,"Rougemont, NC",2,15,,2.0,2012-11-12,"I've been to Red Robin several times before, including this location one other time. It was always good until today. I decided to take advantage of their Veterans Day special. I don't know if the staff needs to be trained or the company in general needs to take a note from other chains' playbooks. I was treated like I was using a coupon--not that people using coupons should ever be treated poorly, but it wasn't like I was being thanked for my service. I realize that may sound kind of self-entitled, especially for a guy like me who just did eight years like any other job, but... Well, the words ""thanks for your service"" or some reasonable facsimile should be said. That's kind of the point, right? It's not like vets really do it for the $6.99 off an order. Beyond the general lack of feeling behind it, the deal was a little lackluster as well. You're limited to just the tavern double cheeseburger (which, being kind of thin, I guess only comes at one temp? I wasn't asked how I liked it, so I assume that's the case). That's fine, except you can't even pay extra to choose one of the different styles. Actually, I take that back. Red Robin's website says you can. The server just told me that they couldn't. That kind of makes it worse. First, the appetizer we ordered, pretzel bites, had the texture of frozen, store-bought pretzels. Not bad, but kind of chewy and not all that great.  When our food finally arrived, it was cold. Not room temperature cold, but like it'd been sitting in the pass for five minutes or so. I pointed this out to the server, who told the manager. To be fair, the manager offered to remake the burgers. But it wasn't that it was inedible, just that it wasn't good (kind of bland, kind of mushy, fully congealed cheese, that kind of thing). And I don't like sending food back unless I absolutely have to. The manager apologized. He said, ""We'll make it up to you. I'll start by bringing you some fresh fries."" Keep in mind, the tavern double comes with bottomless fries. But since the fries we'd got were colder than the burgers and almost inedible, I wasn't going to argue. When the fries came out, they were piping hot. That was good, but considering how long they remained hot, it really made me wonder how long my food was sitting on the pass. It was also the last we saw of the manager or heard anything about making up for the cold food. Normally, I'd chalk it up to getting what you paid for. I also acknowledge that when we insisted on a different table (the first one we sat at was like being in a wind tunnel), we probably threw things off a little. However, with the app, drinks, and other orders, I really didn't feel like it was worth going there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-germantown?start=160,2.024,2.024,2.024,2.024,2.024

We also had to practically beg for silverware/napkins.  No one seemed to notice until after our food was served. The general service was slower than my liking (maybe because I just needed the experience to end).   All in all, I was surprised by the cleanliness of this restaurant.  I realize that Monday nights may feature the novice serving staff.

142,Mark H.,"Germantown, MD",16,20,11.0,2.0,2014-01-17,"Man, what happened to this chain?  I mean, I doubt anyone ever went to Red Robin expecting fine dining but the chain has always had huge burgers and good food.    We decided to stop at Red Robin while out shopping during the holiday season at around noon on a Saturday because it was literally the only place we could find that didn't have a huge line.  We were seated promptly and greeted quickly by our server.  I ordered a beer and my girlfriend ordered a strawberry lemonade.  My beer was delivered about 10 minutes later but no sign of the lemonade.  After asking about it, it showed up about 10 minutes after that with an apology from the server. We ordered our food.  I decided on the Peppercorn burger and some onion rings.  30 minutes later, our food had not arrived.  I had another beer (because of course I did) and we waited.  We weren't in a hurry but we were both hungry.  Eventually, the food showed up and man, what a let-down.  I ordered my burger medium rare and it came out well done without a trace of pink.  It was pretty clear why these burgers were easy to overcook.  It seems that since I visited Red Robin last, the chain made a decision to cut costs by switching from their big gourmet burgers to paper thin, flavorless burgers one would expect to see at a drive-thru fast food joint.  I showed the server and she did offer to recook it but I figured it really wouldn't matter much since the burger really wasn't thick enough to cook properly anyway.   The onion rings were good but to be frank, it's pretty hard to screw up onion rings. We finished our meal and left.  The server discounted our check without us even having to ask which was nice.  The two stars above are for the server making the best out of a bad situation.   Red Robin is not overly pricey, but it's too expensive for what basically amounts to fast food.  We won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-germantown?start=140,2.36,2.36,2.36,2.088,2.36

Also had the Pear- tini which was nothing but juice. Last but not least one of the favorite things we get at RR is the onion rings, which were fried too long to the point where it cut the roof of your mouth.

After telling my buddies about the bottomless fries, I knew this was going to be our Saturday lunch. :) We were greeted right away and taken to a table for four. Vanessa came took our drink order while we were waiting for 2 more to join us. As I was hungry and love to eat, I ordered a tower of onion rings and pretzel bites. Neither disappointed. The onions were fried perfectly and came with a dish of ranch and a creamy bbq sauce. Who would have thought it, but yummo! The pretzel bites looked like they were fried but were not greasy. They came with a little cup of melted cheese with a little kick to it. Towards the bottom I noticed some minced onions. Yum! We ordered the chicken ciabatta sandwich, the tavern double, a bacon burger and plain burger with A-1. The burgers were great! I asked for my fries well-done. They came out regular. I had to flag down Vanessa to get another order of fries. She made a comment that she was moving as fast as she could while pregnant. We told Vanessa that we were going to order a milkshake but needed a second to determine which flavor. She came back 10 minutes later. Really??? We almost left but the 11 year old at the table was very insistent that we have a mint brownie monster milkshake. For $5 the wait was almost tolerable. There were a ton of brownie chunks in that milkshake....so good!!! We were there for 2 hours. At 3pm on a Saturday afternoon, there was no reason for us to be there that long. As the daughter of a single Mom who worked 3 jobs and waited tables, I have the utmost sympathy for working Moms...but when you can't find your server and you have to flag down a busboy, a hostess and even a manager....I think sympathy has crossed the line.

120,Sam C.,"Frederick, MD",6,38,,1.0,2014-12-22,"I'd like to simply write ""THE WORST RESTAURANT EVER!!!"" and call it a day. Not sure if Yelp would approve. So let me describe my last dining experience here, keeping in mind that it was representative of nearly every meal I've had at this restaurant. My special lady friend and I came in on a Tuesday night. There was no wait since most of the tables and booths were empty. We stood at the hostess podium for nearly 5 minutes before someone finally walked over and asked ""how many?"" There was no other greeting. No smile. No eye contact at all. We were briskly escorted to our booth which had not been cleaned. The dirty dishes were gone, but there was water and crumbs and stickiness everywhere. There was also food all over my seat. The hostess said nothing while she waited for us to sit down to this mess. I politely asked for another booth and she sighed loudly as she seated us elsewhere. We finally sat down and waited. And waited. At least 20 minutes passed before our server appeared. No introduction, no apology for the wait, only ""do you know what you want?"" ""Some silverware please,"" I responded. We ordered drinks, an appetizer, and our entrees. I also ordered a Monster Chocolate Shake. My soda arrived with ketchup and greasy fingerprints encrusted around the outside of the glass. After one sip of her soda, my friend complained that it tasted flat and ""dirty."" The chocolate shake I ordered wasn't chocolate. I couldn't tell what flavor it was. It had no flavor. We waited for our server to return so replacements could be ordered. 35 more minutes passed and no sign of her. I dropped $10 on the table and got up to leave. We were putting on our coats when a food runner arrived with our entrees. Still no silverware or napkins, drinkable beverages, or the appetizer we ordered. He told us he'd check on it, but never returned. Eventually our waitress wandered over. We requested new drinks, cancelled the missing tower of onion rings, and again asked for napkins and silverware. More than an hour had passed since we were seated when someone finally brought me a drink in a clean glass. And it was flat. And it tasted ""dirty."" I've worked in restaurants for years. More years than I'd like to admit. I know that unless the fountainheads (the plastic spouts) on the soda dispenser are cleaned and disinfected on a regular basis, mold and bacteria can grow. The syrup from the soda is a perfect food source for germs to flourish. Once enough crap gets growing on the fountainheads, the soda starts tasting dirty as those germs get washed into people's drinks. Nothing like a dash of mold to flavor your Diet Coke.  My replacement shake was melted, looking more like chocolate milk. It's not a complicated recipe. Just two simple ingredients: milk and ice cream. Not that fucking hard to make. I pushed my drinks aside and stared down at my sad, sad, chicken sandwich and the 7 french fries they generously gave me. 7 cold french fries. I wondered if they had been left behind on someone else's plate and then recycled. My friend ordered her cheeseburger ""extra well done, almost burnt."" Instead the inside was pink. Very pink. We sat quietly while we waited for our waitress to return. 25 more minutes passed and still no waitress. The odds of getting new fries and a well done burger before breakfast were almost zero. The odds of us coming back were less than zero. I grabbed a manager as he walked by and I asked for the check. For just the second time in my life I left no tip. Had Red Robin done the right thing, they would have comped the entire meal, reimbursed me for the wasted gas money, and bought me dinner at a real restaurant.

At about 7:30, we still hadn't been seated so my friend went to go ask the host and hostesses what was going on. When she went over, they claimed that they had no one under that name and that maybe she put it under a different name. The one she was talking to proceeded to turn his back to her and then call the next group of 2 people who had arrived after us. I then went up to the station to ask what was happening and the girl I talked to told me they already seated us which obviously they had not. The girl then turned her back on me and then when she turned around she was short and rude and said she would do her best and that was it. They finally seated us and the hostess that seated us dropped our menus on the table and walked away. Luckily, our waiter was great and very polite and made up for the experience in the front.

They seem to always be shorthanded with servers/bartenders.

63,Brian C.,"Germantown, MD",31,83,92.0,2.0,2015-05-26,"My 2 stars are based on how I rate being treated as a customer. If management was present they did a good job of avoiding the dining areas. Unlike previous years,  where a manager made sure my free birthday burger for Red Royalty was properly comped,  my spouses lesser expensive burger was comped. In addition,  no one wished me a happy birthday at the end,  unlike the past where a manager made sure to come out and personally say happy birthday plus ensure my burger was the one comped.  As for our meal,  the burgers were prepared as described and cooked as ordered. They were very good and fresh tasting. My fries appeared to have sat a while. My refills were perfect,  which enforced my observation that the initial order sat too long. They were not very crisp,  a few had sagged over.  For my bottomless fries,  when we ordered I requested half regular and half sweet potato. The server said I'd have to pay extra,  then said they would check with a manager. I was served just regular fries,  which I stated was my choice if I had to pay extra to get both. When I wanted a refill I was again informed I would have to pay extra if I wanted sweet potato fries. Both are available,  I could not understand why they are not interchangeable. Our server either did not inform a manager of my requests or the management just doesn't care about talking to customers.  The service in general was very slow. Our server appeared to also be a bartender. They quickly checked after our entrées were served,  then avoided us for an extended period of time. I really wanted some extra fries during my meal,  unfortunately I was done with my burger before the server returned. The server cleared my plate and left my spouses empty plate on the table.  After getting a serving of extra fries, my spouses empty plate still sat there. The server showed back up about 10 minutes later. After I provided my loyalty card the server stopped at another table to take their order. What was unusual about that was I observed her immediately get the checks for several other tables once they were done. Our initial order took over 10 minutes to place for example as she provided quick check service to two tables plus took another tables order,  even though that table was seated well after we were.  This leads back to where I started this review.  Most of my reviews focus on the food,  but those are good reviews.

139,Shawn H.,"Gaithersburg, MD",8,72,14.0,1.0,2015-06-12,"Disclaimer:  This review was written by my wife who spent 10+ years in the food industry as a server, bartender, and manager... she knows what she's talking about. I want to start by saying that I have been going to this location since it first opened.  I used to frequent it often and really enjoyed it.  I never hesitated to recommend it to friends/family.  After our visit today, I can honestly say that I won't be back.  Here is a rundown of our experience this evening... We were a party of two and were sat immediately although it was inside while we requested outside.  There were about eight open tables on the patio, we were told at first that it wouldn't be a problem but, after our seater spoke to the main hostess it became abundantly clear that it would be a hassle for them. ""A party of eight was going out there and they just weren't sure how many tables they would need""... again there were seven or eight unused tables, indicated by the umbrellas being down (something the seater initially explained)... No big deal, but would have preferred to see them go the extra mile to try and accommodate a simple request, no one even checked. The restaurant itself is starting to look a bit rundown, the place was dirty, the floor had trash, spills, etc., and our table was sticky.  The bathrooms were dirty and poorly stocked, the women's room had no toilet seat covers but it did have an employee hanging out in it on her cell phone...   Worst of all our silverware came out with something on it, grossly akin to used dental floss.  The second set we received, which the server assured me she ""scrubbed"" herself, was also dirty (pictures are attached). Our server was oblivious, and seemed very bored or distracted.  I didn't feel welcomed, I don't remember her smiling once.  She was not the only one on  the staff that was struggling.  We watched as a table near us, with a hungry toddler, sat for 20 minutes unacknowledged by anyone until the mother sought out a server herself, they then sat another 7 minutes waiting for him to help them (at this point the rush was dying down, no excuse) ... when their server finally showed up her timing was comical to me and her shuffling gait was not indicative of someone who had been MIA for 20 minutes.  Not long after that a gentleman at the table next to ours spent several minutes trying to get the attention of any one of a gaggle of servers at a terminal, all just standing around chatting, it honestly seemed as though they were intentionally ignoring him, I even tried to flag someone down for him, he finally had to get up and go to them to request extra  napkins.  Everything from our drinks to our check and take out order for my husband (which the server almost forgot altogether) was SLOW.  This can be attributed to the Friday night rush to some degree but from what I could see of the line, I suspect it had alot more to do with expo, runners, and servers.   That is our segway to the food, it was just okay.  Honestly I don't expect anything phenomenal from a burger joint especially a not-so fast food place but I have never been so disappointed with Red Robin.  One of the great things about this restaurant is that it is usually pretty good and reliable.  Today it was underwhelming and SLOW, admittedly the experience may have made me more critical of the food but that just emphasizes the importance of the front of the house staff!  My son and I had fried jalapenos to start, they were way too salty and totally over cooked.  That was followed a twenty minute wait for food.  At no point there did the server come by to offer refills or see how we were doing.  When she finally showed up she came from the bathroom and was shocked that we hadn't received our meals yet (something she might have noticed had she stopped by sooner).  After she dropped off our food she disappeared again, never checking back to see if our food was okay or if we needed anything else... I digress from the food... My son ordered the Whiskey River BBQ Chicken Wrap, this is something my husband has ordered in the past so I thought it would be great for the boy, it was so weak.  It was 80% shredded lettuce, my 9 yr old questioned the freshness of the chicken, saying even he could tell it had been frozen, not sure how he could tell there was so little chicken to it and even less flavor.  I was excited to try the new Nacho Crunch Tavern Double which boasts a mouth-watering blend of flavors in it's description... I have to call foul on the claim, I paid twice what I would have for a burger at Five Guys, and got a  burger that was just okay (nowhere near what the menu described).  The fries were under cooked and kind of saggy but at this point, that is just a footnote ...  I am sorry to say that I won't be back, it has always been a favorite ""guilty"" indulgence and fun celebration place for report cards and sports endeavors and such.  I would prefer to keep the memory of Red Robin as it was.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-germantown?start=120,2.52,2.52,2.52,1.3480000000000003,2.52

Slow service or understaffed...constantly.  You decide. Last visit:  My family sat in booths right near the  Kitchen.  We can see the food coming out.  Watched our food slowly slide down the ""pass"" where clear signs are displayed indicating how long the food had been sitting, ready.  Waitress was no where to be found, drinks are empty, and we watched our food sit there.  Plenty of other servers passed by, but none stopped, even as we tried to get their attention.  20 minutes later we get our food, fries are cold  and drinks still are not filled.  I thought we had it bad, but the lady in the booth next to us had to send her burger back.  Her two young daughters finished their food and she was still waiting on her burger.  She was left the fries to eat, but never got her burger. The waitress forgot.   Forget bottomless fries.  You won't ever see your server to ask for more.  Took her over 10 minutes to bring our check/charge receipt back.  Everything took awhile to get, many mistakes with kids' food order and adult orders.  Horrible experience!  The worst-we decided that we will not be returning, even the kids agreed. P.S. Saw a wait staff once drop a stack full of napkins out of the cabinet onto the floor while attempting to refill the napkin basket.  He started to push them off the floor into the basket until he saw me watching him.  He picked them up and threw them out and smirked a little smile at me.

There seems to be a change in the entire staff. New management and staff is unfriendly and very unattentive. The restaurant wasn't busy when we visited and we ended up waiting to place our drink orders and food orders. We felt ""abandoned"" as our waitress took down her long hair, combed through it with her fingers, and put it back up--all while standing behind the bar. Without washing her hands, she came back to the tables she was waiting on and even served our food. When we ordered the same drinks that we always have, we were told that they never had the drinks we were ordering (which included gingerale) with no explanation or alternates offered. My standard sandwich, Cod Sandwich, lettuce wrapped came out as a piece of fish with lettuce on top and no paper wrapping. Cole slaw was overly drenched in mayo. Before this obvious change in personnel, we were always greeted by friendly  people  who were professional and accommodating Food was always good and service all-around was top-notch.

Now they have added a creepy touch with video screens on every table.  They've taken out the video games that used to be up front and now charge $1.99 for unlimited game use on the tablets.  These things have cameras on them, btw, so who knows who's watching you/listening to you at your meal. Also, it appears that they've raised the prices of the burgers.  $15 a plate up for the adults now.  Kids meals still seem like they're cheap.

They can keep my 5 bottemless fries, I'm never returning. -------- Here is my edited part after being messaged about my rudely vague review. I sent this to Red Robin headquarters itself. "" August 27, 2015, 9:18pm I have never, ever done this before. I have never kept it on my mind all the way home and willing to contact a restaurant about a lack of pride and poor customer service. I went to this location tonight as a farewell to my sister as she leaves for school to scotland for 3 years and planned to have a good night. We attempted to make the best of what we could. To start off, the new ""technology"" devices on each table for ""orders, games, drinks, ect."" was one of the worst ideas Ive witnessed a restaurant do. The games button was pushed on accident charging the table an extra $2.00 and was not even used. Still got charged after our hostess said she would have it removed for us. After our meals we used the ""call server"" button and had it enabled for 25 full minutes, yes I had my phone time on after several other waiters noticed it flashing, including our own hostess. The device was utterly ineffective. The food was so bland, and for an average of $10.00 for each and every meal, it came out looking worse than items on the $1 menu from McDonalds. There were 9 of us total, including 2 kids under the age of 7, and the total came to $97.61. With that being such a large amount for a restaurant you would expect some kind of service. I was still hungry after my ""simple burger"" which looked like a dried cheeseburger from burger king, and my ""bottomless"" fried which included 8, yes eight, fries in a silver ring. The 25 minutes was spent with us waiting for the ""bottomless"" fries for another order for 4 people and 1 ""endless"" fruit salad. With the prices charged for the food, the lack of speedy an efficient service, plain food, pointless devices to make the staffs job easier, I would rate this experience a -10/10. One of the worst. So much for my sister having a great send off as we had planned. No thanks to our hostess Abby FA. And to automatically set a tip at 20% = $18.90, absolutely disgraceful.

Management doesn't have a clue on how they should run this place or any restaurant for that matter. I decided to go on a Sunday evening because I wanting to wind down from work, enjoy some good food, and watch some football highlights from earlier in the day. When I arrived, I noticed at least 3 groups of people ahead of me. The hostess greeted each group and informed them of the wait times. I could hear at least one group kinda disappointed over being told that it would be 20 minutes before they could be seated. The bar area was empty for the most part, so my guest thought it would be quicker to sit at the bar. When we walked over to the bar area, it was at least 5 tables that still had trash and plates everywhere. We walked back to the hostess and she told us that someone was going to come back to buss the tables.  Hold on...Time Out!!! It shouldn't have gotten to that point where 5 tables still had trash and plates on them. Why do they not have someone cleaning the tables off!!  So the hostess said it would take about 5 minutes for someone to return. We waited...and waited...and waited. Nothing!! So at that point, I asked the hostess to speak with a manager. She told me she would get a manager and the manager came over in a matter of maybe 20 seconds later. I told him about the bad service and the long wait time. That guy clearly has no idea on how to operate a restaurant. Your first priority should be seating the guests. Tables shouldn't have trash and plates scattered everywhere and remain dirty!? A dirty table means you are unable to fill the table with guests. That means your restaurant loses out on getting money and servers lose out on getting tips. The manager on duty should have made sure his tables were cleaned in a timely fashion and ready for his hostess to seat guests. If that manager was so quick to come over and speak to me when asked, he should have used that same speed and energy to help buss those tables. One couple who was ahead of me was told about the 10-20 minute wait time in the regular seating area. If the bar section was clean, maybe the hostess would have been able to ask the couple if they wanted to sit in the bar area instead so that they wouldn't have to wait.  So since this Red Robin wants to be nasty, please do yourself a favor and stay far away from this place. I despise lazy managers.

They usually seem pretty slammed or overwhelmed when I'm there. During my last visit it took quite some time for our food to arrive. It must have taken at least 20 minutes for our two sandwiches to arrive. However, the server, although seemingly flustered, managed to stay positive and attentive. She gave an effort to be pleasant and courteous and I appreciate that.  Now for the food. I ordered the royal red Robin with the fried egg. I've had it in the past where the egg is overcooked. This egg was perfectly runny. The burger was cooked to my liking and the fries were nice and hot. My second order of bottomless fries arrived much faster. I also ordered the bottomless root beer float. I was a little disappointed in the fact that the ice cream and root beer were not separate. In the past I was given a glass of root beer and a glass of ice cream to combine myself, and add more soda as I go. I didn't have that this time around, not did I receive a spoon for the ice cream. That being said, I have not real complaints about the food.

I was craving a burger and some dessert but I would've had a better meal at any other burger joint. The service was horrendous. I asked our server to clean up our table ( tiny table, three of us plus a baby) because we were ready for some dessert. She left all of the plates. I had to move the plates to the other table because we needed room.  Im not sure if they don't clean up until you leave anymore because there were at LEAST seven dirty tables. THEY WERENT EVEN BUSY and i saw about 3 others doing noting.  The new payment method is to pay credit card only so we asked for the check because we had some cash. We were very specific when we said we were going to pay half and half, waived chick down a couple of times and got ignored. We ended up paying with a card so we wouldnt wait any longer and the machiene never printed a receipt.  Oh.. i could've had a yummier burger at burger king.  We had the oreo mud cake for dessert and it tasted like it had been in the fridge uncovered for years. Old.  Our cups that our sodas were in looked dirty. I promise i could see fingerprints from the last person who drank from it.  Anyway, A WORD TO WHOEVER IS RUNNING THIS PLACE!!needs to do a reevaluation of their staff, chefs, and busers!

41,Kristine D.,"Germantown, MD",200,196,2568.0,3.0,2016-02-01,"This Red Robin location is pretty middle of the road for me. I've never had a bad experience here, but nothing was particularly above and beyond either. The food is always good, and generally cooked the way I like it. The staff is friendly and fairly quick. Although, they certainly do get swamped in the evenings (and the weekends I imagine). The parking lot is pretty much a jumbled mess that easily gets congested from the nearby IHOP. I typically order my burgers medium from here, and they usually arrive somewhere between medium and medium-well. Whenever I've ordered a fried egg on top, I'm glad to report that it arrives a little runny. I hate getting an overcooked fried egg. It's like, ""What was even the point then?!"" The fries have always been hot and crispy. No problems getting refills on their bottomless fries, but I've always had to have the initiative to ask for it after getting my burger. If I waited until he or she checked in on me, I wouldn't get it until most of my meal was done. It would be nice if they asked about refills as the food was dropped off. Also, I love a juicy burger, but more often than not, the bottom bun is usually soaked by the time I get to dig into it.  This location always seems to serve their burger a tad bit greasier than at other locations. I've ordered a root beer float from here, and it was okay. I've been to other locations where they fill it 50/50 with soft serve and root beer and bring an extra glass of root beer so you can refill it with root beer as needed. This is also perfect for when you like your root beers to be part beverage/ part dessert, like myself. This location also has a nifty new gadget on the tables that I've only seen before a handful of times. This little computer screen is helpful for places like this that can easily get slammed. There's a button for alerting your server in case you can't seem to spot him or her for a refill or more napkins. You can also play games, explore the menu further, sign-up for a loyalty card, and pay with your credit card. This is pretty ingenious, especially if you're wary about handing over your credit card or hate waiting for your check. I'm hoping this becomes more ubiquitous in the restaurant industry. Although, I do feel that it shouldn't allow for service to decline. This location could definitely use some work on that especially in terms of consistency and being a step ahead on their refill game. Why keep calling fries and drinks bottomless if I have to chase you around for it?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-germantown?start=40,1.6,1.6,1.6,1.9320000000000002,1.6000000000000003

His. Mouth. I wanted to barf. We stopped eating. Explained and showed the waiter (I wish I'd gotten a picture for this review) and he quickly whisked it away, looking quite horrified himself. He brought new Mac and cheese and removed it from the check, of course. But that was it. The manager didn't come over. No other efforts were made to compensate for such a disgusting, appetite-killing, incident. I felt like they should have gone to greater lengths.

99,Deepak K.,"Germantown, MD",0,5,,1.0,2016-02-03,"We have been going to Red Robins since it opened up in Germantown, MD. To-date till this past Saturday, we have had a good experience.  This time we had a horrible experience. From seating to food it was a disaster. The hostess was more interested in talking to her co-workers rather than seating us. The waitress was too busy (though the restaurant was 60% empty) to come and take an order. When we placed our order for drinks and an appetizer, the drinks came, but there were no napkins or stirrer for the drinks. The appetizer never came. Right after our drinks were served, the main course was served, and then it dawned on the server that we had ordered an appetizer, which we refused because of the main course already served. The food was cold and not cooked properly. Finally, at our request, the manager came and despite our complaint and the return of food to be re-cooked and served, it was the same food served without anything done. We then observed it was not only us but several people around us on other tables had the same complaints. We by then were so tired of complaining, we asked for our check, the manager did give us a discount but for the service and the food, we should not have been charged. After paying our bill and walking out of the restaurant we observed the filth on the floor with napkins all around, but the most appalling unhygienic thing were the tablets that are placed on each table for on-line ordering. The screens were so dirty and it appeared that they have not been cleaned since installed. With this experience, we have decided never to go back to Red Robins, at least the one on Century Blvd., Germantown, MD.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-germantown?start=80,1.56,1.56,1.56,1.7000000000000002,1.5600000000000003
69,Carla C.,"Silver Spring, MD",20,22,62.0,2.0,2016-02-06,"I go to Red Robin because my children enjoy it so much.  I'm not sure if it's because of the ""Ziosk"" that they can play on resembling their tablets or the smiley face pizza.  My kids are picky eaters, I've come to realize that it's not the food that keeps us coming, it's the family atmosphere.  Actually, the food NEVER comes out fresh.  Now by fresh I mean, hot...steam still coming from the fries.  Instead the fries ALWAYS come out flat, hard, and just plain old tasting.  Okay, I'm a picky eater too, but is it too much to ask for hot food? I mean I could've probably done better at IHOP next door or Longhorn...heck, even the Chick fil A across the way!  I have never left this place satisfied with my meal.   I usually get the Bonzai burger with pineapples, it's okay...not terrible and not great either.  I figure since my kids love this place so much I'd better figure out a dish that I am okay with.  The pineapples are overcooked and a little watery.  The flavor is decent.   The servers have always been great though.  I have no complaints about that.  This particular Red Robin is just missing the ""IT"" factor.  It's just a place to go to get a kick out of your kids enjoying themselves (i.e. Playing on the tablet, coloring Red Robin, writing on the chalk board etc.).

I let it go because our food came out. She didn't come to check on us until 28 mins after our food was down; yes I timed her. We all needed refills and a few of my guests wanted a refill on fries. Why did we ask for anything at all; it took 12 mins for the fries to come out and half of our refills to come. We reminded her what refills she forgot and she left and never came back until it was time for the check. She mentioned to us that we could pay with credit card on the Ziosk machine, which was a fail, because after flagging her down to ask her about the check, she said, ""oh, I never linked your table number to the machine.""

We were supposed to go to the Red Robin at Lakeforest before they closed, but I didn't like the fact that it was in the mall and I didn't want to go to the mall, so we came here instead. Boy, I wish we went to the mall one... Our server came and took our drink orders and brought them back. However, she didn't come back to take our food order. My husband was like did she forget about us? Thirty minutes later, another server came by and took our order and said our server was talking to the manager. Ok... Do that during your break or when you don't have customers. She brought our food, no apology, and checked up on us after that. All our drinks were from the bottomless menu and not one refill. I only ordered a dessert because of the offer for free dessert if at least $10 or more was spent. The cheesecake she brought us looked nothing like the one on the menu: no whipped cream, strawberries, or berry sauce, just the cheesecake. Our server said only one offer could be used; we were redeeming my birthday burger offer as well. If I was gonna spend $6+ for a slice of cheesecake, I can get one from the Cheesecake Factory. I wouldn't have minded paying for it either, if it came with all the toppings. I don't remember how much my husband tipped, but I hope it wasn't his usual 18-20%. Came back again for my daughter's 3rd birthday. It was either here or Outback because I had a 20% off entire bill for both places. Anyway, I called the day before and whoever took my call said they can't guarantee my reservation. Got there the next day and the hostess was like we don't take reservations, after I said I called the day before. Ok, you don't have to be rude about it. I should've just turned around and called everyone that we're going to Outback instead. Whoever took my call should've said they don't take reservations. Yes, I should've checked Yelp too. Anyway, took them awhile to get tables together for 18 adults (another came later) and 3 kids. They did a long table (there was only 2 ways out for people sitting inside to go to the restroom) and a booth. Bad setup. The two pros for the server: She got us fries immediately and gave us 10% off our bill. The red royalty card took off one free item. I didn't bring everyone here for one person to get a free burger. I gave my daughter the choices and she picked here. Don't think she knows, but whatever. We took her to Chuck E. Cheese on her real birthday. This was her celebration with the family. The server said they have no control over which offer is used. I had set the 20% off entire bill as my top offer too. But probably when she swiped my card, the 10th item free got priority. That's why our server gave us 10% off entire bill. Again, I ordered a bottomless drink, no refills. Just take those drinks off that menu if there's no refills. My end of the table didn't get any fresh fries. Only the first basket. My brother-in-law got a totally different burger than what he ordered. I said send it back, but he declined. I also don't know who ordered what, so there could've been items on there that no one ordered. I did count the entrees and there was the right amount. Don't know about apps and drinks. Two guests also didn't order an entree, just an appetizer to share. I'm definitely not dining in there ever again.

The hosts/hostesses are always nice and welcoming and generally, there are a lot of different TV show options...assuming that is something you care about in the bar area.  The food and drinks we ordered were also good and timely. We both ordered the MADLOVE burger and it was perfectly cooked medium, with a balanced portion of toppings. The sauces we requested were added to the plate for our fries which were always fresh, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Now for the service. I should first say that the bartender is, and has always been nice. Most of the time we come in here we sit in the bar to watch sports, or in this case, the Olympics, and the problem always seem to be in the bar but not because of her attitude. Simply put, there is always one bartender who services the restaurant and all the tables in the bar. Why this is the case I have no clue because I have seen the bartender try to make all the drinks for the tables in the restaurant and tend to the patrons at the bar, but in my experiences, this only spells out mayhem. I dont blame the bartender as much either but rather management for having this be such a persistent problem. I also see it in other peoples comments of this location. Anyways, the bartender took a long time to get to us originally to ask what we wanted to drink and when she finally did, you can tell she was in a rush to get to the other customers. So she takes our drinks, and doesnt come back with them until way later, which at this point, we ordered our food through the manager who had brought us some fries to snack on because she was taking long. After we ordered our food, we got our drinks and didnt see her again until the end of the meal. At this point, I saw the managers be more present in this area. I guess they caught on that she needed help and they often came and checked on us. This is where the service progressed with the managers essentially taking the role of a server and was steady until we asked for our check.  So 3.5/5 (because I cant do half stars) stars for good food, friendly staff and the service pickup by the managers. I took one star away because this is a consistent problem which clearly hasn't been fixed by management (kind of a paradox huh) and a half star away for half the bad service we received at this location. I hope this helps and I also hope they get there stuff together!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-germantown?start=100,2.04,2.15,2.15,2.1879999999999997,2.1060000000000003

I was always a big fan of their burgers and bottomless steak fries, but the menu has expanded now to include even more burger options (even some healthier ones), milkshakes, spiked milkshakes, mixed drinks, and desserts. So many recently menu items are unique to Red Robin and I'm pleasantly surprised.  Drinks: The cupcake milkshake is simple but amazing. The Merry Moscato Punch is awesome and I didn't know until recently that it's being discontinued. I'm always on the lookout for moscato mixed drinks and I had never found one, let alone a good one, until I came to Red Robin. But apparently I got the last one. So disappointing! Please bring it back. Food: Get the onion ring tower or chips and guac/tomatoes as an appetizer. The Whiskey River BBQ burger is so yummy. So are the Burnin' Love and Sauteed 'Shroom burgers.

55,Carolyn R.,"Silver Spring, MD",0,7,,2.0,2016-10-23,"Well, if you are in the mood for kind of overpriced low average burgers, but admittedly tasty fries delivered after you have eaten the rest of your meal,  Red Robin will do you. I was always interested in trying this chain out, so our family of four, two kids under 8 and two parents tried it out tonight.  Food took about 20 plus minutes, was lukewarm at best, and bottomless fries proved a misnomer, when they never actually bring you any after the first limp serving.   The flavor of the sweet potato fries however was good, and when we eventually received our second helpings of steak and sweet potato fires, they were fresh, and definitely tasty.  I was supposed to be charged an extra $1.49 for the sweet taters, but I am not sure it appeared on our bill so that was nice considering the barely noticeable guacomole on the two burgers we ordered, one of which actually had guacamole in the name on the menu.  I couldn't even really taste any guacamole.   One plus is the kids meals which are reasonably priced, and our kids seemed to enjoy but the $2.99 milkshakes tasted like they are made with really crappy ice cream.  However, when it comes to families with kids, the biggest issue has not to do with the food, but the borderline reprehensible practice of leaving a game boy like monitor on each table, foisting them on unsuspecting parents with no mention from host, server or explanation on the video screen of a $1.99 charge.  While the manager was pleasant enough when asked about this practice, and did remove one charge, his attitude seemed to indicate that he knows this is a problem and others have complained, but Red Robin isn't interested in doing a thing about it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-germantown?start=40,2.0,2.13,2.13,1.9920000000000002,2.0780000000000003

I went here on a Friday evening around 5p or so, right before the dinner rush.  We were seated promptly, sitting in the bar area per our request. Our server was the bartender and had I realized that prior to our ordering, I would have requested a new table. He was obviously very busy trying to make drinks for the restaurant, serve those sitting at the bar as well as those around him at the bar tables. Consequently, he paid very little attention to us during our meal. He was pleasant when he did come around, it was just obvious that he was spread too thinly and it affected his ability to perform good service. Additionally, there were multiple flies/gnats in the bar area. I suspect it likely was due to cut up fruit at the bar, but, annoying and gross regardless.  We also had an issue with my Red Robin Royalty card. Our server did bring the manager over because he couldn't figure it out and she provided us with the discount despite being able to run the card. She also provided us with information on how to get the card/account fixed. Overall, I felt like there were attempts to provide good service but that was overshadowed by our over-sat server.

The bottomless sides are nice, when you get them.  When you are there with the family you likely only have time for one refill at most since sometimes they come by and check, sometimes they don't, sometimes they completely forget to bring it when you order it.   You can't really rely on diving into piles and piles of delicious fried potato goodness...you know, if nobody actually brings any.

I spent a lot of time in that fair city for work, and often had evenings free where a reasonably priced meal was, well much needed.  The one in Germantown is located near the Germantown Regal theaters and in a cluster of restaurants around the Fairfield Inn, right off the bypass. We started the meal off with the tower of Onion rings. Always a good starting point for any meal. They are amazing as they always are! We then moved to the main course. I had the AvoCobb salad. A really nice mix of greens and other items. Tasty and well prepared. I do have to say our server was amazing! He was very quick and kept the table clear. I ended up with the Salted Caramel Sea Salt Malt. That was worth the visit right there. It is nice to be able to share a part of my former life (traveling) with my family. There were no Red Robins in Indiana so its nice to go and remember what was. The place is always packed. Both boys had burgers. They have in their many visits pronounced the burgers amazing. Luke actually tried the chili cheese fries and was quite happy. My wife had a teriyaki chicken salad.  Nick had a shake as well. We had a fun conversation explaining what a malt was to Nick.

I live in town and have been to this particular Red Robin many times. I have also spent many years working in the food service industry. That being said, the service at this specific Red Robin is atrocious from the host stand to the management. The restaurant is eternally understaffed, resulting in extremely slow and poor service. The hosts are typically uninterested and apathetic when dealing with guests. The wait staff is always spread thin and inattentive. On our most recent trip to the restaurant, our waitress  (who was actually quite nice and professional) made an error and charged my card with another table's bill (which was more expensive than ours) unbeknownst to me. On our way out of the restaurant we were stopped by a Manger who informed us that there had been an error in processing our bill. She initially tried to play this off as a simple error, which I can relate to. After about 10 minutes it was brought to our attention that yet another error was made in processing our payment. When asked about the situation the Manger in question became hostile and extremely unhelpful and rude. Thanks to this woman I am going to have to closely monitor my credit card statements for the next few months to ensure all is in order. At no time did anyone take the time to apologize for the error.

I have only been here maybe four times but each time there has been a reoccurring theme for what goes wrong. Like coming here a few months ago, and having the waitress rudely cut off my boyfriends dad mid sentence (see previous review). But, this was a while ago so I came in with my boyfriend and his dad again, and was hoping for a better experience.  Previous times my boyfriend has come here, with and without me, he has specified ""no mayo"" and ""no onions"" on his burger. And without fault, every single time it still came back with mayo and onions on it. This time, I watched the waitress specifically write and underline ""no mayo/onions"", and both him and his dad specifically mentioned please no mayo/onions, as previous times this has been ignored. Without fault, the burger comes, with mayo and onions!!!  Our waitress was great, very nice the entire time and happily brought the burger back and got him a proper one. I dont think it's a problem with this waitress, or any really, but the cooks.

Our server came and greeted us and got our drink order and proceed to come back with a tall blue moon for my boyfriend and a lipstick covered glass of wine for me.  I had to send it back and then was brought a clean glass.  Really?

First, that should have been explained when i ordered the appetizer, not after the fact.  Is there absolutely no communication with the kitchen and the staff????? My burger was missing the cheese and the mushrooms so she, again, had to go back and fix her mistake.  When she came back again she said ""we usually charge extra for those kinds of toppings but we ended up giving that to you for free"".  Wow.  Needless to say, our experience was below average and we made a decision that this would be our last time.  I did see a manager walking around but i saw her on the kitchen line playing around with the staff. There should have been 2 managers there that night, one at the host stand and one at the back of the house walking around to eat table greeting the guests, maybe even helping the overwhelmed staff.  This isn't rocket science, but somehow McDonalds seems like a better option at this point.

89,Rich S.,"Germantown, MD",0,34,,1.0,2017-03-27,"Wow...Red Robbin's are usually super places to grab a burger, but last night I had one of the worst experiences at this restaurant. Firstly let's start with the front of the store...mayhem...that's the only way to describe it. Basically the right hand had no idea what the left hand was doing so I opted to eat at the bar which proved to be equally as challenging. The bartender, albeit nice, had the personality of a cocktail napkin...which he neglected to give me when he served my drink in a dirty glass...you could see a film of something (probably an improperly washed/rinsed glass). I sent that back and went a safer route asking for a bottle of beer. After having to wave this young man down, twice, I placed my order. While waiting I hit the restroom to wash my hands and left there feeling as though I needed a shower. You can tell a lot about an establishment by merely walking in the bathroom. I shudder to think what the kitchen must look like judging by the condition of the restroom. But I digress...shortly after returning to the bar my luke-warm burger showed up on yes, a dirty plate. I vacillated on whether to send that back, but thought that was unwise and bit the bullet. The burger was tasty and went well with the 7 steak fries that came with....yup, I counted them...7 of them. I hope this place gets its act together; I'm sure I'm not the only one who's had this type of complaint...experienced management at this particular restaurant is severely lacking.

31,Yuna P.,"New York, NY",1061,363,173.0,1.0,2017-04-12,"I will preface this review by saying that the only reason why I dined at Red Robin was the unlimited steak fries. I heard about the unlimited fries through a commercial and being the steak fries lover that I am, I had to visit. We went on a weekend night, so perhaps that was our first mistake. Upon walking into the restaurant, we saw a huge wait and we were informed that there would be at least a 30-minute wait. We persevered and were seated next to a large group of raucous teenagers, who deeply made me rethink having my own children one day. The service was literally nonexistent. Perhaps it was because the restaurant was incredibly busy (let me give him the benefit of the doubt), but we rarely saw our waiter. Whenever we were miraculously able to get a hold of him, we would desperately request for more fries and drinks. Then we would see our order appear 20+ minutes later. Because of how long the service was taking (and my patience thinning each second), our unlimited fries and bottomless beverage wasn't exactly ""unlimited."" Avoid the weekend nights. If you are so inclined to dine here, try to make it during their off-hours (after lunch rush on a week day).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-germantown,2.16,2.12,2.12,1.6680000000000001,2.136

She did not even end the question with a noun like ""burger."" All  three adults at the table were not understanding her request at first, she rudely shouted it again.  I said to my table guests, ""who ordered medium rare, medium well, or well done?  It then clicked to all my guests that is what she meant by ""pink"" but I gather she thought none of us were intelligent enough to figure out the real way to ask our cooking choice for the burgers.  We all eat out on a regular basis, including the grandchildren and at better places than Red Robin.  I had French onion soup which is my favorite soup and it was the worst French Onion soup I have ever tasted in my life and I order French Onion Soup a lot from many restaurants.  This female who came from the kitchen is in the wrong career and if she made the soup, she definitely should give it up.  Bad experience overall.  The Sprite that three people ordered was just seltzer water and it took 3 requests and 15 minutes later before the third request was honored by a young man who was not waiting on us. I flagged him down because people were thirsty.  I tipped the wait person 20% only because both my now adult sons at some point waited tables and have done other jobs in the restaurant business.  I showed compassion because it certainly was not 20% service.  If it was left up to the lady who brought the food to us to also have been our server, I would have left nothing for a tip.  For me to take the time a day later out of my busy schedule to write a negative complaint on any business means that I am still very pissed off to have spent my money and been treated as such.

Didn't see them until we were done.  And yesterday our sever took our order someone else brought our appetizer someone else brought our food but not one of them refilled our drinks.  Our waitress was more interested in chatting with a couple of her coworkers she didn't even notice we got up and left after waiting about 15 minuets after we were done with our food.  Thank goodness for the little table thing where you can pay.   Will definitely not be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-germantown?start=40,1.96,1.96,1.96,,1.96
15,Rob K.,"Germantown, MD",0,4,,1.0,2017-11-03,"This place has, unfortunately, gone directly into the gutter.  What used to be a well-run, clean, and tasty experience has truly fallen on bad times.  Hostesses have absolutely no idea what they are doing.  It takes them a ridiculous amount of time to determine if they even have available tables for arriving customers.  Once seated, we have watched as tables with trash and leftovers have sat untouched by any worker for over half an hour.  During the same half hour, we watched at least half a dozen servers literally stepping on food that was on the floor instead of cleaning it up.  We have been served burnt burgers with cold french fries and sat and waited for a refill on s drink for 15 minutes while attempting to eat our meal.  We have talked to management on multiple occasions to let them know our concerns and refuse to take anything the restaurant offers as a monetary apology.  It's not about the money, the whole experience is terrible.  We've gone back a few times in the hopes that our concerns would be addressed...with no success.  The place has gotten even worse.  Avoid it and go somewhere else where your business would be appreciated.

After waiting 20 minutes for our waitress to return to check on us after dropping our food off, we used their fancy call button (a flashing light on that tablet checkout thing on their tables). 5 minutes later she noticed the light and strolled back to the table. As we hadn't been checked since we'd received our food, we had a few items to request (refills on our drinks, refill of my son's bottomless oranges, and a refill of the bottomless fries). She finally brought back my sons drink, then turned off the blinking light and walked away.  15 minutes later we left, having never seen our 'waitress' or requested again. She did walk by us plenty of times with other people's food. The only good part is that we could use their tablet thing to check out without waiting another 15 minutes. Hopefully our tip made a point, but i have a sneaking suspicion she didn't give a crap about that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-germantown,1.76,1.95,1.95,,1.874

23,Chau P.,"Washington, DC",220,107,182.0,4.0,2017-11-19,"1. Ambiance:  This is a fun and upbeat burger joint and I love the color scheme of the place. Red walls and tiles with fun patterned booths filled the restaurant. It is a casual restaurant and is a perfect place to spend time with friends/family while enjoying a great meal.  2. Food: This is an all you can eat french fries! Goodness, I am in heaven. However, I am not too crazy about their fries because it is quite big and not as crispy as I would like. It is a perfect place to carb load before a race though. I had ordered the Madlove Burger and had a food coma. The burger was humongous and the beef was so juicy with fresh toppings.  3. Service:  A star deduction for the service. The food took forever to come out and we were starving. It was not busy at all and I get it, perhaps there was a limited help in the kitchen. However, when the food came out, the server was not nice or apologetic. She also did not check up on us either.  4. Costs:  The burger costs $14.99, which is a lot for a burger. However, the portion is really big and it's all you can eat french fries! I hope that they can change up their french fries one day and get the really crispy kind.  5. Overall Experience:  Besides the service, I thought the food and decor were on the money. Perhaps the service was just an outlier of an incident, so I will make a visit later down the road if I need to carb load.

24,Mia S.,"Gaithersburg, MD",109,90,190.0,3.0,2017-12-09,"Red Robin has always been my go-to for burgers since In-N-Out can't be found on this side of the coast. I've never had a bad experience at this particular location but I was hoping that the service improved since my last visit. Food came out quick but the same old story with the service. I had to ask our waiter a few times to refill my water which I shouldn't have to do especially if I place it at the far edge of the table. A good server would refill the cups or bring out more drinks without being asked. The burger was made perfectly just how I like it and unlimited fries were delicious. Always ask for the campfire sauce as your dipping sauce, it has never failed me! My sister's order was okay except for the few pieces of sweet potato fries she had on her plate. The server saw our faces when he placed it on the table like...are you kidding me? He was nice enough to bring more out but again consistency is key.

28,Achilles W.,"Germantown, MD",5,1,,1.0,2017-12-15,"We used to go often. Visited on a Thursday night, not filled to capacity, no wait, no staff seemed rushed. Server walked by after the usual amount of time and says he will be right with us. After enough time to memorize the menu he showed up to take our drink order. Our server had the personality of a cardboard box, no emotion, no energy. Our food came out in a decent amount of time, fries were just warm, tasted like grease. My wife said the burger had no flavor in the patty. My entire order was wrong, so wrong that it was as if the server grabbed the wrong sandwich. I sent it back. After a few mins, the server came to tell me that I got what I ordered and read back the order he wrote down only to realize he was wrong. I waited and watched my family finish their food because the remake took longer than the initial order did. The manager delivered the food, very dry demeanor, apologized and offered a free dessert. I felt like it was a 'run of the mill' apology, and he didn't care that they got it wrong or that I had to watch my family finish before I could eat. The manager even pre-bussed my table so that my plate was the only one left. The server never filled our drinks until we asked for it, during our free dessert. Based on this experience, Red Robin might soon be on my don't eat here ever again list. As a side note: we know shit happens sometimes, how you handle/recover from it is how you retain guests, not caring is how you lose them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-germantown,1.6,2.0,2.0,,1.8400000000000003

My food obviously had been ready to get picked up from the kitchen, but the server didn't get around to it until the bottom bun had gotten soggy. She didn't check on us for refills even though she passed our table several times. I wound up putting ""call server"" light on to get a refill on the fries. She noticed the light after about 10 minutes. If we weren't hungry still, we would have given up on getting more fries because it took so long to get her attention.

21,Sarah T.,"Silver Spring, MD",116,3,,1.0,2018-01-06,"I'll start off by saying our server was so sweet and was always smiling. That's the only good thing I can say for our experience today.  Our server asked us what we wanted to drink and offered an appetizer; my husband and I ordered two beers, the dip ""trio"" and our daughters meal that is supposed to come with their choice of milk, juice, soda etc. We ordered her a milk that never came, my beer was apparently out, and the trio was basically one dish with a tiny bit of guacamole, salsa and corn salsa in each corner.  Our daughters meal came out first which we wanted, but still no milk. The side of fruit that is pictured on the menu looked fresh and plentiful, but when it came out, it was served in a to-go ramekin...? And looked like it had come from a can days before. My husband had ordered a second beer before the main course came out, but didn't get it until he was almost done with his meal. When our food did come out, my side salad that I ordered in place of fries was sitting right on the plate next to the burger and was warm and wilted due to the plate being hot. We could tell the plate had been in the window for a while before it came out. A salad is supposed to be cold and crisp, and usually served in its own bowl.  Our server was pretty much non-existent the entire time, but mostly because she looked weeded even though it appeared slow. We think the managers gave her too many tables outside of her main section. She was very apologetic about the salad, and offered to bring out a fresh one. We instead ordered a side of sweet potato fries for the table to share; those were alright. Our burgers were definitely good, but not good enough to have us go back anytime soon.  We've been to a couple of Red Robin's, and it's never been something to write home about, but with the average rating of this location being 2 stars, it's quite clear there's something very wrong with the way this location is being run. The only reason we went to this restaurant was because someone had bought us a gift card; if the money we spent had come out of our pocket, we would have absolutely asked to speak to a manager. This location needs a lot of help.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-germantown,1.64,2.04,2.04,,1.88
20,Matthew S.,"Baltimore, MD",220,125,102.0,4.0,2018-01-10,"Rolled in for dinner around 6:45p last night and what a treat it was. Decided to go with the chain's newly revamped veggie burger but swapped the whole grain bun for a sesame seed one instead. While the speed at which it was prepared and brought out was a little long, it was worth the wait. The burger was good and that's about it - nothing outrageously special but also something I would definitely order again when I'm looking for something veg to eat. The main highlight of my experience here was my amazing waitress, Rose. She greeted us the moment we sat down and was a pleasant presence throughout the entire visit - around just enough to get what we needed but not in that annoying way that makes it seem like you can't enjoy a meal without being bothered. We had multiple refills without having to ask, fresh fries brought out within minutes of her noticing that we had run out, and a smile on her face from start to finish. What a gem and truly a pleasure to be served by. Thanks Rose!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-germantown,1.72,2.07,2.07,,1.93
