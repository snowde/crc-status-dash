192,Jason H.,"Gilbert, AZ",10,46,4.0,2.0,2012-01-17,"Why do we keep coming back to this place? There was a running gag on Cheers. Norm would come in complaining about his recent visit to the Hungry Heifer.  No matter how bad the food was, Norm always went back and he never knew why exactly. I feel that way about this place, except I know why I keep returning: because my youngling likes the place.  If we didn't have a kid, or had one with better taste, I'd probably never return.  Look, it's not that the burgers are bad, it's that they're so mediocre. They are memorable for being so unmemorable. The one burger that I did kind of half-way enjoy (something with slaw and hot sauce I think) was discontinued. Chicken sandwiches are in the same class of unmemorable foods. So I stick with salads, which as salads go are pretty dull, and French onion soup. About that soup: I'm under no illusion as to what I'm getting at Red Robin as far as French onion soup goes. I've had some excellent onion soups (try Zinc Bistro or Sophie's sometime). I've made exceptional onion soups myself. Here, all I expect is that it kind of taste like an onion soup and that the onions are at least cooked down enough to be tender. This place used to be able to deliver, but recently the onions have been rather firm and the pieces of onion in the soup on the large side. The soup guy isn't slicing his onions fine enough and he's not cooking them long enough. I found the same thing happening at the Red Robin over on Cooper and US60. You know what I decided? SAME SOUP GUY!  He's just traveling around making lousy soup. At the other store he's actually going to the trouble of burning some of the onions beyond recognition so that you get mostly undercooked onions with a few pieces of carbon floating around for good measure. Just get rid of this guy, cook the onions properly, and we're back in business, Red Robin. Just you and me and your reasonably tolerable onion soup.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-gilbert?start=180,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006

Well I will tell you.  The turkey burger!  That's what can be so special about a chain.  Seriously, the BEST turkey burger I've ever had is at Red Robin (and trust me, I've had MANY).  If there's a turkey burger on the menu, you can rest assured I will order it, and time and time again, Red Robin is my favorite.  I feel a little ashamed admitting this, since, it is a chain after all. But seriously, it's so moist and delicious.  No one else can get it right.  It's either tasty and dry or moist and flavor-less, but NOT Red Robin.  It's consistently TASTY and MOIST!  Yes, that's right.  MOIST.  (Should I have given a warning at the beginning of this review that it would be R rated?) Anyway, if you love turkey burgers as much as I do, get yourself over to a Red Robin pronto, you're welcome. (p.s. get it with cheese, duh) p.p.s. the reason I knocked it down 1 star is because 1) it's very much a ""family"" restaurant, which means it's inevitably loud, and 2)  although they have great cocktails like spiked strawberry lemonade, the drinks are kinda pricey considering the lack of sufficient booze to drown out the ""loudness"" of the surroundings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-gilbert?start=120,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003

135,Julie H.,"Gilbert, AZ",1,58,25.0,3.0,2013-01-24,"We've eaten here many times. It's pretty good food overall. They usually have a hard time getting your food out quickly and hot. Unfortunately this seems to be happening more often than not. Recently, while waiting a LONG time for our order to arrive, we thought we saw our food sitting in the window for a while before it arrived at our table. When it finally arrived it was cold (not surprisingly). They re-heated or re-made it for us, but that added to our wait (which seemed really long already). Not a great experience.  We like that you can get the fries out before your meal, this keeps our ""starving"" children from whining while they wait. But even this isn't consistent. Some visits we get them early, some we only get them w. the meal.

As usual I order the clucks and fries, buffalo style.  When I order the clucks I ask for an extra plate so I can cut into them instead of trying to cut them in the basket and cutting up the paper. When I cut into the clucks this evening I noticed the chicken was extremely undercooked and by this time I had already taken my first bite. It was very pink in the middle and made me immediately stop eating. The server came back to the table and we explained what was going on, she offered to cook a whole new set. I went through the rest of the chicken to see if it was necessary and 3 out of the 4 pieces were all undercooked. I immediately gave her the entire basket back because I didn't want anything more to do with the food in it. She was nice enough to bring me out a new meal and comp me for the clucks but by then my entire table had already finished their food and had to then wait on me to eat my entire meal. I was nervous eating this basket but all seemed to be ok this time around. I appreciate the new basket and giving me my meal for free but undercooked chicken makes me very nervous.

Plus unlike most Red Robins they don't bring a plate of fries while you wait and when you do get your order they only give you a half order of fries. The only reason I still give it 3 stars is because the food is still good, as long as you can wait 40-50 mins. Make sure to proactively ask for fries while you wait for your food, the waiters/waitress won't offer it and they won't offer to bring more out unless you ask, which I find different than most Red Robins I've been to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-gilbert?start=160,3.6,3.6,3.6,2.572,3.6000000000000005

At 10 mins in, people are sitting down and ordering. Our server is bringing out food left and right. he tells us our food ""will be right out"". About 25 minutes later several people are now sitting at the bar high tops and some of them are eating and a couple of guys who sat down after us were already finished with their meal. We call our server over and tell him that people who sat down after are already finished with their meal, he says ""Oh, don't worry your food will be right out."" An indication that he was clearly incompetent was when he put in a food order after ours and is  bringing it out before ours. We tell him that we would need our food to to go because we had places to be. About 10 minutes later the manager comes out (with no food in hand) and says that they must have lost our ticket in the back and he will go back there and see what's going on.

It's been two years since our last visit so I was hoping it had improved (couldn't get much worse), but boy was I wrong. Went there today (Thur about 1pm). 20 min later the waiter took our drink order. We ordered an appetizer which never did arrive even after we reminded our server. Our 20 mo old was getting fussy so we asked for a small plate of French fries, which also, never arrived. 40 min later our food arrived and once again, just like before, it was COLD. I ordered a hot prime rib sandwich. Ridic! My daughters grilled cheese was blah with unmelted cheese, fries were cold, and my entree was missing the coleslaw. I politely requested it again, but it too was elusive. They took my sandwich back to the kitchen and nuked it. Seriously I cannot say one good thing about the quality of the food or service. Truth is, I will tolerate sub par service for a good meal, but everything from the iced tea to my stale bread and the undercooked and tasteless steak fries was beyond disappointing. Our toddler even refused the fries and he eats everything!! We spoke with manager after paying and she offered a comp. Umm no thanks but greatly appreciate the gesture. The mgr was a sweetheart and admitted our server was normally a bus boy but they got so busy they had to have him serve. A scheduling problem maybe? Anyway it just couldn't make up for the awful food. I would avoid this RR. We can't make sense of the good reviews.

99,Andrea C.,"Auburn, WA",41,51,4.0,3.0,2014-02-24,"I normally love Red Robin, but my experience here the other day wasn't as good as it could have been. We got there around 4:30 or so, and there was apparently a 25 minute wait for a table. Even though there were empty tables in the restaurant. Maybe it's because there were 5 of us plus a highchair? I don't know. My father-in-law notices that there is a table on the patio and asks if we can have that one instead. The host stand said yes, it's first come first serve on the patio, but got very snippy that we didn't want to wait. So we go outside and have to find someone to clean off the tables (we needed two since they were only 4-tops), and the person who did looked extremely annoyed to be bothered by doing so. He cleaned off the tables, didn't put them together for us and rearrange the chairs, and gave us a highchair with crusted on food and liquid spilled all over it. So we had to clean the highchair off, put the tables together and arrange all the chairs. I also had to go track down silverware and napkins because there weren't any placed on the table. Our waiter was the bright spot - he was prompt, very nice and took our orders quickly. He brought us our menus (and a kids menu right away when asked) and made sure we had waters and our appetizer as soon as possible. My sister-in-law (she's 12) ordered a milkshake and he brought her a large one instead of the kid size.  My food was good - we had the onion ring appetizer (YUM), I actually just got the pick 2 appetizer for my meal. Cheese sticks and zucchini sticks, both were good. My drink was lacking in the flavor arena - I got the Sand in Your Shorts. It tasted mainly like sweet and sour. Nothing like what I was expecting. So three stars instead of two due to our waiter.

140,Mina R.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,61,2.0,2.0,2014-03-14,"We dined at this location on 03/14/2014 evening. Pros: The food was fantastic! Cons: We call ahead and put our name on the wait list. We get there and they don't have our name on the list. So whatever. The wait time is estimated to be 25-30 minutes. So....we put our name on the list once again. We wait about 40 minutes. The hostess comes outside and says sorry but our ipad system is down. Meanwhile we notice the patio is empty. Its first come first serve. We go to check it out and a server comes up to us and says to take a seat if we would like and that we have 100% of her attention. Awesome! We sit and we order. Five minutes later a party of 25 comes outside. We get our food. We didn't get napkins, and didn't get any refills. Not even a question of weather everything came out correctly. At that point we understand that she is going to be busy but we expected for her to at least come and check on us at least once. Well she did...... when we were almost finished. We wanted more fries. That took another 10 minutes. And I have to mention that she didn't bring out our food and didn't refill our drinks. We did manage to get the attention of another server to get more fries, drinks and some napkins. Meanwhile the large party is being taken care of completely. And.....the manager is helping her with that large party. He looks over at us at least twice and never bothers to ask if we need anything. We were just sitting there waiting for our tab. I'm sure anybody could see that we were annoyed and ready to go. We made eye contact and he just passed. Nothing. So after the other server brings us our tab, our original server comes over and apologizes for not giving us 100% of her time. That the large party came in and they needed to be taken care of. Ok lady....we didn't need 100% but 25% would have been nice. I get it......big party equals big tip. But how RUDE of you to treat us like trash. So disappointed. It all could have been avoided with a couple trips over to us to see how we were doing. No tip for you. We will not be coming back to this location. EVER! Completely and utterly unacceptable!

61,Brett C.,"Gilbert, AZ",10,7,10.0,2.0,2014-03-29,"I work in the restaurant industry so the next two cents I'm about to offer should not be taken lightly.  I have a terrible habit of watching and critiquing restaurants as I'm eating, but very rarely will I post about my experience. I come to Red Robin frequently, always hoping my experience will be better than the last.  The food is always delicious. There's no doubt about that; however, the service is consistently poor to fair in ranking.  It took close to seven minutes after arriving to be greeted and asked if we'd like drinks. I travel with a 5-year-old so I expect a children's menu of some sort. That never came. It took our server THREE times at our table to even ask if we were ready to order. He would come by and say, ""be right back"" every time. I was ready to go right away because we are creatures of habit and get the same thing every time. I'm not saying he should have known that, and I understand he was busy (although I only saw one other table he was serving), but he should have at least asked.  The managers were involved and walking around as they should, but you'd think they would make more of an effort with their guests. I didn't see them attempt to talk to tables or check in to see how things were going. There is a very cute, middle-aged manager who works at this location and she ALWAYS checks in on the tables. She's the blonde one if you ever stop in. She's genuine and very sweet.  There was one server named Aron (I think that's how it was spelled on his tag) who I saw always with a guest, constantly checking in, and getting drinks and food out right away. He wasn't our server, but he looked like he knew a thing or two about good service.  This isn't a terrible place for lunch, but if you're with a child and you don't look like you'll have a bill over $50, you might not get the greatest service.  For the record, despite this review, our bill was $11.61 and I am leaving a $20. I hope that proves how much HOPE I have for this place.

From 2014 Update... We went back and had horrible service, waited so long that the hostess ended up taking our drink and food order.  Waited about 7 to 10 more mins and the drinks never came out.  The managers walked by us multiple times but are too concerned with wiping already cleaned tables down to make eye contact with any customers.  The hostess seated another family and noticed our drinks and appetizer weren't out yet.  She went back and got them for us.  The waitress eventually showed up but never introduced herself to us.  I want sure she was a waitress until the second stop by.  I was surprised by the lack of service considering we were sitting at the tables right by the kitchen. ( the ones with the big red chairs)  In the end the hostess came back and checked in us, and apologized again for waiting so long.  When the waitress brought the check out she said the manager took half price off one burger because they messed up the order.  I ended up tipping the hostess more than our waitress because she was more helpful.  When we were leaving a we told the manager she was great and filled in because our waitress was absent most of the time.  He didn't acknowledge it, and seemed upset that I tipped the hostess.  Maybe if the managers spent more time managing and not wiping down tables that were already cleaned and trying to look busy, they would have better service.  After several negative trips to this location we have given up.  If the craving for red robin hits again, I'll make the drive to the Chandler location instead.  I will not step foot back in this location ever again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-gilbert?start=140,2.84,2.84,2.84,2.408,2.84

158,John G.,"Orange, CA",0,21,5.0,1.0,2015-01-30,"Okay, lets start with when I first walked in. I ate here yesterday morning, I walked in a couple minutes after they had opened at 11;00 am. I was greeted by a real grumpy dirty blonde haired girl that was not very friendly at all.....really at 11:00 am when they first open and already grumpy. Not how I like to be treated.  I have been going to red robin for the last 10+ years and was so excited when they opened this location. What I have noticed is that it keeps getting worse each time we come here. My family and I frequent this place less and less as the years go by. We try to think positive and try to give it another try to no avail that things are getting better because they are not. I was seated right away in the bar area in the very first both.I had a nice server who was also the bartender. What I ordered was the Hunk a burnin' love burger with the burger which I asked to be cooked med well. The burger was so mushy but I swallowed it down without complaining because I was so darn hungry. Oh and by the way the quality of the burgers has declined quite a bit and burgers are all now preformed to be a perfect circle. Me no like as they must be frozen and grilled that way. Huh.  I asked to get the spicy catsup and was given one tiny container full for two rounds of fries that I had ordered which was definetly not enough. I waited to see if they would offer me more and that never happened. I saw a little short guy go by which I am going to say was the manager in a light blue shirt. Passed me by not once,not twice not even three times but four times without asking me how things were going or how my meal was. This place is lacking of good management and service along with food quality. This is my last time going to this location as well as going to any other location.

My wife and I used to love Red Robin, and this one is really close to our house.  We haven't been there for about a year, since young kids are not always conducive to a great dining experience.  After tonight's visit, I feel like my four year-old could run this place better. We arrived around 6:30 on a Wednesday night.  Not exactly prime time.  There were plenty of open tables and we were sat pretty much right away and assured our server would be ""right with us.""  Twelve minute later, our server comes by for our drink order.  We let her know we were ready to order our food too, and placed our food order.  My wife got the Whisky River BBQ Chicken wrap, and I got the Tavern burger with mustard and pickles.  We ordered a corn dog and a milk shake for my son, and chicken tenders with milk for my daughter.  My wife also asked for some fries in advance (typical when we come here) to give the kids something to nibble on/distract them. This is when the wait starts.  We got our drinks a few minutes later, but our server told us something was preventing the shake from being ready (I'm not sure what the issue was).  Still no fries.  We wait some more, still nothing.  Finally, after about 20 minutes, our server brings the fries out, and then our food arrives 30 seconds later.  Lots of good those fries did.  When she came by, the server said the shake was still not ready and the manager would be comping it. Upon looking at my burger, I realized they did not include the mustard or pickles, so I waited another six minutes to flag down our server and let her know.  A few minutes later, she brought the mustard and pickles.  The burger was good, and my wife said her wrap was ""fine."" Our daughter then projectile vomited all over my wife, which we think was from the milk being old.  Hard to verify, but she isn't sick and was fine all night after we got home.   So my wife left with my daughter, and my son and I stayed behind to pay for the meal.  The manager finally comes by with the shake, assuring me we would not be charged for it.  This was pretty underwhelming, as it was a 99 cents children's milkshake.  How hard it is to mix some ice cream and milk.  I paid and left, vowing to never return to this location.  Seriously, don't bother.  There are plenty of great restaurants to go to around the mall.  Pick ANY other place and you'll have a better experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-gilbert?start=80,2.12,2.12,2.12,1.7000000000000002,2.12

As this is a burger joint I will rate it accordingly.  I will not compare it to Vintage 95.  This is a place to get a burger, maybe a salad, a brew if you are so inclined.  Nothing fancy.

The bonus in sitting outside is that it wasn't loud,  and wet could actually talk and hear each other. Win-win.  Service was prompt,  even being outside my water stayed filled.

Pepper and smoke: So salty, dad couldn't finish it. Royal red robin: this comes with a sunny-side up egg. I didn't realize when I ordered it that the patty was smaller than the ""special"" burgers on a different page. The patty was really thin, compared to everyone else's burger. When I ordered it medium-rare, I was told that the best they could do was medium. I was bummed,  but at least mine was cooked correctly. I was warned that the sunny-side up egg may be undercooked. It was. A big chunk of clear, uncooked egg white fell from the center as I bit into it.

I don't think that is too much to ask. We have 2 kids, so we used to frequent this place. We continued to get shoddy service and had toooonnnss of little annoyances, so we were glad when we found a sports bar/burger restaurant that our kids like even more. However, my in laws are in town and both my husband and his father were born on the same day, so we had two birthday burgers to use. It so wasn't worth it. We came in at 4:20 on a Saturday to try to beat the crowds. We were a party of 6, but were told that that the wait would be 30-40 minutes. What!? Ok. They got our name and phone number and we waited, and waited, and waited. I could see a dirty table for 6 empty and waited to be cleared off from the moment we walked in the door. It just sat. 50 ish minutes from the time we got there, I pull out my phone and see a text from Red Robin saying our table is ready from like 8 minutes before. What the heck. We were sitting RIGHT THERE. So I walk the 3 feet to the hostess and ask about it, and she says yes and shows us to our table. You know, the table that had been sitting there empty and dirty the entire time. Strike one and two. From there on it was little things. Our waiter was really nice, but we kept having to ask for things. Water and drink refills, reminders on sauces, new ketchup since the bottle on the table was empty, etc. The entire table had to share one knife. That sort of thing. Now the food. My side dish (broccoli) came out about 5 minutes after the rest was served. My burger bun was cold. My husbands entire burger and fries were cold. The meat was over cooked. My sons corn dog bites were so over cooked that they crunched in his mouth. The fries were really under done and all cold. All said and done, this place isn't cheap food, yet they don't care enough to make sure it's cooked properly. Don't even get me started about the POS kiosk they make you use to pay the bill. Try splitting a check and using a gift card with that sucker. It'll add an extra 20 minutes to your night. One more way Red Robin cuts corners to the detriment of their customers.

When the coupon was applied, it took it off the tavern burger instead of the entree. Our waiter did not come back for some time, so I asked a waitress who was going to process the same coupon for someone else about the issue. She came back and said the manager said it is an automatic discount and they have no control over it. The manager did not come over for several minutes, actually until I had already paid.  He apologized but stated he did not control the situation; he said he could not override it, actually after a long conversation admitting I was the first to complain that he was not going to override it.  He did say if he did 400 per month corporate would be asking why. The manager's name is Cody. He stated he is going to stand by his management team and not correct the bill.  I advised I would not be returning again and I would be sure to tell everyone one I knew about how this was handled.

With an average check of at minimum $25, your company lost the business of many more customers beyond me. I have no problem telling others about superior service and extremely poor service.

The pineapple on his was not grilled and tasted like the tin can it came out of.  My patty melt was grilled so long the rye bread was too hard to eat - just ate the insides and left the hard grilled rye on the plate.       After we about half way thru eating, our server check in to see if all was OK which was good.  The bathroom needed attention and the 'guy in charge' was ordering people around, but missing an awful lot of what was really needing his attention.        We will most likely try them again, everyone deserves a second chance.  They just need improvements in a few areas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-gilbert?start=20,2.56,2.32,2.32,2.504,2.416

I had read the other reviews in the last couple of months and was not sure what to expect, but we have no complaints with this Red Robin! The temperature inside the restaurant was chilly to me, but most AZ restaurants are! As for the little computer on the table, I'm not a fan, but so many other businesses have gone to them as well!

When our beers and food came out, our glasses were incredibly dirty. My burger was cold and raw (asked well). My wife didn't touch hers. Worse, though, was the hostess seating two elderly folks RIGHT beside of us at the bar. As soon they sat, they started complaining that I was having a beer! His wife was raising hell at him for letting them be sit at the bar, and when the waitress came by they demanded a table somewhere else. Why would a hostess set an elderly couple at the bar when maybe 1/4 of the restaurant was being used, other than to cause problems?

10,D V.,"Gilbert, AZ",243,408,213.0,5.0,2017-05-24,"We've been to this location a few times over the past few years.  This is our favorite dine in burger place.  Not sure why some of the bad reviews.  We have always gotten good service here.  Our most recent visit was for take-out on Mother's Day.   The food is always good, and hot, food looks appealing.  The prices are reasonable.  We noticed the last time we dined in, which was a few months ago, the decor of the place has changed to be more upscale, but the prices similar to last we remembered.   Loved that we were able to pay at the table electronically and didn't have to provide our server with our credit card.  Wish I remembered our server's name, but he was super personable and shared with us his favorite way to eat a burger we were ordering, which was to put an over easy egg on it.  That was super delish and unfortunately when doing take-out, you can't do this. We got refills on all our stuff that had refills and I think our server even refilled something that isn't normally refillable.  He shared with us some stuff that helped lower our bill but get the most bang for our buck.  That's watching out for your customers and considering them.  We never had to really wait for refills as our server was on top of things to the point things were getting refilled far too often. Of course, we were a fun, happy group (husband, wife, 2 teenage kids) and not obnoxious.  We were very kind and friendly, and left a really good tip.  Maybe to those who don't get good service, maybe it's their demeanor.  All our food every time we've been to Red Robin has always been sinfully good. Ordering online for Take Out was easy, too.  Our food was ready for us when we got there and it was still hot, though we got there about 15 minutes after they said the food would be ready, which was 13 minutes from order. When we arrived home another 15 minutes later, so guessing the food had been packed and ready for us for about 45 minutes before we finally were able to sit down at home to eat.  I ordered onion rings and these were the best onions rings ever.  I mean, we've had great onion rings before, but considering they had been sitting in the packed take out container for at least 45 minutes, one would expect that the onion rings would be limp and soggy.  On the contrary.  They were still crisp and delicious. In fact, our meal tasted and felt like it was served right from the kitchen immediately when we finally sat down to eat the food at home, and this was it being in take-out containers for AT LEAST 45 minutes.  Really, if you're in a hurry and don't want to wait for the lines you can sometimes get, try ordering Take Out online.   Anyway, for the poor reviews of this place.  Sorry.  That's not our experience.  Maybe we just got the right servers all the time, and came at the right times.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-gilbert,2.68,2.4,2.4,,2.512

I though the burger resembled something you would get from a fast food restaurant. It was pretty thin. I like that they have a gluten free bun. That's what made me add a third star. To be honest, the gluten free bun was the star of the meal. It was quite tasty for gluten free. My daughter scarfed down her mac and cheese, she said it was great. My sons cheese pizza looked pretty good, it's actually more of a loaf with sauce and cheese on it. The server was great. My daughters steak fries seemed a bit undercooked.

San Tan was very crowded with people leaving from some event that was over. Thought possibly there would be a wait time at Red Robin. When coming through the doors there wasn't anyone a head of us, but the hostess still asked for the name of our party/ phone # & that it would be about 15 mins until we could be seated. It was only about 3 mins. Started with the traditional wings which comes on a bed of chips. They were pretty good, yet seemed to be small in size. My husband ordered the Smoked Pepper Burger (A1 sauced) was good but pricey. I had the the Whiskey BBQ Burger ( Red Tavern). It's two very thin patties ( which would equal one) with a whisky BBQ sauce added with lettuce and tomato. It was just ok. Price was fair for what you get. It's a smaller burger than the Fire House Style yet for what you paid for that it's not a large burger either. Burgers range from $6.99 Tavern , Gourmet $8.99 then up to $13 for the Fire House. Only plus it's ordering the Fire House Style is you can get endless fries. Keep in mind that they come in a small round tin when served, then in a basket if you have another round, in our case, the 2nd order of fries took about 20 mins cause they were forgotten. If you order a side salad in place of any other side there is NO CHARGE!  At the table is an electronic devise that is a ""pay as you leave system"" when you are finish dinning. There is other functions & interactions on this machine. If you opt to play any games, you will be charged $1.99 or more depending on what you choose. Our server was ok, she had a great personality so we'll let  the flaw with the fries go. With that said, I doubt we will be back on the future.
