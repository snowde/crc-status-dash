343,Maria T.,"Glendale, Los Angeles, CA",0,2,,1.0,2012-02-15,"My fiancé and I had some light shopping to do and wanted a nice burger before heading home. I'm pregnant and was CRAVING fries and red robins are my favorite. But once we sat down at the bar, we knew our experience was going to be terrible. We are both in this industry, so we know what to expect when dining out and how we should be treated. First off, the older bartender Mike, took about 10 minutes to take our order, which seemed to be a big inconvenience to him. We had to ask for the bar to be cleaned, never got silverware, or refills. My fiancé got the quesadilla and I got just a regular cheeseburger. Mike kept wiping his nose and never once washed his hands and I watched him serve beer,glasses of wine, AND my finances sprite. DISGUSTING. We said please and thank u and never got a response from him. A server had brought back a martini that a guest didn't like and he made the biggest ordeal about it for nothing. I am a bartender and what the guest was asking for, which was for it to be colder, is about as simple as filling a glass of water. My fries I was craving was a child size handful, and when I asked for more, again, it seemed to be such an inconvenience. 10 minutes later, my Luke warm child sized handful of fries came. By this time, we were ready to go. Might I add, mike still never washed his hands. Mike was off doing whatever, and the server Derick came and cleared our plates and gave us our bill. I'd like to make a note that the 30 second experience we had with Derick was the only nice thing about our visit. Mike came and cashed us out, and we were off. There was absolutely no one in the place, I don't understand how our service was so bad. We will never come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glendale?start=340,3.04,3.04,3.04,2.6920000000000006,3.0400000000000005

267,Thy N.,"Olympia, WA",128,231,,5.0,2012-03-15,"I'm not a big fan of chains, but if I'm at a mall and have to choose something chainy, I'll choose Red Robin. For starters, it's consistent and the food is good - it's solid for what it is. Second, the service is outstanding. This place reminds me of my high school years up in Washington State where this chain originated. Red Robin was THE place to go to for birthday dinners and after football games. In the last 15-20 years, I've probably eaten the entire menu between here and Seattle. Some of my favorites: - Clucks and Fries, Buffalo Style - Red Robin Royal Burger - Banzai Burger - Crispy Chicken Tender Salad - Spinach Artichoke Dip I like to drown my fries in the Red Robin Seasoning. Yum. The mixed drinks are tasty but they're a bit stingy with the alcohol - probably to keep it a family-friendly place, which is totally understandable. The service is recognizably awesome. The staff is super nice and extremely attentive but not in the annoying way.

167,Hailey Z.,"Glendale, CA",301,626,508.0,3.0,2012-04-28,"This is Red Robin. Nothing spectacular can really be expected here. Food is good, service is always hit or miss. My past experience here wasn't fabulous but wasn't horrible either.  Came here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch, we were greeted, given a table and a high chair for my friends daughter. I know that the waitress we had was really busy, I was watching her and could tell that the amount of tables she had was a tad overwhelming, so for that, I can cut her some slack. She was nice and you could tell she was really trying to make everyone happy. Can't complain about that.  I ordered the blackened chicken sandwich, fries and I got a side salad with ranch. My friend ordered the buffalo chicken fingers and salad, and a corn dog and fries for her daughter off the kids menu. The chicken sandwich I got was mediocre, I wouldn't get it again. I enjoyed the buffalo chicken tenders more than my meal. I was disappointed that our salads weren't at our table before our meal though, like we had asked. Again, waitress was overly busy so I wasn't going to complain.  She brought the check and forgot to order a to go order we were taking home to a friend of ours. I had to remind her of that, she was very apologetic, and of course I understood and reminded her that I know shes very busy which I think relieved her. I waited around while my friend took her daughter next door to Target while I paid for us. I asked for change and instead she charged all of it to my bill and brought that change. Ugh. Maybe I wasn't thorough though, so I had to tell her that the change I wanted was so I could pay for my share. She was very quick to give me all of the change and I put my cash in and gave my friends card to pay for her share. In counting the change back, I realized that she had short changed me $20.  Waitress came back with the to go order and the bill. Before I could even tell her about the $20, she opened the bill up and told me that I had accidentally put the $20 in there. I really appreciated that as I must have done that by accident, as I know that most people wouldn't risk their jobs for an extra $20, and I let her know that it wasn't a problem, I just appreciated that she was very quick to point it out and it made me feel bad that I think she thought I would complain about her regarding the ordeal. If anything I wanted to let a manager know how hard I saw her working to please all the tables she was waiting on and had a good attitude while doing it. I would definitely come back here during a less hectic time to try another dish. The waitress we had was pleasant, and from what I could tell, so were all the other ones on the floor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glendale?start=160,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.9240000000000004,3.2800000000000002
292,Lily T.,"Los Angeles, CA",25,44,,4.0,2012-04-29,"I never thought I would ever eat at a Red Robin, and this one in particular, because when I was a child we were at this mall and the Red Robin mascot stalked us all the way to the other side!  (In hindsight, I can almost talk myself into believing the person had just gotten off work and was heading to their car, but then I remember that he/she was in costume the entire length of the mall, so there was definitely something sinister going on :/)  But my friend and I were both craving burgers, and she wanted to eat at a Red Robin.  I looked up the menu online and it wasn't too bad so I decided to give it a try. She got the mushroom burger (something 'Shroom?) and I got the Bleu Ribbon burger.  Hers looked gross hahahahaha.  Granted, it didn't look all too appetizing on the website, but it looked a lot worse in person, I couldn't even look at it while I was eating :D.  On the other hand, mine was awesome :D.  I asked for medium well, and while I don't know enough to be able to tell if it was actually medium well, it wasn't overcooked (the first time I ever ordered a non-fast food burger I asked for ""VERY well done"" and it could've been used as a hockey puck) or undercooked (to me that means it doesn't look raw and definitely no oozing blood if I poked at it).  I loved how they cooked the onions (I don't really like onions, especially raw), I think they called it onion straws, they were like thinner and more lightly battered versions of onion rings.  The bun it was on was also really good, it was nice and soft too, definitely felt and tasted fresh. Our server was nice, he came by quite often to ask how everything was, but in a very polite manner that didn't make you want to scream ""stop bothering us!"" (I've had waiters who would refill your glass every time you drank more than an inch from the rim -______-  made me feel like they just wanted to eavesdrop on the conversation). They also had unlimited fries!  I didn't know that until the server asked if we wanted more fries, but by that time I was pretty stuffed.  I think the fries had more of a wedge shape (I prefer my fries in a stick shape lol, they just feel more like fries that way), I don't remember much else about them because I drenched them in ketchup :D, though I don't think they were dry, because no amount of ketchup can save fries that are dry.  Next time I'm going to eat all my fries first and get refills :D. I definitely want to eat at Red Robin again, if only to confirm this experience wasn't a fluke.  I want to try a chicken sandwich next time, and their cod sandwich too (I can't decide if it sounds delicious or if it sounds like a bad idea :D - it might be a better idea to just get fish and chips).  I also want to try their Cobb salad (I love Cobb salad), but I don't know if it's a good idea to get salad at a restaurant that prides itself on burgers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glendale?start=280,3.4,3.4,3.4,3.056,3.4000000000000004

The Birthday burger is only supposed to be offered for eat-in but he said that he would make an exception as long as we had the barcode from the promotional email to scan.  I wasn't sure if my friend had his coupon but I accepted and ordered anyway. When we arrived at Red Robin, I spoke with Zachary at the bar/to go pick-up, where our order was already ready.  Zachary was the worst! My friend handed over his red robin card. For some reason it didn't go through and Zachary didn't offer us a discount (which, okay fine), but he didn't even seem apologetic.  Then, after pouring my lemonade into a to-go cup, he set it down RIGHT in the middle of a bunch of spilled juice that was there before we came. I brought it to his attention and told him that I needed a new cup.  He didn't apologize or even acknowledge that what he'd done was an error. WTH man! Learn some manners and CLEAN YOUR STATION! Had he done that beforehand, this wouldn't have been an issue. Not to mention that he had placed our to-go back in said mess before we arrived, my friend moved it as soon as we got there.  Messy ass bartender.  And rude to boot.

So we were on vacation and we were looking for a place that was decent and great for kids, so I suggested Red Robin's and this one was near our hotel. We got there and was seated right away. Our waitress was very friendly and served us promptly. We were all full and stated how good the burgers were. It was not until we got our check that our entire experience went down the drain. There was a bus-boy who was clearing a table right next to us. I look up and the bus-boy who was chewing tobacco spit directly into the bucket that he was collecting the dishes in. Then part of my other party said that they saw him do it again. Needles to say I have never been so disgusted in my life. We told our waitress and she asked if we would like to tell her manager. The manager came over, we told her. She just looked kind of puzzled and left our table. She never returned back to our table to say anything further about the situation. However our waitress did return just to say that the manager would speak to the bus-boy. While we were waiting for our change, we proceeded to get dirty looks for other waitress' as if we broke some sort of code for telling on this person. I will never frequent another Red Robin again.

Food: This is a burger joint but they also sell other things bedsides burgers, like sandwiches, salads, etc. The burgers are your typical restaurant burgers. They aren't amazing but they're also not terrible.  The patties are semi tasty and the fries are pretty good. I think they give you refills with your fries, so that's a plus.

I have no complaints with the wait staff here, if anything during my last visit the waiter was a bit too attentive, but that is fine with me, at least he's doing his job.

I love their juicy burgers, especially veggie options for burgers.  The friendly host seated us right away. Tonight when I ordered, I forgot which veggie burger I loved more, the veggie or vegan. I chose the veggie one at first and was totally wrong. I felt really bad that I did not like it, I rarely ever order the wrong item, and told our server April. She was absolutely sweet and sympathetic, right away she said it was not a problem and asked me what I would like to try instead. I told her the boca vegan burger and right away she got my order. The whole night she took care of us with a smile. April thank you for being so nice, my favorite server now! As for my burger, the boca vegan burger was juicy and delicious. The difference, so I will remember, is that the veggie has a dry quinoa rice texture with cheese and the vegan patty is bigger and has no cheese, but a creamy sauce.

My sons food (kids pizza and fruit) came rather quickly but as for mine and my friends, it took a long long long time. We had already went through two refills and didn't understand why our food was taking so long. I told my friend ""do you think she forgot to bring us our food and it's probably just sitting under heat lamps?""  He waved the server down and when she saw him, she knew ""oh ya there food!!""  So she went to the kitchen and came back with our food that was obviously under heat lamps. The fries were under my fish and they were cold but the top of my fish were hot. So needless to say, the fries were gross. My fish were very greasy and mushy. My friends avocado burger had a smidgen of avocado which we found to be disappointing since it's an Avocado Burger. As we were eating our waitress never came back, just like she disappeared as we were waiting for our food. We had to ask another server for ranch and other stuff we needed. She finally came back to give me a box and check and once again she disappeared. Had the manager run my card and we left.

This restaurant location has kind of a strange lay out structurally which I imagine can't make it very easy for the servers when it gets busy. Luckily it wasn't busy so service was no issue. My friend ordered the BBQ wrap ($10), My brother got the Chicken Bruschetta sandwich on Ciabatta ($12.50) & I got the Simply Chicken sandwich ($9). They both opted for bottomless steak fries & I tried to be healthier and got the ""fruit"" salad. My friend loves the wrap & ordered it without ranch and honey mustard on the side... I clearly heard him say this but his wrap came with the ranch on it, which if you are trying to be healthier you know that ranch instantly makes the sandwich 2X as bad for you. Anyway my friend is too nice and didn't want to complain/have it sent back... that doesn't mean I can't put it on yelp though right?! Our server was nice and everything else service wise was fine besides this.  My brother loved his chicken bruschetta sandwich, and the steak fries were good and the waitress kept them coming. My sandwich was simple and good, just what I wanted, however the fruit salad was very forgettable and anything but fresh. If I had known it was basically out of the can I would have just gotten the fries heads up to those of you debating getting the fruit salad here. This is a good spot to stop for a chicken sandwich or a burger if you are ok with spending $15 per person. We enjoyed most of our food some minor issues but overall fine casual dining experience.

Well, the container they put them in doesn't have a bottom, but the important part is that you can eat as many of these beautiful steak fries as you want.  I started coming here often after my daughter fell in love with her kids meal: corn dog, mandarin oranges, and chocolate milk. Whenever we're at the Glendale Galleria, she would request to eat here, and each time we do, we've never had a horrible experience. My biggest complaint is that there is no reception here (I'm on Verizon).  Their burgers are good. I've had their: Regular Red Robin Burger/Keep it Simple - simple. Not really special, as it's your typical burger that you can get at most burger joints.  Red's Double Tavern Burger - close to their regular, but with 2 patties/cheese. Their tavern sauce is similar to thousand island.  They also have a burger with 2 patties that's a dollar cheaper than their regular burger, but the double patties burger is smaller than their regular.  Royal Red Robin - the burger with the egg on top. If you like runny yolk, then yum! Burning Love - their burger with jalapenos, on jalapeno roll and such. I wish it was more spicy, but it's a good choice. Bonzai - yum yum. I love teriyaki and pineapple. This is one of my faves.  Guacamole bacon - typical California burger. It's great with chicken.  They have a variety of sauces you can get, and some of them are at no additional cost. I love dipping my fries in their Thai chili sauce, and the financee/bf loves dipping them in the tavern sauce. Free sauce! Better than McDonalds charging for extra charges, ha.  Feel free to customize your orders. You can opt out of fries and get something healthier, such as broccoli or fruit, but not all sides are bottomless/unlimited as the fries are.  The people that work here are very nice. We were able to get seated promptly each time, and none of our food came out wrong. They did forget my daughter's chocolate milk a couple times, but no biggie.

The Whiskey river burger is one of their classic staples & it's so good. I love how they have added several new dipping sauces to their menu. I got to try a few & the bacon one really stood out to me with their bottomless seasoned fries. I know it's a burger place but their fried fish & chips are so good here. I almost always get it to share with whoever I'm with. The Cod fish is fresh & battered correctly. The Freckled Lemonade is another favorite of mine as is the bottomless root beer floats.

He says good evening ladies and was about to walk away when I said 'sorry but is anyone going to help me'? He say I told you Steven will help you-Steven at the Bar and I told you 3 times' pointing his 3 fingers out to me!!! OMG!!!! Really? I said 'u never said to go to the bar'.As if I know who Steven is!!! Bad customer service. I was treated very poorly and felt like I was a NO body just because I was taking out and not dining in.

Last night me and my boyfriend were running errands around the Glendale Galleria and decided we'd splurge on a sit down dinner at Red Robin. Both of us have had good experiences with this establishment (not necessarily this location)  In order to bypass the wait we sat in the bar area, we didn't have a drink menu so we made our food selections first and when the waiter came by we ordered our food and a drink menu.  I got a ""sand in my shorts"" and Jerred got a Blood Orange Margarita, both were delicious, however I wish I had savored it more. We placed out orders roughly at 7:30... At 8:50 ONE AND A HALF HOURS LATER we FINALLY received our food, after watching several customers get up and leave without getting anything. I had ordered a chicken sandwich with a side salad, Jerred had ordered a burger (which they had to downgrade to a petite because they didn't have the normal sized patties) note to restaurants, if you don't have the requested item, upgrade them for free.  Needless to say we were starving when the food finally arrived. Jerred ordered the second round of his bottomless fries immediately, unsure of how long those would take.  After eating our meals entirely and waiting ANOTHER 15 minutes, our waiter somehow managed to make it to our table to say that the fries would be a little longer. We took the check.  The restaurant didn't seem super busy, and I get that sometimes this happens, but after all that j expected a comped drink, or a dessert sent out way (not that I would have wanted to wait for it) no dice. Just a ""visit us again soon, guys"" as our waiter shrunk bank to the kitchen in what I hope was shame. Needless to say I will NOT be coming back.

227,Kenneth S.,"Glendale, CA",45,98,9.0,2.0,2015-02-09,"Not worth it. I took my family to Red Robin yesterday, and the two stars are for the friendly service. I ordered a Gardenburger with green chili and pepper jack. For almost ten bucks, the burger was on the small side. It tasted OK. The bottomless fries -- well, they start you with a small amount. They tasted fine. No one ever offered to bring more, although I'm sure they would have if we'd asked. My wife got a Gardenburger and asked for the ""freckled fruit"" on the side. We asked our server why it was called freckled fruit, and she said she had no idea, maybe the strawberry seeds? It didn't matter, because they messed up and brought her fries instead of the fruit. My son got a kid's grilled cheese with that infamous ""freckled fruit,"" which turned out to be a tiny little ramekin of mushy-looking fruit. Was it compote or fresh fruit? Couldn't tell, and my son didn't want to touch it. Our Cokes were $2.79 each -- only order those if you plan to drink a lot of it! (And yes, they did bring us refills promptly throughout the meal.) Overall, the food at Red Robin is edible, but the prices are verging on too high for what you get. For my money, I'd say Islands has better food when you're out looking for a burger.

85,Anastasia B.,"Los Angeles, CA",139,23,5.0,1.0,2015-03-23,"Taken aback by the lack of customer service at this location. Our visit started out okay; we didn't wait long to be seated and our server, ERIKA, was prompt to ask for our drink/food order. It all started going downhill once we got our food. I ordered the bruschetta chicken burger and it was inedible. The chicken inside my sandwich was chewy and rubbery. I've never had anything like it. So gross! I took it upon myself to let the server know (because she never asked) that the chicken had a rubbery texture and asked if she could sub it out for a beef patty instead. She sort of just took my plate back without really addressing the situation, which is fine because it really wasn't her fault. What struck me as odd, though, was that she never once took it upon herself to check in with our table while we waited for her to replace my rubber chicken burger. My boyfriend and I just split his burger and fries while we waited, but we eventually ran out of fries and just sat there for a few minutes with an empty plate. Our server never came by to ask if we needed more fries, nor did she stop by to ask if we needed a refill on our drinks. She actually walked right past our table a couple of times without ever acknowledging us. Eventually, my boyfriend flagged her down so that we could order more fries. By the time she came back with the fries, she had my burger with her. She sort of just dropped everything off without saying anything. The chewy chicken was never addressed and we were never, throughout our entire visit, asked if our food was okay. Not. Even. Once. I've worked at restaurants before and I know that you're supposed to check in with your tables frequently to ask how everything is tasting and to offer refills. This never happened for us. Everything was on us. We were never asked if we needed a drink refill. We were never asked if we needed more fries (they're bottomless). We were never asked how our food was tasting. We had to ask. Erika seemed completely indifferent, bored even. Pretty sure she knew we were upset, but she really couldn't care less. Maybe it was her last day and she just stopped caring?

We (party of 3) were sat in the back in one of the smaller booths. My husband is not a small guy (6'1"", muscular build), and I had to squeeze next to him as my brother sat across from us. Whatever.

116,Frank Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,37,8.0,4.0,2015-07-10,"Red Robin has always been great - but the server usually disappears once your food has arrived. I always suspected the bottomless fries to be the culprit. It seems like they would intentially hide so that you wouldn't ask them for fries after you've finished the first five they serve with your meal. Your server will be prompt and friendly in taking your order and will hide out while you eat. Once you've finished they are back again to ask if you'd like dessert, as if they were hiding and watching from afar.  However, service was definitely MUCH better tonight. I'm not sure if our waitress Bianca was new, or if there was a change in policy. She was very nice and helpful right from the start. Gave some good recommendations on the menu (by the way, the garlic fries are just fries with garlic ground onto them but they taste so much better). For the first time, we were checked in on every so often to make sure everything was OK. She offered to bring fries before we even thought of asking - I was astonished.  As for the food, great as usual... I think. I'm not sure if the D.G.B. burger is supposed to be served in a puddle of its own grease. The bottom bun was definitely soaked through and the arugula leaves were dripping - but it still tasted great. As I mentioned, the garlic fries are worth the upgrade especially if you ask for a side of garlic aioli.  I always drop by every now and then but if the service continues to be anything like what Bianca has shown us tonight, I will definitely be eating here more often!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glendale?start=80,2.48,2.73,2.73,2.768,2.63

Yesterday 7/13 was just a big miss.  The onion bun I always get was unsually hard. It was strange and off putting. It felt like maybe it was stale, someone zapped it in the microwave for a few seconds and then maybe forgot about it. By the time it reached me it was rock solid. Like I jabbed it with a fork and the fork got stuck. It had the consistency of a thick cracker.  I also always ask for my fries extra crispy and usually they come out perfect as requested. Yesterday I found a nearly raw fry in my order, very limp and undercooked and the opposite of what I asked for.  Usually I'd get an extra helping but was so put off by the meal I didn't bother.  Our server was fine if a bit over worked. I almost complained but did not want to bother him.   We initially came in that night because of a free dessert with purchase special.  Then our dessert (a lemon cake) came out frozen.

It's a saturday night and they are fully staffed but there's a line of people waiting to be seated with empty tables all around us. We ended up just grabbing a table at the bar. They have these new tablets at each table that you can ""order"" from... except you can only order appetizers, re-order of the same bar drink, and desserts. Kind of pointless. I ordered the skinny margarita which I have had before and it was so good then. Well after sitting 10 minutes at the bar before getting delivered to my table, I get it and it's the worst margarita ever. We use the ""super cool"" table to call over a waitress and she comes and before I can even tell her what's wrong with it, she says ""Oh it's too tart, right?""... so you KNOW this drink is bad, yet you still serve it? So I ordered a Coors light and she brings a Carona... whatever.  THEN we are waiting FOREVER for our food and the waitress brings my wrap and tells us that the printer wasn't working by the grill so the burger is going to be a while... You know because the cooks literally just thought they weren't getting any burger orders... at a burger place.  10 minutes after my food arrives, cold, his arrives not cooked the way he wanted and he said it was not good.

We came to celebrate a birthday but she made the experience awful thanks for that. We had a couple people join us after and it took them 20 minutes to get their drinks again no exaggeration. The waitress finally seemed to care when I started talking to the manager. I'm a server and a manager at a restaurant so I'm very understandable and patient but this was just terrible. Our orders came out all wrong too and it was cold and fries were stale. The only person who seemed to help us and cared was the male host. We planned on getting dessert for my husbands birthday but after food taking 30 minutes and hardly any attention from our server we skipped it. She couldn't even get us the napkins we asked for. They need to not hire inexperienced servers because they are going to lose customers that way. I was 9 months pregnant and tackling the whole restaurant serving by myself with no complaints from any table. If she can't handle a few tables with basic needs then you guys need better servers. Never coming back again. ----my mom paid for dinner she just checked her bank statements and she got charged twice!!! Really?!

When we got our appetizer  (pretzel bites are dry and the cheese is gross) the plate I got was unclean. The all American patty melt was nothing special (or even okay).

Obvious ploy to try and save on labor costs. Kiosks are convenience when paying if they would work properly. Have gone a couple times and it has only worked properly once. Two times it was out of paper, one time it would not read my rewards card and apply the appropriate discount. If you're going to introduce new technology, make sure it works. Maybe this place needs some new management to return it to the restaurant it once was. Food is still good and unlimited fries are appreciated, even though the initial side of fries they bring you are considerably smaller than before since they use a small metal ring to supposedly improve the astethic look of the burger when it arrives.

My sister and I have lighter appetites, so this was the perfect size to share. Nana-Nana Moo-Moo Classic Milkshake:  This is a banana and chocolate milkshake.

142,Bryan G.,"Alhambra, Los Angeles, CA",127,33,8.0,2.0,2015-12-27,"Went to this location for dinner on a Saturday night. Being the day after Christmas we excepted it to be pretty busy and were prepared for a wait. When we arrived the hostess told us it would be approximately 20 minutes. 20 minutes is a fairly short time for a Saturday for a party of three. 10 minutes later a server comes by and discusses with her about open tables, which lead to us being seated. We then over bearded the server discussing the arrangement of the tables and were switched servers but were never notified.  Honestly I don't care about being notified I just would like to know who I need to flag down because the entire night it felt like we had to keep playing where's Waldo because she never brought anything to our table. Starting with ordering food and then asking for utensils and napkins once they brought our appetizer which should be a given. I mean we only ordered the onion rings but at least bring us some freakin' napkins. She passed by several times and could clearly see what was on our table because we were in front of the kitchen, but she just seemed so ignorant and blind as to what we needed. Other workers were more helpful with refills. It was not only the server but the kitchen as well because I order medium for my burger and my girlfriend order medium-well, and both our burgers were burnt on the edges are were extremely dry. We felt sick after eating those burgers but we were waiting 30 mins for our food that we were just staring, after am approximately 50 minute wait period from the moment we walked in. I guess the overall timing on when we arrived was bad because it was just about 90 minutes before closing but I feel like there should be no excuse for the way the food should be cooked. As far as the waitress, I would rather wait an additional 20 minutes for a table, then to be seated early and receive A has ass service, with a waitress who seems to try to avoid our tables which is right in front of the kitchen (That table being the easiest to accommodate for since everything is so close). I do not hold this against the store or the establishment of Red Robins because there burgers have always been good, but I'm just very disappointed that someone could receive such a unsatisfying burger and service from a Red Robins...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glendale?start=140,2.72,2.47,2.956,2.2800000000000002,2.5700000000000003

We didn't have to wait long at all for our food, which was delicious. I had the chicken tortilla soup, and it was fantastic.

79,Desiree C.,"Glendale, CA",4,13,,1.0,2016-01-11,"It takes a lot for me to simply mark a one star review for a restaurant but honestly, if I could I would give it no stars. There's a considerable amount wrong with the Galleria Red Robin and I'll try my best to highlight specifics. Red Robin is usually just meant for me as a last resort. I used to go to the Fresno Red Robin all the time as a ""fancy sit down"" meal option in high school. The service is always an average to skimming below average at the Fresno/Clovis Red Robins. Food quality wise, I always order the pineapple teriyaki burger and the last few times I went, the bun was drenched in teriyaki that it was impossible to hold together. This was the same story at the Galleria Red Robin too, maybe there's a flaw in the recipe or the mere stacking of the burger itself. But I digress, I went here a couple days before Christmas because I had relatives from out of town in LA that wanted to eat close-by in Glendale for my mother's birthday. Considering it was the holidays, my family wasn't prepared for the 2 hour waits in restaurants around the area near the Americana. The only option was a seemingly smaller wait time at the Galleria Red Robin but I was sorely, sorely mistaken. I'm not sure where to begin about my experience here.  First, in summary, the hostess was incredibly rude. An odd vibe lingered around her similar to an air of ill-precieved self-appointed superiority from the hostess to over all the various families with their different party numbers, waiting to be seated in a hunger induced dazed after possibly skipping lunch. These families were ultimately at the mercy of the hostess and she abused that power by attempting to seat different families ahead of families that came before those seated. It was not only annoying to see those before my own family who were waiting a lot longer get passed up with a family of similar party size needing to be seated.   Second, after standing for the first 30 minutes and watching the families be seated first. I began to notice the way that certain parties were seated. You know that game Diner Dash and how the 2 party characters will typically be seated in a 2 party booth to get bonus points or something like that? If so or if not, the point is that there were just 2 people taking up a booth capable of holding a party of 8. The lack of... I guess what could it be referred to? Table seating strategy? Whatever it is, it was the same story. Big booths holding just 2 people where there were little tables throughout the restaurant that could have easily accommodated the much smaller 2 people party sizes.  I stayed optimistic. Maybe my impression of the Galleria Red Robin had gotten off to an bad start. Then another 30 minutes passed and another... about an 1 and a half into my wait time, I began to observe a little more about the function of this Red Robin. The tables that sat the parties of 2 began to clear and I anticipated having the my family's party of 7-8 people to be sat. Another 30 minutes pass and we've hit the 2 hour wait time. The tables weren't cleared off and the dirty dishes sat there as another 20-30 minutes were tacked on until a table cleaner? Busboy? I'm not sure what to call the staff member that clears off tables. He finally cleared off the tables in a very agitated, purposely slow manner, throwing a few annoyed huffs there and side glances here to the families waiting outside the area. Third, the manager had to intervene. In hopes that the management intervening would fast-track our wait time, once again... we were mistaken. Another 15 minutes tacked onto our wait time. My mother had to take a more assertive tone in requesting a table. We get sat down. The server has noticed the ""trouble"" we've caused the management and hostess. Proceed to eat in an awkward vibe that comes with also having your waiter throw really off-putting attitude towards everyone by having her take a really abrasive tone when answering questions and placing orders. We get our meals after 40 mins. Get the check done in another 20 and by the time we were out, it was really late at night. Somewhere after 9. It was one of the most single-handedly weird and awful dining experiences I've ever had in my life. But please, for those who've made it this far in my review. I don't want you to think that my family are those people that purposely cause disruptions in restaurants and will seek out to make any restaurant staff member's life, while serving us, a living hell. It's never been like that. They're actually incredibly patient and thoroughly enjoy leaving huge holiday tips because they all understand what it's like to have to deal with customers. However, keep in mind the potential quality of service you might receive here at this particular Red Robins in the Glendale Galleria.

So we went and we were very excited since it was our first time. We got immediately served by a waitress and she sat us down and when we did I noticed there was a fork on the floor.  I was like ok, and we didn't think much of it.  Then the server asked what would we like, so we ordered and I wanted to try the regular fries and the garlic fries for an extra .99... We agreed. We got the fries and the regular ones were so stale and nasty. The garlic fries lacked flavor. We ordered another batch of both of them and they came back the same. We were waiting and we decided to play the free games they had on the screens, and we were unaware that they charge you $2 for games. (Always read the fine print!)  Our waitress walked by and she didn't ask if we wanted refills or napkins, as a matter of fact she didn't ask how we were doing and what we needed!!! We also had the light to signal a waitress/waiter and they all kept walking by. I eventually found the waitress and asked her if she can get me more water and when she came back, she spilled the water on me, and said oops, sorry. It got me furious and pissed off. It looked like she wanted to laugh and I had to honestly keep my cool about this. She didn't look like she wanted to work, because she was in the back just talking to an older man.  We brought this to the managers attention and a middle aged Asian lady came by to see what was going on and then she said she was going to come back but never did. Instead a man named Sherwin came by and he said he was the manager and he was going to attend to us here on out. We were grateful for him helping us, we got a 7-8 dollar discount including removing the game charge and we were out of there.  Although Sherwin helped us out and he was nice and patient about it all,  This will be our first and last time that we will be there. Very bad waitresses.

I get my food, cut the burger in half and start eating. I notice what I thought was mushrooms under my grilled onions. I pulled them out because I don't like them. I keep eating. I get to the second half and find black beans, weird, I pull them out and keep eating. Henry at this point took my son to the restroom. I finish eating and then thought about how some vegans have mentioned finding meat in their food and I freeze. I think, ""No, someone couldn't have possibly done that to me..."" I inspect the beans and stuff I had pulled out and sure enough I found a chunk of ground beef. What. The. Fuck. Seriously?? I immediately call over the server and told him and he looked mortified!! He ran off and told a kitchen manager. He comes over and I explain and he is apologetic and says that never should have happened and that he would take it off the bill. I sit there and it just starts bugging me more and more. Henry comes back and I tell him what happened. He is instantly pissed (he's 90% vegan). As I talk to him it bugs me more and more and my server comes back and I tell him that I'm really upset because I could have been allergic to meat or something and that they don't know why I have dietary restrictions. He said he would let them know again. This time the manager comes by and I explain what happened and that its fucked up to do that to someone and that many vegans get very sick after eating meat because we don't have the enzymes to digest it anymore. He asks what he can do to make it better. And I told him I wasn't trying to get free food out of it, that I just wanted to make sure this wouldn't happen to someone else. He said that he understood and that someone was going to be leaving his kitchen. That there were only 4 guys that handled the Boca burgers and allergen section. He said whether accidental or not it was unacceptable and that they were opening an investigation. He said a manager was already on the phone with corporate in the back and that I could have the number to corporate so that I could follow up. I took the card and you better believe I'll be calling to follow up.  whether you're vegan or not it's not right to fuck with someone's food. What if I was allergic to something (like peanuts) and someone snuck it in there to be mean and I ended up having an allergic reaction and had to go to the hospital or I died?!

Our official waiter was supposed to be working the other side and, while he was enthusiastic and friendly, we almost never saw him. The two women who were working on our side of the restaurant didn't seem to notice we were looking for help, and never looked over to check. On a couple occasions, I had to walk over to them to ask them for service which, while I don't mind doing so, seemed like it should not have been needed since ethe restaurant was not especially busy (at leats on the side I was sitting on).  I didn't think the food took very long to arrive, but the woman from the kitchen seemed to think so. She let me know that my food was cooked the way I'd asked, but then proceeded to let me know that my order was why it 'took so long.' Which, while I understand was likely an accurate explanation, seemed to be an unneeded rude comment since it mainly just heavily implied that my order had been an inconvenience to her. I know she may not have been super excited to be there; some days in a restaurant are tough, but I always hate to see it taken out on a customer.

Today I got a server who I've never seen there before and I can't even Remember her name but anyways the food was good as she gave okay service  ! When it came time to pay I paid on the little tablet they have at the table I swiped my debit card and left her 9 dollars tip cash ! My five year old nephew had to use the restroom around the same time so As his mom walked him over I switched to her side to watch her newborn ! As they were coming back My newborn nephew started to get fussy so we made a quick exit as not to disturb other guest  who were eating ! About 5-6 hours later I get a fraud alert for 345 dollars for Victoria secret online ! So I quickly get up to look for my purse to search for my debit card ! I couldn't find it and from  red Robbins I went straight home no stops in between ! So I call the red robins  to ask if maybe they have it recorded ! Lo and behold they have no video cameras in the dinning room ! Now here's what bothers me I work at a low budget diner that has cameras  pointing in every direction but your going to tell me that a red robins in the Glendale galleria has no cameras !!!!  The manager than tells me maybe someone passed by and took it !!  But wait I left her a 9 dollar tip right by where I left it ! I'm sure she saw her tip as a server I know we stay on top of our tips ! And if someone were to pass buy and take it why not try and use it at the 200  plus stores at the  galleria I'll tell you why because the dumb b*#^{h  had to wait till she got off work and by that that time the galleria stores were closed and why not use it safely at home where no cameras will catch her  !!

Today was a different occasion though. We came in to satisfy mom's craving and celebrate my mom's birthday. We were seated in less than 10 minutes. Our server seemed really nice but quite stressed. While eating I noticed his manager or superior getting mad at him and talking to him without taking him to the back. It was very obvious and we felt really bad. Half way through dinner I mentioned to my server that it was moms birthday if they could sing to her. He agreed in a nicely matter. He took quite a bit to come by but it didn't bother us. He then came to us and brought my mother her little complimentary dessert and apologized because his coworkers didn't want to sing along with him. I felt really bad for him. I think it all had to do with his manager and that incident. This was very disappointing because incidents behind the dining area shouldn't affect customers. I don't blame our server.

The servers were sweet and friendly, and never gave us any attitude for continously asking for condiments and they were always attentive.  I love their concept of bottomless steak fries (i love potato) and that their burgers are so gourmet but also comfort-food styled.

I am giving a 3 star rating cause this only happened once out of the many times I have come here after the incident occurred. Which they have been absolutely terrific, and amazing since, plus, I have not seen this server since the incident so I am hoping he was fired or something. This is what happened:  Now every server I get at this location is great and very friendly, except for one. We were seated in a booth closer to the bar, and at first had a pretty decent server. He took our drink orders and when he came back to take our food orders, he was EXTREMELY rude to only me but not to my father or boyfriend(Sexist?).  Here is how it went down: He looked at my father first and said ""Hey man what can I get you, Sir?"" of course being very friendly, then my boyfriend saying ""alright boss, your turn. What can I get you?""  Then it was my turn.  He will barely even looked me in the eye and said ""what do you want?""  I turned and said ""I would like the crispy chicken sal-"" he cuts me off and said ""what dressing?"" I turn and say ""may I please have 2 cups of Italian Dressing, oh and please no bacon on the sal-"" he cuts me off, says ""K"" turns to my father and boyfriend and says ""your food will be here shortly guys"" ignores me and leaves. Now, I have religious beliefs that prevent me from eating bacon and the salad I was ordering had bacon on it, so I was hopeful that he understood that I didn't want it on the salad.  About 10 minutes later the food is here. However I had a HUGE scoop of bacon right on top of the salad. I tell him I asked for no bacon, again he made no eye contact and he just grabbed my plate and walked away. I get my salad back, with no bacon. Finally. I ate my salad. All was fine. Until I needed a drink refill. I said I would like Diet Coke. He leaves and then he brings Sprite. I said Diet Coke. He leaves and brings Dr. Pepper. I said Diet Coke. He leaves and after 10min I realize he isn't bringing me a Diet Coke. I go to the hostess who was glad to get me my actual order.  After all of this. We were set to leave.

75,Cristina Z.,"Glendale, CA",0,11,6.0,1.0,2017-05-14,"My family and I visited Red Robin on 3-12-17, and we had the worst possible experience. We visit this location pretty often, but after this visit I do not think we will return. I usually do not like to name individuals, but unfortunately it was the people that made it horrible for us. Our waitress Giselle seemed to lack the skills needed to waiter, she wouldn't pay attention nor would she write down the order to be able to deliver it correctly. We asked for two cocktails, we received a margarita over ice when we initially asked for a blended one, then when she took that back they just blended it not considering the ratio between the alcohol strawberry and ice(water). This left the drink absolutely diluted in water. Same with the second drink, the coke was so much it couldn't be considered a cocktail.  After we ordered, it took around 40 minutes for the food to be served, one of the entrees was a burger which was requested to have the bun ""double/triple toasted""(exact words used) for it to be crispy, it was delivered with a bun not toasted at all. A salad we requested to have iceberg lettuce not romaine lettuce was delivered with romaine, even though our waitress assured us she would allow the cooks to know. [Understand the requests we made are due to health reasons, even though that should not matter] We made our concerns and complaints known to the individuals helping us. This led to the manager taking over, she too was unprofessional and rude. She basically explained that the salads are not fresh and are tossed out of a bag into a plate that they could not replace the lettuce, instead she gave us the opportunity to choose another salad, which we did... during this time to wait another random waiter.. came to take the burger with the non toasted bun away to replace it with the salad we just ordered. This was even worse because it goes to show the team lacks communication. The salad was replacing a salad, not the burger!!!!! We asked for the manager's name but we were never answered. Honestly, we are at a loss for words when it comes to describing how horrible our visit here was.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-glendale?start=60,2.88,2.86,2.852,2.724,2.868

Then we sat down ad realized they're basically short staffed. I'll give them a chance, no need to judge right? Well this was not the case when I got my food. I tried to be fair but my food was over cooked and dry. Burgers are the specialty right? They should know how to cook burgers! And the fries were overly done. Hard and dry! Even the extra order!
