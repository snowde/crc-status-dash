Ingredients were fresh, and the burger itself was tasty. Lots of menu choices - I only wish the pretzel bun was a regular choice. Most of all we were impressed with the cleanliness of the restaurant. Perhaps because it was relatively new, it was not very busy at the beginning of the lunch ""hour"". Waitress was attentive, honestly friendly, and very helpful (wish I remembered her name). I really liked that the tables were high, so you don't have to bend over to eat.

The service was average, my wife's burger was good, intructions on toppings was ignored by the kitchen. My soup came out cold, two visits, two bowls of cold soup, by the time it was heated my wife was done with her dinner, this is something they need to work on. I will give them one more try before deleting them from my options for dinner, it is really a shame that all sport bar type restaurants are cut from the exact same mold, nothing new here or exciting, just noisey and pretty good food for a premium price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-goodyear?start=100,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006

It's a great place to bring the kids as they provide some coloring material and the walls and interior are very colorful providing a good distraction for kids to look around.  The noise level is also conducive to kids as you won't get a lot of strange looks if your child happens to get a little loud.  They also have a good selection of chicken sandwiches as well if you aren't in the mood for a burger.  Their steak fries are good and come in a bottomless bucket, with as many refills as you want.   If you are in the mood for a decent priced burger and looking for quick service I would recommend checking Red Robin out.  I've never had a bad experience with the restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-goodyear?start=80,2.448,2.448,2.448,2.448,2.4480000000000004

71,Mandy J.,"Newark, DE",34,21,,3.0,2013-08-27,"I tend to avoid chains and I don't eat burgers and fries very often, so this place isn't really catering to me, anyhow... but for what it was, I didn't love it and I didn't hate it. Here's what I didn't love: I thought that the fries were supposed to be bottomless, but the server did not replenish them.  The restaurant is really loud. For what I had -- burger, fries, and a soda -- I ended up leaving $20 for my portion of the meal. That's too expensive for what I had. I don't want to pay that much for a meal like that unless I'm at a theme park or somewhere else with more of a geographic monopoly... or unless it's like the best burger and fries of all time, which it wasn't. Here's what I did like:  Even though the restaurant was crowded, we were seated quickly (party of 4).  The two teenagers who were in our party wanted to share a milkshake and the server brought it already split into two for them, which was nice.  My burger (guacamole bacon) was cooked the way I asked (medium rare -- sometimes places like this overcook even when I ask for medium rare) and tasted pretty good. It wasn't my favorite burger, but it was fine.  I upgraded to sweet potato fries, and I liked them! Anyhow, it's Red Robin. It's a chain. You know what it's going to be before you go, probably. We went because the teenagers in our party wanted to go. It wasn't my choice, but I thought I would share. There is a Red Robin really n ear my house in Delaware, and I never go and likely won't go.

It was the last of the Cardinal's football season which is a buy a double tavern and get another burger free promotion. We've been to other Red Robin's but interestingly have never been to this location that is so close to our house. When we stop by Red Robin it's usually for a burger and crispy fish sandwich. The bottomless fries come with both so we'll usually get onion rings with one of the meals and share. We know what to expect with the burgers which is well cooked and pretty tasty. We enjoy our favorite burger spots too much to stop her often but it's about as good as you'll get without stepping up to a gourmet burger. For example, they don't ask how you want it cooked. I like the crispy fish sandwich though and get it each visit. The seasoning for the fries is nice but we always seem to fill up on the fries waiting for the meal so not sure why we ordered a hummus plate appetizer. The hummus was the plain type but had some flavor. Would be nice for the plate to come with a couple different types of hummus. I can't say it was freshly made but it was good with the carrots, cucumbers and kettle chips. Their service was good. We had to wait a couple minutes to be seated. There wasn't anybody up front so we kind of stood there for a while. Our server was awesome. She was very friendly, had some good recommendations for appetizers and was attentive.

Then, after a 10 minute wait for the right burger, he stated he would remove the burger from the bill for the wait.  Here's where it gets shady. He comes with the bill and says manager wouldn't approve the removal. Alright, no biggie. But then he takes the bill back and offered to pay $5 on it, but brings back a different bill instead for $45. I pay with credit, he turns around and charges my card for $60 and hands me back the receipt which says it was ran for the $60, but no itemized bill. Didn't say a thing, brought it to me quickly with his head down, dropped it and ran. Couldn't find him after that to clear it up.  I didn't much care for the wait and I'm not upset that my order was put in wrong. I'm not even put off by being told they'd clear the burger off my receipt, then them not doing it.

We visited on a Tuesday at 11:30am. The place was already busy and getting busier by the minute. The hostess sat us and no one came by our table for over ten minutes. We had time to review the whole menu, and it's a long menu, and then spent a few minutes trying to catch a server's eye. I really needed water. Our server finally introduced himself and we placed our full order. Our service was fine after that. We tried the pretzel bites as an appetizer. They weren't bad, but the texture inside wasn't that chewy. They were VERY hot on the outside, so that was in their favor. I told my husband, ""They must have a really good heat lamp back there."" The cheese dip wasn't that good. It was watered down Cheez Whiz, basically. I had the southwestern salad with grilled chicken. I asked for no jalapeno coins and for my dressing to be on the side, and it came out as requested. The salad was okay, though I make better at home. It was watery beneath the salad greens. My husband liked his hamburger, but his overall opinion was it was ""okay."" He much prefers Smashburger or Five Guys, which are also cheaper. Red Robin serves fewer fries on the side than they used to, which was quite fine, really, and makes sense since they offer bottomless fries. Our server did come by to ask if he wanted more fries. The food just didn't stand out to me. I realized I haven't missed Red Robin at all.

Our waitress got very upset when I informed her that our refilled glasses did not belong to us and she took them away again to refill them or get us new ones. Who knows? Then she was so upset that I questioned her, she wouldn't even return to our table with the check and made another server do it. NEVER WILL WE RETURN TO THIS LOCATION. Rocio, you only got a tip because my teenage daughter was upset that I wasn't going to tip you even with the poor service and bad attitude. I DO NOT WANT TO DRINK OUT OF SOMEONES GLASS OR USE SOMEONES CHEWED UP STRAW. Bring me a new drink or a pitcher to refill our iced teas. Also, that french dip is WAY TOO salty.

We used to enjoy this Red Robin often when the food used to come out hot and tasty but it has now become a place of bland cold burgers with the worst service. Servers and those running food have no clue what they're doing. Don't get excited when your food finally comes after a long wait, it's probably some other tables food.  Alexis was our server and she is the cherry on top of why we will not be returning to Red Robin in the near future. They will rush you to pay your check before you finish chewing on your second bite of your burger. No offering desserts. No cleaning trash off your tables.

When it came out, I was surprised to see how few chips were on the plate. Most places give you a big basket of chips. $7 worth? Not so much. We forgot to say no salsa garnish on the queso so we had to scoop off the tomato chunks. But the queso tasted good and we even had some left over to dip our fries in. I ordered the Banzai Burger (no pink), and no lettuce, tomato, or mayo. That is one of three burgers I like to get. My other favorites are the Whiskey River BBQ Burger and the Royal Red Robin. My burger was cooked right and tasted good. I enjoyed dipping the fries in the leftover queso dip. I have to say I kind of miss the days when your food came in a basket and the burger was partly wrapped in paper. They are trying to be fancy now with the rectangular plates and bottomless metal cylinder for the fries. We asked our server for some more napkins and she brought us two. They sure are stingy with napkins here! She did a pretty good job keeping our waters refilled. And while she didn't ask if we wanted more fries, my friend requested some and she brought us a basket.

We have a toddler and a two week old newborn. If you are a parent; when you go out you want things to go as smooth as possible. So we decided to bring the stroller, so I could rock the stroller and put baby to sleep if need so to be.  The place was not busy, it was pretty empty. So we walk in and the first thing they say is ""oh you can't have a stroller inside, you can leave it up here but you cannot take it to the sitting area. I simply ask ""why?"". Their answer was that the space was reduced, but they could put one of those slings for the car seat.  This made me upset, because the things that hold the car seats there are the same size as our stroller. Also if they don't have a lot of people why is it a big deal.

I ordered and ice tea without lemon and when arrived it has lemon and she left so fast I couldn't even ask for sweet and low I had to go find some on another table. When our food arrived my son who requested no tomatoes had tomatoes on his burger. Again she took off so quick you couldn't request anything like mustard. The manager came over and I vented to him but he really didn't seem to be bothered by it. In fact, I heard him tell our waitress what a great first day she is having. That explained it all. So then our waitress comes back so we can pay and tells me to use the kiosk if I'm using my card and shortly realizes we don't have one on our table. She then takes my card to pay the bill and we asked for a to go box. Well here she comes with my receipt and again no to go box. We sat there for a little bit waiting but never saw her again.

Always want to say that I give good and bad when it's deserved she deserves a raise.
