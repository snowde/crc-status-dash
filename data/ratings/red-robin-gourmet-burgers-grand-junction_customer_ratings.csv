The waiter only asked half of us how we'd like our burgers cooked (the rest came well-done). They also got my order wrong, though it wasn't a tragedy since I could just scrape off the extra toppings that I didn't want. The food is about the same as any other Red Robin, which is nothing special. I do like their bottomless root beer floats and (not bottomless) shakes, though. As a chain, I think their menu is a little too large and the quality of some of the dishes a little too low. In particular, their ""gourmet"" burgers are definitely not ""gourmet"" in my opinion--they're about the quality that I'd expect from a medium-priced fast-food place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-grand-junction?start=20,2.604,2.604,2.604,2.604,2.604

The restaurant was very clean and appealing to the patrons, including us.  I had the Keep It Simple Burger and that was cooked just perfect for me. I enjoyed it and the endless fries that came with the order. I love it when my burger is just right. Makes for a really pleasurable dining experience. The drawbacks I thought were the music was a bit loud and the kiosks on each table were impossible to work. Turned out my dad's credit card got charged 3 times due to errors with the kiosk. Upon discovering what happened, my dad placed a call to the restaurant and explained to the manager what had happened with the kiosk and within 3 days the 2 additional charges were taken off my dad's account.

13,Jesco F.,"Grand Junction, CO",6,63,87.0,2.0,2016-01-20,"TL;DR: Extremely slow service and just so-so food. Obligatory dining for the Broncos /Realtree human billboard crowd. I've gone to this particular Red Robin several times for lunch meetings and family get togethers. The serve times are just absolutely painful. Seriously, if you go in here mark the time when you are seated and see how long it takes to get your food in front of you. It ranges from between 20-45 minutes. I have seen people walk out every time I've eaten here. The music and blaring sports channels are often too loud and the staff seems really disjointed and mis-managed. One server will have 10 tables and other servers and hostess will just stand and watch them flail leaving tables un-bussed, drinks unfilled and customers unhappily looking around waiting for someone to take their order or deliver their burgers. The worst times to eat here are between 1-5 in the afternoon during the week. I don't know if this is in-between shifts but they always seem short-staffed and management is nowhere to be seen. I don't know who hires or trains managers at the GJ Red Robin, but they seriously need to have their performance audited.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-grand-junction,,,,,

23,Crimson H.,"Grand Junction, CO",0,130,42.0,4.0,2016-07-30,Great service every time I go here. Most people will love this place. My only gripe is with the company not necessarily this location. I am severely intolerant of MSG. They claim they don't use MSG but they do use hydrolyzed Soy Protein. Free glutamates combine with free sodiums in the process of making this protein resulting in MSG. So when I eat here I ask for no seasoning on the fries and burger and I don't get any dipping sauces and avoid the salad dressing. That seams to minimize the impact. All in all though great burgers!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-grand-junction?start=20,3.08,3.08,3.08,,3.0800000000000005

I was directed to the bar to pick up my food. The only place to stand was near a smelly, drenched bar towel, dripping near my feet. The bartender was definitely too relaxed considering how busy it was. He lacked customer service and displayed an arrogant smirk when talking to me. He expected me to yell out my phone number across the bar to enter reward program info. When he brought over my bag, he sat it on a grate with a bunch of mush and liquid. I'm assuming this was the garnish area for drinks. I understand that restaurants can get super busy during peak hours but the guy made me feel like I wasn't important enough to be treated with with decent service. I would've just wrote it off as a bad visit but the food was even worse. My family loves Red Robin because they're pretty consistent with assembly and taste. Not this time. I could barely finish my chicken sandwich, it just did not taste right. Kinda of gave me that gag sensation. My fries weren't enjoyable either because they failed to provide the condiments I had asked for. The only thing that I almost finished was the small square of cake that cost me nearly $7.00.

I don't know if many places that have that! As my 8 year old's appetite increases, sometimes one small bowl of macaroni and cheese isn't enough. Shakes and specially drinks are plentiful for kids or adults. Burgers and bar type food is pretty good here, but they also offer healthier options. Appetizers, especially unlimited basket of fries are good to start with!  I like their Whiskey River BBQ chicken sandwich. The thin haystack onions are a delightful touch to this sandwich. My husband likes the Bonzai (teriyaki/pineapple) burger. Their onion rings are meh...I always order them and am almost always disappointed because they're nothing extraordinary. It's inconsistent, I think, whether we get our burgers/sandwiches on a plate or in a basket. I always ask for a plate, just to be sure, because I find the food gets too messy with a basket. This restaurant is LOUD! If you're looking for something intimate or need to have an important conversation, you might choose someplace else. That's why i think it's good for family or big groups.

As a customer who USED to be able to eat anything off the menu, going here was a pain. If you don't get a good waiter/waitress you're not going to enjoy your time here. I've had burgers undercooked/over cooked, even after stressing that it be done a certain way. The service has never been great here, as I've had to wait a really long time for food and/or repeat several times that I needed something.  As a customer who now has to avoid gluten, I assumed Red Robin's gluten free bun would be a good option. Once again, separate of the bad service, I was disappointed. If there is a gluten free bun, there should be knowledge of cross contamination. A restaurant can't just throw in a gf bun and say ""hey this is gluten friendly!"" Because that's not what I've experienced here.  I asked for a regular burger with a gluten free bun - regular, as in meat, bun, lettuce, tomato, with ketchup on the side - and they brought me a loaded cheeseburger with sauces I didn't ask for, waaaay too much ketchup, and extras that were not necessary. To say the least, my stomach was NOT happy with me after eating here.  I know that as a gf person, it is in part, my responsibility to do prior research before going to a restaurant. However, after doing research, RR makes it seem like you have options when you really don't have many.  I would not recommend in general, but stay away from here if you have a gluten allergy.

Sherman was our server. Could he be any nicer?! He was so good to the adults and kids. Great service and food was as expected. I'm giving it five stars for what its trying to be... a successful chain restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-grand-junction,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96
