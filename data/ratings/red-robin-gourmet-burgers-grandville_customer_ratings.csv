29,Anne A.,"East Lansing, MI",4,39,,1.0,2012-03-26,"This was my worst experience ever at a Red Robin.  The $8 margarita was obviously missing the main ingredient:  tequilla.  The drink was the worst margarita I ever had.  The turkey burger was tasty, but gave me indigestion.  The endless supply of fries stopped coming at the second serving.  My husband's salad was mediocre at best.  Will not be visiting this Red Robin again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-grandville?start=20,2.436,2.436,2.436,2.436,2.436
32,Aaron O.,"Wyoming, MI",16,82,13.0,3.0,2013-01-08,"I visited this location on a Sunday evening around five o'clock.The restaurant was clean and the semi open kitchen looked organized. The wait staff was friendly enough and our food was delivered quickly, so much in fact that I felt like I was being rushed. We were not asked if we would like anything for desert the check was simply presented the third time by the table while with a(finishing up here?) The shroom burger was tasty and well cooked although a little awkward to eat being presented half wrapped in a little basket.  No room to set the burger down and what do you do with the wrapper when you are done? Wad it up and try to eat your fries? Which were quite tasty and well cooked. I would recommend the freckled lemonade if you do eat here,the chunky strawberries go great with the tangy lemonade. Prices are high for the food, gourmet in your name or not $10.00 for a hamburg splashed with a couple fries is a little much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-grandville?start=20,2.636,2.636,2.636,2.636,2.636
21,Grant P.,"Downers Grove, IL",277,539,244.0,4.0,2013-07-09,"""And the red, red robin goes bob, bob, bobbin' along."" I have this fantasy of using song lyrics in all my reviews, but I know it's never gonna happen. Ahem, I digress.  Did I really just drive 80 miles to eat at Red Robin? My odometer says yes. And okay, it was my mother-in-law who chose tonight's dining destination, and her palate consists of all things chain restaurant and not much else. Not that there's anything wrong with that. I like Red Robin.  I like Red Robin, however, for the wrong reasons. I love the jalapeño coin appetizer. I love their stupid bottomless stunt drinks like Freckled Lemonade and Melonade which tastes a whole lot less skin cancery than it sounds. And I totally love the unlimited, never ending  steak fries and ""Campfire"" dipping sauce, which tastes like a holy combination of barbecue and ranch. As I've said before, potatoes make me happy and infinite amounts of them provide for endless happiness. Somewhere out there there's a shrink about to say that Food should not provide happiness. Or that I'm compensating for something or...blah, blah, blah...Fudge off.  I dream about those fries.  In other news, I totally think their burgers are overpriced and overrated. They're way too small for the price you pay, and they mask the lame quality of beef with all the crap they pile on top. I can never figure out which one I want, and usually end up with a meh one.  Service was super friendly and attentive, plus she anticipated our needs so that's a definite plus. Rock on, Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-grandville?start=20,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003,2.8000000000000003
24,Kayla D.,"Grand Rapids, MI",20,130,5.0,4.0,2013-10-01,"The food is a little pricy, but it's consistently good.  My favorite is the gourmet cheeseburger, with bleu cheese and extra pickle. With a bottomless freckled lemonade to drink, I fill up on fruit before my burger even arrives. Their chicken is good too, the onion rings and cheese sticks are great. Once we had an order of cheese sticks that were still frozen, we sent them back and they gave them back hot, and free.  It is loud, it's almost as if they're playing pure noise along with the music. The servers are usually polite, we've only ever had one bad server and that was at the Woodland location.  It's a once and awhile place to go, but I've never had a terrible experience here. It's worth stopping in once for the bottomless fries and a cherry limeaid.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-grandville?start=20,2.768,2.768,2.768,2.768,2.768
28,Nick P.,"Hopkins, MI",13,28,,2.0,2014-05-11,"Red robin used to be our go to place whenever we knew there was one on the area. In the past year they have dramatically changed the menu and raised their prices. Burgers, which used to be the proud star of this show, have since been buried in the back of the menu. Now foods that are highlighted don't seem to make sense at all for what red robin built their reputation on. Now it's grilled chicken topped with a sauce or even pasta. For their part the wait stuff did a magnificent job and all drinks did not even drop below 1/2 full before they filled them. I bought the prime rib French dip. The prime rib was much tougher than most roast beefs and the au jus was warm water. Steak fries are still bottomless, although 5 served at a time. The sandwich also came with cole slaw, which was cabbage and mayonnaise. And all this for the low low price of 11.99 for the sandwich. What a disappointment. Seems red robin is going through a bit of a personality disorder and I hope they get their act together soon because I won't be back until they do.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-grandville?start=20,,,,,
19,Ashley S.,"Grand Rapids, MI",0,7,,2.0,2014-12-19,My husband and I used to come here quite a bit...we won't be back. Our server was training someone and when the server(in training) wasn't at the table our server talked down about her...made us Very uncomfortable. The server in training was doing a great job!  We both got burgers....so not worth asking how we would like it cooked when it comes out well done. The burgers didn't have the burst of flavor I was looking for...just barbeque on a bun.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-grandville,,,,,
30,Rachel G.,"Grandville, MI",1,8,,3.0,2014-12-29,"their ""bottomless fries"" is a joke. you get about 10 fries in a basket and they give you one for every two people. they barley come around to give you more. should defiantly be ran differently, but all and all it's good. the food is good and they have good drinks and sauces. my favorite is camp fire sauce!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-grandville?start=20,,,,,

23,Hailey S.,"Cadillac, MI",27,5,,3.0,2015-06-21,"This restaurant was a very a-typical franchise experience. I got the Garden Burger that was average, with the sweet potato fries which were super salty. My mom got a borderline inedible pasta dish. BUT, with that being said, our waitress was superb and handled the situation with poise and grace. She offered her a different dish of her choice and had me fresh fries made. Overall, I would say this is a very average visit to a franchised restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-grandville?start=20,,,,,

The food was good, but the service was non-existent.  We saw our server 3 times, and the last two were when we flagged her down.  ""Unlimited"" fries only works when someone stops by your table and asks if you'd like more fries.  By the time flagged her down to get our bill, we were running late and getting very frustrated.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-grandville,,,,,

We sit waiting for fries while 5 different managers just walked by us and in the booth next to us 2 managers where doing an employee review which was interesting to listen to.

7,Chris H.,"Grand Rapids, MI",11,197,204.0,4.0,2016-04-15,"The atmosphere here is the same as all Red Robins. Which includes a lot of red. It is actually very nice inside.  I ordered the Very Berry Raspberry Limeade ($4). A 1/2 order of Boneless Wings: whiskey bbq sauce ($5). The Southern Charm Burger ($14). And lastly a Chocolate Shake ($4). The Limeade was very tasty and was bottomless so there were many refills. The wings also were very good and came with onion strings and chips, however they were very small, and I do mean very small. I've never seen boneless wings anywhere near that small. The southern charm burger was very good, probably the best part of meal but wow is it pricey. The burger consists of 1 patty glazed with brown sugar, topped with candied bacon, honey bbq sauce, sharp cheddar cheese, with caramelized onions, on a toasted ciabatta bun. The candied bacon was extremely good and the bun was perfect. The only negative was it felt too small, I really liked it but wish it was a little bigger. The burger comes with bottomless steak fries which are ok but nothing special. Lastly the shake was good with no complaints.  The waitress was very friendly and helpful.  Overall I give it 4 stars. The food was good, but small and pricey. The service was good, but long wait times for the food during a slow period. Will I be back? Yes, but not regularly!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-grandville,3.24,3.24,3.24,,3.2400000000000007
13,Wendi S.,"Mattawan, MI",72,12,,1.0,2016-06-18,Our waitress was nice but clueless.  We were seated immediately and it took an hour and a half to get our food.  My husband asked for them to change the tv station to watch the Tigers game the manager said he would change the station and never did!

Service is typically excellent.  Food is almost always done right.  There really is nothing to complain about in our opinion.  My wife and I are both Royalty Club members so we do get discounts and free burgers on occasion.

8,Taylor N.,"Allendale Charter Township, MI",242,5,5.0,2.0,2017-02-01,"Very meh. Server was nice and made a good drink recommendation, but my burger was not what I was expecting when I read ""gourmet burgers"".  It was very small and although it tasted alright did not live up to the expectation. Our extra side salads that we ordered did not come out before our meal while we watched them sit in the window for a solid 10-15 minutes before coming out with our burgers. What really bothered me though was the lack of pre-bussing done on the table. My first bar drink that I finished was on the table until the end of the meal. Normally this wouldn't be a problem, but our table was a small two top with not much room to begin with. And we were RIGHT next to the server station/ kitchen which was very noisy, but I get sections and everything so I wasn't going to complain about that. Overall it wasn't a very memorable meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-grandville,3.2,3.2,3.2,,3.2000000000000006

Our server Tyler was friendly, and attentive without being a pest.  I ordered the Sir Acha double tavern burger. I wasn't asked how I'd like the burger cooked but it arrived with only minimal pink and was cooked to my liking.  I was all about the fries today and was really concerned I was gonna have a long wait on refills.  They were very quick in getting another basket out to me.   My friend ordered the Avo Cobb O salad, which she enjoyed except for the bacon pieces in it which she said were too tough.  She also ordered a Raspberry tea which she said wasn't sweet enough and had a strange taste.   That didn't keep her from having a refill however :) All in all we had a great lunch, excellent service and we will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-grandville,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005

9,P M.,"Byron Center, MI",0,9,,2.0,2017-11-17,This was our first time at a Red Robin. They were busy when we got there. Not too long of a wait for a Friday night (20-25 min).  I ordered the fish and shrimp dinner. My husband ordered a chicken wrap. My son ordered a bacon cheeseburger and my daughter ordered the mini corn dogs and fruit. Two orders of fries came right away but then after that the service got slow. Our waitress would walk pass our table a few times before she picked up any empty dishes on the table. It took them a long time to get my daughter's endless fruit. She would have ate more had they not been so slow. They were just really small condiment bowls so I'm not sure why it took forever. After we ate she never picked up our empty plates. We ordered dessert and they dropped it off but didn't clear any of our dinner plates so we didn't have much room. We asked for a to go box and that took forever to get as well. The table behind us had to put their coats on to give the waitress a hint that they wanted their bill. They did not seem short staffed- there were lots of them around. They just didn't seem too fast.  Just walking around doing nothing. Not using their time wisely. Management really needs to work in this.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-grandville,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92

My fries had a hair in them and I politely sent them back and the meal was promptly remade. I never received so much as an apology for our inconvenience and I felt like I was swept under the rug.
