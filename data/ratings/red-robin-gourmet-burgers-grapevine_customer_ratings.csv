Brought us a basket of maybe six fries. Our server Arnold was not attentive & gave us our check before we had asked. I still was ordering drinks.

I usually order my giant salad and eat off of the hubbies fries. The last few times there have been more goof ups but they are usually resolved pretty quickly. (We are pretty easy going.) We would stop by here more often but William D Tate was a pain before construction, last time we came here it was almost impossible to leave the restaurant!

92,Rae C.,"Fort Worth, TX",92,308,31.0,3.0,2013-01-04,"Look. I like Red Robin's burgers, I do. As a vegetarian, you can throw a Garden Burger on to almost any of their burgers and have a fantastic meal. I particularly love the chicken bruschetta burger, minus the chicken. The thing is their prices. Their prices, and the set up of their bar area. I have said it before - I love children, I work with children every day, but I do not want to hang out with kids in my free time. So why, why dear sweet lord in heaven above, would they put the children's arcade area adjacent to the bar?? And an even bigger why is why do people seat their families in the bar area??? IT'S A BAR. You cannot escape children in this restaurant. Nothing ruins a beer and a burger for me like children screaming for quarters to play arcade games or for the attention of their parents who are clearly trying to pretend like their children are strange savages, unknown to them, while they try to get a buzz on. Their prices do them no favors - we recently went to redeem my free birthday burger (hooray!) but even with us only paying for one burger and two beers, the tab was about $10 more than it would have been for us to both get a burger, get two gigantic beers each, and maybe even a side of fries and tater tots at our favorite mom & pop burger joint right down the road. So even with free shit (and like any normal person, I LOVE free shit) they still aren't winning my favor. Maybe it's worth it if you just really want one of their gigantic milkshakes?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-grapevine?start=80,3.2760000000000007,3.2760000000000007,3.2760000000000007,3.2760000000000007,3.276000000000001
96,Deborah W.,"Euless, TX",0,18,1.0,5.0,2013-01-10,"This is  me & my husband 's mid week go to place. I know it's a burger resturant but a lot of people don't know about their ""wings"". The  wings are unbelievably good. They put the neighboring wing joints: Buffalo, Plukers & Hooters to shame. Along with the bottomless fries?,Man!!!. Say what you will about the burgers but the wings are really big & meaty. A basket of about eight to ten for five bucks all day long you can not beat.  The girls working the bar at nite, Victoria, Britney and the other one with the awesome colored hair, are phenomenal. They mix a pretty good drink to help get over the hump. I think it's a nice touch that the  manager, Jerry is always visibly notice, stopping by each  table with a  pleasant smile making sure the guest are doing okay.  I do think that they should get rid of the video games area or move it away from the bar. I just dont see the point in this day & age of kids paying to play some chuckie cheese video arcade when they no doudt have a more safisicated game system waiting for them at home. I wish my son would ask me for a dollar in quarters to play a game when I just paid $300 plus for a brand new game system, please. Anyway, that a different subject.   I really can't find any major fault  about this place. All I can say about the location is that they were on W.D. Tate before all the mess of  construction started.  It's a great spot. As long as they keep the wings big, flavorable & the price reasonable, you'll find me and the hubby there mid week when the desire to cook at home is zero.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-grapevine?start=80,3.508,3.508,3.508,3.508,3.508
114,Rick M.,"The Colony, TX",22,11,,1.0,2013-02-09,"I will try to be brief. I have managed 5 star restaurants and a casino for the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Chain so my standards are very HIGH for customer service, food and cleanliness. There should be NO mistake or half stepping with these three TOP PRIORITIES in any class of food chain. Profits flow when this is in order and supervised. This burger joint looks like its owners and management took a long vacation and lost their way back home. I personally walked the restaurant while eating there and asked 2 tables how was their service. 1 (one) table said the waitress will be mad when she sees her ""To Insure Proper Service"" as nothing $0.00, because this establishment hurries to take your order; hurries you to eat. My waitress picked up the check and cash then said ""would you like change back"".  Which is TOTALLY unacceptable she literally asked for her ""TIPS"". Wait staff just take the check and charge and return the rest the customer decides NOT the wait staff. Bathroom was filthy, carpet was stained and dirty and when we sat down the booths had food in the chair still. Whom ever doesn't't look or complaint about these situation deserve to eat here. I will continue to eat in 4 to 5 star establishments you get what you pay for.  P.S I forgot the managers clothing looked like he took his cloths out of his hamper before he arrived to work.

This was first time visiting this location and they have wide varieties of selections and we asked to give us a moment; that moment was about 15mins - he said he had a birthday party table.

Hummus was poor with stale chips, kind of like mines at home. The giant onion rings were wonderfully crunchy. Bottomless fries were OK... not good enough to get a second round.  My pineapple burger was good, but way too saucy? Flavory? Messy? Took too much away from the burger itself. Only able to finish half before I threw in the towel.

My wife and 2 kids (4 years old and 1 year old) went here because I wanted to try the new Grapevine Craft Brewery beer. They had it plus a ton of other great craft beers including Revolver's Blood and Honey. We ordered our food and it was there before the kids even had time to become super annoying. I had the ragin cajun which is awesome. They've redone their plates and serving and it feels a lot more gourmet. They still have wonderful bottomless fries too.  So we had the Lakefire beer (the grapevine craft brewery beer) and it was awesome. The manager came over to check on us and to say thanks. When I told him why we were there he offered another beer of my choosing for free. Totally cool.

126,Connie M.,"Grapevine, TX",0,17,,2.0,2014-03-10,"Meh. First time here and probably the last. Visit started out strong and we were optimistic when we got the yummy onion rings for an app. We weren't drinking beer on this visit, but I certainly would have ordered a Lakefire beer (being a local beer and all), if our intrusive and always-bugging-us waiter had mentioned it. Instead, he was just trying to get our order in before we even sat down. Anyway, very good onion rings and the fries that came with the sandwich and burger were pretty tasty too. The BLTA sandwich was sad. Since bacon was the first ingredient in the name, I kinda thought it would come with more than a one square inch piece on each half. About the same amount of avocado too. Basically, it was an expensive turkey sandwich with nothing but pressed turkey and a ton of lettuce. He got the burger with an egg thing. Unfortunately, as soon as he picked it up, the whole bun disintegrated before he could even get a bite. Messy food is usually good, but this was just a pile of stuff that wasn't really worth the trouble. Throw that all together with the waiter that was always there but didn't accomplish much, and we were ready to get out of there.  May stop back in for some fries and local beer someday, but there's really going to have to be no other options available.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-grapevine?start=120,3.32,3.32,3.32,3.1760000000000006,3.3200000000000003

We were greeted at the door and seated right away at a booth.  Our waitress came by right away and took our drink order.  When she came back with our drinks we went ahead and got our food order as we were all ready to eat. I like to get the fried clam strips here.  There are not a lot places that you can get fried clam strips so this is always something special I get here.  The clams are always tender, and are a good size.  The portion is generous, and combined the fires it makes a full meal. The family really enjoys the chicken fingers and fries, and we got a tower of onion rings.  The rings were very good, the crust was flaky and crunchy, and they were served piping hot. The manager stopped by to check on the service, and overall we had a great experience.  Overall we enjoyed our visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-grapevine?start=40,3.88,3.88,3.88,3.12,3.88

64,Jess M.,"Tijuana, Mexico",366,364,1041.0,3.0,2015-04-20,"I went for lunch today because they participate in the Hilton Honors Dining Dollars rewards program. I have been to other Red Robin Burger joints before and they are always tasty and clean. This one is no exception. I had the California Grilled Chicken sandwich and it was awesome. I didn't have to wait long and it was fresh and hot when it arrived. The fries were good too. I love that seasoned salt they have here. The burgers are also noteworthy and should be eaten (in moderation of course). I have not had a burger from this location, but at the Red Robins in NC and FL, they are really damn good. I was on my lunch break, so I had a Diet Coke to drink, but I always make mental observations about what is available on tap in case I decide to come back for happy hour or before I recommend having drinks to my coworkers or friends. This one had a few decent ones, but not my favorite. That loses it one star. The staff was friendly. The prices were average to moderately high compared to the competition of the same caliber. The chicken sandwich, Diet Coke and 20% tip (which I leave for everyone wherever I go unless the service is exceptionally bad) came out to be about 18 bucks. The average tab for the same lunch at Twin Peaks, Buffalo Wild Wing and Hooters is usually around $14, so this one is just a bit higher (BWW is closer at $16). Overall it is a perfect place for lunch. I enjoyed the food. I was in and out. They have free wireless internet that works and isn't painfully slow (like it is at Hooters).

They do have gluten free buns (or no bun option)  as well as veggie burgers so that is a nice alternative. It's a good place to bring family and I hear you get a free burger on your birthday.

18,Susan B.,"Dallas, TX",15,79,9.0,2.0,2015-07-07,"I've only eaten at Red Robin once before, probably about 5 years ago and it happened to be at this particular location. I've since had to go gluten-free and was happy to hear that they serve a gluten-free bun. I hadn't had a hamburger in a while and figured this would be the time to have one. We went on a Tuesday during the 12 - 1 lunch time and the place wasn't overly crowded. We were seated immediately and it didn't take long for the server to come over and take our drink orders. He was pleasant, but not what I'd call friendly and seemed to be in a hurry to move on. I got a feeling that he was rushing us along. Although the music was so loud it was difficult to hear what he was saying. He asked if we wanted fries while we waited for our orders. He brought the fries, took the orders and left before we could ask for napkins and silverware. I'm not really sure why they advertise their burgers as ""gourmet"" other than they can then charge over $10 for a hamburger and fries. There was nothing special or gourmet about my guacamole and bacon burger. It wasn't thick by any means. The bacon was more like little pieces of bacon with a thin smear of guacamole. It was more lettuce than anything else. The gluten-free bun was like hard rubber. I tried to cut the sandwich in half but it was so tough and my steak knife met with so much resistance that the knife literally flipped out of my hand and landed on the floor. The server never once came back to ask how our food was or to ask if we wanted more of their ""endless fries"". On the whole I'd say the meal was not worth the money. Paying just under eleven bucks for a burger and a handful of fries is a little pricey in my opinion.

Asked and received a small booth in back of restaurant. Is warm and stuffy back here, even waitress remarked on it. Have been looking at the filthy un-bussed table diagonal from me throughout my meal. Apparently cleaning up isn't a high priority, even though it's not busy yet. Ordered their Jungle Shake to start - skip this. Supposed to be Baileys Irish Cream blended with banana liqueur, chocolate syrup and vanilla ice cream. Is nothing but a chocolate shake. No hint of  spirits at all. No banana or Baileys detected. Bonus: it was a mess! Like every shake I've ever had here, it was served dripping over the sides and already melting. Yes, it's 100 degrees outside and it's warm in my section, but this is Red Robin Grapevine modus operandi. They can't bother themselves to wipe it down before serving. Huge mess. Got the plain old Gourmet cheeseburger, medium, with pepper jack and no onions. Automatically comes with lettuce, tomato, pickle, mayo and bottomless steak fries. Ordered a wheat bun. Nothing special here. Greasy, dripping onto plate (which is plastic). Fries are good, so that was a relief. Also ordered the huge mud slide dessert. Ice cream and Oreo cookie crumbles drizzled with chocolate and caramel sauces. Ate the entire thing and not going to apologize. Wasn't top notch ice cream for sure (prefer gelato) but it was a great sugar bomb and eased my crankiness with the rest of the meal. Nice waitress, decent service.

I said ""no, we would like refills on our drinks and more fries"" ... She then starts to fill up in her section .. 3 more couple came in. Instead of getting our drinks and putting in our fry order, she goes to two other tables...talks to them for a bit (they had already ordered and gotten appetizers) .. She then brings over the couple across from us more drinks...still not filling ours!! I looked at her, she looks at our empty glasses at the end of the table, then goes and brings us more drinks.

Also got a blue moon shake (not bottomless lol) to try. MMM! For a chain place, we enjoyed ourselves very much here. The burger was a good size, moist and flavorful. Although it wasn't cooked medium rare like the fancier burger places, it was good anyways. It had a reasonable amount of toppings, cant recall what type of burger exactly we got. The chicken burger was good as well, I got the one with grilled chicken and the chicken was grilled perfectly. The fries were good as well! They were kinda addicting, thank goodness they were bottomless! They were seasoned lightly but we had the option of adding our own seasoning ourselves.

70,Amy J.,"Dallas, TX",0,2,,1.0,2016-04-16,"I have been to Red Robin multiple times in various locations from Virginia to Idaho and had never had a bad experience, so since I'd never been in Texas and it had been a while we decided to this location for a late lunch at around 2 pm on a Friday. We ordered BBQ boneless wings, chili, 2 different burgers with different fries, with multiple sauces. Every last bit was disappointing, as was the service. I am not overwhelmingly nit-picky, but I'm going to give you my full laundry list of issues with my meal, including those which I might not have bothered mentioning had the overall experience been acceptable. The good: -The place seemed clean, the hostess was pleasant, and we were seated promptly. -One of the burgers was okay. The bad and ugly: The boneless wings were almost un-sauced. Half of each wing was completely dry, and the other half was only lightly sauced. I would have asked for sauce but by the time our waitress was back to see how things were or take any further order from us, they would have been cold, and cold boneless wings are worse than un-sauced boneless wings. The ranch was okay, but I'm pretty sure it's a Hidden Valley seasoning packet. I'm not picky, I don't expect scratch ranch at a restaurant in this price range, and I love Hidden Valley. This order of wings itself would not have been a problem had the rest of the meal been acceptable. A bowl of chili was ordered so that we might try it and allow it to influence our burger order (whether or not to order the chili burger). The chilli was completely flavorless and the texture was pretty awful. Not even a quarter of this very small bowl of chilli was eaten. My burger was ordered medium rare with no lettuce or tomato, with extra sauce on the side (after the wings, I'm sure you can see why) with sweet potato fries. The burger was unevenly cooked. It seemed as though it was cooked to done on one side, then flipped and very rare on the other as though they were attempting to make up for the mishap. I could ALMOST understand if they were busy, but again, this is after 2, almost 3 PM on a weekday at this point. In addition to being slightly burnt, which by itself I wouldn't complain about, the sweet potato fries were old and dried to the point at which they did not even look appetizing. Now, I love sweet potato fries and am pretty forgiving of these, but I ate maybe 2. They were terrible. The other burger we had ordered, I had a bite of, and it was actually cooked acceptably. The menu said nothing about lettuce or tomato, but the burger came with it. Whether this was a misprint or a mishap by the cook, there is no telling, but either way it was easily fixable so no real complaint there. The only real problem with this burger, and actually both burgers, is that it was not hot. It was slightly above room temperature, and it seemed as though the plates had been sitting a while before they were brought to our table. This, again, if busy, I could understand, but it is around 3 PM on a weekday. The waitress was just not good. She way too obviously fake. She obviously did not care about anything regarding the table and was only putting on a smile for the sake of her tip. At no point did she attempt any type of rapport or to be a real person, which is fine, as this is just her job I understand this. The issue is though, that as an employee she's paid to put forth effort into my experience as a customer, and as a customer, I am unable to walk into the kitchen to get my food when it's ready. This in itself is not enough to warrant a rant, but there were very few attempts to check with the table, and only after asking for a refill did a glass with only ice that had been sitting empty as she walked by on multiple occasions get refilled with Dr Pepper. As we left the building neither the hostess or employee who appeared to be a manager standing near the door said anything as we walked past. We had not been rude or even complained about our service or food regardless of our issues, and this final display of indifference was the cherry on top of an overall horrendous experience. TL;DR- Indifferent staff leads to unpleasant experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-grapevine?start=40,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.7880000000000003,3.1600000000000006

Our server came to introduce himself, speaking very fast. It was hard to catch a lot of what he said- the specials, etc. But whatever, we knew what we wanted. I ordered the bacon cheese burger with sweet and spicy ketchup to dip my fries. Our server disappeared for ages and the food was delivered by kitchen staff. We had no silverware and had to chase down our server to ask for some help. The food was excellent, burger cooked perfectly. I always wish the first batch of fries was larger- I swear there were only 7 or 8 total fries on the plate when my food was served. No biggie, they are bottomless so I asked for a 2nd round a bit into my meal. RR now has special dipping sauces for their fries- a few that are free and a few premium ones that cost like $0.50 or something. I really like the sweet & spicy ketchup and campfire sauce, both free. The campfire sauce sort of tastes like BBQ and ranch mixed together- creamy and pretty good. But the sweet & spicy ketchup is so good. Give it a try. Being a chain, I guess I assume that most people have at least heard of Red Robin, and probably have already tried it. So no reason to pitch the menu or the scene. The menu is loaded with burger options, with some other alternative dishes for non-burger lovers. There's chicken tenders, and some chicken sandwiches. Also options for vegetarians plus they have turkey burgers if that's your thing. There's a decent kids menu with appropriate portions for smaller stomachs. Freckles Lemonade is really good but, be warned, it's so full of sugar!

I ordered a carry out and upon arriving I saw several other cars sitting in the car side area so I decided to walk in and save the time. I walked in to the bar and stood for about 5 minutes waiting for someone to come. The bartender walked up and asked if I was one of the delivery services and I advised no I am just a regular carry out. I handed her a printed out copy of a e-gift card and she walked away. I waited patiently and after about 10 minutes the manager came back and advised the balance on the card. I added a tip and signed. I got home and found that the burger I ordered which was supposed to be a double patty was only a single patty and I selected the extra fries box but there was just a few scattered in the container. It was all pretty good it just wasn't the best experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-grapevine?start=20,3.28,3.38,3.38,,3.3400000000000003

19,Angela G.,"Carrollton, TX",19,5,3.0,1.0,2017-07-08,"My husband and I decided to go here for lunch with our toddler. Red Robin has always been one of our favorite burger places, but this location is nasty. We got there at about 1:30 on a Saturday afternoon and there were three cars in the parking lot. Bone Daddy's across the street had about a 75% full parking lot. This should have been our first clue. We walked in and the restaurant smelled off. It should smell like burgers and fries, but it had more of a sweaty, dirty smell. We were seated and ordered some drinks. After that, I leaned my arms on the table and it was very sticky. I told my husband, he asked for a baby wipe to wipe off the table. He laid it flat on the table and tried to wipe, but it wouldn't move. He had to peel it off the table. He started scrubbing and very quickly the wipe started turning black from all the dirt and residue on the table. I gagged a little, it was really gross. We called the manager over and he didn't seem to care at all. Just said ""Oh, well, we're looking into getting new table tops."" New table tops doesn't help the fact that they don't appear to have been cleaned in a very long time. If the table tops are that nasty, we didn't want to think about what the kitchen was like. We got up and left. So revolting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-grapevine?start=20,3.24,3.37,3.37,,3.318
33,Rick B.,"Pasadena, CA",0,8,,1.0,2017-08-12,"I don't know what's going on with this Red Robin's, I've had good experiences at their other locations. It started off with a pick up order, usually I would go out and get it myself but this time my leg was swollen and painful to walk so I try to stay off it if possible. I had a decent order about $80.00 and called the number for their curb side service to let them know I was here. A lady answered the phone and said they would be right out, I understand if they're busy,  I can wait. But after 20 minutes of no delivery I had to go in which defeated my purpose of not wanting to walk. I went to the pick up counter and again had to wait another 10 minutes while they arranged my food to pick up. And to top it off they weren't busy at all but might have been understaffed. Unpacked it at home and they forgot some things with the order, hardly any fries and very cold food. An unpleasant experience to say the least. So I give them another shot because any business can have a bad day and no one's perfect. Ordered online and went inside to pickup the food, wasn't ready again and waited. Mind you this was a small order of a few items and again place isn't busy....now I know why. Arrived home and noticed the skimpy portion they served me, not up to standards like the other Red Robin's. Needless to say I won't be going back again, employees seem unmotivated and that lies on the manager to train his or her staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-grapevine,3.12,3.35,3.35,,3.258

29,Bre S.,"Lewisville, TX",0,6,1.0,1.0,2017-09-25,Just got a to-go order from this location and we are beyond disappointed. 90% of the reason we was for the fries. Ordered a burger with bottomless and an extra side to go with it. Normally that's more than enough for both of us. It looked like they honestly didn't make enough and just took fries from my burger to put in the other box. There was a grand total of 15 between the two orders. Both my boyfriend and I have worked in the service industry quite a lot and this is just unacceptable. His wings had almost no sauce to top it off. Only reason I gave two stars was they put the burger together okay. Update: Moved the review down to one star because I couldn't chew through half of the burger. It was hard but for some reason liquid (from lettuce/tomatos???) kept dripping everywhere. I usually love Red Robin but this meal just made me feel sick to my stomach.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-grapevine,2.96,3.35,3.35,,3.194

The hostesses looked annoyed when you walk in, servers look disheveled and are rude, and it gets filthier each time I go. This last visit was final straw. After using dirty restroom where my feet stuck to floor (it wasn't from recent mopping I assure you) I sat down to a roach over 2 inches long crawling on wall by my head. Nope nope nope.

She never took our empty plate but didn't hold it against her not knowing the policy of never-ending french fries.  However, the BLTA was so dry and had way more turkey than bacon, it was more like a Club than a BLT - and on a FAKE STALE 'croissant'. The place was dirty or at least the wall next to us had ketchup splattered on it. The manager did come and ask if everything was ok but I couldn't put my finger on what was wrong with the BLTA until after so said 'all fine'.
