41,Brent O.,"Rochester, NY",2,8,1.0,4.0,2014-02-17,"So, this place just opened about 2 weeks ago and is already a hit with the town. Like many new restaurants that just open, the place has been packed nearly every night.  I finally made it in here over the weekend and was pleasantly surprised how well it was being run. When I arrived with my party of four the lobby was packed. The Hostess informed us that it would be about 20 mins for a table.  We were seated in about 15 mins. We we're then greeted by our server who was very pleasant.  We ordered some drinks and an appetizer and within a few minutes both were at our table. next we ordered our meals. The menu is mainly burgers but they also have chicken, pork and a few seafood items. They probably have about 30 specialty burgers to choose from. Our food arrived quickly as well. One of the orders was incomplete,  but upon bringing it to our servers attention it was very quickly fixed. After we were finished,  payment was handled quickly and we we're on our way. Even though the place was packed, at no time did we ever feel rushed by our server. The place was nicely lite and very clean. Average burger meal cost around $10 and drinks were about $4 each.  A little expensive but not bad for something different with excellent service.  also FYI... their fries are some of the best I have ever had and they are BOTTOMLESS/ ALL YOU CAN EAT.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greece?start=40,2.448,2.448,2.448,2.448,2.4480000000000004
30,The Count V.,"Rochester, NY",64,147,30.0,3.0,2014-03-17,"Came to this brand new location at the nicer end of the Greece Ridge mall. There is an outside entrance and an indoor entrance. The restaurant has a pretty large dining area. I estimate this place to seat at least 200 patrons at any given time.  If you come in through the outside entrance, you will come upon a small lobby area with a hostess station. From there, there is an extensive seating area and a bar to the right and the kitchen to the left. As you walk deeper you will see the hallway expand into a larger dining area that is designed to look like a restaurant that opens up into the mall with short window panels. I didn't really notice the decor (rare for me) because I was just way too hungry to care at that point. Oops. So let's talk food. This place is about the burger. Big, juicy ground hunks of cow. Smothered, covered, sprinkled, dressed, naked, whatever you want they can make it. I have had the chophouse burger, the hawaiian style one with pineapple, and the swiss/mushroom burger. All have been delicious. Jacqui got a club sandwich. It was decent, but I'm not big on cold cuts. I asked for the steamed broccoli to be unseasoned and it was cooked perfectly. I don't believe I've had any of the appetizers before so I cannot comment on that. They also have some other sandwiches, but I didn't pay much mind to those at that time. It's hard to judge service on just one visit, but it was a good experience. Our waitress was friendly and helpful, kept our glasses full, refilled my bottomless broccoli, and was fairly efficient. What prevented me from rating this 4 stars? The layout. It was kind of like squeezing through a crowded bar even though it wasn't really busy. You're walking down a little hallway between the dining room and the kitchen. You have people running in and out of the kitchen, waiters and waitresses bustling back and forth in the hallway, and patrons walking to and from their tables. It was a bit of a cluster[insert vulgarity here] ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greece?start=20,2.38,2.38,2.38,2.38,2.38
31,Nathan J.,"Rochester, NY",3,3,3.0,4.0,2014-04-19,"This place just opened recently in the area and decided to give it a shot. Went in not expecting anything special. Was immediately greeted by the wonderful hostess who seated us in these super comfortable chairs at a table obviously meant for two people which was perfect. I ordered the garden burger, wanting something different. It was spicier than I thought it was going to be but still super delicious. She order the California chicken burger. It was good but the bacon was overpowering and a little unwieldy. It had to be cut into with a fork and knife. If the music was a little quieter, It would have ended up as a 5 but I had to keep shouting in order for the host to hear me and even have a conversation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greece?start=20,2.512,2.512,2.512,2.512,2.5120000000000005
27,Rachel G.,"Rochester, NY",30,391,52.0,3.0,2014-05-02,"Meh, for some reason this particular Red Robin doesn't completely do it for me. It just seems too loud and too bright. I guess I prefer a more subdued dark and brooding atmosphere, but that is entirely subjective! I would not come here with my girlfriends, let's put it that way. The food...average, not bad, but in no way memorable either. The menu @ RR is pretty straightforward, doesn't seem to change often, which is ok, it is a burger place, but some different apps would be welcome. Cocktails can be ok, depending on the night, but expensive, considering the liquors used. Beer offerings pretty limited on the occasions we have gone. My kids do like it here, and it is good to have another option besides the food court at the mall. The service has also been very acceptable; efficient and friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greece?start=20,2.348,2.348,2.348,2.348,2.348

19,Sarah G.,"Raleigh, NC",70,433,279.0,4.0,2014-05-30,"I just visited this new Greece Ridge mall location. I LOVED IT! Let me start by saying during my pregnancy, the smell of burgers repulsed me. I thought I would NEVER be able to eat them. Like, Ever. Again. Well, 2 months after having the baby I decided to give them a try... Oh my, RED ROBIN!!! Heart! So glad I can stomach beef again! Atmosphere: I could not believe how much big this restaurant is! It has two entrances, once from the outside and one from inside the mall. The seating seems to be broken up into 4 areas: front section (nearest the outside) seemed very family-friendly with table seating (seemed a bit hectic with all the kids out there). Then there was a booth section for smaller parties or perhaps those on dates. There was also an ADULT ONLY BAR AREA (yee haw! Beat it kiddos!!) and lastly an ""indoor patio"" section, which is where we ate.  The decor was VERY modern and classy! I loved it! So ""hip and cool""! The noise level was very reasonable.  Food: Where do I start!?! So many choices it was hard to pick! Decided on the ""Burning Love"" burger. Delish!!!! Even the presentation was nice. The fries came standing in this cute metal holder... Only problem was, there wasn't many there. Luckily... They offer bottomless fries... don't mind if I do!! And the raspberry tea is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! It's unsweetened tea with a small squirt of raspberry flavor. It's not that sickening sweet tea. I want some now!!! Service: No complaints! Waitress was great! Food came quick! Price:  Yeah, a bit high but a very tasty burger and BOTTOMLESS (calorie free/fat free/guilt free) FRIES! Ok, a girl can dream. :-) Will definitely return!

What I received was a shake made with vanilla ice cream and a dribble of chocolate syrup. It was supposed to be a monster shake, and turned out to be a regular shake with the ""great"" advantage of the remaining 1/4 cup worth being given to me on the side. I ordered a chop house burger, medium-rare (I stressed at least medium) but received a well done burger that I could not even eat because of the overwhelming taste of horseradish. My husband had a blue burger, and ended up switching with me. His bun was soggy and again it screamed blue cheese so much you could not taste the meat or anything else. The bill, including a luke-warm not exceptionally tasty spinach dip, 2 burgers (over $10/pc), one ""should have been chocolate shake"" and one soda came to over $50.

However when the newest one opened at Greece Mall, I decided to finally check them out. When we first walked in it was very colorful, big and unique. The staff was very polite and helpful. We were told of a 15 min wait for a table, they asked us for our phone number, and said they would text us when the table was ready and we could go walk the mall till then. We chose to stay close by but the text came in within 15 mins as they had said. When shown our table, the chairs were very comfy and large. There is a nice bar in the back of the restaurant as well as seating outside on the ""patio"" the patio is technically still inside the mall but set up to look like the outdoors. very cool.

26,Josh G.,"Spencerport, NY",196,254,285.0,4.0,2014-10-29,"It was about time that I gave Red Robin with my girlfriend since we wanted something casual but comfortable. Did we get their gourmet burgers? Actually, we didn't all, we both went for something quite different! I was in the mood for chicken so I ordered their chicken sandwich with just lettuce on top with the bottomless fries while my dearest Kristin went for the chicken fingers. I would like to point out that I can tell why the bottomless fries, they just come in a little tin cup! Not only are they in a modest little container, they are more like wedges then ropes but nevertheless they tasted fantastic! The wait for the food wasn't even that long so my large glass of lemonade never went empty. How was the main course though? The chicken itself was fantastic but the lettuce sort of spilled everywhere when I bit into the sandwich but I managed to stuff it all in there just to enjoy the great flavor it had! I sneaked some of Kristin's chicken tenders since I was done in about ten minutes and she was on her third tender. I can say that they didn't disappoint and I was happy that I stole it from her :) The total bill came around to be about thirty dollars with added tip but even though that is a bit much for two people, I walked away feeling greatly satisfied! I guess you can say that the ambience made me feel at home. It was nicely packed with lots of people having their own conversations, a bar in one corner, and television's on the walls as most American places go. The hostess put is in the table with the large leather chairs with made the experience much more cozy and pleasant. Would I come back? Absolutely!

We were a little surprised at the amount of choices there were. It was more than we expected.

My wife ordered the Blue Ribbon, a burger with blue cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and onions with a side of regular fries and an iced tea. I had the Chili Burger with Sweet Potato fries and a Sam Adams draft beer. They gave us extra fries to eat while we were waiting but we didn't have time to finish them before our dinner arrived.

If you're going to strip me of my dignity and only give me the option of ""some pink"" and ""no pink"" instead of medium rare, you'd think they'd make it have some pink - never such luck. My burgers are consistently gray throughout the patty, which is disappointing since my favorite burger, the Royal Red Robin, would greatly benefit from ""some pink"". This visit, our milk shakes took about fifteen minutes to get to us. We almost got our burgers before we got our drinks...craziness. Our waitress was very, very nice and apologized for the wait...so whatever. They were pretty good milkshakes, but my dad remarked that he wished his chocolate malt had more malt in it. We asked to get our fries a little earlier than the burgers (we do this all the time) so we could snack on them, but we never got them.  Our orders, aside from both burgers being overcooked, were made with everything asked and our waitress recorded them correctly. I still enjoy the environment even with the token screaming toddlers bashing their parents in the head with a balloon. Other than the burgers being consistently overcooked, our no early order of fries, and the wait time on the shakes, it was still a pleasant experience thanks to our waitress Meghan, she was sweet as pie.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greece,,,,,

This, I assume is a new bun.  They just scraped off toppings, reused the bun.  (Found the same little piece of lettuce in the same spot as before.)  And we got regular fries. When we brought this up, Rosie, our server's response was that she had asked them to reset it up.  She took it back, and they made a new burger.  This new burger, was medium rare to rare.  American cheese, and had a piece of cucumber from who knows where in the  burger bun, (It had gotten covered in cheese somehow).

I went to the Greece Ridge Mall location this afternoon. I was greeted quickly at the front door and seated. My server, Kara, was super friendly throughout, and very helpful to this first-timer, explaining the various menu offerings and sauces.  I went with the ""Keep it simple"" burger, which is a plain grilled burger on a sesame seed bun served with bottomless steak fries and with lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, and pickle chips on the side. My food arrived quickly and at the desired (no pink) temperature. The burger was super tasty with great grilled flavor and juicy; certainly one of the better burgers I've had around here. The fries are well-seasoned and didn't require any extra salt. My server brought out a second batch of bottomless fries the moment I finished the first -- great timing! Both batches were hot, fresh, and delish.  I highly recommend, and will certainly try them out again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greece,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6

The sever was friendly and told us the beef is delivered daily, as well as the chicken. We ordered the crispy chicken sandwich with salad and the whiskey river chicken sandwich with fries. The crispy was super thin and almost tasted processed, very odd. The whiskey river was also thin but tasted a bit better with the toppings. We didn't get many fries, and when we asked for more near 11:00, the fryer already was shut down. The salad wasn't the freshest.

22,Bill S.,"Marietta, GA",16,11,,2.0,2016-05-06,"Very disappointing. If you go here select a burger and fries. Stay away from EVERYTHING else. The appetizers were pathetic with questionable freshness. The salad as well was with ""older"" greens. I guess it's important to eat the food that a restaurant is popular for. This will ensure freshness and turnover of the ingredients.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greece?start=20,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
3,John M.,"Rochester, NY",19,140,221.0,5.0,2016-10-14,"It's hard for me to give 5-stars to a chain restaurant - but this location has exceeded my expectations every time I've gone. The service has been outstanding each time, it's an overall well-run location. For the price and the fact you get bottomless fries, it really isn't a bad deal at all. The Red Robin Rewards program adds to that as well - there's almost always some type of coupon to use. They're automatically loaded to your account, so when you login to the tablet that's at your table, it automatically applies it to your bill. Every 10th item is free as well which is cool. All the burgers I've gotten here have been great. Always tasty, and they have a lot of different variations. There's something for everyone. The fries are always good. I've been to the Henrietta location, and the fries seem like they take a while to come out when you ask for more. Here, they come out real quick. Red Robin has their own ranch, and it's amazing. Some of the best ranch sauce I've had. And it's free. Always get some, it goes great with the fries. I have nothing bad to say about Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greece,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6
13,Alex M.,"Rochester, NY",73,14,1.0,3.0,2016-10-28,"Food is always average. Nothing amazing but nothing terrible. The prices are decent and the food is too. The staff is either very nice or really rude, there seems to be no in between with this location. Either the food comes out hot, quick and good or it's slow, cold and marginal. Rolling the dice every time you eat here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greece,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56

My salad was the size of a side salad, like it came off the lunch menu. My boyfriends burger was soggy. Bottomless fries were soggy. So disappointed.

My table basically got ignored, the server only came over to get our order and give us our food. I had to call her over in order to get a refill and didn't get offered more fires, they have a bottomless fry deal.

8,Patricia E.,"Spencerport, NY",3,12,1.0,2.0,2017-04-07,Very disappointing!  Makes me wish I had stuck to my gut feelings about chain restaurants. Ordered the steak and pepper burger. At $13.99 I would have expected a big hot juicy burger on a big fresh roll. Instead I got a lukewarm overcooked patty on a ciabatta roll that was so stale it broke apart in my hands. Four thin slices of stiff bacon criss-crossed the cheese and were sprinkled with some pepper. The fries were also lukewarm. The second round of the advertised bottomless fries were hot and fresh however. Wish that batch would have come out first.  Brownie dessert was nothing amazing - typical for a chain - and the ice cream was melting all over when she brought it out. Don't see myself going back for more of this quality.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greece,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68
9,Angilee T.,"Rochester, NY",0,57,7.0,3.0,2017-04-29,"Service was good, food was okay. Had the Bacon Cheeseburger, the Bacon tasted like it was precooked Oscar Meyer bacon, it was thin and greasy.

2,Fox E.,"Buffalo, NY",3672,4883,17415.0,2.0,2017-08-02,"I thought Robin Hood wore green? So if they were Green Robin they'd be like, taking the money from their rich customers and giving it to their servers? Well, that's half true. I have never been a fan of Red Robin and I don't think I would give them a three-star even if the Burger had been better, because service and Fries were pretty boring. However the part that really got me was that my Patty was not really piping hot when it was brought to the table. There must have been a significant period of time between it being taken off the grill and brought to me. I expect better considering how much they charge. Speaking of charge, it's $175 for half an hour.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greece,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
0,Jeremias JMan M.,"Rochester, NY",423,19,16.0,5.0,2017-08-29,"My favorite burger place on the planet. I am on a low carb diet and I find it so annoying when places want to charge you to substitute lettuce for the bun. They do it here for no charge and they will also substitute a side salad for the fries at no cost to you. They Royal Robin Burger has Bacon,Cheese and a fried egg. It is to for for. The service at this location was pretty fast if you wanted to come on your lunch break. The only negative that I could say is that it was a little cold in the restaurant area so bring a sweater or jacket with you depending on the time of year.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greece,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8
1,Heather R.,"Rochester, NY",74,73,33.0,2.0,2017-10-09,"I was pretty disappointed with my whole experience at Red Robin last night. When we got there we were told our wait would be 15 minutes but it ended up being around 1/2 hr which isn't that big of a deal but then both the meal and service weren't that impressive. The waitress was super rushed and didn't really have time to take our order (although there was only two of us and we ordered the exact same thing other then the temp the burger was cooked to) let alone give us her name.  We both ordered the Bonzi Burger- I orders mine with ""just a little pink"" and my companion ordered his well done. While the burgers concept and advertising in the menu sounded and looked really great, I found it to be really poorly put together, a huge mess in between two stale, dried out pieces of bun. I was really disappointed. The fries were luke warm, ok but not great.  Location is nice but everything else unfortunately not so great",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greece,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84
