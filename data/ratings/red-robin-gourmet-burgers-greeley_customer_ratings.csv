35,Bob S.,"Greeley, CO",0,119,,3.0,2013-03-14,"Three recent visits after a re-modeling of RR have pluses and minuses:  Pluses are the front by the bar is now more separated and is much quieter and is marked over 21 only (maybe at certain times).  The back rooms have been separated by wall hanging ""windows"" as well and are also much quieter. The minuses are the new chairs which are comfortable but which made us feel like we needed kid's booster seats.  They also get in the way of the servers when they try to navigate the areas to serve and bus tables.  The menu is very hard to read and is confusing with probably too many options.  Keep it simple.  All in all some improvements but not a great change.  The place was packed last night (Wed.) so somebody liked it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greeley?start=20,2.732,2.732,2.732,2.732,2.7320000000000007
33,Geoff S.,"Greeley, CO",1,43,9.0,3.0,2013-04-17,"Sadly almost every time we visit Red Robin in Greeley lately there are more negatives than positives. A lot of times at least one of the burgers our family orders is over cooked and ilterally hard around the edges that you can't eat about 1/4 of your burger. For the price they charge for a burger, I expect it to be cooked properly. If you complain, they always take it back and make you a new one but then that throws the whole meal out of sync as everyone else is done eating while the poor person who had to get a new burger made is sitting there waiting - makes for an unenjoyable meal. We are also not too thrilled with all of the changes they have made after their recent remodeling. They no longer wrap the burger which makes for a drippy, gross mess all over your hand and arm if you get anything with toppings. They also now serve the fries in a little metal ring instead of the basket. You get like 5 fries stuffed into this little ring. Now they advertise bottomless fries but yet they are really skimping on the serving and it takes them forever and a day if you ask for more fries. Oh and they now want to charge you for fries if they bring them before your burger which seems dumb. I can see if you are ordering something that does not include fries but why do they care if you are getting them with your order and they are supposed to be all you can eat anyway.We use to eat there a lot more often but don't go as often now.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greeley?start=20,2.732,2.732,2.732,2.732,2.7320000000000007

21,Thomas B.,"Evans, CO",0,2,,1.0,2014-11-11,"My boyfriend and I have been coming to this place for several years since we moved to Greeley. It's his favorite place, because he loves burgers, and the menu was diverse enough that I can usually get something different every time we go.  However, the last three times have been just utterly disappointing. Over the last two months, we have been three times, and the kitchen is just not performing to par. I have been served cold riblets with hot mac and cheese (I suppose that the riblets were done first?) I have ordered the ""Clucks and Shrimp"" and got two of the tiniest pieces of chicken I have ever seen there (think McDonald's chicken tenders).  Last night, we went there and I ordered a hamburger (Prime Chophouse). The server asked if I wanted pink or no pink in my burger, and I ordered it without pink. I recieved my burger, cut it in half to eat it easier (the burgers are huge, and this is a good thing), but when I took a bite, it looked like they had cooked the patty from frozen and not done it all the way through. It was cooked on the outside, but bright pink/red almost all the way through, about half an inch of uncooked meat. On top of that, I got served exactly eight fries with my order, about half of them overfried and burnt. The service has always been impeccable. Last night was no exception, and the manager was very gracious, comping my burger and offering me practically everything on the menu. I declined the additional food, but she was so very nice, and I appreciated the offer.  Bottom line; This place needs to step up their game in the kitchen. I'm so tired of getting sub-par food from this place when it used to be out-of-this-world good. And great service isn't going to be enough to keep us coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greeley?start=20,2.468,2.468,2.468,2.468,2.468

32,Amanda B.,"Loveland, CO",0,7,3.0,1.0,2015-06-15,"I went here with my daughter for lunch. It was around 3pm on a Saturday. I figured it would be an ""off"" time to go since we were pressed for time. The meal started out with my daughters drink order not being filled because the bar was backed up. She's 8 and ordered a strawberry smoothie. After 40 minutes our appetizer of chips and guacamole never arrived. Asked the waiter who told us the kitchen was backed up. All the while I was sipping my iced tea with no sweetener because none was delivered to the table. Around this same time my daughters drink came. Only it was a strawberry shake and needed to be sent back since we didn't order it. At 45 minutes of waiting our food arrived via the manager. I told him to cancel the app. He apologized and immediately brought it anyway for free. I also told him my daughter never received her smoothie so he immediately brought that as well. My salad came without the flatbread that the menu states it would have but I never mentioned it. Time to pay the bill, the app was comped by the manager but I was charged for a smoothie and a shake. It took more than 5 minutes to get waiters attention to change the bill. All in all it was close to 1 1/2 hour wait for a late afternoon salad and grilled cheese. I'm not sure if the numerous errors were the fault of the kitchen staff or our waiter but it was comical how badly things went. We don't frequent red robin often so no real loss not ever returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greeley?start=20,2.6280000000000006,2.6280000000000006,2.6280000000000006,2.6280000000000006,2.628000000000001

Made me think of a fast food burger patty. The first fries were great but our somewhat difficult to get refills were not very fresh. The service was ok. Hard to find the waitress for our refills on fries and took her a very long time to bring the desert I ordered to go.

We ordered our food, then we waited, and waited, and waited. We made jokes about them slaughtering the cows on premises, but after more waiting even those did not seem funny. When our food finally arrived, one order was wrong completely (different item on the menu), two of our orders were stone cold, and the third was okay.

If you want a lukewarm burger while eating off dirty lopsided tables with dirty silverware and lackluster servers, by all means, come to the Red Robin in Greeley.  We won't be back to this Red Robin for a very long time, if ever.  We'll make the drive to Centerra in Loveland if we need a Red Robin fix.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greeley,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92
