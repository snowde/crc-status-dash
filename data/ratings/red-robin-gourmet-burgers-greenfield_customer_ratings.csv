I hadn't been before because I try to avoid chains and I'm a vegetarian so rarely does ""burger joint"" elicit happy feelings from me. Low and behold, the wide 3 fold menu of various burger options could be turned vegetarian with their garden burger. Whoa! Very pleasant surprise! In the end, I ordered a pretty plain garden burger. It was quite good. They must make their garden burger, because it wasn't a uniform or tight disc but was instead a rice-based patty. It also came with unlimited fries. Their fries are steak-style, and I'm not a big fan in general, but these were okay.  I also ordered a margarita, but what came was a sad attempt. I would not recommend. Wrong taste, wrong texture. Other group members ordered other drinks and they looked and tasted quite good.  Very kid-friendly casual place. Friendly staff.

But, I can't go higher due to the service level that has never once improved in the times I've been there.  There's always a huge delay between putting in drink orders and receiving them, most notably with anything involving a shake or a float.  Most recently, mine was forgotten, then delivered while eating the aforementioned tasty burger.  I finished it and the burger at the same time, and, rather than offer a refill (as it's a bottomless float - and they're also bottomless fries), my plate and glass were cleared immediately. My little one also wanted ice cream.  As we parents were good without, it didn't make sense to order an entire dessert, so we asked about a scoop of vanilla for her.  Sadly, we were informed that they don't do ""just ice cream.""  And when asked about how they do ice cream for parties and the full-sized desserts,  she said they serve it then, and that my little one should be sure to come back for her birthday and laughed and walked away.  Seriously?  Wtf?

Coleslaw was fresh and crunchy and onion rings were cooked perfect.  The kids menu was creative laying out main dish, side and drink in pictures to choose from, along side sketches and games to keep the kids busy while you wait. The kiddos had pizza with apples and a corn dog with a fruit cup, both with chocolate milk. It was noisy with lots of action which was perfect for an almost 3 and 4 1/2 year old.

24,Jason B.,"Milwaukee, WI",68,370,46.0,1.0,2014-02-24,"Back in the day, Red Robin was one of my go-to spots for a good burger. Fresh, big, beefy burgers, amazing service, and amazing lemonade....how could one go wrong?  Well, Red Robin has gone wrong. At least in my eyes. The burgers have changed, for the worse big time. Smaller, frozen patties, that are overcooked, service  that is terrible (unless you are friends with the waitress and she sits down at your table like ours did on more than one occasion Saturday night) but hey, the lemonade is still good.  I was kind of shocked at how busy RR was on a Saturday night. People....don't you ever go to non-chain restaurants? I had an excuse to be there, my once a year visit for my birthday burger. Was told there would be a 25 minute wait, got a text 10 minutes later that a table was ready. That was nice.  Service was expected to be slow, and it was. However, after we ordered, things slowed down in the restaurant. So much so that our waitress was able to spend numerous 3-4 minute visits sitting at the booth across from us. They must have been VIP customers, as several waitresses took the opportunity to sit at their table. (former employees i'm guessing) It was just a bit bizarre. We were brought the wrong appetizer, and when pointed out, the guy took them to another table, and then back to the kitchen, and then brought them back out to us and said it was our lucky day and we were getting the full size appetizer. Um, yay? Burgers came out a bit later and man.....they've changed. Like I said, they used to have a really good, beefy burger. Not so much anymore. This burger was overcooked, dry, and just downright awful. It wasn't just mine either....my friend said hers left an awful feeling in her stomach, and I felt the same.

We had heard that the burgers here were awesome. I am doing WW and was praying they had some low cal options. Unfortunately, the only things for me to choose from that weren't calorie laden were some veggies, fruit, soup, BOCA burgers (that I can buy at the supermarket) and the salad topped with chicken breast that I chose. Ambience was between Applebee's and diner atmosphere.  Service was pretty slow considering we saw our waitress just standing drinking soda at the bar.  We started with the small stack of onion rings towering at 6. It came with two different sauces and was good. Next came our main dishes. My salad was huge but nothing that I can't get at McDonald's. (8.99 here) My hubby's burger reminded me of a Sonic burger. Again, nothing to write home about. It was pretty small. Our bill was $26.00. Not exactly a cheap lunch.

Tables stay dirty while people wait.  We had to ask for refills and they used to be supplied right away.  We ordered a fry refill and never got it.  I think management needs to go back to when things ran really well, because it gets worse every time we come (once or twice every month or so). Summary: Menu is great, food is great, Wait-staff is excellent, kitchen is slow, clean-up/bussing is non-existent, and often done by waiters who seem overwhelmed by lack of help.

12,Pamela M.,"Milwaukee, WI",552,566,2562.0,2.0,2015-07-02,"In my quest for good food, I don't normally find them at chains but in life, exceptions can always be made. Not so much at Red Robin. It's not the staff, that was all good. It's not the description or the promise of good food - that was there. Value?  Bonkers.  $20 bucks (with tax & tip) for a burger and fries with a diet coke.  I get this craving, honestly, once or twice per year for a burger. Red Robin is close to work (when this hankering came on) and has the lettuce wrap version like Jimmy Johns that I like (which they screwed up when my burger arrived, anyway) and I remember liking their clam chowder (although who knows if it's fresh or still good, no idea when they change the menu or food distributors - agh, gross ... Food distributors). I opted for the blue cheese burger with onion straws and some sort of spicy sauce (it wasn't), expecting all kinds of flavor. Blue cheese is one of the strongest cheeses out there. Why didn't I taste it? Must be some bunk cheese, not the good stuff. Onion straws? A pile of soggy mess with the flavor of deep frying oil.  Also went with the bottomless fries. Asked for half sweet potato and half steak fries. It's so silly the little half a cup, maybe quarter cup, they put on your plate. Yes, I get the bottomless concept, I went to college. But I don't want to ask and wait for more food. Or stop eating my burger to wait for more fries.  And pickles. Why wouldn't burgers come with pickles? That has got to be one of the cheapest and most logical accompaniments around. Stupid.

22,Allen S.,"Milwaukee, WI",2,3,,1.0,2015-08-16,"I used to love going to this place. I had a friend who used to wait tables there for a long time. I was going to try to give a positive review, but service has been poor twice in a row. We got there on a Sunday at 1:30 so I expected a wait, but we got taken to a seat right away. The waitress was quick in getting our drink orders, but then it was downhill fast as the time before. Fifteen minutes went by, and we put in our orders. It took 40 minutes for us to receive our burgers! Again I get the fact it was prime time, but 40 minutes!? I got the mushroom Swiss burger, and as you would imagine, it's full of mushrooms.  As usual (second time) there was no silver wear for me to cut my burger with, so I was picking up the greasy mushrooms with my fingers. I asked the waitress for a second order of fries right away, because once your food is delivered, you won't see them until the end of the meal. When our bill came I gave her my card and royalty card right away... Otherwise I'd be sitting another 45 minutes with greasy fingers from having to eat without silver wear. I say good food, terrible service! Go there if you want no silver wear and have two hours to eat. If your on a schedule I wouldn't ever recommend it. I wondered if it was a company policy to not give out silver wear unless asked?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greenfield?start=20,2.72,2.72,2.72,2.34,2.72

Today I went to Red Robin, I explained my dietary needs, they didn't even want to see the card. They were super accommodating, even told me the ounces of food. The children's menu actually had better choices than most places with healthy sides, many choices too. I was super impressed!  Most places have poor choices on the children's menu.

Went in last night a busy Saturday about 630pm, waited about 15 mins to be seated, no biggy there,we knew it was going to be busy.      Our server took our order, asked how we wanted our burger we both said ""little pink"" needless to say they were all pink and cold in the middle. I also asked for a second beef patty with extra cheese and without a bun...got a strange look from the server. I asked for the Red Robin special the one with the egg on top of it.. so I asked for the egg to be over medium. I ordered a sangria and what I received was something that had one cherry in it and taste like a dry Merlot with maybe some port added to it. I choked it down and put the empty glass to the end of the table, hoping when she came back to get the glass I would order a beer. The waitress was running around so fast it was hard to get a question or request in to her, she ran by the table, grabbed the glass and zoomed away, never to come back and ask if I wanted another one or something different.       Out comes the burgers, bf wasn't happy with all the raw cold meat,but liked the taste. When I ordered without a bun I asked for extra veggies, didnt get extra veggies. I even sent the egg back bc I wanted an over medium egg on top of my burger, it was over hard. ...my second egg that came back was WAY burnt and over hard again. I even specified how I wanted the egg, with the yolk running and whites hard...told her maybe do over easy and the cook might get it right since my over medium turned over hard ,I was trying to figure out how the cook was thinking but still got a burnt over hard egg.    My burger made it out but my side of broccoli came out later, nice bright broccoli, but with no butter, couldn't find server to ask for some...I really didn't want to ask for anymore since the meal was messed up from the start.    I came here about 6 months ago and was pretty happy with the food and server, but not this time.

Especially after sprinkling on some of the table side Red Robin seasoning and dipping then in a slew of dipping choices (Thai chili and sweet and spicy ketchup are my choices). I've tried multiple apps and entrees and I've never been disappointed. Service here is what turns this place from a 4-5 star place to a 3 for me. I've been to this location a handful of times and it's always a different experience. Sometimes you'll get an attentive nice server who you will have no complaints about, and sometimes you'll have a rude server who you'll also have to flag down to get a refill or my fries because they seemingly forgot about you.

18,Lindsay W.,"Oak Creek, WI",42,9,1.0,3.0,2016-06-13,"*This location is currently in the middle of renovating.  Service here is truly hit or miss. We have seemingly had great servers who are on the watch for if we need anything, and then servers who seemingly forget they are waiting on us. The biggest frustration with the servers are when they think showing you how to use the tabletop electronic payment system will be of assistance. It's not! I could have used it if I wanted to... But many folks, like me, prefer to get their orders taken the old fashion, face-to-face way. I don't think it should be assumed or implied that not using this device is doing your waiter/waitress a disservice, but some staff at this location seem to take it personally when patrons don't use it.  Food is generally great! For a place that specializes in burgers, that it super apparent. I've tried a slew of burgers here (the Banzai being my new favorite) and they are each grilled the way you ask for them and super flavorful. It's easy to substitute buns for a lettuce wrapped burgers for less cals, or bottomless French fries for bottomless other sides (fruit, veggies, soup, etc.). It's great that the menu is so customizable. The one thing I would stray away from is the chicken. The last time I ordered chicken, it was on a salad and it was severely underdone. They got me fresh new chicken, and it was inedible. Their response to my frustration was that they are going through a new vendor for their chicken products and there have been a lot of complaints about it by others, as well. My recommendation is to just plain stay away from grilled chicken sandwiches, wraps and salads in order to avoid disappointment.  Overall, this is a decent place to dine, with the extreme upside being the quality of the burgers/fries and the occasional super attentive wait staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greenfield,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006

Am I supposed to eat my burger get full them try to eat some wings with 2 pieces of crumbled  blue cheese on them. 4th: I thought a burger cooked medium meant it wasn't pink, I guess Red Robin cooks have a different idea of what medium burger looks like. I'm afraid for my friends lives who ate these raw burgers. 5th: eating is hard to do with no napkins or silverware. That's the case for this meal when i was served my food with nothing to assist in eating and cleaning myself and wiping and touching. 6th: the dollar cheese on my chicken sandwich.

We are used to seeing management staff checking in with the tables. This manager did none of that nor did he assist his staff. He just seemed to be checking restaurant functions on a terminal.
