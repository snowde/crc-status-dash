This Red Robin was clean and the service was well kept. I ordered an iced tea which somehow got lost in translation as Hi-C, but I'll chalk that up to my yankee accent...because a passing waitress quickly rectified it. I had the California burger.

77,Duane H.,"Seattle, WA",27,4,,1.0,2012-07-19,"I called in an order for a Ghost style tavern burger.  I had a free burger for my upcoming birthday. I ordered it to go with honey mustard and campfire sauce.  When I arrived at the restaurant (extremely slow inside) I had to wait for well over five minutes as employees just kept walking past me telling me it would be a few minutes. A few of them just walked past me and were standing behind the line goofing off, laughing. Finally somebody asked if I wanted to sit in the bar or the restaurant. Told them I was here to pick up a to go order.  I was directed to the bar area to speak with the bartender.  I asked him if both of my sauces were in my box of food and he said yes.  I got home in less than five minutes to find that my fries were already cold all the way through and neither one of my sauces were in the box.  The only sauce that they had given me were a few mustard and ketchup packets which I specifically told him I did not want when I was standing there waiting for my food. I've been going to Red Robin locations in the Seattle and Tacoma area for years and have always enjoyed the level of service and food immensely. I had several birthday parties in a row there!

Now, being a chili freak, I can't say they have a sophisticated chili system. Mostly it tastes like they dumped a LOT of chili powder in a pot and added some beans and meat. It works, though, when the craving hits. One minor gripe about that is, at this location, it seems to have gotten a lot saltier in recent times. Borders on pucker-up levels of salty at times. If they dialed back on that, my chili powder bomb would be perfect. We don't tend to have issues with service or overcrowding because, come on. It's Woodruff Road. If you're out there in that mess on a weekend and giving lousy reviews for delays, you kinda are asking for a bad time. Stick to off peak times and cool your jets if it's busy. They're servers, not indentured servants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greenville?start=20,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.7039999999999997,3.0000000000000004

My husband wasn't as pleased with the Banzai burger. There wasn't anything wrong with the food, it just didn't fit what he was craving. He would recommend more lineapple, though.

Our server claimed no one told her she had to serve us, and promised that she'd make it up to us (which she never did). Our food took another 45 minutes to come out. The burger and fries were good, but the service was below par. Our server seemed less than enthusiastic maybe because she was tired, or she was not good at her job. The good food does not compensate for the bad service.  Also, I saw a host/server brush crumbs off the table next to us with his bare hands. And the floor at that table was dirty with fries, crayons, food from the previous  customers.

35,Phil L.,"Greenville, SC",1,8,1.0,1.0,2016-04-23,"I should have lowered my expectations as soon as my boyfriend walked in a accurately noted that it smelled like Burger King. We came here because my boyfriend wanted McDonald's so I thought this was a good compromise. Should have just gone to McD's because it would have been about the same for about $40 less. Not that I'm a fan of fast food, but these comparisons should tell you all you need to know.  My biggest complaint is the Not Your Father's Root Beer Float. I like the beer so thought this would be fun, but for $7.49 I could have gotten a six pack and made it myself at home better than this. It probably sat at the bar for way too long because the foam had disappeared and the glass looked half empty by the time I got it. No spoon and the straw was way too short for the glass, so I kept having to dig for it and then finally turn the absurdly large glass upside down to finish it. I feel like a root beer float, alcoholic or not, is meant to be drank through a straw.  We also ordered Banzai boneless wings as an app, which were pretty good, but the chips they are served with were cold although kind of crispy. The waitress said they were supposed to be, but I think this was another case of waiting too long in the window. On the topic of service, the server was nice enough but they have these little touch screen devices on the tables to play games, order appetizers, pay, et cetera. Seems like a way to cut costs at the expense of service. While I've seen them in other restaurants, the amount of time she spent explaining how to order and appetizer off of it could have better spent offering her suggestions on a good starter. I'd much rather have a friendly server to interact with than a robot. I will say the burgers and fries were alright, but nothing above average. Again, not a fan of cheap fast food, but I would have been equally satisfied for much less cost going to the Golden Arches. Don't blow your money here, there a plenty of other great burger and fries joints on Woodruff-many locally owned- that would be more affordable and better quality that this. I know traffic can be awful, but even if you're famished it would be worth the extra few minutes. Actually, Carolina Ale House is in .1 miles away and much better than this, even though I've only been to the one downtown I can assure its better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greenville,2.68,2.68,2.68,2.5640000000000005,2.68

Last time, our server was in charge of a big table behind us that appeared to have many problems to the point that a manager had to assist. It totally took over her attention. We were neglected. We maybe saw her twice. Our appetizer came out before our drinks did. Our food was brought out by other servers with things missing. Usually your server comes to see you shortly to make sure you have all you need. She never did. We decided to eat it anyway so it wouldn't get cold but none of us had any more drinks and we were scared to eat unless we had something to drink since she had proved to be so preoccupied.

C'Mon Man! I like the burgers, they are very creative with their topping and presentation, but they are pricey. The service was good, but I do understand what the other reviews say about the hustle and bustle and it could be an issue.  The only issue I had was getting water refill.  I ordered the Burning Love burger, which is a burger topped with fried jalapeño coins, salsa, Pepper-Jack, lettuce, tomatoes and chipotle aioli on a jalapeño-cornmeal kaiser roll.  I also ordered it with ""some pink"" but it was ""no pink"" (that was the server's terminology).  It was $10.89.  My guests had a black and bleu angus burger each and they were $14.89 each.  My burger arrived with a char grilled large jalapeno pepper pinned to the top of it.  It looked really cool but was pretty hot, so about mid way through eating it, the server stopped by to refill my water.  This means they take your glass away to go and refill it elsewhere. Not normally a problem, right?  Unless they don't come back and your eating a giant char grilled jalapeno that looks really cool...waiting....waiting..and here she comes with someone else food an not with my water.  I did get it after probably 5 minutes but that was an uncomfortable five minutes and my fries were fairly dry too.  Burger was kind of dry too, wound up dipping the last few bites into ketchup since that outer edge had run out of the chipotle aioli.

I had heard some positive things about RR from other people so I was excited to get a chance to go and try them out. However, my experience was so bad that I will NOT go back.  The problem seems to be in their service model rather than the food. Here's my story: The fish was nicely done and crisp the way I like it. I got four  pieces about 4 inches long and 2 inches wide. $13+ was a little pricey, but I can let that slide. Their dish also comes with bottomless fries, and that was where the first problem developed. The first round of bottomless fries were like scrapings from the kitchen. Little chunks of potatoes and a few so-so fries. There were not many (hidden under the fish) so they disappeared quickly. So did the server!  My wife and I (she ordered the same dish) each wanted more, per the bottomless fries promise, but our server was not to be found. Finally I got up and went to the staging area / staff lounge and explained that I could not find my server and needed more fries. They said they would bring more fries right away. Many minutes later, our server appeared with ONE tiny tray of fries (perhaps a dozen total). I had asked for two. She grunted and went to get another which she brought back within a minute or two. She explained that she had several tables all around the restaurant and that's why I couldn't find her. Indeed, we never saw her again for 10 more minutes, at which time I walked over to her and again asked for TWO servings of fries. To her credit she brought them right away.  The next time I saw her was when she brought the bill ... and finally filled our empty glasses of water. Nobody had refilled our initial glass of water for 25 minutes! Then, as I went to pay using the required tabletop credit card processor, I did not get a receipt because it was stuck or out of paper. Think I could fine our server? NO! We were done so I asked for a manager and requested a copy of my receipt, a process that took him 4-5 minutes. I also explained to him the issues we had and he said he was sorry and just looked at  me like it was no surprise. In retrospect, I think the biggest issue is that they seem to scatter their servers around the restaurant. I know that is a more antiquated business model still used by a few chains. I never have understood why some restaurants think that is better than having their servers work a zone and pay attention to their patrons. The ""disappearing server"" model is a good way to irritate a lot of people.  My guess is that this restaurant chain continues because the food is quite tasty if you don't need any service from the time the food arrives until you are ready to leave. In Greenville, we have better options and I will let my money speak elsewhere!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greenville,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92

Our visit was great. Kevin our server was humorous and great as a server. Our food came quickly, it was hot and delicious. Kevin was quick with the refills and offered to go beverages. Will visit again when in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greenville,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92
20,Nita B.,"Travelers Rest, SC",130,237,161.0,4.0,2017-12-15,"We had not been to Red Robin in quite awhile due to a bad experience, well that has definitely changed. From the time we walked in till we walked out they had excellent customer service. Casey took care of us and she was fantastic. I had the build your own with fruit and my daughter had the BBQ bacon. Our only regret was we didn't share . These are big burgers. My daughter was offered more fries and I more fruit but we declined as we couldn't finish what we had . They have a extensive drink menu to please everyone. If you find room , the dessert menu looked amazing. We will not wait so long to return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greenville,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005

23,Tammy B.,"Simpsonville, SC",10,1,,1.0,2017-12-30,This is now my third time going to this restaurant. Each time my experience has been bad. Seems this time there was no silverware. I ordered a Red Robin burger and got a plain burger. The waitress carried it to the back then brought it out the same. I sent it back and the manager was supposed to come out but never showed up. We finally left. The restaurant was dirty. Not impressed- especially since Red Robin is one of my favorite places. Very sad at the standard and quality.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-greenville,3.08,3.08,3.08,,3.0800000000000005
