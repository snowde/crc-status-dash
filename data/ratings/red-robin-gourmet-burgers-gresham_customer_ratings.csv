Our waitress was super friendly & helpful bringing out several varieties of fries & sauce to go with.  People-order your fries crunchy with garlic - you won't be sorry!  The burgers were great! Cooked to perfection (which to me is not ""vulcanized"")-I like my burger pink and they obliged- thank you!

102,David R.,"Bend, OR",43,7,24.0,3.0,2012-04-01,"What is there to say about Red Robin that hasn't already been said?  The food is uninspired and just alright, the atmosphere is bright, cheerful and chaotic and the service is usually friendly (albeit, almost too friendly).  The Division Location is our local Red Robin and has become the standby safety-net for a place to take our kids out to dinner. From this perspective RR offers a comfortable dining experience because the kids are truly given some leeway to be themselves (a little louder, a little squirmier, etc.) I do have to admit that I might have a slight addiction to their fries and seasoning salt. And while you won't be offered any culinary epiphanies, you will probably leave full and mostly satisfied. For the (usually) good customer service and as a reliable family dining destination - 3 stars seem appropriate for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-gresham?start=140,2.444,2.444,2.444,2.444,2.444

Well, he was very rude and unhelpful toward the situation.  So as I waited for my bill, the table next to me, a mom and her two kids said to me...""We witnessed the whole incident, you shouldn't have to pay a penny for your food, they were totally in the wrong and you were right to call him out on not serving your food before stopping and chatting with his friends.  Well, the Manager Damon never came back out to say anything.  The lady and her two kids came over to me and said to my kids, ""your mom was in the right, don't be embarrassed, you have to stand up for yourself and you should be proud of her"".  Her oldest daughter even came over and said ""I know its none of my business, but I am so sorry that happened to you  tonight"", and she gave me a hug.  I will never go to this establishment again, they have lost a long time customer that used to think a lot of this franchise.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-gresham?start=140,2.212,2.212,2.212,2.212,2.212

129,Kari N.,"Portland, OR",61,31,94.0,3.0,2012-07-15,"So, I am a huge Red Robin fan. This particular restaurant is always busy. I understand that times can be hectic so I try not to complain too much.  My most recent visit at this location, I was given my food after about twenty minutes from ordering, without the basket of fries I requested before our food came. I asked for my chicken to be plain grilled and it came with sauce on it. I let the waitress know what I had asked for and she told me to ""scrape it off"". I was taken back at the fact she actually said that to me. I was speechless.  When our actual server, Shannon, came back to ask if everything came out right I told her what happened and she was shocked too. BTW we still didn't have our basket of fries. She apologized for the previous waitress and brought us our fries. (note I care about the fries because I have a 3yr old and a 4yr old who were starving). A few moments later the manager, Colleen, came and apologized for what had happened (she also brought us a second basket of fries) and was very nice about what had happened. She thanked us for our business, for telling Shannon what happened and she said our meal was on the house.  I truly didn't expect her to do that. I respect her for the way she handled the situation and I love that she came to apologize in person. She proved to me she takes care of her customers and the business. Colleen and Shannon's behavior and professionalism would make me want to come back to this location. We did leave a tip because it was not their service that was disrespectful, just the waitress that gave us the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-gresham?start=120,2.412,2.412,2.412,2.412,2.412

118,Phill Y.,Bay Area,0,83,,4.0,2012-08-07,"Atmosphere 3 Service 4 Food 4 For a ""casual sit down"" chain restaurant, this location of Red Robin is actually pretty good. Parking at Gresham Station is a breeze. However, we had two seniors in the group and the ramp from the parking lot is pretty long. Plus, it's loud, but all RRs are loud!   Our party of 9 (well, 2 seniors, 1 baby, 1 toddler, and 5 full fledged eaters) arrived at 6:30 on a Sunday night and were seated within 15 minutes.  I thought our server was friendly and efficient. Our server returned every few minutes with drink refills and extra baskets of fries without having our having to ask. Very much on top of the needs of our table.  In fact, the only time I had to flag someone else down was to take check and my credit card.  Unlike other casual sit downs, the food is consistent from visit to visit.  Our order: *** bacon cheeseburger *** blt *** kid's mac & cheese *** grilled chicken salad *** 4 orders of fish and chips *** drinks NOTE:  for a party our size, they automatically ADD an 18% gratuity. The nice thing on the check is that they have this as a separate line item on the credit card slip under the subtotal.  Then they have another line marked ""additional tip"" so you can't miss the fact they've already added a gratuity right above this line.

Only saving grace is their French Onion Soup. Bottomless fries don't impress me. Especially when you have to hunt for your waitress. I guess if you ask them to not let the food get cold, it might be worth trying. Again, this all comes down to poor management. Mall 205 location is ran better.

109,Shane S.,"Gresham, OR",0,3,,1.0,2014-12-09,Me and my family have been going to Red Robin for many years. It seems lately the service has been lacking and it also seems to me that the staff  really don't care.  We have always liked your french fries and that is what probably kept us coming back. Tonight I purchased two $25 gift cards that came with 2 $5 bonus gift cards. I understand how the $5 bonus gift card works.  What these businesses are trying to do is to have you come back in the following year to revisit their establishment. This is a good business practice and is widely used among businesses. However Red Robin expects you not to use the $25 that you purchase with your own cash that same day. Red Robin needs to understand that we are purchasing those $25 gift card with our own cash. We should be allowed to use those at any time we want to use them. I have purchased many gift cards during this holiday season and receive bonus cards by these businesses when purchasing these gift cards I have been able to use them at any time even right after the purchase because again this is my money I'm using this is not a bonus. I will not be told by Red Robin how I can use my money once I purchase of gift cards I should be allowed to use him whenever I feel.

Now a soggy mess. So I order it with no bun. Not the same. Last time I visited the Gresham location I ordered garlic fries and putting garlic powder about the same as your red robin season doesn't count. Especially charging .99 cents. I complained and the guy said it was a thing they were testing but they were the only location. It SUCKED!!! So I wrote on the survey. So I got a gift card for my birthday  (only reason we went in again) Friday night 8pm 2 adults 2 kids. A family of 3 walks in after us gets sat before us. As we walk by I notice there at a 4 top....what's up with that? My fries again no garlic but some salt poured on with cheese. NOT the same and and how do you charge for that? Horrible. The chicken taste more fake and chewy. The lemonade almost $5. The whiskey river BBQ burger also changed the onions out dried crusty onions on it now.

Was promptly seated and informed we were to receive a free appetizer. Okay, seems fair. It took 15 minutes for our waitress to come over and get our drink and appetizer orders. Those arrived within 10 or so minutes.  Ordered our main meals and continued to wait for over an hour for 2 cheeseburgers and a kids spaghetti. All while having empty drinks for 20+ minutes.  For the wait, our waitress said we got both of our appetizers for free. Cool, I could live with that.  Until I realized I was given the wrong burger. The burger was comped as well.  Now, I know it was not our waitress' fault, as everyone in kitchen looked frazzled and orders were sitting there for well over what they are supposed to be.

One visit we had we were greeted by a rather unpleasant hostess. She tried to seat us at the worst table in the restaurant (right next to the opening to the kitchen and prep areas), and we were maybe the 4th group of people to enter since they just opened. When we requested a different table, we got a snarky/exasperated ""Okay"", like we were doing her a disservice.  This past weekend was a different experience, but still sucky. My mother ordered a fish sandwich with a side of fruit (extra $0.49, no big). When she received the fruit side, it looked like it had been sitting in the hot sun for hours after being completely macerated. You know when you get a muffin that has fruit in it, but the fruit looks all soggy and old and weird? It was like that, but in a bowl. And all of the fruit was stained red by the old as hell soggy ""strawberries"". When she complained (rightfully), they took the side away and told her that because she requested a side that cost extra, they wouldn't make up for the crappy food they offered (those may or may not be my words, not theirs). The waitress was very friendly, and we tipped her well because she tried so hard. It was the management that refused to make up for the nasty food we were served. Don't call it ""fresh fruit"" when I could pull something more fresh out of a cow's butthole.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-gresham?start=120,2.4,2.4,2.4,1.736,2.4

We came in during a period of time where it shouldn't have been busy and from all the empty tables we saw it wasn't busy at all. But we still had a 15 minute wait for a table.  Once we were seated it took about another 15 minutes till we saw our server, which is fine, it gave us enough time to decide what we wanted to order. But when he came by to take our order he ran away after our drink order before he could take our food order. Then it was about another 15 minutes till we saw him come back with our drink order which consisted of a whopping 4 waters. We order our food finally after repeating ourselves many times which made us feel like he wasn't really listening to us.  Then one of our party inquired about a spicy sauce option and the server suggested ketchup. Not joking. Finally he decided on the sweet Thai sauce but was not informed of the charge for it until the bill came.  Our food didn't take too long to come up but of course it came out wrong so that took some time to correct. Not much attention was paid to our table after that. We had to request water ourselves and finally got a chance to order more fries. But after 15 minutes waiting for more water and the fries only the water came out. Apparently they were out of fries. Ok fine we've already been here over an hour what's some more time for fresh fries. Another 15 minutes goes by and we can see fries waiting under the heat lamp.

The second we visited the service was much better. We had a great server who made sure to check on us and made sure our dining experience was good. The food was good and our waters were frequently filled. I will say though the amount of fries they give you was very little for each dish we ordered. We asked for a second helping (2 baskets) and also felt like they were being skimpy with their bottomless fries. I am sure this is something they do to limit waste. But at the same time there was two adults and two teenagers in our group you would think they would give you more than just two medium fries. The price is on the expensive side for a burger and fries kind of place. Since our service was better the second time around we will probably be coming back.

They changed the bread on it and what was served was charred to the point of being unedible.

165,Sam M.,"Gresham, OR",0,2,,2.0,2015-10-05,"This place is such a joke. If the high prices for mediocre quality doesn't turn you away the corporate business feel probably will. They don't carry any unique beer, just over prices coors and bud light on their ""all day happy hour"". Their touch screens literally charge you for everything, like if I'm already buying beer and a huge meal with sides don't you think you could spare me the 2 dollars to play some damn trivia with my wife? If that's not enough for you their service is probably the biggest joke of all. I mentioned my wife is pregnant and feeling sick and asked to get the fries to my order early but they said they can't do that and have to charge me 2 bucks for a side, which okay whatever. Their all young kids, which is fine except for the fact they run a restaurant like a fast food joint.  Everything is noticeably dirty especially the glasses and silverware. They messed up my order, I asked for a black and blue burger and I got the regular blue cheese burger and my wife got a gourmet burger but he gave us the wrong kind, she had asked for sauce on the side which we didn't get. The waiter at the bar didn't even write anything down and another coworker tried to ask him something in the middle of our order and he rudely talked to her across the bar for a second.  All they offered us was to remake our order but my wife had to be to work soon so that wasn't an option. Which sucks because she is pregnant and it made her feel sick since we waited so long without eating. Best part? They didn't offer us ONE single thing. The manager just said ""oh well I'm sorry"". I regret not making a bigger deal of it. You know it's a dirty place when they remodel the lobby but don't even touch the kitchen. This is the first time I have had my day genuinely ruined by a restaurant. You have no idea the hell I had to pay after we left. Thanks red robin.

We could clearly see the kitchen cooks had finished multiple meals laying across the kitchen counter waiting to be served. I actually timed it and the food that sat there took 10-15 mins before it was brought out to the tables. By the table we received our food the fries were not hot, they were cold and soggy already. Even the other fries that they brought afterwards was not fresh. The onion rings and boneless wings were not hot either. Even our burgers that they brought out was not warm enough. You could tell it had been sitting there before they brought it out because the cheese looked like plastic. I was very disappointed and I'm not the one to complain at a restaurant. We were a party of 2 adults and a 4 yr old that spent $60 there, I would've expected fresh cooked dinner. I understand that location gets pretty busy but I think they should get more help to prevent that from happening. I gave it a 2 stars just because the server was extremely nice. But other than that..

Maybe if you pay a few bucks more and opt for one of their ""gourmet"" burgers it might be better.  We went there yesterday on a $25 gift card from work. We were promptly seated by the hostess. The waiter arrived immediately asking for our drink order. ""Geeze give me a chance to open the menu to see what choices I have"", I thought. We ordered one peach iced tea (very good, not overly sweet) and one hot tea.  We then decided to split a bacon guacamole cheese burger with fries and a Caesar salad. Yet another person came out and served our food. They are paying three people to service each table.   Pretty good tasting burger, Sysco frozen patty, but almost non existent guac. Just a very very light smear. Not as good as the one you get at Carl's Jr. for half the price. Steak fries were better than what you get at a fast food joint, and a much better choice of dipping sauces for sure. I liked the house seasoning salt. The burger needed it as well, because it was not at all seasoned. The Caesar salad was ok. Pretty good house made dressing (I asked). One napkin each, no others in sight. Here's where things went south. The very friendly and attentive (up to now) waiter asked if he could get us anything else...fries, drink refill, etc. We said yes we would like some more fries. He said he would get them going for us. He disappeared for a minute, then came out and proceeded to talk to the couple seated behind us about his college education, computer skills, etc. Several minutes passed, fries never came out. Then on his way back into the kitchen, he asked us if he could get us anything else. I said yes some more French fries please. He said I'll get them going for you. I thought ok, simple mistake, he forgot. He then came back out and proceeded to finish his conversation with the couple again. This went on until we finished our lunch. Still no fries. When we called him over to help us run the card to pay the bill on the complicated I pad system, he asked. Can I get you anything else? I said, Well we were waiting for some more fries, but we don't need them now. He acted surprised, and said can I get you some in a to go container? I said no thanks, they don't heat up well. So in summary, almost $22 for one fast food style burger, a slightly larger than side salad, one small order of fries and two drinks? Twice forgotten ""endless"" fries? Not worth it in my opinion. I would have felt even worse if I had used my own money. He only got the remainder of the $25 card for his tip.

134,Michelle M.,"Gresham, OR",0,7,1.0,2.0,2016-03-26,"I recently visited this red robin on A busy Friday night. We had to wait a little longer to get a booth which was fine. Once we were seated we waited for about five minutes and already knew what we wanted. This was my third time here since they introduced tablets at the tables. I proceeded to order from the tablet however in order to order you had to call the server, which is silly . I pressed the call server button the server came over immediately with a attitude. Almost as if she had worked a really long shift and was at her wits end. When ordering appetizers she talked down to us, when I had questions about things she seemed annoyed to answer. We went ahead and placed our order she took the tablet and walked away . I believe it was the manager that came over and asked us how we were doing I let her know that I didn't know if Our order actually went in as the server took the tablet and just walked away. We had ordered a root beer float which came in 2 cups . one filled with ice cream the other one filled with root beer, we had to wait 20 minutes for appetizers only to have the wrong one sent to us. We then waited an additional 10 minutes for the correct appetizers only to have our entrées arrive five minutes after the appetizers. Before the appetizers were sent out I asked if a basket of fries could be sent for my daughter because she was really hungry. They absolutely made no effort to bring any fries while we had to sit there and wait for these appetizers. We asked for condiments to be brought to the table such as ranch and hot sauce which weren't provided at any time To add insult to injury the waitress rarely came by to check on us and when she did she had an attitude. On top of all of this we came to red Robin because it was my daughter's fourth birthday and she really enjoys coming here . The waitress had other tables that she was helping which when interacting with those customers she seemed upbeat and friendly. The table behind us had two little girls and she even offered to give them one of the red Robin balloons .As we were leaving the restaurant the waitress made a last ditch effort to perk up her attitude because I believe she saw me giving her a negative survey on the tablet and offered my daughter a red Robin balloon which I thought was very nice. Only to come back to my daughter and tell her that they had no more balloons. Nobody could blow any up, I guess they were just all out. I'm not sure if she was really having a bad day or if it was just the end of a long shift but I am very disappointed in the interaction that I had with the waitress. Especially considering that when she interacted with other tables she was nowhere near the way she was with me . Keep in mind that she was like this from literally the time that we sat down until the time that we left so I know that it could not be anything that myself or anybody with me was doing. The food was decent and I bothered to give her a tip even though I feel we deserve a lot better customer service.

A chain restaurant should be predictable Most red robins you go to you know what you're getting into when you get it this location in particular has not been that way in the recent past this place has just gone downhill further and further. I hate to post bad things about a chain restaurant so I'm only posting about this location.  the management needs serious work here! The food never seems to be predictable and they can't cook a burger to specification to save their lives! I'm sure the cooks are over pressured and understaffed from what it looks like inside this restaurant so I can't just blame the staff more of a management issue I spoke with the ""assistant manager"" Steve,  he seemed less than concerned about my family experiences in the recent past including my last and final one at this location unless management practices change. The way that they handle complaints appeared to me that they had been receiving many complaints and just didn't care or didn't have the resources to care. Either way I would skip this red Robin location if you're in the area there's plenty of better options right next-door to people who actually want your money.  P.s.  If you are using Red Robin rewards they will make a spectacle every single time and still not follow through with the deals that you earned or posted on your rewards membership website.

57,Kay H.,"Fairview, OR",1,8,,3.0,2016-09-27,"Very interesting experience.  Got there about 5:30 and there were about 4 other parties waiting to be seated with no employees in sight. Usually they greet you at the door. When someone showed up we ask to sit in the bar and were told to just go in. That didn't work. They have changed the seating to very tall seats and the tables are right on top of each other. No human of normal height would be comfortable. Went back out and were told it would be about a 10 minute wait. We were seated ahead of some others that had been there longer. Couldn't believe that people had to wait. There were empty tables and booths everywhere. Our waiter was very good and fast and took our drink order. My husband order a  Bourbon and seven. When he brought it, I asked my husband if there was any booze in it. It had absolutely no color at all. Looked like a small glass of 7up. You could smell a faint hint of booze, but bourbon usually adds a brown color to a drink. Not in this case. He decided to just drink it and not order another one. Our dinners came out fine. I ordered a Cobb salad and although it was not as big as they used to be, it was fine. Funny thing is they call it an avo-Cobb and brag about the avocado in it. You have to look pretty hard to find it! My husband ordered the Tavern double and although it doesn't look as tasty as the picture, it was good and free so you can't complain. My salad was supposed to come with garlic toast and didn't. I called the waiter and he went immediately and got it. He came back with 3 very small ""bricks"" that you couldn't even bite into. Again, like the drink, we decided that it wasn't that important. We weren't going to mention anything until the bill came. The drink was $4.29. I told my husband that was way too much for a glass of pop and decided to say something. The poor waiter was very apologetic and went and got the manager. Not only was the drink a problem, but they charge $1.99 entertainment fee. I asked what it was. It seems the gaming box on the table that you call your waiter through and pay your bill through, also charges you if you just look at it. A couple of comments were made that others had complained about this and the quality of the drinks. He did take the price of they drink and the entertainment fee off. He was very apologetic and nice about it. And again, the waiter did a very good job and was tipped accordingly. We will think long and hard about going back. Something has happened at this location. They need some major revamping. It shows something when at the height of dinner time, the place is so empty.

It seems each time we go - this is our local RR, and one we've eaten at several times - the portion sizes get smaller, the service, while still friendly, is focused more on how they can continue to charge the same prices for smaller portions (the burgers are smaller than ones I get at 5 Guys, or even Carl's Jr) while you cashier yourself. My son and wife both got literally 5 steak fries with their meals. Granted, it was bottomless..but we always feel like they are being 'cheap' whenever we eat there. What do we get out of it? Certainly not a break on pricing.  I have yet to figure out the seating situation there as well. We showed up early for dinner, with literally dozens of open tables, yet there was a 15 minute wait. Why? The good? I like their creative entrees, and the food tastes good..at least they are trying new items, too bad there isn't much substance to them. Not to sound like ""get off my lawn"" guy, but in the past, I remember their burgers, nachos, etc portion sizes being impressive.

In the early afternoon, the restaurant is often crowded and it takes a significant amount of time to get seated and then to get food.

The first time I ordered it took over an hour and a half before I received my food because they had written down the wrong street (16th instead of 15th) when I had to call in my order.  After waiting 45 minutes, I tried and tried to call the restaurant to no avail.  I finally received a call from the poor delivery girl who'd been driving around looking for the wrong street.  My address was supposed to have been corrected after that, but tonight I discovered that it hadn't been.  I gave them a second chance and the same thing happened.  Extremely disappointing, especially since I'm in the middle of a move and was tired and hungry!

He should have just stayed home and rested his legs instead of coming in to work.  I ordered a burger with a substitute boca burger and no cheese or onions. I thought my order was kind of complicated but the server didn't even bother writing it down so I assumed he had great memory. When I got my burger it had cheese in it. I didn't really care at that point because I was super hungry but I wanted to ask to make sure I got the boca burger and not the garden burger. The manager came and told me to cut into it so she could get a better look. She said it looked like the boca burger but she didn't seem too sure either but she took my burger back in to remake it. When I finally got my burger, my whole table was already done eating and I swear it was still a garden burger! I could feel the cheese stretch when I took a bite. This is unacceptable.

2,Tyler S.,"Gresham, OR",10,7,,2.0,2017-10-07,"**This is a long review, but if you want the truth, read it all** Red Robin has been around for many years. I've been going since they had the Robin bird all over their menu. But now the place is more modern and not as kid friendly it seems. But let's not let that get in the way of the main details here. I've pretty much got a run down of this place. I've dined in, got it to go, and had it delivered many times. And this is gonna be a bit long but if you want the truth, keep reading. So first off let's get the food straight. I've always loved it. I think it's delicious and their bottomless steak fries with their signature seasoning and ranch is absolutely heaven to me. But when it comes to to go orders and delivery. That seems to fall flat. If you want a fresh experience, dine in. You'll most likely get fresh hot food. However the service varies. Sometimes their service is over the top excellent. Decent. Or down right horrible. But we will get on about the service in a bit. Let's start with their new delivery experience. I've gotten delivery several times (cause who doesn't like food brought to them?). And not once has it been on time. I've had it come between 20-40 minutes earlier each and every single time. Which can be quite annoying especially if you're out and about and are planning on coming home at a certain time and get ready to eat. Which has happened once. The food comes in a ""hot box"" but I've never had it really tasting fresh. It tastes like it was sat out for about 10 minutes then delivered. The people are generally nice, you sign and they're on there way. Pretty simple. I'd give delivery in itself, a 3/5. It needs work, but is a good concept. Now the To Go order.. This was terrible. We were told to come in about 50 minutes to pick it up. We arrive at the 50 minute mark and they let the people know in the back that I'm here to pick up the order... AN HOUR goes by. Yes. A whole hour. So I check in on them, and they repeat that I'm there for my order as if I haven't even showed up before. Then, another 10 minutes and we finally get the food. Were annoyed so I don't really check to see if I have everything. And of course, I don't. I ask for tons of seasoning for the fries. But got not one. I would never recommend a to go order after that experience. 1/5.. Now the service. Usually pretty good. But I have an African American friend who's brother was racially profiled at the joint. As he was told he had to pay before for his meal before ordering and that his Caucasian girlfriend could pay after. The reason was they said they saw him dine and dash on the cameras. Yet, the manager states there were no cameras. So because of my friends brothers recent experience, it really makes it hard for me to respect this place. I give it a two as I have hope. I enjoy their food and have had absolutely wonderful times there. But they need to clean house. Red Robin is good at innovation and keeping things fresh, but what they need to focus on is who they hire and how to get things done right. As people, can really make a difference.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-gresham,1.8,1.99,1.99,,1.9140000000000001
