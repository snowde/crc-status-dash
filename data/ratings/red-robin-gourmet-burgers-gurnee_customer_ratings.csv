I had the Burnin' Love Burger and it was a nice not-too-spicy burger.  I love the addition of the deep fried jalapeno coins! The dessert was off the charts!  I asked for the Nestle Toll House Cookie Sandwich and the waitress said it would be a 7 minute wait as the cookie is made fresh to order!!  Can you say WELL WORTH THE WAIT!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-gurnee?start=40,2.9600000000000004,2.9600000000000004,2.9600000000000004,2.9600000000000004,2.9600000000000004

They make a very good burger and the bottomless fries are a nice touch.  When I was being seated I overheard the manager apologizing to the people, at the next table, for some type of mix-up.  This did not instill confidence in me, that my visit was going to be a good one, right from the start.  I asked the person, who was taking our drink order, what beers they had, on tap, that were either microbrews or imports and she told me they had Miller, Bud, Sam Adams and then had to refer me to the menu for others. I would expect a server to know what is at the bar and on the menu. Not so here.  I was also priviledged to be able to watch 3 employees sitting at a booth chatting during business hours. Two of which were groping each another. Obviously boyfriend / girlfriend. The manager was completely oblivious as he walked by them several times. Not exactly what I wanted to see when eating my meal.  There was one server who was wiping off the lights, over the tables, right next to people who were eating their meals. VERY unsanitary.   It doesn't matter, how good the food is, if the service, atmosphere, and management are not up to standard.

The burger was good but the swiss cheese wasn't a hit. The toasted pretzel bun was good and it absorbs moisture very well, so the bread doesn't get soggy like regular burger buns.

74,Thomas K.,"Lake County, IL",38,59,18.0,2.0,2012-09-29,"We noted that three groups of people were seated in the waiting area when we arrived, though there were at least six empty tables that were immediately visible; evidence of short staffing. The hostess advised us that there would be a ten to fifteen minute wait to be seated unless we cared to be seated at their ""full service bar"". We opted for bar seating.   We sat at the center of the bar for five minutes, and were passed by the bartender at least three times before he as much as acknowledged our presence, after he paused to look at the televised football game directly in front of us, turn around and offer his opinion to patrons seated at the end of the bar. THEN the bartender acknowledged us and asked for our drink order. We were handed menus after our beverages were served, and waited another five minutes after we decided what to order and put our menus down on the bar and away from us. Our food was served by a waitress about 7 minutes after we placed our order, though we had to wait a few minutes more for the bartender to cease filling drink orders, so we may ask him for napkins and dining utensils (specifically, a knife to cut our burgers in half).  The bartender disappeared as we were finishing our meal, so we had to distract a floor manager who was engaged in assigning staff to tables for the upcoming dinner hour to get our tab. He plopped it in front of us, and also disappeared.  We had to flag down a random waiter after we waited five minutes, to hand him our credit card and pay our bill.  This was our first visit to Red Robbin and it likely will be our last. While our burgers and fries tasted good (for $8.99 each they should), they still were not worth the hassle that we encountered. We can get a burger on par with Red Robin's elsewhere, be treated as if our presence matters, and as though our business is appreciated.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-gurnee?start=60,2.536,2.536,2.536,2.536,2.536

It took 25 minutes to get the order out, and they were just about raw. Finally, our waitress came back to ""see how the food was tasting"". By that time, we got a reorder to go. The manager got involved, apologized profusely, and took two of the three burgers off our bill and gave us a nice gift card. This has happened to us several times here, maybe its just us? The endless fries were nice, but never got more, so for us they were not so endless. One refill on the water (is it that hard to check back on your table a time or two???)

64,Jenifer W.,"Grayslake, IL",7,121,,1.0,2013-04-02,"Let me start by saying I loves me a burger, and Red Robin does great burgers. The reason the rating is so poor is two-fold - (a) the calories, and (b) the service. Read on, oh-those-of-you-4-star-posters... your thighs hates you. ATMOSPHERE: Lively. The restaurant features crazy American Kitzch, and has posters, bikes / mini airplanes and what not hanging from the ceilings, and an open floor plan which love it or hate it allows you to see and hear the entire dining room. FOOD: The burgers, fries, and most other dishes are really good. I can't say a word about the flavor, because it's delicious. What causes them to get ONE star only is the CALORIES in each and every burger you are consuming. Check their web page to verify (you have to really dig to find nutritional info - it's on the ""FAQ"" page), and read below to find out what you're eating: Gourmet Cheeseburger (ordered as-is) with fries - 1,250 calories and 1,750 grams of sodium A1 Peppercorn Burger (ordered as-is) with fries - 1,937 calories and 2,581 grams of sodium Whisky River SALAD (ordered as-is) - 1,799 calories and 2,385 grams of sodium These are examples - any ""specialty"" burgers or salads ramp up calories and heart stopping sodium contents by two, three, or even FOUR times the amount. COME ON PEOPLE!!!! Where I am not normally a freak about calories, I do like to be aware of what I'm eating, and when a restaurant so blatantly gorges its customers with unecessary and unhealthy choices, AND is so sneaky about hiding that fact, it p*sses me off.  Unless you want to blow up like a Macy's day parade balloon, indulge yourself elsewhere -this simply isn't worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-gurnee?start=60,2.5000000000000004,2.5000000000000004,2.5000000000000004,2.5000000000000004,2.5000000000000004

86,Steph U.,"Chicago, IL",817,473,264.0,1.0,2014-03-25,"Where do I even start with this place? Man. This was the most disappointing Red Robin experience I've ever had. When we first got here (there were 3 of us), they told us there was a 10 minute wait, which was fine with me. When we were seated the waitress didn't bring us water, we each had to individually ask for water. When we ordered, it took over 45 minutes to get our food. 35 minutes in, the waitress brought us a small batch of fries, ""because their kitchen was backed up"". It was a nice gesture, but couldn't she have done that like 25 minutes ago?? When our food finally came, it was...different than my past Red Robin experiences. I had already noticed that they changed their menu to make it incredibly complicated and hard to find items, but the food itself was different too. Instead of the normal plastic baskets, they came on red long plates that took up extra space, and my fries....what the heck?! There were about 10 fries in a tiny little metal cup. Okay, I get it. You're trying to up your ""fanciness"", but come on. You are RED ROBIN. No one's coming here for a fine dining experience. Not only were there barely any fries, they weren't garlic fries like I had ordered, so the waitress had to take them back, which meant once again, more waiting. Also, my boyfriend's fries didn't even come on his plate, which was so weird. Why did you bring out the plate if it wasn't ready? My burger was alright, I got the Shroom Burger. My boyfriend wanted the guacamole burger....but they ran out of guac. UHM. What?! She offered to put avocados on the burger instead, so he said alright, but it was pretty whack. My other friend got the Red Robin Tavern cheeseburger. His was the only order that stil came in the regular plastic basket and had everything that was supposed to be there. Anyway, when the server came back, I asked for a straw, and guess what? It never came. We were celebrating my boyfriend's early birthday (it was the next day), so my friend secretly told our server it was his birthday. While I was still eating my food and waiting for her to come back to order more fries, she all of a sudden shows up with this goopy, dripping, gross looking dessert. She then apologizes saying that they were out of ice cream, so they gave him soft serve. This was definitely not SOFT serve, it was MELTED serve! and it got EVERYWHERE. I wanted to try some, but I hadn't finished my meal, so by the time I was actually done, it was even more melted and more gross. The three servers (one being our server) that came over to sing the birthday song were so depressing. Our server was the only one who seemed like she cared and was genuinely happy. Another girl didn't even sing and had a frown on her face the entire time. The last girl sang, but looked like she hated everything. Overall, this was by far the worst experience I have ever had at a Red Robin and I'm upset with the direction in which they are choosing to take their food. I don't think I'll be back anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-gurnee?start=80,3.32,3.32,3.32,2.244,3.3200000000000003

Not sure if she was done her shift for the night but she didn't remove any of our dishes and took our tip, which she was lucky to get a decent one, before we even left the table.

Our plates sat there empty for well over 20 minutes. Two managers walked by, looked at our empty plates and had no concern. Never asked how everything was. This restaurant needs serious help. If red robin is spending all this money to update it they need to hire the right people to make sure they make their money back. Even better was listening to the bartender complain and 4 people getting yelled at in the kitchen. This was truly a horrible dining experience. We get one night to go out a week and this really left a horrible taste in our mouth. Service is key in a ""SERVICE"" related industry. We won't be retuning with plenty of other options in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-gurnee?start=80,2.96,2.96,2.96,2.052,2.96

When we walked in we were not greeted, but was asked how many people. The lady who was going to seat us asked if we wanted a booth or just a table, we asked for a booth and she tried seating us in a very small booth. We asked for another one and asked if we can go on the other side of the restaurant where there was a lot of space, apparently they cleared out that area and no one is allowed to go there. So half of the restaurant is empty with a lot of space and so we just decided to sit at a table. We sat down and waited for her to give us menus. She came back with other people to sit them down at a table and gave them menus and totally forgets about us. We had to ask her for menus and she apparently didn't understand us and had some attitude look on her. When she came back with the menus she just gives it to us without apologizing or anything.  The reason why I chose to give two stars is because our server deserved that star. He did a good job in taking care of us and checked on us to see if we needed anything.

Red Robin completed a renovation that transformed this restaurant (both in appearance and service). I'm not sure if they brought in new management but they quickly went from earning the hard-to-earn five star review to earning a measly two stars. Each time we are here, the service is so bad, I wanted to go into the kitchen and make the food myself. Not only is the service slow but it seems as though they don't want to wash their dishes. When you are done eating, you mine as well push the dishes off the table because they aren't going to take them from you. The food quality has dropped drastically. Every time I order a burger, I either receive the wrong food item or it isn't cooked properly (usually burnt to a crisp). The ""bottomless"" fries is practically the only thing that's good about this place but you are forced to ask for more, they do not ask you or offer them to you. They need new management and new employees. Corporate needs to re-evaluate this location because it has gotten way out of control.

I ordered the Whisky BBQ Burger (med-rare) with added Bacon. It was pretty good solid burger. No complaints here. The fries were decent too, although I'd prefer waffle or crispier fries over the steak fries. They have season salt at the table to put on the fries if you'd like.  My mom got the plain and simple burger with sweet potato fries, which she enjoyed and then got a box home.

Sorry, but this is how people in prison eat. As always, the service was extremely slow; it took more than ten minutes to get two glasses of water, and another fifteen or so before the order was taken. I ordered the whiskey burger, and it wasn't bad, but it and the fries were barely above room temperature. This is another constant at Red Robin, nearly-cold food.  Twenty minutes or so after we finished, we started looking around for someone to give us the check. Two people who had sat down next to us ten minutes earlier got up and left, absent even menus.

60,D D.,"Lake Villa, IL",177,10,,1.0,2015-04-07,"ONE STAR CANT GET LOW ENOUGH This review is more about what has happened to Red Robin, than my experience today, but today was the last straw.  I found myself on a lunch date with someone I had never met before, a new friend, and had  by far, the most unbelievably annoying, pushy, over-the-top flamboyant waiter I have experienced since my days of eating at a downtown trendy fern bar next to the Actors Studio.  Holy $&% was this guy ridiculous.  I won't shy from the ethnic or gay stereotype suggestions because he was a walking talking caricature of both.   Nothing but non-stop loud chatter in his fey ethnic / southern / Clark Street overdramatically happy pretentiousness, leaning in past what I would consider the personal space barrier, touching both our persons, then squatting down to breathe and spit on our silverware placed on a platter directly below his yapping mouth.  I literally saw some spray come from his yawning food shoot several times and was lucky enough not to feel it on my face.  I think THAT would have gotten me into a mode that would have ruined my date.   If that wasn't bad enough, he got THE ENTIRE ORDER WRONG.  Every item was wrong.  He was extremely nice, nothing negative about his behavior other than extremely overbearing, but he was pushy and almost authoritative, like being straight, going to La Cage Au Faux and being forced on stage with the cross dressers to be cowed into a chorus line.  It went on and on.  He kept coming back, apologizing for getting things wrong, then in a funny 'ha ha' way, twisted our arms to say something fake 'nice' about the service to the manager.   At one point after I had mentioned that I did not care for the specially salted French fries and my date complained about her salad, a rotund sweaty guy whose job it was to make nice with the complainers and give out free food cards, came over and squatted in the same way, yet another intrusion into our meal, meaty face and mouth, inches away from our food.  He apologized and asked us ""What he could do to make it right"" while Mr. shiny pants literally stood there right next to me, grandiosely clearing his throat like he was in a play, until we said something nice about the 'service.'  YES, I am not making this up.  We were 'forced' to say ""Oh, but the service is excellent.""  We lied.  Grandiosly. If I had been alone, I would have told him when he first walked up with the ""Y'alls"" and etc to ""tone it down please"" and then I would have escalated to ""Get a manager over here"" if he was not able to reign it in.  But this man was full bore bore.  He was outrageous and got everything wrong...a feat in itself, when all you serve is burgers and salads.  He never even asked for my level of doneness for my burger, nor the egg, which was runny and I did not want it that way, walking away after not only telling ME what I should have, but then also telling my new acquaintance, who then got what HE WANTED in a salad.   He literally talked over her as she was ordering and told her how ""yummy this or that was"" then brought her literally what he had suggested.  She complained kindly and that was his queue to go into apology mode, which was worse.  He tried to get her a new salad but she was in a hurry so could not wait (lunch break from work) for a new order, and then the show continued with the manager.  In all, about ten interruptions in all.  WOW.  Just wow.  What a freak show. He may be a great server and a really nice guy.  In fact, he seemed very nice.  But so over the top, so in-our-faces, that it was like he was on our date with us and was a third wheel we both were wishing was not with us.  I never even finished my burger.  I was too busy talking to him or the manager.  It was all about him.  All about our server and his need to be helpful.  He and the manager never even got that they would be ruining our meals by not leaving us the #^@! alone for a minute.  He brought the wrong fries, added the same wrong fries onto my plate, then after I kindly complained he brought out regular fries but left the ones on my plate.  He even knew about my dislike of all that salt and said that he accidentally placed the order for those fries on my plate, then fixed it NOT by taking them off my plate before they got to the table, but just bringing me regular fries.  And those were sub-par.  Dried out, overly salted, and over cooked.  It was like when Reni Santoni went yelling after Steve Martin's character in Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid ""It's all right. It's just a bullet. My wife Carmelita will suck it out. Go ahead. And don't worry about your pajamas. I'll take care of them!""  It was comical.  HE was comical.

I always order the same thing and the service is usually pretty good. Not amazing, but definitely above average. I have been to this location 3 times since recently moving here and have had issues every single time. Not only do they serve my meal wrong every time, but the server is typically absent most of the time.  The first time, we had to wait a very long time for the food and also the beverages. My husband ordered a beer and we eventually had to go to the bar to order it because it never came.  The second time, we had a server who was clearly new which is usually fine except that this time the food took so long coming out and she didn't update us at all until we had to stop her as she walked by to inquire about it. Our food finally came out, but not at the same time... All four of us got our meal at different times, and it was 15 minutes between the first one that came out and the last. The manager apologized to us (we didn't complain too much to her though, we're really not those kinds of people) and also got us a beer because it took so long for it to get to us.  The third time, I got a side of mac and cheese that literally made me feel sick. I didn't realize that that's what was making my stomach turn until my husband asked why I wasn't eating the rest of my food. I told him to try the mac and cheese and he was disgusted, he said you could taste that it had been in the fridge too long. I felt sick the rest of the night.

The waiter was new, his name is Marc-Anthony. He made excuse after excuse the entire time. My husband didn't receive his food until after our group had already finished theirs. Marcs excuse was that the kitchen was backed up. Clearly he had just forgotten to put our order in, and instead of fessing up to it, he blamed it on the kitchen. When he finally remembered he'd forgotten an order, he tried to remember what we ordered instead of asking us, so when he served the food, the order was wrong. Not to mention we paid an upcharge for bottomless sweet potato fries and we only received one order after asking over and over again for another order. We were out celebrating my son's birthday and we ordered ice cream, by the time it was served to us, it was melted! How long was it sitting out before it was served to us? We also weren't given any napkins at a table full of kids! The waiter, Marc, also never gave us refills on our drinks. This is a major problem on behalf of the managers, because this guy clearly was not ready to be on the floor, as this is a training issue. The waiter is also responsible, because the first rule of thumb for anyone in customer service, is never make excuses or blame other people. Always take accountability, it's more respectable and customers are easier to understand. This was a special occasion for my young son, and this waiter made it a terrible experience.

9,George G.,"Grayslake, IL",0,17,1.0,2.0,2017-10-12,"We have gone to Red Robin quite a few times over the last bunch of years.  Sad to say it appears their quality is slipping - at least at the Gurnee location... Issue 1:  on a not so busy night seated a table with an older child and two older adults next to two different large groups of small screaming kids.  Really?  You couldn't seat us on the other side of the room where the rest of the adults were? Issue 2:  service (or more accurately) lack of it...  our server was sure jumping and serving one table next to us, but did not even bother to check on us.  I tried several times to get his attention to no avail...  perhaps all the screaming kids drowned out my voice? Maybe so - but I can't imagine they impeded his vision...  felt like he did not see what he did not want to see. Issue 3: listening is a skill?  When you ask questions about something you're ordering you've never had before, it is very helpful you understand what's being asked to ensure you answer the question.  The menu was so full of choices I was trying to understand the differences - and thought I had after talking to the server.  Nope - the sandwich was not what I expected to get...  whose fault?  Should I have more carefully read the menu?  Or should the server been more descriptive about what I was ordering?  Most other restaurants I go to take the time to educate me - apparently not at Red Robin... Issue 4:  should I pay more for the extra bits of food and other nasty ""gunk"" that's left on the silverware?  Red Robin is not cheap ~ maybe that's why?  Could they have paid the dishwasher a couple extra dollars to do a better job? Issue 5:  we love our ""guests""...  they say so, but I'm not sure I feel the love...  from the manager to corporate guest services, I'm not very confident they see the way things are from my perspective.  ""We're sorry, we'll fix it, come back soon!"" doesn't really feel very sincere...   There's too many good dining choices in the area to run a restaurant like this.  I hope Red Robin listens to their customers (there some great feedback in these reviews)- I'd really hate to see them go because they were unwilling to believe they need to make improvements.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-gurnee,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
2,April J.,"Grayslake, IL",148,2,2.0,2.0,2017-10-20,"I've been to this location before and haven't had an issue but last night was an exception. My daughter had a coupon for a free birthday burger of her choosing. She ordered one on a gf bun, with sweet potato fries and I had a simple chicken sandwich, since I was just along to be transpiration.... When the check came, my $8.99 sandwich has been comped and her burger was left on the bill for $13.48 plus tax. The server stated that she couldn't control what comes off the bill. The manager was called over and he stated the same thing and when I told him that I wasn't going to accept that, he said that he'd give me $3 is cash if it's a really big deal. Yes. This is a big deal. Is this the actual policy? If so, please change the wording on the coupon that is sent out, specifically naming the birthday person, stating that their burger will be free. There is quite a disconnect here. Not cool Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-gurnee,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6
6,Judy L.,"Deerfield, IL",0,42,,4.0,2017-11-12,"Good food and good service at this location. We abandoned the Lincolnshire location due to poor service. Sad they discontinued the boca burger but now have a bean burger that is ok. Please offer more vegan options here in the future! This location is always busy and there may be a wait so go early. We will drive the extra 20 minutes for better service!

1,Lilianne T.,"Chicago, IL",720,96,257.0,3.0,2017-11-30,"My review may be a little biased because I was here on Black Friday - just a heads up. My friend and I came to have lunch here around 12ish. We were in seated in the bar area, which we were totally okay with. I've been to Red Robin before and I'm usually a huge fan of the burgers and fries. It did not disappoint as per usual - I got the guacamole bacon burger! I also asked for our fries before receiving the burgers to snack on. We also ordered an onion ring tower. We were a little too ambitious.. we didn't think 3 onion rings would be enough for each of us if we ordered the small tower, but we could not finish the large one at all! The onion rings are made so perfectly here - I just have to cut them in half, otherwise I end up having to put the whole thing in my mouth. Aside from the food, the customer service was rather slow. I wouldn't even say that it was really busy... I just didn't feel like we got checked on enough. We waited for quite some time when we were done eating our food to be able to get to-go boxes and pay for our meal. Overall, it was an okay experience at this location. Parking is spacious!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-gurnee,2.76,2.68,2.68,,2.712

Each of the five at the table all order a different type of burger and the burgers were amazing!!  The server was very friendly and helpful and we came in the store 15 minutes before the store closed- you would expect the staff to be a bit put out that we rolled in so late but they were not!!!!
