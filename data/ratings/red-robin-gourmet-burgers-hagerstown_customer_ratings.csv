The food is always over seasoned or improperly prepared.  I ordered and requested one of the toppings to be left off because of a slight allergy, it was brought out wih the topping.  I sent it back, it came back again with much less of the topping...they were busy so I dealt with it and popped a Benadryl.  Another visit, we ordered a specialty burger, it was like someone dumped black pepper on it.  That same visit, I sent the fries back for having a thick coat of season salt...it was as if they were double rolled in the salt.   At one recent visit, on a relatively busy night, the staff that wasn't sitting around gossiping and being chatty was busy complaining about customer messes and talking about their tip earnings, loudly.  My husband made a request for something at the end of our meal and our server rolled their eyes at him.   I've spoken to the manager about issues and empathized with the restaurant being busy and only received a handful of excuses. In short, the service is slow and when you do receive your food it'll probably be prepared wrong.  The staff is rude and not very attentive.   I made one last attempt at giving this place a shot.  I ordered a house salad.  The lettuce was browning and it was too busy for me to even think about requesting another (that and I don't trust a reserved meal).  2 hours later at home, I was sick as a dog.  Never eating at any RR location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hagerstown?start=20,1.988,1.988,1.988,1.988,1.988

When the server returned to see if everything was okay, we let her know we were not satisfied. She was apologetic and had the manager come over. His solution was to bring us a free cup of mandarin oranges (Thanks, but we already managed to drain the ones we had with a fork) and take $3.19 off our bill. Seriously?!

9,Chris B.,"Red Hook, NY",7,825,459.0,4.0,2016-07-06,"Umm - yummy! I was just in here the other day and ate a grilled chicken sandwich with bottomless fries (with a few other people present in my family along with me with other things), and although my only problem was the sandwich itself, the order was right. At one point, we did think that the electronic machine listing our order and bill wasn't listing special requirements for the order, but that was fine only a few moments later.  The employees here were friendly, though they were also getting quite busy inside. As for others and the ordering process, for the one, when my brother said to the employee to pick one because it didn't matter to him, she picked the spiciest burger between the two - little did she realize that heart problems runs in our family and spicy isn't always the best choice for us, but nothing major did happen on this trip there. The only thing I didn't really like is the placement of this Red Robbin inside this mall. It's kind of squished into the one corner of the mall, out of the way that makes it hard to get to from inside the mall. It does seem excellent that they had another door leading from outside, but that too posed a few problems from those who entered from the mall side and didn't realize that the entry line is near this outside door away from the mall side's entry door.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hagerstown,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24

She the said it would be 15-20 for a table. I asked if we could sit at the bar but she repeated it was 15-20 with a really BAD attitude they only had one server on a Sunday dinner night..

Had asked for more fries....they never came.   We asked another waitress if they were short staffed and she said yes.  The next time she came through she was walking slowly  and texting at the same time.  Another employee preceded to carry on a 15 min conversation with a patron.  At this point after I was finished with my cheeseburger the appetizer came. Still no fries or refills.  The bartender never stopped moving and could of used the services of the 2 waitresses in the bar area.  To top things off the women's restroom was filthy, no TP and the trash can was over flowing. No apology from anyone with the exception of the 3rd employee that brought out the appetizer and said it was free.  I gave Red Robin 1 star because the burger was actually pretty good. I did not contact the general manager because I was afraid she was going to give me free food on my next visit....let me just tell you there won't be a next time.  Red Robin.......not so yum!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hagerstown,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28

This was by far the worst excuse for a burger place that uses gourmet and friendly in it menu. I ordered the burger as pink as they would be able to do, so I went with that, It came so over done and under size I had to say somthing to the waitress, to point that out the mixup, I'm sure she's heard that many times before she was somewhat defensive and confrontational over what I pointed out to her. I so wish I had a scale they claim 1/2 lb burger I must say the bun dwarfed the burger.
