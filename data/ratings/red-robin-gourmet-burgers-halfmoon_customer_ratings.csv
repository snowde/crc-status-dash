Unlimited steak fries makes my wife super happy. Service is usually pretty good, and the food is rarely bad. Great for kids and families.

26,Robbie M.,"Raymore, MO",3,116,35.0,4.0,2013-02-18,"Today was my second time patronizing a Red Robin. The first time was for Veterans Day where all veterans got free Tavern Double cheeseburgers. I couldn't complain whatsoever since the burger was cooked as ordered (medium), and it's hard to say no to bottomless steak fries. That time the service was good, and I had a good server. Unfortunately, I can't remember his name, but he's a red-headed single dad roughly around 30 years old and is overall a nice person. Today I visited RR because I had a coupon for a free burger of my choice since it's my birthday. This time I went with the bacon guacamole cheeseburger, which I thought was really delicious. On this visit my server/bartender was Megan (brunette with blue eyes, bit of a beer gut), and sadly she seemed very indifferent about customer service. It irked me a bit because there were only two people including myself sitting at the bar, and Megan didn't seem particularly adamant about checking on either of us. Overall, though, this is a nice place to get quality burgers. The prices are on par with other chain establishments, but the value comes from the endless fries. It's also nice that the restaurant is decorated like a 1950s diner, so it has a neat atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-halfmoon?start=20,2.768,2.768,2.768,2.768,2.768

A place where you can bring all your screaming kids, let loose and get cheap food. It's been awhile since I had been to Red Robin but they used to have this smoothie that was fantastic. I couldn't remember the name of it and didn't see it on the menu so I asked the waitress if they still had smoothies. She said ""Yea, they can probably make you a smoothie. I think they have strawberry or banana."" So based on that I assumed they no longer had the specialty smoothie I used to get. Later I come to find out they had a separate drink menu with the smoothies listed on it and they still had the one I was looking for. It was called the Hawaiian Heartthrob. Then I was really annoyed that she didn't mention it or at least point out where the smoothies were on the menu when I had specifically asked.   The food came out pretty quickly and was decent.

However now they are using some tasteless frozen patties and skimpy ingredients, pre cooked extra thin bacon.  Our service wasn't great, the waiter was slamming things around and didn't seem to care when we sent the food back. Honestly the guy was tossing things around and literally threw straws at us from a decent distance, wet straws. Overall the food was not as good as it used to be, it was very cold and that didn't improve after sending the burger back. The buns were pretty stale  too.

We ordered our drinks appetizers and entrees  at the same time , didn't think we would see her again. After 5 minutes the drink order showed up; wrong, had to wait  again. The appetizers and entrees came out together but my wife's dinner was wrong so we sent the entrees back while we ate the appetizers.  My son's sandwich was served in a plastic basket with a sheet of paper in it, we took the sandwich out and noticed the basket was dirty with food, thanks for the paper barrier. The entrees came out in a reasonable time, again wrong, my wife's salad had the wrong  dressing, but we gave up and just ate it.   We did not see the waitress again, I waited 10 minutes after we were done before I ventured out to find my waitress, we already have been here 2 hours. I would normally tip 15% if the waitress just showed up but this time I could not, gave her 12%. I don't fully blame the waitress, the manager should have been walking the floor so he/she could see if there are problemd. Maybe it's time for a management change.

We were seated at a small booth by the kitchen. Our waitress had come to our table and greeted us by saying ""we are out of silverware so I can't bring any to you now, but will as soon as I can"". We ordered our appetizer (pretzel bites) along with our entrées, but said we'd like them served separately. The waitress came back to the table to tell us that appetizers were backed up and may come out at the same time as our meal, but that she would have her manager comp it for the inconvenience. The appetizer came out and then our entrées under a minute after. As we were attempting to enjoy our meal, two staff members began fighting and the argument moved to the side of our table.

38,Roger K.,"Clifton Park, NY",127,583,2672.0,3.0,2015-12-13,"Our last visit was about a year ago, and similar circumstances dictated a return for dinner.  When we arrived about 5:30 on a Saturday we were told it would be about a 20 to 25 minute wait.  Looking around, there were at least 20 people ahead of us.  But the hostess hit the nail on the head as our party of four was called at 5:55 to be seated. I was interested in trying something other than a burger since the handful of times I've had food at or from RR it's always been some type of burger.  I decided to review the menu online before we left the house.  I knew exactly what I wanted as we sat down.  But I couldn't find a combo of ribs and mac and cheese on the menu.  In fact, I couldn't find ribs anywhere.  Our server then let me know that they no longer sold ribs.  Obviously, I had looked at an outdated menu. So I decided to have the Buzz Clucks & Mac 'n' Cheese ($11.79) along with a pint of Shipyard Monkey Fist IPA ($5.29).  For the curious, Buzz Clucks are like breaded chicken fingers tossed in RR Buzz sauce.  The chicken was nice and moist and the breading was crispy, but that Buzz sauce, while being spicy, seemed to also be sour tasting.  My wife said the sauce tasted like Tabasco Sauce but don't recall the last time I put Tabasco on anything so I couldn't necessarily agree with her.  The Mac & Cheese is billed as made with four cheeses.  I found it very bland.  Maybe it was four different brands of American cheese.  It's saving point was the nice crispy top. My wife ordered the Arctic Cod Fish & Chips ($12.99) and a Soda ($2.79).  The cod was light and moist with a nice crispy coating.  The fries were nothing exciting, and I suppose that's why they offer a bottomless serving of them. Our dining companions said they were pleased with their choices of a Bacon Cheese Burger, well done, ($10.29) with Onion Rings ($1.49), Teriyaki Chicken Burger ($9.99) with Garlic Herbed Fries ($.99), Poppin' Purple Lemonade ($4.49), and Raspberry Cream Soda ($3.79). This trip was also our introduction to the wireless menu device on each table.  It can be used for viewing the menu, calling the server, playing trivia games, and paying your bill with a credit/debit card.  I was somewhat impressed with the payment portion.  It seems to know what table you are at since it brings up a listing of everything you ordered.  I wonder if the device was swapped with another table if it would get confused.  We decided to tryout the device with our credit card.  When it got to the Tip portion of the process, it calculates 20% on a slider bar.  You can move the slider in either direction to increase or diminish the tip.  It then even prints out your receipt.  Pretty cool. However, it was only while I was writing this review and looking at the receipt that I realize that we were charged an Entertainment Fee of $1.99.  I have to assume that was for the trivia games we were checking out.  When (if?) we return I think I'll go back to ordering a burger.  After all, there seems to be over 30 to choose from.  It the option existed, I would give 2.5 stars for a non-burger meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-halfmoon,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96
21,Morgan B.,"Norfolk, VA",0,4,6.0,1.0,2016-01-15,"Just had lunch at Red Robin and am pretty disappointed. I ordered the ghost chili burger because I like spicy food. The burger that came out was not spicy at all, it tasted like a regular cheeseburger. Then when the bill came I was charged for the nacho burger. I asked the waitress what I actually ate because it looked and tasted like neither of those. Her reply, ""Well you should've gotten what you ordered."" with plenty of attitude. I know what I should've gotten, this isn't my first trip to a restaurant I know how it works, what was I actually served? Maybe if you work at a restaurant that already has an automated ordering system in place the human servers should put out a little bit more effort before they're completely replaced by tablets. Then I find out that I was charged a $1.99 ""entertainment fee"" for the kids to play games on the table top tablet. Talk about cheap. you can buy all those apps for that. So basically my lunch consisted of getting the wrong food, being charged for something I didn't eat, not knowing what I was served and being nickel and dimed.

I'd enjoy a less conventional beer list. The french fries are industrial.

37,Sevann H.,"Springfield, IL",262,549,1938.0,2.0,2016-08-06,"It's a chain restaurant, though there are great food chains out there so I'm not sure that's an excuse for mediocrity. We ordered the Southern charm burger, which wasn't as charming as it sounds. It was heavy, the bread was soggy, and lacked a lot of flavor. I ordered a salad which didn't taste fresh. It tasted processed and left much to be desired. Service was spotty, they weren't that busy yet our interactions with the staff were sparse. Makes it hard for this place to compete with some of the burger joints in town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-halfmoon,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88
36,Nancy S.,"Cohoes, NY",188,183,79.0,2.0,2016-08-11,"Pretty disappointed with our most recent visit to a typically reliable chain restaurant. Opted to sit at a booth in the bar area, and ended up having the bar tender as our server. Her personality was probably the only redeeming quality of our visit. Ordered an appetizer, which usually doesn't take long to arrive at the table, but when it had been 10-15 minutes, we knew something was up. Our entree orders ended up coming out, and we had to ask for the appetizer we ordered (was brought to the table by someone other than our server). I ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich, which came out as just a crispy chicken sandwich with the buffalo sauce in a container on the side, not a huge deal, just annoying. So, I asked to have it be tossed in the sauce. Husband ordered chicken tenders which were pretty standard. Waited a while for drink refills, as well as refills on fries. In general, the service was almost nonexistent. I'm not sure why they would schedule a bartender to be working the bar, multiple dinner tables in the bar area, as well as taking care of to go orders. I can't really fault her - although she was clearly overwhelmed, she remained positive. Just wish we didn't have to suffer the consequences of Red Robin's illogical staffing choices. I understand a chain restaurant isn't going to deliver a 5 star experience, but I've experienced better at some others.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-halfmoon,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8

42,Carol B.,"Watervliet, NY",56,13,,2.0,2016-12-18,"I keep holding off writing, hoping to like this place again.  It's a chain, and the food is pretty mediocre, not horrible, but not gourmet-quality, either, for the price.  Not much flavor, and too much bun, but the fries are good.  My biggest complaint (and this is true of the Latham location, too) is that it is always filthy.  We sat in the bar area at the hightops, several of which weren't bussed or wiped down for way too long.  The women's room is downright disgusting, again, this is more than once.  Unflushed toilets, trash all over the floor (yes, even a tampon once).  The waitress was friendly, although maybe one should tell her that calling people ""honey"" and ""sweetheart"" in every sentence gets annoying quickly.  This was probably the last chance I've given, because as much as I want to have that first experience again, which was good, it's clearly not going to happen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-halfmoon,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6
35,Steve E.,"Tampa, FL",201,1582,5020.0,4.0,2016-12-22,"I don't generally frequent chain restaurants, but when traveling late at night, and while out of state, I'll gladly stop anywhere that is still serving food. My flight to Albany had been delayed, and I was powerfully hangry, so I pulled in to get something to eat before driving to my sister's house. That's what brought me to the relatively new Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Restaurant, located in the Halfmoon Crossing shopping center along Rte. 9 in Clifton, Park, NY. The Red Robin chain started in Seattle back in 1969, and they continue to open restaurants all over the country. They're best known for their gourmet burgers, unlimited baskets of fries, and fast, friendly service. I sat in the bar area so that I could catch up on sports scores. Bella was both the bartender and my waitress, and she was extremely pleasant. In between sips of my frosty cold Adult beverage, I cheered as I saw the Bucs had won, and placed an order for a burger and side salad. The salad was a grilled Caesar salad, and that turned out to be halved Romaine lettuce heads, grilled, and then drizzled with Caesar dressing and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese. Certainly a different presentation, but darned tasty. The star of the show was my A-1 Peppercorn burger which was a nice burger patty, topped with hardwood-smoked bacon, melted Pepper-Jack, A-1 Peppercorn Spread, tomatoes and crispy onion straws on an onion bun. I added onion rings for my side. And in the immortal words of the Red Robin TV commercials.......YUMMMMMMMM!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-halfmoon,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68

The cleanliness of the bathroom is what lost them a star. Anyways, we went when it was not very busy, and had a very pleasant experience. The waiter was patient, kind, and very attentive without suffocation. The ghost burger was great and just as spicy as you would think! The burger with the mac and cheese was also pretty tasty!

34,Steve N.,"Albany, NY",164,381,697.0,1.0,2017-03-04,"I'm of the mind that Red Robin is the worst burger chain in America.  I was curious to try their new 'tavern' burgers to see if they are any better than the insipid, chewy hockey pucks their standard burgers are made with. The tavern burgers are made with two thin patties as opposed to a single thick patty. Nope, the tavern burgers suck too. The ""beef"" patties on a Red Robin tavern burger are tiny. The bun and toppings dwarf them, and you can't really taste them under all that stuff (I think that's intentional). The grind is odd, and it makes for a mealy, gummy, mouth feel. There is no char or caramelization on them, mine had only three thin grill marks on two gray disks that are so perfectly round, and so thin, you would mistake them for a beer coaster if someone plopped them on the table. They taste like a beer coaster too, there's no seasoning on them, and they have no beef flavor whatsoever.  What Red Robin sells are not burgers. They are selling topping, cheese, and sauce laden monstrosities on a bun, that just happen to have beef in them. Low quality, flavorless, mealy, beef.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-halfmoon,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
