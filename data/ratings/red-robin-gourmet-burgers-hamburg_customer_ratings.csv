42,gloria k.,"Shartlesville, PA",4,8,3.0,3.0,2012-01-08,"We have been at the Hamburg RR twice now, and I am giving them a 3-star rating based on the average of both visits. The food is always good. The service was fair to good during our first visit.  During today's visit, the service left a lot to be desired. We received a friendly greeting were seated, and our orders taken promptly.  We got our appetizer quickly and had enough time to enjoy it before our dinners arrived.  On the negative side, the waitress got my order wrong and then I was nearly done with the rest of my meal before she brought the right item. My husband asked for a second refill on his soda, which never came. And they left the emptied dishes sit on our small table rather than clearing them, even though we placed them in an obvious spot for removal. We enjoy RR's menu, and I'm hoping the Hamburg RR team improves their service.  :-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hamburg?start=40,3.2120000000000006,3.2120000000000006,3.2120000000000006,3.2120000000000006,3.212000000000001

48,Michele H.,"Gettysburg, PA",3,8,,1.0,2012-05-29,"Don't bother asking for a medium rare burger, they can't figure that out. I sent a cold over cooked burger back and in return I got a slightly warmer still overcooked burger.  Pray you don't get Mallory as a waitress, she is by far the worst waitress I have ever had and I have had a lot! I could barely hear her speak, and in a loud environment as RR always is that is not a good thing. We had to wait 20 minutes for our drinks. When she finally arrived with them she had drinks for FOUR tables on one tray. So people who sat down 10 minutes after I did got their drinks at the same time.  After that three tables (one of which was a Mallory table) who sat down after we did got their food before we did.  I asked to see a manager. Right after I complained about waiting 45 minutes and then receiving a cold overcooked burger and missing a salad, another table of Mallory's did the same thing. After this fiasco they did comp me the burger but with everything that happened I feel they should have comped my whole check!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hamburg?start=40,3.0120000000000005,3.0120000000000005,3.0120000000000005,3.0120000000000005,3.012000000000001

Needless to say, Red Robin does not exist in NYC and when we stopped in Hamburg, we picked this place because it was either McDonald's, Wendy's, Taco Bell, and Red Robin.  We were not disappointed. My boyfriend ordered the chicken salad something-something. It was huge and we figured out pretty quickly that it probably had more calories than my burger, but boy was it good! Comfort food in a salad! I ordered the original burger and asked for a SMALL side of fries. The side was small (exactly 10 steak fries) and asked for the onion strings in the burger. The whole thing was amazing, and I wanted to say yes when the waitress asked me if I wanted more fries, but I had to refuse.

56,J H.,"Borough of Princeton, NJ",0,97,,3.0,2012-12-18,Solid three stars. Second time here. First time abt a year ago. This time sat at the bar. Turkey burger. House salad. French fries. Some sort of hot apple pie wedges for dessert. Coke to drink. Great service. Good solid casual dining experience. 22$ before tip. My one observation: for $22 I prefer a real plate for my burger and fries (of which there were too few) rather than a plastic basket. Seemed a little too casual at that price point. Maybe ok for kids but not for an adult. Large holiday tip for the server who was pleasant and efficient at the same time. Good place for a meal after a quick trip in to the nearby monster Cabelas store.

7,Brandon E.,"Atlantic Highlands, NJ",256,458,169.0,2.0,2016-02-01,"I have definitely been to better Red Robins no doubt there. We walked in and not trying to be funny or cute but the whole place smelled like a big fart. Really what it smelled like was rotten eggs or sulfur. Not sure what it was but the smell lingered the entire time we ate. It was not great, but we were in a rush and didn't feel like getting up and leaving so that is my own fault for sitting in it. Service was meh at best. It was 2pm on a Thursday, needless to say it wasn't busy but it took quite awhile for our food and our drinks to ever get refilled. I think the little ipads that they have installed on tables has actually cut down on service across the board at Red Robin. Overall the food tastes the same as every other Red Robin in the country. But I wouldn't come back to this one as this area is usually a pit stop and I want to be in and out quick.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hamburg,3.48,3.48,3.48,,3.4800000000000004

I visited this location on Memorial Day after the Hamburg carnival.  The staff was friendly, even though it felt like some of them didn't want to be there. It being Memorial Day though, that was understandable. All the food was enjoyable and served in a timely manner. You can't go wrong with the onion ring tower and one of their juicy signature burgers!

8,Brian Z.,"Reading, PA",0,92,,4.0,2016-07-10,"4 stars for the food.  3.5 for the service. Not that the service was bad at all. BUT when a ""server"" (I.e. someone who is supposed to serve you) takes your order and then is NOT the person who ""serves"" your food, the tip is the bare minimum.  15% and before tax.  How can I give a great tip when there are two people vying for my tip and neither one is doing the entire job?  This other person delivers my food and then within one minute the original server comes by to ask me how everything is.  If she is that close behind the delivery person why didn't she just pick up my food, deliver it, and asked me how everything is?  I know, I know..  corporate would say they are trying to ensure that my food is delivered as fresh as possible, or some other BS cooked up by the millennial hipsters back at HQ.  Would another minute really matter?  You're serving hamburgers and fries, not soufflé. Don't worry, Red Robin..  this isn't just you.  All the chains do it and I treat them all the same. All that said, the burgers and fries are good. Bathrooms are clean but I am somewhat confused as to why there is a TV in the men's room.  Why not the women's room?  I suppose our NASCAR loving brethren can't miss a single minute.  Are you really going to stand there and pee and turn your neck hard left so as to not miss anything?  Are you going to sit in the stall and watch through the crack in the door?  When Jimmy Joe Bob finishes the race while you're in the head are you going to yell ""Yee Haw!"" In the rest room?  Is this a family restaurant or a sports bar?  Maybe those millenial hipsters back at HQ really have no idea. All in all a good place and I'll be back. Note to HQ;. ditch the ""server sharing"" so I can ensure that if my waitress (ooops I said ""waitress""..  how UN politically correct I am) does a good job and warrants a good tip that she will receive it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hamburg,3.44,3.44,3.44,,3.4400000000000004

We went at 4 pm on a Saturday and the place was crowded but we were able to be seated right away. The service was alright throughout the meal, although our waitress disappeared for long periods of time when we needed a drink refill. My boyfriend wanted to order the spinach artichoke dip but I was a little leery about this because the last time we ordered this (at the Collegeville location) we were given a tiny ramekin of 4 spoonfuls of dip and had to ask for more dip as we felt we were being cheated paying 7.99 for such a minuscule amount. Thankfully, this location served a much larger bowl of dip and we did not need to ask for more but unfortunately, the dip was lukewarm. Our burgers were delicious- I got the Wild West buffalo and my boyfriend got the Whiskey River BBQ. The fries were perfect. You must try the campfire sauce with your fries! Now for the ugly...the ladies bathroom was dirty and out of the three available stalls one was out of order on a Saturday night. Hopefully this was just a one-off. We would be back because the service and food was decent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hamburg,3.64,3.64,3.64,,3.6400000000000006

5,Norman L.,"Manchester Center, VT",0,9,,1.0,2017-04-17,A perfect example of a restaurant more concerned with image than providing good quality food for a fair price. The dining room was attractive and clean. The service though highly scripted was attentive.  The food was horrible. There is no excuse for poorly prepared burgers at a burger restaurant. My server asked how I would like my burger cooked... medium rare please was delivered as well done. My wife and ordered a veggie burger that was  described as grilled... it was a pasty partially raw inedible product. The fries were undercooked as well.  For us Red Robin became Dead Robin. As much attentions needs to be paid to the food as was paid to the concept... a good concept does not fill ones belly. The manager was very professional and responsive to the situation.

0,T W.,"Marlton, NJ",0,7,3.0,4.0,2017-07-19,"It looked like our waitress or the entire back-end of the restaurant was having a bad day. The service was slow and the staff appeared disorganized. The restaurant was at capacity and there was a wait for a table. Our appetizer order was forgotten and then finally delivered at the end of our meal. I ordered the Avo-Cobb-O salad which had large strips of chicken. No knives were delivered to the table. Either have the kitchen cut up the chicken into chunks or make sure you provide appropriate silverware for the meal. The server said she had to check to see if she could find a knife. Umm, we are at a sit-down restaurant right? I thought knives would be commonplace. I had to wait about 5 minutes for the knife. Only half the amount of straws were placed on the table for the amount of drinks we ordered. Waited so long for the straws that we just drank our beverages without them. The manager preemptively came to our table to apologize for the service.  Now for some positives! The food was very good and just about the same price as taking our family of 5 to smashburger or 5 guys.  My daughter loves any place that has a gluten free bun for her burger so we will definitely give Red Robin another chance.  Gradewise, I give them an A+ for gluten free food options, A for food quality and price, and a C for service on this particular day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hamburg,3.68,3.68,3.68,,3.6800000000000006

They also have a non Boca vegan burger with sweet potato fries which is a nice switch up. Eating a Boca burger in comparison to everyone else's burgers is such a tease! Yeah, I know the carnivores are laughing, ha ha. At least they are considerate of those with restrictive diets.  The service is consistent and friendly. They don't ignore you or forget your order.  So, if you're craving RR, this location is decent. What would make me give a higher rating is if they had a better beer selection.
