62,Dennis H.,"Middletown, PA",0,39,8.0,2.0,2012-05-05,"My family and I ate at Red Robin last night. This was our first time there since they changed the menu. The service was spectacular! Our server Ryan took very good care of us. His timing was spot on. The new menu, not so much :( I ordered onion rings as an appetizer, which were as usual; good. They use whole  onions which were naturally sweet and the batter dip them, served on a tower with two sauces. I like the campfire sauce. I ordered the Reds Tavern double with bacon and bacon aioli. It was reported to be big on bacon favor...well it had one piece of bacon, and I could not taste the aioli. The burger was done and was tasty, but being a bacon lover, this was not bacony. If you want good burgers, they are one of the best in the area, service is great, but I DO NOT LIKE THE NEW MENU. I will take some time to come back... Oh, one last thought: As we were entering, we noticed a dead bird on a bench outside, it must have hit the glass windows and ended up on the bench...it was a Robin...Dead Robin...Humm Bad omen? maybe?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-harrisburg?start=60,2.568,2.568,2.568,2.568,2.5680000000000005
61,Beth R.,"Dauphin, PA",0,9,,3.0,2012-11-25,"I've never been a big fan of Red Robin, but it's an ok place to stop if you're out and about and want a fairly quick casual meal.  Definitely not a place I'd make a special trip for. One thing I don't understand is why a place that is supposed to have ""legendary"" burgers can't have better rolls. Whenever I've gotten burgers there the rolls have been stale and so dry they crumble apart.  The burger I had today would have been good if not for the stale roll and the unfresh lettuce. That's the other thing- their shredded lettuce always tastes like old lettuce that was soaked in that chemical they use to refresh produce that's on the verge of 'going over' .  It's unfortunate really. An establishment that has the volume of burger sales that they do should have no problem pulling off fresh ingredients.

If you're hungry make sure you don't order the petite burger, it comes with 4 french fries and   as for the petite burger, I've  seen bigger burgers in a kids meal, as for my waitress, she spent way too much time sitting and talking to her friends which is the reason why our burgers were ice cold.

I told our waitress Kelsey about the burned bun and she wanted to know if he wanted a new bun, yeah right! by the time he would get a new bun his burger would be cold, No Thanks..

40,Kimberly A.,"Harrisburg, PA",61,9,,2.0,2013-06-20,"Came in here for a lunch break with a friend.  My main complaint about the restaurant is the new ""ziosk"" feature.  It's basically an iPad on the table where you order your drinks, requests for refills, order your appetizers, and pay on the Ziosk.  My friend and I haven't been there for some time, and when our server seated us, she quickly explained what the ziosk was and zoomed away.  We figured our server would come by and re explain the machine or at least get our drink order (since she only had one other table), but she didn't come by for a good 15 minutes until we had to flag her down.   When we ordered our drinks and apps, she just put them on the Ziosk and walked away.  A different server came out with our orders, and when we paid on the Ziosk after our meal it automatically suggested we tip 20%. 20%. Really? You want me to pay 20% on what basically was an experience I could have had from just going to Sonic? Needless to say, I readjusted the tip to what I saw fit and we both left unsatisfied.  The Ziosk would be convient...if you are not expecting to be served.  To be honest, what's the point of having servers?  The stupid thing was also taking up obnoxious amount of space on our small 2 person table. If they got rid of the Ziosk this review would have had a lot higher rating, but unfortunately that is not the case.

So the food is decent and filling. The service depends on time of day and how full the restaurant is.  On our most recent visit, they got hit with a large group, and in spite of it being late and not otherwise crowded, the service at our table suffered a bit.  But it happens.  I know from experience that large groups are difficult.

It wasn't all bad, at least.  Without really getting into a full fledged and detailed review,  I will just give it something simple as I really don't want to waste much time on this one.  The problem with this page isn't with the servers. They were great. they earned this page two stars.  The food didn't.  Honestly, I was a little shocked at the bill after the subpar food. The French Dip was nearly flavorless and the onions were soggy. The cole slaw was also nearly tasteless. My family all got burgers. They complain about the mediocre taste. The fries were standard steak fries. They were decent. But not overly impressive.  So when in the Colonial Park area and you are itching for a burger, maybe try 5 guys. Around $65 bill for two kids meals, two burgers, a French Dip, sodas and a beer. Oh, and really tasteless pretzel bites. That was before tip.

4,Christopher C.,"Conshohocken, PA",168,1318,6419.0,3.0,2014-07-19,"A place like RR truly defines a solid but never overwhelming three star experience. The kids meals are a decent value as the entrees are of a good size and they have a decent array of healthier sides with fruits & vegetables instead of most chain places that only offer fries or look at you like you're nuts if you ask about subbing out said fried items. The adult entrees were a Banzai Burger and a Turkey Burger.  The Turkey Burger was cooked alright but they added way too much of the spicy sauce to it so that each bite turned into a slop fest.  The lovely wife proclaimed her Banzai acceptable although it was almost a bit too pink for her tastes/what she asked for. The infamous bottomless fries now matter more than ever since RR started practicing portion control by putting your first round of fries in that stupid metal cup.  I suppose it's a great idea for their bottom line but it's annoying no doubt to the service staff/the paying customers when only eight fries show up with your burger so you know right away that you likely are going to be asking/waiting for more. As for the service, nothing extraordinary as it was after the lunch rush and even though our server had quite a few tables to look after she more or less kept up with clearing plates & drink refills. On a ranting sidebar, the Ziosk is still the most stupid & annoying thing to ever enter the world of chain dining.  We're not one of those modern mutant families that must be entertained/titillated at all times so  the rare times we visit a RR the first thing to get removed from the table and put either on the window sill or the floor is the Ziosk.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-harrisburg?start=20,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.668,2.48

So a place that says they have the best, specialize in it, and whose menu is filled with different kinds and options should be able to nail a good burger, right? Let's talk temperature. Any ""burger joint"" should have this down to a science. But I ordered a medium rare burger and it came out beyond well done. The bread was really soggy, the fixings not fresh at all, and I opted for the broccoli instead of fries and almost threw up when I ate one piece. It was that bad, and really overcooked. I didn't send it back because I at least try to be a really easy customer. I just wanted to pay, give my excellent server Ian a good tip, and get out of there. My fellow diners had similar terrible food, but I'll leave it to them to review it. The good thing, if there was one, was the bottomless drinks outside of fountain drinks.

I resorted to just drinking their water, which was disgusting because it was unfiltered and had a nasty taste. I thought most restaurants these days have industrial water filters, especially if the city water is nasty. If it was all super cheap I could probably forgive it. But for a comparable price you can get a great artisan burger cooked to perfection at any decent restaurant. Really a shame...and a ripoff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-harrisburg?start=20,2.8,2.8,2.8,2.504,2.8

I guess they're trying that burger and beer ""pub"" feel.  Not really working.  Its still a family restaurant to me.  They do have a great rewards program that's all digital now.  You simply put your phone number into the tablet on the table and it will calculate your transactions.  I've often been surprised with a free burger upon check out.  What I don't like are the fact that the prices went up.  Plus their alcohol prices are insane.  And not in a good way.  You could get a domestic draft and pay about $7.  Its a chain in PA why $7 for a miller lite?  Oh well.  Also the place is not always very clean which takes away from their burger bar feel and back down to the kid friendly family place.  The bathrooms are ALWAYS dirty.  Everytime my daughter tells me she has to go I cringe.  I've  never been to a place that has had a bathroom as consistently dirty as this Red Robin.   Anyway I'll return when I have a free burger or I am getting a craving for their fries.  But I am disappointed at the decline in cleanliness and consistency.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-harrisburg,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006

32,Harrison F.,"Waynesboro, PA",54,49,31.0,3.0,2017-03-17,"Red Robin's claim to fame is the wide variety of burger options plus bottomless steak fries but this restaurant fell short of the mark. The food was satisfactory and likely worthy of 4 stars; however, the poor service caused it to drop a star.  A group of 4 of us stopped in for a late lunch and after a short wait were taken to our table. Walking through the seating area is a little tricky. I understand the desire to pack as many tables as possible into the building but when there isn't room for me to slip past some of the larger customers it may be time to redesign the layout.  Our waitress quickly took our food and drink orders but then disappeared until bringing our meals. I asked for mustard but she forgot about me and didn't bring it until my last bite of burger.  The food is decent when it comes to burgers but in my opinion the menu needs simplified. Too many options and choices especially when they push the idea of ""build your own burger""... why even have such an option if every burger imaginable is already on the menu. The fries are great but don't buy into the idea of bottomless. The second serving is smaller and after being brought to the table the waitresses seem to disappear - mostly bc you use the kiosk on the table to pay your bill so they have no reason to come back around.  Food is worth coming back for again and hopefully service will be improved.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-harrisburg,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006

Once seated at our salty table (yes, salt and crumbs left from previous guests) I noticed 2 tables that were half booth, half table. I asked a passing waitress if we could have one of them she said yes.  We ate, our waiter was cool. Had to ask for our check. Paid on the table top thingy and left.

While leafing through my menu, there was some food on the pages and sticky spots, but I tried to ignore it. Having recently given up meat (who knows how long this will last...) I decided to get the Garden Burger and a side of ranch. I requested that we receive our fries ahead of our meal, as all locations typically accommodate. The fries took around 10-15 minutes to receive, sans sauce. Then, it took until my meal come to finally be able to get my sauce, as my server was nowhere to be found to request my dipping sauce for my fries. My meal, which by the way, I watched sit under a heat lamp for about 10 minutes before someone finally took notice and brought it to my table. When my burger arrived, my boyfriend's burger had items on it that he had requested not be on his burger, luckily I eat pickles, so I got those. However, my burger was practically falling apart. Luckily, it tasted delicious, but I may as well just ordered a burger salad, because this was not a handheld meal, but rather one that required extra effort to keep it all from falling out of the bun.

The jalapeño relish was almost nonexistent, perhaps they were trying to save money by putting only a teaspoon on?  The candied bacon was missing and when I asked our server she seemed irritated. She brought me regular bacon. I asked about the candied bacon and she said it doesn't come with candied bacon. I shouldn't have to inform the staff what ingredients come on the food they serve, but she did bring me candied bacon then. Overall, the burger was gross and certainly wasn't worth $14.

I get emails every week from Red Robin for their BOGO burger specials. I am away from home during the week so I decided to invite the friend that I am staying with to get dinner with me at Red Robin. 1. We order. Food comes out. Everything is fine. We ask for drink refills when our food is brought to the table. 2. The waitress sets my drink on the table, and then proceeds to spill my friend's large Coke all over him, all over his food, and all over his phone. We scramble to dry off his phone. 3 other staff members come over to help clean up the mess. We are moved to another table. The phone seems to be fine. However, my friend's dinner was ruined because the bun soaked up the coke. The staff tells us that he'll get another burger pronto. Everyone makes mistakes, so we are fine at this point. Coke-soaked and wet, but fine. 3. We wait another 15-20 minutes. Don't see the waitress, and then she finally comes over to the table and asks us if we need anything else. I ask when they are going to bring my friend's burger. She gets annoyed and asked why he would get another burger. I said, as nicely as possible, because the first burger was ruined. She storms off to the kitchen. This young lady just dumped a large coke all over my friend and now she has an attitude about the situation. 4. Manager brings over the burger after another 10-15 minutes. 5. Try to pay the bill, but since we were moved to another table there is no computer pay station at the new table. I don't see our waitress at this time so I get someone else to help. They bring a computer pay station to us. But there is no bill on the pay station. 6. I then click the CALL WAITRESS button. The waitress comes over and puts the bill on the pay station which takes about another 10 minutes. But it isn't at the special price, it's at full price. She says that she can't help us with that. At this point I am in disbelief and I lose it. I go and find a manager. I explain what has been going on, and the manager then tells me that the food is on the house because of the situation. What a mess. Red Robin, get it together? I know that working in food service is not a fun job.
