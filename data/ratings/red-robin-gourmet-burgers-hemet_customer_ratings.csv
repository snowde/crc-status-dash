UNFORTUNATELY my family will NOT be coming back to this particular one, unless it's happening to all the Red Robin's!! We went today for happy hour and to get the usual, bottomless fries and root beer floats. We walked in and wanted to be seated in the bar area. We were informed that nobody under the age of 21 isn't allowed. We ask since when and she couldn't give us a right answer. So we asked if we sit in the restaurant area if we could still get the happy hour service there. She said she'll have to see if a server can come and help us in that area. Really?? Well, Brett didn't like that answer and we left. I wish that I stepped up and asked another manager besides her. That stinks! I really hope that other Red Robin's aren't doing this because they'll lose a lot of service! I will be calling and getting some answers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hemet?start=100,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006
73,Dakota G.,"Anaheim, CA",11,66,68.0,4.0,2012-05-02,"I LOVE RED ROBIN! Simple as that. I don't know how I went so long without eating here! I guess every time I suggested going to Red Robin, nobody seemed to like the idea. Not one person I know said anything except ""I heard they are expensive!"". Seriously, this comment was all I heard about it. Well I know now to not listen to anyone unless they have actually been to the place. Anyway, moving on. Red Robin is a really great burger restaurant with a great atmosphere and friendly service. They have more food than just burgers. So far I have tried their bacon avocado burger,  the 'seafood scatter', (which is a platter of seafood :golden brown cod, fried shrimp and clam strips: with fries and cole slaw), and the Three For All appetizer. The seafood was perfect! It tasted amazing and the portion was huge! I had the 'Hawaiian Heart Throb' smoothie (strawberries, banana, coconut cream and pineapple juice) and it was delicious! No matter what I get, I always substitute the regular fries with the sweet potato fries. They are so yummy! The burgers are huge and they all kinds of different tastes to pick from.  I plan to be a regular at this joint! Update: I love the ""Three For All"".  The Bacon Aioli is AMAZING!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hemet?start=60,2.9600000000000004,2.9600000000000004,2.9600000000000004,2.9600000000000004,2.9600000000000004
114,Stacy M.,Inland Empire,0,46,,2.0,2012-05-03,"First off, to reviewer who was complaining about people under 21 not being able to be in the bar area, that's just state law. No way to change that and furthermore, for those of us that are BEYOND sick and tired off hearing bratty kids and crying babies, the bar areas are a reprieve from people with snotty, ill-behaved children. It used to be when I was a kid (which wasn't that long ago) kids were taught to have manners in eating establishments, not anymore. I was taken outside if I ever cried or screamed or intruded on someones peace, but not anymore. Bars are the only place to get away from indulgent oblivious parents with their bratty children so thank goodness for Red Robin enforcing state law. Anyway, on to my review of this actual Red Robin. Out of all the Red Robins I have been to, this one by far has the worst service. Service was terrible (and the place was slow) and our food was cold and delivered at different times.

98,L W.,"San Jacinto, CA",1,8,7.0,2.0,2012-06-22,The two star rating is for the new policy that closed off 1/2 of the restaurant.  Don't me wrong...Red Robin is a safe bet for good food at a fair price but if you have to wait longer to be seated then it isn't worth it. What have they changed?  The bar area with additional seating is no longer available for family dining (as per the hostess the evening we went).  This decision by Red Robin has decreased the available seating to about half.  So now if you want to go there with anyone under 21 you will have a long wait for a table.   We probably will not be going back to Red Robin :-(.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hemet?start=80,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003

135,Jack B.,,2,10,,4.0,2012-10-05,"My wife ate at the Red Robin in Hemet, CA a couple of weeks ago.  It was mid-afternoon (too late for lunch and too early for dinner) so it wasn't very busy when we arrived.  We were warmly greeted when we entered the restaurant the hostess and promptly seated at a nearby booth. The server was busy finishing up with another customer so after only about a minute, the manager came by and explained that the server would be right with us and took my wife's drink order (Very Berry Raspberry Limeade) while he was there (I wasn't ready to order yet). The server made it to our table about a minute later.  She was friendly and took my drink order (Freckled Lemonade) while we continued to look over the menu.  When the server brought my drink, we place our food order.  I ordered the Red Robin Gourmet Cheeseburger and my wife ordered the Prime Rib Dip.  They delivered the food to our table in about 5 minutes and it looked very good.  My burger had good flavor and ample toppings.  The fries were crisp with plenty of potato flavor.  My wife thought her sandwich tasted good but that there was too much bread, so took the top off, and ate it open-face style.  It tried my wife's drink thought that both her drink and mine were weak.  The strawberries in mine were soft and mushy like they had been frozen and thawed.  They weren't very appealing and had very little flavor.   We'll probably stick with cokes or iced teas next time. Overall, the service was very good (although my wife thought it was a little intrusive), the food was very good but the drinks could have been better.  We'll probably return when were in town again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hemet?start=100,3.088,3.088,3.088,3.088,3.088

They're strawberry lemonade is by far one of the best I've ever had! I usually get the arnold palmer with strawberry lemonade. The bitterness from the ice tea compliments the sweetness of the strawberry lemonade to make my perfect drink. (I don't drink overly sweet stuff) They also have a BBQ burger with onion strings that is off the hook! They also have other lemonades and spritzers that are good, I usually sip the ones that my family gets because I could never drink a full glass of those.

The broccoli has always tasted fresh, and is mostly the floret portion (many restaurants serve broccoli that is mostly stem, not Red Robin - they serve the yummy floret with very little rubbery stalk interruptions). Red Robin's yummy steak fries are excellent (and deserving of all of the praise/hype) but I rarely enjoy them due to my dietary concerns.  Many options for buns and sauces.  Options, options, options!   Great menu, great value (the recent price increases were mostly 75 cents or less, and seem to have only affected the gourmet burger choices), and friendly staff.  1 star removed because even the friendliest waiters (at both the Hemet and Chula Vista locations) seem to avoid your table after your food has been delivered.  Perhaps to avoid having to provide for ""bottomless"" fries and broccoli?  not sure, but its a bit aggravating.

I tried to explain to her that we were planning to have lunch at her restaurant and her comment to me was ""Everyone says that"" so I stated to her that I would be more then happy to go in and purchase a gift card to show that my intention in being a patron after the parade was true, her comment to that was ""no, if she did it for me she would have to do it for everyone."" Now take this into account, the remaining business' around them (burger king, mimis, family dollar, fitness 19, pep boys) had no problem allowing their community to park in their lots to celebrate and enjoy the Christmas parade.

I ordered the B D G burger which is supposed to be a beef patty with arugula and sun dried tomatoes with a citrus dressing. I asked for it medium well, with broccoli substituted for fries. We also ordered onion rings for the table. We received the onion rings without any silverware or napkins, and nobody came around to ask for them. Eventually the burgers came, my husband and I both ordered the burgers bunless and with broccoli substituted. They forgot to substitute the fries on both orders, waitress went back to get the broccoli. My patty came over burnt and charcoal black, and was so hard and dry could crack it. It came with a small pile of limp and old arugula, with no citrus dressing. Again I had to ask for silverware and napkins. The patty lost all its meat flavor and I felt like I was simply eating charcoal. The ""sun dried tomatoes"" we're cold and already tasted vinegary and past their due date. As I looked down  I could even see dirty spots on the plate from the reflection of the light above. Then the broccoli came and It was very old looking and dry as well. I was so hungry and in a rush and would not have time for the food to be remade, so I sucked it up and asked for bbq sauce to mask the patty and somehow eat it. The only thing that didn't make it worse was the fact that the only edible thing was the fries, which I got by mistake. For all of that I was charged 13$, when I could have just gone to Inn-out for a PERFECTLY cooked burger and fries for $6.  Our whole bill for three burgers and onion fries was $60, and we were left with the after taste of a rip off.

We were at a table without napkins or utensils and it took some time to wait to see a waiter/waitress to flag down who idn't flash by. Then it took some time to ask for a refill. However they were there asap when it came to the bill. I don't fault the waiters/waitresses however (if any management is reading) since they looked like they were working at top speed. To me it seemed like they needed more staff and due to the lack of it they're producing bad customer service and probably losing business. And even more shocking to that was that was it seemed that it wasn't even half way full on our side of the restaurant. What happens when they get more people in... it would be horrible, just go somewhere else. -The wait for food was long. We ordered an appetizer and at least one main dish.

Then, they brought the wrong appetizer. In the meantime, several people seated after us were finishing up their meal. Manager made the appetizer right and we started our meal. Cheese curds and Jalapeno rings were good. However, burgers were very dry as I had asked for mine to be a little pink. I didn't bother asking them to fix the burger as we already had problems with appetizers and getting the food took way too long. Bratwurst on new burger had a very funny taste to it - not good... Manager took $15 off the bill but then tried to charge us for an extra Onion Ring that we didn't even order. Took them two trips to register to get it right. The whole experience was just a disaster. To top off, we mentioned that it was my daughter's birthday and they said they would sing and bring a sundae to her.

Several parties were seated ahead of us (yes smaller, but at a point at least 10-15 people were seated ahead of us), and no effort was made to combine tables. Hostess (Brittany) very rude. No smiling, yelled across the room to me after I was in process of calling to verify party number.  She had a very funky nonchalant lackadaisical attitude. If you don't like your job, why are you there?????  She definitely needs major customer service training, and I didn't appreciate the fingernail tapping on the podium after I ask to speak with the manager to find out when we are ever being seated (not something you want to do)! Told manager I'm happy to take our party elsewhere if they chose because we were tired of waiting and being ignored. Finally sit down, waitress is nice but neglected to provide utensils and we waited a decent period of time at the table and had to end up asking her to bring utensils (only brought forks). First bottomless fry order is cold but we were all stressed, hungry, and I was upset after having words with the manager about the situation. Waitress brings out courses but no knife to cut whole heads of ceasar salad. Salad was refused; (grilled, but looked horrible and unappetizing).  Whole experience was bad. Don't think I'll be back again to waste my money when I can go to other places to be appreciated and seated in a timely manner.

And 07/31/16 was my husbands birthday and out of all the places he could have chose from to have his birthday dinner he chose this place. My first disappoint was how much the servers encourage these new table top ordering tablets which takes away actual communication I believe from the customer. Why have servers? or worry about tipping a waiter or waitress when the machine does everything for you. I know that's this is at almost every restaurant but the waiters actually push it on you. My opinion. And second was that we told the host it was my husbands birthday and she advised she would let our waiter know. During the whole dinner my daughter and I were looking around to see when they would come around to sing to my husband and nothing. We ended up leaving and I had to explain to my husband that we didn't forget they just never came. My husband actually thought we forgot and I was so hurt for him. When I went up to the host to ask her what happened she said I told your waiter I'll let him know he forgot. No sorry. No nothing. I saw her go up to the waiter and they both seemed like it was nothing. To me and my family it was everything.

Food was decent, but nothing like other Red Robin restaurants I have been to.  Our server, Melissa, was impolite and inattentive.  Lunch was not very busy, but for some reason we had to continually search for our server and ask for refills.  Under par for this chain.  Won't be returning here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hemet?start=20,3.36,3.25,3.25,,3.294

I ordered the mushroom with Swiss cheese burger with tons of grilled onions. It was heaven on a bun. Meat cooked perfectly, a little pink, just the way I like it. The french fries were crispy and hot and the server we had was super nice. Only complaint was it took our server 20 minutes to take our order, but I found out later she had just come on duty, so it wasn't her fault. Other than that, this place is a winner in my book.

We were sat in the bar and the bartender was our server. She came over greeted us, and rushed away when we don't know exactly what we wanted right away. Upon second arrival she argued with me about a drink I have been enjoying there for years, and was quite nasty about it.  The attitude didn't let up the rest of the night and she even went as far as to come over and tell me they no longer carry the exact tequila so that's why they don't offer the drink...*rolls eyes* you can make it with other types of alcohol!  Our food orders were all pretty basic, of course mine was wrong and didn't shock me in the least. I just dealt with it and ate my food. Chicken was dry and salad was blah! We are still really doing iceberg Red Robin!?!? Really!?! Time to step up your game and join the big kids club, I think everyone else in town uses romaine. Fries weren't crispy like we asked for, so we had to wait for a new basket to come out.  Water refills were few and far between as the time spent at our table was so short and quick, that there wasn't even an opportunity to get the order in.  In Hemet we have a fairly good selection of sit down restaurants and I can tell you after last nights experience we won't be back for a long time to come!

The servers are always super sweet and attentive and your food is ready fast and always prepared correctly... but this time was a little different. My girlfriend was hungry so I got her favorite burger for her To-go: The Burnin' Love. Her order was perfect with tons of fries. As she was eating she noticed a plastic tag in her fries! She was grossed out and wondered where the fries had been and couldn't finish the rest of her food. We were very disappointed as we have never had a negative experience at any Red Robin location.

32,Paige M.,"Euclid, OH",4,5,,1.0,2017-07-21,"The worst burger experience I have had happened here last night. I went to eat there around 8:30pm and I was starving. Not only did I have to wait a long time to be seated but I had to walk to the back of the restaurant find someone to help us. I ordered an appetizer the same time ordering my food and when my food came out I asked him what happened to the appetizer. He looked confused so I told him to just cancel it. But wait It gets worseee....like I stated earlier I was starving so I hurry up and start eating my turkey burger but as I take like my fourth bite I realize it feels really soft and I can't taste any meat. I look down and touch my patty and literally it was raw. This burger felt like it may have sat on their grill for 1 min or less. The inside wasn't even a little bit cooked. When I showed my waiter he didn't really care. Yes, he brought me out another turkey burger but for the burger to be so raw he should have showed some more customer service.

30,VJ S.,"Idyllwild, CA",0,14,2.0,1.0,2017-07-24,"Great wait staff, but some holes. We went in for dinner, had to wait a few minutes, but no big deal.  The food we got was good for the most part but there are a number of disconnects between wait staff and the kitchen.  Very nice waitress took our order promptly,  asked if we were in Royalty Club ( we are but didn't have the card) so she said she'd fix that later- never happened. We asked for a refill on freckled lemonade, didn't come, so we asked again and then we got two.  We were asked if we wanted a refill on bottomless fries,  they never came.  What appears to be happening is that the order goes back to the kitchen via a touchscreen station and the the order gets lost back there somewhere.  Bottom line, the food is just ok, don't know what's up with the service. I can't fault the front wait staff, but I won't hurry back.  Btw I never short the wait staff on a tip unless they're just plain rude. But it's hard to get enthused about returning. Update since the last time-  1 star this time.  Do not be in a hurry because things are incredibly slow. Walked in@ 7pm on a Monday night and 30 minutes  plus to fill a simple order.

We hadn't been there in a while but decided to take my daughters teacher from a couple years ago out to lunch because we love her and missed her so... we did and she enjoyed a nice relaxed lunch and conversation. The fish platter or whatever came out Nantucket? Or smth ? Looked overcooked and too brown but maybe it's supposed to be that crispy I don't know. All in all even though it isn't very impressive food the kids enjoyed their burgers and fries and the adults enjoyed the service and conversation and the lack of noise inside the place so all in all a good experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hemet,2.96,3.16,3.16,,3.0800000000000005

Food: was alright, find a coupon; save a couple bucks, bottomless fries as with the other red robbin locations all the way to the coastal regions are slow in coming (we get it, you don't like giving the fries away - I guess the potato market is skyrocketing in price).  Enjoy the season salt and option in dipping sauces, but seriously; you charge for certain sauce to dip them in?? Drink: The tea's were umm...I'm guessing lacking fountain liquid; each one had a strange lacking to them Service: Was alright saw the bartender a couple times and 2 others dropping off food Price: With a coupon was fair $23 for 2 people Red Robin; stop guarding your bottomless fries; its not that serious and the reason I choose your spot, make it a selling point",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hemet,3.2,3.16,3.16,,3.1760000000000006

I literally came into Red Robins, nobody approached me (but all the workers were just looking at me in the front like I should seat myself). I decided to go seat myself after being unacknowledged at the bar, where a guy who works the bar looked at me, seen I was at the bar and turned right back around. I started feeling really uncomfortable so I pulled out my phone too see how long it would be before I was approached. The worker who looked at me and looked away noticed I was recording and looked frustrated so he automatically asked me (looking in my camera) ""what can I get you to drink"", I replied just water. The bartender seriously questioned me asking why I was recording him, I told him I was recording myself because it is my birthday (Jan 3rd). He got mad and threw down a couple cold drink pads and set my water on one. I told him too please not throw my items, he replied back ""dude you're at a bar"". I explained to him I don't care where I was at, I don't want my items thrown at me, he started going back and forth with me so I asked for the manager. The manager approached me very non caring explaining to me that if I record myself that I would be kicked out of the restaurant due to a post on the Window stating ""no trespassing"". I asked where it was posted that I couldn't record myself in his restaurant and he just replied back ""do you want a seat""? I replied to him ""no I would like the customer service too be better cause I'm literally uncomfortable now"". I asked his name and he did not give it too me out of fear of the bold disrespect/discrimination I was receiving. Thankfully I know an ex employee who explained his name was Javier and I definitely called Human resources on him specifically because I was almost kicked out for no reason.
