This is just like every other American fast food chain, but with a royalty card to keep you coming back, except I signed up for the card just to get the free appetizer. I had a really salty burger, with the ""unlimited"" steak fries - fyi, you don't really want to eat that many, so that's probably why its unlimited. I thought the fries were just okay, maybe I had a bad batch, since everyone says the fries are good. The drink I ordered, some strawberry soda tasting thing, was not good, but came in a pretty shaped glass. That really shouldn't be the pro.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson?start=240,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.536,3.0000000000000004
254,Mcfrancis S.,"Las Vegas, NV",439,108,325.0,3.0,2012-01-31,"I usually go to Red Robins once a week. But this was my first time going to this location. I usually get a freckled lemonade and the whisky bbq burger, this place was no exception. I would rate the food five stars. The burger comes with bottomless steak fries and the drink is also bottomless... in other words UNLIMITED REFILLS. OMG haha. Usually when you order they immediately bring out the fries first, and by the time the burger comes out I am half way full. Which is quite pleasant because normally only fit half of the burger in my stomach and the next day I eat the other half of the burger. It's like your paying for two mealss for the price of one haha. Anyways this place would've been Five stars if it weren't for the lack of service. I'm not going to lie I drink a lot of water and lemonade even before the meal comes out, but out of the hour I was there I only got my cup refilled once. -_- and after that I waited a good 15-25 minutes for my bill. But overall if you just want some deeeelicious $10 and below hamburgers then this is the place to goo. Make sure you ask for a royalty card too!!!

181,Robyn L.,"Las Vegas, NV",119,294,298.0,3.0,2012-04-01,Red Robin is just that - A-OK. It won't be the best burger you've had by any means but it'll definitely do the trick.  The service is overly friendly (reminiscent of a satirical movie - I can't remember if the server had pieces of flare).  Can't complain about that. Hubs and I went with a bacony burger on special for $7.  He ordered more fries but never got them - good thing - 1 burger and fries is plenty.  Additional fries would have caused pain.   It's relatively cheap and it will definitely fill your belly.  Great place for kids.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson?start=180,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.8280000000000003,3.0000000000000004

220,Shawn J.,"Henderson, NV",450,792,202.0,2.0,2012-04-20,"Have you ever been happy just to get the heck out of somewhere? I had that feeling tonight at Red Robin. My wife was craving a loaded cheeseburger so along with my 2 year old off we went. Being a Friday night the parking lot was almost full, my wife and I took the last two open spaces as she met us there. Once we stepped inside things went South. Rather than write war and peace let's just drop the facts:  1: They called that iced tea?  2: You quit carrying spinach and artichoke dip? WTF?  3: The Mushrooms / Zucchini appetizer picture had to be Photoshopped. What we got, well the mushrooms were edible. The zucchini was, well, ugh! 4: Normally the Fish and Chips are good. I've had them in Kansas City, Denver, and Vegas. Tonight's batch failed. Blah, boring, undercooked. Why mince words, it sucked.  5: I asked for malt vinegar sauce. 3 requests later someone finally gets it.  6: I would like my steak fries to be warm, preferably when they come to the table I want them hot enough when served that I don't want to keep my fingers on them for long. What I got made me wonder if the cook was celebrating 4/20 prior to coming to work.  7: 1.19 for two lame little bitty slices of avacado that looked like it was on it's last legs? Really? Pathetic.  8: My 2 year old thought the mac and cheese sucked. He ate two bites, thankfully the orange they served with it was good as that's all he ate. And it's hard to make kids food suck but they rose to the occasion.  9: On the way out we had to walk past a bunch of servers and a manager who wouldn't clear a path and they were talking about a large party that came in. The manager said and I quote ""I don't know where in the f*** to sit them, either they wait or they can sit on the damn floor"".  Needless to say I was happy to leave. Thankfully the Cupcakery that shares the same parking lot was still open to provide some sustenance that actually tasted good.   On my way home the way my stomach feels it made me wonder if I might need some Syrup of Ipecac before the night's over.  2 Stars: Our server was overworked but tried his best. And 1 star goes for the TV's that let me see the end of the Giants / Mets game.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson?start=220,3.08,3.08,3.08,2.7600000000000007,3.0800000000000005

As with BJs right down the street, you can seat yourself at the high top tables in the bar or directly at the bar. Service is quick. Doesn't make the food any better, but it makes the experience tolerable. Anyway, the food: I just discovered my adoration of any burger with a fried egg on it. RR has one and it's tasty.

209,Anthony P.,"Las Vegas, NV",129,115,11.0,3.0,2012-09-26,"I'll never understand why people rate such a major difference among restaurants from the same chain. This Red Robin tastes like any other Red Robin I see. Hell, blindfold me and take me to each Red Robin without me knowing and I still won't know the difference. It's just like movie theaters, they have all the same movies and expensive prices for snacks. The difference that separates each chain restaurant is the service and etc. This Red Robin's service is inconsistent. Though our servers are always nice, I remember one in particular who just showed no personality or emotions. I felt like I was talking to a wall. She made me feel that I shouldn't even be there and that she shouldn't be there. Otherwise, most servers are courteous. The only issue I have is their inconsistency. They're not as timely as other Red Robins but I would actually blame the fact that there aren't enough waitresses. When I was there, I would only see 3 maybe 4 at most servers working.

We got the jalapeno coins (which I will probably get again next time I'm back) and the onion rings. Both were actually pretty good. I probably enjoyed those more than my burger and garlic fries. I used to come here years ago for garlic fries but it doesn't seem up to par this time. Granted, it's been a few years, or maybe they were kind of soggy or maybe the appetizers filled me up already. It just didn't taste quite the same. I split the burger (prime chophouse?) with my friend cause we can't finish one whole burger. To be honest, we didn't even finish our half burger nor our fries.

On the menu, the veggie burger was specified as Morningstar Griller's Prime, and I even asked the waiter to be sure. When the burger arrived, it was a Gardenburger.

The food prep put tons of mushrooms which spilled all over my plate and the oils have soaked up the buns. It was very difficult to eat. I also ordered a strawberry milkshake that was about $5.00.

The thing Red Robin is known for is serving bottomless fries with their burgers. Of note, you can substitute the bottomless fries for other items for free and certain items for a small extra charge ranging from broccoli to sweet potato fries. The burger is also customizable such as what type of bun among other things. Signing up for their loyalty card does win you a free burger in your birthday month every year and other discounts & offers throughout the year. The most recent visit, my friend & I had a very helpful and attentive waitress named Medina I believe?

This is burger heaven, and I love the fact that you can substitute the typical red meat patty for a Boca or Gardenburger patty if you're vegetarian like I am. This past visit was pretty decent. The server we had was very attentive and friendly and the food was right on par. Only downside is that our server forgot to ask if we would like fries while we waited on our lunch. I didn't bother to ask because they typically ask or just automatically bring them to you. So we waited for ten minutes until our lunch arrived and once it did, they brought my mom fruit instead of fries as her side. So then I asked for a basket of fries. Mom ordered the Simple Burger and it didn't come with cheese. Neither of us noticed that it didn't from the menu, so we had to ask for a slice of cheese on the side.  At the end of the day, the food was great and the fries are always great. Only downfall is that we were both starving and didn't get the bottomless fries treatment.

It's like walking into a completely different restaurant, it's just decorated the same.  We visited on a Saturday night and got seated at the bar right away. I initially thought ""here we go...the bartender is also our server and he's going to forget about us"". Boy was I wrong. Our server came over right away and took our drink order. We weren't quite sure what we wanted for dinner yet so we started with the jalapeno coins and some french fries & ranch (their ranch is seriously like crack. I love it here. It's creaminess and consistency set it out from the rest). Our server accommodated us and got us our apps hot & fresh right away! P.S. their strawberry lemonade is heavenly, has fresh strawberries floating in it and has unlimited refills. YES! I did notice that Red Robin had a newer menu. It's more condensed and organized, which I found helpful, as their last one was like a bible. So thick and took forever to get through. My fiancé chose the Royal Red Robin Burger which is like breakfast on a bun - meat, cheese, an over easy egg, bacon, mayo and garden. I chose the Crispy Chicken Burger - just chicken and cheese only. When our food came out we were excited to see our fries presently beautifully in a little medal cylinder. It made it look like a fancy dish....not just scattered amongst the plate. My fiancé's burger was cooked perfect and he enjoyed it (more like inhaled it! lol). My chicken sandwich came out with black bubbles of cheese and was burnt :( The bartender took control of the situation and got me a fresh one right away. It was juicy, tender and flavorful the second time around so I was a happy camper. My fiancé really enjoyed the spicy dipping sauce that came with the jalapeno coins. He kept dipping his burger in it and asking for more :D  For dessert we ordered the Mud Pie. It was delicious, tasty and they put extra hot fudge in the dish for me. YAY! The cookie crumb crust was delightful! I vowed never to eat at RR again after my terrible experience at the mall, however due to the Eastern location AND their great customer service....we will be return customers now.

82,Mike F.,"Las Vegas, NV",214,619,4077.0,5.0,2013-08-27,"We've lived in the area for over a year and this was our first visit to this Red Robin. Reading the reviews I wasn't really sure what we were going to get but this ended up being such a great experience! Granted, we went at around 8pm on a Monday night, so the place was pretty slow. In fact, I believe there were maybe 5 other tables occupied in the entire place.  So when we first walk in, we are greeted at the door and seated by the greeter and less than 2 minutes later we are greeted by our server, Steven. We order our drinks and Steven mentions a few suggestions since we had mentioned this was our first visit here. Upon his recommendation I ordered the Royal Red Robin burger(10.49), while my friend ordered the Chili Cheese burger (9.99). Both burgers came with ""Bottomless steak fries"". They do give you the option to switch those out with a different style of fries, if you wish. We stuck with the steak fries and figured we'd just go with that.  I had been craving a burger all day, so sinking my teeth into that tasty burger was sweeeeet! Very fat and juicy! Plus I love the over-easy egg on top! That was the first time I had tried that on a burger and I definitely enjoyed it! The steak fries were the thick cut variety (which I love) and were pretty tasty as well. After 2 servings, that seemed to be plenty for me. My friend seemed to thoroughly enjoy his chili cheese burger and also indicated other burgers on the menu he wanted to try out on future visits. The service was great! It was perfect that Steven was attentive and brought refills in such a timely fashion! He repeatedly checked in on us and attended to our needs during the meal. Just because a place is slow doesn't necessarily translate to great service. Trust me, I've experienced that first hand many times. But that certainly wasn't the case here! In fact everybody here was so friendly, we even had 2 other employees wish us a good night as we were heading out of the place. We were both like, ""Damn""! lol  I honestly can't think of a reason why this wasn't a 5 star experience. It was pretty much a flawlessly pleasant experience and we will DEFINITELY be back for multiple visits! I just hope future visits are as good, they've set the bar pretty high for themselves.

Tonight was a huge let down. Usually they have bigger and reasonable portions for the common person. I never questioned paying 10$ for a wrap because I knew it was of fair size. Tonight I discovered the drastic change in portion as well as the increase in price. Red Robin is NOT gormet.  It is a American burger place known for fries, shakes, and burgers. They should not charge higher pricing and give their customers bearly half of what used to be given. You can say I'm outraged but paying 13$ for a lack-luster plate of food and a bill for three being 60$ is a little outrageous for burgers. The food is GOOD. Always has been.

286,Marie B.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,10,,2.0,2013-11-07,"First time for a bad review. And I want to say I do miss the Red Robin on Decatur.  I do not get to RR as much as I would have liked because they are all a distance from me anymore. So when I go to Doctor on that side of town I try to get there. Only once about 10 years ago I had a bad experience with them and up until yesterday they have always been the greatest in every way, Walked before 4pm, was mostly deserted. A first for anytime I have been to any RR. We were seated and then had to wait a bit before we were asked what we would like to drink, me? Iced tea, my guest coffee.My tea cam and it looked like a drop of color was added to water. NO TEA. So called server and he said he would get some from another station which was not really much better. Should have just had water. My guest was still waiting for his coffee. We had decided what we were going to have, mine always the Seafood Scatter. My guest chose a burger, Finally his coffee came. Long wait and we were finally served. My guest, his burger he said was good, We needed more napkins  and finally got a bus boy to get us some.My shrimp and clam strips were good but when I bit into the cod it was like a piece of gristle, The cod pieces were VERY small any way. I had fished a good part of my life off the CA coast for every cod imaginable and this was truly BLAH. Fries were not many and at no time were we asked if we wanted more fries. That has never happened before. Nor were we asked for or got a refill on coffee or tea. Almost 3$ for a drink of watered tea. By that time I was to tired and not happy and did not want to create a scene even tho there were not many to hear me if I did. The server put the bill on the table. I asked for a to go box and most of the time when the servers see there are NO MORE fries they will add a few. But not the time. There fries are excellent if you can get any.  Well I got the bill ready and waited and waited and again flagged a bus boy and asked for out server. He came and we paid the bill. Took the teeny pieces of cod with NO fires home. Normally I will snack on my doggie bag in the evening, Got the teeny piece and a half home and a couple hours later decided to have it. The cod was tough!!!!!!!!! First time in my life I have had tough cod and I am 78 years old and fished for years. Was barely a bite in the  piece to just tossed in garbage disposal.  Extremely disappointed and will not go back and I cannot count the times I have been to Red Robins and in the past so looked forward to the seafood platter, Should have turned into In'N""Out just down the street.

Me & my fam frenz started off with the shorty o-rings & the wings n'yukon chips which were island style-maui amazing. I had the bacon cheeseburger which was good.

Red Robin is great spot for some pretty decent burgers and chicken sandwiches. The bright colors and décor scream family friendly and they definitely go out of their way to please young children. (The TV in the floor is cool touch) On an average visit you will hear their rendition of the birthday song several times. Fortunately, there is a full bar and good happy hour for the grown-ups.  It had been a while since the last time I was here so I convinced some friends to check it out around lunch time. We were promptly seated by the host and greeted by our server, little did we know that this was going to be the last time we saw her. I decided to get my usual, the peppercorn burger and onion rings to share. After we made our selections, we waited for our server to return... and waited and waited and waited. About ~20minutes later one of the bussers came over looking confused and asked if someone had helped us. He acted like we had just taken menus from the front and just sat down randomly. Soon after a new server appeared, for whatever reason she seemed annoyed that we were there; as if we had done something wrong. For whatever reason our food came out in waves; after the onion rings I was the first to get my food. We were expecting the other two dishes to come our soon but they took almost 30 minutes. My friend who ordered the bruschetta chicken sandwich was brought out the fish and chips instead, I have no idea who they mixed that up. They brought out her correct order later but our other friend and I were long finished with our food. My request for an additional serving of the ""bottomless fries"" also seemed to have been quickly forgotten as well.

I haven't had something I didn't like, but I really come here for the freckeled lemonade and bottomless fries more so than the burgers! I don't know why but I was hooked on their seasoning for the fries!  They usually have my favorite beers on tap depending on the season, Sam Adams seasonal. Which is another addd bonus. I don't usually come here during Happy Hour but when I do, I switch out the lemonade for the beer!  I haven't had bad service here yet and they're pretty quick, even when I was with a party of 10. All of us ended up getting freckeled lemonade and we cleaned them out of glassware! Didn't know that was possible, we were quite entertained by it.  My only real complaint is that if you don't pick your times right, you'll find yourself in a very loud resturant with a lot of children who don't behave.

My friend ordered the whiskey river bbq burger... now that's one delicious burger. it's worth the calories, take my word! Only order that if you love bbq sauce just an fyi. I ordered the sweet potatoe fries for an additional cost and that was very good too. Only reason why I gave -.5 I request for medium rare... meat was completely cooked through. Maybe cause the patty is quite thin or while it was sitting on the warmer plate it may have cooked on its own. This is my first Yelp review I am writing so thank you red robins for a great dinner.

Our waitress, Sonia, was dragging her feet the whole time! Never cleared the empty appetizer dishes from the table... I had to! Drink refills? Nope! Bottomless root-beer float? I got one refill that I had to stop the waitress and ask for. The fries were cold and stale. Like I mentioned, the worst service I've experienced!

She promptly brought back our kids' drinks and forgot our waters and drinks. It took ten minutes to get two waters and a beer. Five minutes after that she took our order.  FOURTY-FIVE minutes later we got our food. We have already been here for an hour. Why on earth could it possibly take this long for 4 burgers and fries? None of our drinks were refilled. Ever. The manager brought us our food and my husband asked him to bring a new drink and refill our sons drink, I also asked him for the two sides of honey mustard we were missing. He proceeded to tell me we were asking for to much. Sorry sir, but if my waitress ever came by I'd ask her instead. Waited Almost ten minutes for honey mustard, which was brought by two members of the kitchen staff... Not sure what that was all about.  My burger was sooooo greasy that within two minutes the bun was a soggy disaster. The burger was falling apart faster than I could eat it, and the bun had turned completely to mush.  Fries and especially their honey mustard, great as always. So I guess the two stars are for the honey mustard if I'm being honest. We sat there as our two year olds who had finally had enough started getting antsy and knocking everything to the floor. It was probably 15 minutes before we were actually done eating before we saw our server again, in which she dropped off the check and walked off. Had to hunt her down to actually get her to run the card so we could leave. Awful awful customer service. And they either need to get more hardcore buns or cut WAY back on the grease so avoid the soggy disaster that is served to you.  My advice red robin? Fire everyone at this location and start over.

He was very polite, asked us how we were and how many were in the party. When we told him the number, he said politely ""give me just a few moments while we set something up for."" He was super energetic and I could clearly tell he loved being there. When he walked up, we had a manager come over to ask if we had been helped, we said yes. I think he said his name was Matt. Plain blue shirt and no name tag. He started talking to us and I'm sorry but he was VERY arrogant. He kept on making the same jokes over and over. We laughed it off, but I was unimpressed. Our host Michael came back and said I have it all set up for you and I take you back now with a smile. We gathered the troops and headed back. He politely waited for us all to take a seat (and we we're long lol) but he had a good spirit and laughed with us as we tried to find our positions. Kameya was our server. And she was WONDERFUL! Very joyful and helpful. As we got our appetizers, Matt came back around to (again, sorry to say, BOTHER US!) He repeated the same jokes again. And I kept thinking, does he not remember us from 10 minutes ago!!! He stood there for about 10 minutes continuing to talk and I just grew tiresome. I was there to eat and enjoy with my family and friends that were in town. I understand that he was checking on us, but C'MON! We're smiling and laughing eating a tower of onion rings. Just leave us ALONE! We are having a good time. All in all, the food was great, Michael and Kameya were amazing! They even thanked us again for coming in as we were leaving!

I am a huge fan of their onion ring tower, but by the time my hubby and I split one of those, we never have room for the burger and fries. I asked our server if it was possible to sub the small order of rings for the fries with our burgers. BTW, you can do that for a $1.49 charge. Totally worth it.  I ordered the whiskey river BBQ burger, medium, with the onion rings. Burger was cooked perfectly. Onion rings maybe could have been pulled about 15 seconds earlier. Not too big of a deal, just a smidge darker than usual, but certainly not burnt.  Our server, Tony, was awesome.

The broth was just a bit on the greasy side but that's probably where a lot of the incredible flavor comes from.  The onions floating in the soup were cooked just a bit more than crisp-tender so they weren't soggy and slimy but rather kept their form and texture without that raw onion bite I detest so much. The soup came with pita bread doused in garlic and cheese sprinkles.  Yum, my tummy was not just satisfied but ecstatic and (in case you wonder) the soup stayed exactly where it was meant to stay, in my stomach... my apologies if you're eating a meal whilst reading this and have a vivid imagination...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson?start=200,3.24,3.28,3.28,2.868,3.2640000000000007

143,Stan C.,"Henderson, NV",135,380,203.0,4.0,2014-12-30,"Ambience: There were six of us for dinner including two grandchildren ages 4 & 7. Showing up with 6 people for dinner at other restaurants has presented a major problem, not so at this Red Robin. Despite the fact that the restaurant was crowded with people waiting, after just 5 minutes they seated us at a round table that was an appropriate size for 6 people. We were far enough away from other tables that we didn't feel like we were bothering people at the next table with our children and the other tables were far enough away from us that their kids didn't bother us. The restaurant provided balloons and crayons and paper to draw on for the little ones. This is a major asset. Food: you don't come to Red Robin for gourmet food. You come for good food at fair prices. The children's menu is fairly extensive. And it is reasonably priced. We had one mac and cheese and 1 grilled cheese sandwich. I sampled each and both were really good. It came with sides that included a choice of a couple of fruits or vegetables or the omnipresent french fries. I had the Southwest grilled chicken salad. The salad was fresh, the chicken was tasty, and they had fried jalapeno that were surprisingly delicious. The portions were large so no one left hungry. Service: our waiter came to our table fairly rapidly after we sat down. He took our drink orders immediately. He came back for a food order in a timely fashion. He got everything right. Service with a smile. I especially liked that the restaurant manager was present throughout the meal and stopped by our table at least 2 times to make sure that everything was going well.

Usually when I go to a Red Robin in a different location it takes forever for them to bring me what I need whether it be napkins, campfire or ranch sauce, or a refill on my bottomless lemonade! But I can't stress enough about how my server was on top of everything! I didn't need to ask for anything at all. She brought like 5 napkins right off the bat, the shortie rings with ranch and campfire sauce and then another ranch and campfire sauce when our burgers came. The thing I noticed the most though was when I ordered the strawberry lemonade it came in a curvy glass and when she brought me a refill without me asking it was in a huge glass! That's never happened before because at other locations I would just get a refill on the curvy glass but I wasn't complaining! ^-^ the manager even stopped by to ask us how we were doing and if she could get us anything and got us our 3rd refill!

They forgot the sauce I asked for at first order and it was promptly brought out.   To recap.   -My food took 1 hour 20 mins to get there from the time we sat down. Was missing sauce I ordered.  -My son never received his fruit salad but was charged for it (I didn't complain because it was $1.49 and I didn't want to be stuck at the restaurant any longer).  We fed him some snacks from the diaper bag -my wife just ordered pretzel bites because she wasn't very hungry.  They came out after about 45 mins of waiting and were obviously sitting for quite some time.   -I did not receive a drink refill or was I asked if I needed a refill (I was empty).

After leaving there, i felt ashamed because i didnt leave a 20% tip for the first time ever. Now today, after going to many other red robins and even that same one, I get the same waitress. My mind was made up; If she told me no fries to start I was leaving. Sure enough, nope can have fries. I immediately said ok we are leaving ( i was with two others). The manager rushed over to correct the situation. He told me that she meant to say that it will be a bit, not no we cant. So either one of them was lying. I dont deal with horrible customer service.

Their onion rings are amazing their shakes are to die for and the burgers are actually really good. The only problem is they are too pricey!

The staff was really nice, but 5 bucks for a lemonade is rough.  The glass they serve it in i guess is supposed to be fun but it was kind of awkward. The sandwich I ordered came prepared wrong. I got a sorry and we could make you another from the server. Maybe half off the lemonade would have been nice? Was in a rush so that was not an option.  The sandwich itself the Chicken Bruschetta was a little rubbery and the produce on it was terrible making the sandwich pretty un-enjoyable.  I would have given a two since the food came out wrong and was not too terrific,  but the staff was very nice about everything.

All 5 of them. Lol  2. We sat what felt like forever for our burgers and fries. When a table that was sat a good 15 minutes after us received their food before ours.  3. Never offered more fries 4. I make better tasting burgers on my backyard BBQ. The meat was just meh... 5. Food arrived cold not even warm. I swear it had been done and forgot to be ran out to us.  6. A take out box wasn't offered we had to ask for one.  7. Literally the waitress took our order and brought us a check. She never stopped over to ask if our food was delicious because I had taken 2 bites and was done you I would think she would have wondered if something was wrong.

My mother and I went on Sunday, after church. Our server was Bruce, who was very friendly, but extremely harried and forgetful; a lunch that should have taken less than an hour took us two whole hours!! That's Olive Garden slowness, not typical Red Robin speed. Our orders were simple: two burgers. Mine was fine, but mom ordered a chicken Whisky River BBQ and it was so salty that she had them remake it. That wasn't a huge issue, though. If you ever eat here, only eat with Bruce if you're not in a hurry - he was slow when refilling our drinks, we had to ask for boxes three times because he kept walking away and doing other sidework for his empty tables. I overheard how he forgot things for one of his other tables next to us. And while he was pleasant, he would essentially come by, set your food down, and rush off to do whatever else he was thinking about. Not a good Red Robin experience at all; probably my worst.

Upon entering, met by a snarky host- seats us by the bathrooms, after we clearly requested not to be. Place wasn't even half full, and there was a table, (clean) further away. Requested that table, he mistook one that was dirty and immediately replied ""I am not cleaning that table for you"" and walked away. Next, ordered spinach dip without onions. MANAGER delivered them to the table. Pointed out to her dip was ordered without onions. She asked if it was because of allergies, we responded no, just don't want onions. She gave us a nasty look and said ""Fine, we will fix it""- when she returned with it, they had scooped out the center of the dip, covered it with a tiny bit of cheese and slammed it down on the table. Mind you we are in los of the kitchen.... so we saw it in action. Our food order sat in window for ten minutes, waiter and manager were giggling about it sitting there. Finally one waitress overheard our comment re be nice to get our order... brought it out, food quality was HORRIBLE. Chicken was old and rubbery- nasty. So, they get a star, not because they earned it, but because I can't  choose lesser value. Kenny- get it together, manager- take a nap or something- you are not a good example of quality service. It is no wonder why your staff are as poorly responsive as you are. Never again- matter of fact- considering call to corporate- so many more nasty little occurances, too numerous to list here.

It was a busy night and I understand that, but we had to wait 10 minutes for our waiter to even approach our table for our drink order. Not to mention the random stop he made at our table, barely acknowledging us, because he mixed up another tables receipt in the ziosk . When he got to our table he was rushing us through our order and when we finally got our food one of the orders were wrong. So we had to wait again for the correct plate to arrive. Half way through our dinner we were all out of drinks and we tried using their new ""Ziosk"" to order drinks, which personally I don't think is the way we should have to order our drinks, but the option wasn't even available so we sat waiting. While we were waiting for drinks the waiter told us his ""trainee"" would be getting our drinks.

Second time we have been here since the remodel, and AGAIN the menu has changed. The biggest change was the raise in prices. A $10 to $15 Hamburger is not a family friendly price.

Instead of fries I chose to substitute with a cup of French Onion soup which cost extra, that's fine, Surprise, they have new dishes, that include a small square shaped bowl that probably holds 3 ounces, but by the time they put in the bread, I may have had 2 Tsp. of broth,  My one daughter ordered a burger which she ate 1/2, saying it didn't have much flavor.

Tonight when my boyfriend and I visited, the service was outright terrible. (Although it was more the server's fault than the restaurant itself.) Our waitress was Megan. Our appetizer took forever to come out and when we finally got it, it was obvious that it had been sitting for a long time. We also ordered more fries while we were waiting for our appetizer that we never received. When I finally got my $15 burger, it was completely overcooked and burnt even though I asked for it medium rare. By the time my burger was fixed, I didn't even want it anymore. There were multiple times throughout the dinner when we had to ask other servers or management to get our food because our server didn't check at all to see if it was ready.

But I'm a paying customer and it's unacceptable to treat anyone different than you would a more ""distinguished"" looking customer. She gave us the wrong drinks which we were charged for and slammed them on the table and asked ""y'all ready or not"". The food runner came and was very nice but we were not checked on for at least 15 minutes. As a waiter myself, I would get an ass chewing for doing so. Meanwhile she continued to serve everyone around us, while having a smile on her face. Everyone except for us. After another 15 minutes of waiting she came over to see if we were ready to pay. I informed her of the charged drinks, she fixed it, then slammed the computer thing in front of me. At this point I'm pretty pissed off. I honestly contemplated leaving the restaurant without paying. Sadly I don't remember her name because I would've put her on blast on here. I find it shitty because I frequent this restaurant and always get really great service. Just not this time. I'll most likely come back again because my little brothers like the food.

41,Melanie V.,"Henderson, NV",96,94,9.0,1.0,2016-02-06,"I am super annoyed tonight. I am updating my review of this location to 1 star.  Let me say, my kids and I used to come to this location literally about one a week, several years ago. It has drastically gone downhill over time.  My little one for some reason remembered that this location has a chalk board in the lobby when we were walking through the parking lot. Got inside, only to realize they are out of chalk. First disappointment.  We were seated, and the hostess didn't give my little one any crayons or paper like they normally do. We asked the server, and we were told they are also out of crayons, but that the manager was trying to find some in the back. Second disappointment.  I ordered the freckled lemonade, which was very watered down, and only had 2 pieces of strawberry in it. Third disappointment.  I ordered the Royal burger, no bacon, with a veggie patty. The burger came out with 2 giant pieces of bacon it. Normally I would ask the kitchen to remake the burger, but based on my last experience last week at this same location, I didn't bother.  Side note, last week I ordered the croissant blta, no bacon. Of course, the sandwich came out with bacon on it. I asked them to remake the sandwich, and it was brought out just a few moments later. I took off the top piece of croissant to see, and sure enough, there were 2 holes where the wooden sticks had been put through the sandwhich. They didn't remake anything, just removed the bacon. I could have done that myself I guess. Good thing I'm not allergic!  Back to this visit. Ate my food, and drank my water I had ordered in place of the lemonade. Decided to order dessert to go. I ordered the freckled lemonade cake. I have had this dessert about 4 times now.  Well, I just opened my cake and there is no strawberry sauce or strawberries! Seriously?!? Isn't that the point? I told the manager about most of this when she stopped by our table. She didn't have much to say other than ""I'm sorry"" and ""we will try to do better."" Then she took our $4 onion rings off of the bill.  Ugh.  I am really disappointed. We used to come all the time, and have been customers since this location opened in 2005. We most likely won't be going back for a while. The service has slowly been declining. They won't even take your payment if you are using a debit card. You have to do it yourself on the little kiosk things. Super annoying.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson?start=40,2.2,2.65,2.65,2.436,2.47

97,Amanda B.,"Lancaster, CA",0,6,3.0,2.0,2016-02-25,"I am SO ANNOYED with this location's to-go service!  I am giving two stars because things I enjoy about this establishment are: 1) They've never gotten my order wrong and 2) The food has always been up to par and consistent with other locations.  HOWEVER, I call to place an order to go on a weekday, and they immediately put me on hold to transfer my call. Like, why does my call need to be transferred? Aren't most calls for to go orders? Why is there no designated person to answer the phone, ready to take orders? On top of that, I'm on hold for 6 MINUTES before I hang up and try again. My call gets answered in just two rings, and I get placed on hold again...FOR FOUR MORE MINUTES. That's when my husband and I decided to get dinner elsewhere. Obviously they don't want our money, they don't value our business.  Other times I've gotten through and placed an order successfully over the phone, I show up the 15-20 quoted minutes later to have to wait around the bar (once a whole 20 more minutes--yeah, my fries were soggy).  My take-out experiences with this place are just so bad that I am not sure it will even be an option for us anymore. It's not worth the battle. It makes me mad to get bad service, and then I don't even get the food I want out of it, because I can't justify sticking around for bad service--and they don't care. I could yell or speak with the manager or whatever, but then I just become ""that"" customer. I'd rather just vent with this review and encourage the staff to STEP THEIR GAME UP.  Please.

The service this time was good. The host quickly greeted us and food was tasty. Our server rachel asked me if I wanted my burger with some pink in it (which made me happy since that's how I always want my burger and my previous visit the server told me the meat is too thin and it's not possible).

30,Katelyn P.,"Las Vegas, NV",163,223,42.0,4.0,2016-10-05,"I have always loved this Red Robin's location. They recently updated the interior, which makes it seem even more inviting. Last night, we visited to celebrate my Dad's birthday. After some confusion by the woman at the front, we were quickly seated. I really appreciated that they removed a chair so my grandma's wheelchair could fit in place of the chair. It's the little things. Since we are regulars, we ordered as soon as our waiter came over. Our waiter was Marquese (I hope I spelled that right!) and he was super awesome, funny, and just a great guy. I asked him about the dairy free options since their online allergen menu was finicky, and he was able to answer all my questions. He took our orders back, and was quick to let us know that the kitchen was out of one of the items we ordered, but we picked something else. And, when we finished eating, they brought my dad an ice cream and sang to him! It seems silly, but I really wanted to make sure they acknowledged his birthday for him. Like I said, it's the little things. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I absolutely hate the stupid tablets on the table.  For some reason, we had 3 on our table when we sat down, and we moved the other two away without realized that they were all registered to different tables. So when it came time to pay the bill, we sat around waiting because our little tablet never lit up, because it was on someone else's table. I wish the waiters would either teach us how to use it, or just do it for us. I haven't been back here since before they started using the tablets, so I was lost when it came time to order and pay. I also dislike that their online allergen menu is wonky. I know this isn't a problem specific to this Red Robin, and luckily our waiter was knowledgeable about allergens, but I would hate to go back and get a waiter that didn't know. I just hope this review gets passed on to the people that can change this information. Overall, this is a great location to visit and I will definitely be back. Hopefully I learn how to use the tablet by then!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson?start=20,3.0,2.64,2.64,2.768,2.7840000000000003

Just two burgers and fries cost $24! I don't think I have ever eaten a drier burger in all my life!! Even when I dipped each bite in ranch, I had a really hard time choking half of it down. The other burger was just as hockey puck dry. I was truly disappointed,  since these burgers cost an arm and a leg, I thought they would at LEAST taste good.

This time our waitress brought them in normal soda glasses right away. Which we loved. Not only did we not have to keep bugging her for refills but she didn't have to keep running and getting them.

After 20 years of killing my poor hubby's steaks, I finally watched enough Food Network to be able to make him a perfect steak. He licked the plate. Anyway, I finally gave in and tried steak. Turns out, I LOVE beef. I started slow, but finally tried a hamburger for the first time about a month ago. I did not like it at all. Ground meat has a very odd texture to someone who has never eaten it before. It was a homemade burger. Fast forward to today. I had a gift card someone had given me, so we came in to check it out. We ordered the onion ring tower (awesome!), I got a bacon cheeseburger (huge!) with the garlic fries, one of my daughters got a burger and fries and my other daughter got the mac and cheese and steak fries (this daughter is vegetarian). I was terrified I'd hate it, but I totally get it now!!! That bacon cheeseburger has changed my life! It was simple, but exactly what I wanted. No, it was exactly what I NEEDED. I am now a fan of burgers, for the first time in my life. I'm very picky, so you can count on me to come back and order the same thing every time because I know it'll be great. I also need to mention that my daughter's mac and cheese was to DIE for! We live across town, and I almost ordered more to go so we could have it again for dinner.  Cheyenne was our server, and she was crazy busy, but super nice and really great, as was everyone else who helped us.

I'm not sure what the reason was, but we didn't have to wait any more than 5 minutes and the host was pleasant. When we were walking to our booth all I noticed was how filthy the floor was. Straw wrappers, French fries, napkins. It wasn't a few spots, it was the whole place. It was a huge turn off. We ordered 2 iced teas, an order of the pretzel bites, and split a Black Pepper Burger ($32 with the tip). Even though it seemed like a long time to get our food, I may have just been impatient.

We were fully expecting some sort of an after-church lunch rush, but were pleasantly surprised to be seated right away by a hostess who was very cheerful and kind. This essentially NEVER happens to us because we come in with a double stroller containing an our 8 month old special needs foster son and our 14 month old daughter. And to top it off, we also have our 4 year old son. We tend to enter restaurants expecting to get a ""could you please wait one moment?"" while the hostess frantically searches for an empty area somewhere that she can stick our circus. Which, by the way, we honestly don't take offense to.... we totally get it. Lol.  Anyway. We were seated right away, and greeted right away by our waitress, Vanessa. Vanessa is AWESOME. She was prompt, polite, and didn't look at us sideways NOT EVEN ONCE for bringing 3 kids under 4 out for lunch. She had our drinks and appetizer out within minutes. And by minutes, I mean MAYBE 3-4 tops. We placed our order, and even our food arrived to our table within 15 minutes. All of our food was steaming hot and SO good. I stick to a mostly vegan diet, so Red Robin is somewhat of a ""rare unicorn"" thing for me. I went all in (since it was the fiance's birthday and all) and had the new salmon sandwich. HOLY SHIT. Order this damn thing! AT ONCE! I can't even explain, it was just perfection with each bite. My fiance always gets the burnin' love burger made with chicken and swears by it.

Well things have changed. The burgers are now mediocre and the presentation is lackluster. The ""bottomless"" fries are now served in a tiny tin cup thing that gives you 10 fries at most which means you eat them in the first two minutes, and that leads to the reason for my low 2 star review. Service is less than adequate. The company in trying to save money has increased their servers work load to the point of ridiculousness. If you have 3 people eating and everyone eats at a different pace that means the server will have to refill each persons side at least once, that's minimum of three refills per table and if the server has 5 tables that's 15 trips to the back to get just refills on sides, not to mention taking orders, running food, refilling drinks and any other responsibilities they may have.

43,Aubrei G.,"Las Vegas, NV",166,7,1.0,2.0,2017-09-12,"It was my first time eating at a Red Robin location. My husband and I had to wait 5 minutes for the hostess, there was only one which we understand. The first server said that he would take care of us but after 5 or 10 minutes he did not return another young lady came up and asked us if we would like something to drink over the shoulder of my husband without looking at him, and gave us water. I asked for lemon and never got it. We also ordered my husband's burger no tomato and tomato was present on the burger. We also ordered my husband burger no tomato and to meet it was present on the burger. The food was otherwise absolutely delicious which is why it makes me sad to make this review. None of the servers that we spoke to introduce themselves or apologized for any inconvenience. After calling over a supervisor he also did not introduce himself but did apologize saying that they were ""swamped, and only had 2 servers"". Me being a server I can understand that. But none the less you can make the experience more personable. Like you're happy to have my business.

That said, I can't remember the last time I went to one and it seems like they've made several changes: menu has expanded to offer a premium line of burgers and they have more chicken sandwiches, salads, and other non-burger entrees. There are also a lot of customization options from buns to fry sauces (some with an upcharge) and ""premium"" sides that I don't recall from previous visits. The Bleu Ribbon burger was decent, with fried onion straws and a good amount of cheese. I upgraded my fries to the garlic-parm version, which were just a sprinkle of fried garlic and a pinch of cheese added to the regular steak fries- the flavor was pretty subtle. Note that burgers here must be cooked to at least medium, for some reason.  Service at the bar was adequate and one guy in particular was especially outgoing. All seats/tables are provided with a touch screen to summon your server, review featured specials, or play games while you wait. I'm all for using tech to streamline services but pushing a button to summon the bartender right in front of you is just weird.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson,3.16,2.95,2.948,,3.0340000000000007

The fact that one can get lost in a burger menu is amazing.  You get unlimited refills on your fries or salad and we were able to actually get our waitresses attention and order a second helping (not that it was needed). I had the big Sir Acha Tavern with a salad and the wife had the Whiskey River BBQ with fries. Okay, they do not explain the Big burger to you so I asked. It is $2.5 more so you expect a bigger burger.... well hold on. It is the same 1/3 oz patties, but they are made into one burger. So same start weight, theoretically you end up with more meat in the end because the thicker burger will not cook down as far as two individual burgers. Did I notice a huge difference? No. I did notice that there was more moisture left in the big patty than when you get the smaller ones. The fries were rather good tonight, crispy outside and soft inside and the salad was actually refreshing. I had the Ghost pepper burger on my last visit, the Sir Acha seemed spicier to me.

13,Breanna C.,"Henderson, NV",1,24,64.0,1.0,2017-11-27,"First and foremost this rating does not reflect the quality of the food I've had but the management or at least one manager.  I called in and ordered a free birthday burger I had earned. After picking up the burger which was a veggie burger and getting home ready to eat it and realized that I had been given a BBQ bacon cheddar burger. I then called up and spoke to a manager who was super nice and told me to come back up and they would remake the burger and comp me a free dessert. Great I thought, well I ended up not making it back up there (long day at work and I was tired).  Fast forward to today, I make it back up there and bring in the incorrect uneaten burger to show. The manager who I spoke with the night before along with another manager who already seemed to have some sort of attitude. She told me that I'd just get the burger but no dessert. Anyone who has ever ordered from RR knows they tell you it takes 15-20 minutes for any of the burgers and fries to be prepared. The female manager came out in LESS than 5 minutes with the burger.  Obviously she couldn't be bothered to remake a fresh burger for me and the free dessert I was told I'd receive as well. I get it, some will argue and say ""But it was free anyway"", well I'd hate to see how things would've been handled had I paid for it. As a manager you can't be mad for a mistake one of your employees made when boxing up the order or that I did not come in again the same night. What if I didn't have a car or had the luxury just to come whenever? Bottom line is this whole situation was not handled appropriately and now I have two burgers I can't even eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson,3.08,3.08,2.996,,3.0800000000000005
2,Derek M.,"Glendale, CA",27,52,151.0,1.0,2017-12-05,"First and foremost I'm a huge fan of the brand. I've been a customer of RR for over 10 years. So much a fan that my family and friends typically get me a gift card for RR for the holidays or birthday. Sadly this has to be the worst RR I've been too.  Started out as soon as we walked in. They seemed extremely under staffed for lung time. We came in around 130 last Thursday. We were seated at one of the only clean table in the dining area. We counted 9 tables that hadn't been fully bused. Drink glasses everywhere. Ok, I get, slammed and short staffed. I work in the restaurant industry so I get it. We went ahead and ordered and I as always got the bottomless rootbeer floats. It's a bargain for 4.99. Tree the Blue Ribbon burger also with my bottomless fries crispy. That was the first time we saw our server. Didn't catch her name. Tattooed brunette. Well I was thirsty so the float lasted 2 minutes. Put my glass politely at the edge of the table to signal her. A runner or another server brought out our food. Our server didn't come back to see if we needed anything. We sat there for about 10 minutes waiting on someone to ask if we needed anything because we did. We needed a side of their chipotle mayo and a side of blue cheese dressing and I was in desperate need of something to drink, a refill on my route beer float. Our way to finally saw that we needed something as I politely called out to her across the dining room. I guess there were a couple of regulars and she was busy attending to them. Mind you no one has attended to the nine tables with dishes and drinks on them. She came up give us a look and we asked for the refill on the route beer float and the sides of dressing at which point she made no apology and just informed us there be a surcharge for the chipotle mayo. She brought the float back first. By the time she went to the kitchen and came back with the dressings I had already finished the second float and aspirate third. Both empty glasses remained at the table while she rushed to the bar and brought me a third glass. But now I had already finished my third float and my crispy fries were soggy from sitting around. I went ahead and ate them because I was starving. Another 15 or 20 minutes past and my fries were empty and I still had half of my burger left and yet another empty float. She came back after I had to call out to her once again. Asked for one more float and another order fries. The float came and added to the three empty glasses that I had. After she cleared the table the fries finally came out along with her pointing out that we can pay online. Not sure what the issue was, maybe they were just all having a bad day. But it's definitely not the Service and attitude I'm used to when I go to RR. Definitely won't be back to this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-henderson,2.92,3.06,2.984,,3.0040000000000004
