We ended up going just as it opened on Sunday after visiting Chocolate World (it was right down the street). The location is great and there are several restaurants, a Dunkies and the Tanger Outlets right in walking distance. It is your typical Red Robin. Busy, good prices, cute decor. Our waiter was very nice and attentive. My friend and I inhaled our food and even got the second free basket of fries. Yes, I am ashamed of this.

I've only ever been to one other Red Robin before and I couldn't remember if the food was good or not.  For the location, the Red Robin is a steal.  There's a Wendys nearby, but if you want something sit down, I think this is the closest place.  We were greeted and seated in a friendly and timely manner, our waitress (Amanda), was absolutely amazing.  She was nice, attentive and due to the food wait even gave us a free basket of fries.  She was also very knowledgable of the food, as 2 of us had either never been there, or hadn't been there in a very long time. The atmosphere is a bit cheezy, but gives you something to look at while you're waiting.   Overall it was pretty decent, I had the fish and chips, my friend had Baja Burger and my mom had some type of regular hamburger, all of which were absolutely amazing.  The only thing I didn't like was the side of macaroni and cheese I got, not htat it was bad, as my friend loved it, but it's very creamy and not my style that I like.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hershey?start=40,2.8920000000000003,2.8920000000000003,2.8920000000000003,2.8920000000000003,2.892000000000001

The food is not gourmet, but then again you shouldn't expect taht from a chain restaurant and it certainly is much better than your average Wendy's or McDonalds. The wait staff is usually right on the ball being friendly, and offering refills on endless fries and drinks. At times when they seem to be busier you may have a harder time getting them to get you extra stuff....We had wanted to purchase the seasoned salt that you place on the fries. We did end up having them add a bottle on for $3.00 but again at rush hour they are more just trying to move the flow in and out to get as many people as they can into seats.

It looked NOTHING like the picture on the menu. I might as well have gone to McDonalds for a double cheeseburger. Even worse, the Mac and Cheese was stone cold. That's right, they forgot to pop it in the microwave and actually melt the cheese. Let me tell you, cold Mac and Cheese is just plain gross! I called the manager over and he mumbled an apology and let me order something different. The fish and chips was at least cooked.

Although there were a number of bad reviews, we decided to take a chance since none of us wanted Wendy's and it's next to Tanger outlets. We were seated fairly quickly and the waitress came by a couple of times to see how we were doing. I got the mushroom burger and it came with endless fries. The burger and the fries were really good and it's just the right amount. We didn't need the endless fries since we were stuffed with the first. The best part of this restaurant has to be the bill. They have this machine where you can just swipe everything with a credit card and the receipt comes out. No need for the waitress at that point.

The only times I was dissatisfied was on separate occasions when I ordered a burger and the buns were soggy with either juice or grease i couldn't tell. This had happened to me 3 times so I feel that warrants knocking off a star. The chicken sandwiches are very good though. The fries are always -amazing- and seasoned to perfection. Try the (free) campfire dipping sauce and you'll be in heaven!! The appetizers are standard but I find myself loving the pretzel bites in the cheddar beer sauce. The wait staff I've encountered have always been helpful and very attentive. And on busy days the wait time is usually only about 30 min.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hershey?start=60,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.448,3.2000000000000006

First off, we are in town to celebrate my daughter's birthday weekend so I thought of bringing out the family to Red Robin for dinner. It was an overall terrible experience. We were seated rather quickly, in the back room. It took our server about 15 minutes to acknowledge us, once she finally came to us she was quite pleasant to work with but as we placed an order she informed us they were all out of their famous spinach dip. Then serving a much larger party that arrived after us with the dip that a few minutes ago we were told they were all out of. I asked for them to hold a birthday cake in the back, throw a candle on it and sing happy birthday to my 4 year old and was told to keep the cake on our table. Even after we hauled the cake all the way from NY. I will never give my patronage to this Red Robin ever again!  After a not so pleasant visit to the restaurant, I must say I am very impressed with their service response to said matter. I truly appreciate the General Manager of the store reaching out to me via phone, showing interest in my issue, and most importantly taking ownership of resolving any future issues.

The beef was okay but the mushrooms that were supposed to be sautéed in garlic were bland. Like they cut up a mushroom and fried it with no seasoning and put it on the burger.

Asked for burger to be made vegan, but it wasn't. When I asked for another they just changed out the bun and still had mayo on it. Definitely will go to other restaurants in the area from now on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hershey,2.36,2.78,2.78,,2.612
1,Kevin J.,"Belleville, NJ",14,27,65.0,1.0,2017-11-10,"One star is being extremely nice. Would NOT recommend coming here!! Place smells like dirty feet and the floor of the place is extremely dirty. We had to set our own table, and then we were told they ran out of plates for the fries. The waitress was not pleasant and extremely rushing when ordering our meal!! Never had to write a  bad review but this is the first!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hershey,2.24,2.76,2.76,,2.552
8,Guppie F.,"Outer Banks, NC",0,3,,1.0,2017-11-18,"Where do I start with this review? This is probably  one of the worst meals I have ever eaten and one star is pretty generous. To begin, we were served our food with dirty plates, no napkins nor any cutlery. Our waitress was probably one of the worst-very indifferent and inattentive. No thank you, never came to check to see if our food was ok and took over 1 hour to serve our food. When our food finally did arrive, the entire order was wrong. My friend and I had ordered the same burger. My burger had the first half of what was suppose to be on it and my friends had the other half. When I sent my burger back for a new one, they simply scraped off what wasn't supposed to be on it and gave it back. For these reason I will never be coming back to a Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hershey,2.24,2.73,2.73,,2.5340000000000003
6,Stephen S.,"Mechanicsburg, PA",0,1,,1.0,2017-12-15,They are right beside a very busy entertainment venue...   you would think they would know how to handle crowds. We called ahead to make a reservation and expected a short additional wait.  They would not tell us how much longer our wait would be. We were told we were next on the list but they called multiple other parties.  So after waiting 45 additional minutes we left.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hershey,2.16,2.7,2.7,,2.484
9,Jackie B.,"Quarryville, PA",0,1,,1.0,2017-12-30,"I wish I could give this experience less than a 1* but that is my only option. We go to the Red Robin in Lancaster, PA every so often and have never had an issue. We decided to stop by the one in Hershey before a Hershey Bears game. Knowing that it was a home game night, we knew that we may have been in for a wait but thought ourselves lucky when we were seated 12 mins into what they said would be a 30 min wait. Little did we know that was going to be the shortest wait we would have....after being seated it took 15 mins before anyone came over to take our drink order, in this time another table over in another section was seated shortly after us and had already received their drinks. Our section was starting to empty out but it took yet another 15 mins or so before our drinks showed up. My water with a lemon wedge showed up with something gross on it (it looked like uncooked hamburger). My husband's food did not arrive as ordered, even after the waitress had repeated the order back to him. Both of us substituted onion rings for fries and each got 4 of the smallest onion rings (you can get bottomless fries with your burger but if you substitute onion rings for $1.59 upcharge you get 4 small little things....). I was less than impressed with this visit. If asked if I would ever go back-that would be a big NO.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hershey,2.16,2.7,2.7,,2.484
0,Justin W.,"York, PA",3,243,1107.0,4.0,2018-01-03,A great Red Robin. The service was prompt and the waitress was helpful and didn't charge for the games I played (word of caution games are not free and they don't tell you this)The turkey burger was decent but I've had better. The main attraction here is the fries. Never skip out on the fries; they are top 5 I've eaten. I even got more (fries are truly bottomless),https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hershey,2.28,2.7,2.7,,2.532
