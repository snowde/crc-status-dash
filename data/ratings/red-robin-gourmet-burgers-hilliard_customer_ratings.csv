51,Remard C.,"Dublin, OH",9,19,,4.0,2012-04-24,"Red Robin is great restaurant for families. It's very kid oriented and they also have very good food.  I love their fried mushrooms and they are known for their burgers.  My favorite is the basic bacon cheeseburger.  You also get bottomless fries with the burgers. They have plenty of good options on the kids menu and have balloons for the kiddies when you leave. A solid burger joint for those with, or without, kids.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hilliard?start=40,3.216,3.216,3.216,3.216,3.2160000000000006

36,Shawn M.,"Columbus, OH",36,133,36.0,3.0,2012-08-14,"This place is good, the reason i rated it a 3 is the prices seem high for burgers. You do get unlimited fries which is kinda cool.  There is nothing to special about Red Robin that makes the prices worth the food. I mean a burger is a burger, minus fast food joints. But for a burger fries and drink to run you $10+ is kinda mind boggling. Its not like they use secret ingredients.  If you want a expensive burger this is the place to go. You can get the same quality at Steak n Shake, Applebees, etc, which a number of them will resemble Red Robins prices.

Even if this is a chain, I really enjoy their burgers.  I have only been disappointed once with coming here dozens of times.  The place is great for kids and now that I have a little one, I feel a little more normal here.  Their burgers can be a little expensive especially if you don't make use of their unlimited steak fries.   Last time here, I ordered the Banzai Burger with Pineapple and a teriyaki sauce.  I really enjoyed this burger as it was think and juicy with a wonderful flavor.  I would utilize the option to change the bun on the burger along with the order.  I ordered it on a jalapeno onion bun.  I also ordered it with southwest black beans instead of the fries, so i would say I spent a little too much but I had a gift card so I wasn't too worried.  I would order the Banzai, Royal Red Robin, the burger with Guac, or the whiskey burger and be happy here.  They have a good amount of choices and do pretty well with making a nice looking burger.  Once I did get sick from eating here, but that was many years ago.  I avoided the place for awhile but my free burger along with my wife's love of this place brought us back.

I've been to Red Robin a handful of times, usually for their Turkey Burger and bottomless steak fries.  Yes, I love me some steak fries.  At this Red Robin, I was undecided and I know they are known for their burgers.  I held off a burger because I was having Bachi in a couple of days.  The waitress arrived and I was still undecided.  I freaked out with the pressure of being undecided that I ended up choosing their Nantucket Seafood Scatter.  This consisted of battered cod, fried shrimp, clam strips, and fries.  The food was okay, but to be honest I couldn't tell the difference between the cod, fried shrimp, and clam strips. Everything was covered in batter that it was just that what I tasted could remember, just the batter.  The fries were good like always and they are endless.   When it comes to a Red Robin, there's something for everyone.  Everyone that loves bad for you food that is.  Next time, if there's a next time, I'm at Red Robin I'm going to stick to what I know is good and okay for you...their Turkey Burger.   PS:  Their chili is back on the menu.  Been a long time, but it's some of the best chili you'll find out there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hilliard?start=20,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003

52,Erin W.,"Hilliard, OH",3,13,,1.0,2015-10-24,"We have been severely disappointed the last couple times we've been to Red Robin. We used to enjoy this restaurant because the food was good, it was reasonably priced, and it didn't take a long time. Now that we have a toddler, the length of time it takes to get food becomes even more important. My husband was so annoyed at the wait to take our order that he started a timer- I think it was over 26 minutes by the time we got our order in.  We also had issues with the machine on the table- the buttons are misleading so that while thinking I was playing a free trivia game (after all, I did not select ""$1.99 play as many games as you want"" as you want) I accepted charges without being aware of it (the ""cancel"" option is actually where the price seemed to be listed, upon further inspection after receiving a higher than expected bill). Perhaps it's technically my fault for not reading the fine print but no one likes to leave an establishment feeling like they've been taken advantage of. This really should be unacceptable anyway, especially with these devices within the reach of children and, to my observation, most frequently used by them. I was also disappointed to find that instead of taking my more expensive birthday burger off the bill, the billing system removed my husband's less expensive option. Ever since we started patronizing Red Robin they always took the more expensive burger off, regardless of who ordered it, and brought a little birthday sundae at the end of the meal. However, I can understand that this policy might have changed but the other two issues are frankly not forgivable. All of this is on top of previous visits with similar (or longer) wait times at the table and even worse, a waitress who lost our credit card when we tried to pay (which added another 50 minutes to our stay while she walked around aimlessly with absolutely no confidence that she was even looking for it, let alone had notified her manager and asked for assistance from team members). We will not be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hilliard?start=40,3.04,3.04,3.04,2.308,3.0400000000000005
22,Corey S.,"Hilliard, OH",19,53,14.0,2.0,2015-10-26,"This is a difficult review to write. My rating has changed over time from very good to below expectations. The complaints that I have now are mostly situational related to our local restaurant and perhaps not indicative of the experience you will have at a different location.  Let me start with the good: we have always been happy with the menu and the food. My wife gets a salad with lite dressing, I substitute sweet potato fries. I like the turkey burger, my wife usually likes one of their fancy options and often customizes. The fare is simple, but has always been prepared well and we often look forward to what we are getting. Put simply, the food is good. The bad part is the management of the restaurant and the service. A few years back, we would go at least once a month because we always got seated quickly and the service was fast, friendly, and efficient. Lately, they've gone completely down-hill. Over the last three visits we have had consistent problems 1) getting seated quickly, 2) getting a server to acknowledge us in a reasonable time after being seated, and 3) getting our food to our table in a time frame comparable to previous experiences.  The first of our last three visits, I had to flag down the manager after 10 minutes sitting at our table without a server. She dealt with it well, but it made the whole experience not enjoyable. The second of our last three visits, our service was slow and then we had to wait an extra 15-20 minutes at the end to get our check dealt with because our server lost my credit card. It took half that time for the manager to acknowledge that there was a problem and she made no effort to push to a resolution, instead leaving quickly to go back and expedite orders. Eventually, another server found my card and the manager decided to comp our meal, but it was a complete customer service disaster. This most recent visit, we waited between 5-10 minutes after being seated to be acknowledged by our server. I meant to time the whole visit but forgot until I got frustrated with the delay. I did start the time late when our server finally acknowledged us and from then until the time our food hit the table it took 42 minutes. That is not an acceptable wait for this type of restaurant. To top everything off, they have switched to using the Ziosk devices on the table now. My wife noticed they had trivia on it and so she started playing. It wasn't until we were reviewing the bill that we realized that the stupid thing charged us $2.00 for the short time we spent playing trivia. It does tell you it is going to charge money, but the workflow is very misleading and easy to mess up. If you have a kid or a toddler, keep them completely away from the stupid thing unless you want to pay the extra money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hilliard?start=20,2.96,2.96,2.96,2.408,2.96

17,Jay P.,"Hilliard, OH",26,92,1.0,2.0,2016-04-13,"Got home last night and the first thing my wife says is ""I want a burger for dinner"" Not Hello Honey or How was your day? This told me she had been through a long day and needed some comfort food. We talked about going to a few other places but quickly settled on Red Robin, as we had always had a decent experience there. We walked in and were seated right away in the bar area, which was fine. Our waitress appeared after a minute or two, with a trainee in tow. She took our drinks order and then was soon back to take our food order. My wife had a basic burger with fries and I ordered the Guacamole & Bacon Burger, also with fries. We had not been to a Red Robin for about 6-9 months and noticed they now had these tablets sitting on the table. They are loaded with games, information and more. Before we received our food, our waitress came bye and explained how to use the tablet in full. Not only does it let you play games, but it also let's you sign up for their birthday club, will allow you to pay for your meal if using a credit card and most importantly, will let you leave feedback on your dining experience. Our waitress told us about this particular feature 3 different times during our visit, requesting we give her a ""10"" rating each time.  When our food arrived, my wife's burger was fine, but mine was missing the guacamole. We asked a passing manager why the guacamole and bacon burger had no quac and he was  shocked but quickly went back into the kitchen to get some. Of course, even though he was quick, the burger was now growing cold, as was our feelings about the feedback we were going to leave. We've eaten at this same restaurant about 3 times now and until this meal, never really had any complaints, but we also were never blown away by any of the food. Between the multiple requests for a great rating from our waitress and the burger without guacamole, it will probably be a while before we go back. it used to be that a wait staff would be tipped well if they provided great service, but last night we wondered if being given a good review was more important? My advice to Red Robin, take away the tablets, take away the server reviews and let the wait staff worry about the customers, not their ratings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hilliard,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005

The saddest part is that this chain didn't really start it's decline until the past few years. There was a time Red Robin was known for decent burgers.  The fries are just totally crappy, lifeless, and usually luke warm (if you're lucky).  I came here for a juicy, hot, cheesy, mind blowing burger, but I have so viciously fooled myself into thinking that this chain produced such quality, and I was left with complete and utter buyers regret, considering the amazing places we have here in Ohio for some beef.  Hell, just drive a few minutes up Trabue Rd to Johnnie's for some REAL meat.  I want my $50 back.  The dessert sucks, too. Don't bother....

I went through the whole process and at the end of it, it forces you to enter a credit card to finish. I wanted to pay with cash, so I called it in. I told the woman on the phone (who was friendly) about the 20% off and she said they would take it off when I arrive and pay. When I get there, they send me to the bar to get my order. The bartender is obviously busy and I wait for a few minutes. When he gets to me, I tell him I have a take out order and that I want to use a coupon. He disregarded that and rang it up at normal price. I showed him the coupon on their website and he said that's only for people who have some kind of rewards card or something. I responded that it says nothing about that and it's just 20% off a take out order. He gets frustrated and has to get someone else, so I wait. When the next guy comes, he says he knows nothing about the coupon and didn't want to honor it, but after my persistence he finally re-rang it, but wouldn't take my money, so I waited some more. The bartender comes back to take my money. I hand him a large bill to which he says ""If you want to pay with that, you'll have to give me some time because I don't have change.""
