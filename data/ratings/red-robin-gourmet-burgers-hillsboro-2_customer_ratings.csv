The burgers we got we not good at all.  I got whiskey BBQ - the onions we not good at all, the lettuce was stale.  3.99 for lemonade, why?

Two of us can share one easily. I feel their prices are a little on the hefty side though. I don't eat hamburgers anymore but there is still a variety of other things to try. The atmosphere is quite kid friendly I think. They sing their own rendition of Happy Birthday.  Our server, this visit, was pleasant enough but took quite a while to come back and check on us. I was ready for my fries pretty quickly because the Prime Rib french dip was lacking. He would have noticed that if he came by. It was loaded with fat (which I removed before eating) and tasteless.

I usually come here with a couple of my coworkers. I always get the Whiskey River BBQ Burger which is topped with *swoon* crispy onion straws. Additionally, you pretty much have to get their fries.

Ranch is my classic favorite, but I had a Thai Chili sauce that was delicious, and I will definitely get it again. Some of the new ""fancier"" sauces have a small fee, but they give you a large portion to make up for the added charge.  Red Robin keeps it simple with ""a little pink"" or ""no pink"" as your burger options.

56,Linda C.,"Beaverton, OR",61,285,21.0,3.0,2014-05-31,"What is with all the Red Robins and their subpar service? The servers are nice and friendly. Every one of them. I feel like they're flaky though. All of them. At least in all of my experiences at all of the Red Robins I have been to in the last year or two.  I write of this particular one because my experience here has made me come to the conclusion that the customer service sucks all around and I hate to say that because once upon a time, I really did enjoy coming to Red Robin. We were a party of four, here for dinner after a movie. Mom-in-law offered to pay for dinner since we paid for the movies. I asked for a booth where we can watch the Spurs game. So far so good, we got a good seat. Our server was nice and friendly. We ordered our drinks. They were served quickly and we even got our strawberry lemonades refilled quickly and without having to ask. Bonus points because this was a first for us. At this point, I'm thinking ""Awesome, could it be that we finally found a Red Robin that's on point?"" And then it south from there. When the food finally arrives, I don't get my roasted green chile dip and one of the strawberry lemonades needs to be refilled.  When asked if there was anything else she could bring us (she wasn't our server), I said ""Napkins, please. I also ordered a roasted green chile dip. Not honey mustard.""  ""Oh, I'll bring it out,"" she replies.  You can probably guess what happened next. She never came back. Our server came back but go figure that it was when my mouth was full and she didn't stick around long enough for me to force it down. The strawberry lemonade didn't get refilled either. She went MIA after that. We could hear her but we didn't see her.  We flagged down another server instead to ask for more fries. Several minutes past, my meal is nearly done and our server appears to check on us again.  She swoops to take our kiddo's plate off the table but I stop her. ""He's waiting for fries,"" I tell her. ""Oh, I'll get that started,"" she says ever so helpful.  ""I put the order in for you already,"" the other server shouts from over the wall where the drink station is.  ""I'll go check on it,"" she says brightly.  Several minutes go by, fries were super fried.  He didn't even finish it and this growing boy loves his fries.  When we get the check, she quickly took care of the discrepancy we found on the bill. (Took off the roasted green chile dip that I never got) It was smooth sailing thereafter. We finished in time to watch the Spurs beat the Thunders in OT for the Western Conference Finals. The meal itself was okay. Mom-in-law devoured her burger.  She really enjoyed the DGB.  The strawberry lemonades are delicious. The staff is nice but need more focus and how about some follow through. The food is consistent however after this time, I don't think even the bottomless steak fries will tempt me back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hillsboro-2?start=60,3.12,3.12,3.12,2.444,3.1200000000000006

They do simple things for their customers to make dining out easier. For young kids, bendy straws so when they are sitting, they don't tip their cups over. Since finding out my son has a gluten allergy back a few years ago, we've had to find options to go out to eat. RR has been at the forefront to be sensitive to allergen customers. They have gluten free buns and will cook fries in a separate fryer that haven't touched breaded foods. We never asked them to do this, they just did their homework and made this adjustment for all the many allergic people of the world. I am happy that not putting silverware at the table makes it better to not have to wash unused silverware over and over just for using the napkins. One thing I would like to see is the servers bring lots of napkins every time. We usually have to ask and remind to get some.

150,Kelsey B.,"Portland, OR",47,30,2.0,1.0,2015-05-22,"Absolutely terrible food and service.  My friend and I went out to dinner here last weekend, and it didn't even start off on a good note. It took our waitress so long to show up and ask us what we wanted to drink that we ended up placing our entire order because we weren't sure she'd ever come back. I got the Absolutely Absolut lemonade, which was definitely not as cold as it should have been and the strawberries didn't seem ripe enough, which made the entire drink taste really bitter.  We ordered the pretzel bites, which showed up with almost NO salt (making them super bland), and the cheese dipping was watery and disgusting.  My friend ordered the Seafood Scatter and I got a patty melt. Despite ordering my patty melt plain, it showed up with onions all over it. Both of our meals were cold, his fish was hard as a rock and not at all fresh, and the bread on my patty melt was basically burned and the meat was way overcooked.  We sent the food back and when they finally brought us more, it was obvious they'd taken the shrimp off of my friend's first plate and tossed it on the new one, because it was still hard and cold. As for my new patty melt, the bread was still almost burned, meat was overcooked, and to top things off, it had a really strange odor to it that caused me to give up a few bites in.  When the waitress finally brought us our check, we were informed that we'd been given the pretzel bites for free to make up for the trouble. However, considering the fries were the only edible thing we were served, it was really just too little, too late.  Wouldn't go back unless someone paid me a lot of money to suffer through their terrible food again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hillsboro-2?start=40,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.6600000000000006,2.48

62,D H.,"Downtown, Portland, OR",1,13,6.0,1.0,2015-09-07,"Red Robin used to be a great place place.  I frequently took the family for good meals at good prices with good service.  Not anymore. They recently remodeled their image inside and outside, but what came along with it is a remodeled management mentality which in my opinion is not in favor of the customer.  The focus now is on how fast they can turn tables, and how much they can get away with on price increases & portion size decreases.  The last four times I dined here, I had to ask for refills on the 'bottomless fries' and drinks, the wait staff never offered.  (Asking me ""How's everything tasting?"" does not suffice - I should not have to ask for refills I should be ASKED if I want refills.)  A bit about the food quality decline over the past half year:  Twice the kid's corn dogs were not cooked all the way, they still had wet uncooked dough and a cold hot dog inside.  Once child's portion of pasta arrived with 10 (yes, count 'em, TEN) noodles and about a tablespoon of red sauce. We never ordered that again.  In general, I can get far better $10-12+ burgers in terms of taste, size, value, and service at any number of places nearby, and they'll come served ON A PLATE, not in a cheap basket or plastic tray wrapped in a paper wrapper.  And twice, the patty melts, ordered ""no pink"" arrived raw inside, and they are now about 2/3 the size they were a year ago.  By the way, patty melts have been around for about a hundred years & the standard recipe across the country is for them to contain Swiss cheese (so why do Red Robin patty melts arrive with American cheese if I forget to tell the waiter to make sure there is Swiss cheese in it?). And a patty melt is supposed to be grilled & toasty-crisp on the outside of the grilled rye bread, not soggy wet on the bottom side.  I then have to choose to eat what is delivered, or wait for 10 minutes for the waiter to return to ask everyone but me at the table ""How's everything tasting, awesome?"" and then disappearing before anyone has a chance to clear the bite of food from their mouths to form a reply.  Then there's the prices overall, which are inflated to compensate for the overdone bar scene remodeling & the next thing, which I will refer to as ""the final straw.""  The final straw is that they have recently deployed obnoxious ""Ziosk"" touchscreen devices at all the tables.  They claim these things are to improve the customer experience, but based on  the research I did on them, they are really designed to do 3 things: reduce the waitstaff/customer interaction time, turn tables faster & get your kids to nag you to pay for video games (precisely the first thing my kid's discovered and promptly engaged with.)  Now, this may be an outdated concept, but I take my family out for a meal to enjoy time interacting with my family, eat good food, and get good service.  That Ziosk thing, on the other hand, takes up space on the table, reduces the quality of the family time, and does nothing to improve the food or the service.  I expressed to the waitress my dissatisfaction about having to use it, and the waitress assured me I did not need to use it.  Then she proceeded to figure out how enter out drink orders on it right in front of us.  When it soon came time to pay for the meal, I handed my rewards card & credit card to the waitress & again stated I did not want to use the Ziosk device.  She instead dismissed me with some comments to the effect of how easy and fun it is, and instructed me how to navigate the menu & swipe my rewards card and my credit card into the beast, which promptly and conveniently presented a tip suggestion of 20%.  Then she hovered about the table as if waiting to see what I'd do for the tip.  To sum it up, if this is the new Red Robin, it is no longer a place I want to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hillsboro-2?start=100,2.8,2.8,2.8,2.5960000000000005,2.8

141,Nathan S.,"Portland, OR",106,180,39.0,3.0,2015-11-05,"Oh conflicting feelings! There was a time when I would have rated Red Robin 5 stars...but maybe that's because I was youthful and loved any kind of burger and all-you-can-eat fries I could find. Red Robin for me is a place of fun and nostalgia. I will always have a sense of loyalty to this place, as I've enjoyed many birthday celebrations, post-event desserts, dates, and hangouts at this 'other happiest place on earth.' However, recently, I've been a bit disappointed with the direction Red Robin is going. Before I get into my concerns, however, let me highlight the positives: 1) They have the best chicken strips I've ever had. I once tried every burger on the menu, but now I almost exclusively order their chicken strips. They are so cripsy, yet shatter and dissolve in your mouth as you bite into them. It's a sensation you just can't experience anywhere else. 2) The Red Robin seasoning salt! It's a must on all fries 3) Their sweet and spicy ketchup! and their campfire sauce! I usually try 4-5 different sauces whenever I go Concerns:  Ok, so in the last couple of years, RR seems to be making some changes to they way they do things. They no longer serve baskets of fries with their meals (they still use baskets when they bring out additional orders of bottomless). Now they stack their fries in a fancy chrome cup thing. It's supposed to look nicer, but I'm on to your game, RR...you're just serving out fewer fries. The portion isn't perceived to be decreased since it's all stacked up nicely in the small chrome cup. Just give me back that basket of fries you used to bring out. Also, biggest beef I have with Red Robin is that they no longer wrap their burgers when they serve them to you. They now come out on 'fancy' plates without any wrapper. The problem is that their burgers are not the easiest to eat, and now my burgers always fall apart half-way through eating them. I would love for them to sacrifice their 'new look' to go back to convenience and comfort and wrap their burgers again, and serve them in the basket of fries!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hillsboro-2?start=40,3.04,3.04,3.04,2.7640000000000002,3.0400000000000005

There are a few waiters / waitresses that are excellent at their jobs and it's always a pleasure when one of them is taking care of you. Sometimes it can be difficult to get additional fries for the bottomless fries in a timely manner. Also, it seems a little counter intuitive that a bigger portion is brought for the refill than the original. It's not my favorite option, but when I want to go someplace that is more of a sit down feel than normal, this fits the bill. They have started to put screens on each table that you can play trivia and pay your bill on.

A manager walked the dining room occasionally, checking in on the customers and servers instead of staying out of sight. The only downsides are: (1) it's a bit on the pricey side, and (2) the electronic payment tablet on every table. Don't misunderstand; I do like having those tablets at the table. It means I can pay when I'm ready, instead of handing off my card to get yet another lengthy receipt that I have to do math on. It emailed me the receipt instantly.

Today's experience was probably the last straw.  We went in and were sat down pretty quickly.  You ever sit at a table and feel like the waitresses dont know who's responsible for the table?  That was tonight.  It took 10 minutes to get just drinks.  Okay they were what I would define as mildly busy, but in general the waitress seemed to just be going through the motions.  Got our waters pretty quickly. Another 15 minutes had gone buy and the waitress had still not come to take our food order.  She finally walks over and we place our order.  About 5 minutes later the table next to us places their order.   20 minutes later the food came out for the table next to us.  Then about 5 minutes later our food came out.  The person who must have been a manager who dropped off our food asked if we needed something.  I asked for BBQ sauce.  After about 5 minutes with the way things had gone I figured it was not coming so just ate.  Sure enough by the time I finished no BBQ sauce. Wife's salad was warm, my burger was only warm, and fries were on the cold side. We got one final ""do you want any more fries"" and I didnt want to wait any longer so I said no.  Within 3 minutes we were brought our check. Heres the best part - we didnt even have to pay with the waitress.  If you havent been there in a while the stands with the screens where you can order your appetizers, desserts, etc, well that was more of a waitress today than the actual waitress.  She brought water, someone else brought food, and alas, a very poor experience. For not even being the best burger in town (see: Helvetia Tavern, Cruise-in country diner) you are losing out on the only thing you have going for you, and thats an experience and customer service.  Will likely never return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hillsboro-2?start=20,3.12,3.03,3.03,2.18,3.066

We were given a gift card by a family member and us d it for a nice dinner and movie night out. But that's about where the nice stops. I even waited a few days to make sure I wanted to say something about our experience and what I wanted to say.  Our waiter from the start was condescending and rude. when we asked it'd it was open seating in the bar,  he said yeah and rolled his eyes.  We asked for a few moments before ordering because we weren't sure what we wanted right when we sat down.

We ordered, thinking maybe it was just a one off thing, and it was loud in the restaurant and we had to ask him to repeat a few things and each time his tone was terrible. I really don't know why we stayed except that we were both really hungry and this gift card had to be used sometime.  We asked for fries while we waited and our waiter walked away. Flash to 20 minutes later to no fries, no food, no water, but he made sure our bar drinks were delivered. Every time we saw him he was talking to other staff members or leaning against the counter. Our food finally came, and we asked the person who brought the food for more fries because we had about 5 on the plate. She was very nice and said she would let our server know. We ate our food (don't even consider the French onion soup) and were looking out for the fries. No fries, and no waiter, and still no water.

Then being pretty fed up at having to ask a fourth time for some help, one of us went to the host stand to talk to a manager about what was happening. Suddenly fries appeared, and the ""manager"" bearing a free $3-5 appetizer coupon, saying this is for ""when things like this happen."" Pretty much the rock bottom minimum.

There are few restaurants who go out of their way to accommodate guests whims, Red Robin does it exceptionally!  Paleo or gluten free? Order your burger lettuce wrapped and order unlimited steamed broccoli or side salad!  You can swap out toppings and cheese. Love that the kids meals around $5 each come with drinks (I hate paying for kids drinks) and unlimited fries.  Hint: order a free basket of fries as your appetizer!  Free campfire sauce is amazing!

My burger, which was ordered off the GF menu came with deep fried jalapeño coins which are not GF. They were quick to correct with a new burger.  My big complaint about their GF bun, this is not unique to RR, is that the GF bun was significantly smaller than the burger patty making it hard to eat the burger. They also charge $1 for the GF bun. This seems to be a trend at many restaurants. Chick-fil-a across the street also charges an extra dollar.  They have a second deep fryer for French fries only so there is no cross contamination with the breaded deep fried foods.

We sat in the waiting area for maybe 10 minutes. They brought us a small side of fries to apologize for the long wait. That was not necessary but much appreciated as we had a 1 year old getting restless. After we got our food we were happy this time with the quantity of fries and extra ranches. Everything was as expected and tasted great.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hillsboro-2,2.52,2.91,2.91,,2.7540000000000004

Pro: -They make a solid burger. -Bottomless fries (be sure to get the dipping sauces.  They're great!). -Consistent quality. Cons: -Long wait to get seated... But hey, it was busy... You can't really hold that against a business. -Slow service.  I'm not sure if someone (or multiple people) called in sick... But it took forever to get served.  Even after being served, our party of 6 barely got checked up on... And even then, it took ages to get anything. -We got charged for using their tablet entertained... Even though we didn't use it.... Fighting over a $1.99 fee wasn't worth the hassle, so just paid it. All in all... I would recommend RR... Just not this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hillsboro-2,2.68,2.9,2.9,,2.8120000000000003

Then she -Kaori-left for a while and other customers were waiting around to get seated and the entire front area was full. This generation of workers are clueless on customer service and need to be trained.  The floor was so gross I was slipping and it wasn't the rain.

39,William J.,"Hillsboro, OR",0,63,6.0,2.0,2017-10-12,"Well, just like the Outback Steakhouse this place has gone downhill. The food isn't necessarily worse but the staff and how the place is managed is unprofessional, slow and they make a lot of mistakes with orders. We sat at the bar for about 1 hour because the dining room was just in chaos. We watched as people came in for their to-go orders and saw one guy have to return his order twice to get it right. Not uncommon to see most orders returned at least once. They're not afraid to charge a lot of money for food. Service from the kitchen is very slow so don't come in if you need a timely meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hillsboro-2,2.6,2.9,2.9,,2.7800000000000002
23,Jesse G.,"Hillsboro, OR",9,50,28.0,2.0,2017-10-23,"Honestly...Red Robin isn't my 1st, or even 6th choice as a alternative dining location. I have had multiple unsatisfactory visits. Tonight this decision was made for me so i figured the heck. Sadly, the result was the same. We had a party of 6. For starters, it took close to 35 minutes for us to get our food. Our server made several excuses during our visit. She didn't pay attention to our party as she should have, got several of our requests wrong, and clearly didn't put our order in a reasonable time. I don't like it when people make excuses when their people they are trying to help don't want to hear it.  Anyway on to the food. We ordered a kids pizza with sausage (no cheese) for my son who is lactose intolerant. ""Interesting Choice"" our server said. Of course it was served with cheese..My wife got a Burning Love burger. Requested medium rare and came not close to that. Also there were supposed to be fried jalapenos and there were just fried nuggets. I got the Smokey Pepper burger...not to Smokey and not too peppery. Thankfully it was served medium rare as i ordered, but there were just two sad pieces of bacon (not peppered as advertised)  Anyway the store manager did come over and acknowledge all of the missteps. Not sure what the final resolution was seeing as i had to leave early to take my son home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hillsboro-2,2.6,2.89,2.89,,2.774
36,Melanie C.,"Beaverton, OR",0,17,,2.0,2017-11-04,"I really don't get what's happened to this place. Red Robin as a brand is great but the Tanasbourne location seriously stinks. We have given the place at least 10 chances. We live nearby but won't be back again. We will go into Beaverton instead. Short story: greasy old stale fries, lemonade passing as margaritas, dirty tables, silverware and spotty service.

22,Edward R.,"Beaverton, OR",1,5,,1.0,2017-11-21,"First of all let me say that I am definitely not one to review nor am I one to complain but this has definitely caused some frustration.  For the last 10 years I have always thrown a Christmas party for my employees. This year we chose to go to Red Robin near Hillsboro as we typically go to the one near Mall 205 in pdx. I called two locations, the one on TV highway and the one near 185th letting them know that I would like to host my Christmas party there, I do not need a banquet room I just need to make sure they have enough tables and chairs for my employees to have a good time. I also let them know that I would be putting this on my corporate credit card and that this tab ranges anywhere between $1000-$2000 for this type of event. (They will not make that much money in 1.5 any other way). The first location I called which was the TV highway location gave me a definite no and told me that they were not able to accommodate my request. ONE MONTH IN ADVANCE!! I did express to that manager (Sherri) that that seemed to be poor business and that I could not understand how any business with decline this amount of customers and a paid tab. I asked to speak to her manager. I left my number for a call back.  I then called the location on 188th and asked to speak with the manager Julie unfortunately Julie was not available as she is on vacation so I ended up speaking with the gentleman who was the manager of the kitchen named Pallino. Pallino told me the same thing Sherri from the other location told me and that was that they were not able to accommodate my request because of the hours indicated 5:30pm. I then asked to speak with his general manager and that is when he told me her name was Leanne stein. I called Leanne and left a detailed message and asked for a call back. I revived a calla round 40 mins later from Leanne.  So here it goes.... I cannot express enough the amount of unprofessionalism and lack of customer service that I have received from the general manager Leanne Stein. I am appalled that this restaurant would decline a party of 30 people because it was during their peek hours even though I called to to inform them a month in advance that I would be bring my staff to this location on 12/22/17 arriving at 5:30pm and would be done within 1.5hrs.  I was told they will not accommodate me and my employees as they will loose money on a number of tables that are not able to be turned over because of my large party. She tried to break it down to me in a way that felt was very condescending and not needed, she stated she would need six tables in order to accommodate my party and that's too many to lose money on. She said around 3 years ago they used to take larger parties but those larger parties would stay at the restaurant for way too long and they were not able to make the revenue that they would if they would just stop accommodating large parties. I felt like this is VERY poor business and I am not able to comprehend her reasoning from a business standpoint. There is no way that they are going to make in between $1000 and $2000 within an hour and a half no matter how many people they see. This is guaranteed payment!!! I asked if I could speak with her manager she said she did not have one I asked her where the corporate office was located she told me Denver Colorado she also told me that I could escalate this as far as I want but it will end up back on her desk as she is the regional general manager for this area. Her uncalled for comment about escalating this issue is why I am writing this review because I felt she was unprofessional and felt as if she felt she was the ""Person in charge"" of customer issues or complaints which I know is not the case.  I feel she should have done something to accommodate my large party and since I am not getting a call back from the corporate office I decided the only way for my concern to be seen is to leave a review on each location.

25,Nell S.,"Beaverton, OR",0,37,,1.0,2018-01-06,"Until now, I've never had a bad experience at a Red Robin. I'll never go back to this particular one. My partner and I sat in the bar, and while it took a long time for the server to get our order, that was no big deal. I had the Caesar salad and my partner had one of the fancy burgers. Or, I should say...those are what we ordered. To say we had them would imply that we ate them beyond a few bites. The server explained that they were out of romaine and could make the Caesar with iceberg lettuce, and I said sure, not a big deal. An abnormal amount of time later, the server brought dinner. My partner's fries were lukewarm (normally RR fries are too hot to handle when first served), and her burger was chilly. As for mine, I had a bowl of limp, flat, warm, browning iceberg lettuce with a particularly bland dressing and some strips of medium warm chicken. Even adding more dressing didn't seem to add flavor. The 'toast' was in one case soggy, and in the other felt stale--neither piece was warm. My partner figured the stuff had sat under the heat lamp for a very long time; she may have been right. We aren't the type to be cruel to servers, but after picking at these disappointments for a few moments, we agreed we just didn't want to eat this. We told the server. He made the standard offers of restitution you'd expect of a capable waiter, and we opted to leave without finishing or paying. I don't think this was all his fault, though you'd think he'd notice a bed of browning, badly cut lettuce. Then the most disappointing thing happened, the one that showed us where the rot began. My partner asked to speak to the manager. You can tell when a manager is concerned, because s/he wants to have the conversation. This one did not. Oh, he apologized, but he didn't ask for any details; he seemed willing to hear out whatever we said, apologize however many times it took, but that was it. ""Wanna gift card?"" he asked, as if he gets such complaints a couple times an hour and is used to them. No, thanks, said my partner. I don't know what's wrong with this RR, but I have a pretty good idea it stems from lack of leadership. Now I'm not absolutely sure we feel comfortable visiting any others. If we want to spend that much for a hamburger, we can get much better ones in a much less obnoxious setting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hillsboro-2,2.28,2.67,2.67,,2.5140000000000002
