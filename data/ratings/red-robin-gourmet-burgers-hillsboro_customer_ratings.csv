64,Chris W.,"Cornelius, OR",6,81,1.0,3.0,2012-01-23,I have and will continue to go here but the place is nothing more then A-OK. The establishment is what is found in any of their other Red Robins found anywhere. Its a cookie cutter place with the food following step for step. Some of it is good but its almost all meh.  The prices are OK and I usually find myself going here when they have a great deal going on. I would tend to stay away from most of their appetizers. The burgers are good I like some of their options including the whiskey river burger.  I can't say this is my first option when it comes to restaurants but its an option late nights and the staff here works hard and is pleasant enough.  I think most people would rate this place as a 2-4 star place depending on their experience but it has never been a black and white place its neither horrible or amazing. It just is.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hillsboro?start=80,2.636,2.636,2.636,2.636,2.636

63,Brian I.,"West Linn, OR",62,256,33.0,3.0,2012-06-26,"I hesitantly checked into Red Robin via the Yelp smartphone app when we were here 2 weeks back, instantly knowing I'd regret it.  You see, I'm not one to ignore Yelp's little reminder that you need to review a restaurant that you checked into.  Yes, you can kill the little reminder, but the OCD portion of my brain won't allow me to do that.  Maybe some combination of therapy and chemicals can help me...?  On a similar note, I intentionally avoided checking into Red Lobster last night for that very same reason.  HAH, I shall foil you yet, Yelp check-in-reminder. So, as the eloquent Bob M. put it, ""what were we doing in here?  Getting a fine burger and good fries.""  Yep, same.  I wanted to try the ""Tavern Double"" I'd seen advertised recently, because I'm a good, traditional American consumer.  I typically avoid RR's burgers because I don't think they're impressive in any way, shape or form.  I will admit that the Tavern Double was fine; even better than their standard burger offerings, I dare to say.  I like Red's steak fries.  I do NOT recommend their ""Three-for-all"", which is the aforementioned steak fries, onion straws and sweet potato fries.  It's not necessary to get fancy, just stick with the tried and true steak fries.  Back to the burger: 2 smallish patties, cheese, lettuce, tomato and thousand island.  That's really it.  I think it's Red's ode to an In-N-Out double double.  You know what, it works.  It's fine.  It's not in the same league as a double double or a Rachel's double, but if you're trapped at Red Robin via gunpoint, it's a good burger choice. *Cue the Debbie Downer music* Three-For-All appetizer: 2,764 mg of sodium Red's Tavern Double: 1,086 mg of sodium That's just the sodium.  No, I didn't come close to eating even half of the appetizer, but still, I'm confident I pushed the 2k barrier for salt.  YUCK.  On top of that, I noticed that their seasoning (in those nifty jumbo dispensers at each table) contain MSG.  Don't let their website fool you: anything that says ""hydrolyzed protein"" IS, in fact, a variation on MSG.  So, is this an indictment of Red Robin?  No, not at all.  RR is FINE, in moderation.  For me, in this case, ""moderation"" = 2x a year, at the most.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hillsboro?start=80,2.476,2.476,2.476,2.476,2.476

74,Astra N.,"Hillsboro, OR",3,43,,1.0,2012-07-16,"Alas, the time has come and gone when the original Red Robin in Seattle served some of the best burgers around. What's left since the original owner sold out so many years ago is a pale shadow of who they were.  This was never more apparent than from my visit the other day. I ordered a Crispy Chicken Sandwich.  This is something I'd been doing for a while here, and while the service has gone steadily downhill for some years now, I was still a fan of that sandwich.   Ten minutes went to fifteen; I asked the waitress twice what was going on.  She told me (three times, actually) that my order was 'coming up shortly'.   At the twenty-minute mark, I asked to see the manager.  He confessed that my order had been lost; then screwed-up by one of the seeming legions of new employees which come through their revolving door on a monthly basis.  He said it would be out 'really soon'. At the thirty minute mark, I asked to see him again.  He apologized, then told me that my meal would be 'free', and that the re-make 'looked like a hockey puck'. I said, ""You don't know me, and I don't know you.  I could be a food-writer.  You don't know that.  Do you consider this an acceptable level of service?""   I could feel my inner Robert Irvine coming out. ""No, and that's why your meal is free,"" he said, rather impatiently.  He turned around and walked back to the relative safety of the kitchen (dealing with customers clearly isn't this guy's forte). I dropped $2 on the table for the iced-tea I'd been drinking, and left. I won't be back.  You shouldn't; either.

Tonight, Wife N. is off doing her own thing with a group of ladies, and so I had the kids.  We hit Red Robin for dinner, Friday night, 6:05 PM. Headed in the door to see roughly 40 people in the foyer waiting to be called for a seat.  Surprisingly, despite the crowd, we were seated within about 15 minutes.  Our server took our orders quickly and with a smile. Food arrived at about T+20 minutes from walking in the door---really fast and spot-on even with this large a crowd.  As always, the food is exactly as expected--my son's Kid's Mac and Cheese with Fries and daughter's Bacon Cheeseburger ""hold the cheese"" were both identical to the last thirty-some-odd times they ordered it (our kids have a fondness for the same thing every time).   I decided to try something new and went for the Southwest Grilled Chicken Salad.  Great salad--the chicken had a mild spicing to it, but it was lovely heating it up with these little fried Jalapeno disks that came with it.  I think I may have that one again.   In and out in 40 minutes--service was excellent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hillsboro?start=40,2.256,2.256,2.256,2.256,2.256

We were seated right away (because they were not busy three waiters/waitresses were waiting with the hostess doing nothing) but then waited 20 minutes to have our drink order taken. Another 20 minutes to put in an order for food. My daughter was so hungry she was tearing up. When food finally came 30 minutes later our appetizer did not come first. My daughter's Mac & cheese was soupy and cold. The waitress never came back to make sure we were happy with it. Lucky for us but unfortunately for the table behind us they also ordered the Mac & cheese and called the manager over. So we got the manager right after them. Now this may be the only person who cares if the restaurant does well. He was very accommodating and the only reason I give this place two stars instead of one. He comped the app and my daughter's meal and half of the rest. But unfortunately there was no saving us as customers at this Red Robin. This was there third chance. It was an awful 2 hour experience.

I just got a phone call today and an email from a woman that works at this particular Red Robin location she was extremely apologetic very sympathetic. And wanting to make the situation right. and I didn't ask for this but they gave me a $25 gift card for any Red Robin location. I declined and said that I did not wanted I didn't ask for it that's not what I was looking for. But I appreciated the gesture and she insisted but she gave me the electronic gift card anyway.  So I guess only time will tell if this situation comes of anything. The woman I spoke with today gave me a gesture of faith so I will return the favor and return to the restaurant sometime. I just hope that when my family and I go there that there are changes I hope their staff treat the customers like human beings and not just rushed cash cows.

However, our server was nowhere to be found. Like a ghost. We had finished our food, sodas had long since run dry (no refills on those, either), and we figured it wasn't worth waiting another 20+ minutes to get that fry refill.

Out went Red, the large bird costume, that used to visit each location on a weekly basis. The menu was revamped with alcoholic beverages moved to the front of the menu. The wait time has increased too, though it's not uncommon at this location to have a long wait with empty tables in the restaurant.  If ordering soup or salad before my meal, it will often come out just before our food arrives. When they get it right, the food is delicious. Having a food allergy, I have never gotten sick while eating here. One of my favorite soups, French onion, now comes out in a tiny square dish with hardly any broth in the dish, which is very disappointing. Recently this location added an electronic tablet at every table. Now people can order electronically and be bombarded by online adds for games people can play for a small charge while sitting at the table. I find these units annoying and refuse to use them.

The lady who took our orders didn't even want to look at our faces, she just looked at the screen and nodded after I said anything for my order.

They also have many options to make your meal healthy such as broccoli vs fries. I typically get the BLTA which is surprisingly delicious - fresh croissant and everything.  Service is usually pretty good, though sometimes a bit scatterbrained. There's a tablet on the table that I've never used to order food, but you can if you so want to. More importantly, you can pay your bill instead of waiting.  So...it's perfectly A-OK!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hillsboro,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84

30,Emilee F.,"Hillsboro, OR",63,6,1.0,1.0,2017-01-01,"The worst experience I've ever had at a Red Robin... And I ordered take out! We called to place our order tonight and were put on a 5 minute hold. Fine, it's New Years Day and other restaurants are closed so I'm sure it is busy in there. We placed our order for a Royal Red Robin Burger and Fish and Chips. Nothing crazy. We were told it would be 15-20 minutes. Great! We arrived 25 minutes later. My husband went inside to grab the order. He was ""greeted"" by the bartender and asked if he had a To-Go order and what his name was. (Also I must point out that he was the only to-go customer). She then did nothing with that information and continued to very slowly help the barside patrons. She then told my husband (5 minutes later) that somebody would help him shortly. Another waitress approached my husband and asked his name. She said ""great, let me get it together for you"" At this point he had been inside for about 10 minutes (so we are sitting at 35 minutes of that 15-20 minute window). 5 minutes later the waitress returned with our food. My husband paid and we went on our way with our food 45 minutes after ordering. We made the 5 minute drive home and opened our boxes. Everything was hardly warm and the fish and chips didn't come with tartar sauce. So we are sitting here with soggy cold fish with no dip and a burger that needed to be microwaved. I tried to eat the fish and it tasted like cooled fryer oil. Will not return to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hillsboro?start=20,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88

One stall had no t.p the other was plugged up. Paper towels every where, trash over flowing. Service was awful. Fries were cold. No silverware or napkins. We were celebrating 2 birthdays. Took so long for special desert before our 3 yr old need to leave for bed. Waited for ever for bill. Tried to pay it with iPad which wouldn't take my card. Asked for assistance to get ignored. Ended up leaving cash on the table and leaving with out even a thank you or acknowledgement . We will never visit here again sooo sad to say bye bye Red Robin.

He kept an eye on our drinks and refilled my girls lemonade without even being asked! He offered the bottomless fry refill as well which we always have had to ask for.  We tried the Mac and cheese in the past and it was ew so we stick to the burgers and fries now. They are always delish as well as the chicken strips! The burgers were done to our liking, juicy and they have a variety of burger fillings.. I was impressed with this Tom fellow. He was on top of our service and I saw he interacted well with the other tables he had. And he made sure that I knew the ""biggest beer"" was a huge mug, sadly I was not able to finish my second mug  The only criticism I have is the children's menu being in Spanish. My daughter does not read Spanish so I had to read it to her and she likes reading the menu options herself.. Other than that we had a very pleasant time :-)  Ps Our server did not hand out the menus.. the Host did.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hillsboro,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96
14,Brent P.,"Beaverton, OR",33,3,1.0,2.0,2017-07-01,Red Robin used to be one of my favorite burger joints but not anymore.  Their burgers seem to have gotten smaller and less flavorful.  For today's visit their once fantastic fries were limp and under-seasoned.  My wife always requests her burgers well-done with no pink and 75% of the time they can't get this right.  At this point we will have to think twice about even going for the free birthday burger.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hillsboro,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84

1,Edward R.,"Beaverton, OR",1,5,,1.0,2017-11-21,"First of all let me say that I am definitely not one to review nor am I one to complain but this has definitely caused some frustration.  For the last 10 years I have always thrown a Christmas party for my employees. This year we chose to go to Red Robin near Hillsboro as we typically go to the one near Mall 205 in pdx. I called two locations, the one on TV highway and the one near 185th letting them know that I would like to host my Christmas party there, I do not need a banquet room I just need to make sure they have enough tables and chairs for my employees to have a good time. I also let them know that I would be putting this on my corporate credit card and that this tab ranges anywhere between $1000-$2000 for this type of event. (They will not make that much money in 1.5 any other way). The first location I called which was the TV highway location gave me a definite no and told me that they were not able to accommodate my request. ONE MONTH IN ADVANCE!! I did express to that manager (Sherri) that that seemed to be poor business and that I could not understand how any business with decline this amount of customers and a paid tab. I asked to speak to her manager. I left my number for a call back.  I then called the location on 188th and asked to speak with the manager Julie unfortunately Julie was not available as she is on vacation so I ended up speaking with the gentleman who was the manager of the kitchen named Pallino. Pallino told me the same thing Sherri from the other location told me and that was that they were not able to accommodate my request because of the hours indicated 5:30pm. I then asked to speak with his general manager and that is when he told me her name was Leanne stein. I called Leanne and left a detailed message and asked for a call back. I revived a calla round 40 mins later from Leanne.  So here it goes.... I cannot express enough the amount of unprofessionalism and lack of customer service that I have received from the general manager Leanne Stein. I am appalled that this restaurant would decline a party of 30 people because it was during their peek hours even though I called to to inform them a month in advance that I would be bring my staff to this location on 12/22/17 arriving at 5:30pm and would be done within 1.5hrs.  I was told they will not accommodate me and my employees as they will loose money on a number of tables that are not able to be turned over because of my large party. She tried to break it down to me in a way that felt was very condescending and not needed, she stated she would need six tables in order to accommodate my party and that's too many to lose money on. She said around 3 years ago they used to take larger parties but those larger parties would stay at the restaurant for way too long and they were not able to make the revenue that they would if they would just stop accommodating large parties. I felt like this is VERY poor business and I am not able to comprehend her reasoning from a business standpoint. There is no way that they are going to make in between $1000 and $2000 within an hour and a half no matter how many people they see. This is guaranteed payment!!! I asked if I could speak with her manager she said she did not have one I asked her where the corporate office was located she told me Denver Colorado she also told me that I could escalate this as far as I want but it will end up back on her desk as she is the regional general manager for this area. Her uncalled for comment about escalating this issue is why I am writing this review because I felt she was unprofessional and felt as if she felt she was the ""Person in charge"" of customer issues or complaints which I know is not the case.  I feel she should have done something to accommodate my large party and since I am not getting a call back from the corporate office I decided the only way for my concern to be seen is to leave a review on each location.
