30,Sarah H.,"Pingree Grove, IL",66,365,27.0,4.0,2013-07-21,"Decided on dinner here one evening ... we've been to a couple Red Robin locations in the past, and we happened to be in the area & I had a craving for their pretzel appetizer. We ordered the pretzels and the wing/chips combo for our apps. I noticed right away that the beer cheese with the pretzels was a little on the ""old"" side. It was starting to dry out & just didn't seem right. But, since the pretzels were mainly for my daughter & I anyway (while my husband & son dined on the wings) - I didn't care much because I only use a tiny bit of cheese on 1 or 2 pretzels and then I eat the rest of the pretzels plain. A few minutes later a manager came by, and apologized for the cheese. Said they were in the process of making new cheese and that what came out was not up to their standards, and they were sorry and would bring out fresh soon. It wasn't a big deal and we finished the pretzels, so there wasn't a need for more cheese -- and the manager came back over later and told us he ""took care of the pretzels for us"" and apologized again. I thought that was awesome --- we didn't even complain in the first place -- it just wasn't a big deal --- but they recognized something wasn't up to par, and they went above & beyond rectifying it. The rest of our food was tasty -- and the new garlic fries are pretty good too (though, there is a 99-cent upcharge, which they don't exactly mention when they ask you what kind of fries you want to accompany your sandwich). Overall, they did great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hoffman-estates?start=20,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997

Then we ordered burgers, I ordered the Burnin Love with grilled Chicken, it tasted really good and ordered garlic fries with that. Really awesome burger, heavy stuff. I ordered the mudd pie for dessert - man this was a monster 5 in ice cream layer, which has major chocolate ice-cream, then vanilla with cookie layer, then hard chocolate and then cookie base at bottom, and topped with whipped cream. This is definitely good enough for 3 people to share easily. Definitely try this if you are a sweet tooth and have one more person for company to finish it. Really good service overall.

So why a 2, why else the service. Ive had worse service for sure, there was nothing disasterous that happened it was just the attitude of our server and the lack of care that put a damper on the visit. Our waitress didnt really check on us at all during the meal but she seemed busy so not really a big deal. After we finished we waited a while for a bill and ended up asking her for it as she was at bar about 6 feet from us. She seemed irritated and when we declined desert she gave a bit of an attitude. She dropped off the bill and we gave our card, when the bill came back we noticed that we had been given and charged for someone elses bill. We called her back to notify her and she snatched the bill and said ill get a manager with a lot of negativity and attitude, no apology. Manager came back and rushed through an explanation that they just corrected the charge and didnt double charge us then ran off.

11,Laura N.,"Georgetown, KY",1193,1006,4237.0,3.0,2015-11-19,"Been to this and other locations a few times in the past but I figured I'd write a review after my experience here with my in-laws last weekend.  The good: - Bottomless steak fries! - Onion tower appetizer! YUM. - So many burgers to choose from. - Extensive selection of drinks for a burger place. The not-so-good: - Crazy loud. Just.. too loud in here.  - Long wait. Why are there even this many people eating here on a Saturday night? Red Robin isn't anything special.  - Tables too close together. When we were finished eating, we had to fold our tables up to have enough room to stand up and leave without bumping into the group dining next to us. Soooo awkward.  - Electronic ordering/paying devices. Some might find this useful but I found it kind of impersonal... Our waitress didn't make many appearances. It's also dangerous! We had an eight-year-old at our table that accidentally ordered and paid for a game. We never played it but it was put on the bill. Not cool.  - The bill for a table of eight was $150+ for each to get a burger, a drink (or two), and all to share an appetizer. NOT worth it, in my opinion.  - I ordered the bacon, egg, and cheese burger. It sounded amazing but my expectations exceeded the burger. It was good, but not amazing.  2.5 stars. Rounding up to 3.

Our waitress was...nice...but I don't think she smiled at all...maybe once? It was not that busy, yet our service was really slow and lacking. Our food was great! We each got different chicken sandwiches and pretzel bites as an appetizer. The sides really aren't ""bottomless"" when you're server never comes around to ask you if you'd like more of your side. We also sat for quite some time without any refills on our drinks. Luckily neither one of us ordered anything spicy. I'm giving it 4 stars because of the atmosphere and food and the fact that everyone else we encountered during our visit was friendly. I'm trying to give our server the benefit of the doubt since everyone has bad days. We'll go back...just hopefully with a different server or at least better service...and maybe a smile!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hoffman-estates,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6

This review is focus on the location, more than RR food itself; as its pretty much on par across the chain and is 4 star! Our waitress had way to many tables and the level of service we received was poor.  Twice we had to grab the manager as he wondered through the place to get refills on drinks. I reluctantly ordered a refill on my fries, but that took so long; that the waitress I guess noticed that none on the table and put in another order.  So at a point when we were about to pay the bill through the kiosk, the first refill finally showed up and a min later the second. Maybe it was an off night, but seemed that either the location is understaffed or poorly managed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hoffman-estates,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68

I don't know why they asked if I wanted a little pink in my burger and I said yes it still came in well done. Portions were small, especially the side soups. On the menu it mentions the nachos are now served with extra quac. It was served with ~1/4 cup quac. How disappointed that was. Does that mean at some time prior it was even less? The burgers were good. But everything else you can feel they try to cut all corners. Mostly I was bothered by the  kiosks on our table. I believe they have cameras in each one. I felt uncomfortable feeling these things are recording while we talked and ate. I suppose I could of just turned it around but the ones on the tables across from us were aimed right at us. After dinner, I checked out the kiosk and later found out I was charged $2 for an entertainment fee?  Thank you for the birthday sundae though. That was nice. Overall?
