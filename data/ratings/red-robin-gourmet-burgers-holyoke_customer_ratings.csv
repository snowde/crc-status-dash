The person told a waitress she had a table The waitress Acted as if she didn't want a table and pretty much asked if the other waitress could take it.

We decided to try this branch of RR on Sunday night (1/29/2012) and from the time you walk in the door to time time you leave, the people who work here are practically all smiles.  The attend to you as if you were on your death bed.  They cater to your every need. The place was packed to the gills when we arrived around 7pm, but there was no wait and we got a small booth in the back of the restaurant (near the kitchen area).  It wasn't too close to hear all the kitchen noise, but close enough to see all the orders coming up and servers scrambling to get the hot food to their tables. Our server, Rae, let us know they had run out of fresh melon and were out of two types of bread, but other than that everything was available.  After getting our drinks, she brought an order of french fries to our table (BOTTOMLESS STEAK FRIES!).  I haven't been to RR in many years, so I was surprised to see bottomless fries.   We split a natural burger and a chicken salad.  Both items were very good and our burger was cooked to order.  Our water glasses were filled before we asked (a plus) and Rae checked on us about 3 to 4 times after we got our food. Overall, an excellent experience and I like superior customer service! Xie Xie!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-holyoke?start=20,3.184,3.184,3.184,3.184,3.184

You know, standard menu, bland food, so-so service, uninspired food.  What I found surprised me. Props first to the service, our server (also the bartender) was excellent conversational and offering great recommendations. We asked many questions and she never batted an eye.  Her recommendations were perfect too. We both really enjoyed our meals. The portions were a good size for the price (unlike some chains, eh, Bar Louie). And the fries were as good as advertised (and UNLIMITED)!! I tried the recommended campfire sauce - excellent!  Only two small complaints. One, RR is super popular with the kiddies. There were seemingly thousands of chaotic kids everywhere and the bathroom was a trainwreck as a result.  Second, the drinks were extremely watered down. Not worth a 1/4 what we paid!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-holyoke?start=60,3.1800000000000006,3.1800000000000006,3.1800000000000006,3.1800000000000006,3.1800000000000006

We had an AWESOME Red Robin experience.  Our waitress was extremely friendly and courteous, offering us fries as soon as we sat down and extra dipping sauces!  I ordered a Mai Tai (hey it's Sat night) and it was absolute perfection. My fiancé was nothing but pleased with his never ending Sprites that always made their way to the table before he was finished with the last.  I ordered a burning love burger, which is my go to and was absolutely Yummmmm. I don't like cheese, but forgot to ask for it to be withheld. When the waitress saw me picking off the cheese she insisted on taking it back and giving me a new party, which was super sweet.  My fiancé ordered a Tavern burger which he loved. $6.99 for double patties and secret sauce, who could ask for more?!

The place was busy due to the lunch crowd but we had no problems being seated. The waitress was attentive and cheerful. I'm sad to say this is not the red robin I remembered. I had their original cheeseburger and it was nothing special. I could have made a better burger by going to the local Stop N Shop and making my own with George Foreman grill. The burger was cold and tasteless despite having it with melted pepper jack cheese and all the usual burger toppings. The steak fries were the only thing that I enjoyed. There were hot and crispy which were welcomed company to the cold New England winter.

However, it's been a few years now and let me just say it is so much better. I've probably been there twice this year-oops!- and the service is on top of their game. It's a chain so the food's the same wherever you go but it's always pretty good.

Additionally its one of the few places we can all agree on eating at together with minimal complaint and the restaurant fits a large party in easily on most nights.  Overall they do a bang-up job here. The staff tends to be attentive and the food is delivered hot and tasty if you're into honest-to-fried-goodness.  Only had one recent incident of slow service and cold food. Management was notified and they cheerfully deducted the offending items from the bill without a hassle. For that, they earned an extra star.  Beer geek tip: Always ask whats on draft if you're getting a beer.

Sadly my experience with other area restaurants has left a lot to be desired. I get a lot of strange looks when asked to leave out the bread and such but tonight was a whole new ball game. Our server Kurt asked if my request for a gluten free bun was due to an allergy and from the moment i said yes he made sure the staff was sure to make everything safe for me right down to the fries. Personally i didn't feel he had to go that far but the service was incredible and it really meant a lot. There were no weird looks and no rolled eyes. Just concern that i was well. For the first time i didn't come home from a night out feeling sick to my stomach or embarrassed to have a stupid illness.

Child given rotten chunky milk.  2. Asst manager explaining the frequency of milk delivery.  3. Salad dropped off waited 10 minutes. Finally I got up to get my own silverware 4. Waitress was never seen until we requested the bill. 5. Chicken Alfredo after 45 minute wait was cold. 6. Same Asst Manager explained how they cook it for 5 minutes. 7. Plate of pasta came back and pasta was floating in butter so much that I spooned out 10 tablespoons of butter before I touched it.  Could not eat it because in my head I thought it could have been made with rotten milk. 8. Walking to bathroom watched the same Asst manager eating fries in the open kitchen and then serving plates after. 9. Head Manager argued with my husband that the pasta should have that much butter. He pointed out that the picture in menu of the dish was miles different from my dish. 10.

59,Jocey H.,"Amherst, MA",6,12,4.0,2.0,2017-11-11,"Hit or miss with this location. This time, huge miss. They renovated since we were here last. Previously, the walls were covered with all different size pictures and prints and a large neon Red Robin sign inside. The ceiling tiles were different colors and there were polygon drop lights all around. Now, there's a grand total of 3 art pieces in the whole location, and two of them were painted directly on the wall. The drop lights were mostly eliminated. The grand result? No noise-deadening textures. A deafening cacophony of noise, every voice reverberating in the dining area. Sitting at uncomfortably tight booth seats (we're average, almost small sized people and my father could barely slide into the booth) you could barely hear each other sitting only across the table from each other. Our server finally showed up a good 5 minutes after we had been seated, and it was next to impossible to hear him. Between the speech impediment (bearable) and the low volume he was using, I couldn't hear almost any of his spiel about the new menu items, aside from ""so would you like to start with an appetizer or some drinks?"" Took another 5+ minutes to get two waters and a DrPepper. We asked for fries to hold us over until food arrived. Didn't get those for about 20 minutes. All the while, I was watching the presumed manager (the only guy in the place with a colored shirt, embroidered with Red Robin on the breast) stand around at the hostess station, stand around at the bar, stand around behind the bar, stand around at the hostess station. Not helping the hostesses, not helping the bartender while 4 servers waited for drinks. Just standing around, shooting the shtuff, and meandering through like a mindless cloud of fog. To summarize the rest, it took quite a while to get food, fries, our check, etc. and we left miserably disappointed. I felt bad for my stepmom, whose birthday we were there for, because it was pretty unimpressive to say the least.  If you want to ensure you have a good server and good service, ask for Mary. Every time we come to this location and we get her, it goes fantastically. If it's not Mary, it's hit or miss. Honestly, that woman is a saint of a server.

While the burgers are better than a typical fast food place, this is still a chain so the food remains only slightly above average. So when I'm in the mood for a burger, I am inclined to go to a local burger joint that offers a better burger for roughly the same price. Therefore, Red Robin seldom enters my consciousness. It's not a bad place and I don't think I've ever had a bad experience at a Red Robin.
