My food came out hot, fresh, and cooked to my liking. The fries were all newly made.

If they do notice, they'll look over at you with a sympathetic ""doesn't it suck when your kid is being a PITA?"" look. Also, the service is good. The servers are friendly--although if they are busy, some of them can be slow. (Yes, we mean you, B.) However, if you ever have anything wrong, ask to see a manager, and they will make it right. Back patio is GORGEOUS. Sitting right on the Mon. All RRs have some nice dietary options, i.e., You can substitute a Morningstar burger or a Boca burger (neither are GF) for a beef burger. You can get a GF bun or wrap your sandwich in lettuce. I really like the latter option. You can substitute several things for the fries (since they're unlimited, we usually only have one fry order per table and share) for free and a few more things for a small up-charge.

They have recently added certain new burgers and it seems they're trying to bring more people in. That's fine and the burger was just average. The beers are typically domestic and there's not a ton of variety. They have lots of frou frou drinks if you like that sort of thing and it's good for kids, including a kid menu and balloons.

While I didn't remember the flavors, I did remember my experience fondly. This goes to show that memories as a child can be skewed somewhat. The interior decor is an over-the-top tchotchky reminiscent of a restaurant one might find at a theme park, i.e. Disney World.  On the meal for this visit: Clam chowder Prime Rib Sandwich French Onion Soup Chicken Pesto Pasta I am a very big fan of foods that are layered, but in RR's case I must make an exception. When that layering includes being overseasoned and lacking flavor something is wrong. The people people cooking the meals must not like the flavor of the base ingredients with as much seasoning salt as they use. I was dehydrated for quite some time after having finished my meal.  I really don't understand how I could have liked this restaurant as a child, especially considering I can get better tasting items out of a can or the freezer.

38,Larissa G.,"Pittsburgh, PA",124,575,1132.0,3.0,2013-02-17,"While the Waterfront is a bit out of my way, since it has the theater that's closest to a number of friends, I'm often in the area; my friends are also major Red Robin fans, so I've found myself eating dinner here multiple times before our movie. To be honest, I kind of have a love-hate relationship with Red Robin. It's certainly not my favorite place to eat, particularly during my casual dieting days. Not only are the burgers oversized and/or glazed in some sort of dressing or sauce, all of their appetizers are fried (except for the hummus plate). In short, nothing is waistline friendly unless you're ""that person"" who asks for tons of modifications in their order. I honestly don't think this chain has any interest in developing a lighter option menu, despite these menus' popularity at other restaurants. The only low-calorie item I know of is their skinny margarita, which really doesn't make much of a difference in my calorie intake once the rest of a meal is added in. So that's a big drawback for me. Still, high calorie content or not, I'm a fan of a good burger, and Red Robin can make a reasonably good burger in my experience. Even when I've just shared a meal or nibbled on an appetizer (yes, the same appetizers I complained about earlier - like I said, it's a love-hate relationship) I've been satisfied with the taste and quality of the food given that the place is a chain restaurant.  I've especially been impressed with the servers, who really take the time to check on the table whenever I'm there and to keep us posted on the state of our food in the kitchen (which is very appreciated during the dinner rush, a time of day when any customer can feel forgotten and aggravated). I guess I have to accept what Red Robin for what it is: delicious with a strong dash of dieter's frustration. I'm sure I'll be here again, and, as always, will end up giving in and eating one of their delicious burgers, even if the things are just too much food for little old me. Like I said: love-hate relationship.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-homestead?start=20,2.88,2.88,2.88,2.7640000000000002,2.88
52,Josh C.,"Pittsburgh, PA",43,207,3.0,2.0,2013-05-02,"Unlimited fries is a phrase that should make you start asking questions. Typically when a restaurant offers any food item as ""never ending"" you should probably use better judgement and steer clear of it.  Welp, I didn't, thus I failed.  Red Robin is a chain place that claims to have amazing burgers and infinite fries.  The fries are almost soggy steak fries that don't pair well with the burgers.  They tasted as if they've been sitting under a warming lamp and I didn't ask for a fill up.  The burgers were okay, but neither of ours were cooked the way we wanted.  I asked for Medium it was medium well.  My wife asked for well and it was medium well.  I bet the cook just cooks everything to medium well.  Good for him.....

But I mostly enjoy the steak fries. These are my favorite type and RR gives you free refills on fries. A little RR seasoning on them and they are even better.

Sometime though if at the waterfront I'll stop at Red Robin, mainly for the freckled lemon aid.  On a recent visit I decided to try their veggie burger, I ordered it with lettuce, onion and pickles. I had a hard time deciding if this was a Morning Star Farms offering or house made. If it was a frozen patty, shame on them. True burger joints need to show the vegans and vegetarians that Red Robin wants their business and should make an in house patty. The waiter could not answer my question regarding to my inquiring if their meatless burger was house made or frozen. It wasn't bad though.  In my pre- vegan days I loved the monster burger and endless fries.

The parents all find the screaming to be ""cute"" of course and won't dare stop their precious little angels from ruining your dinner.

They have been much better lately though. - No sliders. Why? Who knows. - If you order the short stack of onion rings, you get the smaller end.

I use to love the bottomless fries, but not so much anymore.  That says something coming from a potato lover.   It's like this place feel into a rut and cannot get out.  Like they became too comfortable in what they do and just decided one day that what they do will remain the same and people's attitudes won't change.

It's definitely a good place for families; they have a decent kid's menu with both healthy (apple slices, oranges, salad, grilled chicken) and indulgent (corn dog, pizza, fries) choices, and they hand out crayons and a coloring sheet, so that's a plus in my book.

30,Hannah M.,"Brentwood, PA",17,56,46.0,4.0,2014-12-12,"It's been at least a year since the last time I was at a Red Robin, so it was practically like going in for the first time after so long.  The service was excellent. Our server was very quick, friendly, and genuine. God bless anyone working at a service job at the Waterfront during the holiday season that can even fake a friendly attitude, much less be genuinely sweet. It was refreshing (not that I even can blame the grumpy servers at this time of year). Our food also came out unbelievably, especially for a burger place. It usually feels like forever for your food to come out at a place like this because you have to wait for all the burgers to be cooked just right. I honestly didn't even believe it was our food.  If you don't know, Red Robin is known for its burger selection. They've got a lot of interesting choices that include chicken and vegetarian options. I got the Chili Chili Cheese Burger. It's no secret that I love pretty much chili cheese anything. I asked for no pink in the middle. The burger was cooked perfectly. It wasn't overdone, but there was no pink. It was tender and flavorful. On the burger was chili and cheddar cheese (obviously), raw red onions (which I could have done without. They didn't add much flavor, and the chunks were a little big so it added a weird crunch to the burger. I'm also not a huge fan of raw onions. So I may be biased), and a chipotle sauce. The burger was much spicier than I anticipated. It wasn't an overwhelming heat. It was more of a flavorful warmth. Though, be warned, if you don't do well even with mild-medium heat, I'd stay away from this one. The burger was around $11, but I definitely think it was worth the $11.  Red Robin serves bottomless steak fries with all of their dishes. The fries were also cooked perfectly. They were warm and golden, but not overly crispy...or even worse, limp. Our server was wonderful and frequently checked if we wanted more fries.  This isn't the kind of place I'm dying to go back to. I wouldn't say it's anything special considering it's just another burger chain, but they do what they do well. They're fast, friendly, efficient, and prepare their food well. It's definitely a good experience! Though generally I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, I'm sure I'll be back when the craving monster strikes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-homestead?start=20,2.96,2.96,2.96,2.8320000000000003,2.96

The best I can say for Red Robin at the Waterfront is that it sports a full bar but the craft beers here are limited. I was there for about 45 minutes and during that whole time, the bar wasn't bussed once and I dined next to a used empty glass.  This place is either severely understaffed or miss managed (or both).

I also noticed that their tag line is ""Burgers and Brew"" which is a good since Craft beers are what people are looking for these days.  We were seated in the bar area. It also had been remodeled. I loved the huge lighting fixture made from beer bottles.  I ordered a Cobb Salad with no tomatoes. It was supposed to come with Garlic Toast. The salad was good but the piece of chicken was small. It looked like a lunch portion not a dinner portion. The 2 pieces of Garlic Toast were the size of bread you use for Brushetta.  That was disappointing.  My son ordered a Royal Burger with fries.

Server was pleasant but not good - incorrect drinks, never brought requested condiments, waited extended amounts of time for drinks, etc. Food was worse - we ordered our burgers ""Medium"" and both received burgers that oozed blood when cut in half. Asked for replacements and waited 25 minutes and once new food arrived found the burger patties to be burnt on the outside and cooked thru to cardboard consistency on the inside. French fires were also a mix of cooked ok and slightly undercooked with a few that were still cold inside and barely thawed. Manager came to table and said he would take one meal off the check and said he was told we wanted ""Well Done"" burgers. We informed him that we wanted Medium burgers which shouldn't be bloody but did not want burnt, flavorless charred burgers and undercooked fries.

60,H.T. N.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,15,,2.0,2015-11-23,"I'm a fan of Red Robin's food. I like their sandwiches and bottomless fries. However, this location needs work in costumer service and management. I've been to this location twice. The first time, I went with someone during the late afternoon/early evening on a weekday. It was not very busy, but it took awhile for someone to take our orders. And then we waited about 15 minutes for our margaritas. We got our food and wanted to order more fries since there were probably only 8 fries on our plates, but our server was nowhere to be found. We later realized that he was both the bartender and the server. Not very practical or efficient. When he finally came to our table and we ordered more, he disappeared for a long while again to make drinks for the people at the bar. There were other servers, so I'm unsure why he was bartending AND waiting tables. Anyway, when he did bring out more fries, there were only 6 fries. Yeah, some ""bottomless""... We ordered more, and after another round of waiting and waiting, another 6 fries came out. Other Red Robins have not been so stingy with their fries, especially if the server is going to disappear for long periods of time and not check on you. We went again on a Saturday night, so we expected it to be busy. But to wait 45 minutes for two sandwiches is ridiculous. Also, we didn't have any silverware for my friend to eat his starter salad, and we rarely saw our server, so we had to wait about 10 minutes after the salad arrived to ask her for a fork. And when we later ordered more fries, our server was extremely rude, almost as if we were inconveniencing her. When I asked her for more, she just sighed and walked away. After a few minutes, she came back and said, ""I put the order in but it's going to take five minutes to cook. Are you SURE you still want them?"" It's strange that she didn't have time to check on us for refills on drinks, silverware, or ask how our food was, but she sure made time to stop at our table and suggest that we should cancel our second basket of fries because it needs to be cooked! I've been to other Red Robin locations and they have been great. But I won't be back to this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-homestead?start=60,2.92,2.92,2.92,2.152,2.92

I wasn't feeling adventurous, and for a burger place, I thought a  bacon cheeseburger would be a good place for them to shine. Also, they have a great sense of their customers because any burger can be wrapped in lettuce for low carb or gluten free fans.  Their milkshakes are priced well, I think it was 3.99 and that's great for Pittsburgh.  The bathroom was messy for early on a  Saturday night though.  Finally, they added little computer screens for games you play while you wait for food, but it is also how you pay. We had a problem with our screen, and the waitress helped us, but here's how she did it.

Being my brother's birthday and not wanting to go against the general consensus I met my family down at this Red Robin for lunch on Saturday. The hostess was generally unhelpful due to half my party already being seared and her just sort of shrugging and not leading us back to the table. Luckily my brother is hard to miss so I was able to find him easily.  We started off with a few apps: onion ring tower and pretzels with beer cheese. We would have also had the hummus but unfortunately they were out. The onion rings were standard--crunchy and onion-y. Breading didn't totally fall off which is always nice. The pretzels were piping hot with a crispy exterior and a soft center with not too much salt. That is how I prefer my pretzels so I was pleased. The cheese dipping sauce was very strong and overpowering. I'd skip it, but my family seemed to really like it.  My main burger was something with Bleu cheese, onion straws and some unfortunate tasting orange sauce. The sweet potato fries made up for it, but I found the onion bun + Bleu cheese to be a not so good combo. My sister had a similar complaint about her Southern Comfort burger, saying that there were entirely too many flavors competing and none of them complimented each other.  Someone else had the 4 cheese melt and honestly I'm bummed out that I didn't get it. It was a grilled cheese with the perfect amount of cheese, perfect crispness, and excellent bread. 10/10 would get it again.  For dessert we tried the croissant donuts. They were warm and yummy, but not worth $8.99 per order. I'd rather go to Dunkin.  Though the place was decently full for 2pm, our server was prompt, friendly, and quick with refills. I liked being able to pay at the table with cards instead of having to have them run back and forth processing everything.

We had several endless fries as well. Now, where to begin. Service was s-l-o-w. The garden burger was cold, dry, and the patty was beyond consumption, literally. It had massive bites taken into it, and was hard as a rock.  My endless fruit was fruit preserves, likely because nothing there is fresh, and was never refilled. In fact, none of the fries were refilled without taking several minutes to wave down the servers, which were not particularly attentive.  The sweet potato fries were terrible.

To this she responded ""Well they all kinda look like that...Sooooo. I'll try to find you the cleanest ones."" That's not exactly an excuse. At this point i was seriously questioning the cleanlinest of this resteraunt. Despite that, i went on to order. We started out with 2 flavorless apps (These zuchini sticks and mini pretzels... I do not recommended.) Then we went on to order our burgers. I've had much better, I'm not sure why people rave about this place. After paying for our check suddenly the waitress ran back to inform us that we had recieved the wrong check. She handed us a much higher one then proceded to hover in the area until we payed. Overall, i regret not going somewhere else. I could have had a better lunch at Mcdonalds",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-homestead?start=20,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
25,Rachel B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",3,69,,2.0,2016-10-02,"The service here today was pretty bad.  Not only was it nearly impossible to get someone over to our table at any point during our meal, when someone did come, our order was completely wrong, the food was not good, and I never could get a drink refill.  I'm not sure what the problem was- I saw plenty of people stocking the bar, wandering around, and cleaning glasses.  The manager offered to remove the item from the bill that we didn't order, and then she forgot.  Overall, I would not come here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-homestead?start=20,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6
4,Stephen R.,"Cleveland, OH",50,52,58.0,3.0,2016-11-20,"This chain has quite the assortment of burgers and sandwiches. I signed up for their birthday club and I rarely come here outside of my birthday month when I receive a free burger. Their ""bottomless fries"" make for quite the challenge and it's fun to see just how many servings you can get through.  The only problem is that I've always had an issue with the servers coming back in a timely manner, so I rarely get my fill of fries before I reach the limits of my patience.  They're making an effort to modernize their restaurant, so many functions such as ordering drinks, ordering appetizers, and paying for the tab can be done from a tablet posted at the table. This feels very impersonal at times and I would prefer to stick to the old-fashioned way of doing things but I can appreciate the attempt.  With the many options here, I've been able to try something different each time and I've always been satisfied. Their drinks seems overpriced in relation to their food pricing, but I assume they have to make their money somehow.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-homestead,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68
5,Casey K.,"Seattle, WA",191,183,776.0,2.0,2016-12-04,"I'm writing this as a review to my future self... Hi Future Self, This is Past Self. Did you just drive into the Red Robin parking lot? Then turn around and find somewhere else for your meal. ""It's convenient,"" you might say. Or ""everywhere else has a longer wait."" Don't let this discourage you, you CAN have a way better experience somewhere else. You will undoubtedly walk in and wait at least a few minutes, only to be brought to a table that is either unclean, missing utensils, or something else. The wait staff will arrive only to provide poor service or forget about you all together and you will need to go in search of a team member or manager to help you in another part of the restaurant. When you finally receive your food you will be underwhelmed and left empty, sad that you ultimately did decide to have your meal here. ""It's really not that great,"" ""I don't know why we came here,"" you'll say to yourself. Future Self--I implore you, go somewhere else and get lured in by the bottomless fries.

3,Eryn P.,"Pittsburgh, PA",196,91,183.0,1.0,2017-02-19,"Burgers. If you follow me, you know I love them. You also know that I rarely leave a one star review.  Today's trip to Red Robin was frustrating. I had Mom and Dad with me today, out for a late valentines date.  We were greeting only after my dad said hello to the Hostess. She was too busy blowing up balloons to say hello.  Our server was quickly at our table, and slow to bring the wrong drinks. My dads a diabetic, and she brought him sweetened peach tea, after he asked multiple times if it was unsweetened. Whatever. She eventually got it right.  She takes our order from memory. (She also forgot to introduce herself, so she's fortunate that her name isn't smeared throughout this review.) I HATE when servers do that. You're not gonna remember everything. Our food comes out and dads fries are on moms plate, mom doesn't have her spicy sauce on the side, and my burger that was supposed to be pink, is well done. There's also only five fries on my plate. So, I placed a reorder.  Ten minutes later, no fries. Dads ready for more, too. She's over at the bar, on her phone. Sorry, I use my phone a lot, but never in front of the people I work with, or does it deter me from doing my job. This girl was Candy Crushing something serious when I walked over to the bar, and asked about the fries. ""Oh, I didn't know you wanted more!"", was her response. Again, whatever.  The manager comes out with the fries in what seems like a millisecond. He tosses them on the table, ignores our empty drinks and goes away with no interaction.  I always wonder why you wait for an eternity here. They're never busy. Their parking lot is basically just overflow for Mitchell's.  I'll say it a third time, as never go back to homestead, whatever.  Happy Eating, Just not here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-homestead,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
9,Paul H.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,77,1.0,1.0,2017-04-01,"I've been twice. The garden burger was uninspired. They need to find a better source for their buns. The caesar salad (either the ""Mighty"" size or the smaller side salad) was pretty lame: two times too much dressing. The server's attitude seemed to be that quantity takes priority over quality (they kept asking my friend if he wanted refills of french fries (I tried one, found it disappointingly soggy, and had no more).

Hadn't been to Red in years and figured since ALL they do is burgers, it should be pretty good. WRONG. I got a tiny double burger smothered in a BBQ sauce made from MAYO!!! Nasty. I sent it back because I requested no mayo and got the SAME burgers just scraped off and put back on my basket. cold. Fried were cold too. I sent them back and got another batch of cold fries. They did take off the burger from the bill, but please do yourself a favor and stay away from these chains.

Their take out here is awesome- we ordered the burger with bottomless fries and since we weren't dining in, I asked if we could have extra fries on the side. Without hesitant, they said yes and we received two orders of fries. Pretty awesome.

It was better than expected to be honest.  I gave it four stars because it was good food for the value, subtotal right around $25.
