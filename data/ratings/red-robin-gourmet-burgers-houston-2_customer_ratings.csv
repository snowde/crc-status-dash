119,Vinita C.,"Houston, TX",9,25,,2.0,2012-04-20,"I went with my friend after a movie tonight and we were both starving! We got the artichoke dip and it was greeeeeat. We both loved it.  Both of us got burgers as well. She got the mushroom one and I got the bleu ribbon burger. Our burgers tasted great, but for her, the mushrooms were completely falling out while she ate them. For me, it was just wayyyyy too big to fit into my mouth AND it kept falling apart as I ate it. Now, it really did taste great, but when I eat a burger, I want it to stay together so I can eat all the different parts of it in one bite. And we also both got mac and cheese. We were both disappointed in what we were served. It was a tiny little bowl of it and it literally looked like they put the pasta in the bowl, added cheese and microwaved it. It wasn't creamy or delicious in any way, shape or form. The service was great and the food was good overall, but we were really disappointed in the burgers and mac and cheese.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-houston-2?start=100,2.7600000000000007,2.7600000000000007,2.7600000000000007,2.7600000000000007,2.7600000000000007

So, having said that...let's be real, this isn't fabulous foodie dining.  The food is reliable, in that generic chain-y way, but the service has always been cheerful and they do a great job of having information readily available about allergens in their food.  Husband's meals always come with an allergy alert and the kitchen knows not to put any of the seasoning on his fries, so he avoids the ""inner turmoil"" associated with back-of-house oopsies.  As it were.

I like to get what I pay for and at the very least, I expect to get the ingredients that are listed on the menu. I watched the bartender make my drink and he swapped ingredients. I ordered a Tropical Mai Tai- the ingredients listed on the menu are: A blend of Myer's Dark and Bacardi Select rums, Orange Curaçao, fruit juices, grenadine & sweet 'n sour.  Rather than adding Bacardi the bartender used Ron Rio- which is a very cheap rum with poor quality and gives a hangover. I called the bartender out on it and asked that he make the drink with the ingredients listed on the menu and he was abrasive. I asked to speak with the manager and he came over and justified why they used cheap liquor and said that he didn't know why the menu didn't say Ron Rio instead of Bacardi because that's what they use. I told him that we both know why Ron Rio isn't listed because no one wants to consume it, therefore the drink wouldn't sell. The manager said he would instruct the bartender to make the Mai Tai the way I asked, but the drink never came. I eventually completed my meal and asked for the check, of which I was charged for the Mai Tai. I, then, requested the charge be removed and left the establishment. Burgers are awesome!

Here's a play by play of my experience at Red Robin. Got to the restaurant with my friend, and a wait to be seated; about 15 minutes. Waited about 8 minutes before a waiter came. They looked short staff, and very busy. And yet, some tables dotted the place vacant. We've just ordered, my friend now decides to see how long it would take to fill up his water, and a countdown begins... We are now at 12 minutes. I have my margarita. Supposed to be one of the best, but could use more tequila. (That's just me tho, I like a strong margarita). Oops! Someone almost slips on some water in the restaurant! Our waiter (yes) is moping it up. 15.30 minutes... 21 minutes (waiter spotted in distance)... 24.30....waiter comes up, says the ticket was lost, but now found. They are know just putting in our order. Are you kidding me... Oh, btw, water still empty (update: 27.25) and I ordered a shot of tequila to put in my drink. 31.30. Shot of tequila arrives. We're hungry. Food!! 35.30 Water!!! 38 flat. And the burgers are pretty good. Things are coming quicker, which is nice. Used the bathroom, no paper towels, had to use toilet paper to wipe hands. Bathroom needed some TLC. Are the employees using this bathroom too? Boy... That's disgusting. I'm ready to leave. Check comes, they did discount us a bit for the ""lost ticket"", that was cool. But really, the meals are free remember lol, so it doesn't matter. To conclude, not a good experience for my first time at Red Robin, which I was thinking to take my fiancé.

57,Jen N.,"Spring, TX",173,21,22.0,5.0,2015-01-31,"Unlimited fries, drinks and a delicious burger. What more can you ask for?  Almost all specialty burgers comes with a side of bottomless fries. You can choose from garlic fries or regular fries. If you don't want a side of fries you can always switch it to a side of broccoli, fruits or something else. If you wanted onion rings then it would just be 1 serving. But since I'm a college student, you know I'll be getting my money's worth.  I got the chili chili burger with ghost pepper sauce on the side. This sauce was AMAZING, if you like spicy ask them for this on the side. I dipped my fries in it as well and it was heavenly. But note that I'm one of those people that would order the spiciest wings at Buffalo Wild Wings that usually come with a label saying ""caution: may irritate skin.""

We were seated right away but for some reason the service was SLOW for really no one being in there. They were definitely I feel staffed quite well for not many customers.  We ordered an onion tower and it was ok. I think it was a little too crispy and tasted a little like it was cooked in old grease or something. It was decent though. We ordered our food which was a whiskey burger and then some snack buffalo bites. It took quite awhile to get the food out. I started to look and could see the buffalo bites sitting (and not under the heat lamps either) for a good 7-10 minutes before one of the gentleman running food brought it out.  The bites were not appetizing AT ALL. They were overcooked and the extra sauce they brought with it looked awful. The sauce was separating and looked like it had a layer of oil on top. We even tried mixing it and it didn't work. I showed the waitress and asked for another one and the second one she brought was just as bad. Needless to say it wasn't touched. We were done eating and sitting there waiting for her to come pick up the checks and she just stood there behind the bar on the phone with another employee until I was about to get up and bring it to her. I don't really see the reason why the service was so poor and the food when it wasn't even that busy. I WOULD NOT recommend eating here :( yuck,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-houston-2?start=60,2.8,2.8,2.8,2.02,2.8
62,Annie H.,"Houston, TX",23,41,7.0,1.0,2015-12-18,"Bummer! I've been a long time Red Robin fan and I am super disappointed. Let's start with the positives. The #namethatchicken was delicious and the bottomless fries are always good. The end.  The service was pretty much awful. The kid wasn't overly friendly but whatever. He was inattentive. Our drinks were empty and my husband's burger came out without the extra patty he ordered. Shouldn't you check that before you get to the table? So it got sent back, along with his fries of course, so he got to sit and watch me eat (yes, I shared my fries but come on). The waiter disappears.  Meanwhile, we order more drinks from the friendly curly haired waitress who stopped by to pick up my empty glass. When he finally reappeared with my husband's food we get a nonchalant ""Sorry about that."" And a ""Oh, you're finished?"" After he notices my empty plate. Yes, after 15 minutes my burger and shared fries are gone. PS where are the drinks we ordered and could we maybe get another basket of fries?  Oh and, it was my birthday and I told him I said wanted to use my Red Robin Rewards for my free birthday meal. Somehow this got mucked up because I ordered the wrong kind of burger so we just got 20% off. Ok, fine, but shouldn't you have mentioned that when I ordered? I feel like he should've.  I'm bummed.

Where they lack is the service and cleanliness of the restaurant.  We were at Marqe on Christmas Day and decided to have lunch here. We walked in and were seated at a booth next to the door to get to the patio. Well, behind me were three bus boys just chatting away, without thinkibg that there was somebody behind them trying to enjoy a meal with his wife.  We decided to move to a booth down the aisle and noticed there was ranch dipping on the ground. I dont mean just a spot, but a handful on the floor. We were there 1.5 hours, and the ranch was there the entire time.  Well, we got to ordering as we were finally able to get some peace and quiet. We ordered the pretzel bites, which were pretty good, but the cheese sauce was bland.  For our entre we ordered a Keep It Simple (medium well) and a Whiskey BBQ with pepper jack (medium). The burgers were juicy, somewhat thick and flavorful. The fries are whatever.  The part that is the worst of our experience... we saw our waitress three times. Once when she took our drink order, next when she brought our drinks and took our main orders, and lastly when she brought our check. We were hoping to order the croissant doughnut things, but without us asking for a check, our waitress decided that we were done and she brought our check.

You no longer get a gigantic laminated menu but now you get a book.  I got their limited time berserker x burger. I guess it's to promote the new xmen movie. The burger overall was only ok. Patty was cooked well but didn't have much seasoning to it. The sriracha onion straws didn't really have that much of a spicy kick to it. However the aioli was tasty. They now give you dipping sauce for their bottomless fries. They have this one sauce that kind of tastes like chik fil a sauce. We also got the the nana nana moo moo shake.

On a previous visit, I sat at the bar, my burger arrived quickly, my drinks arrived quickly, and my fries were promptly restocked upon request.  Of course, this was a weekday during lunch and the place was completely empty. On my last visit, service was just terrible.  My girlfriend ordered her burger well-done, but it came out roughly medium and she had to send it back.  I ordered my burger medium and it came out well-done (probably got the orders crossed because she never bothered to write it down), but I just gave up and ate it.  Another person in our group ordered sweet potato fries and got regular fries.  She literally managed to mess up three of the four orders at our table. We ended up requesting our checks early and getting the hell out of there.  We had originally planned on having milkshakes for dessert, but with how poor the experience was,  The one thing this place does consistently bad is apply discounts.  I had a $2 off offer on the aforementioned previous visit and it wasn't taken off my tab.  I had a $4 off $10+ coupon on the most recent visit and it similarly wasn't discounted.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-houston-2,2.4,2.97,2.97,2.088,2.742

85,Belly G.,"Houston, TX",616,836,4932.0,3.0,2017-04-01,"Red Robin serves decent burgers. Personally, their appeal to me is because of a couple of things: bottomless steak fries and bottomless strawberry lemonade. If this is your first time here, their menu can be overwhelming. First thing to do is to see their burgers 411 page so you know what's what. They have three kinds of burgers: Angus meat, regular meat, and tavern style (smaller size). Despite the description and the pictures that you see on the menu pages to make it sound like their burgers are as big as a mammoth, their burgers aren't actually that big. I usually always enjoy my burgers when I come here, but their prices are pretty high. For example, my Smoke & Pepper burger cost $13.99. I added a fried egg on top for an additional charge making it a $15 burger!! For that kind of money, I could have gotten a real delicious tasting burger from Stanton's City Bites and then some. My bill for the one burger + strawberry lemondae ($5!) + tax and tip was well over $25. Yeah, that's not going to do it for me. On the flip side, the service was not too bad and you can pay for your meal using one of those tabletop machines. This restaurant is also conveniently located right across from the Marq'E theater. On the down side, it's freezing in here. I'm not one to complain about a room's temperature being too cold, but even in the Houston heat, with all the A/C blasting cold and the fans on high, I was freezing.

Intended to go to another restaurant in the shopping center that was unexpectedly closed.  Arrived to Red Robin at 5:55 and explained the situation.  We asked if they could possibly accommodate a party of 12 around 6:30.  Was told it was no problem.  Waited outside and checked back in at 6:30.  Was told they had given away our tables because they were busy and we would have to wait longer.  Asked about how much longer at 7:00.  Was told 30-45 MORE minutes.  The manager walked up and asked me what I expected with a big party on a Friday night and told me they didn't take reservations.  Clearly there's a huge lack of communication in this restaurant.  No one ever apologized or acknowledged they confirmed they could accommodate us at 6:30, just treated us like we were in the wrong and were incredibly rude to us.  Poor communication.  Poor customer service.  Went around the corner to Cafe Adobe who told us we would have to wait 10 minutes and then sat us in 5.  Could have been a disaster on my birthday but thankfully Cafe Adobe saved the day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-houston-2?start=20,2.32,2.78,2.78,2.468,2.596

91,Andrew W.,"Sugar Land, TX",16,1,,2.0,2017-04-21,"Ten years ago I dined at Red Robin once a week and found it a good value.  But, time has not been kind to the Robin.  First off, the dining area had a greasy smell... not good.  The burger menu is very extensive and after some reflection I ordered a Southern Comfort Burger. The photo showed a desirable 1/2 pound burger with caramelized onions, bacon and lettuce.  The kitchen will no longer prepare the half pound burgers rare. They said they'd do mine medium. What was served up was a very dry, very well done meat patty that was devoid of any savory goodness.  The bun was the next disappointment. My burger served on a   Chibatta roll that was chibatta in name only. The bread was soft and had the texture of an ordinary hamburger bun. Baking a roll in a square shape doesn't make it chibatta. During my meal the bun completely disintegrated making a mess of my hands.   The endless steak fries were good provided they were served hot from the oil.   The margaritas were, however, very good.  I'd certainly consider having those again.  My waitress was exceptionally attentive and moderated my response.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-houston-2,2.36,2.79,2.79,,2.6180000000000003

So I've been waiting for 30 minutes for the manager and I've seen him chatting with other customers.  not once until I asked for him did he come by to apologize for  their mistake.he did compensate us.

I fixed my craving by trying the Black & Bleu burger. It's loaded with angus beef, sautéed mushrooms, caramelized onions, blue cheese, dijon sauce on a ciabatta bun and it was so damn good. My boyfriend went the safe route and built his own cheeseburger. Although you will spend more here than your average burger joint here and the fries are average, here are 3 reasons why I recommend you trying it out. 1. They have a nice variety of gourmet/ specialty burgers and soft drinks.  2. Unlimited French Fries.  3.
