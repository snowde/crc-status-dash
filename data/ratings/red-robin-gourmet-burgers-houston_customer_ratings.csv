Our server was sweet and helpful in making choices. She even recommended that my husband get a larger burger because the one he was going to get was pretty small. Glad he did. The portions were tiny. They do have ""bottomless"" french fries but we chose to just eat what we had and then leave. All in all this place was OK.

I had the prime chophouse burger today; instead of fried I got the side steam broccoli.  I forgot to take a picture of it; about five pcs. Of tinny broccoli inside of sauce cup. For a $10 burger, I expect to get at least a cup size side order.  I had to ask kitchen to redo my burger.  It was left under the light too long. The bread was hard n dry.  I don't know what went wrong, I did not touch my burger about 5 ms after it arrived to my table; why my cheese wasn't melted? So, I touched the meat n yes; kind of cold.  You know, I could have just go to get a hot, warm n tasty burger from dollar menu.  I only visit this location once a year n I have my reason n you all should know why now.  I guess Red Robin just lost me n my family as customers.

The food isn't worth the hellish service. We were seated, ignored for 15 minutes (only 1 other couple seated in our section, rest of the place was equally dead), finally a waiter named Chris realized we hadn't been waited on, took our order (Chophouse Burger combo and an Avo-Cobbo Salad) and then said he would figure out who was supposed to be serving our section. He brought us our drinks immediately. We then waited and waited and waited, until Laura, our actual server came by and said ""Your food will be ready in a minute"" and then walked off. And we waited. Food finally shows, not served by Laura. That server refilled our drinks.  Laura was walking around but never came to check on us. My boyfriend had to flag her down to get another drink refill and to ask for more fries. Those fries never came. We finally flagged her down and asked for a to-go container for my salad and our check. We waited. She comes back with the to-go container but said we had to wait for ""Someone else"" to get our bill. Beyond frustrated. We get our bill, I pay cash and we wait forever for change.

35,Leslie T.,"Houston, TX",170,588,264.0,3.0,2014-03-05,"Burger patties have shrunk, prices gone up, service still the usual inattentive.  That pretty much sums it up. The meat patties used to be a lot thicker. They will still let you get it cooked medium rare though which a lot of places won't do. The burgers used to be a definite 2 handed meal. Now they have made them genuinely ""gourmet"" and shrunk them down to mere shadows of their former selves. I see that they want to make the toppings the star of the meal but you still want a decent sized patty of beef.  Every time they redo the menu they jack the prices up a buck or two. They now have a fancy topped burger with ciabatta bread for $13. I can get 2 Whataburger full meal deals with everything including a fistful of napkins because it's so damn huge for $15. So if you are looking for value THIS is not your best bet in the neighborhood. They offer lots of different burgers for $9-$13 and you can customize them with your choice of cheese, guac, bacon, gluten free rolls (upcharge) and sometimes this location gets those changes and additions right. Usually not, but sometimes they do on the first try! I would say 7 times out of 10 I have had to send my Sammy back to get it topped with what I ask to be on it. I won't deny that the food is tasty. I do like their relish, their cobb salad is still one of my favorites and am still a fan of the freckled lemonade ($5 bottomless). They have a full bar and usually some nifty cocktail ideas.  Their steak fries are bottomless too and if you want something besides ketchup now they have an assortment of dipping sauces for them - or to smear on your burger. I honestly tried the spicy ketchup (eh), Red's Secret Tavern Sauce (1000 island mixture) and the thai sauce (firey but sweet) and found none of them to be better than some good ol' ketchup. But it was nice to have the choices. You can get veggie burgers and chicken. The kids menu is a nice value for $5-$6. It includes corn dogs, pizza and the like with some nice side choices besides the fries...stuff like fruit and apple slices. Onion rings now come in the huge tower size and a smaller version which is much better for two folks to share. It's a sit down place where kids are welcome. It's clean and the food is good. But with prices continuing to go up and serving sizes continuing to go down I doubt I'll be frequenting this Red Robin as often as I used to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-houston?start=20,2.96,2.96,2.96,2.572,2.96

28,Shana H.,"Houston, TX",48,170,86.0,1.0,2015-03-21,"Came here on a Thursday night and it was pretty empty. We were sat immediately, however it took a good 6 minutes for a server to come and even get our drink orders. When he did, he was not very engaging, and sort of mumbled. Drinks did not take long to get. We proceeded to order when he returned. My bf specifically asked if they had the crab cake burger because the Katy location is always out. He assured him that they had them, and took his order. I ordered a salad, and specified no cucumbers and no bacon. Can you guess what happened? So about 20 minutes go by, no, literally 20 minutes. How do I know? Because I was texting my mother, and looked at my phone to confirm. A manager approaches our table to tell us that they ""looked high and low"" and did not have any crab cake burgers.  Soooo...it took 20 minutes to figure this out? It is CERTAINLY not as if the place was packed - there were about 5 tables filled. And I mean tables of 2 or 3 people... As she walked away with his NEW order, a female server comes to our table telling us that she was now our server as our previous one was leaving....umm ok. As a member of the service industry myself, I thought that was pretty shitty of them, shows very little respect for customers. I've never seen that personally, you always have to wait until your last table leaves, just the way the cookie crumbles... So, as we received our chili, which was the highlight of the night, we kept seeing our first server, seemingly doing nothing. The manager seemed oblivious to our frustration. When sh brought my salad, it had bacon AND cucumbers on it, and while I was super angry I said that I would pick it off. Afterall, I had waited about 30 minutes for my damn food to begin with!! I do not eat pork, and found it to be shitty, yet again, that they got that part wrong. I will CERTAINLY never be back. Shame on you, Red Robin. Also, we were sat at this tiny littl table for 2, when the waitress came to check on us, she never took a single item off of the table.

41,Thierry T.,"Houston, TX",143,193,327.0,4.0,2015-03-27,"1. Service - excellent, can't complain. Great every time I come. The managers have the waitstaff trained to service all the same. They frequently check on you and they always carry a smile. It's an A-La-Carte system, wait to be seated, order at the table, and pay at the end.  2. Price - about $11-$30 a person. For the few times I've been here, it's always some sort of hamburger or chicken sandwich. You can't buy a burger or sandwich for less than $10. But with all this being said, it's worth it. About average for price.  3. Ambiance - dress code here is casual. The place is very relaxing. A cool hangout spot with friends or family. Large enough for parties. Jeans and flip flops are ok! 4. Food - I'm quite simple, a Lone Star Burger is my favorite. What's even better are their bottomless fries. Meaning, you pay for a tray of fries and they keep refilling at no extra cost!  5.

Probably full of sugar, but also fiber ;) The last time I went my friend and I ordered an appetizer of fried mozzarella and zucchini. The zucchini came in nice large wedges, and was very good. The mozzarella was typical. I had the Whiskey River burger this last time; I've ordered once with chicken instead, and I think that is much better. The last visit the burger was just so greasy the bottom bun was completely flattened and soaked. There may have also been other sauces, but really seemed to be mostly grease. I think next time I might try one of their burgers on a ciabatta bun. I also had a side of the aioli, which I think was garlic aioli, but mostly tasted very herby. Not bad, just not what I was expecting/wanting. One of my friends really likes their burger with pineapple. Desserts look great, but have never had room to go that far...

However, in the past six months or so, it's been awful on both counts. The waiters are very slow and not very attentive to our needs and the food just isn't what it used to be. There is never really a crowd, so it seems ridiculous to wait for nearly 40-50 minutes for your food.  I am truly disappointed at the way this restaurant is changing. I have driven the 30 minutes to the restaurant many times - sometimes in horrible traffic, which adds another 15 or so minutes. However, I no longer feel it's worth it.  It's all American food, so there are lots of other choices closer to home. Hopefully they just have a bad management team and will soon change out, so things can get better again.

The last couple of times I've swung by, I've gone straight to the bar area and ordered there.  The bartender is usually busy with multiple customers, but is quick to take care of everyone.  They're always friendly, and service is usually quick.  The only knock on this place is that they seem to serve a smaller amount of fries every time I come.  I mean, I get that it's unlimited and I can get more, but why use that as an excuse to serve me less up front?

And I can still walk in 10 minutes before closing and they will still cheerfully seat me and serve me (to the extent the kitchen is open). Then tragedy strikes! (sort of). Turns out the food allergy that I suspected was to dairy turns out to be (dum dum dum) to gluten. The good news is I can eat ice cream! The bad news is, well, will I ever be able to eat out again? Can I haz Cheezburger? Then I read not only does RR have a gluten free bun, it's the best gluten free bun on the planet! And since their burgers are already par excellence, off we go to RR.
