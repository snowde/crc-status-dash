Neither of those came out with the meal. 5.  I ordered the fish and chips. Don't order fish at a place that specializes in burgers.  My mistake for sure. Chips (French Fries) were cool, barely warm. 6.  Eight minutes after our food arrived and the pizza had not arrived, I called over the manager and told him what had transpired up to this point. Was very apologetic; brought out hot fries, my Grandson's pizza and the requested sauces.  7.  Asked for fries when we ordered our drinks. Waitress said that the kitchen was very busy and that they might not be able to get us any.  Fries did show up about 15 minutes later.

32,Karen E.,"Atlanta, GA",5,2,,2.0,2015-02-03,"I'm here to talk about the fries, and the service, and the serving of the fries. See, when you order a burger at this joint, it's supposed to come with ""endless"" fries.  So, reasonably enough, plates are delivered with about four fries in a little cone.  Okay, it's more than four, but it's about 1/10 of a serving at any other restaurant. That wee tiny frycone, and the chain's proud espousal of endless fries, might give you the impression that more fries are forthcoming.  I've eaten at the Bridge Street Red Robin three times now, and I can testify that there will _not_ be more fries. I actually don't even care that much for fries in general, but they're a good test of the cheerfully negligent service at this location.  Want more of your side dish?  Too bad.  Need a refill because the waiter filled your first glass with ice?  He'll be back with it ... long after you've lost your appetite.  Want one of the special sauces so proudly advertised on the menu?  Oops, he forgot to bring that.  He'll get it for you...never. If you can handle the service, the food is okay.  The buttery, brioche-like buns are good.  The burgers and sides are prepared consistently, though a lot of the menu items are so overwrought that they're kind of boring.  So yeah, not my favorite place.  I'd like to say that I could see going there for a low-key dinner after a movie, but I honestly wouldn't do that.  I'd rather have no service than bad service, so I'd probably end up at Five Guys where I can get my own damned water.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-huntsville?start=20,3.72,3.72,3.72,2.536,3.7200000000000006

19,Blanca E.,"Madison, AL",1862,128,1905.0,4.0,2016-04-20,"East Meets South Meets Yummy w the new Red Ramen Burger for my tummy! ;P  While I may not usually care for a burger (unless it's In-N-Out), I always support my hubby's cravings for them.  Yesterday afternoon we did just so. LOCATION & PARKING 5/5 Located conveniently within Bridge Street Town Center on the far end toward Monaco but just after Belk, you'll have many nearby parking spots to choose from under the shade of the somewhat new parking structure or out in the open.  Either one you choose would be a short walk to the restaurant which can be seen nearby.     ATMOSPHERE & AMBIANCE 4/5 What can you expect from a Red Robins?  Well this location sports some interesting pieces on the wall.  I especially like what they have on the far back wall, particularly the multiple colored baseballs designed to resemble the American flag, the 12-inch LP records placed together as Bob Marley's afro, and the set of PacMan art pieces made out of rubik's cubes.  It's definitely a family friendly environment with many tables and booths.  Depending on the time you come, you can hold a small lunch meeting in the back section w a few co-workers over a late bite and miss the crowd and to have some privacy w/o being concerned of anyone eavesdropping.  This was about the time we arrived yesterday.  So it wasn't crazy busy and we could actually hear each other. During busy lunch and dinner times, expect otherwise.     SERVICE 4/5 Yesterday's service w Jeremy and new trainee Josh (I think that's what his name was) was by far better than prior visits we've experienced.  These guys were attentive yet not overbearing, knowledgeable and quick to answer our questions on specific menu items, and patient and genuinely kind.  The southern accent was a nice touch too. 8)  Even the server was fun and outgoing.  Prior visits were the total opposite in that we didn't even see our waitress from taking our order until they assumed we were done w our meal and attempted to bring up our bill total on the table device.  Anyways, we were happy with the recent visit.  Just wish our experience would be consistently good in all our visits (and there aren't that many since).  That's one of the reasons why we don't frequent this establishment often as we do others.     FOOD 4.5/5 Hubby ordered the delicious FIERY GHOST TAVERN BURGER.  If you like a nice kick to your bite that lasts beyond it, this is the one to consider.  I daringly tasted it and it was worthy of two more bites.  Haha.  ;P  Each bite screamed deliciousness w the ghost pepper sauce running off the side and a nice kick from the fried jalapeños.  Hubby enjoyed his burger to completion, along with the bottomless fries that came with it. I ordered & devoured the RED RAMEN BURGER.  Yes, you read that correctly! NOODLES, baby!!  We didn't have to drive all the way back to California to get a ramen burger cause they offer it here!   Lol.  And if you know me for any length of time, I'd choose noodles (lo mein or pansit) over rice any day... everyday!  [Rice, as w most Filipinos, is a staple when I cook at home.]  You can imagine I was indeed delighted to see this as a menu item, and of all places, here @ RR.  And so that's exactly what I ordered.  The bun was made out of seasoned ramen noodles pressed and fried together!  Every bite had a nice crunch to it. #nomnom  And since I don't like getting messy when I eat, I used a knife and fork AND a spoon to eat this ramen burger!  Haha.  [Yes, I do this w pizza too.]  There were two tantalizingly delish sauces that brought out the flavors in this burger - teriyaki and something they call chiu chow aioli.  Both satiated my taste buds.  We actually requested they bring out extra sauces, but not cause the burger needed it, but so we could dip our fries into them!  They were that good!  Inside this ramen burger came a medley of chili-infused shredded cabbage, sliced red onions, thinly sliced carrots, fresh basil and a few fried jalapeños which made for a nice kick.  It's simply worth a try and you'll sure to have a party in your mouth too! ;D  But don't wait too long to go.  Sadly, the ramen burger is being offered for limited time.  Go there now! ;D     VERDICT & RETURN 4/5 This recent visit redeemed prior visits.  And so long as they're serving the Red Ramen Burger and hubby continues to crave burgers, we'll likely not wait another 6 months before coming back. ;D  Check them out for yourself and do try the Red Ramen Burger!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-huntsville,3.52,3.52,3.52,2.6079999999999997,3.5200000000000005

The first problem we ran into was at the hostess stand, where no one was waiting and no one arrived to help for around 5 minutes. It was also noticeably messy.  After sitting in our booth for 15 minutes or so, we couldn't get anyone to serve us. We ended up leaving since we couldn't even get water. There seemed to be plenty of staff running around, but they all ignored us. We even had the last luck to be seated near the apparent ""staff area"" where they all sat or stood around eating and talking while we waited...and waited.  On our way out I stopped (and again waited for the hostess to arrive) so I could let her know. I told her that no one was there to serve us. Her response, instead of apologizing or asking if she could do anything or even get the manager, was ""Okay. Have a nice day.""  Completely disappointed, we went and spent our money elsewhere.

I dont think I will be going back any time soon, it gets old. You are packed in the building like sardines, its very loud at times and can be difficult to hold a conversation, and I find that they are very stingy with the bottomless fries. You basically get one refill if you ask for it and its a very small portion. Sometimes the waiters are good and sometimes they look like they hate their job. Fries are good but nothing special, burgers are just ok, but their chocolate ice cream cake is AMAZING and can be shared between 2-3 people. Overall, the food just isnt worth the wait or the noise and you may walk away still hungry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-huntsville?start=20,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006

She half way named out a plate and when I asked if it was ""full plate name"" she smarted off and replied, ""yeah, that's what I said"" then proceeded to shove it in my face but politely set down all the others. Had I gotten her name I would have handled this in the restaurant but unfortunately I did not see her the rest of the evening.

5,Bill B.,"Madison, AL",1939,478,1562.0,4.0,2017-02-28,"I visited the Red Robin at Bridge Street on 2/27 for lunch. Red Robin has a vast, but confusing, burger menu. So many options at many different price-points! After some research I found the Smoky Jack Tavern burger for only $6.99. I ordered the Smoky Jack and fries. I sat at the bar and was waited on by lovely Paula. She was very attentive and helped my with the kiosk ordering machine. The kiosk at my bar location didn't work so she took care of my order and checkout. The burger was very good and the endless fries is a nice option. I really like their fries and I always place extra Red Robin Signature Blend seasoning on the burger and fries. The burger, fries, and service were excellent.  My ticket before tip was $10.88.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-huntsville,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96

The bun is smaller and it has two thin patties with American cheese and apraxia tavern sauce.

We were warned at the front door they could not serve grilled chicken or burgers, not 100% sure what that was about (possibly a grill down or something), BUT the staff stayed very positive about it, let us know right away in case we wanted to choose a new venue, and were wonderful hosts. We sat at the bar, had amazing service, and the appetizers we ordered were delicious. Spinach and Artichoke dip was great (definitely could have used more chips), and my friend got boneless wings and ate every one of them.

I have no idea what has happen to this place but the product is horrendous. I can't stand going to a restaurant that specializes in something (in this case burgers) and failing miserably. I myself could care less about bottomless fries when all I wanted was a ""descent"" burger. I didn't expect anything spectacular, but I'm pretty sure I could have gotten the same quality burger at gas station. Yep, I said it. It's been 3 years since I've dined at a RR, and after tonight, it is clear that it will be my last. 2 stars for our server Paula who was a sweetheart and for my nephew's Boca burger that you can get in any grocery store and cook it in a toaster oven that made him happy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-huntsville,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76

I splurged and had the DGB, a burger topped with oven roasted tomatoes (tasted more like sun dried), arugula, and garlic aioli and served on a ciabatta roll. The combinations of flavors was wonderful! Unfortunately the ciabatta didn't hold up to the aioli, and I ended up eating it with a fork. The fries were fresh and hot, and I topped them with the house seasoning on the table.

8,C. M. F.,"Madison, AL",8,209,41.0,1.0,2017-11-20,"This was to be a come back tour since our last visit in November 2014. Unfortunately this place has continued to auger into the ground. The entire visit was marginally acceptable at best. The current hygienic qualities though were horrific. I went to grind some pepper on my burger and the inside portion of the grinder had unidentifiable food stuffs stuck to the inside portion of the grinder. Yes stuck, as if it had been there for some time. Who are you going to believe me or your lying eyes? The onion rings were great, but hey anything fried is good, right? The waitress acted like it was her first day, serving people that sat down after we did, and generally being uninterested in providing service. We tipped her 20% anyway because it really appeared like she was new to this line of work. I did bring this up to the manager AFTER we paid because I did not want her to think that we were trying to milk them for a comp'ed meal. Her response really floored us both, ""well next time you come in my name is..."" are you kidding me? Her response should have been, ""I'm so sorry, we will correct this immediately and let me refund you your meal."" All we wanted was a clean atmosphere and decent food. Well we did not get it. As such, I for one WILL BE HAVE TO BE EXTREMELY HARD PRESSED to ever set foot inside of this rat trap restaurant again and recommend you don't either. If the things that are visible to customers out front are nasty, you can only imagine what goes on in the back that you don't see. Plenty of other eating establishments are available.

Next thing I notice is people are walking in and being seated and we are still waiting. The male hostess seemed distraught with his job and blamed the manager. We were then seated right past the hostess desk, surrounded by dirty tables full of dishes that were all still there when we left the restaurant. It did not seem that a server was even assigned our table as we again waited. Our server seemed very overworked/rushed as we become the invisible table. We used the call server button for our table and the two nasty tables around us in an attempt to get service while workers continued to walk past us. As we were leaving we talked to other guests who had the same problem and was told management had changed. From my perspective,it needs to change again!
