85,Brandi F.,"Arlington, TX",1,30,1.0,4.0,2012-01-27,Ate there last night. I had the gourmet cheeseburger & my other had the bacon cheeseburger. Both were delicious. Enjoyed the bottomless fries. Definately will go again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hurst?start=100,3.12,3.12,3.12,3.12,3.1200000000000006
76,Dash W.,"Keller, TX",162,23,3.0,2.0,2012-03-21,"So me and my family decide that it would be best to celebrate my husband and his brothers birthday dinner at Red Robin in Hurst, TX. We had a rather large group consisting of parents, 3 children, spouses, making for a pretty large order. The service was wonderful with accommodating to us and the waiter we had was perfect. So where did things go wrong? The food.  Bland bland bland.  First off, my husband and I are on a low carb, low sugar diet. Red Robin claims it's a great place to get a menu that caters to that. Well, actually they did. I ordered the chicken caprese, and hubby went and ordered the Royal Red Robin burger with steamed broccoli, and no bun .  The Royal Red Robin came out and the burger was bland with zero seasoning, and rubber-like. The egg that was supposed to be on it was also overcooked rubber with also zero seasoning. The broccoli was hardly steamed, and once again, plain as could be.  Mine was an interesting idea, with large pieces of mozzarella slices, a Caesar like salad with fried pepperoni, and chicken that had been grilled with a pico topping.  The mozzarella had some sort of broun sauce on it, but once again no flavor. The cheese itself also (I don't know how) also had no flavor. The salad was overdressed with dressing which was a typical Caesar dressing, pepperoni chips were over-fried, and the chicken was burnt horribly. The burn flavor went and made itself the star of the dish with its horrific flavor, and ZERO seasoning. Even the pico was bland and I think did not have cilantro even in it.  With kids constantly bugging on me, and parents talking non-stop, me and the husband tried to be nice and not cause a scene, (since his parents are very easily upset by things like this) and tried to eat what we had. I of course was starving since I had not eaten all day and tried to at least go with having half.  I noticed the kids and rest of the family only ate about half of their meals too, and I'm sure that like us, the brother and his wife were also unhappy with the food. (kids didnt even take but one bite of their food)  So that's it really. Horribly bland food, but wonderful service. The waiter we had was friendly, and always refilling drinks, checking on us.  Sad thing is I was up sick all night after eating there. :( Something is going on in that kitchen that is all wrong!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hurst?start=80,2.8880000000000003,2.8880000000000003,2.8880000000000003,2.8880000000000003,2.888000000000001
88,Tara B.,"Plano, TX",28,56,,3.0,2012-03-26,"I'm only giving this location a 3 because the food is pretty good consistently.  The service however is another story.  My friends and I eat here more than I care to admit as a go to place for a decent burger and fries and we normally don't have any issues. Our visit tonight was quite another story.   We were greeted fairly quickly and sat at about 9pm on Sunday night.  The waiter came by slowly and got our drink orders but didn't give us a chance to order appetizers nor did he ask.  He brought the drinks and left quickly and came back probably 7 to 10 minutes later to take our order.  Our food came out pretty quickly by another waitress.  I had the wrappin California club and it was not made correctly it came out with just turkey, lettuce and avocado.  We told the waitress it was wrong and initially she tried to argue but then agreed and took it back for correction.  5 to 7 minutes later my wrap returned....for a wrap that wasn't even hot..there is no reason it should have taken that long for correction.  Our waiter finally returned several minutes later and asked the customary ""how's your food?"" but again didn't wait long enough for us to answer.  So we ate and the food was good, before we were all finished the waiter came with the check and said ""no rush"" and boy did he mean that.  We all finished up and sat there for another 10 minutes or so without even seeing the waiter.  It appeared that he was also waiting on a  larger table and the other 3 or 4 servers were busy cleaning for closing and couldn't be bothered with customers.  Our waiter appeared but didn't make it to our table so I went to the bar to get someone there to cash us out and found the manager.  He apologized and brought the completed check back to the table.  While waiting on the manger to return the waiter finally came by and asked about the check and we told him I had taken to the manager and he said .. "" ok cool""!  Not I'm sorry but ok cool...well there was nothing cool about it.   To top it off when the manager dropped off the check he didn't ask how the experience was or the service 9or the food, just apologized again for the delay and walked away.   Luckily we got a survey with the check so they will be getting this earful as well.  Very disappointing experience.  We will go back but it will be awhile and we will probably go to grapevine location instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hurst?start=100,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004
32,Jennifer W.,"Fort Worth, TX",101,77,4.0,4.0,2012-06-19,"Red Robin is one of those solid places, you know you'll get good (albeit not-good-for-you) food at a somewhat overpriced rate. That being said, it's reliable with regard to portion sizes, service and speed. It isn't a quick place, but it's certainly reasonable. I will say that around holidays, this particular location get's more than it's fair share of business (especially during lunch!).  Try the Lone Star Burger. It's messy. It's huge.

I ordered the A1 Peppercorn burger and loved every bite of it. It was juicy, came on an onion bun and the cheese was well melted. The peppercorn sauce was tangy and had a bit of a pepper bite. I love the fact that the steak fries are bottomless. They are good steak fries, especially if you sprinkle the house seasoning on them. We sat at the bar, had a good meal and the bartender/waiter was easy to get along with. He constantly kept my water filled, as I had a hoppy beer to balance the tang of the burger, and it worked out well.

66,Haley K.,"North Richland Hills, TX",68,530,74.0,4.0,2012-10-15,"We really like red robin, its one of the major chains that I really don't mind going to a lot. They have salads and such and well of course a lot of ""cheating on your diet"" food. The prices are about what you would expect out of a chain but they have a lot of coupons, deals and other such options out there. (Press pass, mailer coupons, etc.) We joined their royal red program they have which earns you free food and so on. On a plus side the kroger next to our house carries red robin gift cards so we pick on up before we go to eat there to get the gas reward points as well. So we end up coming here as a fail safe. This is the location is the closest to our home; and the staff has always been nice and timely with our food. The food is always really good, and of course with big eaters in my family the endless fries are a plus. Thank goodness they are steak fries, I like the bigger fries not the small stringy fries.

Jay ordered the whiskey river bbq burger and fries.  He ate every bit and even got a refill on fries.  For $10, I think it's a little steep but maybe I am just out of touch with the gourmet burger scene. I ordered the Ensenada chicken platter, which is two small chicken breasts and a salad.  Food tasted good and I had plenty to take home.  Again, $12.50 seems high for the amount of food received.

46,Lauren M.,"Denver, CO",557,124,154.0,3.0,2014-10-11,"Tonight I tried some new things on the menu! My boyfriend ordered us an appetizer of fried zucchini and cheese sticks. This was some of the best fried zucchini I've ever had, although it was SUPER HOT. Be careful.  My usual burger is the bleu ribbon with a turkey patty and garlic aioli instead of the chipotle. It's so freaking good. The fried onions and onion bun are just amazing. I forgot to order sweet potato fries, but I usually get those and they have some pretty good ones albeit sometimes a bit soggy.  The reason I'm giving it 3 stars is simply because it would appear this location is being managed very poorly, Hosts are just sitting around and I've heard from past employees that this lazy attitude is due to people essentially ""giving up"", because their GM is awful. This trickles down and sometimes, in past experiences, has affected service and food quality.

This was not fast food, but an establishment with hosts, servers, and a bar.  Everything started off wonderfully, with a cheerful host leading us to a table that was clean, with full condiments, and not placed too near any particularly loud or boisterous groups.  Our server arrived at the table in a few moments, took our drink order, and upon returning, was ready to take our food order.  We had promised to bring something back for the Mother-in-Law, and I notified the server at that time that we'd be needing it to go, after we were through with our meal.  Most of the meal passed smoothly, as expected (the food was great), until the server brought a refill of the bottomless steak fries the restaurant is famous for.  He set the puny basket on the table, and informed us that our to-go order was almost ready.  WAIT.  Hold up...  almost ready?  I'm still working on my meal.  It's Valentine's Day, and I'm out to celebrate!  We walked in the door less than 30 minutes ago, and you're, in effect, rushing me out again already?  What if I wanted more fries?  I just got off of a 9-hour shift at work.  I'm hungry.  What if we wanted dessert?  Or a drink?  Now I have hot food on its way to the table, ready to take home for someone else.  You have cut my evening short, and stopped my check at its current total.  The $41 total could have been 56, for which I'd have tipped you around $12-15.  Instead, you got 6.  The lesson here...  ask before sending that order to the kitchen.  Don't rush me through my meal.  I understand turning over tables, but you had two empty.  It wouldn't have killed you to allow us to set the pace.  It's something I learned in my first day of training.  Apply it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-hurst?start=100,3.56,3.56,3.56,3.3040000000000003,3.5600000000000005

Allergic to mayo, so you need a different sauce instead? That'll be $0.75. (It's about the principal) Now, I'm not allergic to mayo but you get my point. They literally state on the menu an example like this one. I understand charging to substitute fries with onion rings, but a sauce? Really? Despite the above, I did like the food. The burger (double patty tavern burger) I had WAS GOOD and had PLENTY OF CHEESE. The steak fries here were excellent, but also MIA. I equate this place to a more expensive Steak N Shake.

Then after another 10 minutes, we had to go get the hostess again and ask who our waiter was, because they were yet to come to our table. By the time he came, we were ready to place our order. We then waited another 20 minutes to receive our food. The waiter also never came back to check on us throughout this time. We then received our burgers.

The good thing is that the manager brought the new burger out, and surprisingly the service improved. We received fresh fries, the burger was cooked great, and the waiter attended to us more.

Ok... fine, she's busy. There was a server just standing at the host stand leaning on it, doing absolutely NOTHING who didn't smile, or utter a single word to us. I waited tables for FAR too long to excuse this blatant neglect in the service industry. If you're a hostess,  & you're busy seating other guests, look to the folks who walk in, & say SOMETHING! ""I'll be with you in a moment"" works just fine. If you're a server at the front, & you've got nothing better to do, seat tables, or at least GREET them.

For one thing, I am apparently not the brightest, because I didn't realize that aioli = mayonnaise. I'm not a fan of dipping fries in mayo, so that's probably my mistake. I also didn't really enjoy being charged extra for gross mayo that I didn't even use (only 75 cents, but still, it's the principle.)  The atmosphere was kind of loud, like a sports bar. Our server was friendly enough but she told us some gross story about eating until you puke, so you can then go back and eat more. The burger and fries were fine, but not memorable enough in contrast to being charged for flavored mayo to dip my fries in and a server with unpleasant and inappropriate conversation.
