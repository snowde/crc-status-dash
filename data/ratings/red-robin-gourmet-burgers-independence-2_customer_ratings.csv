12,M F.,"Sturgis, SD",24,33,16.0,4.0,2012-04-24,"I went to this Red Robin to celebrate my birthday burger last week-end with my husband. This was our first time at this location, but have eaten at many other Red Robin Restaurants and have always loved them. I ordered mushrooms on my bacon cheese burger and we both asked for no salt on our fries. My husband ordered fish and chips and said the fish was some of the best he has ever had. A girl brought our burgers out and my burger did not have mushrooms and we had salt on our fries. By the time our waiter, Zane, finally got back to our table, we were without water. I also wanted mustard for my burger and I explained I didn't get any mushrooms on my burger. I had already eaten almost all of my burger since it had been so long. He did not apologize, nor did he get any mushrooms for me. He did not ask if we wanted refills on our water or fries. We noticed other people sitting and waiting as well. Our waiter, Zane, did not even acknowledge my birthday or ask if we wanted dessert, just brought us our check. This is the worst service we have ever had at any restaurant. Needless to say, we did not leave him a tip. In our opinion, tips are EARNED, not mandatory. I spent a few years as a waitress and I know what good service is, and Zane should not be a waiter! And, what do you know, today we look at our debit card bill, and see that Zane took it upon himself to give himself a tip and changed the tip amount to $5.00! I have my receipt showing the original charge and our copy showing no tip. This is UNACCEPTABLE! He should be fired. This is stealing and should not be tolerated! Update: I contacted the MGR, Michael Price at this location. He refunded the full amount back to my card and took my address to send us a gift card in hopes we will come back to Red Robin. We really appreciate this and will consider going back, only if Zane is not our waiter. Follow up: After several calls over two weeks, we finally got a $20 credit the manager said he would apply back to our credit card. He also sent a $50 gift card for our trouble after we reminded him twice that we did not receive it. He said it just got misplaced on his desk. We ate there again twice, and did not see Zane, the waiter. Apparently, he was let go, or he was not working when we were there. The food both times was exceptional, especially the fish and chips. Our waiter on the last visit (guy with dark hair and glasses) was the best ever, and he said he was working a double shift that day. We will definitely go back now and changed our rating from a 1* to a 4*.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-independence-2?start=40,3.3120000000000003,3.3120000000000003,3.3120000000000003,3.3120000000000003,3.3120000000000003
31,Grace T.,"Charleston, SC",26,130,29.0,5.0,2012-06-21,"I think this place is the first place that comes to mind when I think of hamburger places to recommend. I think what makes this place special is that each of their burgers really do have their own distinct, unique taste. I like Chili's bacon cheeseburger and Five Guys's little bacon cheeseburger, but I think this place really makes the flavors that should be in a great burger merry well. I'm a big fan, and I would definitely come back for their A1 Peppercorn burger. Oh, and did I mention that they have bottomless steak fries with their burgers?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-independence-2?start=20,3.3160000000000003,3.3160000000000003,3.3160000000000003,3.3160000000000003,3.3160000000000007

18,Rhonda S.,"Independence, MO",786,1010,914.0,4.0,2012-12-21,"I had a craving for a good cheeseburger, with French fries. I wanted a milk shake to go along with that. Other fast food places wouldn't do the trick. I decided to stop in at Red Robins.It's been years since I ate there. We arrived around 3:40, before the crowd. The place is often too crowded for me to consider. Besides I'm not a $9.00 cheeseburger person, hardly ever. We had Sally for our server, and she was witty, and helpful. I immediately said the salted caramel shake, and ordered it, on account of her suggesting it.   I also ordered a mushroom Swiss burger with endless french fries. I ordered it medium well. My mom ordered a Bleu burger with honey melons. When our order arrived, the sides were switched, but it was quickly corrected. My mushroom Swiss burger was thick with mushrooms, and a burger so large I could hardly get it into my mouth. I chose an onion bun. The Swiss cheese was also thick, and I could make strings across the table...that's bad manners, but anyway, it was delicious. The fires, I couldn't get through the first plate, much less take advantage of endless fries.  The fries were just fries, I sprinkled seasoning salt on them, and that really made them pop.  The salted caramel shake..Oh my...porn in a glass. On the picture they had caramel topping drizzled on the whipped cream topping, mine just had a pretzel topping. I think they forgot the caramel drizzle. It was delicious. Sally double checked to see if I liked it. She got a thumbs up from me. I think Red Robin is over priced, the $9.00 cheeseburger with a shake can add up. That is why I knocked them down a star. They are closer to 5 stars than 4.  Very cool interior with tons of decorations, and lights. On the menu, they will sub a veggie burger or Bocca for no extra price addition. I won't eat here too often, the price makes that not an every day visit, or even every month. But it's worth stopping if if a really good cheeseburger and shake are craved.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-independence-2?start=20,3.3120000000000003,3.3120000000000003,3.3120000000000003,3.3120000000000003,3.3120000000000003
6,Heather Anne B.,"Columbia, MO",12,222,,3.0,2013-05-12,"I really love Red Robin! My mom and I came here for a laid-back mother's day dinner and we got a table right away. We got some onion rings to start and they were delicious as always, but the burgers are why people come here. Their gardenburger is one of the best veggie burgers I've ever eaten. It comes with this tasty dijon sauce that I can't get enough of, and even though it's free to substitute any regular burger with a veggie patty, as far as I'm concerned I have found my go-to meal here. The fries are delicious and bottomless, but the servings are so generous that I never have room for a refill. But the service was poor and by the time we left, we were actually pretty frustrated. We were seated at a tiny two-person booth and nothing was cleared off. We simply didn't have enough room. Our onion ring tower sat in the middle of the table even though we finished it long before our burgers arrived, and our server dropped off refills without taking the empties. Maybe that's okay at a larger table but after three refills that meant five cups on the table meant for just two people. In general the service was also quite slow. We needed napkins but they didn't come until after we finished eating, and it was still several minutes more before we got the check. As a general rule, diners should NEVER have to ask for napkins, especially at a place that serves greasy burgers and fries -- those should be available at all tables from the start. Isn't that just common sense? Serving tasty food is only half the battle, Red Robin! Get it together and I'll bet you'll have many more happy customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-independence-2?start=40,3.2120000000000006,3.2120000000000006,3.2120000000000006,3.2120000000000006,3.212000000000001

I should have asked to have the lettuce and tomato replaced with pickles and onions but that's my fault. The fries are a letdown here. Even though they're all you can eat they're frozen and fried in vegetable oil.

Had games, trivia etc.  they have recently updated the inside and did a great job.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-independence-2,3.64,3.64,3.64,,3.6400000000000006
19,Renee W.,"Independence, MO",9,36,1.0,1.0,2016-10-18,"I came here for lunch with my dad last Friday. We asked to start off with fries while we chose our entrees. What we got was a pitiful side of fries that had maybe 8 fries. They were beyond cold, even though the restaurant was packed, which was nothing short of bizarre. If Red Robin cannot even get the fries right, why eat here? We walked out and told the manager why and didn't really get much of a response or remedy except that he offered to get us different fries. We weren't in the mood for an argument so we just walked out and went to Thai Spice across the street. I am so disappointed because I am craving a good bleu ribbon burger and HOT fries, but I know Red Robin just isn't capable of living up to this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-independence-2?start=20,3.56,3.56,3.56,,3.5600000000000005

Someone else brought our food, then nothing after that. No drink refills, we wanted shakes but no one came still. Luckily they have the pay at the table tablets or I fear we would have sat there all night. I paid and we walked out without being acknowledged.

42,Madeline H.,"Kansas City, MO",0,29,7.0,5.0,2016-12-13,"Came here awhile back. The food was ok. I had gotten fish and chips. I could not fully enjoy it as i could taste the grease which means A.) The oil was not at the right temp to properly fry or B.) They did not allow the grease to drain off the fish properly. Now the fish itself tasted good. Very flavorful. Their fries are delicious and seasoned well. Everyone else got burgers, which is really neat how you can customize you burger ANYWAY you want it, however, I would not spend nearly  $10+ on a personalized burger. I can easily get an equally delicious burger cheaper at Five Guys or Hi- Boy. Like I said the food was good, but at the end of it with everyone getting their entree and a couple of apps it was $70 not including tip. To me it's simply not worth paying that much  for a fine dining experience...for burgers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-independence-2,3.68,3.68,3.68,,3.6800000000000006

37,Anthony B.,"Blue Springs, MO",1,50,174.0,3.0,2017-03-02,"I go to the this restaurant fairly regularly as it's my children's favorite.  There has been a noticeable decline in quality of the service since they introduced the table top touchscreens.  On my last visit, I couldn't get my drink refilled even after pushing the call button for the server.  I eventually gave up, turned it off and my wife shared some of her water with me.  When my server did finally return, I asked for a refill and never got it.   While we chatted as our kids finished their food, we were reminded three times that our bill was ready, even thought we'd told the server that we were going to pay it on the table top touchscreen.   I'll still go back because we kids love the fries and campfire sauce.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-independence-2,3.52,3.52,3.52,,3.5200000000000005

Our waiter was enthusiastic and nice but he was the only waiter that didn't look completely miserable. but food was good. Just wish they would have given us more. I had a mac n cheese burger but the mac n cheese was really Just plain elbow noodles with a almost non existant amount of melted stringy cheese. Id say 3.5 out of 5. Music was good.

Food was really good, which we weren't 100% expecting. We ordered the onion ring tower (and as an onion ring fanatic, I would come back just for them! They were THAT good!!) and the campfire sauce and ranch were great with it. Avocado Chicken Wedgie was super tasty and wrapped in a huge lettuce leaf, which my wife loved. We also ordered burgers that were cooked perfectly as well as steak fries and sweet potato fries. All really good and hot from the kitchen, not limp or cold. +2 3. Manager came by and checked in on us which is always appreciated. +1 Solid 5/5, and this is so rare these days. We literally didn't have one complaint or issue.

51,M. M.,"Lee's Summit, MO",4,59,,3.0,2017-05-29,"Stopped by here Saturday with my husband for a quick bite for lunch and as always burgers and unlimited fries were very good. If it hadn't been for my husband pointing something out I wouldn't have noticed the discrepancy in the seating that afternoon. When he left to the restroom and came back he noticed how people who were 35 and younger and with/without children sat in the larger restaurant section. Those with someone with graying hair sat in the separate section near the bar, which was odd. I didn't believe him until I got up and looked around. Yes, all those with children sat in the larger section, but there were plenty of adults who did not have children and were seated with someone of younger than 35 or 40 age in that larger section. One or two people who seemed older who sat in that section had someone who seemed younger than 35. My husband unfortunately has that early gray gene so we sat in that sequestered area.

35,Lauryn W.,"Lee's Summit, MO",95,103,27.0,5.0,2017-11-13,"I usually don't rate chains as 5 stars, but I've always been a fan of Red Robin.  The restaurants I've been to are always clean, I've never had poor service or food errors, and everything I've ever ordered has been really satisfying.  We went to this location on Veteran's Day. Any veteran was gifted a free Tavern Burger and bottomless fries. No purchase necessary either. Even though the place was packed, we were sat quickly and efficiently. They didn't even ask us for military ID.  Our food was perfect. Nice experience as usual. It's not often you can find a place that always delivers, but Red Robin always has for me.  We had the free Tavern burger, and another custom burger. I love their fries and seasoning and they never let mine get empty.  I can't complain. We always go here if we are in the area.

Our burgers weren't cooked right, mine was burnt so bad I couldn't take more than 2 bites.  I ordered the tower of onion rings and it was cold.  And the service was sub par at best because they were sooooo understaffed.  I think our waitress had the whole middle of the restaurant.  Oooh and the ketchups are all empty no doubt everyone tried to use them to wash down the horrible food.  Our neighboring tables both asked us is we had ketchup because they were out as well.  Don't get me started on bathrooms I almost walked across the road to QuickTrip to pee!  They were the most disgusting smelling, no toilet paper, and lucky me I had a used tampon on the floor of my stall.  My entire group is nervous now that they will end up sick from what little they ate because cleanliness is obviously not a priority for this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-independence-2,3.72,3.72,3.72,,3.7200000000000006
