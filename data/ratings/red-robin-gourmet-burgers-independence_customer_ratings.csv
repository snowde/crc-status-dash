50,Richard H.,"Hinckley, OH",172,230,181.0,4.0,2012-02-27,"Did you just call me Peaches? I went here with my kids the other day and I am pretty sure the male server called me Peaches.. Which still has me a little miffed. Maybe i heard wrong, but it sure sounded like it. Anyway.. Red Robin is great for kids. They have an awesome kids menu and my boys always find something they really like. I am in love with the Whiskey River BBQ Chicken sandwich. The bottomless fries thing is nice, but i have never actually refilled them, because i am stuffed by the time i am done.  The dining room is always busy and has plenty of stuff to look at. Usually very clean and I usually get pretty decent service. You have to remember when going here that you are going to an upscale McDonalds.. This isn't a date restaurant unless you are 13. If you don't have kids, this probably shouldn't be your first choice. They try to adult it up a little with the bar and foo foo drinks but in the end.. this is a kid restaurant that allows adults.  If you asked my kids, this would be a five star.. however i still dont know how these people sleep at night charging as much as they do for sandwiches. I think that most of the 2 star and under reviews are people who have a higher expectation than I did.. If you are looking for an exceptional burger or meal, than go somewhere else.. This place was was invented to cater to kids.

Sign up for there email list and you can get the free burger to. They don't send tons of emails so don't worry about the spam.

From entering the restaurant at 515 when it was 3/4ths empty: 4 employees sitting around at the hostess station, i was the only group needing seated, yet we wait there circa 5 minutes because ""everyone is on break and noone can clean the table."" Hmm, is this a union factory and only a busser can clean up? Get off your fat fn as&s and get a table fn ready. Omfg.  Number of F's given between these 4 fantastic employees: Zero. Ordering... Took a while to get our order, 35 min, despite half empty store.  Asked server to bring an extra fries with dinner, but of course these came out two minutes later.....cold. Nice.  At least the burgers were good and cooked properly..medium was actually medium.  And of course, the fries that came with dinner were also cold. Helpful reminder to red robin mgt: essentially you need to do three things well: get me seated, make a good burger, and provide hot french fries.  Fail on 2 of 3 of the above. I expect a lot more for a 13.49 burger, especially with melt next door.  Not sure I would be back to this location.

54,Aaron Y.,"Hartville, OH",5,24,17.0,2.0,2014-05-27,"I give one star to my waitress and the other star to the food.  My waitress was very responsive and friendly while the food came out quickly and was very tasty.  Now, with that being said I'm taking two stars away for cleanliness and one additional star for value.   With regard to cleanliness, our menu had a large hair stuck to some type of greasy substance.  Both the menus we were given felt like they hadn't been cleaned in some time.  They were straight up nasty and should be cleaned daily and as needed.  Also, the laminated drink flier on our table had a large smear of ketchup on it.  The next cleanliness item my son pointed out to me was that our table had several pieces of gum affixed to the underside.   Also, when we looked at the window sill that set against our table there was old food particles all along the length of the window.  The table also had a greasy/grimy feel to it, I believe the table finish could be the the culprit mixed with whatever cleaning chemical they use and when they combine the two there's a sticky feel to the table.  In sum, with regard to cleanliness the managers at Red Robin Independence fail to hold their staff to cleanliness standards and ensure that front of house tasks are completed on a daily basis.  There's no reason these managers can't hold their employees accountable especially when staff seem to have time on their hands as they converse in the bar area (not all the staff were lounging, just a few).  Instead of lounging they could be cleaning menus, tables, and the floor.  My last star being taken away is for ""value"", I had $30 tied up in two burgers, fries, diet cokes, and a tip.   The burger was better than a whopper and Big Mac (I like both); however, the fries were equal to fries at McDonald's and Burger King.  Thus, I'm left paying three times as much for a slightly better product in a store that has cleanliness .  Not a great value...my recommendation is to hit a fast food burger chain and skip Red Robin independence until they get the cleanliness fixed so their ""atmosphere"" can show value for their products, that's the only way they can improve unless they reduce prices to match their lethargy for cleanliness.  Best of luck Red Robin Independence, I could tell there were some good people there...you guys just need a good leader...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-independence?start=40,2.88,2.88,2.88,1.9920000000000002,2.88

Our last experience was definitely a 5 STAR visit but I wanted to take into account my last several visits. I ordered my usual Whiskey River BBQ burger which is a personal fav, requested as pink as possible. This request is typically difficult to please for me and the burgers come out dry as well as the burgers brought over to the table looking like they were just thrown together. That was not the case. The burger came pink, perfect, and had a high-end restaurant appeal to the presentation of the plate. It was extremely pleasing to see this was the case for all dishes brought out to the other tables. The service was quick and our waiter was extremely courteous as he was also a Purple Heart veteran who was medically discharged. Kudos to you and thank you for your service.

15,C. N.,"Cleveland, OH",0,42,4.0,3.0,2017-04-03,"The old Red Robin set-up was great, but things have unfortunately changed for the worse since it opened. Their burgers used to be served wrapped in paper, in a traditional burger joint red plastic basket with a healthy portion of the bottomless fries. Their plating has changed to more of a ""trendy"" style, with odd rectangular plates, and the bugers are no longer wrapped in paper for easy eating, the bottomless fries are now served in those silver metal rings, and it is a very small portion. They have also become very stingy about refilling the fries, and they take a long time, and arrive in very small amounts. The whole point of Red Robin was good, cheap burgers and fries served in large portions, and their freckled lemonade and desert drinks (mikshakes, root beer floats, etc...). They are now trying to cater to a slightly more upscale market, and they are kind of taking the fun out of Red Robin. It's supposed to be a family friendly burger joint, not a higher end chain restaurant, so they need to try to go back to trying to appeal to their old crowd. They also changed their decor a little bit, getting rid of the goofy robin statues and trying to make the restaurant more ""adult-like"", which was not a smart business decision. The place is meant to be a fun place for families, and the old decor fit that much better than the newer decor does. The food is still good, but they truly need to increase their portion sizes back to normal and go back to their roots as a family friendly burger joint if they want to see bigger crowds like they did back when they first opened. Granted, there wasn't as much competition on Rockside Road back then, but Red Robin can still be successful in this crowded marketplace if it goes back to standing out as something unique.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-independence,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16

I told him that he may want  to take a seat so I could tell him what I observed, but he seemed too busy to sit for a moment to listen to our poor experience.

0,Eric D.,"Kent, OH",116,106,97.0,4.0,2017-09-25,"The fact of the matter is that I do not like this location. I rather drive to North Olmsted where only once I was having an issue. This location has ruffled my drawers many times. The food is fine, but it is this guy named Chris and the last visit. Chris is always by the bar and I purposefully will move sections even if I have to wait when I see his mug. That being said, I have gone here many times and there is always something but rarely anything beyond a ruffling of my drawers. The last trip was good. Starting with Chris, I have this thing which I do not understand. They have a plethora of unlimited options. You can get the unlimited root beer floats, or lemonade, or a soda but that is not an 'and' aka you cannot substitute. So you better enjoy consuming a ton of ice cream if you start that way. To be honest, the location in North Olmsted never seemed to care if I wanted to have a float, then a tea, then a purple freckled lemonade or whatever it is called which is why I flock there. So Chris already ruined any whim of hope for a great Red Robin burger. Then I ordered the Garlic unlimited fries and when the time for a refill came it was you cannot switch, lets kill this fat kid's breathe so that the young lady he is with suffers like Chris's soul suffers when someone smiles. So I got pissed and I went outside and called corporate and found out that the sides CAN be switched but the drinks were not supposed to be. Okay. So the last trip, our waitress was cool and she said that since my dinner mate was getting fries that she would just bring out two so I can get broccoli and then have some fries. That is was cool and I tipped 25% because Nicol deserved it. However, the women that brought out the fries made a face when she dropped off two and saw my broccoli. You make-up laden charlatan, don't judge me. my turkey burger had TWO burgers, far as I am concerned I could have ordered several sides at once. If I wanted to be judged, I would call up my friends. Anyways, Nicol was really good but this Red Robin is just not as good as the one in North Olmsted. The problem of course is that I never drive and this one is a tinge closer to where I live and since I am not driving I cannot pick.  All-in-all I have never gotten the runs from their food but it would be nice to have some variety in life. If it is a matter of inventory or whatever, then make it so you can list a substitution and credit the orders. it cannot be that hard.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-independence,2.2,2.2,2.2,,2.2
