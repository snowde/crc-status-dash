30,Chrissy C.,"Carmel, IN",145,218,2666.0,5.0,2015-09-24,"When I think of Red Robin I think loud and crazy, but they also have fun burgers and nice salads. I also really like the chicken sandwiches and unlimited fries. It's not often you need or even want more fries, but I like that option. A friend told me that a new one was opening in Castleton and we were able to go to one of the preview days.  So this new layout was far from loud and crazy. This did seem like a smaller location and the first thing you see is the bar and it just has a classier look than it does or did at other locations. There are still 2 large eating areas. And maybe it's just me, but one side seemed more adult like with these cool red lights cascading down and the other side seemed more family/child decorated.  We got an order of the Banzai chicken wings and the sauce was really good. It also came with some pieces of grilled pineapple. I like boneless better since I made a huge mess eating them, but they were worth getting with that yummy sauce. This sauce is also on a burger so I will have to get it next time since I liked it so much.  To drink I went with the Freckled lemonade and it was really good. I usually skip lemonades since I always think they will be too sweet, but this was perfect and it came with strawberries. Honestly I am not sure I would normally get it since it's almost $5. But our waiter kept our glasses full the entire time.  I went with the Avo-Cobb-o salad with blue cheese dressing. It also came with some thin sliced garlic bread that seemed to be grilled. I really liked it. The chicken it came with was grilled really well too. I found my salad refreshing. I was also still able to sneak a few fries from my husband's plate. He had the Ensenada chicken platter and he was able to get fries instead of the salad and it was a huge amount of fries so he didn't need or even want more.  We were excited to try the new Red Robin. I am glad to see it looking a little more grownup, yet it still had the same tasty food. I love the menu has so many options. There really is something for everyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-indianapolis?start=20,2.644,2.644,2.644,2.644,2.644

He liked the salad, the soup (which I've ordered from other red robins) was the consistency of paste and was awful. Couldn't eat that.

31,Richard P.,"Indianapolis, IN",256,537,123.0,4.0,2015-10-22,"I returned to Red Robin Gourmet Burgers almost two weeks after my first visit as I was on that side of town and had a rare afternoon outside my usual office routine.  It is probably important to note that my visit was in mid-afternoon, well past the lunch hour and well before even the early dinner hours. Thus, my experience was almost destined to be considerably different than my last visit when it was incredibly packed.  As I entered Red Robin, I must say that I immediately experienced a different and improved vibe from my first visit. While they once again greeted me at the door, the atmosphere seemed calmer and it wasn't just because of having a smaller crowd.  First off, I'm not completely certain what was different but they'd clearly tweaked their design just a bit. I found myself wondering ""Did they read my review?"" While the right side still had its several rows of two-tops, which I'd still contend are decently sized two-tops, they also had a couple rows that were spaced out differently and it looked like the tables had been moved ever so slightly so that the aisles between the rows of tables left room for both walkers and wheelers. While I was placed at a four-top this time around, I found myself feeling fairly certain that I would be able to get out much easier this time around. So, whether or not this adjustment was triggered by my review, it was a definite plus.  Secondly, the dividing wall that I mentioned in my first review is now in place. It's actually a 1/2 wall done in a wooden theme that fits nicely with the restaurant's decor. It is my understanding that this was an Excise decision - they needed a better division between the bar and the family dining area. I understand it, and I think they've done it nicely, but it's kind of silly.  Most of what I wrote about Red Robin with my initial review remains true. The dividers on both sides of the restaurant being the key difference. I also noticed, much to my pleasure, that they'd added another accessible parking spot and it appeared they were even adding another one even as I was there. Excellent. Trisha was my server this time. She was on the money. She was friendly, helpful, timely, got me my iced tea refill and made sure I got a french fry refill. Today, I kept it very simple with a plain burger and fries along with my iced tea. It came in right around $12 plus tip. I will note that their ziosk payment system apparently wasn't working when I was there and, as well, I was disappointed that the reward club that I'd signed up for nearly two weeks ago apparently hadn't gotten into their system and if I want the meal added to my rewards I have to go to the inconvenience of actually calling them. I really think two weeks is long enough to get something into your system.  The hostess today was top notch. The server was terrific. The staff seemed calm and helpful. The entire atmosphere just felt more positive and enjoyable. Despite the busyness of the atmosphere, I really was able to sit there, read, and enjoy my meal.  So, it's with a smile on my face that I up the Red Robin rating to 4 stars. It seems like they're getting settled in and they're starting to work the bugs out of their system. While I can't fork over the 5th star, this was definitely a visit that made me want to return in the near future (and hopefully actually get my rewards).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-indianapolis?start=20,2.576,2.576,2.576,2.576,2.576
33,Jose C.,"Kansas City, MO",23,115,37.0,4.0,2015-11-01,"Pleasantly surprised, good burgers at a good value.  I stopped by a couple of times on my last trip to Indy, since it was walking distance from my hotel. I was a little skeptical since I'd never been to Red Robin before, but it was actually very good.  The setting is very familiar, just like most other bar and grill casual dining restaurants. Their menu is limited to burgers, but that should surprise no one as it's right on the side of the building ""gourmet burgers and brews"". Their burgers are actually pretty good, I tried of their smoke and pepper which was above average good, I had their bacon cheeseburger at another time and it was also good. I liked their fries, they are thicker than the average frie AND you get bottomless fries with your orders which means you can have all the fries you want!  I was in the mood for something sweet and ordered their cronuts, which were good, but their chocolate dipping sauce wasn't.  They also have a good selection of beers.  Service was very good, even that one night I came in 30 minutes before closing (I alway feel bad about getting to restaurants close to their closing time and expect staff to be tired and in a rush) they were very nice and attentive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-indianapolis?start=20,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.48
53,Christine M.,"Indianapolis, IN",127,304,1.0,2.0,2015-11-18,"I like the food at all Red Robins which is why I was happy to come here. I don't know if they had just opened or not, but it was bad news. First off, the place is way too small for the Castleton area. I'm used to them being much larger and with the mall and the hospital being so close, I would think this place would fill easily so why not make it bigger? Plus its the only place walking distance to the Drury. The waiter seemed like it was his first day ever waiting tables. He kept forgetting everything, straws, drinks, silverware. He put down the wrong sodas in front of us, and it's beyond me why he didn't just keep a wad of straws in his apron. They also only had beer and wine available and the waiter had not a single clue what was available at the bar. I went the healthier route with the tortilla soup and a southwest chicken wrap. He also forgot who ordered what, and forgot the ranch I requested. Seriously buddy, it's called a note pad, if you can't remember, write it down! If you need to go here, get takeout, otherwise the one off michigan road or in carmel at clay terrace is much better. I hope they get the kinks worked out. I try to give folks the benefit of the doubt as I've been there before but they weren't that busy and the service really missed the mark.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-indianapolis?start=40,2.184,2.184,2.184,2.184,2.184

19,Laquetta D.,"Indianapolis, IN",127,101,446.0,3.0,2016-02-07,"I had mixed feelings about checking out the latest addition to the Castleton area after reading some of the reviews but went for it anyway.  So after my visit, my verdict: Red Robin gets a 4-star rating for their food however only a 2-star for service bringing us to a 3.  Good stuff: You can't go wrong with 100% angus beef, cheddar cheese, maple-smoked bacon with a sweet slice of pineapple (talking about their Banzai burger) with their bottomless fries, however my experience tonight was quite disappointing. But we'll get to that later. We had our children with us and was concerned about their choices on the kids' menu; they didn't have appetizing looking choices. But I'm happy to say I was pleasantly surprised. Kids choice 1: Meatball lollipops (meatballs on skinny breadsticks) with cheese sauce very good....not plain American cheese, but a mix of what tastes like mozzarella and Swiss. Kids choice #2: cheeseburger and fries (really simple and good; and surprised they didn't charge for the extra requests of cheese and extra veggies). Kids choice #3: fish and chips: really good. (Yes I tasted their food, they eat mine so why not lol) I would like to go back and try their fish and chips. The cod wasn't what I thought it would be. It was very fresh and flavorful; not frozen and soggy like I had expected.  My sister from New England had not been to a Red Robin and I was craving a nice burger (been cutting back on meat but anyhoo) so we decided to check it out. We really enjoyed the food; whiskey BBQ burgers were a table fav and their wings were enjoyed. They have some dipping sauces that you can order for your fries or burgers. I tried the sweet Thai pepper sauce. It worked really well with my banzai burger.  Not so great: the service. The server was unattentive. Seemed like she had a lot going on with a only a handful of tables in the whole restaurant. She had every shorts answers and seemed like she didn't want our service.  I'll probably go again, but I try to avoid this particular server. Not every pleasant at all, kinda ruined the while experience for me. We left feeling like we weren't welcome.

I think this comes down to bad management. We used to like Red Robin, it's good for a chain place and we had positive experiences at locations in our old city.  However, the manager at this place was completely rude to a family sitting near us and clearly can't get his staff to do their jobs.

The waitress said it was for his next birthday not this one (which was that day), the Dad said that's not what the email said. She gets a manager, he comes out and implies it's not actually the man's birthday and demands to see his driver's license (I kid you not), doesn't even apologize that he accused the man of lying when he sees it is actually his birthday, the Dad also pulls out his phone to show the email. The manager says it supposed to be for his next birthday not this one (which makes zero sense) and the Dad points out that's not what the email says. The manager continues to argue with the Dad for quite some time, the other three tables can overhear this entire exchange and from the looks on their faces were just as put off as we were.

39,Jonathon C.,"Madison, WI",57,31,6.0,2.0,2016-08-25,"So, Red Robin has this sorta new Mac n Cheese burger out. I thought today would be a great day to try it. We stopped in at this location because it was very convenient to our location. We were seated immediately. Our waiter was super nice and energetic. I ordered the Mac n cheese burger and the garlic parm fries. The garlic parm fries are one of my favorite things from RR. Our food took a while to get for some reason. There was another table that was seated even after we ordered and they still got their food before we did. When our food came, I was ready to dig in. The garlic parm fries were piping hot and so flavorful. The sandwich on the other hand was way below par. There was so much sauce on the sandwich that you couldn't even taste any other flavors. I ordered this burger because of the Mac and cheese. When I couldn't taste it, it began looking. When I finally found the Mac and cheese, I found 7 small pieces of macaroni with hardly any cheese sauce. The sandwich was just overall so bad that I didn't even eat half of it. I told the server who first off apologized immediately and then went and got the manager. The manager came over and he just tried giving excuse after excuse of why there was not any Mac n cheese on the burger and why they out so much sauce on it. I'm sorry, I try not to complain too much but I felt something needed to be said. I would have left it as it was until the manager began to argue with me. I was done. I am a paying customer and when the sandwich looks nothing like what they advertise, then there is something wrong. The manager didn't even try to offer me something else on the menu, he just walked away from our table. Not a very good manager/leader in my opinion. As good as things appear on the menu/emails, do not expect it to be the actual thing in the restaurant. Not a very good experience.

Guest that were seated after us were greeted promptly and there orders as well. We waited about 15min before they took our order. 20min for our food to come out while guest who were seated after us already had there food an just about done. Not to mention they had our same server. When we finally got our food it wasn't even hot...My bun was super cold like they just pulled out the cooler.  The broccoli they gave me was dried up like prunes. They did replace it with sweet potato fries but those weren't even hot. She never came back to refill our drinks yet her other guest who sat after us was already on there 2nd refill. As a Bartender and server myself downtown. The service was unacceptable an we will not be returning to the one at this location or maybe get another server. I really felt like we were being discriminated by our server cause we were black. The only black ones in her section and were almost completely ignored by her not to mention she wasn't welcoming at all. But the other guest who just so happen to all be white got exceptional service. I'm not one to pull the race card but this was definitely one of those experiences from our server this past Sunday. Everyone else was great and super nice at the host stand. But that server should be fired cause I have never in my life experienced such horrible service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-indianapolis?start=40,2.64,2.64,2.64,2.404,2.64
36,Andrew B.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,8,,4.0,2016-09-21,"Those at home burgers you make and think ""man, if I owned my own place this would be on the menu""...well the Red Robin menu creators did just that. Love the burgers! I prefer the sweet potato fries over the normal but the standard fries are good too. The sauces are incredible and are countless in options.

44,Mandy B.,"Indianapolis, IN",52,72,8.0,1.0,2016-09-28,"Sadly, I need to update on my most recent experience negatively. I decide last night to order carry out because I just didn't want to go back in due to the previous experience. I was going to use the gift card I received due to the bad experience last time sent to me. I called the line and the phone just rang, rang, rang. I called three times and eventually hit a different option in order to get someone to pick up. I am not sure of the hostess' name but she was so rude. I told her the other phone just rang and she rudely replied that they were busy so there's nothing she can do. I asked her to take my order and she huffed and puffed and asked me what I want. As I started ordering she kept interrupting me to ask what else I wanted. I was trying to tell her specifics about my order. Then, she told me it'll be about an hour. I asked for my total and she said she's just a hostess so she don't know. I then said ok I'll wait. She, again, rudely responded well, you will have to call back then because she's busy. I said ma'am I need to know how much money to send with my husband. She didn't tell me to hold on or anything just put me on hold. After about 20 minutes on hold I gave up. I do believe she would have kept me on hold on purpose. I tried calling back an hour later. A nice young lady named Tonya answered and I asked to speak to a manager. She put me on hold and the same mean rude hostess got back on the line and asked me who I was and why I needed a manager. I said I was a customer and had an issue I'd like to speak to a manager about. She would not let me talk to a manager. She just kept saying they were busy. Now, I understand the restaurant business because I was a server for 7 years and then a service manager for 3 years. Even though it may get busy you must never lose that customer service. It's a part of the job, always treat customers with hospitality. Period. If a customer asked for a manager, they should be able to speak to a manager. I just can't fathom the ridiculous service at this location. She is entirely too rude to be in the front of the house.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-indianapolis?start=40,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.6280000000000006,2.48

A friend and I went for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon, we were greeted and served right away, but while walking through the dining room, the first thing I noticed was how dirty everything was. Food and crumbs all over the floor, dirty tables....there was a coke on an empty table that we walked by coming in and going out! Service was ok, our waiter was friendly enough. The only thing that shined at this place was my burger, it was fantastic.

16,Joe W.,"Southport, IN",19,39,1.0,2.0,2016-11-27,"Visited this location around 2:30 in the afternoon. This is important for my review because they weren't very busy being between lunch and dinner. The floors were in horrible condition. Trash and food all over the restaurant. The hostess cleaned off a table but wiping the food crumbs to the floor then sat a customer at that table without sweeping the floor. The customer pointed it out and then they swept but just by that table. The restroom was the same way with paper towels all over the floor. My drink came out in a dirty glass with food stuck to the outside of the glass.  I did give them 2 stars only because the food was pretty good and was warm when it came out. The draw back about the food was that two sandwiches fries and two sodas totaled $33.00 with tax. Too much for sandwiches.  Over priced food, dirty store. Not worth going back. Wrote this review then saw the other reviews. It looks like a recent history of this location being dirty. I'd be afraid of how dirty the kitchen is.

4,Spencer A.,"Indianapolis, IN",69,53,55.0,4.0,2016-12-10,"I've visited this Red Robin twice now and came away satisfied both times. I really like the options from the Red's Tavern Menu and the Cheese Lover's Lineup. They are fairly cheap (as low as $6.99 for a burger and bottomless fries) and offer plenty of food to fill you up. If not, you can always get more fries. As others have mentioned, the service hasn't been the best I've ever had, but you get what you pay for. I like the screens that they have at each table which allow you to pay, tip, sign, and get a receipt without waiting for a server.

They do stay attentive to you.     My serious problem is this new stupid computer they use on every table that has games and other dumb features to try to milk more money out of you. The most insulting part is the idea you can't even get up and go pay your bill, or have your bill picked up with the typical CC. You have to deal with this stupid screen which I can do, but I was so seriously embarrassed for the wonderful middle aged couple that were struggling like hell with the computer, and a server literally had to embarrassingly walk them through each and every step to pay their bill. I stayed and watched as this dragged out for over ten minutes while other people looked on this dilemma of these poor folks!! What the hell!?!  Just take their card and their check and process it!!

We weren't in a hurry which is good because it took over an hour to eat here. Realistically closer to 90min.  The food was reasonably good but only warm, not hot, when it arrived.  Worst part was the server (kasey) . She was really bad.  The slogan is 'gourmet burgers and brews' but she had no idea what beers they carried.   After going to the bar to ask she didn't bother to write down what style the various beers were.  When asked, her reply was ""I don't know anything about beer you can go ask the bartender.""  Up until this point she had been friendly but then became rude for the rest of the visit.  The servers around seemed competent so I guess this is hit or miss.  Attitude was all on her but preparedness and knowing the menu I put on management.    We won't be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-indianapolis?start=20,2.36,2.36,2.36,,2.36

Our waiter quickly introduced himself and took our drink orders, while passing out the menus. We decided on the boneless wings for an appetizer. They came with pickle slices on a bed of potato chips. Wings were okay, chips didn't have much flavor.

He said it was good as well. My mom didn't go the normal route at a burger establishment. She opted for the Clucks and Shrimp(chicken tenders and shrimp) and she said it was okay. I think our burgers were better. All of our meals came with bottomless fries, but with such a filling burger I wasn't able to put that to use. I could only finish half of my burger.
