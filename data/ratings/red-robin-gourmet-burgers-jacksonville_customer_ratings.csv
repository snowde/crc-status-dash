It took a while for me to get my food, even though it wasn't remotely busy inside. I was so hungry that I opened it on my way back to my office to steal a piece of bread that comes with it, only there wasn't any in there. And then when I went to eat the salad, ALL of the ingredients weren't even remotely fresh. The lettuce was on the verge of going bad, the bacon was gross, and the chicken tenders were cold (they usually come out hot and tasty).

It kinda set the tone for Jacksonville. How wrong can you go with burger and fries? Not the Red Robins we remember from Florida before going overseas. We ordered a cheese pizza for our son and they sent out a pepperoni pizza after 25 minutes. He was the last one to get his food. We told the waitress we didn't eat pork and needed a different one. She was really nice and apologized for the mistake. My husband watched as she took it back and explained to the cook the mistake. The cook then removed the pepperoni with his hands and put it back on the counter so it could be sent to our table within a minute... All while my husband was looking at this. Words cannot express the disgust we all felt.  None of us ate our food. I cannot imagine what goes on where customers can't see. After complaints and apologies.. We received no discount!!!

Kera was our waitress for about 17 people or so and she did great, drinks were full, and she continued to check on us to make sure everything was well with us without being annoying. The manager even came over to congratulate me and my husband and offered to take care of anything we needed, hostess were even amazing seating us and showing us our party.

42,Nicole M.,"Jacksonville, NC",19,28,9.0,4.0,2016-03-30,"So I normally get burgers here. Every time my husband and I go there its always super good. I decided to use the to go service and try something new which was the Chili Chili con queso. I would not recommend getting this. Its a little different than any queso I've tried. Its almost like they were trying a new spin on it. And I'm not a fan. The Tortilla chips too will throw you off, they are cut into strips and are more like multi-grain. The thing that just amazed me though was the little bit they give you for the 7.00 you pay for the queso. I have no problem paying 7.00 for queso but it should at least be great. And to me it wasn't. Defiantly hit Red Robin up for their burgers and onion rings but skip the queso!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jacksonville?start=40,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64

The hostess at front playing on their phones not even acknowledging my family walking in the door, and then the grease slime all over the table and dirty silverware to start off without even ordering food. The food was either sitting for a long time or reheated because everything from the bun to vegetables were soggy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jacksonville,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8
10,Mickey A.,"Wilmington, NC",124,83,86.0,3.0,2017-06-04,"I love Red Robin, but today wasn't my best experience. We waited at least ten minutes after being sat down before being greeted by our server. Once she started helping us, she was very energetic and knowledgeable about the menu. However, once our food came out, I was highly disappointed. Whether the fries are ""bottomless"" or not, the initial portion was a joke. We both looked up from our plates and laughed about how few we received. The burgers were both very good, but once we had finished our fries I was starting to get upset about the service again. Our server seemed like she may have had too many tables, and too far apart from each other. She was literally running around so much that she asked us how we were doing mid-walk, without even stopping at the table. So even though we wanted more fries we didn't get the chance to say anything, as she was already around the corner before we could realize she had said anything to us. Eventually, she asked us if we wanted refills on drinks and fries while standing at the table next to us, and a few minutes later returned to say the manager would bring them to us because the kitchen was being slow. So when the manager came out, he only brought the regular fries for my boyfriend, and not my garlic Parmesan ones which I only still asked for because it cost $1.50 extra. Those came about five minutes later, by the time we were already ready to go. Like I said, not my best Red Robin visit but I'll return at another location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jacksonville,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84

First she didn't bring us our drinks when we requested our drinks she forgets to bring straws, then she doesn't provide any napkins, then I politely ask for ketchup because there was none at our table. She comes back and ""throws"" the napkins at our table and walks off. My order was wrong a much cheaper burger than the one advertised online it was the taco burger instead of the double tavern one. I let her know. The whole time I refrained myself from saying anything to her because she was handling our food. My entire life as a consumer I have never had as horrible service as I did at this establishment. I used to be a regular for me and my family at Red Robin, NEVER AGAIN! You guys have lost my business forever. I'll be going to Ruby Tuesday's from now on. This is ridiculous, I have never been disrespected like this by anyone before. If she didn't want to serve me she should have just switched out with another waitress. Luckily I had my wife next to me to keep me from making a scene. But I guess that's what you get in city. I wish there was 0 stars, please be weary of this place they are not there for active duty and vets all they care about is your money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jacksonville,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004

They were out of broccoli which they did not tell me til after I ordered and then had nothing to replace it with . So they gave me more salad. This time in a small bowl which then forgot to put any dressing with it. The Cole slaw was the best part of the meal !

Our waitress came over a few minutes later and took our order. I religiously get the bacon and Bleu Burger. It is french fried onions on the bottom, bacon and blue cheese on top of the Patty. The onion bun is exceptional! They never skimp on the blue cheese which makes me rather happy! My friend surprised me with a Not Your Father's Root Beer Float and it was delicious! Being a part of the rewards program for Red Robin is beneficial! They email you wonderful specials frequently and you earn a free birthday burger as well!  Lastly, the friend that came with me is gluten-free and they have bun options for her. From what I have heard many places have buns that are subpar when compared to a regular bun. Red Robin uses a bun that, as she says, is still tasty. Win!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-jacksonville,3.2,3.2,3.2,,3.2000000000000006
