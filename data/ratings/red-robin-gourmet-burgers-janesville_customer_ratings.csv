20,Tiffany S.,"Roscoe, IL",17,19,,4.0,2012-03-06,"We had the chance to dine here recently. I really appreciate a restaurant that doesn't balk when you tell them that you and your husband are going to be splitting a burger... Not only that, they split it for us and brought us each our own half with fries. Bottomless sweet potato fries. Our waitress was fantastic and the service was fast and accurate. Gotta love Red Robin!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-janesville?start=20,,,,,
17,Jeff P.,"Beverly Hills, CA",0,28,8.0,1.0,2012-07-15,"For what you get... the price is absurd.  Am a paying for the ""atmosphere"", which consists of loud annoying patrons... and children. These chain restaurants need to go. This place is an abomination... and it suits Janesville well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-janesville,,,,,
18,Christopher B.,"Elkhorn, WI",38,61,31.0,4.0,2012-07-18,"I typically don't review restaurant chains because there usually isn't much to write about but red robin is an exception. This place has one of my favorite burgers on the planet called the ""A-1 peppercorn burger"". Onion bun, applewood smoked bacon, pepperjack cheese and an A-1 peppercorn sauce that hits it outta the park.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-janesville,,,,,
13,Crystal N.,"Fredericksburg, VA",19,2,3.0,1.0,2013-06-27,"Maybe I'm too picky, but somehow I got it in my head that when I pay 5x more for food than if I had made it at home, I should at least have a good experience. I have been here 4 times and every time they get both mine and my fiancés order wrong, for me it's not such a big deal, but he has severe dairy allergies and could go into shock if he eats even a small amount. So of course I tell them they need to be careful, and every time we have been there they send his burger out with cheese and when we send it back we have to wait another thirty minutes for a replacement. Though this is annoying it was fine since we have always caught it.  This last time they sent his burger out with cheese, even though we told the waitress three times that he can't have cheese, whatever.. We sent it back and they brought a new one. I saw something on the bun that looked like butter and asked her what it was... She said it was mayo. Ok no big deal, he can have mayo. So we ate and are about to leave when I look up and his face is just freaking COVERED in hives. So I yell for my waitress because i don't want to just leave and not pay, while he goes to the car to use his emergency allergy stick. 3 minutes later she finally arrives, I frantically tell her what has happened and give her my debit card and tell her to swipe it quick because I need to get my guy to the freaking hospital. Instead of doing as she's told and just swiping card she spends 5 minutes looking for the manager. Never again... *slogan music* Red Robyn.......death",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-janesville,,,,,
16,James C.,"Janesville, WI",25,52,3.0,3.0,2013-06-29,I have never had an issue at this restaurant but it is a typical chain sit down restaurant. The reason I go is that is quick service and has food that my kids will eat. The burger I like best is the Royal but lately I have been getting a salad. If you are needing a fast but sit down restaurant this place will meet that need.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-janesville,,,,,
14,Timothy S.,"Madison, WI",15,446,,3.0,2013-10-17,"Stopped by here the other night.   We had good service.  Having recently had a less than perfect meal at a RR in Madison we were cautious.   I won't order their seafood.   It is disappointing.   But the Southwest Salad is a favorite of mine and I had a terrible one that was very small not too long ago.   To my pleasure this one was done as others had been in the past.  large size, good portions of chicken and the deep fried jalepenos done perftectly.   Another person in our party had the Primehouse Burger which was done perfectly. Thanks for a good meal RR. The 8 dollar magaritta was weak.  I wouldn't order it again.  It did have good flavor but I want my tequila. Stopped back Dec 2017 and the bathroom was out of towels and toilet paper.   Had to tell the staff but their solution for the lack of towels was to set a roll on the sink.  What?  No time to put it in the dispenser?  Lost the key?  Floor could use a mopping. I ordered the southwest chicken salad and from past experience of them leaving off the fried jalapeño coins I looked for them and sure enough, no jalapeños!  What?  Is this standard procedure to leave these off and hope people don't notice?  This is now the third time this has happened at a RR restaurant.   They made the coins but I had to wait.  Their apology was a cup of fries which I didn't really need because I had already ordered fries on the side.   My meal of chicken fingers was ok but not something I would order again.  This time was not my the best experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-janesville,,,,,
15,Ronald G.,"Milton, WI",1,19,7.0,4.0,2013-11-02,"We love RR. My son cannot have gluten and gets his burger in a gluten free bun. My other son loves the kid's mac and cheese and always gets a refill. I love the banzai burger and fish and chips while my wife loves the wraps and salads. Friendly service and unlimited fries, too! I think the prices are pretty reasonable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-janesville,,,,,
11,Tim W.,"Madison, WI",0,6,3.0,3.0,2014-09-20,"Has been good in the past. Food is still good but a bit of an issue with the gluten free menu. It is now only available online, which means you need a smart phone or a tablet. While most people have smartphones, the website you need to access isn't in mobile format which makes it difficult to use. They will provide you with an iPad upon request, but the process is a bit cumbersome.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-janesville,,,,,
12,Loretta Z.,"Oxnard, CA",2,19,,5.0,2014-12-28,"This is my second time here and I am once again totally impressed. Good food and fantastic service.This place had a great atmosphere, our server was Holly and she was awesome. Really just the perfect server!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-janesville,,,,,
10,Michael H.,"Janesville, WI",2,2,,5.0,2015-02-19,"I loved the Smoke and Pepper Burger, it is expensive but so worth it. The wait staff was fast and friendly. I came just before the super rush.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-janesville,,,,,
9,Seth H.,"Janesville, WI",1,32,3.0,1.0,2015-02-27,Had the worst experience at this restaurant.  I ordered the French onion soup. It came out and it was cold. Then the soup spoon had what appeared to be blood on it. I told the waiter and it took him quite a long time to get a new spoon and another bowl of soup.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-janesville,,,,,
8,Richard S.,"Janesville, WI",0,7,,4.0,2015-07-12,"I am a fan of a good burger and Red Robin does serve a good one. I think as far as value goes Red Robin is a little on the pricey side for their burgers. They offer a burgers that generally range from $9-$16 which includes a side. Their fries are bottomless, so eat away. I like the onion rings appetizer (which is about dozen) but again a little pricey at $9.99. They have good salads, a few lower calorie menu offerings and few healthy sandwiches, like a veggie burger and a turkey burger. The freckled strawberry lemonade are awesome and you get refills! If you are going to visit them somewhat regularly I suggest signing up for the Red Robin rewards card. You can earn free burgers on you month of your birthday and a free one after ten visits. They sometimes email you other specials, like we got a free desert. This Janesville location generally has pretty good service, during peak times. The staff has pretty good teamwork during peak periods, like dinner. You will be full when you leave that's for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-janesville,,,,,
5,Todd Q.,"Janesville, WI",25,30,13.0,4.0,2015-10-29,"Have been here many times. Very good food overall. My server last night was pretty bad at keeping our drinks from going empty. Sat for 20 min with empty beer glass. Had to motion her over to refill. Other than a young server, food was outstanding and hot. I recommend this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-janesville,,,,,
4,Nickie C.,"London, United Kingdom",133,446,373.0,3.0,2015-11-11,"Really enjoyed my bacon tavern burger! I've had the fancier burgers in the past from the finest and gourmet section but wasn't that impressed. This one though was delicious. I'm not a big fan of the steak fries, even with them being bottomless. I never have more than a couple. On this visit, we had a problem with our waitress - she didn't put our order in for ages and after 30 minutes of waiting, people who came in well after us had their food and we were still waiting. A complaint to the manager put things right - our food was rushed out, we were checked on numerous times, and our meal was comped. Mistakes happen, of course, but it really helps when an effort is made to sort out the problem, and compensation given for the hassle. I'll be back, and hopefully next time I can do that 4th star!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-janesville,,,,,
7,Jordan K.,"Janesville, WI",0,30,,4.0,2015-11-17,"Though the menu is simple American style foods, there is plenty of flavor and diversity to be found. The burgers and appetizers are always solid! Never get tired of the bottomless fries either. If you are looking for an excellent casual restaurant than you can't go wrong here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-janesville,,,,,

1,Carrie H.,"Janesville, WI",0,8,4.0,5.0,2017-01-05,"Now that the holidays are over I'm writing my review. We were there 12/22/2016.  The service was great! There was a very short wait to be seated due to the large amounts of people there. We had come during a shift change for someone and were taken to an area that was totally full by mistake.  We were seated in the bar area in a very quaint comfortable booth. We weren't bunched in to the booth. Plenty of room.  Our waiter was great, not dropping at the table every three seconds to be annoying, but not disappearing for twenty minutes at a time either. It was just right. The food was great and the drinks were excellent! Red Robin is a part of our Christmas Holliday 2016 memories!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-janesville,,,,,

0,Stacy H.,"Janesville, WI",3,16,37.0,5.0,2017-09-15,"The food at this location is always great! We ask for a basket of fries as an appetizer since they're bottomless with your meal. My burger was cooked perfectly, fries were hot, and my glass was never empty. My sister has a gluten sensitivity and they're great about accommodating this. They have gluten free buns, a menu of burgers with gf ingredients, and will make a special batch of fries for those with allergies. Very happy with our visit!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-janesville,,,,,
