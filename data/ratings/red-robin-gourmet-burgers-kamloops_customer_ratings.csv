12,Bob E.,"Kamloops, Canada",0,2,,4.0,2012-09-21,"Great hamburger restaurant, but application has placed it in an incorrect position on the map.  Actual location is up on west Columbia, which is up in Sahali area in same shopping centre as Homesense and Jysk.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kamloops,,,,,
5,Laura W.,"Kamloops, Canada",13,57,3.0,4.0,2014-03-14,"We came here for a family lunch on a Saturday. It was very busy but we were greeted and seated promptly by a very friendly hostess. Our waitress was there to take drink orders in no time. The kids got coloring pages and crayons to occupy them, great job! We all ordered burgers, the kids had cheeseburgers, I had a blue cheese burger and hubby had the chop burger (prime rib??).  I like that the kids can choose their side dish and not be only limited to fries, although that is what they chose anyway haha. Food was quickly delivered, and our drinks were refilled before we were empty and never needed to ask!  The steak fries were a nice change from regular fries, nicely seasoned too.  My burger was absolutely scrumptious, just the perfect amount of blue cheese and the fried onions on it made it that much better.  The kids devoured their meals, as did my husband. While we were there, the Red Robin mascot was also there and visited each table. The kids got hugs, balloons, and a coupon for their meal. The were ecstatic! I didn't have huge expectations when coming here but I was totally blown away by the awesome service and food. We will definitely be come back again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kamloops,,,,,
9,Brody P.,"Kamloops, Canada",1,22,,2.0,2014-08-14,"The fries are terrible. Floury and unmistakeably frozen, the frozem ones my mother cooked in the oven when I was a kid tasted better. The variety of burger options was pretty good, but billing themselves as a gourmet burger joint is laughable..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kamloops,,,,,
8,Mathew B.,"Kamloops, Canada",0,7,,4.0,2015-01-20,Love the burgers here. I have not found one I didn't like yet. Favorite is the banzai burger....... so good. Great place for the family and kids. My daughter has a wrap everyone and loves it. The service is always friendly and fast. I'll keep going back. Only thing I don't like is it's really quite loud but in a place like this it's to be expected,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kamloops,,,,,
6,Peter P.,"Kamloops, Canada",2,4,,4.0,2015-04-05,Was really good food and great staff! Friendly right from the time you walk in the door till the time you leave. All in all it was good place to eat. Food was really tasty. Only thing is its a little pricey for the portion that you get.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kamloops,,,,,
7,Jim T.,"Kamloops, Canada",1,76,1.0,1.0,2015-06-15,I had to put my chicken burger down after their Red Robin mascot came by my table and stared at me until I put it down.  I've never lost my appetite like that before.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kamloops,,,,,
3,Alouise D.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",150,530,113.0,3.0,2015-09-07,"My friend and I were en route from Edmonton to Vancouver and stopped in Kamloops for dinner at this Red Robin. I like Red Robin. There menu is standard American/Canadian burger fare. The prices are decent. The service here was really good, and the restaurant was clean (although my friend's spoon that she got for her soup was dirty - the waitress apologized and got her a clean spoon right away).  I got the Royal Red Robin Burger. It's a beef burger with lettuce, tomoto, cheese, bacon and a fried egg. It tasted delicious, and maybe it was the richness of the burger but after we left I wasn't feeling so great. Definitely not something you want when you still have to drive another 5 hours to Vancouver. I like Red Robins, but I've learned my lesson. It's definitely not road trip food.  If I'm in Kamloops, spending some time there, I might check out Red Robins again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kamloops,,,,,
11,Helen S.,"Kamloops, Canada",0,3,,1.0,2015-10-22,"My family and I were out of town all day long and when we came back with no cooked food at home, we decided to try our local Red Robin's. Our food came quick...maybe even a bit too quick! We wondered about the fast timing, but ate it anyway because we were all starving! My husband ordered the BBQ whiskey beef burger with fries, and I ordered the BBQ whiskey chicken wrap with yam fries. I already started feeling somewhat nauseous while eating, and on the car ride home I felt very nauseous. A few minutes after arriving at home I got so sick that I had to run to the bathroom to throw up. Not too much time passed when my stomach started feeling very upset and (sorry if it's a bit too much info) for the rest of the night had an extreme case of diarrhea. Later that night it was my husbands turn. We had planned a beautiful lunch with the family what had later turned out to be a horrible rest of the day with food poisoning! Next day I contacted Red Robin's and spoke with their male manager. He was not too happy to hear me say that we had food poisoning although not confirmed by a doctor. He was friendly but not helpful what so ever! He took some information and did contact me back, only to suggest we go see a doctor. There was no way we could have gone to a walk in on a holiday weekend (thanksgiving), because most where closed earlier than usual, and we definitely didn't want to sit at the hospital for hours just to confirm that it was in fact food poisoning. (just to add...I've had food poisoning before, so I know how my body reacts to it). Instead I decided to go to Nature's fare and purchase Active Charcoal, which will only be effective if you do have food poisoning....it won't be effective for anything else like a stomach flu for example. We tried that, and after only taking one of them, the symptoms subsided....that was my own kind of confirmation right there. I contacted Red Robin's immediately, and told them everything. Unfortunately the manager I had talked to before was not in that day, so they promised me a phone call back at the end of the week. Well guess what, that phone call never came! I wouldn't be so fast in writing such a negative review about this place if they would have apologized and done the right thing (like a refund or something) but this was not acceptable! We had to suffer with food poisoning for several days, and they don't even have the guts to come out and admit that it might have been something they did, and just try to fix it to make sure we'd be returning customers...but in this case, I will not go back there, and I will definitely not recommend this to anyone, and will tell others about our experience there!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kamloops,,,,,
1,Elsa C.,"Burnaby, Canada",31,219,800.0,4.0,2016-06-19,"Continuing my birthday gifts, I decided to redeem my complementary burger from their loyalty program.  Ambiance: The place was quite busy with diners on a Friday that is close to 9pm. It has the typical Red Robin layout, but much cleaner and newer than the ones we have been in Vancouver. Choices of seating: bar seating area with a few small TVs, table style seating, or booth style seating. We were given the booth style seating.  Service: We were promptly greeted and seated by our waiter as we walked in. The waiter was nice and friendly. Our server came by quite quickly and took our drink orders. When she came back I informed her that I was there to claim my birthday burger. She took my phone number and informed me the birthday burger will be credited. She was good at checking in with us from time to time about our order during our meal. I am restricting myself from having too much condiments so I requested the condiments to be given on the side. The server was accommodating and offered suggestions as well, which I appreciate. Kitchen: After deliberating through the thick menu, we decided to order the Bleu Ribbon (with garden salad and condiments on the side) and the Whiskey River (with fries). We placed our orders at 8:43pm and the orders arrived at 8:53pm. Taste: It tastes pretty good for a burger, but nothing really special. The patty was charred pretty nicely and was juicy. The fries were thickly cut, but really lack potatoes in the inside. The condiments are tasty, but again - nothing special. Portions: I love the fact that I can order bottomless garden salad with no extra cost. The hubs appreciate the bottomless fries, but the original order was enough. The burgers are definitely big. I just wish the protein portion has a larger ratio than the rest of the burger. Value: I was comped with ~$13 for the Bleu Ribbon burger and the hub's Whiskey River burger came up to be ~$13 as well. I don't think the burgers were worth $13. Overall: Food-wise the place was like any chain restaurant. Service and cleanliness was better than others and hence the +1 on the review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kamloops,,,,,
4,Clint V.,"Surrey, Canada",0,6,,1.0,2016-07-21,Wow. This place has the worst service our waittress got our order wrong seemed like she was still learning the menu. On top of that she gave our food to the wrong table. Never again. Good thing we were just passing thru kamloops and this is not our resident red robin. I must say though the food was on point. Boys in the kitchen know what there doing I,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kamloops,,,,,
2,Janet H.,"Sandusky, OH",48,83,426.0,4.0,2016-11-11,"OMG the A1 burger tastes really good. I had it with open faced and side salad with Italian source. The patty was juicy and moisture in side.  The finest chicken burger was waffle bun, a little sweet and chili with fried chicken inside.  The other girl ordered a diet salad with grilled chicken breast . I a really satisfied with the real beef burger taste. A lot of ppl on remeberence day tho",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kamloops,,,,,
0,Barry W.,"Montreal, Canada",0,19,,4.0,2017-10-24,"I'd prefer not to say how many times I've been here in the past few months, but I can say this: What keeps me coming back is just their basic $8.50 burger. Filling, juicy, well-crafted, and served with bottomless fries or salad, it's an amazing deal for a fine meal. Stay away from (as far as I've tried) literally everything else on the menu. Chicken Caesar salad? Just don't go there. Monster double-patty burger? Sure, if you after a messy pig-out. Stick to the burgers (especially the basic ones), and you'll walk away with a full stomach and a happy wallet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kamloops,,,,,
