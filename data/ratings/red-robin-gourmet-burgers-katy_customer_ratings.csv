I had the smoke and pepper burger.  The burger was big and juicy.  The bun was not dry.  Delicious...this was a good burger.  It also packs in over 1000 calories, so be prepared.  Note that RR has a list of other items you can substitute for the fries, some with an up-charge, some not.  I had the black beans and they were a good complement to the meal. Our service was good.  Nick answered our questions and kept us happy. There were three people in our party...two burgers, an order of fish tacos, an iced tea and two waters.  $45 seems a little high for what we received.  This place is a great restaurant except for the prices. As noted in other reviews, RR has offered discounts when showing your Cinemark movie tickets, but call ahead to verify. I have been to the bar area at RR in the past, and it is a great place to meet after coming back to the Cinemark park-and-ride after work.  The bartenders are friendly and  drink prices are reasonable.  Appetizer specials are also available. Anyway, for taste, service and cost, I still have not seen a burger joint in the Katy area that compares to Fuddruckers at Katy Mills or Whataburger near Westheimer Parkway/Grand Parkway.

They do it without being asked. Reason I why I gave 4 stars rather than 5 is because I ordered a burger that was supposed to be bacon lovers, I forgot the name, I think pig out burger. I only got 2 slices of bacon and barely any bacon aioli sauce. Cmon now! That's ridiculous, I expect the burger overflowing with bacon. But it was a good burger. Just not how I expected it!

The speckled lemonade was also good.  When we arrived we were led to a table with food and dirty napkins under it, I had to ask for it to be swept up as I'm in a orthotic boot and really didn't want someone's dirty napkin on it. The service was slow, we sat with empty drinks for quite sometime, as well as waited to pay our check. The worst part of our meal was my daughters grilled chicken sticks off the kids menu came out cold, literally cold. The plate was warm, but dirty, it had some white cheese like something stuck to the top of the corner of the plate. It was quite dirty, though dirty dishes are never what you want anywhere. I sent the chicken back and happen to notice it was placed under the heat lamps. When I saw our waitress I asked if they were making new ones or just reheating the old ones. She walked back to the kitchen and then threw them away. If I had not said anything I'm wondering if she would have been served reheated food. The manager brought her the new chicken as well as as the drink we had asked to be refilled 10 minutes earlier. He did not even offer an apology for the food being served cold and on a dirty plate. A simple apology goes a long way in making things better.

I am 9 months pregnant, was super hungry, had never been to Red Robin and it was right there. So I said why not? We were promptly seated by a nice, attentive hostess who answered my husband's questions about the best/most popular menu items.  Our server, Perry, arrived a few minutes later to take our drink orders and we all asked for lemonades. After the drinks arrived, we decided to order the boneless wings appetizer with buffalo sauce and barbecue sauce on the side.  Perry came back about 15 minutes later to take our entree orders, but didn't mention our appetizer, i.e. ""It'll be out soon."" As he walked away, I told my husband ""I hope he didn't forget our appetizer."" Another 10-15 minutes went by before Perry arrived with the wings. Well, I can't say they were worth the wait. There was too much breading so they were a bit hard, and there was an aftertaste as though they had been fried in old oil. The barbecue sauce was just OK, but I really liked the buffalo sauce. Also, the fried potato chips that came with the wings were extremely salty. I was only able to eat one.  Now, here comes the worst part of our dining experience. As I was sipping my strawberry lemonade through a straw, I noticed a strange, pinkish smear on the rim of my glass. For reference, my lips had never touched the glass as I only drink with straws at restaurants. I decided to wipe at the smear with a napkin and it was lipstick! Obviously, it was someone else's, as I had only drank through the straw and I wasn't even wearing any lipstick. I was thoroughly disgusted that I had been served a drink in a dirty glass that clearly hadn't been washed since the previous customer used it. I was shocked. I set the drink aside and waited for Perry. My husband motioned him over a few minutes later, and I told him my glass had lipstick on it as I showed him the smear. All he said was ""I'll get you another one"" as he grabbed the drink and walked away. At the very least, I expected an apology and an offer to deduct the cost of the drink from our bill. However, I decided to let the situation go as I had already decided I was never coming back. I just wanted to eat my burger and go home.  My husband and I both had the Southern Charm Burger. It was quite good, but a bit small in my opinion considering it cost $14+. Our bill(including the tip) was about $65. I thought our dining experience was overpriced considering the underwhelming appetizer, lipstick-smeared glass, service and the small portions.

Out entrees were the BLTA and the Marco Polo. The BLTA was good and had plenty of meat and the bread was fresh. I had never had the Marco Polo and it's a chicken sandwich with aioli, arugula, and bacon and it was delicious. Juicy chicken and flavorful bacon made it all I could have asked for.  The best part is that they set up table top entertainment now that also allows you to order refills, appetizers, and desserts on your own right from your seat.

However, my husband was in the mood for a great burger and suggested we have lunch there today, so off we went! And I'm so happy we did! My husband ordered their classic Bacon Cheeseburger with steak fries and I ordered their new Avocado Chicken Wedgie with a side salad. It's a grilled chicken breast wrapped in iceburg lettuce that is stuffed with avocado, bacon, and tomato. Mmmmmmm. Everything was fresh and amazingly delicious.

I was craving junk, I wanted a burger made from real beef, Red Robin has always been a crowd pleaser coupled with endless steak fries, why not right?!  While my burger was hot and fresh, it the meat it self was almost tasteless, the sesame seed bun took over my bacon cheeseburger with provolone cheese, and the fixings on the side.  I was expecting a juicy cut of meat. I also ordered boneless hot wings, good enough, steak fries were hot, could of used a tad bit more crisp to them, but hey they weren't cold and soggy. The bartender was nice enough, not full of conversation which was fine, but a little pep in her step couldn't have hurt the show.

When my burger arrived, which was wrong from the jump, (asked for the veggies on the side-it didn't arrive that way) it was cold! My husband was ""warm"" but just barely.  Then, after removing the bun and veggies there was 2 TINY ""pieces"" of avocado, no complete slices, as if they were left over from someone else's plate. The hamburger patty was all split in half and they'd used to cheese as glue to hold it all together.  My husbands party was even worse.

13,Y C.,"Katy, TX",0,30,2.0,3.0,2017-07-19,"This has been a pretty regular place for my family ever since it was built. Their burgers and other items on the menu are good and the service has always been great. The only negative I have is in recent years we have noticed their burger and epecially the fish on their fish and chips get much smaller and smaller without a change in price to reflect that change. As a matter of fact the prices are a bit higher. Just enough that it's easy to miss it if you don't go often enough to know their prices. This is unfortunate because the fish and chips is actually one of our family favorites when we're not in the mood for burgers. When they first opened you got 4 large pieces of fish that were so big that they laid over the bed of fries and covered them. They were so big and delicious. I often couldn't finish them but were a good size for my husband, who eats much bigger portions than I do. Then a couple years ago the fish were cut more narrow but similar in length as in the past. Then they got shorter and shorter over time. Tonight, the fish were cut the smallest I had ever seen them. You can tell they took 2 of what used to be their fish and cut them in half to serve the 4 pieces. I was so disappointed that I mentioned it to our server, who I know has been there for a while because he has served us a number of times. He shrugged his shoulder and said he didn't know they had changed. Oh come on. He's been there long enough to know.... Anyway we won't be considering Red Robin as the top of our list of places to eat out at any more. It will remain a possible choice only if we are in the mood for anything else specifically on their menu.

It had been a long time since I had been to Red Robin, but when it came to mind tonight I was excited about a nice big burger and those tasty bottomless fries.  I was seated and waited on promptly and given a menu. Since I had been there they've really expanded the menu with seemingly great options, but I was so disappointed.  I got there basic burger with cheese and my husband got the Burnin' Love which have been our go to burgers anytime we've ever dined there. We've always enjoyed those specific burgers and if it ain't broke, don't fix it right? I decided to try the garlic parmesan fries and my husband did the regular to complement our burgers.  My burger had bland meat lacking in a great grilled flavor and it was so soggy I had to eat it with a fork. My fries were an absolute joke (I paid an extra $1.49 for them),they came out soaked in oil that was creating a puddle on my plate and heavy chunks of garlic all over them. My husbands burger had watery salsa making it not very desirable and definitely not what he remembered from before. His regular steak fries were good as they've always been, so a couple of points there.  Our tab ended up being $38 for our two burgers, fries, tea and a limeade. Not a bad price had it been some really great burger and fries, but a terrible price for feeling like you got a Chili's quality meal.

We got there around 6PM on a Thursday night, walked up to the hostess desk and requested a table for 2. There were several empty tables in sight, so we were confused at the fact that they told us it would be a 15 minute wait. Bewildered, but excited for the dining experience that we had in store, we asked if we could sit at the bar while we waited. The hostess giggled and said ""I don't know."" We look at the bar, it's empty. With a confused look, I asked if the bar was open seating, as many if not all bars are in this great country are. She continued to laugh and confirmed that she did not know the answer to what I believe is a very simple question. Confused, we wistfully made our way to the waiting room. During this time we looked on as they sat at least two parties of three, that did not have reservations. Neglected, hungry, and vulnerable we watched on as the host and hostesses strategically negotiated which of the two dozen empty tables they would sit this troublesome party of two. It was like watching two fierce competitors strategically moving their pawns to conquer Magnolia in the board game War. In awe of this overly complicated process, I watched as the hostess drew up what must have been the most complex hypothetical scenario, and concluded that they had found the one and only table for us. We sat down at our destined table only to notice the crunch of glass under our feet. The salt shaker had fallen, and nobody had cleaned it up. Annoyed, I threw some salt over my shoulder for good luck and alerted the waiter.  Finally, it was the moment we've all been waiting for.... the bottomless fries. Well, ""bottomless"" is somewhat of a deceiving term, as they come in nearly empty baskets with about 7 fries in each basket. Yes, you can request as many as you want, but in order to receive a ""normal"" portion of fries you have to request like 7 refills. This makes you leave feeling like an Angus Heifer heading to slaughter. The campfire sauce was delightful, and after an amount of refills that is not socially acceptable, we received our main course. My fish and chips were great, but I wish I would have taken them up on the pint recommendation, ole' sport. My wife received the entirely wrong burger, but we didn't want to complain as our frustration was most likely visible. I'm not sure if my wife and I will ever be back, as we coined their new advertising phrase... ""Red Robin.... DONE"" (instead of yum).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-katy,3.0,3.19,3.19,,3.114
