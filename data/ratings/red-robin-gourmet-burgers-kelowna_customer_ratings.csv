10,Kayden J.,"Central Okanagan, Canada",2,14,1.0,5.0,2012-02-19,"I have eaten here many times and I have always had a good meal.  The staff is all very friendly and I have never had to wait very long for my meal.  I really look forward to eating here more often as I have a whole menu of delicious items that look like they need me to eat!!  I do have to say I'm not a big fan of the poutine here though pretty over spiced and I have never been able to finish it, that being said It would never stop me from going back and devouring a delicious burger!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kelowna,,,,,
4,Dennis M.,"Sherwood Park, Canada",67,142,66.0,5.0,2014-07-16,Had a fantastic experience here today. Our server Kara was awesome. She was very accommodating to my kids and did a great job in getting our food to us in a good amount of time.  I'm a sucker for the little things. What blew my mind was we ordered one kids meal to split between my boys and asked for a side plate. What they did was split the order into two plates for us. Love it!  Thanks to Kara and the rest of the staff for a great meal in a well air conditioned establishment.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kelowna,,,,,
9,Khanh D.,"Edmonton, Canada",2,2,1.0,4.0,2014-11-08,"You can usually go to a red robin and be satisfied with the food quality, the bottomless fries are always a treat and a great way to get your fill. This review is more for our server Kayla, she was fantastic even with how busy the restaurant got during the meal she ways always coming by to check on our table. The food service was prompt and Kayla also pointed out the daily drink specials that I wasn't even aware of. My hat goes off to her, we definitely could use more servers in this industry as good as Kayla.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kelowna,,,,,

2,Wes Q.,"Kelowna, Canada",2,21,21.0,1.0,2015-07-19,One star is to much. Meal was not complete. Ingredients missing and problem not resolved even after asking to fix the problem. Slow slow slow!!! Not sure why I ever return other than its ok for kids. There are better places to go.  ... Like A & W,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kelowna,,,,,
3,Jamie H.,"Edmonton, Canada",2,31,,4.0,2015-08-06,"A bit of a bumpy start, but all made good. Great place to eat with a family in Kelowna. Kids loved the free balloons.  Food was great. Would recommend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kelowna,,,,,
7,Ryan A.,"Calgary, Canada",4,4,,4.0,2015-08-22,Beautiful lunch on the patio.  Our server Ryan was great.  The Royal red Robin burger was delicious!  Bring Red Robin back to Calgary!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kelowna,,,,,
6,Ry D.,"Kelowna, Canada",2,18,1.0,4.0,2015-11-03,"This place has kind of become my dirty pleasure in the last few years.  It is just so consistent and reliable.  The food's decent and there are actually a lot of customization options to mix it up every now and then.  Service is usually great - some of the best service I've ever had has been at Red Robin.  Only had one bad egg, and the front staff gave us a discount after we expressed our disappointment.  The interior is awful and it's usually very loud but the booths are comfy and clean.  When we can't decide on a place to go, this is usually our backup plan!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kelowna,,,,,
5,Andrew K.,"Kelowna, Canada",0,3,,2.0,2016-07-26,Food looked good. Service was not that good. I Paid $9.19 for 1 small glass of beer!!!  Wow!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kelowna,,,,,
1,Alex K.,"Whitehorse, Canada",12,31,2.0,1.0,2017-11-04,"First and last time at red robin  Low quality food at high prices and terrible service  Reminded me of a rebranded 'Denny""s"" Basically food you buy in the frozen section at Costco and throw in a deep fryer. Wish I had something good to say but it was a terrible experience and I'll never be back. Had the halibut burger -soggy and under cooked  Asked the waitress if the salsa was fresh or cooked  She said ""fresh"" It comes to the table and it was cooked salsa  Would never had ordered it The guacamole was not home made either  1 Star our of 5",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kelowna,,,,,
0,Robert B.,"Surrey, Canada",24,275,529.0,5.0,2018-01-03,"All in all one of the best burger joints around. I personally like their take on the burger fare. The place is open, airy and clean, not to mention bright and cheerful. Good came quick and my black and blue burger was perfect. Loved the sauce and portobellos. Sure it's a bit more expensive than say 5guys or some other place, but the atmosphere and pleasure of being served by quality people is worth it. I'll be back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kelowna,,,,,
