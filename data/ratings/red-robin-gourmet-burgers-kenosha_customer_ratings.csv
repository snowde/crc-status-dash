I used to like this place... my boyfriend and I used to go here at least 2 or 3 times a month, we were there last week and our waitress was horrible, we must have waited 10 minutes after clearly finishing our meal before we got our check and another 10 minutes and a trip to the bar before we could finally pay our bill... which was in the low $20 range... with 4 $20 bills, our awful waitress mistakenly thought she was getting an $18 dollar tip and almost didn't offer us any change, really????? then tonight, we ordered quickly and waited almost 30 mins for 2 burgers, 2 fries.... the manager finally noticed and gave us a gift card on our way out the door, but after 2 cold half-raw burgers and 2 trips in a row with awful awful service, we'll be on the hunt for a new burger joint in Kenosha...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kenosha?start=20,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003,1.8920000000000003

Even if something comes out wrong they always handle it well. My only peeve is that I've watched the bartender make the drinks too strong occasionally.

The waitress never checked back with us until we were almost finished eating.

I really like that I can get lettuce wraps instead of the bun in case I don't feel like carb loading. Today I had the smoke and pepper burger. Really yummy with much more spice than a regular burger. Best part was the big slice of aged cheddar on top. Not the usual wimpy cheese slice here. More money than a regular better but more tasty. Staff was friendly and anxious to find us a clean table.

She was very good with her customer service. We didn't wait long for our onion rings to come as well as our entrée. The food looked presentable.  My girlfriend got the boneless buffalo wings. She enjoyed them but I didn't like the fact that they only put 2 celery sticks on her plate. I mean come on!   I got the big tavern double burger for $6.99. It looked good but you're just paying for cheap meat. It tasted like it was still frozen. It didn't have any flavor what so ever and looked like it has been sitting for awhile. I usually finish my burgers but this was the first time I actually hated it. Very disappointed.  And to put the cherry on top, there were waiters and waitresses arguing about money, tips, tables. I had no idea what was going but they made a scene right by our table. You could sense the tension of the workers and that they were talking behind each other's backs.

Ours was covered in a sticky substance as well. Then we sat at the table for 15 min before any of the three servers who were around our table even looked in our direction.  Again, this is 4:00 in the afternoon, not a terribly busy time. A bunch of other servers were sitting in a booth eating and in their phones in between their other tables. Well, we finally got served, but it took 10 min for my daughter to get her apple juice since that came from the bar. Then when my order came out, it was wrong.

The individual chains can't control that.  Went to this location for lunch yesterday with my boyfriend. It was the awkward 2pm time so the place was empty except for maybe 5 tables. There were 2 waitresses. Ours was Lori. Fantastic service! She could have easily been overbearing with her 2 tables but she wasn't. She gave me a drink suggestion which I thoroughly enjoyed.

The bad: My wife and I have been there four or five times now. And the service is just consistently terrible. Times are longer than normal to order, get our food, refills, getting the check, etc. Occasionally you can see a waiter/waitress that's trying really hard...but the place just isn't very well run.

17,Joely G.,"Kenosha, WI",95,2,,1.0,2015-06-27,"Use to love this place! Specially because I'm a vegetarian and I can get veggie burgers many different ways. That is until they started slacking horribly. One of the best things at Red robin is the endless steak fries. They use to have buttery garlic Parmesan fries... they were to die for. Better then their dry over salted french fries. Then one day we get told they will no longer make the garlic fries for anyone. I pitched a fit, and the manager said all we had to do was ask for the garlic fries the old way and they would be GLAD to make them for us. (PHEW.... its the reason we regular the place). Then the burgers started going down hill. Lots of mistakes were made, like asking for no mayo and getting it or saying I can't have rye bread for the patty melt because I'm allergic and being served it, then having to wait another 15 min for my food. This wasn't once in a while either, it was every single time... always something!!!!!! It was getting very frustrating going in there and having nothing but problem after problem. Then the other night (after not going in or ordering for over a month)  I went to call in a HUGE order that would have made them 80-90 dollars and asked for the garlic fries only to be told they no longer carry butter to make them. I hung the phone up after canceling the oder and looked at my family confused then called  red robin back and asked to speak to a manager. She got on the phone and told me she was sorry the guy lied to me, but to be honest with me..... they had the stuff to make them, BUT if they made the garlic fries for me they would have to make them for everyone. (seriously, how hard is it to toss some fries in garlic butter???) She was sickly and sarcastically sweet about the situation saying she wanted to help, but she would have to talk to the manger higher up. She offered nothing what so ever to satisfy the situation except excuse after excuse. So I told her that I was really sorry but I would take my business elsewhere.  I told her that their new garlic herb seasoning (season salt) was no substitute for actual garlic fries (which by the way was an extra charge.... a dollar or 2 per order, so it's not like we were getting it for free, yes we paid for them to toss the fries in garlic butter).  So I'm sorry to say, but because of the constant mistakes, and excuses they lost my entire family, and quite a few of my friends and co-workers also. I suggest you spend your money somewhere where the business actually cares about their customers!!!! There are plenty of GREAT places in Kenosha and surrounding area that will do just that too, and without the fight, hassle, or excuses.

We came here after he was discharged from the hospital as it's a comforting place to him (familiarity). My father went to the restroom after being seated and as he is diabetic he checked his blood sugar and injected his insulin, like he typically does. We ordered food. After over an hour wait and watching food just sitting under heat lamps, I asked to speak with the manager. If anyone knows how insulin works, it's very time dependent or my father could easily have low blood sugars, become extremely ill and potentially need medical assistance. I spoke with the manager and stated we have been waiting over an hour for food, that my dad was diabetic and explained the insulin situation. I also have a stomach issue where timing is important between liquids or else I become very ill or if too long between, I may become dehydrated easily. The manager had a very rude attitude and stated, ""Well you should have informed your server about this."" I said that maybe informing guests how long the food wait is would be appropriate. She became defensive and repeatedly stated we should have told our waiter than walked off. No apology, no anything. That is very poor customer service and as a result, although my dad enjoys this location, we will spend our money elsewhere in which they value their customers. This experience turned me off to Red Robin for sure. If the manager was pleasant, didn't come off as defensive and blaming, a simple apology, I would have no issue with this but I do.

We walked in and were pleasantly surprised to find out that they had just recently renovated entirely, I.e. outside, inside AND the menu. The middle section is primarily decorated like a classy night lounge. We found the new chairs very comfy. This section is set aside for 13 y.o. and older. No children unless the new family section gets filled up. Which is what happened. It became quite loud but the hostess did a great job of placing the families w/kidlets at the furthest point from those of us dining without children. The menu offers a myriad of different variations on the classic burger and some entrees. We ordered the onion ring tower, classic cheeseburger and prime rib dipper; both with endless fries. The food was great. One of the highlights was, and will be, no more baskets where the bottom bun was ALWAYS soggy and gross. Flavor profile and temperature of our food was spot on. The biggest highlight of our meal was Amanda. Her customer service was outstanding. She was fun, interactive and very knowledgeable about the menu.

29,Darlene M.,"Lindenhurst, IL",1,65,4.0,5.0,2016-12-26,Very satisfied with food and service at this location. We ordered our appetizers using the app at the table.  Our food come fairly quickly after ordering and all was tasty. We did ask for basket of garlic fries that was delivered few mins.   Food at these places are pretty consistent.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kenosha,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28
35,Amy M.,"Kenosha, WI",0,98,96.0,2.0,2017-01-15,"Food really good but service not a good experience. It was a Tuesday night about 5pm with 2 other tables in the entire place and our server could have cared less if we were there. We ordered a short order of onion rings and a coke and sprite. Onion rings were awesome and served piping hot, however 2 bites into our onion rings another server arrives with our meals...that's a huge pet peeve of mine. Not giving diners enough time between courses - so our food ends up cold. We ate our meals Banzai burger for me with garlic Parmesan fries and steakhouse burger for hubby with regular fries.  Hubby's burger was over cooked but not like we could say something because our server never checked on us  - not even to see if our meals came out right. Our drinks needed refills and our server and all the servers were huddle in the back corner of the restaurant talking after I looked over about 20 times she FINALLY came over and asked if I wanted a refill. Food is good but service is not worth the hassle with all the other choices in the area. We will dine elsewhere and use our rewards at other Red Robin locations. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kenosha,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16
33,Gary S.,"Kenosha, WI",23,34,2.0,1.0,2017-02-04,"Went there yesterday evening (Friday night). First went to the bathroom - very dirty, paper towel machine broken.  Ordered drinks and after waiting too long for how busy they were, wife got a mojito that was a joke. Barely tasted mint and no alcohol.  Sent back.  Ordered fish and chips, wife and friends ordered burgers. Wife's came out wrong.  Sent back, wrong again. Got her burger when we were finished. My fish fry was a joke for Kenosha. McDonalds Filet-o-fish would taste better. Friends were not happy with there burgers - overcooked.  Do not know if this is just this store or if company wide, but will NEVER return.  Way too many good places in town here at half the price - and much better service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kenosha,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16

24,Teddy R.,"Jefferson, WI",0,35,,5.0,2017-08-18,"They have great service here when I walked in for the first time. Everything is clean and they are always busy. Everyone was very professional in asking me if everything was okay and of course they asked for an ID when I ordered a beer so they are law abiding, which is great! Also the manager walked around to the bar and each table and asked if everything was okay etc. best Red Robin experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kenosha,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6
22,Joe M.,"Milwaukee, WI",25,21,,1.0,2017-08-24,If your looking for a good burger and service I would avoid Red Robin.... customer service is very poor and management is a sorry excuse.  Food is cold and over priced....  I wouldn't go back even with a free gift card,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kenosha,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
23,Lindsey K.,"Burlington, WI",0,10,,2.0,2017-12-05,"Great place if you want an expensive, very bland meal, that had the audacity to only put a total of 6 fries total on your plate. That wouldn't have been bad if their burger was actually good. Both me and my husband will not be returning to any Red Robin chain for the lack of quality tasting foods and their lack of care in where we, the customers put our money. All in all, this Kenosha branch was very clean, and the staff was extremely nice and readily  available for us. So 5/5 on the kenosha!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kenosha,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48

We actually live closer to the franchise located in gurnee but go out of our way to  the Kenosha one.

21,Jim C.,"Kenosha, WI",1,5,,5.0,2017-12-28,"They not only have the best burgers, but the best people. We have never had bad service and were always treated very well. They not only have great burgers but great fries.  And they have ""Bottomless Fries"". Yep while your there for no extra charge they will keep em coming. There are other bottomless menu items as well. I recommend the Campfire Sauce and I even dip my fries in it. When I ordered for take out, they not only have great containers but they also sent a cup of fries to eat on the way home. Prices are great in comparison especially with all they offer. Plus it's just mighty tasty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kenosha,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
