We love their fries, we always ask for a couple refills of it because we like it so much but... we had a couple or I should say.. a few bad servers, but now we know them so we try to avoid them. We did had a few times the same server, I don't know her name but we didn't had to ask for refills on our soda or fries, she was fantastic.  The manager or supervisor is great, I really like his customer service, I wish all the servers were like him.

I had a problem with my Boca burger, which is a common problem with most restaurants (it's really easy to harden the patty-so I don't fault them) and I let them know, just an fyi type thing, not looking for anything in return, since I ate pretty much the whole damn burger anyway.  BUT the kitchen manager (Alan, I think) came out to talk to me about it, and he bought my burger for me.  It was really a  nice gesture, and I'll definitely be back!

The food seems ""assembled"" and not ""cooked"" to order.  Service is awkward.   There is a feeling of ""no pride"" in providing great service and great food.  It's sad, it used to be that way in the 80's when the Kingen family owned. That's before the Japanese bought it and before it went public.  Now it's just another ""crap on the wall"" restaurant.  There are many restaurants that serve a better quality burger that are locally owned and ran by people that take pride in their work.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kent?start=100,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.12

77,Dalin C.,"Kent, WA",134,51,11.0,2.0,2012-10-20,"Came with a group of 4. There was a ton of seating but I believe they were trying to get an area for a party of 20 ready first? That's what I'm going with because perception shapes reality and almost as far as the eye could see, there were open booths. That being said, it took the waitress about two and half minutes to show up to take our drink order. Not that busy, mind you...the party of 20 had not arrived yet. The drinks, two lemonades and a glass of water came pretty quickly. Another of us ordered a hot water which came with a lipstick-infused mug. My favorite! I never trust dishwashers.  What was ordered: Bonsai Burger Riblets and Mac&Cheese Clucks & Fries Tavern Double While we waited, I received my first water refill...which was accompanied with miscellaneous floating remnants from...who knows what or where. Well, I mean, I suppose it'd be easy to deduce where but anyway...  I never trust dishwashers. Food all came within about ten minutes. From what I hear, everyone's food tasted good. Ill just speak on mine: riblets and mac. The macaroni was just your basic run of the mill spiral pasta and cheese sauce with cheddar cheese melted on top. It was baked, but for a couple minutes too long. Some of the noodles were crunchy. Not my bag. Then again neither is crisp(ier) bacon. In the end, I was eating macaroni and cheese and well...life is good when you're eating macaroni and cheese. There was also coleslaw on a bed of lettuce. I had a flavor issue with this one because I kept tasting onion. Texture was decent, however. The riblets had a nice tangy sauce draped all around the meat. It was the meal's saving grace. Meat was tender enough, not tough, but still didnt give me that marinated for hours and cooked to perfection feel. Ribs were small enough to go down in two to three bites. One if you wanted to Scooby Doo it, which wouldn't have been hard. Oh yea, the water was good. When it was water. And not accompanied by other stuff i side. Didn't have an after-taste either, which I'm a fan of. We had a young server. High school. So she hadn't been taught to care or remember things yet. She asked us if everything was ok about five times within a 15 minute period. At one point someone asked for an additional piece of lettuce because the lettuce that came with the burger was this dilapidated and rejected by all the other lettuce kids piece that really just...should have been in a salad. Waitress forgot about it. Then the spare lettuce from another meal was used and when we told the waitress we were good to go, she comes back with two and a half large ""Honey, I Blew Up The lettuce"" pieces. I seriously could have fed three rabbits and a guinea pig. Life actually seemed better when the waitress didn't come around. But...like I said, she's young and couldn't be bothered with...remembering things. One day...  Red Robins tend to get crowded quick and the booths aren't super huge. So put your left-handers on the inside if seated next to right-handers. Don't complicate life. A very large portion of the staff is young and up and coming in the work force so keep that in mind if you ever go here. You're not going to get five star service, but someone could surprise you. Never know. Considering its a Red Robin and they are rated #1 for Best Burger in some category I cared not to remember I should have gotten a burger. I mean, hey, the fries are bottomless.And who doesn't like a good bottomless fry? So why not a 5 star: lack of cleanliness (lipstick on mug, leftover from the last thing that was in there stuff in the water pitcher), sub-par and untrained customer service, and average tasting meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kent?start=60,2.216,2.216,2.216,2.216,2.216
79,Nancy C.,"Renton, WA",14,242,44.0,3.0,2012-12-21,"Visited in a Tuesday night. Merely an ""okay"" experience. Our originally dinner plan failed us so we resolved to Red Robins. It was our first time here and may be the last since there are other closer RR closer to us. This one was just out of convenience. We got dearly rather promptly, at most a 5 min wait. Party if two adults and a child. The place did look a bit pack and that's probably due to the timing we arrived.. HH.  Nonetheless, we got seated and few minutes later a sweat dripping waiter came by to assist us. We ordered our drinks and meals. Kiddo got the chuck chuck chicken (don't recall actual name of the fried chicken strips) freckled fruits and a soda. I got a burger (forgive me for not recalling any actual name..) that had fried onion, mushroom,  horseradish touch to it. My husband got the seafood platter ordeal.  We waited and understand it was probably a busy hour so food might take awhile and we appreciated our sweating waiter offer us some fried as we waited.  He came back but with the little ones' food. It was a nice gesture that they didn't want the lil one to be hungry. Unfortunately the time gap between our kids food and ours arriving was too big of a gap.  My husband said it would've been nice if we could eat with our son..  So another words, our kid was almost if not nearly done before our food arrive. We get our food, the burger was alright for me. Hubby enjoyed it more than I did. Fries were ok, some were not done enough.  The place appears to be ""okay"" overall. I do have to mention that this particular RR doesn't have the togo cups for the kids meal as they once did/ other places offer.  Now correct me of I'm wrong, bc I/we haven't gone to a RR for nearly 6 months, things may have changed OR it could've been just that particular franchise that decided to opt out on the kids meal togo cup for drinks. Even though there were no kiddie cup, they had a kid size plastic cup with a lid on it. Which does mean something for us. It's a necessity (in my opinion) makes everyone's life easier.  So like I've mentioned, we may stick with the RR in Tukwila or try out the one at the Landing.  Shall I mention, beginning of our meal/half way thru our waiter did wipe those sweating beads off his face and forehead. We give the guy an A for effort but everything else combined is what lead my review to a 3 star review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kent?start=60,2.412,2.412,2.412,2.412,2.412

One reason is the parking lot. I'm pretty sure there's more spaces in this dedicated lot than restaurant capacity. I never have to fight for a parking space like I do in Bellevue, Renton, and Tukwila. The other nice thing is its big enough that I never have to wait more than five minutes for a seat.

72,Lei L.,"Renton, WA",58,107,24.0,2.0,2013-06-13,"This review is for THIS PARTICULAR Red Robin location. I've always had great service at other Red Robin restaurants but this one in Kent really pissed me off. First our group of 4 walked up to the bar and a server told us we had to leave because we weren't 21. She saw a kid walking into the bar in front of us and automatically assumed we were with the kid. She said it really loud too in an alarming way- like she was shocked we would think to even bring a kid to the bar. Everyone at the bar stopped and looked at us and I told the server we didn't know who the kid was and we were definitely over 21, probably over a decade older even than she was. Thanks for embarrassing us and then only giving a small apology under your breath! Our server herself was nice but it seemed she was stretched thin between multiple tables. But she took our orders pleasantly and another server brought our food and drinks. We asked for more dipping sauces but never got any back. I also asked for a small plate. That never showed up either. Essentially, after we got our food, none of the servers really checked on us or our drinks until we were practically done with our food. They were however busily helping the other tables.  A bus boy also noticed my friends shirt that said I  Love Guns and Coffee and blurted out ""I guess you're a liberal!"" Excuse me? If you are going to blurt out something political at least get it right..it's being a conservative! Not a liberal!  And it' was just one of those funny t-shirts. It doesn't at all dictate the political view of the person wearing it! While we were eating the bartender even yelled ""Is it closing time yet?!?"" Wow, really, there are customers at your establishment- good job making them feel you have to keep working! It was 2 hours from closing time! We asked for the bill, tipped and left but the whole experience was just horrid. We should have left the second the server assumed we weren't 21.  Servers need to get checked here. Don't tell everyone your opinion. Politely ask for ID if you are not sure  of the age of your customers. Don't make assumptions of your guests. We don't know you. You don't know us. We are there to eat. You are there to serve. We stuck to the program- we ordered, ate, paid. The servers there need to get with the program. I'm giving it two stars because the food was just as good as other Red Robin. Yep, no stars for service..just for food. The other three stars were eaten away by horrible service in a service industry business!  PS- we tipped the normal amount based on the bill. We really are too nice!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kent?start=60,2.84,2.84,2.84,2.3120000000000003,2.84
91,CJ B.,"Bothell, WA",0,9,10.0,2.0,2013-08-25,"Edit 9/26/2013:  The general manager gave me a call to request some additional information and resolve these issues.  He was genuinely surprised that cleanliness had deteriorated so much, and has not heard similar reports from other customers - but because he was very sincere in both his apology and commitment to correct these issues, I'm increasing my rating to 2 stars.  I'll definitely write another review if I decide to visit this location again. - - - I hadn't been to this Red Robin location for a couple years, but stopped by this evening with a few friends.  The restaurant wasn't very busy for a Sunday evening, perhaps 30-40 guests between the restaurant and bar, and plenty of staff:  Two front-of-house hostesses and several servers. There are several important parts to this review, so I'll jump ahead to the most important first: - Overall cleanliness has decreased significantly at this restaurant since the last time I was here.  Menus were slightly greasy, the on-table drink menu had large pieces of food/mayo on it, every single plate that arrived was covered with substantial greasy fingerprints from the cook staff. - The Royal Red Robin Burger no longer has a fried/fully cooked egg on top - instead, it's over easy, and on a burger re-make that I ordered, the white was so runny that it soaked into the bun. - Burgers are now served on a smaller plate, with a metal ring to hold the fries vertically.  This is probably a good thing for America's growing waistline, but fry portions are now ~50% smaller. - Burgers are about half the thickness as previously used.  Tonight, all our burgers were pre-frozen, but our server did not know if this was a permanent change, or why they changed.  It also raises the question of food safety for burgers with pink in the middle, since it's more difficult to get a frozen beef patty to 160 degrees while leaving pink.  Pre-formed/frozen patties are also much more dry than fresh burgers. Ok, on to our visit: The first thing we noticed was the drink menu was quite dirty, with several large pieces of food/mayonnaise on it.  We just handed these items to our waitress and she apologized. Most of us ordered burgers;  Two of us ordered the Royal Burger (bacon cheeseburger with a fried egg on top).  The other person ordered his with a little bit of pink, and I ordered mine well-done without mayonnaise.  When our food arrived, a different waitress brought it, but didn't know which order was which - we helped her examine the burgers and determined which one was missing the mayo.  But they got the burgers switched - mine was quite rare, all the way to the very edges.  This is gross (personal preference), and possibly not safe to eat if the temperature wasn't verified. Unfortunately, we were unable to get the attention of a server for ~10 minutes, so most of my party was half-finished with their burger when I was finally able to send it back. Our server did offer me an extra plate of fries while I waited, so at least they showed that they don't hate their customers.  (+1 star). The manager brought my replacement burger, and he must have just come in from a smoke break - the cigarette smoke as he spoke to us was extremely strong.  (Everyone at the table could smell it, but since he was talking to me, it took my breath away). They did cut the burger in half this time, so I could see the meat was done.  But as soon as I bit into the burger, I had a mouth full of raw egg white.  It was soaked into the top bun which made it soggy with raw egg.  I couldn't get the attention of any servers or the manager again for more than 10 minutes, so I ended up just not eating the burger. Eventually when it came to pay the bill, the server did not ask any questions about my un-eaten burger.  She also didn't ask if I'd like a box, so she must have known something wasn't up to par with the replacement burger. I don't think any of us will return to this Red Robin location again;  Perhaps we'll give the Tukwila location a try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kent?start=80,2.88,2.88,2.88,2.3440000000000003,2.88

114,Kenton S.,"Lakewood, WA",119,7,4.0,3.0,2013-12-31,This review is nothing bad about the service of our server. Rather my major complaints were with the management and support he received.  Our server once he noticed (known told him we were seated) that we were seated in the bar section came right over and began to take our order and told us about the special. (Tavern Tuesday or something). Our food was prompt and hot. However I had ordered a dipping sauce with my fries and it wasn't with the food. I told our server and he quickly tried to get me the sauce however in the time we sat down. Our server got 7 more tables. I used to work in food service so I know how hard it to juggle a few tables and he wasn't getting any support. I also think that the management might want a little foresight and maybe have more than one person on the floor for happy hour? I never got my sauce and our server was genuinely upset. He did discount my check (which was unnecessary) I do want to say good job to the server to pull a 3 star review out of a 1 star experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kent?start=100,2.88,2.88,2.88,2.444,2.88

3,Liz C.,"Santa Clara, CA",434,506,2328.0,3.0,2014-03-21,"Honey mustard.  That's probably mine and my boyfriends most favorite thing from red robins. The honey mustard sauce that you dip your fries in is so darn delicious! I came here with my boyfriend around 8 pm and they seated us in a corner. We didn't really like that we were in an isolated corner so we asked our waiter if we could be seated elsewhere and she was so sweet about it. She let us pick any table that we wanted.  Once we were seated we got our menus. They have changed quite a bit since a couple years ago. The menus are now in nice little booklets and they have a few new entrees, appetizers, and burgers for you to try.  I always get the gourmet cheeseburger whenever I come here. Cut in half, well done and with pepper jack cheese. I think this burger has a classic taste to it, and the relish is so good. However, the burgers have gotten smaller since the last time I came here, which was a year or two ago.  My boyfriend got the burnin love burger. It has a nice hot kick to it. A year or two ago, they didn't put a jalapeño right on top of the burger. Now they do. If you're not afraid of the heat, bite right into it.  In the past I have tried the tavern burger. Which is the smaller burger and the cheapest one. It has double the meat plus a lovely sauce. I actually think it's a pretty decent cheeseburger.  Then there's the ciabatta chicken burger. This was good. It was my first chicken burger that I've ever had and it was lovely. Great sauce and the bread is great.  The arctic cod burger is really good if you're craving fish n chips and a burger at the same time.  The royal red robin burger is also a treat, especially if you like a classic burger but with an egg AND bacon! Yum.  If you don't like the meats, you can also try the boca burger. Red robins does a decent job in actually making the boca burger and it doesn't taste fake at all.  However, nothing beats the unlimited steak fries. It's just so good and you always wanna ask for more. Don't be hesitant to ask for more honey mustard too. Now they give you the fries in a nice metal ring cup, but once you ask for some more they start coming out in baskets. It seems they tried to make it a bit more fancy.  Our waiter was amazing tonight in giving us excellent service. She was always there when our basket of fries were low and always asked if we wanted more. Overall though, it's your classic burgers and fries, nothing too extraordinary but still worth going to. I also recommend getting freckled lemonade if you want a drink. Nothing bears strawberry lemonade with actually strawberries in it. And for an appetizer, the tower of onion rings is the way to go.

Once we got settled at a new table, she gave everyone in my party of 4 a menu, even my little sister who's eight except for me. Then she turns and looks at me and asks me if I would like a children's menu. My family and I were so shocked and appalled, especially because I am adult. We went to the manager, my stepmother and I separately, but nothing was done except a crappy apology from the manager. The only reason why I gave two stars was for our waitress who was very nice.

We had a mistake, on our part, and Kristina graciously took away the erroneous item and reordered the correct item. The correct meal arrived quickly. Additionally, I substituted steamed broccoli for the fries with my Arctic Cod. The broccoli was unadorned, plain, but just right tender. The cod was eh, the meat so bland that my normal squeeze of fresh lemon juice required dots of tarter sauce to give it taste. The batter coating was hard, not light and tender.  My husband had a burger of some form on a gluten free bun that was very good. He had no complaints, except after he took a few bites and realized some mustard would be helpful, no one was around to get some for him. The chicken in the Clucks and Fries were deliciously moist but the fries were barely crispy after a few minutes on the table. Ditto for second and third helpings of fries, no crunch.

I try my hardest to not eat at franchise restaurants but this place was close by when we wanted to eat lunch. We were greeted very nicely in the bar section by our bartender/waitress. For drinks we ordered Blue Moon and Freshly Squeeze beer. For lunch we ordered the Barbecue Chicken Wrap with fries and the Guacamole Bacon Burger with garlic herb fries. The chicken wrap was perfect and the wrap was very good as well. I loved the garlic fries it is an additional .99 cents to upgrade so not a big deal at all. I think the best part is the extra sauces you can get to dip the fries in.

It took us about 45 min to get our food. We weren't given any silverware or napkins originally and had to ask. Once our food had finally arrived we were given a total of maybe 5 sauces when we had each ordered 2-3, so had to ask for more. All of our food was room temperature by the time we got it. Pretty sure our server had forgotten about our food. One of our burgers had a rock hard bun, not sure if yelp allows videos but I have a video of us tapping it because it was so hard. Had it sent back and we were given that burger free because of that. I had my guacamole bacon burger sent back to be reheated because it was wasn't warm anymore, everyone else just decided to eat their room temperature burgers and fries. Had to ask for fries multiple times because they were taking forever, same with napkins,  strawberry lemonades, and then eventually our boxes too. The table next to us had their food taking forever too and were complaining to management. Tried to order a desert and the order was never put in by the staff person, so had to ask two people for the order only to be told probably 20 min later that they were out of ice cream for it. Everything took forever, my drink was never refilled, none of the food was that great or very warm, someone's mojito was watered down, but our server's attitude was always positive.

We ordered our meals, and an hour later, we had only received bottomless fries, which of course the kids ate all of. Our waitress ignored us and wouldn't even acknowledge us and we were the largest table there. We had the manager, who was very friendly look into it. We finally received our food an hour and 20 minutes after we had ordered. My friend from Idaho had to show up at the restaurant because we were still stuck there. There was something wrong with every single meal we had ordered, which was almost embarrassing because the kids were frustrated, my family, I was very disappointed, it was probably the worse experience I've ever had at a restaurant. The manager was kind enough to knock off a good chunk of the bill for the ridiculous wait time and poor quality food, but I will take my business to the South Center location from now on.

42,Camille Y.,"Spokane, WA",19,10,,1.0,2015-10-11,"Was on my way out of town and we thought we'd stop in at RR for a gourmet burger.  This was last Friday at 12:30 pm.  We went into the bar, because we figured it would be faster.  The bar wasn't crowded, but the booth we sat in hadn't been bused yet. A guy came by and said, ""how was your meal?"" We told him we just got there, so he took all the dirty dishes away.  Waitress came by and took our beverage order, water and Tea.  After about 15 minutes we got our beverages, and told her we'd like to order. Ordered 2 gourmet burgers.  40 minutes later we are still sitting there, and there seemed to be a lot of wait staff standing around discussing something. By this time other customers are trying to flag them down and inquire about their orders, or pay for whatever they had already received.  I heard the waitress say to one of them, ""can't do anything about it the server is down, you'll have to wait.""  Again there are RR employees standing around having a discussion about their problem.  At this point my friend went to see what was going on.  The waitress just waved her away, even though there was a whole line of burgers sitting at the cooks station.  At NO time did a manager come by and let anyone know what was going on.  By this time we had been sitting there for almost 2 hours, so we got up and left. I told the waitress we were leaving and she gave me the ""shoo-fly"".  So we left.   I used to patronize the RR frequently since I live nearby.  Both my son and daughter-in-law worked there while in school.  I know that RR corporation has some high standards for their employees...or they used to! This whole fiasco was ridiculous. If they would gave told us immediately about their problem, would could have been on the road 2 hours sooner. As we walked out, the greeter was turning people away....lucky them! I won't go back to this RR again. (After reading most of the other reviews, this RR must be having serious issues.  Hopefully the corporate offices will look into it.  One store can can ruin a franchise reputation.). Also, my log in says I'm from Spokane, that's because I logged on to Yelp when I got to Spokane, but I'm from Kent and live right across from this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kent?start=40,2.28,2.28,2.28,1.988,2.28

When I got it, it was like they took an order of their clam chowder, and then put a cup of water in it. So we asked the manager about it, and he said it was because they made the clam chowder to order, so it doesn't have time to thicken. Which I find to be a pile of bullshit.

Came back out medium at best but that's okay didn't make that big of a difference, and the reason why is most likely the patty just isn't very thick. Hard to do on a thin piece of meat.  The Ramen ""bun"" was interesting, It legit tasted like cup-o-noodle ramen without the flavor pack. I think they could have upped their game by toasting that ""bun"" for a little more crunch, it would add a little color and appeal to the plate as well. The aioli used was the highlight of that burger honestly, bring in more pickled carrots and daikon (like a lot more) and make the meat bigger and this might be a winning sandwich.

The manager came by to check that it was cooked but never offered to comp anything.  But just as frustrating is the noise level. We couldn't hear each other and spent our dinner trying to read lips. My 5 year old daughter had to lean into my ear for me to hear her. I realize this is a family friendly restaurant but it's just ridiculous. Chuck E cheese would have been quieter. We had tables on both sides with screaming children and totally checked out parents for our entire meal.  I honestly don't know what red robin could do about this except have the manager ask the worst offenders to step outside with their kids.

After we were seated - they continued to chat in the corner instead of take our orders, bring us drinks, etc. I have GREAT experiences with other Red Robins across the US so I know it's not a company wide issue.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kent,2.4,2.54,2.54,,2.484

I had a long day today & it pretty much started off on a bad note...but this changed for the better when i pulled into this location. My server's name was Christina & right off the bat her upbeat attitude was simply amazing. I can't express how much I appreciated her genuine care for guests (not just myself as I noticed). I will definitely make this my regular stop when I visit friends in Covington. People like Christina are very rare to find, it's not easy to come across individuals who can sympathize with strangers.

25,B S.,"Seattle, WA",2,28,39.0,3.0,2017-01-20,"Kent Red Robin is okay. I gave it 3 stars because of our awesome waitstaff; whether we are in the bar or at the other seating area, our waitstaff are always super helpful & attentive. Our favorite works in the bar so we always sit there unless we're w/ our daughter.  I think her name is Danielle? (I'd give you 5 stars girl)  Anyway; today we just had drinks & appetizer. We ordered the Canadian Pontine Fries. They. are. bomb. The gravy is so flavorful & thick. They pour a white cheese sauce around the fries which make it even better. There're fried cheese curds, which, c'mon, make everything better. It's amazing that some of the fries stay crunchy even after they've soaked in this thick-gooey deliciousness called ""gravy"" This is a clean franchise that we enjoy going to. The reasons that I took away 2 stars: #1.) I ordered a Boca Burger. Which, I have had a numerous amount of times. You know a Boca Burger by the taste, the gritty seeds and other things you feel when you munch on it. Boca burgers are yummy & can never be mistaken... Well. This wasn't a Boca burger. It was a turkey patty. I know this because of the color, taste and texture. Ground up grey meat; Turkey. I know it. Well. They served me this and tried to tell me that it was Boca. I'm sorry but we can agree to disagree. It was not a Boca Burger it was a turkey patty which I don't eat. And on another occasion I ordered the fish burger which fell completely apart (like it got defrosted too long before cooking) and I had to eat with a fork. (Boohoo, first world problems) Overall this is a nice Red Robin.  *Sit in the bar if you want faster drinks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kent,2.68,2.57,2.57,,2.614

It wasn't overly busy, but it was still loud. I think it's just the way the building is designed that carries the sound. The food was pretty good and the fries are endless so you can eat and eat to your heart's content.

As we were leaving the waitresses accused us of leaving without paying but this was not the case. She did not investigate before accusing us because It's possible that it was a different group who she was referring to. Management needs a lot of work!

I ordered a burger with bacon and My fries were displayed in such a way, it was literally just tossed onto my plate, not in those little tin holder things they're usually in. Whoever plated my food just did not give a shit. I ordered a sprite with my food and the waitress passed by my table several times without it, it was also hard to flag someone else down for a fork, another menu, more water, etc.  It doesn't make a difference if I'll be back or not because these are chain restaurants, so the employees can keep working with such shitty customer service.

Every time we come here we have to wait a really long time to be acknowledged by a server. I use to serve tables myself.

I also ordered a well done burger and it was very pink. I got about 5 fries that looked like they were thrown on my plate.

We ordered and asked for some pink in our burgers. Both were well done. It doesn't surprise me since we could hear the cooks and servers hoot and hollering in the kitchen. They were all goofing around and were very loud. I suspect there wasn't a manager on duty and if there was, he or she should be fired! At one point we heard our server go back to tell them to quiet down because she still had customers close by.

We waited for 45 minutes and the restaurant wasn't even busy. We watched two parties leave and confront the staff on why there is such a long wait and there's so many open tables. Literally half the dining area was empty. The hostess was no help at all. Has no answers for anyone and just sat there staring at whatever she was looking at. When we finally got seated we had 3 different waiters helping us. They were late to bring out beers, late to bring out food. The table next to us sat around for 15 minutes after there were done with their food for someone to bring them a box and the waitress forgot and they left frustrated. We spent 3 hours here total!

24,Esly V.,"Kent, WA",70,9,3.0,1.0,2017-11-25,"I ordered Togo tonight Sunday 11/25 I bought a lot of food, and we ordered online so it would be perfectly in detail what we wanted without any mess ups. I get there 9: 40ish and the lobby is empty the bar was pretty empty as wel, the rest of the restaurant sounded quiet but there was no hostess and nobody acknowledged me for at least 10-15min. Once they did they asked me to go into the bar then very rudely they sent me back to the lobby for not having my ID on me when they clearly told me to go in there...... I get my food about 10 minuets later, and I start checking it because I'm already annoyed at the unprofessionalism. I was missing a side of fruit my burgers were placed wrong no big deal. Online I added garlic fries and jalapeños (extra cost) on my southern charm, it had no garlic fries or jalapeños and it was chicken instead of beef. I told the lady and she fixed it nicely. We waited at least 20 minuets to get the burger, I'm pretty sure the lady forgot and the hostess ended up handing it to us after she asked what we were waiting for. I am very dissatisfied because my meat was not cooked all the way, the feeling of it in my mouth was disgusting. They fix they're mistake and give me something not eatable in my perspective  I don't think I will ever come back, I rather drive all the way to Covington or Federal Way.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kent,2.52,2.48,2.48,,2.496

Come out to dinner with my family and my Dad's burger was not cooked correctly, while trying to flag down a server to assist with our dilemma, they all walked by oblivious to the world around them. Is this a family friendly environment? It's starting to be put into question now. Of course the manger offered their sympathies but before they came over someone remotely turned off my server request beacon, in my opinion that was rather rude.

23,Janelle R.,"Federal Way, WA",167,3,1.0,1.0,2018-01-03,"I came here for lunch yesterday around 12pm and the service was far less than average that I've received at previous locations. I sat at the bar alone and waited to be greeted.  First strike- Two employees were standing in the corner gossiping/laughing for about 5min until one of the guys decide to walk over to me. ""just you?"", ""only water?"", ""you ready?"" - these are some of the few short brief communications that I had with the waiter. It was as if he was trying to have as little conversation with me as possible. Very non social which is fine but it came off rude.  Second strike- when he brought out my food my fries were completely cold as if they were sitting in the kitchen forever? But there was only me and two other parties in the restaurant so they weren't too busy to make a new batch of fries. Third strike- it is very off putting when you see a waiter handle money/cards/etc and then proceed to not wash their hands/wear gloves to make a customers drink and put the straw in their cup with their bare hands all over the straw. I was excited to get a milk shake and didn't order one because I saw how unsanitary their waiters are. bad experience overall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kent,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44

It came thin as water and when he asked for crackers they brought him a slice of toast and said we don't have crackers!!! I ordered the four cheese melt sandwich and it was so hard it was difficult to bite into. I think my fries were the leftovers over cooked and cold.
