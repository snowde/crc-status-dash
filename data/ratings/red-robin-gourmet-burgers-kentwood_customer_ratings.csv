35,Travis L.,"Gainesville, FL",22,160,11.0,4.0,2012-01-07,I love Red Robins.  This location is exactly like the others in the chain offering a fun atmosphere and food at a great price. Suprisingly they have a fair amount of healthy options with wraps and salads.  I had the bbq chicken wrap and it was very good. They also have a long happy hour 3-6 and 8 to close with half off apps so make sure to get an onion tower.  They also offer free refills on steak fries so dont be afaord to ask for them before the food comes.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kentwood?start=20,2.9920000000000004,2.9920000000000004,2.9920000000000004,2.9920000000000004,2.992000000000001

The 1st soda's we got were a bit off so she traded them out right away! The girl who brought out our food seemed a little put off and she handed me each plate & had me pass them to the appropriate person which I thought was a tad bit odd being a guest and not an employee but my arms work so I did it.  The bathrooms were quite nasty, couldn't use them so we let them know as we left, hope they cleaned them! The burgers were fine, fries were mostly decent.

Well, for starters, I found a large piece of brownish colored paper in my bowl of chili...halfway through eating it, GROSS! I don't know exactly what it was or where it came from, but I found it VERY UNAPPETIZING, to say the least! To their credit, the manager did come out and apologize, but they did not offer a discount, which is the norm when you have a bad experience, such as this, at a restaurant. They only asked me if I would like another bowl of chili...uh...NO THANKS! This isn't the only reason, it was just the last straw. The place used to be great, but it seems to be going downhill fast. The service is getting worse, the place is looking more run down and uncleanly overall (including sticky tables), and the food doesn't taste as good anymore. The peppercorn burger, which used to be really good, now seems to have a strange, unappealing flavor. Maybe it's paper! :O Sorry, but I have officially crossed this off of my list of places to eat out. :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kentwood?start=20,2.724,2.724,2.724,2.724,2.724

My kids get either chicken on a stick or Mac and cheese with broccoli but they also have several other healthy side choice, not just fries. What we love the most is that 2 of us are gluten free and very sensitive and we feel completely safe eating here. If your child has any food allergies let your server know and the manager will come out with a binder of allergy menus, and can explain it. The fries can be gluten free because they fry them separate from gluteny items. Also, the manager will bring your food out personally to make sure everything is correct. Once they set my fries down and immediately recognized a problem, stating they may have touched the other fries so they went back to the kitchen to get me safe fries.

Service was lackluster. The bartender didn't acknowledge me until I flagged her down and seemed reluctant to get me a beer.  The burger I got was great - had a whisky sauce and fried onions on it. It came with endless fries but the bartender didn't seem all that enthusiastic when we asked for a few more orders. The portions of endless fries are ridiculously small to share for two people.

10,Dan V.,"Grand Rapids, MI",0,45,,5.0,2016-11-08,"It's been 2 or 3 years since I had last been to a Red Robin. I remember it being, meh...good not great. I had recently gotten a free burger coupon for my birthday month and decided to go with my wife and year and a half old daughter. Figure a free burger couldn't hurt. I am SO glad I went. Menu: The menu has some classic favorites as well as some fresh ideas. Typically I find myself interested in one or two burgers, I literally thought about each burger on the menu. Plus, the kids menu is probably the best thought out kids menu at any restaurant in GR. Variety of drinks from soda to juice to milk/chocolate milk. There were several different entrée options from burgers to fish to spaghetti to chicken skewers...sides (also bottomless similar to adult sides) had fruit, raw veggies, fries and much much more. We may go back just for the convenience of the kids meal option alone!  Food: AMAZING! I ordered a burger (forgot the name) that had bleu cheese, steak sauce and onion straws. It was EXTREMELY flavorful and a solid medium doneness as requested. My wife got one with two smaller patties and mac and cheese in the middle. She also really enjoyed that. Ordered my daughter chicken skewers, she crushed them.....Not all of them because she's not even 2, but she enjoyed what she could. The fries were pretty good. Im more into smaller and less fluffly fries than the steak fries, but that's a preference. These were good. I had found out you could do a dipping sauce for free so I got buffalo which was pretty good. Even better was dipping them into the teriyaki glaze that came with my daughters chicken. That was legit!  Service: Service was perfect. I want to say my servers name was Krissy? Either way, probably the best server I've ever had....anywhere. Drinks were always full. She made sure to contact us. Always used ""my pleasure"" instead of you're welcome. Her communication skills were on point. Very friendly and outgoing.

Usually I never need a refill on fries but I thought it was great that he brought us some straight off the bat. One of our meals was taking a little longer to cook so he brought us another refill on fries before our dinner arrive. I enjoyed the Bonzai burger (as always).

Let me elaborate. You go here to get a good burger at a fair price with nice  service. Will your tastebuds explode from sheer giddy happiness from a torpedoed of flavor?

3,David M.,"Grand Rapids, MI",23,15,3.0,4.0,2017-05-18,"I first tried Red Robin when I lived in Sacramento. I was an instant fan with the Buffalo Clucks and Fries. For the longest time, it was the only thing I ordered off the menu in spite of them being known for their burgers and bottomless fries. When I moved back to the Midwest, none of the places I lived at the time had a Red Robin. Eventually they built one in Grandville, MI about 14 miles away and was able to add them to my regular routine. After the success of that location they built a second one in front of Woodland Mall.  Woodland Mall was the location of my latest dining experience. First of all, the parking for any restaurant located just outside the Mall's south entrance/exit sucks. The restaurant does NOT have its own designated parking area. I could end up having to walk a significant distance and since I don't have a handicap placard it is rare to find parking that doesn't make this an adventure all by itself. So after a walk across five rows of parking and a large cement slab filled with restaurants and a movie theater I finally arrived inside the restaurant.  The staff is very friendly and I was seated immediately. Someone took a drink order and it arrived quickly and stayed refilled throughout my visit. I order an A-1 Peppercorn Burger which came with fries. It was cooked well done as requested. Came with fries which seemed a little cold. I had also ordered a short stack of onion rings which were piping hot.  I am someone who enjoys ketchup on the side when eating my fries. The restaurant provides bottles of ketchup on each table. Of course, mine was empty. And really this is the only complaint out of a satisfying visit and the reason the rating wasn't higher. I did ask the server for another bottle of ketchup and waited almost 20 minutes for her to return with it. Now she also seemed to be working the bar as well as the table I was sitting at and I get having to take care of both areas. But there was one customer at the bar and myself. So I'm not going to be kind on this one matter.  And thankfully, even though I was dining on my Loyalty Card, I dodged the birthday dessert and the staff singing happy birthday. Thinking about that, I'll up the rating to four stars because usually avoiding that whole scene is nearly impossible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-kentwood,3.2,3.2,3.2,,3.2000000000000006

I have a mildly obsession with fried pickles and I will say red robins' don't disappoint. they also come on a mountain of fries and are priced at $5. Score! They pretty much always have a new burger they're featuring which is nice if you're feeling explorative. Their burgers are decent.. slightly over priced. The few things I don't like is they only have 3 wraps on the menu and one is stuffed with bbq pulled pork. :/ Not a lot of options if you're looking at the healthier side.. also the actual burger patty can lack flavor but the endless fries/ topping options usually make up for it.

I get that this place is a chain, but it is not one of the better ones for burgers, despite what you may have heard. When I looked at the sources, most of the folks that rate this place highly seem to be the same ones that think a Filet-o-Fish is on a par with broiled swordfish from Leo's. That's fine, but if you really love great burgers (as I do), you will probably not find much to enjoy at Red Robin. The atmosphere is fun and much like a TGIF's. The service is reasonable and was actually very good at my last visit with my kid. The food is mostly what I take issue with, and it seems to be consistently...disappointing. For example, I recently ordered the A1 Peppercorn Burger, with cheddar subbed for the pepperjack and a request for the bacon to be ""crispy"". The photos from the menu lead you to believe you're in for a big, tasty treat  but when they serve it up, you know you're in for a letdown straight away. The burgers are not horrible by any means, but neither are they ""Gourmet Burgers"". In fact, they are as far from Gourmet as an elementary school band is from the London Philharmonic. My burger came out looking like a portly fellow had accidentally sat on it. Looks can be deceiving, however, so I bit into it and I became just as sad as the wee baby above in paragraph #1. Bland meat. Soggy bun. Even soggier onions smashed into a little ball, tucked under the sad burger patty. The bacon tasted as if it had been microwaved partway the day before and had been left sitting under a heat lamp to keep him nice and warm, but not at all crispy. I instantly imagined the cook looking at the ""extra crispy bacon"" request and chuckling to his coworkers as he tossed the limp pieces from a huge bin onto my ""Gourmet masterpiece."" My side of broccoli was ok, but it tasted as if it had been sitting in a butter and salt hot-tub before being plated. The only good thing about the meal was my kid's steak fries (the fries and the service were what actually got the review bumped to 2 stars.) Lastly, I tried the ""Chocolate Fruffles"". Basically, brownie stix dipped in chocolate and sprinkled with salt. They tasted ""meh"" but were very dense. I literally felt as if I had been eating chocolate-dipped wet cement. Despite being very hungry, I chose not to finish them. My kid was happy with his milkshake, though. All in all, I wouldn't say this place is as bad as McDonald's, but it is really only a tiny step up. If you're by the mall and have a starving kid, it will do the job, but if you are searching for a really great burger - most anywhere else would be better. Reeeeed Robin...
