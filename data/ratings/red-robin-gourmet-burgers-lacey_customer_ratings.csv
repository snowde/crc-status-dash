77,Jay P.,"Lacey, WA",0,13,1.0,2.0,2013-06-17,"I came here to order a burger to go. I haven't been to a Red Robin in ages and I was interested in the ""Gourmet Burger"" sign. They are new but fully opened, not just ""soft open"", but they didn't take ""to go"" orders. The reason I heard from the waitress was that they didn't want to ""overload"" the kitchen. The logic puzzled me, ""to go"" or ""for here"" I would still be putting in one order, so the kitchen would have the same load. I think the real reason behind it is to make the restaurant looks ""fuller"". I waited a total of 35 minutes from walking in the door to leaving the restaurant with my order ""for here but in a box"". I ordered the Burnin' Love Burger, well-done. It smelled so good in car and I thought, ""OK, this is worth it. I will enjoy my burger"". I got back to work and opened up the box. Everything still looks OK, the bread buns look good, french fries look good, and I took my first bite. This is where things went down hill. The only Burnin' sensation I had was the burning desire to scream for my 12 bucks and 35 minutes of my life back. It was not well done and if stale lettuce is ""gourmet"" then I hit the jackpot.  Perhaps the newest of the restaurant is a factor here; however, if they are not ready to grand open then they should soft open. Anyway, I love food and I would pay whatever to get good food. I didn't get a good hamburger from Red Robin that day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lacey?start=80,2.9200000000000004,2.9200000000000004,2.9200000000000004,2.9200000000000004,2.9200000000000004
112,Josh B.,"Lacey, WA",256,907,6238.0,4.0,2013-06-26,"This Red Robin is a moderately brand new addition to Lacey in the new shopping center that is right behind the Safeway on Marvin Rd. We went to this Red Robin at about 5:30- 6:00 pm. Many people might think it would be super busy, but the wait was only like 10 minutes, which I didn't think was too bad at a peak time. Alas, we only had two people in our party though, so we were easy to seat.  I always love Red Robin, but I tried not to go in with a bias in my mind. We were seated and our server came very quickly to take our drink order.  We got pretzel bites as an appetizer. They were good, but nothing super special. Then the party started....literally. There was a table of about 8 next to use with multiple birthdays and that same ole Happy Birthday song and dance we all are privy to came as the servers gathered and wished the little kiddies well. We joined in and clapped, laughed, sang, and smiled our way through the song along with other in the restaurant. It's kind of amazing how fun it is. Don't be awkward, join in, even if it's not your birthday. It makes people feel good :) Anyway, soon after the entrees came. I ordered the basic Boca burger. The burger comes disassembled with the pickles, onions, & tomatoes on the side. I am not sure if they have the endless fries anymore because we got like 10-15 steak cut fries with the burgers in a little silver ring. They used to bring them in a basket and they truly were endless. Maybe, as someone mentioned, this is a privately owned franchise so maybe they're cutting costs where they can.  The Boca burger and also the sides (tomato and pickles) along with the fries were dry. The burger itself was edible but seemed as if it endured the same cooking procedure as the regular meat burgers, which normally tends to dry out boca ""meat"". I'm glad we got onion ring sauce and barbecue and ketchup. It helps to moisten things up.  I think there are still some things that are not operational or not trained yet like to-go orders. Or maybe they just don't do to-go orders when its peak hours to minimize the amount of extra work in the kitchen. Anyway, our server was able to make a ""to-go"" order happen for us. I am giving 4 stars, or really 3.5 stars because of how fast the whole process was, how fast the food came out, the short wait at a peak hour, the food was decent but not overwhelming, the service was nice and friendly and informative. Stars subtracted because that parking lot is going to bad once there are more businesses in there and a half a star because the food was only decent and not overwhelming as well as there were only 2-4 items for vegetarians.  Oh and on a side note, I was kind of bothered that of all of the three TVs in our section, all of them had the same sports game on. It would be nice to have a little variation and have each TV with a different sports game on. Or maybe not just have a ""sports bar"" feel as families are actually coming there. Maybe put on a sitcom or NBC or something. Just a note",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lacey?start=40,3.088,3.088,3.088,3.088,3.088

73,Jim T.,"Bellevue, WA",5,45,,4.0,2013-08-24,"We were in Lacey after a visit to Cabelas, and starved! Short wait for dinner, about 5 minutes. Place was packed at 8pm on a Friday night, and stayed busy. First impression was poor. While we waited, the manager walked in the front door, snapped his fingers in a hostess's face and barked, ""Kim, come!"" as if she were a trained dog. Appalling behavior and no way to treat staff. She and the other staff seemed unfazed by this, so I have to assume it's normal behavior for him (and them). But we were starving, so we took out seats. Rest of the experience was terrific, best we've had at any Red Robin. Chelsey was an amazing waitress, prompt, professional, cheerful, cute as can be. We told her how hungry we were, so she took our order and then immediately brought us hot, fresh steak fries. Awesome! We had burgers, Both were fresh, delicious, cooked just right, and the best we've had at a Red Robin (or maybe anywhere, save LunchBox Laboratory in Bellevue or Gordon Ramsay BurGR in Las Vegas).

My friend and I went to the bar since the restaurant was packed. We ordered drinks and appetizers to start. My friend ordered the pretzel bites and asked for mustard instead of cheese, I asked her if she could bring out the cheese as well so I could taste it. The pretzels came out with just the cheese, no mustard for my friend. It took her awhile to come back so we could tell her about the mustard. When she returned she saw my friend's soda was empty and asked if he wanted a refill. My alcoholic beverage was empty as well, but she didn't ask if I needed another drink. Our meals came out and I wasn't happy with the salad dressing I got. I waited and waited for her to come back so I could request a different dressing. By the way, I still didn't get another drink. After waiting so freaking long I lost my appetite and stopped eating my salad, and when she finally walked by I had to tell her that I wanted another drink.

We were sat to the right of the door and we were cold our entire visit.  The lobby design was a stupid move on the architects part.  The door lets cold in every time the door opens and it goes straight to the dining area.  Red Robin is a busy place which translates into cold drafts into the dining area every few minutes. I had to keep my down jacket on the entire meal.  That sucked. Our server was pretty aloof and non chalant and we didnt seem much of him.   My fries were lukewarm and I counted 8 on my plate. No joke.  I hate that their ""bottomless fries"" means you have to act like a pig and ask for two orders to make up what would be a usual amount at any other restaurant. Not only do you have to ask for more but it takes 5-8 minutes to get them so your burger is mostly gone by the time you get them. This annoys me so much that I about done going to Red Robin. Just put a regular sized order on the plate and stop saying they are bottomless. It is a stupid gimmick and is just annoying. Burger was good. Meh.

The fries were doused in grease ( don't get me wrong, I know fries aren't healthy but I also know there ways to drain a little grease).

I ordered the California Chicken Burger, and the food came out quicker than I expected. Great sandwich, and I opted for broccoli instead of fries. The only suggestion I have is that their broccoli is somewhat plain and has very little seasoning. It would be much improved if they steamed it with some sort of garlic butter or garlic seasoning. The chicken burger was great, though!  Be sure to join the Red Robin Royalty program.

126,Dallas L.,"University Place, WA",0,1,,3.0,2015-11-20,"I'm giving this review 3 stars because Alan, one of the managers here was able to make things right at the end of our service and his actions help upgrade this review from a zero star that it should have gotten.  Basically our service was crap. Got seated and waited over 10 minutes for anyone to come take our order. Waitress says they were all confused and didn't know who was supposed to be taking care of our table so no one did. Ordered drinks and Chili con Queso for an appetizer. Got cold cheese with something white floating in it and about 6 chips.  Got our food and all my wife ordered was Sweet Potato Fries and they were cold, soggy and dark like they had been sitting for an hour and then reheated. She immediately asks for new ones and we got them. Then we both run out of our dipping sauces and a manager asks us if we need anything and we ask him for more sauce so he leaves to go get it and we wait and wait and he never comes back. Then our waitress stops by about 5+ minutes later and we ask her for the sauce that the manager was supposed to bring and then we wait and wait for her to come back and she does finally after another 5+ minutes with the wrong sauce. So we wait and wait again. At this point it's been over 15 minutes that we have been waiting for just some ranch that we can't get. Our food is cold and our patience is gone.  Then Alan comes up and asks us if we need anything and we tell him to just forget it and we are done. He asks us what is wrong and we tell him what's been going on and that we come here about once a week and this is the worst service we have ever gotten and he promises to make it right. Alan first tried to bring us new fries and all the sauces we could want but we told him that we are done at this point. So he then offers to comp us our entire meal and he gave us a gift card worth $20. We were pretty damn irritated before Alan came along, but he did a great job at making it right for us and his actions are the only reason we would consider coming back again. He was also working his butt off trying to help the waitresses as much as possible and I got to say that Red Robin is lucky to have him for a manager.

105,Vanessa G.,"Lacey, WA",0,1,,2.0,2015-12-20,Two stars for terrible service because our waiter took a while to get to us initially. When he took our drink order he took forever to bring them to us and brought us an extra drink we didn't order and charged us for it anyways. When my mom asked for sweetener he passed by us more than a handful of times and never brought her any sweetener for her tea. Knowing he would take forever to get back to us even though he kept passing by I went to the bar and got a beer and asked the bartender for one of the many sweetener containers behind her. I asked for fries to come out before our burgers so we can snack on something he never did that. He brought me a side of fries with my burger which didn't make any sense since its bottomless fries so the side of fries got cold but My husband and I just took from that side after we finished ours. What really annoyed me was the fact that he blamed the Seahawks game for his acting like he had Alzheimers (no offense). He brought a different burger than the one my husband ordered and charged us for that too. I was taken back by how inconsiderate he was being and to top it all off everything we told him to fix on or ticket (I.e. The extra drink charge and the more expensive burger he did not bring out to us) was not fixed. AND... When my husband was done he asked for more fries and those never came either!!

We have been here a handful of times and my one complaints is, they always seem to bring out food before any silverware is put on the table. Every. Single. Time.  Besides that, the burger is comparable to any other Red Robin's we have been to. The hubby and I get the same order every time: double order of fried mushrooms, two side salads, and a banzai burger cut in half with fries. The fried mushrooms are really juicy and delicious, I always ask for ranch when ordering or they take forever to bring it out. The side salad is a big size and the perfect start to a meal.

Aside from the expert level of uncomfortable that he provided, our waiter failed to bring us much more than that. No drink refills, no checking on the food, nothing. 3. The burgers were just basically just warmed up garbage. I can honestly say that I've had better tasting burgers from fast food places. The tomato slices were basically see through and they were still twice as thick as the bacon. The actual burgers themselves were closer lukewarm patties of pink play dough than anything.

Sure, I understand with a group this size that things do not always run as smoothly as a 4-top but that being said, this may have been my worst dining experience EVER. Eight people on one end got their orders. I'm figuring the rest of our food will be out soon. No such luck. By the time the remainder of the party got their food, the first eight were finished. Not to mention that my burger AND FRIES were barely luke warm. We also ordered a pasta dish off the kids menu that came out last AND was wrong. Since when does pasta become pizza? Maybe an older child would not have cared but an eighteen month old doesn't do well with a slice or two.  When it comes time to pay the bill, they give you an electronic gadget instead of a check. Nope, doesn't work too well when we have five parties paying separately. Took 20-25 minutes to get the checks figured out. So much for free bottomless fries....wasn't even going to wait for that.

Even during busy times, we have never waited longer than 10 minutes for a table. Granted, we're a table of two, and easy to seat!  The service here has always been phenomenal, and we've even had a few servers remember us from previous visits! The food always arrives hot, fresh, and shortly after ordering. The burgers are rather large, and they come with bottomless steak fries, which is great if you have a huge appetite like us! They also have Ziosk tablets on every table to make paying a breeze! You can split the bill, swipe your card, use the built-in tip calculator to decide on an appropriate tip, and even print your receipt... all right there at your table!  And for those who aren't sure what to order, you can't go wrong with the Whisky River BBQ Burger! If you're looking for an appetizer, the O-Rings are a classic, and the campfire sauce is a must try. And as for alcoholic drinks - the Blue Moon Shake and the Irish Beer Shake are to die for! If you come here often, or plan to come here often, I would highly recommend signing up for the Red Robin Royalty card. It's free to sign up, and you can get some amazing perks, including random specials/discounts, every 10th burger free, and a yearly birthday meal! Free food?

So i decided to try this location and goodness I'm not sure if I will go back :/. It's like walking into god damn Ikea there are walls everywhere. I was asked ""hey buddy do you know where the restroom is?"" I said sorry I have no clue. Ordering drinks was fine. We ordered are food and it took longer then I expected.  For some reason some guy  (not are waitress) brang out like less then half of are food. I'm guessing they ran out of room on the counter or something so after a few mins the people that got there food where finished. After waiting 10 more mins they brang out more food and one person apparently got the wrong order the first food drop off and another person in are party was supposed to have that one. Well that order was not what anyone ordered so it was wrong so she takes what's left of the Half eaten wrong order away and probably throws it away so now that one person still doesn't have anything. mean while I'm done and all of the condensation from my drinks are going onto the table and running off into my lap for some reason all of the tables are not level. Meanwhile are waitress asks if that person would like there salad and they say yes few mins later salad comes and it's almost completely brown. how do not notice the gross salad when making it. Apparently are waitress tried to get the manager to come over and talk to use but they wouldn't come. She kept saying I'll check on that order but didn't give us a time estimate (ETA) She came over to check on us and asked if everything is alright. Um where missing an order. After waiting an extra 25 mins we finally get that order and she apologized a lot and took off that order from our bill. By that time EVERYONE was done so we said f*** it lets box it and get out of here. We waited for a check and after finally asking she said to do it on there table tablets so we finally figured it out and paid and the damn thing was completely out of receipt paper so no receipt. :( The food was actually pretty good other then the bad salad. Our waitress was so nice and apologetic. nothing was her fault. she deserved the tip we gave her and I would like to thank her.

I was at the bar for the Hawks game, decked out in an early 2000s Tatupu jersey. I'm by myself, one of two women in a sea of men, & a random dude came over to me, standing quite close & leaning in, & asked, ""Can I get you a drink?"" He had a Patriots tshirt & jeans on. No name tag, no apron, no Red Robin tshirt- so I didn't think he was an employee. He looked at me expectantly, & I was confused & a little uncomfortable- was he hitting on me? Did he work there? So I asked: ""Wait, do you work here?"" Affronted, he said, ""Yeah, isn't it obvious?"" I replied, ""No, you don't have a name tag or tshirt like all the other employees do."" He stormed off & came back two minutes later with an apron & a tag on which he'd written ""Red Robin Employee.""  He leaned on the table & said, ""Better?"" I said ""Well, now I can tell you're an employee."" He said, ""Good, I wish there was a way I could tell if you were a Hawks fan before 2012. Football existed before then, you know,"" & pointed at his Patriots tshirt.  ""Wow, you're hostile,"" I said. He smiled, leaning in even closer, & said, ""Drink order?"" He eventually brought my drink, but refused to serve me food, telling the bartender that ""I didn't like him."" She came over & helped me. I told her the exchange- she wasn't surprised by his behavior, saying that he tended to think he was ""God's gift."" Turns out his name is Matt. (Ladies, beware!) She was super nice & checked in on me for the rest of the time I was there (a couple hours- the duration of the game). He disappeared from the bar completely.

I went alone the following week to catch another game and was treated differently (by a different waitress with dyed red hair) I wanted to watch the same game on the same channel I knew they had and the waitress was not ""tv smart"" when using the guide option and I would assist her with directions but was getting rudely angry at me because she could not and would not listen to me claiming they didn't have the channel.  Finally got the channel and quickly left. Can easily tell she did not want to be there.

She said they do have a garden burger, so I asked if there's any way for her to find out if the patty contains wheat. She said she didn't know but that if I called back and selected 'option 1' to place a carry-out order that they would probably know the answer to that question. I followed her instructions, called back and selected 'option 1' to place a carry-out order and asked the girl who answered the phone the exact same question, explaining that their website was not letting me view the menu. She said it served on a wheat bun, I said oh I know but you guys have the gluten free bun option... what I'm wondering is if the patty itself contains wheat. She said she didn't know because she doesn't work in the kitchen. I asked her if there was any way she could find out for me and she said the only way to find out is to look online at the menu. I said, so you're telling me the patties don't come in a box with an ingredient label on it that you can have someone look at for me? I even mentioned that I could call back later, to give her time to find the answer for me.  I'm extremely dissatisfied with the customer service at this location. I've had issues with them in the past and have even had corporate reach out to me to try to resolve the issue. The employees at this location are all very young and immature, every visit has resulted in long wait times for food and drinks, employees are always horsing around and socializing takes priority over customer service.

Long waits to get something to drink is one of my pet peeves and both times it took more than 15-20 minutes to get us some refreshments. Our waiter completely disappeared for a long while after taking our order. We assumed he might have had a shift change because we went about 30 minutes without getting appetizers or even seeing him. Luckily a waitress had noticed our food was up so she brought it out for us, all except my sons food. I always ask for the kids food to be brought out as soon as it's ready. Kids can only wait so long.  Anyway, The waitress blamed the waiter by saying he didn't put it in the order but came up with his food almost immediately after we asked for it. I honestly think she just missed it when she grabbed the rest of the food. She did the waitress thing and asked if there was anything else we needed, I asked about a drink I had ordered from the bar and didn't receive. She said she'd get it right away but never came back. Anyway, we didn't have much service that night. It was as if we had fallen through the cracks. Surprisingly about 10 minutes before we were done eating, our initial waiter walks by our table and smiles at us and asks if everything was going well. I was with my parents and they're pretty polite so they didn't say anything but smiled and nodded. Didn't get drinks or fry baskets filled which was a bummer, I like to stuff my face with fries at Red Robin's. My drink showed up at the very end in case you were wondering.
