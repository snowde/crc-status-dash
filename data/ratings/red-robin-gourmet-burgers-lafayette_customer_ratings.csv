14,Brittany S.,"Breaux Bridge, LA",38,26,64.0,4.0,2016-07-17,The seating is ridiculously cramped. Other customers kept bumping into other customers' chairs. We could barely pass between tables. The food was prepared right and was good but didn't meet my expectations. I asked for another round of fries that never came. But we will give them another chance and try it again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lafayette,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.736

7,Ray C.,"Baton Rouge, LA",27,144,331.0,5.0,2016-07-22,Loved my visit here.  Great food and decor.  I was seated immediately with a restaurant full of people. I ordered the blazing burger. It was delicious and very spicy which I love.  There is a few different types of dipping sauces to choose from. I picked the sweet Thai. It was great with my fries.  Definitely will stop in again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lafayette,2.7079999999999997,2.7079999999999997,2.7079999999999997,2.7079999999999997,2.7079999999999997
28,Sean A.,"Ventura, CA",0,14,,1.0,2016-07-24,"Absolutely Wretched Service!!!! My family and I walked in at 9:40 pm Sunday evening..... When we told the hostess we needed a table for 5.... She went to go get someone else working there.... And the lady that she went to get, said all the servers had gone home for the evening and that it was closing time and there was nowhere to seat us..... That is absolutely poor customer service on all fronts!!! If you're open until 10pm on a Sunday evening..... Then you should be seating until then.... We are not looking for a free ride or meal.... Just wanted to try this place out.... Now our family has no desire to eat there and will inform many of our friends that the customer service here is poor!!! If y'all intend to thrive in Lafayette.... Y'all's game plan had better improve extremely fast!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lafayette?start=20,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18
12,Brooke S.,"Lafayette, LA",0,7,,2.0,2016-08-13,"My family and I went last night and our waiter didn't write our drink orders down which was fine bc i know they can remember that stuff easily, my mother asked if they had limes and he replied ""yea you want a water with lime right? Yea boo ive been doin this a long time dont worry about me, i see you"" None of us knew what to say because it was so incredibly awkward.  The refills didnt come until we got out check. The fries werent bottomless which is what i think of when i see red robin. They brought out the wrong meal on my sons order. All and all it was anxiety ridden and not a good experience at all.  Wouldnt recommend. They just really need some new help in there.  The burgers tasted fine.

26,Stuart B.,"New York, NY",0,4,,3.0,2016-08-18,"No complaints about the food. But after we arrived & waited 10 min, I had to go to the bar to ask for someone to come wait on us. I had even pushed the Call Server button on the table device. The waitress who finally came I recognized as the same one who had been close by several times but never looked our way. The request for sugar for tea had to be done to another server because our server was gone for so long.  From what I could see, other wait staff were much more attentive.

10,Chanda O.,"Lafayette, LA",100,37,,1.0,2016-09-01,"This was one of the worst experiences I have had in a long time. For a new place in town, you have a lot to work on. I finally went to Red Robin after hearing rave reviews from my friends who have been to Red Robin Restaurants in other cities. I was extremely disappointed!  When I walked through the door, I did not receive a friendly greeting from The hostess. That should have been my sign to turn around and leave. I did not like anything I ordered. -Purple pear lemonade. (Awful) -Bold boneless wings. (Not hot. It's as if they were sitting out for a long time. -A1 Peppercorn Burger. (A burger place with terrible burgers!) -Garlic fries! (Less than okay) What you need to work on: -Friendly hostess. -Wipe down your sticky menus. -If you would like your customers to use the tablets at the tables, clears the screen, when you are cleaning the tables. I will not be back. I will not recommend Red Robin to anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lafayette,,,,,
6,Vicey R.,"Scott, LA",24,120,253.0,5.0,2016-10-06,"Was impressed! I read the reviews but still wanted to give this place a try. At 2:30 in the afternoon... Glad I did! Our waiter sorta looked like Chris Rock, he informed us about the menu, how the robins worked, he even joked about if our food didn't come out quickly he would go cook it himself, the place was clean and the bathrooms we very clean. The food was great! Loved the garlic fries with the garlic aioli. Whiskey burger was amazing! No complaints and excellent service. The manager came to our table to ask if we enjoyed our food and experience and we truly did. Red Robin was great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lafayette,,,,,
18,Eldred B.,"Lafayette, LA",18,11,,1.0,2016-10-07,"Finally got the chance to try this place out and I'm not impressed. We waited for 20 minutes to find out we couldn't have a table. Story below... We arrived around 7 and from the start I could tell it was going to be a rough visit. The host could not hear me  when I gave him my name for the wait because the music was too loud. I received a lecture about why it's important to give your name to the host so he can call you when your table is ready. Because he could not hear my question of ""do you want my last name or first name?"" (a question I only asked after realizing he was having trouble with my first name, Blake.) He apparently thought I asked why he needed our name. As if I've never been to a restaurant before.  So he tells us it will be a 15 minute wait. We sit down and watch as a few more couples and families walk in and then right back out. About 20 minutes pass and a different hostess approaches us. She rolls her eyes a few times during the conversation, clearly not happy to be at work and talking to people. She informs us that her manager has told her not to seat anyone else because the kitchen is getting backed up and needs a break. That it was up to us to decide if we wanted to wait and see what happens or leave and eat somewhere else.  So, we left. Thanks for nothing! I've been wanting to try this place for a few months and now I don't think I ever will. First impressions are the most important and y'all blew this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lafayette,,,,,

(It had about $10 on it which is the entire reason I went there) but then they forgot my Mac and cheese. Drove all the way back (about 10-15 minutes away) and they didn't offer anything for the trouble. Just excuses. Terrible customer service. This is the second time I've gotten to-go from here. The first time, they took 30 minutes, I couldn't get help with the kiosk they use for people to pay, and the food was cold.

11,Yelp King ..,"LA, LA",1,141,175.0,5.0,2016-11-06,"I am VERY picky when it comes to hamburgers, and this place exceeded my expectations. I got the burger that comes with a fried egg, and it tasted so good. Their menu is HUGE, so it's kind of hard to choose what you want, but that is never a bad thing! Also, you get FREE refills on the fries :-)  I will be back again, and again, and again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lafayette,,,,,

I'd go back for the bottomless fries but I have yet to find a burger I like. I do have restrictions on my diet so maybe that's why. I wouldn't know what their burgers taste like. I had a BLT with gluten free bread. The first time I went I had a garden burger with gluten free bread. The bread tastes good but the meat & the garden burger is not so great, very bland. Even the BLT was bland and that surprised me. Like I said if I ever return I will only order the sides.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lafayette,,,,,
17,Kelly U. N.,"Prairieville, LA",38,24,8.0,2.0,2016-12-26,"This is the second location we've tried & both are not worth it. We went around 4:00pm & it was not busy, yet we waited (what seemed like forever) for our 2 burgers. I ordered the fried pickled appy & it came out right away...and it was a tiny portion. And the waiter told us our burgers would be McDonald's size paddies, so we upgraded our burgers to the ""big"" size. And after a lonnnngggg wait, we were not impressed. I got the ghost pepper burger with an egg and I made my burger with the wedge lettuce wrap bun & got a SINGLE leave of lettuce on top and a few small pieces on the bottom, to hold my burger together. And my hubs bacon burger looked like a regular burger, barely any bacon. And it was flavorful at all. And the bottomless fries (we got sweet potatoes fries), you only get like a handful at a time. So it seemed like a burden to ask for more fries after you've waited so long. We love to eat out and don't care how much it cost, as long as its worth it.  Much rather 5 Guys burger or Mooyah's. And service is much quicker.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lafayette,,,,,

24,Tammy K.,"Lafayette, LA",48,3,,2.0,2017-04-30,"Have been to many Red Robins in other states and had great experiences.  However, this location was a huge disappointment.  The service was horrendous.   started off ordering a child's meal and an appetizer.  Child meal came out fast which was great, but child was finished eating before appetizer even came out.  Server sat down on a chair while taking our entree order ( very unprofessional) and rudely questioned my choice about my salad when I asked to omit certain toppings and again when she repeated the order back to me,  ketchup bottle empty and asked 2x for ketchup, never came and ended up grabbing bottle from another table which was also practically empty.  Asked for napkins, took forever, brought out salad when meal came, not prior.  Table top kiosk not working properly so took forever to get check.  Restaurant was so cold had to go get jacket from car.  Lady behind me even had her coat on backwards to warm her arms and child at another table complained to parent she was cold.  Was told corporate controlled temp so they did apologize for temp.  Ladies restroom had one stall out of order, a second not flushed and a third out of toilet paper.  The soap dispensers were empty so begs to question if workers are washing hands properly.  So for two burgers, one child meal and an appetizer, our ordeal lasted nearly  2 hrs and the sad thing is they weren't even busy.  The food was delicious, and I do eat out a lot, but i rather spend my money where I get good service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lafayette?start=20,,,,,

5,Jonathan C.,"Lafayette, LA",7,84,5.0,2.0,2017-05-30,"The office closed early today so my coworkers and I decided to try Red Robin for lunch. We had the rest of the day which was good because this it took a while here. It would not be an option for a usual work day lunch. Having never been here before I tried the Smoke and Pepper Burger which got a full page in the menu so I figured it must be one of their better offerings.  When I got it I was somewhat let down, it met the basic requirements of a good burger, the meat was juicy, the bun was ok, but that is where it ended. I didn't find anything special about this burger and that was disappointing. The whole meal, pre-tip, was about 15 bucks which is to much for an unremarkable burger. My coworkers got different burgers and they felt the same way. There are just too many burger places in Lafayette to eat burgers that don't ""wow"" you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lafayette,,,,,
9,Jodie B.,"The Woodlands, TX",65,7,1.0,1.0,2017-06-01,"We were very disappointed overall. Service was painfully slow even though there was only 1 other table. They had already dumped the tea an hour before closing, and when I finally got my food, it was swimming in grease. No exaggeration, I picked up my burger and the grease from the fries was coating the bottom bun and dripping off back onto the plate. They did replace the bun and wipe off the oil. However, the food just wasn't good. The burger tasted like charcoal and fries were dripping oil. There was a manager looking type walking back and forth, but never checked on us - even after the burger had to be dried off. For almost $100 meal, I am beyond disappointed. We will not be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lafayette,,,,,
23,Lisa B.,"Rayne, LA",0,7,1.0,1.0,2017-06-01,"Horrible pretty much sums it up. Burgers ordered well were rare to medium rare. Bun was soaked in grease and the fries..terrible. Beer was lukewarm and service was slow. Meanwhile, the ""manager"" was sitting around playing on his phone while our waitress tended the bar, made drinks and waited tables. And to top it all off, extremely expensive for 3/4 of our food still remaining on the table when we decided to leave this horrible establishment.

1,Mark L.,"Lafayette, LA",89,475,581.0,4.0,2017-06-10,"I have been to this location several times and others many times as well.  This location is obviously new and for that reason I held off a little before reviewing.   Nice surprises.  The menu has expanded and they added many more items like Pub Mac n cheese which was delicious.  All of appetizers, burgers, chicken strip and deserts we tried were good.  The onion rings and pretzels were somewhat unique and we enjoyed those a lot.  I want to try the fried pickles on a future visit.   One complaint is that the fries were Luke warm and not hot like everything else.  The bar is really nice except the seating (tables for two mostly) is pretty tight.  The tables are also pretty full by the time you get an appetizer and two entrees on them.  You might ask for a table or booth outside of the bar area unless you want to watch TV.   The service was very friendly and the food came out blazing fast.  It was a Monday with only about 20% of the restaurant occupied but even at that it was fast.  Overall it exceeded expectations and was better than most other locations from memory.   Enjoy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lafayette,,,,,

I don't mind paying for amazing food, but with all the other places in Lafayette, they need to step up on their seasoning or drop their prices! The pictures look amazing but the food isn't.

Once they left, she was slightly more attentive, however, anytime we asked for something additional, she was real salty. The food is way overpriced. My steak on my sandwich was way too salty. I didn't eat it at all. The mac and cheese was pretty good, but hardly any cheese. My son's dessert had no ice cream, which she comped, but only after my daughter complained that it wasn't worth $6. She refilled our drinks, but otherwise didn't seem too worried about our needs. 2 adults and 3 kids ate 4 burgers, a sandwich, 2 additional sides, 2 desserts and 3 sodas for $100.

So when my eldest Grandchild insisted on going to Red Robin, I have to say I was surprised how nice it was. It looks like a proper restaurant when you walk in. It is decorated very nicely. We were greeted right away at the door, and seated in a comfortable and roomy booth for the 4 of us.  Our Server was Darius.I hope I spelled that right. He was very attentive considering that fact he had quite a few after school tables. We all got something different and it was all very good. Nice and hot when it came out to us as well.I let the Grandchildren order because, apparently they are well versed in the menu. The menu was very large with a lot to choose from and not just Burgers. I ended up getting the fish and chips. They were really good. As well as the Calm chowder soup. My daughter got these little Meatballs on a stick, the sticks were mini bread sticks. I thought that was a brilliant idea. See it does not take much to make me happy. The kids were all happy with the Burgers and fries, which they even give you free refills on the fries.
