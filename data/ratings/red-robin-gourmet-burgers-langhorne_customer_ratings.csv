Every time I go here I never want to eat there again, but I will go to a different one, think they are good-then go back to this particular location and hate it. I went last night and it was a disaster. The layout is just off...and it is always the loudest, sloppiest mess of a dining experience. I ordered a Boca burger in place of beef patty and the Boca burger must have had freezer burn because certain parts were like biting through wood. The service was not so good either. We were out drinks and only got refilled after we asked for the check. I think of I am in the mood for eating at this franchise, I will take the extra hike to the neshamanny locaton and try my luck there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-langhorne?start=60,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006

86,Elisabeth C.,"Summit, NJ",338,376,36.0,3.0,2012-12-13,"We came her after being at Sesame Place. The burger wrapped in lettuce was really good. The fries were good, if a little salty. I also had a freckled lemonade, which I asked to be a third lemonade and the rest water and it was delicious but would have been far too sweet otherwise. I have been to Red Robin in the past and thought the onion rings were good and a shake delicious, but this time I only had the above, Our toddler was the happiest I have ever seen her at a restaurant. It was noisy and there was a lot to look at. She ate her mac and cheese and was exceedingly happy. Our server was adorable and super attentive. His name was Tim (I believe) and he was great with kids. I avoid chain restaurants on the whole, but I believe that different establishments of the same chain can vary hugely and I can say of the 2 Red Robin's I have been to, this was the one I would return to because of the service and the vibe of the environment. We were seated within 5 minutes, and the whole experience of being there was pleasurable. I will say that I know it is not the best food to eat, and that I felt kinda gross the next day, but it wasn't where I ate but what I ate that was the problem.

22,Gerald S.,"Newtown, PA",1012,2191,6425.0,3.0,2013-09-23,"While I generally like Red Robin Gourmet Burgers for the consistency of the food in all locations, I find that this particular restaurant being very close to Sesame Place has a noise level just on the other side of comfortable.  Given the choice I prefer the newer facility close by Neshaminy Mall, which although smaller, is more modern and offers a cozier roadhouse feel.  Too, perhaps because of so many kids eating grilled cheese sandwiches, the signature burgers often are not finished to the desired degree, and present in less than tantalizing form.  Last time I was here my server did not ask how I wanted my burger done. I volunteered that I like it medium, but it came out well done anyway.  Maybe that was why I wasn't asked.  I also was not offered the endless fries that are so heavily advertised.  The burgers are okay in both places and the fries still better than average. The shakes are a bit underwhelming compared to their competition at Cheeburger Cheeburger, Nifty Fifty, and Jakes Wayback. Better to stick with the alternatives like bottomless limeaid or iced tea, where you can hydrate without the sugar rush, and even share the drink if one of you gets water.   It is likely better to come to this shop after Sesame Place is closed for the season, and some quality control is reasserted.  This place is a gold mine usually filled to capacity. Sometimes that success goes to the bottom line, but gets lost in the kitchen and on the floor.

Worse. It had recently snowed about 6 inches and the place was dead, staff was lackluster at best.   Our server was very obviously not thrilled to be there and a bit absent minded.  She disappeared for quite sometime, while we were sitting there watching the rest of our party eat.  When she came back she apologized for the wait, ""she was taking the trash out"".....umm.... eeeew. I understand it is something that needs to be done, but I don't want to hear about it from the person handling our food... I don't know if you washed your hands or not, and besides, I am sure it was a cover for going out and smoking, which whatever, but come up with a less gross lie please!   The food quality was even worse than what I have had recently in AZ.  All of us that ordered beef sent it back because it tasted foul.  I understand that fries are ""unlimited"", but perhaps you should plate more than 8 on a plate with meals.

77,Matt O.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,3,,2.0,2014-06-18,"We were not given silverware when we were seated. We ordered our food, were left sitting there  For quite a long time, maybe 30 minutes, drinks not being refilled, still no silverware when the waitress brought the food. I asked for a refill on my root beer float, took at least 10 minutes to get. Tried to ask for silverware from hostess when seated other people, she apparently couldn't hear me, but the people she seated did. The 2 hostesses were too busy talking with each other. What good is the unlimited fries or root beer floats when your sever never stops by to check on you? I talked to the hostess about seeing a manager, he did comp our meal and give us free dessert coupons for our next visit, although we are not from around here and they are only good at that location. The start time of our meal was around 7 pm on a Wednesday evening, not busy at all. By the time were able to leave with the inattentive staff, it was after 9 o'clock. We frequent a Red Robin at home and specifically asked about this location while we were visiting Sesame Street Place. The service was completely opposite of what I have come to know and expect from the Red Robin we usually frequent. And a small detail, but still annoying: the Red Robin statue in the restaurant is located behind a customer booth in this location. Little kids want to see that statue, and the one we normally go to has it out in the open so little kids (like our own) can go up to it without bothering other people eating.  In addition, probably due to me asking to see a manager, our daughter was not offered a balloon as we left, even though she asked for one. It seemed like once I asked to speak to the manager, our waitress took notice of us for once. So sorry for being an inconvenience to her for wanting to eat at this restaurant, because that's what it felt like.

I have been to many red robins over the years and always loved it. I'm not sure if the cook was having a bad day or what.  I ordered the chophouse burger, which I usually get either that or the whiskey river burger. I ordered my burger medium well and added on bacon. It was supposed to be peppered bacon. I get my burger and tasted a piece of the bacon, and it was burnt. As you can see in the photo it was black. The waitress said she would get me a new burger, I just asked could the bacon be brought out. The bacon was regular bacon with a crap load of black pepper on it. I assumed it would be a gourmet peppered bacon.  So I wait maybe ten minutes for new bacon to put on my burger. As I start eating my burger, there is an overwhelming taste of burnt. I know the burgers are fire grilled but this was too much. I looked on the burger and the outside crust was black all around.

Last night my boyfriend and I went for a late dinner and although it was toward the end of the night, that's no excuse to dine in filth. The floor was covered with garbage and soon after sitting down, my boyfriend informed me there was a piece of lettuce under my foot. Not an environment you want to eat in! My biggest problem though was that my Guacamole Burger HAD NO GUACAMOLE ON IT. So after sitting there for five minutes waiting for our server to check on us, I finally flagged down someone to get it for me. Then I realized our table had no silverware so I had to wait again to get a knife. FINALLY I was able to start eating my burger, except at that point my boyfriend was already finished with his and our server finally appeared to ask us if we wanted dessert. Umm... no! A couple of minutes later as I was about halfway through my burger, he brought us the check which made me feel rushed and I found SO RUDE. A moment or two later, he came back to see if he could close out our check and I firmly said, ""No, I want to finish eating first."" He then asked if he could take my burger out of my way. What part of I want to finish did he not understand?!

We came on a weekend in the winter and it was predominately empty, sat near the bar and had very friendly service. The decor of the place is cool, especially in the bar area. I haven't had a drink there yet, but they have happy hour all week with really cheap drinks (like $4).  There are CRAZY amount of options for burgers including a crab cake one! Here are the two we ordered: Guacamole burger: Huge burger, great flavor, sadly the guacamole was a little less then I thought and with the competing flavors of bacon and swiss it really just got completely lost. Not a bad burger, just too much going on to really enjoy the guac. We got this with fries, which were surprisingly good.  Royal Red Robin burger: I'm almost ashamed to order this burger because I know my heart slows down as soon as I start eating it. It is a deliciously large burger, with a fried egg, bacon and cheese all married on a perfectly toasted bun. Last time I had it, we at at 1 PM and combined with an order of the MOST PERFECT onion rings, it was the only meal I needed all day.  SKIP: The boneless buffalo bites, totally useless, cheap, but not very delicious, tastes like something frozen that's reheated. BUT if you have children, they are cheap and come with chips $5.  The vanilla shake, it was made with that bland generic vanilla ice cream, not like vanilla bean kind, so it was pretty wack, skip that too. I am hopeful about the fancy flavors and adult ones.  Overall, I really like the place, never a wait which is always a plus in my book and reasonable prices on good food. I'm sure I will be back soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-langhorne,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.7359999999999998,3.2000000000000006

I was so impressed with the freshness and quality of the buger and all the toppings. My husband ordered the Prime Chophouse and said the same; the best he has had from RR!

She spoke to the couple next to us three times without acknowledging we were alive. Is it so hard to say ""be right with you?"" We decided to start the timer on my phone to see how long she would continue to ignore us and she must have heard me say stopwatch and she came on over.  So let's take a turn towards cleanliness.... The menu was sticky and obviously wet. We watched the bartender take milk out that had black stuff on the bottom which makes me think there is mold in the fridge rubbing off on it. Then I had to pee and someone had exploded a toilet and there was paper strewn everywhere. And the worst offense, when our burgers came I asked for a knife and Jen had just started the dishwasher. She stopped it, pulled out a knife, wiped it with a dirty rag and then handed it to me. All right in front of me, we sat directly in front of the dishwasher.  You are only awarded the second star because the burgers were cooked perfectly and they accidentally brought extra nice hot fries for people that had already left.  We asked for the check quickly and thank goodness we did bc customer service super star Jen's bar tables has to chase her down at the bar just to get theirs.  Maybe someone needs a refresher on niceness, customer service, and maybe the whole restaurant could use a power wash.  I would not return.

As for dinner my daughter had the Mac and cheese, looked like they just made a box of Kraft. She's 3 so it's not hard to please her. As for me, I ordered the southern charm burger. Was supposed to be one of their best, signature burgers. I wish I would have taken a picture. It was lackluster at best. First off it was very sloppy, looked like it was just thrown together. I ordered it medium, It came out well done. It was less then okay, for $14.00 I expected better. Another thing was the lettuce on the burger, romaine? Shredded, I'm not sure why they would do that as it all just falls off. It's so annoying! The bread was just okay, bottom portion was soggy and if your going to lather sauce on it, toast the bun. The BBQ sauce and mayo combo was good but way too much of it. The bacon was weird, seemed old and not enough caramelized onions. They offer unlimited steak fries, I'm a big fan of the steak fry. But they literally bring you out like 7 fries at a time. Kind of annoying.  Service by Jen was great, she was on top of it all. As for me coming back, I doubt it. I try to stay away from chains but sometimes it's just easier to stop. This is the reason why, inconsistent and subpar food.

I don't want to think about the calorie count of this burger with the aioli and the onion straws...so I did not take advantage of the additional serving of ""bottomless fries."" Husband liked his chili. Some plusses about Red Robin: there's a nice choice of substitutions for fries listed, a choice of sauces for dipping one's fries, and suggestions for lowering the calorie count right on the menu.

5,Sari Marissa G.,"Philadelphia, PA",1625,945,7763.0,4.0,2016-06-30,"3.5 stars. Ok, so the vegan chick is going to review a burger joint. This should be cute. Red Robin, while know for their burgers and scrumptious endless seasoned fries, surprisingly offers a few delicious meatless options and a plethora of healthy ones too!! While I tend not to eat at chains, this is one I feel has a little something for everyone and this location's proximity to Sesame Place makes it a good post-park option for the whole fam. Would I go out of my way to come here? No. But I can certainly appreciate having it as an option versus amusement park food. A healthy one to boot. Awesome.  Besides having a tasty, pre-designed portobello burger meal listed on the menu which I sometimes get, you can build your own healthy burger with gluten free buns or lettuce wraps. They offer vegan Boca Brand burgers, grilled! Yum! You pick your wrapper, then filler, add ins, then sauces. Today I chose the Boca wrapped in lettuce with veggies (lettuce, tomatoes, red onion, cucumbers and pickles) and I added avocado for .99. It was HUGE and delicious! It comes with an endless side all for just for $10! I was very, very happy. I did get the fries because they are just so darn hard to resist so I'm glad I was able to go super low cal with the entree. FYI: The side of fries is 310 calories and the Boca is 100 so your meal comes in under 500 total even with avocado! If you are watching the scale, this is a great place to do so. Their app or site with Adobe Flash (in other words, not in your iPhone) allows you to build your meal and calculate exact nutrition info! They used to have this option for salads as well! I absolutely love this tool and it is a good example of why sometimes a chain can have some benefits a mom & pop business can't.  The kid's menu is a great one too! It offers more than standard kid's fare and each option is just $6 or less including a side and a drink! Pasta, Mac and cheese, burgers, grilled cheese, chicken fingers, grilled chicken and meatballs on a sticks because everyone knows kids, hell, even adults love things on sticks. I like that healthier sides are offered for the kiddos like endless broccoli, freckled fruit salad, side salad and mandarin oranges! Of course my kiddos opted for fries today. They are really that good! It is nice to change it up sometimes and throw in a green which they most certainly do.  They have endless drinks such as flavored fancy lemonades, milkshakes, fried apps and huge burgers with oozing cheese and bacon and such for those fortunate enough to not have to watch their waist. My hubby is one of these lucky fellas. #notfair  Oh, and their beers? They sound AMAZING!!! Funnel Cake and PB Chocolate Porter?! Seriously?!  Oh, and now they have a tablet thing at the table which is use to make paying your bill and ordering easier. I get that, but I actually found it to be distracting. The kids played on it and I kept having to take it away from them in order for them to eat. Also, it charges you $1.99 for unlimited games which I didn't know my sneaky 7 year old daughter hit ""agree"" to when we first sat down. Parents, I would say ask for it to be removed from the table right when you are seated. If they MUST bring it back for you to pay your bill, fine, but really my kids are just fine coloring the old school paper menu page. I actually commented on the ""lets have a chat"" section of the menu which asks ""would your rather"" type questions to ask your children. I thought that was really great! They didn't need the games. Less technology is better sometimes.  **If you sign up for their frequent fan card, you get a free burger on your birthday. Fab Philly Mom says: absolutely bring the kids!

The time was approx. 230pm and the place was half full at best -- we were able to find parking right in front and was told by our hostess (Katie) there were plenty of tables setup and available for us (4 adults, 2 kids, 2 high hairs). That's when the rudeness kicked in. My brother and sister in law tried to wheel their napping 14mo old twin girls to our table. The girls had just fallen asleep after a long, hot and overwhelming day at the park (they're first trip!). Tara the manager immediately came running over to let us know strollers are NOT permitted in the restaurant (mind you this is a chain restaurant servicing a children's theme park community). After trying to plead with Tara, even suggesting to move to an open/less populated section of the restaurant, my family and I were asked to leave. While I understand rules are rules, I believe that a good manager would have assessed the situation and realized that placing the stroller behind our table and away from any foot traffic posed no danger for the customers and staff.

20,Jonathan F.,"Trenton, NJ",5,13,1.0,2.0,2016-11-01,"Hello. I ate at this Red Robin location last night with my girlfriend . We are both vegetarians so we figured they couldn't screw up a burger . My girlfriends Burning Love burger was good , a bit too heavy on sauce so it was dripping and uncomfortable to eat but my Ghost burger with a boca burger patty was absolutely horrible . The patty was rock hard in certain spots and really difficult to eat . The onion rings that I had for my side were overdone and way too greasy. Our waitress was friendly and attentive but I will definitely pass on Red Robin next time .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-langhorne?start=20,3.08,3.08,3.08,,3.0800000000000005
15,Helena X.,"Langhorne, PA",4,90,40.0,2.0,2016-11-02,"I used to come here a lot.  Primarily in part due to my daughter loving this place, I on the other hand do not really care for chain restaurants, especially of this caliber.  However, more recently I have seen a steady decline in the quality of service and food.   Service:  There are some occasions where I get a great server but it seems like that is now a rarity.  From servers forgetting things, forgetting you are there (e.g the whole drop the food and run and never be found again type of thing) and the lack of personality.  Recently, the server wouldn't even let us get in a word in edge wise before trying to control the whole way we ordered.  I get you are busy but we are not incompetent can I tell you my salad dressing that I want before you try to cut me off when I am ordering the salad so I can inform you.  Can my friend inform you she does in fact want fries before you cut her off when she states what burger she wants before you start rambling salad, broccoli, fries, etc. - like this is not the type of customer service realm where you need to grasp control of the conversation and dominate, you are not a telemarketer trying to stick to a script, plus it was rather an aggressive approach to trying to control the manner in which we ordered.  I could see if I was trying to do a whole song and dance in the way I was ordering but I wasn't nor was my friend.  Like get over yourself - this recently just infuriated me, and this happened at the bar area.  I mean if the server is busy because she handles to go orders in addition to bar tables and those coming up to the bar then that is an internal problem and Red Robin should fix and address that.   Food:  Not that you could ever get an exceptional meal here, it is burgers and for the most part they execute that well.  However, the toppings sometimes are sketchy.  I have seen many pieces of brown lettuce on my burgers and salads.  Ask for your burger to be wrapped in lettuce and they give you this inedible concoction that is not wrapped properly.  If you cannot execute something that simple then don't offer it.  Fries are however great and I think their claim to fame.  Appetizers are basic and so are the desserts we almost never eat dessert here.   As a result of the service and the quality of the food I will not be patron this place anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-langhorne,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006

You have to ask for fries specifically now, and it took us about 3 times to ask until we got them, and they came after our food. The utensils and cups were all dirty. The manager was walking around asking about the service so we told her and they didn't do anything about it. Really? Why even ask? The burger tastes like mcdonalds $1 menu, and that's pathetic because it's $11. People near us that came after us got the same exact food and same amount of people had their food come out way before us.

For a burger place one would assume burgers would be fresh.  But that is definitely not the case here.  Burgers were definitely frozen.   And I know this because I've been working in a restaurant for the last 22 years and I personally make the burgers each and every day.  Personally charging 10.99 for a frozen burger is ridiculous in my opinion.   Then there's the bottomless fries. Is it me or when you want more fries your server is no where to be found and when you do find them to order more fries it seems to take another 15 minutes.   I haven't eaten at red robin in like 5 years and now it's coming back to me why I've stayed away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-langhorne,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88

1,Jeff S.,"Bucks County, PA",569,1716,407.0,1.0,2017-06-19,"We've been coming here for almost 2 years. My kids are still superfans because of the video games and kid oriented food but this place is beginning to wear me out.  We stopped in this past weekend right at opening and arrived to a mostly empty house. We were promptly seated and as we sat down I was surprised that the restaurant was so dirty. Our table was sticky and the chairs had crumbs on them. The floor was littered with food and paper. The kids high chair was sticky and full of crumbs.  We told the waitress and she came over with some dirty wet rag and wiped the table down. Thanks. Nothing better than cleaning up a food mess with a sopping wet bacteria-fest. I have to mention she did nothing about the dirty chairs, high chair and floor nor did she explain why the place was so dirty right after opening. Didn't they clean the night before or that morning?  Then there were the bathrooms. Also problematic. The men's bathroom in particular was revolting. There was unflushed business in the toilets. The smell was an abomination. The paper towel machine was empty. My wife reported that the baby changing station in the women's bathroom was dirty. Wtf is going on here??  I'm not sure why the place was so disgusting 5 minutes after they opened but it's seriously not a good sign. The food is average to begin with. Coupled with filth, you don't have such a great model for long term success. One star for Red Robin.

Fine. 15 minutes later we were finally seated. (Plenty of empty tables...not sure why we had to wait at all). The waitress came over and made a big deal about bottomless fries as an appetizer and said we had to get them they're so good bla bla bla. So we said ok. She never brought them. We ordered drinks. We had 3 kids with us and they brought my 4 year old daughter's drink last when first rule at restaurants is to always bring the kids' stuff first. My nephew's burger was completely wrong...not what he ordered at all. I ordered my burger well done and the waitress even made a big deal about saying ""so no pink at all?"" and I said no. Well my burger came out medium rare with the sweet potato fries I ordered. I sent it back and after the rest of the table was done eating the manager finally came over with my well done burger but the wrong fries (steak fries instead of sweet potato fries). She said they were comping my meal for the inconvenience. We never received napkins and had to go behind the server station and get them ourselves. Our waitress had no idea what she was doing and was breaking dishes and glasses left and right.
