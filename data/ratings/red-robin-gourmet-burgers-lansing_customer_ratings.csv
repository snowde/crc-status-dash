30,William M.,"Royal Oak, MI",29,93,,1.0,2012-05-07,"I tell Red Robin exactly what I want on my burger for my take-out orders.  They always add items I don't want.  Last time, they added ketchup which I cannot stand the taste of and could not scrape off the bun.  I contacted Red Robin and got a snotty e-mail from   stating they wanted me to waste more of my time calling them.  I'm not calling them over a simple issue.  So far, they are refusing to credit my credit card or offer me a refund.  $10 is a little too pricey for a burger anyway. In short, Red Robin is rude and cannot even follow simple directions when preparing food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lansing?start=20,2.212,2.212,2.212,2.212,2.212
35,Leslie K.,"Northville, MI",72,213,4.0,3.0,2012-12-31,"This place was chosen by our friends who had twins the same hour as we had our twins 16 months ago. It was chosen for it's ""kid friendly"" atmosphere. I have to say it is very kid-friendly. The decor is hodgepodge, with some paintings having light up sections that seemed to keep our kids interested in staring at the walls and not flinging food. The menu includes several kid options, which was great, but our boys ended up wanting mostly the fries, and our friends' kids wanted to eat ketchup.  The food was good, a little salty, but what you would expect for the price you pay. And they were quick to bring out another order of mac & cheese when some of the kids needed a refill. They kept our drinks refilled and checked up on us frequently. I really liked the fact that nobody seemed perturbed by the fact that we were passing around babies & the babies were passing around chicken. Sometimes flinging.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lansing?start=20,2.476,2.476,2.476,2.476,2.476
23,Nick B.,"Lansing, MI",14,16,,2.0,2014-07-27,"Quick summary: Slightly above mediocre, overpriced, and over run by kids.  To start out, I'll admit I was dragged to Red Robin. I also had my concerns that we were the only table within sight that was under 65 or not accompanied by a minor. 3 birthday clap sessions broke out while we were eating.  The good: Smoke & Pepper burger was prepared to order and the upgrade to sweet potato fries was worth it. The burger was fresh and seasoned, even if a bit greasy. The server was competent, but she also had the vacant look one occasionally sees in the eyes of Chuck E Cheese employees.   The bad: 2 burgers, 1 beer, 1 softdrink and tip = $50.60. The Oberon tasted like the same barrel had been on the tap for a month. All together, not as bad as I feared, but I can think of many other places I'd prefer to spend my money.

22,J C.,"Lansing, MI",5,58,10.0,3.0,2014-12-22,"Oh red robin.  Your burgers and strawberry lemonade are awesome but the place is a little crazy as some others have pointed out. You go in, and it's always got a crowd, so that's good and bad. Expect a lot of noise and perpetuating chaos while you dine.  I will say though their food is consistent and sometimes all you want is a juicy burger and bottomless fries.  I would give it 4 stars based on that but took a star away Bc the service here is VERY hit or miss.  Good place to go with your family if you have kids.

28,Chelsea B.,"Lansing, MI",73,6,,1.0,2014-12-29,"When this restaurant first opened the service was decent, however recently the service has suffered. Server seems completely uninterested and bored. The food the same, I've had a decent burger from this restaurant but that was about five years ago. The last copy of visits, the food was never cooked to my requested temperature and presentation was lackluster. On top of that, my mom recently had a case of food poisoning from this very restaurant back in October.

Thank you Red Robin for having great chicken options. She went with the whiskey river bbq chicken sandwich. Tangy bbq sauce, moist chicken breast, and crispy onion straws. Perfect sandwich. I tried the double tavern burger. Solid burger, good taste. Noticeably smaller then the typical gourmet burger offered. Really fast friendly service, thank you Michael!

31,Min E.,"Lansing, MI",0,5,,1.0,2015-02-11,"I went last night for the first time. Server never came back to the table once we were served. I got the mushroom burger. It was overcooked and dry. No condiments at this place???? I tried to get our waiter back and was told repeatedly they would get him but he never showed up until our bill came. Oh, he came back once, to bring the order to go that I wanted at the END of the meal. I hadn't even started eating yet!! I asked him to bring me a fresh one when I paid and he said they would keep it warm then left without it. The order to go was over done, and the bun was not toasted as requested. We were never offered endless fries, and I didn't know they had them until I came here today. I wont go again, not worth the $50",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lansing?start=20,,,,,
24,Michelle L.,"Lansing, MI",1,21,,3.0,2015-02-28,"Bottomless sides!  I usually get the Red's Tavern Double with BBQ sauce and the crispy onion straws. affordably priced at $7. since sides are bottomless that is usually more that enough to fill me up. Main reason I didn't give it 4 stars  is that service seems to be better if you avoid mealtimes (roughly 6-8:30pm), our experiences have been rather dismal during those times. We're talking 30+ minute waits for food (even if we order when the server first comes), no drinks or lack of refills, appetizer arriving with/after the meal, can't find our server to pay the bill type stuff. So if you're looking for somewhere to eat between 9-11pm it's affordable and tasty. Nice place to catch up with friends since you have the option of endless sides.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lansing?start=20,,,,,
14,Tyra N.,"Midtown, Detroit, MI",166,134,145.0,3.0,2015-03-10,"A fan since the early 2000's. Quality does vary by location. The variety in style of burgers is nice. The ingredients are on par with Applebees, Chilli's etc. So no, it's not farmers market fresh but it's whole food.  They are known for their bottomless fries and freckled lemonade for a reason. They're friggin good! They make a nice cocktail too. Seasoned fries are my favorites but the sweet potato fries give other chain burger joints a run for their money. My only critique is the meat, it's not seasoned well. It's more like filler for the rest of the ingredients. Having great cheese, buns and sauces makes up for it but I can definitely make a better tasting burger at home. I do order turkey burgers or chicken sandwiches so I am reviewing those only.  I lied, my other critique are the dessert options, they're limited and mostly chocolate or dairy.  Service is fast and depends on the location but I haven't had poor service at any Red Robin. Mediocre maybe but not even in my bottom 10. If you're in the mood for great fries, great lemonade, a decent burger, especially if you don't trust a diner in a business town, have Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lansing,,,,,

The Whiskey River BBQ burger was good, but it was more well done than medium well, as I had ordered. I've also noticed that RR is stingy with their fries. The metal cup they bring them in was about half full for both of our orders.

One waitress about ran over me with a tray of food. Another one bumped in to me and didn't even say excuse me. Host initially sat us at a table that was not big enough for our family. In the bathroom one of the soap dispensers was out of soap. No hot water in the bathroom to wash your hands. Air conditioning was on full blast to the point our food got way too cold too fast.

When the fries cane out they were drenched in salt. I like salt however these were inedible.  The bartender apologized and ordered me new ones. After 15 minutes they never arrived. I then saw them sitting in the kitchen window. After another 8 minutes I mentioned something to the bartender. He apologized and brought me the salad that came with it instead. I then found a black hair in my salad. A manager came by and I mentioned something to him. He just said sorry and moved alone.  The guest next to me also had fries his were cold.

1,Bryan Y.,"Fort Wayne, IN",56,65,21.0,1.0,2017-10-12,"Unbelievable. Single diner and I come in and sit at the bar, I rarely take a table away from a server. I travel for a living and at times just like a chain restaurant to take some of the guesswork out of a meal. Having driven about 8 hours I figured it was time to make a stop. Red Robin has treated me Ok since my last bad experience quite a few years ago in WA, no fear as things have been pretty positive. BIG MISTAKE!  Please see the attached pictures. The first couple of pictures are of what I was served followed by what is represented on the corporate web site. The fries have NOT been touched, I was literally served maybe 10 fries. Thank goodness they are bottomless as it seemed the bottom had dropped out of my order. Please take careful notice of the wilted, brown, swampy lettuce that came on my gourmet burger. That too was untouched other than to lift it off of my pathetic gourmet burger.  Red Robin have you no professionalism? Red Robin have you no pride?  Your chain touts itself as a place for wonderful gourmet hamburgers and yet this is what you provide your customers.  The corporate site states, Our Leadership Their mission is clear: Make it fresh. Make it fun. Make it memorable. And above all, make 'em smile.  Fresh, no not really, look at the swamp grass passed off to me as lettuce. Fun? The fun has been writing this review.  Memorable? You have made it memorable for all the wrong reasons. There is no smile on this paying customer. See you later Red Robin. There are enough choices out there that a person would think a business as large and far reaching as yours would take the time to take care of customers with a decent product.
