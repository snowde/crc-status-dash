We placed our drink order, a pepsi and an ""Adult Shake,"" with Jameson, Guinness, and chocolate ice cream, that was effing fantastic, sucked it down in 5 minutes! A little bit longer of a wait for Kristen, our server, to come back to the table to order food, I guess she was busy with her other two tables. I feel like we must have been her last one because she was always disappearing, probably to do side work or roll silverware.  After a long but not too long of a wait to place our order of 2 burgers and fries, we waited about 35 minutes for our burgers with maybe a dozen other guests in the restaurant. She dropped of our food and never came back. I had to shout to get her attention for the water I asked for at the beginning of our meal, and my husband had to  call for her attention as well to get more ""unlimited fries."" She must have only heard him say ""me"" instead of ""we,"" because she only brought fries for him. I didn't even bother saying anything except, ""Can we get the check and a box.""

If you like a good burger there are so many better choices than Red Robin. The focus at RR is on toppings. A good burger needs few toppings. But Red Robin is all about the toppings, to the neglect of the actual ""burger"". The beef patties on RR's ""Gourmet Burgers"" are a slap in the face to great burgers everywhere. The patties are dense, chewy, and flavorless. If you like to eat toppings, by all means, go to RR, order a burger and enjoy.

There's nothing particularly interesting for kids to do or see here (two for-pay coin op video games, big whoop), and the children's menu is decent but really standard in terms of selections. The burgers are good, as you might expect, but value for price I didn't find them that remarkable. The ballyhooed bottomless fries come with a catch: they give you very few at first, you then have to ask for a refill, and they get progressively harder to refill.

43,S B.,"Albany, NY",89,72,13.0,2.0,2015-06-10,"We had to try the burgers since RR claims to be gourmet. Gourmet they are not. Let's talk about the meat patties, the essence of a great burger.  First, the rarest they will cook a burger is Medium. But when you order Medium it's always served fully cooked with no pink but with grisly mystery bits of who knows what in the meat and the patties are super dry and tasteless.  The are not fresh tasting despite the fact that they claim their meat is never frozen. The meat is poor quality and it scares me that they refuse to serve their burgers with even a tinge of pink. These are over priced poor quality burgers. What's funny is that they offer a black and blue burger. Traditionally black and blue means meat flash sealed/blackened on the outside with and almost raw interior. Their interpretation of a black and blue is a well done burger seasoned with Cajun spices and topped with blue cheese.  So, if you like decent burger patties cooked to your liking without being well done or with bits of gristle, don't consider this a destination burger spot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-latham?start=40,2.84,2.84,2.84,2.2800000000000002,2.84

11,Bill Z.,"Hyde Park, NY",593,1477,270.0,2.0,2015-12-05,"Red Robin is in general my ""entry level"" for burger restaurants, particularly when my mom is with me. She prefers turkey burgers, which they do well. She also has some dietary restrictions, which they can accommodate. I'm not keen on their fries, but I'm glad they now let you substitute things like salad or broccoli or cole slaw. I also like their sweet potato fries better then their regular fries; I just wish you got more with your order. Mom's turkey burger was fine. My cheeseburger came out cooked to order, but the beef did not have a particularly strong flavor. The majority of the flavor was the smoky sauce on the bottom bun. It was good, but I'd rather have the taste of the burger. The little monitor machines they have at the tables here are a 2-edged sword. I do like being able to pay by credit card on them.  But what I don't like is that they make the wait staff less proactive, and that was certainly the case here. If you want refills on drinks or your unlimited sides, you have to use the device to request them. It's like the staff is trained not to offer them - they wait for you - and as a result they don't check on you quite as often, unless it's to see if you're done with your meal.  Our bill was also incorrect. I ordered a substitute side for my meal as well as an extra side, and I was charged for both. Our waiter did correct that when notified. Quite frankly, for the price I paid here, I'd rather spend slightly more money and get roughly the equivalent down the street at Burger 21.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-latham,2.4,2.4,2.4,2.6000000000000005,2.4

Her salad was not appealing to the eye at all, burnt garlic bread, etc. now... it was a Sunday, but that shouldn't matter. 1- we were sat immediately. After almost 20 min, a girl came by to see if we were greeted. No. We had no waters, etc. she went to the girl who was our waitress, and after another 20 min, she finally came by. We received our small app in like 20 minutes. So it's been an hour, and we basically just got water, coke, and fried zukini. We than waited almost 50 min for a salad and a medium burger. 2 hours+. I've had 4 course fine dining meals that took less time. Horrible. Manager never came and spoke to us. Really bad 1st impression and I wouldn't go back",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-latham,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92

0,David C.,"Castleton-on-Hudson, NY",26,1,,4.0,2017-07-13,I had a bacon cheeseburger it was pretty good. My waitress was nice to me and their honey mustard is good which is important to me. Boneless wings were also good and the bottomless fries are a great deal.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-latham,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004

Burgers were excellent, but not a fan of their fries.
