Just because the bottle doesn't say ""hey, there is gluten in this"" doesn't mean it won't make me unbelievably sick for a week.

Our waitress apologized & quickly remedied the problem.  No harm done... until we got the check.  That's when I realized that they had forgotten to bring out appetizers that we had ordered.  They didn't forget to charge us, though.  I pointed this out to our waitress, who was mortified that she was going to have to tell her manager that our order had been messed up a third time.  We fixed the problem by getting it to go & she brought it out in a hurry.   In the end, everything came out fast and good.  I'd be more upset except that even with having to have our meals redone, they still came out fast.  I'll pretend that I caught them on two bad nights in a row.  I'll still go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-layton?start=40,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0840000000000005,3.0000000000000004

The bacon on the burger taste the same as McDonald's,  if you like that great, I took a bite and spit it back out on my plate. Didn't look to cool but I just was not ready for fast food taste at a sit down burger joint.  Root beer floats for the kids are bottomless and tasty. Ice tea was OK and refills came in a timely manner. Ranch dip was great. The saving grace for messing the bacon up and going with paper thin fast food leftovers was, they have a tier 2 menu, $15 burgers but hey they found some pepper bacon that resembled real food. I will go to the next level next time and order an elite burger, that really looked good. 3 stars is accurate for Red Robin, fun decor, noisy, bottomless drinks and fries, nice staff, soggy fries and paper thin bacon for third world countries bad restaurants.  Can't mess up the bacon in this country.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-layton?start=20,3.12,3.12,3.12,2.9880000000000004,3.1200000000000006

Sat in the bar area and watched as the waiters/waitresses contaminated just about everything they touched with their bare hands. The bar tender would make the drinks and use bare hands to put strawberries into the freckled lemonade, the waiters/waitresses would touch their face/hair then touch the lime/lemons to put in the drinks. One waiter was even scratching his hairy psoriasis arms and dug his hand into the container with the limes and placed it in the drink. Also another one would pour the chocolate shavings into her hand and eat a few then dump the rest on top on the milkshake. Another waitress was taking out a spoon that was in a milkshake and licked it.  WHO DOES THAT? Completely unprofessional. They also place drink trays leaning against the front of the area where the bar tender is, and they fell multiple times onto the dirty ground and would just pick them up and put them right back. Completely disgusted! I couldn't even finish my burger. They serve drinks on those contaminated trays to customers, the customers pick up whatever bacteria was on the floor by handling the cup their drink is in and then touch their burger.
