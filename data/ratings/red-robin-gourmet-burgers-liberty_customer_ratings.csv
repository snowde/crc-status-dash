20,Jack B.,,2,10,,3.0,2012-10-05,"A couple of nights ago my dad and I paid a visit to the Red Robin in Liberty, MO.  This was my first visit to this location since the disappointing take-out last month.  Tonight, Dad and I dined in.  This time the experience was a vast improvement over the previous one. Overall, it was a positive experience.  A couple of things though did miss the mark and, if this were a greasy spoon dive, I would have taken it in stride.  However, this restaurant has a ""#1 Zagat Ranked"" sign on the door so I expected more when dining here. One of the staff cheerfully greeted us at the door and the hostess promptly seated us.  There was no silverware or napkins on the table and the hostess didn't seem to notice so either she wasn't trained to notice, she didn't think it was her job to notice or, at this restaurant, it actually isn't her job to notice. The server was prompt too.  After he welcomed us, I asked him for a couple of set-ups while we looked over the menu since he didn't seem to notice either or care.   The server came back in a few minutes and told us that the silverware was just coming out of the dishwasher and it would be a couple of more minutes for the set-ups.  The server then brought us a basket of fries with some type of sauce.  We weren't familiar with the sauce and it wasn't exactly to our liking so I tried to add some ketchup to it but the ketchup bottle was almost empty; empty to the point where it sputtered and spit all over when I tried to squeeze some ketchup out.   Fries are a big part of the menu at a burger restaurant.  I would expect that it would be routine to check the ketchup bottle when a table is bussed.  I guess that was missed in the training. The server stopped by again to tell us that the set-ups were still not ready and I asked for a new bottle of ketchup.  The server brought us our burgers and fries and returned a minute later holding up a couple of table knives indicating that that was all that was ready.  I had to tell him that all we really needed was some napkins since we were just having burgers and fries.  He promptly brought the napkins to the table. The restaurant was only about half full and the bar area was practically empty and the dishwasher couldn't keep up?  In addition, we were eating finger food this time.  I wonder if restaurant had been busier or we had ordered something that actually required silverware to eat, would we have had to let our food set while we waited for silverware or, would they have just stopped serving such food until the dishwasher caught up? As to the food, my dad had the Bacon Cheeseburger and I had the Royal Red Robin Burger.  Both burgers and the fries were very good.  It was the first burger and fries in our hunt for a good burger joint that my dad has said that he really liked.  While I enjoyed them as well, I have noticed that every time that I have eaten Red Robin burgers I run out of burger before I run out of bun.  Personally, I would like to have an equal burger to bun ratio. One of the mangers did stop by to check on us when we were almost done with the meal (we didn't see the server again until it was time for the check).  I didn't bring up the earlier oversights to him since there was nothing he could do for us at that point.  Unfortunately, his demeanor made his visit seem obligatory rather than genuine. As I said at the beginning, overall it was a positive experience.  I do think there are still some training issues and, maybe, some management commitment issues at this Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-liberty?start=40,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003

51,Andrea C.,"Gower, MO",1,16,,4.0,2013-05-26,I like Red Robin. Yes it can be noisy with kids but you have to kind of expect that from someplace who specializes in burgers and fries. Definately not McDonald's.  We have eaten there several times at the Liberty Mo and Olathe Ks locations. We have been there when it was busy and slow and have always gotten good service. A manager has always checked on us at least once during our visits and I have seen a manager taking food to tables during really busy times. I like the burgers and think they are a good size and the fries have always been plentiful and hot.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-liberty?start=20,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004

It arrived on a plate ( baskets aren't being used any longer at the robin ). There were 2 small chicken strips, 6 small shrimp (no pun intended), fries, and coleslaw. When I questioned the chicken and shrimp portions, I was told I could have unlimited fries and slaw!  Really?  My husband ordered the Ensenada Chicken Platter and was also disappointed by the smaller portion.

28,Joy B.,"Liberty, MO",1,1,,3.0,2013-08-31,We had dinner there this past week. Do not like the new plates or the fact that they don't put the wrappers on the burgers. Very messy to eat. No place on plate to put ketchup. Husband ordered burger with fried egg and yolk was not cooked. Had to send it back. We were told that they don't break the yolk anymore! Guess that's ok if you like it raw. Love going there but not sure we will be going back. I usually don't mind change but in this case not so sure it was a good idea.  On the upside Hostess and waitress were very nice.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-liberty?start=40,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003
37,Amy A.,"Kansas City, MO",1,12,3.0,2.0,2013-11-06,"Heard good things about Red Robin, so we gave it a try. It is a fun atmosphere! Balloons, kids, music, etc... I think the burgers are good, but a bit overpriced for well, a burger. First time... our waiter almost completely ignored us. We eventually got our order placed, and once our food came, we never saw him again. I literally had to flag someone else down to get our ticket. Forget about drink refills.  Second time... The waiter was very nice. But, again issues with the service. I ordered iced tea to drink, and there was no sweetener on any tables... Anywhere. I guess you have to ask for it. When our food came (literally the next time I saw the waiter!) I asked for some, and he did deliver. But I wish I had been able to enjoy my iced tea before my meal.  In conclusion, I think they must have some training issues, particularly with the wait staff. They are nice, but really need to get it together. So....

I was sat next to the kitchen area, and they had a radio on blaring a different kind of music. Kids everywhere screaming and yelling. The tv's were turned up.

19,Carrie C.,"Kansas City, MO",104,148,52.0,2.0,2014-08-10,"Red Robin puts up a powerful front. Their commercials catch your eye and the idea of bottomless fries beckon you to their doors but... my trip to Red Robin is not at all something I wish to repeat.  No, no, no, there wasn't a bug in my food, the waiter didn't give us a horrible attitude, and I didn't get sick. But truth be told, I'd rather have something to talk about rather than have nothing to talk about. And that's just the thing. Nothing here was memorable, and it was completely lacking in every possible way.  Now I'll be fair, my turkey club was good. If I were to ever come again (which, wouldn't be my choice, I'll admit) I would probably order it. The sandwich itself is probably the only thing that let me give the place 2 stars. The fries are pretty basic steak style fries, they just aren't the kind that keep me craving more - and on this visit, they came out a little cold. Although, I think that might just be because the restaurant itself was freezing.  Our waiter seemed distracted and only stopped by once after our initial order. It's not that he was unpleasant - he was nice when he stopped by, however he was inattentive to any refills (we didn't get a single one nor did he even ask), and forgot to place a milkshake order one of us had made. What disappoints me is that the restaurant wasn't really all that busy. Maybe half of the tables were filled? And they had plenty of waitstaff around, so it's lost on me as to why he was having trouble with our table. At the end of our meal, we had to pull another waiter to the side to get our tabs.  I'm actually really disappointed in Red Robin. If anyone knows me, I hate writing negative reviews. On the outside, it sounds like a neat place for a good dinner, and many of their burgers and sandwiches sound good. But unfortunately, I very seriously doubt that I'll be back to try any more of them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-liberty,3.36,3.36,3.36,2.7920000000000007,3.3600000000000003

They have been very understanding and helpful when it comes to their Gluten Free options for some of my family members.  My only complaint is how overwhelming it can be when it's packed with people, it's very loud when it's crowded but it's supposed to be a fun, family-welcoming establishment so that isn't something that can be helped.

He didn't throw anybody under the bus or anything, just told the truth. So we settled in to wait again and were rewarded in a few minutes with two of the best burgers we have had in a long time.    Mine was the tavern burger, a classic with a great fresh poppy seed bun. The Chess Player got some gourmet thing that was wonderful and neither of us thought we could eat them because Colton brought us those darn fries while we waited and they just jumped into our mouths.

When we finally ordered our drinks, they were out of lemonade and milk for the kids. It was 1 PM, and they weren't that busy. Ok, so we moved past that, but then... It took probably 40 minutes after ordering our food before it arrived. We were never asked if we wanted bottomless fries while we waited or sorry that we were waiting so long. Nope. Just got to sit and wonder because our waiter was MIA. So once our food FINALLY came out, one person was missing an item they ordered and was told they were out of that item (no offer for replacement), 2 of the meals had the wrong sides, an ice cream dish was so freezer burnt it was inedible, and one burger had to be sent back because the meat was not cooked. And by not cooked, I mean it was so bloody and red in the middle I thought it was going to start mooing at me. It was supposed to be well done.

If I'm paying $11 per burger, you could probably treat me to a drink that costs you less than a quarter in a bar area that was empty...)  Anyways, got home and my burger that was ordered medium well had dripped blood into the to go box. : ( The DH's burger was prepared as ordered. Nothing outstanding.  Our dine in experience was early on Sunday evening, with lots of open seats in the dining room. It took us a few minutes to get our order placed as one server seemed to be attending to almost a fourth of the tables.  We asked for a basket of fries to tide us over during the wait for our meals and after a gentle ask, we received them about 15 minutes later.  Still no food. Should have been a clue that one table had asked to get a new server and another table that was comped their entire meal because of slow times from the kitchen.   All in all, it took us over an hour to have dinner, which when fine dining would be acceptable.  When eating dinner with little kids, that's a recipe for disaster. Our server was friendly and professional, just seemed to be weighed down by inefficient kitchen staff. On a happy note, my bonzai burger was delicious and I learned that they serve sweet potato fries as an alternative to the regular steak fries for a little variety.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-liberty,3.2,3.2,3.2,,3.2000000000000006
34,Sarah M.,"Manhattan, KS",4,15,6.0,3.0,2015-07-31,"My visit started off pretty well but nothing special. Our food was taking a while so the waiter brought us some yummy fries and our choice of dipping sauces to hold us over. Our food was brought out shortly after we finished our fries. I asked for the ghost pepper sauce for my ghost tavern jalapeño burger (something like that) to be on the side, but it was not in my basket.  It took the waiter probably ten minutes or so to check back in and notice the sauce was missing, but I do have to acknowledge the fact that the place was PACKED. I never saw the waiter stand around. He was always helping someone, but it did affect the service at my table so it was still a bit disappointing.  My burger was pretty good, but there were only four small fresh jalapeños and two dime-sized fried jalapeños total. That's not much to cover the burger. The ghostpepper sauce did have a nice salsa-base and spicy kick which made up for some of the disappointment with the burger.  Overall, my experience was pretty average, and I almost chose to rate four stars. I think maybe extra staff would help with the problems that come with a busy restaurant-the food looking like it was rushed to be made, the slow check-ins, less drink refills, and less delicious bottomless fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-liberty?start=20,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006
40,Diana M.,"Hartford, KS",14,15,3.0,5.0,2015-09-21,"We had a great time out with our friends and our families. We were found two tables to seat our group of 13 beside each other. They even found the table rather quickly even though they were packed for a Saturday night. Our waiter, Austin, was amazing and we were never left with empty drinks or without a plate of bottomless fries! Many of the kids chose the happy face pizza or the cheeseburger from the kids menu. You know it is good when 8 children eat all of it plus a lot of the steak fries as well. All of the adults ordered different types of cheeseburgers which were cooked and seasoned to perfection. In fact I am the only one who had to take half home after indulging in their campfire sauce and fries! We can't wait to go back again as this was the best food and service we have had in a long time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-liberty?start=20,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006

32,Janet W.,"Liberty, MO",0,29,2.0,5.0,2016-01-03,"Love Red Robin!!!  Being vegetarian, love the selection of toppings and even choice of veggie burger patty. Being an adult, kudos to Red Robin for having an over 21 bar area!!  Eating out these days is a treat and enjoying a cocktail and dinner minus screaming from two feet away is a pleasure. As well, restaurant side is great for families, balloons and all. The restaurant looks clean and I've had great service every time. I find the prices to be not much higher than fast food burgers and better selection by far. The only change I could possibly suggest would be to put that usually empty patio to good use by making it a smoking patio with a happy hour drink menu. But your adult bar area is progressive and will keep me returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-liberty?start=20,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006

They took an additional 20 minutes to get it back while our drinks were not filled the whole time.

Mmm I have to remember to come back to red robin more. Croissant sandwiches are yummy also if you've never had one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-liberty,3.24,3.24,3.24,,3.2400000000000007

No less than 7 tables surrounded us, covered in half eaten food and used plates. Our server - whose name escapes me - was too concerned with chatting up her friends to actually manage her tables. Again I emphasize, what do we expect - but why do ""fast casual"" restaurants such as this bother to ask how you'd like your burger cooked?! We all know you're getting a well done hockey puck; don't raise my expectations, only to under-deliver.

Of course we couldn't get enough of the fries. Our server on this particular day was not the best, but I won't let that affect this review because overall service was great. One thing that i did absolutely love about their service is they clearly worked as a team. When our fries ran out, other servers even the manager would jump in and  re load us. Another server even brought our food out. Now to the food. The kids ""pizza"" was a cut up bun with sauce and cheese. Total waste of money. Stick with burger or chicken fingers. My husbands burger was pretty tasty as well but the  bacon was paper thin. Almost like the pre cooked stuff you get at the store. I had the Siracha burger with and upgraded to garlic fries. It was so good! I paid a $1 upgrade for the fries and the portion was extremely small. I'm assuming this is because of bottomless fries. Lastly, we spent $60 for 2 adults and 3 kids.
