Our server dropped the food off and NEVER came back to check on us!**(when we first sat down the salt and pepper shakers were greasy, grimey and gross!.. I asked him to wipe them off... Then I could Not get a refill for my diet coke for anything.. He wouldn't even look over at us !!! Finally this other waitress came near enough to us that's we just asked her to get our waiters attention!! Soooo she then instead asked us what we needed..we said we just wanted drink refills! She offered to bring them for us!!!! She then never came back until finally she came again and said ""oh what are you drinking?? "" We told her a soda and a water... This time she really never came back and neither did our assigned waiter!! Sooo finally we asked some random staff for a manager to come over to us,& the managers name was. ""Megan""...she was kind,apologetic and everything nice!!! At that point just actually getting our drinks before we ""keeled over"" from thirst was all we wanted! Megan made sure we got our drinks and she comp'd our meal(which that was NOT what we were after .. We just wanted her to know that the waiter dropped out food off and never came back!!!)..she was so nice and that Made us feel much better just to know someone actually cared!!  Thank You!  Megan!!  Soooo.....after much re-consideration and after the way we were treated so great by the manager, ""Megan""...we decided that we will go back and give it another try!

20,Ann W.,"Northville, MI",63,299,984.0,3.0,2014-02-12,"Red Robin is a high-energy, casual restaurant popular with families. On any typical evening, you may see groups celebrating birthdays, watching sports, or enjoying a good meal in a fun environment.   While there are over a dozen different burgers on the menu, the Banzai burger is my go-to choice. With grilled pineapple slices and sweet Teriyaki sauce, the medium rare burger was juicy and delicious. To minimize calories, I enjoyed the burger wrapped in lettuce leaves, instead of the sesame seed bun, and without the mayo. This burger tends to be very messy so I tend to order it with half the sauce, enough for flavor without compromising the overall taste of the burger. Burgers come with bottomless steak fries but can be substituted with other items, such as salad (at no extra cost), sweet potato fries ($1), or soup ($2). The sweet potato fries are definitely worth the extra price/calories. One of the main attractions is the vast beverage menu. The freckled lemonade, lemonade with sweetened strawberries, is always a tempting treat. I also love the root beer float, made with soft serve, and the milk shake. I am craving them as I write this. Too bad it is close to midnight or I would be out the door. Sign up for their loyalty program and enjoy freebies, such as a free burger on your birthday and every tenth burger free. Surprise treats are also communicated throughout the year - all great reasons for joining. Recent examples include: - Free small order of onion rings, with $10 minimum purchase - 50% off burger, with $10 minimum purchase - Free gingerbread shake, with $10 minimum purchase Service is friendly and prompt and should be a role model for other restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-livonia?start=20,2.572,2.572,2.572,2.572,2.5720000000000005

You really don't taste the burger.   Fries were good especially with dipping sauce but that's not to be the main draw. Hubs enjoyed the tortilla soup and also felt meh about the royal burger. The burger patties are lacking something... Son's chicken strips were quite yummy and seem to be an improvement over last time. Hostess was friendly.

18,Cristina B.,"Chesterfield, MI",260,137,65.0,1.0,2015-04-04,"Red Robin Gourmet Burgers ..... I can guarantee you there was nothing ""gourmet"" about my experience today. From start to finish it was completely dissatisfying. My guy and I dined here after a movie at Pheonix Theatres across the street. After having poor service there (we will not get into it!) we were both hungry and looking forward to a good meal. He decided on Red Robin because it was so conveniently located. We were seated promptly at a booth and our waitress took out drink order right away. Always a good sign, right? She then came back every minute (or less!) until we got our dinner order ready. We both don't normally dine at Red Robin, much less are familiar with their menu. Their name said ""gourmet burgers"" so we both took that as a good sign and ordered, well, burgers. We also ordered an appetizer of chili cheese fries to split.  I barely had a chance to open my straw from it's wrapper before our appetizer was on our table. To be honest, it was the saddest looking concoction of chili cheese fries ever. Half of the cheese was melted, half of it wasn't. Fries itself were not fully cooked and the meat .... let's just say I'm not feeling so great since.  Within 30 seconds of our appetizer being presented to us our dinners were also served as well. My biggest pet peeve is when your meal comes out right after getting the appetizer. If I'm ordering an appetizer, I expect to enjoy a bit of it before enjoying the meal that I ordered.  If only you could have seen the look on my face after eyeing my cheeseburger. It was not love at first sight, let me tell you. A Big Mac from McDonald's looked more appealing than whatever I was served. I wasn't aware you could screw up a burger so badly. The sesame bun was pale, not toasted, and already falling apart on the plate. The well done meat patty I asked for? Was definitely pink instead, in addition to cut in half. The half of burger patty fell out of the bun the second I picked it up! The bottomless fries with my burger? I found a handful that were still frozen. My man had similar issues with his meal. How about instead of rushing out people's food, you make sure it's fully cooked instead. Just a suggestion.  The whole situation made us both uncomfortable and made it seem like our service wasn't welcome. The place itself was fairly slow, yet we were somehow getting rushed all throughout our experience. Getting our entire meal after only being in the restaurant for maybe 10 minutes? No thank you. Our waitress (and others on the staff) were too busy talking to friends at other tables to even notice we were unhappy.  I will not be returning to this establishment anytime soon. If you want a cheaply made burger at a high cost, I suggest coming here. If not, McDonald's or Burger King make burgers better than the ones served here. Better yet, look elsewhere for a better dining experience. You be the judge.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-livonia,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.6280000000000006,3.2800000000000002
35,Don K.,"Westland, MI",23,177,47.0,1.0,2015-09-04,"We were celebrating a daughters 18th birthday with family tonight Friday 9-4-15. This place was rather busy but I don't believe the staff had much direction. Cocktails took too long to arrive. Empty glasses were not removed when serving fresh beverages. We ordered an appetizer which was rather cool, tower of onion rings, so they were probably in window too long. It took forever to get our soups which were served luke warm at best. Unfortunately we also were served our entrees at the exact same time from the other end of the table. Hmmmm what do I choose to eat hot and what to eat cold??  I chose the soup which was cold anyway. The prime rib dip was my entree of choice. The girl bringing the food wanted me to reach over three people to retrieve my dinner but I kept my hands in my lap. So she brought the plate down and reach between me and another and managed to spill the sandwich au jus on my lap before reaching the table.  At no point was an attempt made to clear appetizer plates or glassware and we are being served the cake we brought cluttered now with our dinner plates and everything from earlier. Eventually a few plates were removed but first we had stacked them to make room for ourselves and then suggested that our ""server"" do some cleaning.  We sat in back by the bar which is fine for our group of 6 but I never saw a manager, I wasn't given a chance to ask for a redo on any part of my cold dry meal. As I had been at the Westland location just last week with a member of tonight's party the only thing my guest could say was I'm sorry. Your meal looks old and dry.

The food is getting smaller and smaller! I like the seafood scatter. It used to be very filling...not so much any more! I had a burger, fries, & a side salad today, wife had the same thing. It was good, burger prepared as requested, the fries a little extra crispy like we wanted, salad fresh, and our waitress trainee did a great job! She actually let us finish our food BEFORE bringing the check! This is unusual for Red Robin! I once had the check when I was only 1/2 finished with my food...literally! ""No rush, I'll take that up when you're ready""... I ordered another beer just to screw them up. They used to have a ""No kids allowed zone"" by the bar. I LOVED this. There should be a spot like this in every restaurant. Not that I don't like kids...I do, a lot!.. but sometimes when you're wound up, on edge, and just want to relax with a cold one and a burger and take a nice long exhale...a screaming little darling behind your head doesn't help!

15,Mel T.,"Canton, MI",0,25,,4.0,2016-07-18,"After many service problems at the Westland Red Robin, we started coming here instead. We've only dined in a couple of times, and the service seemed just fine. No real attitudes (although the hosts always seem a little distracted with talking among themselves or with other employees, and sometimes they seem a little tired and fed up). Not yet, anyway. Girl on the phone doesn't sound as irritated as the one in Westland sometimes did, although I do get a sense that they want the call over with as soon as heavenly possible, even when they aren't remotely busy. The few times that we did sit down inside here, however, our service wasn't nearly as frustrating as it was in Westland. With that said... we almost never sit inside the restaurant. We order take-out meals, check it before we leave, then eat it at home. And the food itself always rocks. That's all I care about if I'm eating it at home. We do have to take a longer trip to get here than we did to get to Westland, but since the percentage of ""wrong orders"" has been very, very low here so far, we're willing to drive farther to get it. We still order the same food we always do. The burgers come out just how we ask for them. There's never been an issue with them, and we've purchased food from here about fifteen times or so, possibly more. There has rarely, if ever, been an issue with our food being wrong or cooked incorrectly. Even if the service is poor, we're not there to deal with it. Never received a wrong order yet. Sometimes they don't listen when I say ""I want a side of ranch"" on the phone and I have to ask for it when I get there, a second time. But they hand it over immediately when I ask inside the establishment. As long as I get it, I'm good. I've eaten several signature Red Robin burgers of all kinds, and I've never had one that was bad. Although I wouldn't go so far as to call them ""gourmet"". They do taste great. But not that great. I will mark the day I actually do ever eat a ""gourmet burger,"" but in my life, it hasn't really happened yet. Most burgers have similar tastes to them, and unless you can toss the meat in your own homemade spice-sauce blend before grilling, and create your own special mayonnaise spread from scratch, and have the freshest vegetables imaginable and a shelf full of the best seasonings, a cheeseburger isn't really a ""gourmet"" meal. But let's be honest. If you wanted gourmet, you'd go to Fiamma Cafe, not a burger restaurant. That doesn't mean the meal shouldn't be cooked to the utmost perfection that you can make it, but when it comes to gourmet food, I have tastes other than classic American food. When I do want classic American food... this isn't a bad first choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-livonia,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88

Red Robin is just your average chain restaurant - don't expect to be blown away.  We will continue to keep dining here as it's a good option if you're craving a decent burger. My one complaint would be the fries - although bottomless, if you don't season them they are still sub-par.   I received 2 baskets of fries both were without seasoning.   I feel this could be quickly fixed.

Unfortunately this chain is going down hill. Maybe the free refills on sides are running them into the ground.  Today the kitchen timing was way off. We waited 30min (at least) for our food and it was not hot, just luke warm. They slathered my ragin cajun with mayo, which I had asked them to leave off. I asked for ""lots of pickles on the side"" and I received a sloppy ramekin with 3 pickle chips. I played the game and asked for another side of pickles, three more tiny slices came out. I only had the heart to ask for one more additional pickle ration. The server was aware of our disappointment but made no offers to rectify mistakes. There were no managers on the floor. The place was busy, but there was no wait. Quality control was nonexistent. If there weren't 5 of us trying to have a nice lunch before heading to a family activity, I would have sent a couple things back. The check ended up being almost $100, not worth it today.
