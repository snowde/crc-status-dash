94,Beth B.,"Englewood, CO",0,1,,1.0,2012-05-12,"We usually love going to Red Robin, as it's a great place to grab a quick burger and is perfect to go with kids.  However, tonight was the worst service we've ever had!  We wanted to go to the nearby PF Chang's, but the wait was 3 hours at 5:30!  So, we headed to this Red Robin.  We could tell from the beginning that our waitress was going to be lazy, and she definitely was.  She took our order and all was good, but she was not the one to bring out our food.  It was some other guy, who asked if we needed anything else.  My father-in-law asked for a drink refill, which was never refilled, until 15 minutes later when our actual waitress came over to check on us (and give us the check).  I got the mushroom burger, which is supposed to have a parmesan spread on it, but my burger was free of any sort of spread, so it was kind of dry.  However, I didn't feel like waiting for a new burger and no one was visible to ask.  I noticed that they give you about half the normal amount of fries now, which are supposed to be bottomless.  No one asked us if anyone wanted more fries.  I drank all my tea and could have used a refill, but our waitress never came back.  Then, I went to change my baby's diaper and in the handicap stall, where the changing table is, there was no hook on the back of the door to hang my diaper bag, which was very inconvenient.  Not to mention no one bothered to clean up the bathrooms before the dinner rush, so both trashcans were overflowing paper towels onto the floor, and the counters were very wet.  Additionally, the restrooms are placed horribly.  In order to avoid walking through the servers' work station, you have to walk around the whole perimeter of the restaurant and wind your way through the tables, where there really isn't much clearance between chairs if people are sitting in them.  Then, to top off the night, we had promised our 2 year old a balloon, if she behaved herself.  She did, so on our way out, we asked for a balloon.  The high school hostess said someone was filling balloons right now and it'd be about ten minutes, if we wanted to wait!  Yeah, right!  I felt like on a Saturday night at a restaurant that's filled with children, there should be a bunch of balloons, ready to hand out.  Overall, I was just really disappointed with the service at this Red Robin!  We will be avoiding this location next time we go shopping at Park Meadows.  No wonder there was no wait for a table!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lone-tree?start=80,2.34,2.34,2.34,2.34,2.34

The price for lunch + tip was $17.  I didn't get a great value for $17, which is why I don't dine at Red Robin very often.  But, a 3-star review is too harsh and there's no chance for a 5-star.  So this is a low 4-star review in my books.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lone-tree?start=40,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997

Similary to Correy H., I also have been disappointed that most of the Red Robins seem to have adopted the ""no fries before your meal"" policy (unless you pay extra).  Although I understand the logic (they are trying to sell more apps, and reduce the amount of uneaten fries), this seems like irritatingly needless penny pinching.  I am already paying over $10 for a burger and ""bottomless"" (supposedly) fries, add $3 for a soda, and we are easily into $16 (with tax and tip) land.  This assumes you did not order an appetizer, beer, milkshake, etc.  I very much prefer eating my fries piping hot as part of the communal experience before the burger arrives.  Eating my 7 (yes, I counted) cold fries after I have consumed my burger is significantly less satisfying.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lone-tree?start=60,2.8,2.8,2.8,2.316,2.8

The service can range from excellent to so-so. We recently went there again and are wondering why they changed up the décor.  It is dark and depressing with lots of beer bottles hanging from the ceililng  . . . how do they clean those? Well actually some are dusty and there are tables with people eating right under them in the bar area. We had no complaints about the food. However our waiter got my order mixed up and I had to wait quite awhile for a new plate. We do love the burgers and sweet potato fries. Also the Cobb salad is very good.

When we finally ordered they completely messed up my husbands meal. He asked for cajun clucks and fries - they brought a chicken sandwich... how they mess that up no clue.This was even after he clearly stated that it was the chicken fingers tossed in buffalo sauce. THEN the manager came over to clarify what he wanted. After about 8 minutes they brought him the right meal BUT the chicken was completely raw inside! Disgusting!!

I hadn't been to a Red Robin in years, but I love a good burger, so I was looking forward to it. However, it seems the food has really gone downhill at Red Robin. They've (recently?) redesigned their menu and added a lot of appetizers, pared down the burgers while adding a few new ones, and kind of toned down the whole ""kiddie heaven"" vibe (fine by me!). We started with the Pretzel Bites, and well, they were quite disappointing. The bites themselves tasted like those you can buy in the freezer section and cook in your oven at home, and the beer cheese sauce? It tasted like Cheez-Whiz with some beer stirred in. Gross. I ordered the Whiskey River BBQ Burger, as I remembered liking it in the past. It was okay, but tasted like a drive thru burger. Thankfully I ordered it with a side salad because the fries I stole off of a friend's plate tasted stale and unappetizing (and they were hot, so I'm pretty sure they were ""fresh""). I only ate about 1/2 my burger and felt disappointed when I paid my bill -- $16 for a very, very mediocre burger and appetizer and a glass of water. All told, $20 with the tip for a meal that I could have gotten for $10 at a drive thru and probably would have enjoyed more. The food deserved one star, however, our server was pretty awesome. He was super friendly and attentive, plus he put up with some bad jokes from us (sorry, bud!), so he earned the extra star here. A plus for groups: this restaurant has that nifty pay-at-the-table device (I don't remember what it's called, but Chili's has something similar). You can pay when you're ready and it makes it a cinch to split the bill up, if you need to!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lone-tree?start=20,2.52,2.52,2.52,2.2800000000000002,2.52

Honestly, they should have comped the table. I guess since we had a large party it was just to much.  I cannot believe I ate here again. It was my nephews birthday, so that is why I went. His choice. This is supposedly the flag ship store. The corporate office is just across the highway. I know the execs come in every once in a while. They must wear big bright neon signs so they get the best service and food.  I tried the Ghost Pepper Burger. It was suppose to have deep fried and fresh peppers. Nope, not mine. No deep fried peppers. It was basically a dry burger with little flavor. Another sad attempt to make something really great.

76,Doug B.,"Lone Tree, CO",19,10,,1.0,2015-07-04,"Here is the text I just sent to Red Robin's HQ, though who knows whether they will take the time to take any action. I cannot recommend that you spend your good money with this location as the manager is unable to get the kitchen to prepare what's described on the menu, and if you get the server we got, they'll challenge you for asking if they brought the right product (even when it's not), they'll forget your drinks to serve a larger, later arriving party (""I got slammed"" is what they must be taught to say, instead of I'm sorry how can I fix the situation?""), the table-top checkout device will spit out a blank receipt, and a conversation with the manager will provide only a ""That shouldn't happen"" reaction without a clue of how to deal with any issues. Sad. Very sad. What was left on the RR customer service web site today: So many things wrong its hard to know where to start. Dined tonight (July 4th) at table #93 at the Lone Tree store. Service was worse than poor and the manager had no clue how to deal with it when brought to her attention at our departure. Family of 4 dining, with father paying - and this is mostly the father's (payee's) feedback based upon his meal. Incomplete meal brought to table: Red Tavern Big Turbo brought to table as plain burger with only pepperjack cheese (no special sauce, no carmelized onions). Server challenged (clueless on how to match product to food delivered) but took it back to kitchen to fix. Brought it back out - now cold - with onions thrown on top. Also not impressed that RR charges $1.80 more for a bigger burger size when all that really happens is that a double burger becomes a thin single burger. Misleading. Server then promised to being more drinks which never happened. When this was later mentioned to him he shrugged it off saying a bigger table subsequently came in and he got slammed. No offer to take any action at all, which turns out to be the same approach his manager took when we walked to see her...after our tableside checkout terminal printed us a blank receipt (no one knows how to fix that either). Overall, RR leaves a customer with a don't give a sh&t attitude, with employees so poorly trained they cannot prepare or deliver food correctly, provide good service or deal with their own ineptitude when it arrises.

Everyone at our table had already drank their entire beverage before we were able to place our order (except for the one child, whose drink was forgotten). I love the fact the offer endless fries, which helps when the kids are starving, but only if they are brought before you have been there an hour. They also offer refills on the kids mac and cheese, but again, by the time you get them the kids have lost interest.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lone-tree?start=20,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6
19,Tyler B.,"Castle Rock, CO",40,4,,2.0,2017-04-27,This chain has gone completely down hill.  It used to be our favorite place for burgers.  The food is still decent however the service is horrendous and terribly slow.  Every time we leave we swear that we won't go back.  Two months later we will get sucked back in hoping things will change and it never does. We experience this at any location we go to and there are three by our house.  I think this chain has morphed into the usual corporate abyss of bad management and no customer focus.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lone-tree,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6
8,Madison M.,"Denver, CO",106,210,256.0,2.0,2017-06-24,I have never been to red Robin before but I was really wanting a burger after seeing all of their commercials on television so I decided to stop in and give them a try one afternoon. I did not realize that their entire menu is just hamburgers and sandwiches. I was expecting more options like salads and other bar type foods but I was shocked to see that it really was just burgers and sandwiches. Since I wanted a burger I was good to go and I ordered a pretty delicious burger overall it was cooked just the way I liked it and asked for and it came out in about 10 minutes. They say that they have bottomless fries but they really don't give you much to start with they only give you a small handful of french fries. So you will definitely want to be ordering more if you are a french fry fiend like I am.  The service here is all right. A lot of it has become automated with the check out right at your table so there is less interaction with your server than there is at a number of other restaurants. This has its pros and cons but I'll let you decide if that's the kind of place you want to dine at.  Overall it was an OK experience. The booths were a little bit sticky and the table had a weird patina on the top like it had just been wiped off for 15 years instead of ever properly cleaned. It was an all right burger but I don't think that's enough to bring me back to this particular red Robin. Maybe I'll give another location to try in a few years.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lone-tree,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64

1,Chris P.,"Highlands Ranch, CO",44,68,7.0,2.0,2017-08-12,"It hurts me to give Red Robin only 2 stars as I've generally been a fan but I was not impressed.  They started out by taking way too long to get us a table.  It's a Friday night and there were plenty of open tables but the hostesses were more consumed with chit chatting with each other.  It was rather obvious they were in no rush.  Next was the rather slow service.  I'd say they need more waiters.   A good portion of their menu is various forms of hamburgers.  I'd say this seems to be their ""specialty""  The pictures on their menu have these huge juicy patties.  I ordered their Spicy Siracha burger...with some pink.  When it came it was a patty about the thickness of a McDonalds burger and was charred with no pink at all.  If burgers are your specialty, then please learn how to cook them and don't skimp on the meat.   It seems to me that Red Robin has a big name and a pretty good reputation.  Seems like they're happy enough with that and don't worry about the little things like service and quality of food.  Too bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lone-tree,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96

Decided to grab a bite at this red Robin before we caught the light rail to go see a Rockies game. We were greeted when we walked in.....well, we weren't really greeted when we walked in. The guy had his face engulfed in some menus walked us to our seats and then said someone will be with us shortly. We sat at the table for a few minutes and no waiter so we decided to move to the bar. The bartender was quick in getting us our drinks and when our appetizer came we had no silverware. I decided I would get it myself. The bartender saw me get up to go get it but also didn't say anything to me when he brought us our food. The manager also saw me going to get silverware and asked me where I was sitting. No one ever came back to check on this. I believe it all starts from management and manager was clearly aware of what was going on but chose to do nothing. My girlfriend said there's no toilet paper in the bathroom. I learned a long time ago that people go where they're invited and return where they're welcomed.

9,Heather M.,"Littleton, CO",53,80,21.0,2.0,2017-10-19,"Red Robin used to have delicious food and a fun atmosphere. Well, this is not true for this location. We were sat fairly quickly however we then had to wait about 10 minutes for some ice water. Then we asked for a glass of white zin and they say they don't have it. We order a moscotto and again they don't have it.  The drink orders took about 20 minutes and we are thankful we asked for a water! We skip the wine and now we order an appetizer of ships and salsa as we wait for the food we are ordering. After another half an hour they bring out the chips and guacamole and salsa as well as the hamburgers. We asked that the guac and chips be taken back and they comped it out( the guacamole was brown).  The manager never came to our table but did comp the salsa and give us a friend and family discount of 25%. I tipped Christina the waitress well as she tried her best, I don't feel this was her fault. It seemed to be poorly managed. The staff all seemed to be working extremely hard.

7,Kathie P.,"Englewood, CO",0,26,,2.0,2017-12-06,"I used to be a fan of Red Robin.  No longer.  First of all....the burgers have gotten really thin.  They used to be thicker, juicier, tastier.  They give less fries now too. But my biggest complaint is that they go to great pains to ask how you want your burger cooked. we both said medium to well, no pink please.  Both of our burger were very pink....hard to do when so thin. Must have barely touched the grill on each side.  This is the third time.  So not just a one time mistake.  We were hungry so we ate, and when the server came by when we were more than halfway done. We showed him, but since we ate half already we didn't send them back.  He came by at the end to tell us he told the cook. No comping the drinks, or offer of more fries or anything.  Just not as good as it used to be, and I resent being given a skinny burger when it used to be much thicker and juicier.  Better places.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lone-tree,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004

They are always so nice here and they check on you all the time to make sure you are doing alright. the server we had was so sweet and she always made sure we had a full drink and if we wanted more fries or not. they always seat you super quick to and always know what's going on in the restaurant.  I had the burger with the ghost chili sauce on it and was a little disappointed because it was not spicy at all really and if it was a ghost chili sauce then i wanted it to make me sweat, but alas it was not. It was still delicious though and this is one of my favorite chains to get a burger at. the fries here also never disappoint and are always mouthwatering good.
