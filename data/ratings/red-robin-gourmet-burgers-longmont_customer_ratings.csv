Last time we went, I had the Tavern Double, which was perfectly sized for my appetite. We sat on the patio, and although our server never showed, the bartender (wish I remember her name, she was great), took care of us. The adult milkshake was wonderful - I had something with Kahlua.

28,Maria M.,"Longmont, CO",2,14,11.0,5.0,2013-04-17,"So my family and I went to Red Robins to celebrate my daughters 8th birthday, I called in advance to see if they did anything special for the birthday girls or boys and they said yes so we went. When I arrived I had mentioned who the birthday girl was and the person who greeted us said okay and smiled as they took us to our booth. Then the waitress came quite some time later to take our drink order but because so much time had passed since we had been seated we were ready to give our order too. I had also mentioned to our waitress that we were there celebrating my daughters birthday and she smiled and said okay. 10 minutes into waiting for our order my daughter was looking around and seen other kids with balloons and asked me, "" Mommy, am I going to get a ballon?"" and I said, "" yes hunny, just wait."" Well our food was brought out and my chili fries were wrong and my daughter didn't get any at all with her burger, I was begining to get frustrated with my service. Did I need to request that somebody bring her a balloon and show a little special treatment for her B-day? I mentioned the food to the waitress but didn't feel comfortable mentioning the balloon I felt that I was being ""needy"" but that is why we went there. No later than our fries arrived so did a manager named TROY. I haven't seen such great service recovery in quite some time. He came to our table, acknowledged the mistake, joked with my kids, offered them all free Sundaes which was very nice of him (he did'nt have to do that), took the charge of my fries off my bill, sent out the Red Robins crew to sing happy birthday to my daughter and brought her a balloon and all this without complaining which was extra nice all I mentioned was that she didn't get her fries and mine were wrong. He made this experience great! I will tell everyone to go here even though it was bumpy at first, the staff genuinely cares about thier clients.

Our waitress didn't attend us until after about 7-10 mins that we've been sitting down and the hostess grabbed our drinks. Our food took at least 10-15 minutes to be ready. During this time the waitress got our refills but didn't really take care of us. Usually if you know the food is taking longer than usual you apologize, but the only thing she said was should be right out as she was going by. She didn't even stop at our table.

17,Ian M.,"Boulder, CO",0,23,,3.0,2015-02-05,"I drive here from Boulder with my girlfriend because the Red Robin Burger Works here does not offer bottomless fries. There are many servers here who are fry Nazis and are incredibly stingy with the fries. Luckily, there's one server here named Ryan that is absolutely killing it. You want more fries? He's got it. Your water is half empty? There he is refilling it. This guy literally RUNS around the restaurant getting more accomplished every 10 minutes than the other waiters probably do in an entire shift. Unfortunately this isn't the norm. If all the waiters were like Ryan, this would be a 5 star review. Maybe you should get him to train people. If nothing else, have him explain to them that giving people what they want (fries) gets them more of what they want (tips).

Drinks are reasonably prices and I like their small selection of seasonals.  If you want to be away from the clatter of the kids just sit in the middle or bar area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-longmont?start=20,,,,,

We sat for 20 minutes before we had to say something to the bus boy asking where our server was. Apparently the host sat us in an unmanned area so no server wanted to wait on us. The bus boy took our drink order and then disappeared. They have tablets on each table to distract you from the nonexistent customer service and to tack on charges to your bill from the games. A server finally came over and made a joke about how no one wanted ""dibbs"" on our table and then finally took our order. He then disappeared again and it took forever to get our bill as well.

Get organized or find the right kitchen leader that will get the place organized!

14,Forrest M.,"Longmont, CO",0,3,,1.0,2016-12-31,"I've always been a fan of Red Robin, and enjoyed their food, but my experience last night was what I would consider terrible. We arrived at the restaurant at around 8:50, got a table immediately, got drinks, etc. When we asked for fries to come out ahead of time, they came, but they were all soggy. All of the fries on any of the burgers that came out with my party were also soggy. I can understand why they served older fries, because it was late at night, but I think that when one pays $15 for a burger and more for the drinks, there should be some more quality to the situation, especially considering how much Red Robin's reputation is built on it's fries. It seems like a simple task to just cook some fresh fries. All of that wasn't a big deal to me. I've dealt with that from RR before. The thing that really bugged me was that it took a while to bring out the food, and the burger, when it came out, was medium-well to well done. I consider anything over medium burned, and I ordered my burger medium-rare. The thing was really hard and tasted charred to me for the two bites I had of it. I called the waiter over and showed him the burger, and that it was burned. He went and had another one ordered. The burger for me ended up coming out around an hour later, at 9:45. Of course the other members in my party had already eaten, and I don't want to inconvenience them, and getting food one hour after coming to the restaurant is absurd in any setting, so I had him box it. I was surprised that he didn't comp it. It's insane for food to come out that late, and anyone knows that burgers just do not taste nearly as good as leftovers. Despite all that, I come today to realize that the burger they sent home with me was also burned, despite me telling them, specifically, two times, to make it medium-rare. That's some messed up management and communication between the waiters, cooks, and supervisors. I've never been so unimpressed with a Red Robin visit. If food takes longer than 35 minutes to get to a client I'd say it should be comped because that's just too long to wait for food. If you can't prepare food to order, then you shouldn't be in the food business. If he had comped the $15 to begin with, I wouldn't care so much. But I paid $15 for food that I'm just going to toss because I didn't get it when I ordered it, nor when I asked that they fix it. I don't think I'm ever going to hit this Red Robin again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-longmont,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84
4,Kendall B.,"Longmont, CO",126,10,,2.0,2017-01-12,"Service is great depending on who's working... Ryan is by far the superstar of the restaurant. My husband and I have been going weekly for a couple years and he is the best bartender in Longmont. He is friendly, knowledgeable and extremely fast. Unfortunately it seems like every time we go now he isn't bar tending so it's not been appealing to go as often.  Also a new manager there is very entitled and when he was a server was somewhat pleasant but I wonder now if his promotion got to his head because he always used to greet us but now we just seem like an inconvenience wanting to spend money on dinner and that's a little confusing considering as a manager you should be even more interactive with your patrons. Last thing, Omission is NOT GLUTEN FREE! It says right on the bottle gluten reduced so they need to stop advertising it to their customers as gluten free. It can get people sick with gluten allergies and for such a important thing to be correct about it's disappointing that Red Robin is so careless with it. The least they can do is be accurate and not sell it as gluten free but as gluten reduced.
