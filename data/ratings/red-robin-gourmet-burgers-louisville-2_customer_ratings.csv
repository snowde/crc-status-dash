31,Tj P.,"Louisville, KY",181,275,604.0,2.0,2012-10-20,"Everyone needs a couple shots to prove their mettle, right? Well, you got yours Red Robin. For all the claims of being a gourmet burger and the Zagat sticker proclaiming your #1 status plainly stuck on the front window, your burgers are a fail in my book. Personally, I believe that someone should take a paint scraper to that sticker as I believe the last time Red Robin received that notoriety, it was in 2009. And three years later, you are far from the top. Here's the quick rundown, after my youngest son's latest music lesson, the boys were hungry for ""American"" fare and it doesn't get much more American than burgers. As Red Robin is on the route home, I decided, why not? I should've known better, as I'd been here once before, and that experience, while with more than outstanding company, was one of the few merely middling food adventures we had taken. It even spawned a very minor meme. (Is it a meme if only 2 people are aware of it?) Anyway, back to the present, the boys ordered off the Kid's Menu, chicken fingers for the youngest and a pizza for the oldest (this is the one that wanted American food?) I ordered the Tavern Double, Pub Crawl Style. In due time, the food made it to the table and while the kids' food was fine for what it was, my burger, was just not that good. The burger was overcooked and dry, the sesame seed bun had become a little stale while it likely sat up too long before the sandwich was brought out, and the steak fries, bottomless though they were, were just nothing special. And I expected far, far more. Mainly because there is far, far better out there. You simply can't claim to be THE gourmet burger when other chains are kicking your @$$ in this area on a daily basis. Five Guys, Smashburger, Home Run, hell, even Wendy's, while not throwing all the unusual toppings on the menu, just make a better burger at a better price, and I won't even make the claim that they're the best in Louisville. There's even better among the independent burger makers. But on the other hand, the service was just fine.

They got my sandwich wrong, which I was fine with them just redoing it becaue they just put the wrong kind of cheese on it. The manager came out and apologized. While apologizing, he made a few remarks about the staff goofing off and not doing their job. I know it is one thing to be sorry that the food was messed up, but he should not have insulted the staff, because it was really busy and it's understandable that small mistakes are made. I will forever love Red Robin, I just will make sure I won't stop at this one because of that general manager.

24,L W.,"Louisville, KY",11,10,6.0,1.0,2013-10-10,"I wouldn't give this place even 1 star. I used to buy their turkey burgers all the time but stopped because the last 2 i had bought was hot on the outside but a icicle in the middle. that lets me know that the burgers may be frozen. A gourmet frozen burger?  So on lunch about a month ago i decided to go again and was super disappointed. i bought a bowl of chili  and a shake. The chili is 5.49 for a small bowl and the shake is 3.39 so my order was about $10.00. The chili is amazing i must say but the bowl was only filled half way. the shake was runny and thin, it was more like a smoothie. YUK. i went on red robin's survey site and told them how i really felt about the food. the manager called and talked to me.  As a good gesture he sent me a $10.00 GC to come back. i came back today and ordered the chili chilli fries and a caramel salt shake. Again it was disgusting! hardly no chili on the fries and the fries? Well lets just say that i think they are frozen too, they have a frozen taste to them. Gourmet food? i'm sorry Red Robin, you got me phucked up... BIG TIME!

39,Kevin O.,"Louisville, KY",20,48,1.0,2.0,2014-07-23,"Red Robin isn't a bad place, but you can't slap a bunch of toppings on a mediocre burger and call it gourmet. Perhaps my tastes have changed over the years, but I once liked Red Robin. Now, I find their burgers themselves have little flavor and are at best passable for something edible. Burgers are simple and I can make better, which is saying something.  The dressings should accentuate the burger, not have to cover up for it.   The service was fine and for that I have no complaints.

We were told we could sit anywhere in the bar area except the one large open booth, but when we asked specifically for a booth (anywhere would have been fine), the hostess seated us there anyway. Our drinks came fast, everyone was friendly and efficient, our server/bartender, Vinny, was great! I ordered my usual avo-cobb-o salad and this time it was perfect!

The salad was a plain jane house salad.  Nothing special.  I only had half of one cucumber and and a couple other toppings.  It wasn't satisfying at all.  I didn't even eat half of it.  I also understand that they have endless fries, but when the initial order came out for my BF, they didn't give very many fries to begin with.  I feel like you should give a normal portion to start with and if anyone wants more, they can ask.  Just my opinion though.

While it's not gourmet, the burgers are juicy, delicious, and deeply satisfying, with what seems like an endless menu of creative burger options. While the fresh cut fries are delicious, they offer a tasty list of side-item substitutions -- my fav's: sweet potato fries, steamed broccoli, freckled fruit salad. Bottomless root beer floats?? Yes, please!!!!!!! Awesome, efficient, friendly service every time we visit, and we all leave here happy, entertained, and full = priceless. Note for families: We especially love the variety of tasty kid meal options (over 10 choices!) -- they've got it all, folks, and the prices are incredibly reasonable ($5-$6). For the kids: In addition to the traditional coloring pages and crayons you find at other restaurants, they offer some creative options to keep your children entertained and busy, so everyone can enjoy their dining experience. For example: Kids can choose from a selection of personal chalkboards for the table (some with games, like tic-tac-toe) w/mini erasers and chalk, and each table is equipped with an electronic tablet (w/ a selection of video games w/unlimited play for $1.99), and/or kids can take a red balloon home with you!

15,William S.,"Louisville, KY",0,2,,3.0,2017-02-16,"Food was ok, the kiosk was a MAJOR pain in the ASS!!!! Reduce the ""service"" part of the experience and the server still expects 20% or better? Really????  This entitlement mentality with less responsibility really SUCKS!!!! Service industry still requires SERVICE!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-louisville-2,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005
5,Samantha-Heidi O.,"Louisville, KY",26,12,4.0,3.0,2017-03-04,"Food was standard but our waiter was rude. I've only been to Red Robin once so I had a few questions and his tone and body language gave off the vibe that he thought I was dumb for asking them.  My nephew had been playing games on the table tablet the whole time we were there, but once I signed the check (tip included), our waiter took it, rung it up, and the tablet shut off. I'm not sure if the waiters manually disable the table tablets or they just shut off once they take your check - regardless, even if it's automatic, I'm not sure why he rang it up immediately when my nephew had just received the milkshake and the waiter could see my nephew was still playing on the tablet. We obviously weren't about to leave. I assume he was trying to rush us off so he had another table open... Just rude.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-louisville-2,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006
3,Dana L.,"New Albany, IN",87,487,2840.0,4.0,2017-03-31,"It's a chain people are familiar with. Decent burgers. Bottomless fries, sides, and specialty non-alcoholic drinks like floats and lemonades. Reasonably priced. Consistent. Not my go-to burger, but we've ordered there from work a lot. Orders have been correct and on time. Good prices, decent food, consistency, and reliability earn you four stars in my book even if I didn't pick the lunch destination.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-louisville-2,3.24,3.24,3.24,,3.2400000000000007
8,Amber W.,"Jeffersonville, IN",1,26,4.0,5.0,2017-05-25,"Red Robin has been one of my favorite restaurant for 15+ years. Today's experience has been great as always. I never need a menu because I always get the amazingly delicious Banzi Burger with scrumptious bottomless fries. Our server was Dylan and he was fantastic. Our drinks were constantly being filled and he had a smile every time I saw him, (not just at the table, but while just walking around.) Truly a great family night out to dinner",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-louisville-2,3.4,3.4,3.4,,3.4000000000000004
11,Matt N.,"Lakewood, WA",0,7,1.0,5.0,2017-06-02,"Been to a lot of Red Robins, but this one is the best IMO. Probably because we've had Amy as our server the last few times we've come here. I change the cheese on my burger, we ask for extra sauces, or extra toppings and she always ensures we get our orders exactly as we wanted. It's pretty outstanding, because at other places we've been normally you need to ask several times for the extra ranch cup, or buzzard sauce for your fries. We always leave happy, and isn't that how you should feel after a night out? Major props to Amy for always making us want to come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-louisville-2,3.4,3.4,3.4,,3.4000000000000004

9,Larry B.,"Louisville, KY",36,14,,3.0,2017-10-16,"We went here right when it opened on a Saturday. One family was waiting by the door when we walked up. They opened about four minutes late but no big deal. They sat the family in front of us and then took about five minutes before seating us. There was two girls at the hostess stand so maybe there was some training going on. The hostess that took us back tried to seat us at a table that had dirty seats. It was strange that the seats were dirty because they just opened. She said she was going to get something to clean it up and would be back in a minute but we asked if we could sit at another table instead of waiting since all the tables except for one was empty. We sat down and our waitress came over quickly and took our drink orders. While she was getting our drinks we noticed the restaurant was getting busy rather quickly and our waitress was the only one. To sum everything up, the food was good but we didn't see our waitress much. The bottomless drinks and fries are not as great as advertised when you can't sit and waste your time waiting for them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-louisville-2,3.32,3.32,3.32,,3.3200000000000003
2,Tom G.,"Louisville, KY",12,107,383.0,4.0,2017-12-02,"We were seated promptly. Thought our wait time was quoted as 15-20 minutes, we got seated probably in more like 5-8 minutes. Been to Red Robin plenty of times but this is my first time to this location. Our waiter (Mike B.) was pretty cool, we decided to try an appetizer for the first time. We ordered their fried pickles. The meal was awesome. I ordered the same thing, the bacon cheeseburger. Our waiter made sure we had drinks and drinks to go.

4,Bernie G.,"Prospect, KY",0,1,,1.0,2017-12-31,"If you are hoping for $10.00 ""gourmet burger"", then avoid these guys all costs. I requested a ""pink"" burger and received one that was burnt to a crisp, probably refried. (Maybe that's why it took 20 minutes to get served.)  My beverage glass was filthy. It took a long time for anyone to recognize and seat me while  waiting at the front door. My ketchup bottle was empty. All this at 2:30PM at a time when they were not busy. Fries were soggy. The manager comp'd my half eaten meal... still no joy for a lousy meal. Very disappointing. .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-louisville-2,3.08,3.08,3.08,,3.0800000000000005
