8,Keith H.,"Fruita, CO",11,48,8.0,3.0,2012-07-08,Food was okay for red Robin. Nothing special. However the service was terrible because it took him anywhere between 5 to 10 minutes just to get drinks and our order.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-loveland?start=20,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004,2.9880000000000004

34,Logan M.,"Denver, CO",21,203,1.0,4.0,2013-03-06,"I know I'm not supposed to like this place because it's a horrible chain but I've never really had a bad experience at Red Robin (by design, of course).  My last visit was set up for failure: we called ahead with a party of 15, and still ended up waiting half an hour for a table.  The front of house was completely understaffed and the restaurant was slammed, but we got friendly, personal service and it really made for a great experience. The back of house is of course designed to crack out mediocre food and they came through in spades - my ""medium rare"" burger was on the done side of well, and it's a good thing the fries are bottomless, I didn't even need both hands to count the fries I got.  Luckily, our waitress had a great sense of humor and put in work.  Also, their buffalo wings have a really unique parmesan taste - they were probably the best thing I had all night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-loveland,3.152,3.152,3.152,3.152,3.152

9,Shane Z.,"Willard, UT",56,340,48.0,4.0,2013-04-30,It was a cold lonely night when I stopped in here. The snow had blanketed the ground and I think it had most people scared to venture out.  I ordered a normal burger and had them substitute grilled chicken instead.  There was only 1 other table being used so service and food was fast.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-loveland?start=20,3.12,3.12,3.12,3.12,3.1200000000000006
1,J E H.,"Monument, CO",0,44,1.0,2.0,2013-10-19,"Stopped here with three hungry kids on the way home from a swim meet. Decent food, but service was fairly lame and irritatingly slow.  Server seemed unable to manage multiple tables... food sat on the line for quite a while and my requested fries never arrived.  Overall, food tasted fine - burgers were good- but the overall experience was overshadowed by mediocre performance by the  waitstaff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-loveland?start=20,,,,,
4,Ashley H.,"Windsor, CO",84,202,43.0,5.0,2013-12-15,"Quick & easy. Royal Red Robin Burgers are so delicious. Their latest burger ""Smoke & Pepper Burger"" is the best I've had!

7,Tom S.,"Fort Collins, CO",0,4,,3.0,2015-01-02,"Some things in life are just worth waiting for. That's why you should not go to Red Robin at anything approaching a busy time. Even when they're not busy, the service sadly can only be described as lackluster. Sometimes the food at this location is really good, but sometimes it has been greasy and sloppily assembled. Just generally not worth a wait, but OK if is not busy and you're drinking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-loveland?start=20,,,,,
0,Melissa L.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",0,2,,1.0,2015-04-24,"I will never return to this restaurant ever again. We sat down and had our drink orders taken. When the waitress came to give us our drinks she spilled the entire tray on me, the drinks for our table and another. The manager never once came over and the only thing to be offered was a free dessert. When our food came out the order was incorrect and the waitress was super rude and argumentative about it. I mean how can a business have such horrible service? If I could give a negative star rating I would.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-loveland?start=20,,,,,

32,Allen R.,"Loveland, CO",1,6,,3.0,2015-08-28,My family and I used to enjoy coming here.  Now they have this ziosk thing that you use to order most of your stuff.  It really disconnects the server from you.  There is no personal touch to service anymore.  I don't feel compelled to tip the customary 15% anymore either.  If I'm doing more of the work and the server is doing less why should I still give a tip for my service to myself?  This is just a bad idea from the get go.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-loveland,,,,,

37,Mike G.,"Fort Collins, CO",0,5,,5.0,2016-03-21,"Best burgers in Ft.

I tried the lighter side menu , I had the bacon cheeseburger wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun and a generous side salad.

Haylie took care of us and was awesome. She took the time to explain things after learning we were unfamiliar with the restaurant and was very pleasant. The manager stopped by and was also very sweet. The food was VERY good! I ordered the Bonzai burger, and it was incredible. The menu is filled with more ""traditional"" options as well as unique ones. It surprised me how quickly appetizers, the burgers, refills, etc came out.

30,From C.,"Windsor, CO",0,72,,3.0,2016-07-10,I love Red Robin Burgers but I think sometimes your hit and miss with great dining service when you go to a franchised restaurant.

Food was fine, but all of the silverware was dirty, like it had not been washed.  Coffee was terrible, but I guess they are known for burgers and fries, not coffee.  The waitress was a shirt of grumpy/salty from the moment she finally got to our table. Bad day maybe.  Still sitting around waiting on a water refill nearly 30 min now.  If you like mediocre service and chain food, then this is your place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-loveland,3.68,3.68,3.68,,3.6800000000000006

29,Tina S.,"Loveland, CO",0,46,,1.0,2017-07-16,"Our family will no longer be going to Red Robin. The hamburgers are half the size now for $10.00. To get the normal size they used to serve all the time (1/2 pound) you have to pay $5.00 extra ($14.99). Ouch! I can buy 4 lbs of ground beef for that price. The buns were stale and they put a small tiny amount of fries on the plate. It is 'all you can eat fries,' but making the customer ask for more fries the minute they set the plate down is demeaning. It is so evident that they are hoping the customer will not order more. Truly, there are other places with much better hamburgers for a much better price. This is sad because I have gone to Red Robin since the 1990's, in many states, and I remember those delicious big hamburgers and huge amount of fries, and that is why we kept going back. Inflating their prices and shrinking their portions will only put them out of business. And this is not just happening in Loveland, CO. My sister in Indiana said they quit going for the exact same reason. They were really bothered by the small portions too. Red Robin, you are making a big mistake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-loveland,3.36,3.36,3.36,,3.3600000000000003
22,Marie E.,"Loveland, CO",7,42,,4.0,2017-08-09,Both my husband and I had the Banzai Burger. Delicious! I just wish the patties were a little bigger. It seems like they've decreased the size of the burgers over the years. I was very impressed with our server. She was so friendly when I talked to her about how neat the strawberry lemonade glasses were (the ones that are curved and have red stripes swirling around it). She told us that those glasses are for sale on  . I had no idea!
