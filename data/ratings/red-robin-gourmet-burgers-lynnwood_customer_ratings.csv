174,Lindsay P.,"Lake Stevens, WA",209,310,19.0,4.0,2012-01-05,"Red Robin is Red Robin; you get mass produced burgers, fries and sandwiches for a moderate price. It's a staple; you can pretty much always count on it being decent. Service is typically pretty decent and pretty fast, and if it's not they always make up for it. More recently we went so we could eat lunch and watch the Seahawks get clobbered in the bar. I was a little dismayed at just how expensive the house margarita was, at $7. I ordered the blue ribbon burger, and Cam had the Whiskey River BBQ Chicken burger. As I said above, pretty much always decent.  We keep coming back, but we try to limit our visits to once or twice a year.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lynnwood?start=160,3.52,3.52,3.52,3.088,3.5200000000000005

It gets busy especially on the weekends. My wife and I have never had to wait to long for a seat. I love the variety of burgers, sandwiches, wraps and salads you can choose from. My favorite burger is the A-1 Peppercorn burger and it costs $10.39. The burger comes with applewood smoked bacon, melted pepper-jack cheese, A.1. peppercorn spread, crispy onion straws and tomatoes on an onion bun. Oh yeah you can't forget the bottom less steak fries which are delicious!!!! Another item I love to order is the Rookie Magic Shake or go with the classic chocolate shake and get them monster sized for $4.49.

175,kayla a.,"Lynnwood, WA",0,27,3.0,3.0,2012-04-15,"It's really hard to write a review for this place, even though I eat there all the time, the most simple thing I can say is, is that this Red Robin is consistently, inconsistent. One night you can have an amazing server, and one of the best burgers of your life, the next time you can have have terrible food, and a waitress/waiter who basically only takes your order, brings your drink, someone else from the kitchen brings your food, and by the time your half through with your meal, your server appears once again, with your bill, and it's not even a busy night.  I will say though, that  their food is kind of bland, and for the most part relies on their seasoning mostly comprised of salt for flavor. But Red Robin offers reasonable prices, and a nice environment for a casual meal. And I know other people love 'em, but I've never been a fan of their freckled lemonades But they do make good drinks at the bar, if I was judging solely based on the bar, I would give it 5 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lynnwood?start=160,3.56,3.56,3.56,2.7960000000000003,3.5600000000000005

167,Brittanie B.,"Seattle, WA",12,2,1.0,1.0,2012-07-06,"Came Here a few nights ago for a going away party. The host was super friendly and we were happy waiting twenty minutes to be sat. We went to the bar and there was no bartender to serve us. After trying to get attention from someone, anyone for 15 minutes, we gave up.  Ten minutes later we were sat. The table was sticky and I asked for a rag to clean it. I never got one.  We had a short blonde haired server who asked how we were splitting up our bills before we even ordered food. Very unprofessional. It took twenty minutes to get us a few beers. She was both snotty and seemingly stuck up. Our food was decent, but a bad server can ruin any experience.

173,Doug M.,"Edmonds, WA",18,359,6.0,2.0,2012-08-05,"I went to a Red Robin once about 20 years ago and was not all that impressed. I could not remember why. My wife and I dropped in to this one today. We had turkey clubs that seemed to have a thin slice of pressed turkey product (not fresh turkey breast) and  the bread was held together with gobs of cheese. I'm not big on cheese so this may be one of my problems with RR.  The food seems really overpriced for the amount and quality provided. The allegedly bottomless fries are served to you at about 7 fries at a time. I guess for the truly patient they could score a lot of fries. I'd rather get a full order first time around and be done with it. Service was very good. The dining area was noisy, the music was too loud. I basically don't like this place. Maybe I'll try it again in 20 years or so.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lynnwood?start=160,3.4,3.4,3.4,2.6640000000000006,3.4000000000000004
149,Tirza M.,"Kirkland, WA",54,16,,2.0,2012-08-07,"Disclaimer: This review is only for this location. I have always liked Red Robin. Good burgers (my go-to burger is the Royal Red Robin), steak fries, etc. I usually go to the Bellevue Square Red Robin because of the location's convenience. I've always liked going to Red Robin; they have great service and really friendly staff. So when I went to David's Bridal with a couple of my girlfriends, we decided to go to Red Robin in Alderwood/Lynnwood. I was deeply disappointed. The service was ridiculously bad. First, the server messed up my friend's salad. She ordered a Southwest Grilled Chicken Salad with a few personalization. When it came, it was wrong. The chicken was just a plain grilled chicken, not seasoned like it was supposed to be. My friend mentioned this to our server, and he said that he ordered it that way because he thought she didn't want any seasoning. (She had ordered her dressing on the side.) He just assumed that she didn't want seasoned chicken. My friend started to give back the plate, but our server said, ""Oh, I'll just get you another chicken."" My friend wasn't happy. He then relented and took her plate, offering to make a new one. Second, we had ordered a basket of fries to share, and our server failed to bring that out. He eventually did, but it was towards the end of our meal! Another server then brought us another basket of fries. At the end of our meal, we had 2 baskets of fries... That was a waste of fries (and our time). The other server, the one that brought us our extra basket of fries was also very rude to us.  Third, when we decided that we should just pay and get out of there, our server messed up the bill. We did separate checks, which has never been a problem at any Red Robin locations I've visited. Both me and my friend have Red Royalty Rewards Cards. He took our cards and mixed up our bills - I got my friend's free burger, and her order was put on my card. It was confusing and frustrating, to say the least. I would have given a 1-star, because we left the establishment more frustrated than when we came in. However, since the food tasted good (Red Robin standard), I decided to give another star. I understand that people have bad days. Maybe our server had a bad day. Maybe our server was new to the job. It was just mistakes after mistakes, without any explanation or proper apologies. We were frustrated. I might just stick with the other Red Robin locations in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lynnwood?start=140,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.7280000000000006,3.2800000000000002

BOttom line drinks were terrible.

They came perfectly and crazy fast for how busy they were!  The server was great and I watched how all the servers were moving about the floor. Very efficient and friendly. There was a man on the floor wh must have been a main manager.....you can tell a lot about a manager based on how the staff acts around him.

They would be bringing out baskets of fries for everyone while we waited for our food. The environment was fun and exciting.  Unfortunately, it just wasn't the same. The food was still good. The variety still unique and tasty, but seeing that our waitress mixed up our orders, put the wrong things on the wrong bills, never once filled up our water, and even forgot to bring people things they had ordered, I can't really give it the 4-5 stars that it used to be.

Tyler made us feel like we could have stayed and talked for 2 more hours, coming by and checking if we needed more fries, bringing extra sauces for us and refilling drinks before we had to ask. The good thing for Tyler is that all 3 of us work in a tipping industry and we all commented on how great he was as a server and tipped him generously.

He thought that if they could just get their food, they'd calm down so we stayed. As we were seated, Donetta promptly took our order and we just ordered 1 kids meal for my kids to split. Without even asking, she had it out on two separate plates ( win!!! ) in less than five minutes. What!? So my kids instantly became happier! She had our food out not much longer after that. She checked on us frequently and when my son was finished eating ( he's 15 months ) she played peekaboo with him from behind the bar. She laughed and giggled with him and I'm pretty sure he developed his first girl crush, hehe. Moms know how it is...

Food came in an orderly time, but the waitress messed up my order. Its funny because when I ordered I was very specific about my cod burger. I did want want the shredded cabagge. Somehow she mixed it up with a fried chicken burger?...and when I mentioned to her that my order was wrong she huffed and puffed. -Rude and unprofessional too say the least....food tasted well.

I ordered the bacon pepper burger ($14.99) which isn't the typical choice for me but I thought hey that looks like a good burger versus my normal clucks and fries or chicken salad. Well we had to wait to order our food and the time to receive our food was ridiculous. When I got my burger it wasn't warm at all. I don't need it piping hot but at least some warmth come on. Let me feel like my burger was sitting there for a while. I never got the sauce that I asked for so I just got annoyed and went up and got it myself. The burger was suppose to come with pickles (the best part in my opinion) and didn't so I had to ask for that. And to top it off my sisters egg on her royal burger wasn't cooked all the way. The WHITE PART. I mean that's gross. Burgary looking stuff on a burger. Blehh annd they charged her for it so she wasn't having it. I told the waitress and she said that's something a manager has to approve. Needless to say the service here has never been spectacular to me so you won't see me run here anytime soon. I always go to bothell or woodinville (my favorite) because I know I'll get good service.

Oh and those high chairs for the baby's to sit in are absolutely horrendous......disgustingly dirty. I had to use 10 baby wipes to clean it so my son could sit in it. I will never go there again .

Came here with my family for a dinner and the wait wasn't too bad. If you come here at peak dinner time, expect at least a 20 min+ wait. RR doesn't take any reservations, so keep an ear out for when the hostess/host calls your name. When we finally got seated, we were greeted with a super cheerful waitress who throughout the evening, provided great service and attention to whatever we needed. For food, we ordered a variety of things: tower of onions, teriyaki flavored boneless chicken wings, mix of entrees, and drinks. Food quality in general here is great. Not only are the food hot and fresh (compared to other locations, the food is often lukewarm or sometimes cold), but we didn't wait very long for our meals.  The tower of onion rings were delicious. Crispy and hot, and paired with ranch and honey mustard sauce, it's one solid appetizer. As for the teriyaki wings, these were super crunchy and the sauce itself wasn't too overwhelming. For me, I decided to venture on the healthy side and tried a burger with a lettuce substitute instead of buns and that proved to be quite good and flavorful.  For sauces to eat with your fries/burger, I highly recommend trying out: Campfire, Buzzard, Honey Mustard, and the Bacon sauce. All of these were super yummy and added a nice flavor to the food.

We were here on a busy weeknight around dinner time and were scoping out the bar for a table to sit sooner than the regular space. Once seated, the table was cleared off quickly by a passing busser, which was a good sign. We met our server, he left menus and came back a few minutes later to ask for our drink order. We weren't really drinking anything, so we both asked for waters and said we were ready to order if that was okay. The server actually said no, he wouldn't take our order now as he wanted to take people's orders in the order they arrived. I was like: Okay, sure, thanks. Really though? This is the bar, it's first come, first served. We're ready to order. We didn't have drinks to order, so we were ready to order food. He could have said anything else to delay taking our order: I need to get my notepad, I will when I come back with your waters, anything else. Really? He came by with our waters and had his pen out to take our orders. We were both starving, so I asked that our fries come out early. He said: No. Again. I was like: Uh..... He said: Well, I doubt that'll happen. I was like: Okay. This restaurant is known for their bottomless fries, fries is most of the business. Come on, now.  Our early fries did come out, which was appreciated. Then another person brought out our burgers and I figured I'd ask HER for more fries in advance. She said she'd tell our server (inward groan). He came by to ask how everything was going a few minutes later and I asked for fries then, which we got. I was really hungry.  By now, the bar/restaurant was less crazy. So I think he felt less stressed and became a better server. On the surface, we got everything we asked for, in a reasonable amount of time, but his demeanor in the beginning was pretty bad.

Its one of the few chain restaurants where I can easily get a Boca burger and still make my other dining partners happy. The menu seems to always be adding new things and has a lot of options for people who don't like burgers, however convincing them of this can be hard. I also love that they ask you what sauce you want for your fries when you order as I am one of those people who do not like ketchup. Or if you are on a health kick you can get salad or broccoli instead. Everything here is very customizable and the nutrition calculator online is pretty great too.  I also find that the bar is a pretty nice place just to meet someone for drinks. Or to have a meal before heading off to the movie theater across the street. Service is usually fast and efficient. Its even nicer now that you can pay from the kiosk at your table, although it only allows you to order drinks and appetizers. Refills here come easily. It can be a bit loud and table wait times can be long. I almost always peek in the bar before getting on list if I don't have children with me since this is usually a faster way to get services.

I don't have pics because this is the first review Iv'e done and didn't think I'd be doing this. My experience tonight was that bad to make me actually sign up to do so.However, you don't need a picture to understand my discrepancy with this place. To begin with, when we entered the place and were waiting for a seat, I went in to use the ladies room.There are 3 bathroom stalls, and the one closest to the wall was a handicap one gushing with water pouring over and running through the 2 other stalls. There was a tiny hot pink post it note on the door which read ""out of order"" with a smile face. When we  were seated, they crammed us into the most awkward corner, even though there were plenty of booths and seats available. I literally couldn't clear the corner, and I'm not a big woman. To the waiters credit, he saw this and offered to connect the two tables together, as the one could not seat 3 of us.When we ordered our drinks, ( 3 of us, with one being a water only)my chardonnay came out red. No big deal, mistakes happen. Before our food came out, the people next to us had to have the manager come over because their bill was wrong.I'll try and speed this up...one of the orders had an egg on top of the burger, and it was burnt, hard and brown inedible till the edges were torn away.

On my last visit there, we received terrible service, culminating with our server literally snatching the tabletop payment device out of my hand while I was in the middle of writing. She showed up after I had paid my bill using the device (since she delivered our food and disappeared forever) and I was in the process of writing a review. She asked if I received a receipt, to which I replied, no, but I didn't request one. Without another word, she took the device from me and hurried away, no explanation, no stopping and turning back even when I said, ""hey, I was in the middle of something."" She just scurried away. As I was leaving, I encountered the manager and truthfully told him that I was rather shocked by that interaction. He looked at me blankly as if he didn't have a clue how to simply apologize for the brusque and rude behavior of the server. Well, okay.

Then I would have shown them how the coupon was deceptive, and I could have used it at a time when I understood their hidden rules.

Came in about 4:45pm after a conference and before going to the mall.  We had to wait about 12 minutes to get a booth.  Place was dirty especially the floors.  1st miss was they just raised the price of the wedge salad appetizer from $3.00 to $5.00 and new wording on menu says it's big enough to share.  We normally get 2 but thought maybe based on the wording and change in price it was bigger. WRONG!!!! Same size almost twice the price. My wife ordered fish and chips with garlic fries substituted and I ordered the Royal Red Robins burger.  My burger was OK but fries old and cold.   My wife's fish was hot but small and soaked I'm oil.  My wife complained to our server PaytonS about her fish. He looked at it and agreed the pieces seemed small then quips ""but I haven't ordered them for awhile so I'm not sure.""  That was it......didn't offer to bring maybe another piece or given the complaint about size and being soaked in oil didn't offer to get new order.  Didn't even see fit to bring it to managers attention.  So because he hadn't ordered them in awhile he figured it wasn't a problem......tough luck. Although we both had bottomless fries PaytonS didn't bother to offer a refill, I had to ask for the refills.  Another server brought them out. 2 minutes later Payton comes back with 2 baskets of fries and says looks likes you got your fries. It looks like he was a bit slow and the other server covered for him but instead of offering us the other baskets he takes them over to 2 girls and asks them if they want some free fries.  Seriously? You looking to get some didgits?  I had also ordered a bottomless Root beer float.  Again I had to ask him for a refill instead of being offered.  The 2nd time I asked for a refill he said he'd bring other right out.  After ""attending"" the girls he gave the free fries to hear see the empty glass I put at the edge of the table and asks if I'd like a refill.  I said I thought you were suppose to be getting it because I already asked you for a refill.  ""Oh yeah...."" The float arrived but by a different server not PaytonS.

First of all, we were greater with a pleasant smile and they seated us right away even during a busy time (we were there at around 6 pm).  Our waitress, Courtney was beyond amazing! She was very friendly, professional, and was very prompt with getting our orders, giving us several baskets of fries (and they were extra crispy like I asked every time! ) with requested sauces before our meals came, checking in on us, and refilling our waters.  The food was pretty good and wasn't overly greasy like we have had in the past that had made us sick. We boyfriend and I both ordered Tavern Double's but as lettuce wraps. Mine was a little messy to eat and had to with a fork and knife while his was a little neater and easy to eat with just his hands. The Donut Short is also to amazing! Highly recommend dipping them in both sauces! Overall, we were very happy with our experience and will come back again.

9,Tracey W.,"Seattle, WA",882,34,20.0,1.0,2017-10-28,"Oh, Red Robin - what has happened to you? We used to be able to rely on good food and decent service, but that isn't the case any more. Came in today for lunch. We put our order in, got our drinks and mozarella sticks. We NEVER get ranch the first time, even though we ask for it specifically. And, that's when things went downhill. We waited, and waited, and waited. We watched families get seated and get their food and we continued to wait. Our server offered to bring us some french fries. Cool...then we waited some more. Maybe 15 minutes later, she brought us the most pathetic looking basket of fries. She asked us what kind of sauce and we said Ranch. She brought us 5 different sauces, that were spilling over onto the fries. We didn't want those other sauces, just ranch.  Then, we waited some more... By the time our food arrived, we needed to leave (almost an hour at this point), so we asked for the food to go. Our server offered us extra fries, extra sauces, and a dessert - none of which were received. Oh, and the check was wrong, and the table top checkout machine was broken... A complete cluster.  I think we've learned our lesson and we won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lynnwood,2.68,2.8,2.8,,2.7520000000000002
35,Amber G.,"Everett, WA",80,9,1.0,1.0,2017-10-30,"First off, I do not want to blame the waitress for this visit but it was absolutely terrible. I came in with some mom friends and our kids, altogether there were 7 kids and 5 adults. It took about 20 minutes to be seated which was understandable with us being 12 people altogether. But then they were out of a lot of things. One of my friends wanted a baileys shake and they were out of ice cream another one of my friends wanted a lemonade refill and they were out of that. They then asked for a orange cream soda and they happened to be out of that too. We then waited for over and hour and a half for our food to be brought to the table. Over half of our party cancelled their order and left because of how long it was taking and as they were leaving we were being informed that they had also ran out of nachos which is what one of them ordered. The rest of us that were left just packed up our food and went home. We still had to pay for our food, eat it cold when we got home, and for this service? It was just ridiculous. I don't know if I ever want to return to a Red Robin again after this. Also, maybe someone should be trained better on ordering food items on the truck orders, working in food myself I understand running out of a few items, but it was quite ridiculous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lynnwood?start=20,2.64,2.76,2.76,,2.712

I went there last night and had to eat a patty that I hated since that was the only vegan option. Please bring it back, I really don't want to stop coming to Red Robin.

3,Domonique B.,"Edmonds, WA",154,13,,1.0,2017-11-25,"This establishment of RR is the worst that I've been to. Online ordering is helpful to have, but with every time we've ordered, there is something that comes home with us that 1.) should not be there or 2.) is missing. I have emailed customer service about this and they only apologize and send you with a $15-$20 gift card.  Tonight we tried ordering online, in a last minute choice of dinner. I had been craving clam chowder and had a head cold, so YES!! I was being lazy and not wanting to make myself some and instead depended on a restaurant to make it for me instead. Big mistake! The online ordering said to call the store instead, unsure as to why, we decided to anyhow. We had someone pick up in about 3 rings, and when we told them how we wanted to place an order to go, they told us to wait on hold and they'd have the order to go specialist speak to us... I'm currently still on hold and have been for about 20 minutes now. So frustrating!!! Please, if you decide to order online, save yourself the trouble and just... Don't.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lynnwood,2.44,2.7,2.7,,2.596

Our server forgot our appetizer order but had brought tons of fries prior to our meal coming out so we didn't need it anyway. My sisters burger also had onions when she said no onions but that could have been the cooks. Pretty much the same burger quality anywhere you go, decent fast food. I will say at this location it's a little chilly because it's mostly windows so dress accordingly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lynnwood,2.4,2.72,3.056,,2.592

2,Misty V.,"Lynnwood, WA",0,2,,1.0,2017-12-17,"I always have a hard time getting what I order when I call in an order. I always request extra fries...there's a good chance I don't get those fries. One of those times, I noticed no extra fries...so I asked the guy helping me if I could get them still, I told him I ordered them on the phone with the rest of my order and for some reason this keeps happening, he said ""well it wasn't part of your order""...what?!...that was his only response! Another time I requested the double berry cheesecake to go and when I got home I found out I didn't get any of the toppings...just a plain cheesecake. Also a theme I've noticed, they always ask if I want ketchup and cutlery with my order and I ALWAYS say no. However, I ALWAYS end up with it in my bag. Why bother asking if they're just going to put it in there? Today I was starving and called to order a Taco Tavern Double with extra fries. I've never had this burger before and wanted to try it. I should have taken a picture of of it. First off, it was definitely more cool than warm, I waited an additional 30min to pick it up when I got there, so it was probably just sitting there as two others were helped before me. The burger was tiny, nothing like the picture you see online. I didn't see ANY of the toppings and there was ONE patty, not two, as stated. I thought it was a simple cheeseburger, no joke. Ridiculous.  I was going to go back to the restaurant but decided not to because I didn't want to wait again and I was hungry so I ate it. It did in fact have the toppings but very little and in the middle of the burger. The salsa had soaked into the top bun because of it sitting too long. Also, of course, I did not get my extra fries. So not only was the burger nothing like the picture you see online, it was CHILD SIZE with very little toppings in the center. Also, I did not get the extra fries I asked for even though it was on the receipt he gave me. I'm not sure what's going on there but that was it for me. The to-go ordering system does not seem to work.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lynnwood,2.32,2.69,3.032,,2.542

The waiter seemed extremely rushed and impolite. Heres the kicker though. When he brought my food he dropped into my lap, said a quick half assed apology and walked away. Not even offering to help me clean myself up. Then on top of that one of my family members' food was not brought out till we were almost done eating. The waiter (Jeffery) did not offer to comp the meal, so I talked to the manager and she was nice enough to do so.  My expectations are never sky high going into a chain restaurant like this, but I sincerely hope that this restaurant reads their reviews and considers what I have to say.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-lynnwood,2.32,2.67,3.02,,2.5300000000000002
12,Scott V.,"Seattle, WA",0,48,,2.0,2017-12-18,"I used to love this place. How can you screw up a hamburger when it is your signature dish? I ordered the A-1 burger and it was pretty boring. No much flavor and kinda lukewarm when it arrived. After a couple bites I decided to try just the meat and it was pretty flavorless and very dry, despite ordering it medium rare.  Fries that came with burger and subsequent re-order both limp and cold. Bloody Mary didn't taste like it had any vodka in it. I knew I should have just ordered the Cobb salad, which is always solid.

When we got to the To-Go podium there was already a woman waiting there in line with no one helping her while the two hosts were standing at the podium next to it (one was laying on it) talking about how it was so busy they wanted to die. After 5 minutes someone came out the back to help the woman then immediately walked away leaving us waiting for another 8 minutes while our order was clearly sitting on the table ready the entire time we were there. She finally came back just to have the hostess who was laying on the podium come over so they could complain about their co-worker. Finally we were helped, and by that time our food was no longer warm. The food was delicious as always however.

I sat facing the interior of the bar area. I watched an employee fill the ice cream machine and then take several garbage cans out. He came back in a few mins. and put cans back under counters. Then without washing his hands he turned around and opened the ice cream machine looked inside  and stood ther with both hands on the top of the machine chit chatting with the bartender. Then he turned and started doing something at the bar. It's a very small skinny area and literally u can turn around and touch the counter. He never once washed his hands.
