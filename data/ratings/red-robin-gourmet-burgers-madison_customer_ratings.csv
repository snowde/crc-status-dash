The amount of Fries served was more than enough where asking for endless ones was not needed. Can't say either of us was impressed with the burgers. Both of us thought it was similar to meatloaf or had a filler (though that's doubtful).

The staff is friendly though I think where they are dropping the ball is the way the call in food service is setup. 1. the person that answers the phone is not the person whom will order your food, but transfer your call to . . . . . . the bar.  2. this transfer will put you on hold from 3 to 5 minutes (from my last three times i have tried to experience decent phone call in) 3. when they pickup they take your order but they are not wait staff, it is a bartender.

The ambience is hit or miss.  If you have a family the good thing is that it is loud.  No one will care if your kid screams once in a while because the place already has a healthy din.  However, the seating can be good or it can be a nightmare.  They have some really long benches that they line up several tables at and put them about 1.5 feet apart from one another.  When we get our own table, it is great.  When we are put on one of those bench tables, it is infuriating and there isn't enough space to deal with small children.

""Bottomless"" fries.  Here's a thought.  Bring out enough fries from the start.  My last trip I had 7 fries in my chrome fry tube.  Seriously.  7.  I wasn't sure if they didn't have any left, or if the chef was hinting that i could lose a few lbs.  I wanted more fries, but you would have a better chance finding Kim Kardashian's virginity, before you found our waiter. Attentive wait staff.  You are here to work, not talk about your date tonight, flirt with co- workers or stand and look out the window.   How about you check on your guests.  Ask them if they want refills (fries and soda) and maybe grab a mop and bucket and keep the place clean.  Another problem here is the condition of the place.

Their fries are perfect - thick cut, perfectly fried, piping hot and nicely salted.  My burger came out nice and hot the second time with hardly any pink, which was just fine.  In the meanwhile I stole a bite of my husband's whiskey bbq and thought it was perfection.  I usually am not a huge fan of bbq on a burger but this was a perfect marriage of tastes.  Too bad I didn't order that one, because the Shroom burger was flat in comparison.  Nice but the mushrooms didn't have much flavor.  I'll be back when I crave a burger again, but I'll have the whiskey bbq next time.  Full speed ahead and damn the calories.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-madison?start=40,3.3440000000000003,3.3440000000000003,3.3440000000000003,3.3440000000000003,3.3440000000000003

11,Stacey L.,"Madison, WI",1587,968,1680.0,3.0,2015-09-08,"I recently got to re-live my youth by having lunch at Red Robin recently. When I was in middle and high school out in Pennsylvania, this was THE PLACE to go. Probably because it shared a parking lot with a movie theater, one of the few activities for kids in my metro.  RR has undergone a bit of identity change - it's still got all the pieces of flair on the wall that haven't changed since the late 90s when I started going, and the signature menu items are there, but they seem to be branding their menu up and have increased the prices to match. A $15 burger, Red Robin? Really?  Most of their items are in line with any major ""neighborhood bar and grill"" chain, though, and they're probably my favorite among their peers. They consider ""anything between two buns"" a burger, so I was easily able to swap a grilled chicken patty in for their A1 Peppercorn burger. Unfortunately, the chicken had kind of a weird texture, but it looked and tasted fine so I rolled with it. The steak fries are still as delicious as I remembered them, and they've still got the poppyseed dressing that I dunk them into with abandon.  Our server on this trip was very nice but a little discombobulated - he was running around like a madman and carrying several different orders at a time, which led to some sloppiness. My to-go box, for example, had its inside christened with melted vanilla milkshake.  On a good day, I could maybe bump them up to four stars (they are what they are, and I'm not going to ding them for being a chain), but the freezing temperature (I was still uncomfortable wearing both my and my boyfriend's hoodies) and crowded, awkward parking lot just weren't my jam.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-madison,3.2440000000000007,3.2440000000000007,3.2440000000000007,3.2440000000000007,3.2440000000000007

46,Candy C.,"Madison, WI",7,13,6.0,1.0,2016-03-10,"We ate at the ET RR last week and both got sick. I contacted RR by email leaving info and no response. Got a survey later in the week and left details, no response. We shared a burger, both had fries, my mother had a small strawberry shake and I had half a crab cake burger, a few fries, root beer float (mostly root beer) and a little water with lemon. The $14 crab burger was overpriced, a bit rich and came with oily toppings. There was something like a pimento which overwhelmed. Crisp crab cake, lettuce, simple or choice of topping, lemon, was what I was looking for. My mother didn't care for the simple burger which I thought was okay, but not $9 bucks of okay. She wasn't impressed w/the shake which didn't measure up to A&W or Micky D's in her book. The fries were luke warm and lifeless so neither of us ate many. If we had been offered refills as advertised, maybe those fries would have been better. Or more appropriately, ""Are your fries okay?"" cuz they were pretty much uneaten. No refill on the bottomless float either--a sloppy pour with a dollop of ice cream and mostly foam. There wasn't even 1/2 a glass there and I did get more root beer, but no more float. The tablespoon of ice cream was tasty. The waiter was surly, seemed resentful he had to wait tables and looked like walking road rage.  The table was dirty, the restaurant was full of yelling kids which I don't care about, but some might.  The kids menu has Mac n Cheese, a burger, grilled cheese bites, pasta, pizza, little corn dogs and more from about $4-$5.00. Interesting that the table kiosk automatically started the tip at 20%. Also interesting that the place was so busy on an early Sunday night with school the next day.

We knew what we wanted to order. Our waiter seemed disappointed when we didn't want alcoholic drinks or an appetizer. After our burgers came he treated us as almost an afterthought. He acted like it was a hassle to bring us some more ""bottomless"" fries. And I was never even offered a refill on my coke. I noticed he gave much better service to a family of 4 across the way. I guess in order to get good service, you need to come in with a large party or have kids.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-madison?start=20,3.52,3.52,3.52,,3.5200000000000005

49,Anne G.,"Madison, WI",3,57,,4.0,2016-05-26,"One of my kids has a severe tree nut and peanut allergy, so we don't eat out often. When we do, our choices are limited to fast food or chains like Red Robin that provide allergen information online or allergen menus in their restaurants. My ""allergy kid"" adores burgers of all kinds, so Red Robin is his culinary heaven. Red Robin is expensive (I'd rather spend $60 on sushi myself), but checks all our boxes: allergen menu and a lot of food (i.e. BURGERS) he can choose from. Would I seek out Red Robin on my own? Probably not ... I prefer to eat Asian food or finer dining when without the kids. But it allows us to eat out as a family on a level above Culver's with healthier options for us adults. The food's decent and I've never walked out of there hungry or sorry we bothered.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-madison?start=20,3.6,3.6,3.6,,3.6000000000000005

Options for other sides than fries & they are happy to remove topping on your sandwich you may not care for. You can't go wrong for a standard chain meal here. Coupled with paying with Ziosk you can get in & out of here efficiently.  The hidden secret to chain restaurants like this (so Chili's would be in this category) is if it's just the two of you, request or seat yourself in the bar area. People often don't think of that option so waitstaff may not get the tips. Because of this we always get excellent service. Finally, they have a generous rewards program offering a full meal after so many visits instead of just an appetizer or dessert that we'd never take advantage of. Besides rewards we get emails offering worthwhile discounts. Keeps us coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-madison,3.76,3.76,3.76,,3.76

Decent seasoning. My 14yo had the fish and chips which he enjoyed. I had a bite of his fish and thought it was pretty good. My husband ordered the nacho burger and we are pretty sure he did not actually receive the nacho burger. Shame on us I guess for not saying something, but it ended up being okay, whatever kind of burger it was. When ""and brews"" is on your sign, I guess I'm expecting some better options. Very few, what I would consider craft, options on draft. Had some okay craft bottle options, but not many. I don't think their beer menu is much more than it was when they didn't have ""and brews"" on the sign.  Overall it was okay, but there are so many better options in Madison, I think we'll check those out instead from now on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-madison,3.76,3.76,3.76,,3.76

Just a really salty grilled cheese sandwich for my daughter. She nibbled at the cheese and ate her broccoli and that was about it. I think it's cool that they had tablets available to serve as a distraction for kids while we wait for food. They gave my daughter a balloon, which was really nice. The margarita was good.
