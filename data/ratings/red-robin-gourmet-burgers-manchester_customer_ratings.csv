67,Monkey C.,"Framingham, MA",8,62,2.0,5.0,2012-09-05,"This is a really good Red Robin.  Some of them stink (the one up in Enfield as a matter o fact).  Some of them are really good.  This one is one of the good ones.  Wait staff are excellent, always getting back to us, following up, then always being pleasant, accommodating and fast.  They don't malinger.  They do their job.  THANK YOU WAIT STAFF.  First off, we did not come here for years because of a raw burger snafu.  We couldn't get a burger cooked.  It kept coming out raw.  We'd send it back and they'd send another raw burger.  I don't know what that was about but it was kind of nightmarish...you'd bite in and it was okay and then bite again and the cow would moo.  Then we went home and waited for the salmonella we were sure we had eaten to set in. But we picked up a couple of groupons, and they are rated by someone as THE BEST BURGER or something so we figured we'd give them another shot.  And lo and behold, they have become amazingly uberGOOD. Frankly I wish we had picked up more, but these couple will do.  Because their service and burgers and other fried fare are superb.   Last night I had a fish and chips with a few shrimp thrown in that was unreal good. I'm not saying the shrimp or the fish were of exceptional quality.  They were typical, but they were fried to perfection!   PLUS before that we had other fried items as our appetizers: onions rings and cheese sticks.  LOTS of them.  They give you lots.  And you eat it all because it's delicious.  And the sauces you dip this stuff into are even more delicious.   The classic burger, whatever they call it is out of this world.  I like the one with the sweated onions, but I don't like bread so I have them put it on lettuce.  Between all the perfectly cooked, delicious meat and cheese and really fresh lettuce and firm sliced tomatoes and sauces, not to mention fantabulous endless fries, I have died and gone to heaven.  Or will just that much sooner because no doubt this isn't exactly good for you, unless you're badly in need of a fat injection.   But no one going to a burger joint really cares about those things.  At least I don't. BTW, I gave it five stars because THIS is what I want from a burger joint! Juicy burgers made with delicous meat and delectable fried other stuff.  And exactly the right amount of attention from their staff.   I have to chuckle at anyone who might consider ordering a salad as their entre at Red Robin.  You are there to laugh at death!  And death laughs back! In the background, you may hear your heart moan ominously.  It's all very Ingmar Bergmanesque.  Deliciously so.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-manchester?start=60,3.44,3.44,3.44,3.0280000000000005,3.4400000000000004

59,Alfred F.,"Hartford, CT",123,193,197.0,4.0,2013-02-27,"Went here with my wife and daughters to celebrate a birthday (not mine). The place was busy as usual, with balloons being filled, and kids lining up to lose their parents' money in the Claw machines...but I digress. We were sat in a reasonable amount of time. Our server came by with full hands in a few seconds, letting us know he would be right with us. Sometimes it's the little things that tilt a restaurant experience, and Mike certainly had it down. He came by and took our order, which included their Towering Onion Rings, three burgers of various sorts and a grilled chicken sandwich. The onion rings are always hot, fresh and crispy, with ranch and Baja (spicier) ranch dressings to dip. My wife ordered a mushroom Swiss burger - with sauteed onions, and no bun, and a salad instead of fries. I ordered their ""Burnin' Love"" burger, which had cayenne seasoning, pepperjack cheese, L&T, all on a corn-jalapeno bun. Amazingly good. Everything we ordered came out exactly as requested...a great time-saver for the wait-staff and cook crew, I'm sure! The fries were perfectly cooked, not greasy, and went very well with their exclusive Red Robin seasoning blend that is perched (pardon the pun) on every table. Drinks included diet sodas, for wich there were refills waiting just as we finished the last few sips. Also the signature Freckled Lemonade, with bits o' strawberry. All paled in comparison and creativity to the Guinness Shake! This was a chocolate milk shake that had the famous stout, as well as a small shot of Jameisons Irish Whisky. The combo was actually not bad, although it was so wonderfully thick it would be all but impossible to drink enough of them to catch a buzz! The crew brought out a birthday sundae for my wife, who is now &^*&* years old...haha I'll never tell! All in all the experience was a lot moer memorable that what anyone should expect from a national chain restaurant.

My most recent visit was less than on par, and sealed my decision to just not re-visit. In the past, the food has always been greasy and very ""fast foodish"" at best. During this visit, I got the feeling that the wiatstaff really didn't care for their job, and it showed by how unattentive they were.  My girlfriend and I stopped here as it was a good meeting point between myself and someone I was selling car parts to. We decided to grab a beer and some onion rings out on the patio while we were there. I'm glad we only wanted one beer each, since nobody ever came back to check up on us after bring them over. I noticed that the other patio tables were waited on fairly often, yet ours didn't get that same attention. Once we were done eating and were ready to pay, we had to wait a while before the check was even delivered. I noticed that our server was also working behind the bar. Normally this wouldn't have been an issue at all. Unfortunately, the patrons at the bar were attended to instantly and we were left outside to just wait until she was ready to come out to us.

But the server said ""We'll try but we usually only do medium."" Huh? I had heard another server actually tell her guests that they couldn't serve anything less than medium because of liability issues. Seriously? Good to see a chain stand behind the quality of their ingredients. Well, my wife's burger came out brown throughout. Nowhere even close to medium. My guess is, the volume here is so high that they just throw a thousand burgers on the grill at one time and you get whatever is ready when your order comes up.

Not like other places that barely put a slice on and call it a day.  I don't eat potatoes so I never get the bottomless steak fries.  I opted for a side salad which is bottomless as well.  For dressing I wanted oil and vinegar which was no problem.   When that came out though the oil bottle was very oily and quite sticky.  Obviously they don't wash the bottle before they pour more oil into it.  And we received an order of fries.  We didn't touch it and our waiter told us that they're on the house even though we didn't order them with our meal.   Overall pleasant experience besides the oil situation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-manchester?start=20,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.8000000000000003,3.1600000000000006

It's been a year or two since I've had Red Robin, since the only one close to me back in Columbus shut down. I've always enjoyed their burgers and the unlimited fries (along with the seasoning) so there isn't much to complain about. On this latest trip, I realized they've really added a lot to the menu, or least a lot more burgers. I thought they had a ton of burgers before, but it looked like they added a whole new page. I actually went with the Tavern burger, because you can 'style' it to your choosing, and I went with the 'Fiery Ghost' style, which adds their ghost pepper sauce and fried and fresh jalapenos to the burger. I think I added bacon is well, because that sounds like something I'd do. All-in-all the burger was pretty tasty, but it really wasn't all that hot, considering the way they describe it. The fries were decent, but nothing crazy good, maybe a little cold. The server was just OK, but I wasn't expecting much. The server was friendly and actually recognized our Huntington Bank card from being in the Midwest, so we chatted a bit. I'd definitely come to Red Robin more often if there was one around me, because they do provide a decent meal at a fairly cheap price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-manchester?start=20,3.04,3.04,3.04,2.7,3.0400000000000005

It just so happen that the local Girl Scouts had a table setup immediately as you walked inside. I was immediately asked by them if I was interested in buying their cookies. I said no thank you, and a 2nd time, she asked me again??? I told her, look , we're here to celebrate my daughters birthday and not buy your cookies. How rude! To make matters worse, management allowed the Girl Scouts to put their table within 2' of where customers walk through their doors. Not on the side, which would've been a better alternative. My 7 yo, was crying at the time because her favorite video game was not there, and the last thing I needed was to be approaced immediately by the Girl Scouts. How about let the customer decide if we're interested. ???? Very poorly executed by Red Robin's Management Staff. So, that just set off a bad vibe and things got worse from there.  We sat down, our daughter noticed from the children's menu, for some odd reason , Red Robin stopped selling their famouse cheese quesidilla's. She was very upset about that too. She went with the pizza and thought it tasted disgusting. I tried some and agreed.  The best part was when the staff came over at the end of the meal to sing Happy Birthday and gave her a sundae! Which barely salvaged our dining experience.  On a side note, my burger came out fine, but my wife's salad was brought to our table without the chicken, because the waitress said it wasn't ready yet,so why bring it out? My wife was easting a plain old salad for about 5 min, until they brought out the chicken which was supposed to be the main part of the salad. Just a crazy day, and in the middle of the week with this many mistakes?? Oh, the line cooks , as I'm remembering, were unprofessional, laughing outloud and fooling around. We could even hear this from afar. At least our waitress was pretty good, though she brought out a half salad without the chicken.

But lately every time I go there it's lackluster in all of the areas mentioned before.  Staff is not attentive. Food comes out late. Kitchen gets back up often. Lack of organization amongst the staff and their seating assignments. Patrons that arrive after us get the exact same meals before us. Inconsistency of presentation...some tables get plates with their apps, some don't. Staff don't track burgers for rewards club even when asked.  I thought this may be a store specific issue but sadly I've witnessed many of these issues at a number of locations. Not sure what's happened to this food chain, but I will sadly not be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-manchester,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
9,Chris D.,"South Windsor, CT",183,168,271.0,4.0,2017-02-15,"Good place to go if you got kids. Burgers are pretty good and I dig their onion rings. All the burgers come with bottomless steak fries, but I upgraded to the onion rings for an extra $1. No brainer for me. Understand it's a chain and what the deal is here.  They really cater to families.  It's gonna be noisy and chaotic at times. If you can accept that going in,  you're gonna be fine. I actually like the burgers here.  Not great, but good in my opinion. The staff are usually pretty friendly and  accommodating and the restaurant has been renovated recently. Kids get a balloon too.

20,Jonathan G.,"Windsor, CT",41,24,3.0,4.0,2017-03-13,It's a bit pricey. Burgers start around $8 and go up from there. But that's pretty much standard for this type of restaurant. The service was good. Didn't have to wait too long. The environment is nice. The food is also well prepared.  The staff was very attentive.

19,Chin M.,"West Hartford, CT",0,9,,5.0,2017-03-27,"The kids dragged me out here tonight as we have not been to Red Robin since last year.  The Buckland Mall store has been refreshed and the changes are wonderful.  I think I subconsciously stopped going there because, although they have great burgers and salads, it always seemed loud to me.  That is not the case anymore, and this was with the restaurant absolutely full with a waiting list.  The new walls and screens are fantastic for cutting down the ambient noise, we actually talked as if we were at our dining room table.   First off, the service is great and the wait staff was not hurrying us but they were certainly on top of the next things that needed to be done at the table.  Their wings have always been on a par with Wooden Tap and J. Tim's and tonight was no exception.  For the first time ever, the kids actually finished a tower of onion rings (I need to understand they are getting bigger) and still had room for their burgers.   Our burgers were great.  I really appreciate the fact they have ""adult"" burgers, burgers that are creative and different and when I want really spicy they can deliver really spicy.  The kids were all happy with their choices and particularly like the real milkshakes they get.  We laughed at the fact that we never order dessert because we are always so full from fries and shakes.   One of the nicest things was I left a really good tip and the waitress walked right out the front door to thank us and wish us a good evening.  My thought is that Red Robin has made a substantial effort to tone down the noise and turn up the service and that really worked for us tonight.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-manchester,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56

23,Parlor Ghost ..,"New York, NY",82,4,3.0,2.0,2017-07-10,"My gf and I decided to try Red Robin's again after years of not going. I won't lie I had high hopes coming in today, seeing how this location was good when they originally opened..and they haven't closed since. We were sat quickly, not many people inside. Food came out pretty fast and drinks as well. Everything tasted ok at best. Nothing to rant and rave about. Atmosphere was kind of meh. The real reason why I am giving these guys 2 stars is because of the waiter we had. He decided while he waits on tables that he'd test out his comedy career and joke around like we were his friends. Don't get me wrong, we are really chill and down to earth but when it comes to restaurants, we just want someone quick and efficient who doesn't mess up our orders...not much to ask for right? The kicker is when he went to go and give me my card, he pretended like it got declined...then handed me the receipt to sign and said hahahaha just kidding. Obviously Red Robin is where you go to work if you're trying to become a clown. The whole experience turned us off to coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-manchester?start=20,2.52,3.11,3.11,,2.8739999999999997

About 20-25 minutes later we got my burger, her bowl of chili, a kids Mac and cheese and a kids corndog. Kids meals were cold, my burger which I asked for ""some pink"" was well done. Was told we would have a manager sent over. No such case. After eating what we could of our terrible food, (Kids ate the oranges) we got our bill. Charged for untouched kids meals.

2,Megan K.,"Rocky Hill, CT",297,391,1510.0,4.0,2017-11-19,"This Red Robin is a solid 4 establishment. Their fries are soooooo good with the fry flavoring and I can't recall anything I've never liked here. Normally I get the whiskey burger but yesterday I was more bold and tried the double taco seasoned burger and it was amazing, with a little kick thanks to the pepper jack cheese they put on it. My sweet potato fries needed to be cooked a little longer, but the mozz sticks were on point. I had their drink special, the orange cinn-a-rita, and omg it's like a delicious alcoholic sunny delight, I think that's the best comparison I can come up with for it. I highly recommend it. What really impressed me too is I went with my friend and her one year old little girl and my friend was worried about cleaning up under the baby's high chair and the waitress was super nice and said no no they'd take care of it. Which really spoke volumes, seeing as how most servers would complain about having to clean up after a little one.
