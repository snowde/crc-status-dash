The service went down, and the food left much to be desired.. The Avaocado was so runny it was more like a slurry with food coloring... my chicken was luke warm, and seemed to be made my Chef Mike (the microwave).. I also happened to see one guy in the kitchen who kept wiping his nose on his HANDS and NOT washing... I hope he was only loading dirty dishes into the dishwasher.......",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-marysville?start=80,2.472,2.472,2.472,2.472,2.472
78,Erin R.,"Everett, WA",114,197,72.0,2.0,2012-08-14,"We were hungry for dinner after our haircuts (see my Salon Chirella review and make an appointment with Sandra!) so stopped here for a quick bite to eat. Service: so slow.  We first asked to sit in the bar but when we noticed there weren't any booths we asked for a booth in the main dining room.  The hostess (nice enough) offered to bus the super large corner booth (big enough for about 6 people).  We told her we didn't really need that much space but she insisted... and then it took longer to get it cleaned then just sit in the main dining area.  Once we were seated, the server (again, nice enough) was not really attentive.  Rather than asking if we wanted more to drink (we did not), she deposited more drinks at our table.   Food:  okay.  It's easy to get distracted by the big ole burgers and bottomless fries but I was proud of myself for ordering a salad... albeit the Whiskey Chicken BBQ salad with all dressing and sauces on the side (I am projecting, but I bet it's a safe bet that they use way too much dressing).  The avocado on the side was perfectly fresh and delicious... the rest of the salad looked a little limp.  And of course, it's a HUGE portion size so barely ate half of it (and didn't bother taking the rest home). Red Robin is what it is.  Just wish there were some more options in that area, but I'm sure anything else that shows up will be chains chains and more chains.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-marysville?start=60,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44

68,Buzz W.,"Stanwood, WA",0,50,1.0,2.0,2013-02-13,"Probably the worst Red Robin I've been to, and have been going to them for 25 years since living in California.  My wife and I stopped here on a Friday night after a meeting as an impromptu ""date night"" activity.  It was around 9pm, and most of the younger families were gone and so not frantically busy.   I ordered a burger and my wife a salad.   A half hour went by, then 45 minutes.  I had to flag down several servers to find out where our food was... in the meantime people who'd arrived after we did were finishing eating.  When the food came, my burger had obviously spent the last 45 minutes under a heat lamp.  Took another 10 or so to get a waitress, who then had to check with another.  You get the picture.  They comped me the burger at least which is why this is not a one-star rating, but my wife's salad was very stale tasting as well. The place seems badly managed and in dire need of some quality control, and maybe they will get some, but in the meantime you can do a lot better locally than Red Robin.  I generally keep my reviews positive unless there is a real problem-- this place has one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-marysville?start=60,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003
70,Carrie H.,"Arlington, WA",71,248,80.0,2.0,2013-03-09,"I really like the Smokey Point Red Robin for their consistent food quality and fast, friendly service. However, a recent remodel leaves me reminiscing and missing the old Red Robin.  I miss the carousel horses, Robin statue, and neon ""Gourmet Burger Maker"" sign that represented a bit of history from 1943.  The remodel leaves this Red Robin very plain jane.  Bathrooms at this particular establishment need some attention. They aren't very tidy and well kept!   The stalls in the women's bathroom are VERY tiny - and I am a petite lady.  You can barely open the door without hitting the toilet and trying to close the door behind you when there is 4 inches between the toilet and the door's swing range is near impossible.   Bussing staff need to check facilities more frequently to empty trash cans and restock necessities like toilet paper, soap, and paper towels.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-marysville?start=60,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44

I ordered the bacon avocado burger on a lettuce bun with a side casear salad. I requested no onions and to change the cheese from swiss to pepper jack. On my side salad I asked for no croutons. After receiving my order I received a burger with onions and swiss cheese, and my salad had croutons. The burger was probably one of the worst that I have had in a while. Juices were flying out of this burger like crazy. Not to mention it took 10 minutes waiting for the waiter to ask us what we wanted to order.

79,Jim P.,"Lynnwood, WA",102,424,365.0,2.0,2013-09-22,Brought the grand kids ( 4 & 6) here for a quick lunch during the drive back to home. First visit to this I-5 location in Smokey Point. Seated promptly before noon and was given menus. Notice after being seated that nobody was receiving food yet so the kitchen was not keeping up with the lunch crowd. We received our food about 25 minutes after ordering. All was correct and tasted fine except for the cold fries! Red Robin has been on a small initial portion but bottomless fries kick and apparently precooks large batches. Definitely affects the quality served. I ordered my Burnin love burger slightly pink in order to enjoy a juicy patty. It was not overcooked like some past experience but still very dry. Perhaps frozen meat or pressed too often on the grill? When I grill a patty it is juicy. At $10.95 for a burger I expected better quality food. Spent $44.00 for lunch including soft drinks. Somethings not right here!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-marysville?start=60,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003
77,kayla a.,"Lynnwood, WA",0,27,3.0,1.0,2013-09-23,"Now all Red Robins are hit and miss as many restaurants are these days, it must be getting really hard to find quality staff these days. But no Red Robin is more miss than hit than this one.  Many times over the years at this location I've waited for long periods of time to be just to be served let alone have anyone come around to take my drink order. After the meal is severed by someone other than the waiter, I've been lucky to even see my waiter/waitress again before the bill arrives. If I get lucky enough that the server does come around again after the food is served, they take forever to fetch whatever it was that I politely requested. I've had countless meal orders messed up, and meals served warm and nowhere near hot or fresh.  My worst experience occurred last weekend when I order the seafood scatter. To start I ordered it without coleslaw it arrived with coleslaw with extra dressing covering it, and all my food was sitting in it. I should also mention it was cooler than room temperature. I stated to the waitress who did come around this time that I had order this without coleslaw and everything is covered in dressing from it, she said she would have it replaced.  A few minutes later the same meal was returned, the coleslaw had been rubbed out of the basket a few of the shrimp and clam strips had be rubbed clean of the dressing but one of the fish pieces was still covered in and soggy from it. The waitress came back around I held it up to her and said it's the same meal someone just tried cleaning it up, and while I was holding it up to her I saw a hair on it in the light. The manager came over and replaced my meal with one that was hot fresh, and cooked to perfection, much better than I've had in a long time, but it didn't really make up for the frustration. This is one location I will not be returning to, and I've already reduced my visits to RR a great deal due to the poor food and service at many of their locations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-marysville?start=60,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002,2.2760000000000002

105,Tamyra M.,"Bellevue, WA",10,2,,1.0,2013-12-20,"I have been going to Red Robin for 15-20 years now and have only had one other not so great experience. For the most part, it's ok. Some days/food items are better than others, but no one is perfect. Today's experience at the Marysville location was by far the worst. I went in to grab a burger and shake, while the contractor worked on tile at my retail space in the area. Big mistake. Would have been better off at McDonald's (which should say a lot). From the minute I walked in, the service was sketchy. The gals at the hostess stand were cleaning off menus and turned to say hello to me, but didn't actually stop working, as if they really wanted to help me. I said I'd called in a carry out order, so they pointed me to the bar. I went to the bar and stood in the bar, next to the only terminal in the bar for nearly 10 minutes, before one of the servers from in back passed and asked if I'd been helped. I told her I'd called in a to go order and she turns, looks over my shoulder, to the bartender, that I hadn't noticed before, sitting in the booth with guests behind me, just chatting it up. She walks me to the other end of the bar and tells me someone will be with me momentarily.  The bartender then gets up, comes over to me, and as she passes me, I hear someone tell her 'carry out order on line 1' (she didn't pick up the line until I was walking out of the restaurant nearly 6-7 min later). She doesn't respond to them, but asks me if I'm picking up an order. I say yes, she asks the name, and takes my card for payment. I tell her before she swipes it, I'd like to add a strawberry shake to the order. She says ok, adds the shake, swipes my card, then leaves it face side up on the counter, as she goes down to make the shake. She scoops out 2 scoops of strawberry mix, then starts to pour milk in the cup she's going to make the shake in. She must see something in the cup that shouldn't be, though because first she starts to stick her hand in and grab it, then she decides against this, pouring out the contents of the cup, wiping off the shake machine with her hand, and starting over (with the same cup). She then scoops two more scoops of strawberry, opens the milk and sniffs it, then pours a little less than the previous time into the cup, fills the cup with ice cream, and mixes away. When my food comes out, I leave, only to open the box in the car and find out they're old, cold fries.  I called in a to go order, was told that it would take 20 minutes. I arrived in less than 10 minutes, waited at the bar for nearly 15 minutes, and then left with cold food? Oh - it gets worse. I turn my car around, go back and park, take my bag inside, and tell the gal I'm sorry to be a pain, but can I please get fresh fries. SHe says oh sure. Sorry about that. We do serve those here. She comes back with a small, white styrofoam box of fries, and off I go. I get in the car, open up the new fries, and realize - yup - you guessed it - same batch of fries. Old, cold fries...  I'm not going in a third time. I figure I'll eat the burger, drink the shake, and call it good. The contractor calls to say he's done, so I rush out of the lot to go inspect his work before locking up for the day. As I'm leaving the lot, I take a nice, long sip  of my shake, only to feel something hard in my mouth. I swallow most of the liquid, then getting on the freeway, pull out what appears to be a brownish/black glob of something very hard but that smears onto the envelope I find on the passenger seat to put it on. Yuck!!! NO idea what that was, but it obviously ruined the shake.  So, now we're down from fries and a shake and burger to just the burger. I get back to my space, toss the fries, toss the shake, keep the burger. Inspect my contractor's work, then sit down to eat my burger and finish up email before going home. I unwrap it - and the patty is burned so badly on this thing, I cannot eat it as it is, so I pull the edges off all the way around (that are burned to a crisp - I mean black burned not just a little on the done side), try eating the middle, but the strips from the grill on this thing are as black as the outside. I ended up pulling the pineapple off and just eating the pineapple and tomatoes from my bonzai burger. I thought of calling in to speak with the manager, but figured you know what - in today's day and age - there's just no excuse for that. One mistake I can let slide... Two possibly. Terrible service, cold food, AND burned food in one transaction? That just screams we don't care all day long.  Take your money elsewhere. Had there been the option of negative stars here, I would have used it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-marysville?start=80,2.02,2.02,2.02,2.02,2.02

Mine was the wrong burger altogether, but I ate it anyway as we were in a bit of a rush and I couldn't wait. And the broccoli was cold. I mean not even lukewarm.  We had finished the burgers by the time the server returned, and when we told her about the cold broccoli, her response was, ""well, I can get you more, because you can have unlimited refills."". Uh, yeah, or, you could just replace my broccoli since I haven't eaten it.  Needless to say, we didn't wait for our replacement veggies and were ever-so-generously given a 10% discount on our overpriced burgers. So for $23, we each had a burger, no sides, and one soda.

45,Maggie A.,"Snohomish, WA",15,42,221.0,2.0,2014-10-17,"I visited the Smokey Point Red Robin with my party of nine to celebrate my son's 8th birthday.  As a part of the Red Robin Royalty Club, my son had a free birthday meal, and he really wanted to go to Red Robin on his special day.   We have noticed a significant decline in the quality of Red Robin's food over the last couple of years.  It is apparent that the company is trying to cut costs by making serving sizes smaller.  I observed that the kids' menus no longer come with crayons and pages to color, but rather in standard laminated form.   The options for vegetarians are very limited, and the options for vegans are even more limited.  I follow a vegan diet and ordered the hummus plate tonight.  Last time, I ordered the hummus plate, and had so much hummus that I brought some home.  This time, the quantity of hummus had greatly decreased and was not enough to put a little on every bite of food on the hummus plate.  The only other menu items I can eat are the black beans, steamed broccoli, Boca burger, and fries.  Red Robin does have a ""designated fryer"" for cooking food for people with food allergies, and vegans.   Tonight, all of our our food arrived lukewarm.    Our server changed halfway through our meal, and the second server had not been informed of our dietary restrictions.  The first server was friendly but confused by our dietary and split check requests.  The second server was not friendly, and after she took over, we saw the first server bussing tables.  It was quite strange.  The best service we got came from someone I took to be a manager, who came our table to clarify our special dietary requests.  Our meals were served with no utensils, and no beverage refills were offered.  As we left, our server did not even look at us, and the hostess did not acknowledge us either.   Red Robin checks used to be delivered to customers with comment cards, but there was no way for us to comment on our dining experience this evening.  The absence of comment cards gives the impression that they don't really care if customers are unhappy.   I do not expect that we will return to Red Robin...unless our kids beg us to go for their next birthdays.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-marysville?start=40,2.76,2.76,2.76,1.608,2.76

It seems like the servers disappear and really take their time about refilling your drinks. There was a time when we came to this RR and the service was quick and very good.

99,Natasha V.,"Arlington, WA",13,42,10.0,2.0,2014-11-21,"Every time I come here I like to get the soup and salad combo with clam chowder because the chowder is normally great. When my best friend and I went there for dinner our pretzel bites were over cooked, our spinach artichoke dip had no artichokes, and my chowder was disgusting. The bowl was coated in coagulation chowder and the soup itself was super runny and not like the chowder I've always gotten. It was like the poured the bowl of soup it sat too long so they poured it out and put more and even that was luke warm. Was it the bottom of the batch of something?  It was like the cooks didn't even care. I couldn't make myself eat more than a spoonful it was just so disappointing and the waitress asked if I wanted a different soup, but none of the other soups sounded remotely appealing and I just told her I was full enough from the 2 appetizers my friend and I shared and my salad so she took the price of the soup off. When we left I looked at the kitchen to see 4 cooks that looked like dive bar line cooks and it made sense that they probably did not care what so ever about the quality of the food going out. I've been a server and I can't even understand how she could look at the bowl and think that it is acceptable to have even served me the nasty bowl of soup, I would not have served that. I get that it's a chain restaurant but really?!  It wasn't even busy and it was earlier evening. Disappointing. Went here again last week despite my last experience because my boyfriend wanted to go. I himmed and hawwed if I wanted to try again for the clam chowder salad and decided I'd give it a shot. This time the chowder was in a different type of bowl, flatter and wider instead of the little tiny bowl I got last time with the little handle. The chowder was like the chowder I've gotten before unlike the one they served me the last time I was in so that was good. However, my soup was barely even Luke warm... as I'm eating my soup and salad I notice the millions of greasy fingerprints all over the rim of both bowls. I mean every square inch of the rims were covered in multiple layers of fingerprints. How many people touched my dishes and how many didn't wash their freaking hands?! I was so hungry I finished my soup and salad all the while praying I didn't get food poisoning from someone not washing their greasy hands and then touching my bowls of food. Terrifying. Minor discrepancies; I didn't get a fork for my salad and had to ask, I actually got the garlic bread with my chowder this time but it was only 1 rock hard piece that was inedible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-marysville?start=80,2.8,2.8,2.8,1.6720000000000002,2.8

Were brought regular fries instead of sweet potato.  Thanks buddy. At least they were hot this time.  I had a side salad and California chicken sandwich.  My salad was ice cold and crispy.. literally the only good thing about the visit.  Sandwich was room temp with a soggy bottom bun and hard top bun.   We were finally brought a check which took  10 minutes to pick up and did not bring back an itemized receipt with a feed back number.

Many times I will have an empty glass sitting on the table for 10-15 minutes, need more fries or ranch dressing, or just need some sweetener or napkins, only to be ignored by the wait staff.

They were also missing egg, which was replaced with cucumber without our knowledge.  My coworker received two halves of wilted romaine with greasy bacon bunched up and NO chicken (this is apparently the insane romain).

The time between when we sat down and ordered drinks was about standard.  Once we ordered we waited about 35+ minutes for our food to come out.  The kids spaghetti plate, which we ordered the big size of, came out and was pathetically small. We complained and they brought a 2nd small portion (see pictures).  Seriously, this is pasta we're talking about here, the old kid's portion seemed larger. About half way through eating we ordered a 2nd basket of fries, and asked for them crispy.  They came out promptly and were so crispy they were burned.   The final insult was when the check came.  There was a 1.99 entertainment fee?! I assume it came from the stupid entertainment tablet on the table when the kids were looking at it.  We complained about the fee, at least warn us when we sit down that there's pay to play games.  The waiter to make things right, offered up $5 from ""his own wallet"".  We refused the money, what we wanted was for him to remove the charge.  So, he took his money back.  When we got the final check with the receipt to sign, it turned out that there was a 1.99 cash payment to offset the charge.  I get he was trying to make it right, but after we refused his money this was the wrong way to make it right.

It's pretty decent but it seems that no matter which location I go to, they always forget some of the ingredients on the burgers. If it says something comes on your sandwich on the menu it doesn't necessarily mean it makes it there. They are always nice about getting what was missing and or taking a couple of bucks off the bill. That's nice, but I wish they would just get it right the first time to begin with.  My other gripe is the price. Damn! When did the food get smaller and the price go up?! Ok so I will still go there, but more begrudgingly. Who can complain about bottomless fries though? Those always win you over and drag you back in for more. They do make really killer shakes too. I don't seek out RR but it's not a terrible option either.

I've never had to wait that long even on a busy night.  I gave the waitress an opportunity to make it right and nothing.  I can't feed a six year old air.  So disappointed that I can expect better service at the drive thru window at McDonald's than at Red Robin - boo!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-marysville?start=40,1.96,1.96,1.96,1.6360000000000001,1.96

Another 30 minutes later....we got our food.  Our server wasn't very attentive. The whole experience wasn't fun and we were there longer than we wanted too.

Efficient service and the bar area seating is better spaced then the main dining area.   While the booths in the main area are comfortable, unfortunately the middle sections, table areas, are incredibly cramped.   The seating is too close,  causing elbows to hit your head and need to scoot in order to allow others by.   Food and beverage are typical Red Robin; all locations are the same.   Plenty of reliable selections. That said when properly cooked the fries are scrumptious, however more times than not they've been overcooked recently.  The wait time for food the last two times has been exceptionally long.   The buns were burnt the last time we were there.  How could that not be noticed?  We had waited so long for our food perhaps the kitchen was taking extra time to burn it? The alcoholic beverages are on the weak side, making it an expensive option consideration of what you receive.   Yet typical for chain type restaurant.  That started they're flavorful, great tasting.   Nonalcoholic freckled lemonade, with free refills, are a refreshing good choice.   The shakes are thick and delicious.

The problems were that the food was horrible, my burger seemed like it had been sitting out for like 10 minutes and my sons food was cold and stiff. My second complaint was with the fact that our server had to go on break, which I understand, but they made us pay our bill with out asking if we wanted anything because she couldn't clock out with an open bill and once she left we were there for about 15 to 20 minutes longer and no one came to ask if we needed anything or to check on us. Once we got up no one seemed to notice and all the plates and cups were still on the table, so what I'm trying to say is that they never came to pick up anything once our server left.

I had to make a yelp account just to comment on how terrible my experience here was. The waitress (don't remember her name cause she never introduced herself and was gone for like 70% of the time we were there) came to initially greet us kind of late---we usually take time to look over the menu so it actually wasn't too bad, so didn't mind this. Waitress took our drink orders, offered to activate our ziosk, and took our food orders. I specified no tomatoes on my burger, cause hey I'm not a big fan. And I asked for a side of ranch to come with our appetizer. Waitress came with our drinks pretty much disappeared after that. Appetizer comes, and no ranch. Slight oversight probably, and it was actually good without it so whatever, I dealt with it. Food comes, dropped off by another staff member. Looks great! Oh wait, tomato on the burger. Man well that's disappointing, but oh well I pick it off and continue with the meal. Still no sign of waitress.  We are all more than halfway through the meal, still no waitress, mom is wondering if we get refill on fries. I thought well normally they'd check on us by now, see how we're doing, so it's strange that nobody has stopped by. Maybe I'll hit the ziosk ""call server"" button. It does its flashy red light show, as every employee in the building BUT our waitress walks by it, looks at it, and keeps walking. After at least 15 minutes of this, my mom finally had to yell at someone to get their attention just to get fry refills, which takes a second to do. And sure enough, as soon as we light the fire under the employees, suddenly the waitress shows up. Everyone is suddenly checking up on us every minute, offering drink refills, more fry refills--way too late to fix this guys. Some impression Red Robin made on her, they didn't even send a manager our way when clearly we were unhappy and disappointed with the staff.  What was supposed to be a nice lunch with the family (and this was my first time my mom had eaten here to top it off) turned out to be a disaster.  This isn't the first time Red Robin has let me down, but man they have a lot of improving to do before we consider going back---at least to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-marysville?start=60,2.04,2.04,2.04,1.7000000000000002,2.04
7,Grant S.,"Everett, WA",0,3,,5.0,2016-06-30,"I used to be a manager for RR, and worked with them for 19 years. You might think I'm positive biased, but you'd be wrong. I notice the mistakes easily, since everything else is how it should be. I can also say that I wasn't recognized since this wasn't one of my locations or familiar staff. That said: Great visit!! I came in at 3pm, so a slower time, but also when a small mistake is more obvious. A friendly host greeted me at the door and when I opted to sit in the bar, she wished me a great lunch. Anthony, the cocktailer, greeted me within a couple minutes with a menu and silverware on a little tray. Rather than detailing every little thing, I think a flurry of adjectives would do. They were prompt, courteous, efficient, and attentive to any needs. The food was correct, meaning it was timely, cold was cold, and hot was hot. Also, my burgers build was correct and it had PPPP (picture perfect plate presentation). It was cooked correctly and was truly delicious. Even the other superlatives were on point. The restaurant was clean, the music was at an appropriate level, and there was a general positive vibe.  As a past manager, I would say that this is a really good example of the Red Robin experience.  Now, something I've always wanted to say.  To all the folks who write reviews behind a keyboard, and don't have the ability to talk to a manager. To all those who write ""worst ______ ever"" (really?). To those who never asked for more fries, then are surprised they didn't get a refill (duh, RR will waste food and keep you table full??). To those that don't realize this place is kid friendly. To those that don't realize that evenings are busy, Friday and Saturday is busy, after the local soccer game is busy, etc. Get over it! Have some awareness of where you are, and what's expected of yourself. The average employee age is 20-22, so set your expectations accordingly.

9,Marcel H.,"Arlington, WA",0,4,,1.0,2016-07-13,"By far the worst location for Red Robin my family has ever been to. Every time we have come in there have been MAJOR problems that require a manager to get involved. The wait staff are generally inattentive or downright rude, and food tends to come out of the kitchen stone cold.  Another issue is that we have 2 members of the family with severe gluten allergies. The menu lends itself well to eating gluten free with gluten free buns, or no bun, and (supposedly) a separate frier for french fries. But when you express the needs based on an ALLERGY and you get baskets of fries with battered onion rings and other breaded bits of food in the bottom, it's obvious the staff couldn't care less about cross contamination or safety of guests.  In addition getting fry refills can take as long as 20-30 minutes and most of the time requests are completely ignored by wait staff. Service and food delivery is painfully slow, as our last visit it took 20 minutes to get drinks, another 20 for the server to come back after that ( drinks delivered by what appeared to be a bus boy), another 20 minutes for appetizers, and then ANOTHER 30 minutes for meals, which were delivered cold and soggy, with like MAYBE 10 sweet potato fries on each plate, all burnt to a crisp. Asking for more fries took another 25 minutes, at which time a 1/4 basket showed up, also cold, and with bits of onion rings all over the place. By this time we are just fed up and decided to leave and haven't been back since after talking to a manager who could not have been less interested in the issues.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-marysville?start=20,2.16,2.16,2.16,1.604,2.16

If you ask for a side of fries they will charge you for it so I ask for a fry fill since you get unlimited fries with your meal.

Sad to say, not much has changed let alone been improved. The husband and I decided to hit up RR because we were in the mood for burgers and glancing over the menu online, the Poutine caught our attention. The descriptions of the burgers also helped seal the deal. We were greeted and seated by a very friendly young lady, then our server, another friendly young lady, showed up within minutes. We ordered our drinks and an appetizer, which were received in a timely manner. The Poutine was damn tasty. We then ordered our burgers, both from the tavern menu. Hubs ordered the Turbo Q and I the Ghost Pepper and substituted onion rings. My burger was alright, nothing stellar. The fresh jalapeños were fresh and crisp and the fried ones weren't soggy, but the burger lacked the heat I was anticipating. The onion rings were too greasy and the breading just flaked off. It made me a little sad. Everything tasted alright all in all. Hubs wasn't impressed with his burger. It all came down to the bun. He liked it well enough, but had he known it was going to be a plain Jane sesame seed bun, he'd have requested a lettuce wrap instead. A different bun would have helped my burger as well. The restaurant was very clean and the staff was very friendly. Only real complaint is the temperature of the restaurant steadily increased to an uncomfortable level before finally cooling off as we were leaving.

Walk in and it's packed the front host just waved me over to the bar when I said I had a to go order. The mozzarella sticks were good. Crispy chicken burger was the worst burger Ive had.

She tried sitting me next to the bussing station I told her that would not work ""Too noisy"" She said that was understandable. I was seated at a two top table.

I went on to tell her that I would be dinning alone that I know that most all restaurants don't like single seating customers and that I tip well. Just don't forget about me or my order. Well guess what? She forgot about me. After making my order I sat for what was over thirty minutes with no one refilling my water or asking me anything. The people sitting across from me even noticed that I was forgotten. I stopped a young girl and asked her to send the manager over. She asked if there was something that she could do. I said yes you could get the manager. I watched her walk over and start talking to a young man and then go back by the kitchen. About two minutes later a women and the young man came to my table. The young man asked what it was that I need to see the manager for? I asked Are you the manager? he replied no. The young lady asked me if there was a problem. I asked her are you the manager she said that the manager wasn't available and that I could talk to her. I told her that I have ordered and had not seen my server sense.                               She informed me that my server has left and my order was never put in. She said she was sorry and very embarrassed that something like that would happen. She then asked me what I had ordered. She then said that she would have the cooks make my order ASAP and I would not be charged. That would be fine I told her. About ten minutes later another young girl brings out my order. Well not only was it wrong it was cold. I then got up and started to walk towards the door the young girl at the door said thank you and said come back soon. I smiled and said thank you. Some one must have noticed that the food was untouched and I was leaving. The manager then came out as I was walking out the door and asked if there was anything I could help me with. I just smiled and said good day. One too many chances, No more. we're done.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-marysville?start=60,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92

Our server, Christine, is a great ambassador to this business. It's crowded and busy and the vibe of this place is good.

33,Howard I.,"Arlington, WA",0,8,,1.0,2017-04-18,Went there on a weekday evening. My wife and I wanted to the dinner and a movie thing lime we used to when we were dating.  Sounded great to us! But it wasn't to be so great. The service was mediocre and the food took a long time. It wasn't even hot when we got it. It tasted O K but certainly not good or great. The sad part is they weren't even busy. RR has gone downhill.  WAY downhill. I used to really love going to RR but  now I would much rather go to the junkyard grill or blazing onion.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-marysville,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0
31,Rick N.,"Lake Stevens, WA",0,4,,1.0,2017-05-20,"I don't know what it is about this particular location, but we will not be back. Every single time, there's an issue.  On multiple occasions, we've been sat and forgotten. Each time, a server from halfway across the restaurant (the same guy twice, ironically) has come over and said that we looked like we'd been forgotten, we weren't in his section but he'd take care of us.  Service from the kitchen is always slow.  Last night, in what was our final visit to this location, it took forever to be acknowledged after being sat. When our food finally arrived, my Ensenada Chicken Platter arrived cold (not cool, cold) and hard. Think ""hockey puck chicken"". Every other location seems to be able to get this correct; this location can't seem to get very much correct.  I worked for many years in the restaurant industry, and I feel I'm extra lenient when it comes to slow service or order mistakes. The issues in this location aren't a result of being constantly slammed; they're a result of mismanagement. Take your business elsewhere.

Finally we were swatted after  45 minutes because more wait staff came in. It is father day and they should have staffed accordingly.  We ordered our food. About 10 min later the fries came..and came..still No drinks. Then the food came and the buns Were stale. Not too happy with our visit. Appeared not to be very clean, silver ware on the floor under our table, the ketchup bottles are sticky, the menus are sticky and  dirty.  Very disappointed with our visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-marysville,1.84,2.3,2.3,,2.116

However they lost a customer because of how SLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW the service was... I mean our server was nice and all but the food took 40 mins to arrive and the place wasn't even half full. By looking at other comments they definitely work on customer skill and hiring more employees.... it's too bad because the food is really good!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-marysville,1.96,2.3,2.3,,2.1639999999999997

We came in on a Tuesday night. Our server took forever to take our order and just could not follow up fast enough for our liking.  My wife had an empty water glass for a solid 10 minutes. I had to get up and grab my own mustard. I understand that good help is hard to come by these days.  At least the manager could have come around and checked in on us since the place was not busy. With all the other places around Arlington, we are tired of the bad service and will be dining elsewhere.

I ordered a black and blue burger...rare, because I like it pink. The burger brought to me was burnt on the edges and more than well done...no mooing at all. I called the waitress over and she said she would talk to her manager....45 minutes later....still no manager. The waitress came back...I told her she needed to order me a new burger that was cooked right and that I had been waiting long enough. Also, the Bloody Mary I ordered tasted like it didn't have any alcohol in it. I mentioned it to my waitress, who assured me the second one would have more alcohol...it, unfortunately, was less strong than the first, which I did not think was possible.

Duh.....  Also, we both ordered bloody marys which did not taste like they had alcohol in it.  When this was pointed out, she again made up an excuse stating "" i watched the bartender put in the shots"".  Clearly this server and manager know nothing about customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-marysville,1.84,2.18,2.18,,2.044

This location had incredible service, especially considering that we ate during the lunchtime rush. Service: The three of us were seated immediately and given menus. Our server came by to get our menus and he was both friendly and professional. We placed our orders for a stack of towering onion rings and burgers, and received them shortly after. They were quick with our food and would come back often to see if we wanted refills on our sides. Food: The onion rings are delicious. Always a fan-favourite. We ended up getting the bonsai burger, the bleu burger, and the sriracha double tavern with sides of fries and a side salad. We were very happy with our burgers and I appreciated that you could swap out the bottomless fries for a bottomless side salad. Ambiance/Cleanliness: No problems whatsoever. It's a clean establishment with the diner feel.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-marysville,1.96,2.2,2.2,,2.104
