48,Elizabeth V.,"Mason, OH",0,2,,2.0,2012-03-06,"Went to Red Robin this evening because we had an email about the free Oreo shake in honor or the Oreo's birthday!  It's disappointing to say that the service  tonight was not up to par.  I ordered the California Chicken Sandwich with a side of Mac and Cheese.  After a long wait, my sandwich was cold.  The chicken was colder than the Guacamole and the Provolone cheese was stiff like cardboard.  On the flip side, the mac and cheese cup was blazing hot and good.   When the Manager came to apologize, she asked if there was anything else we needed, my five year old son asked for additional oranges.  She said okay and NEVER came back!  I, mentioned it the our waiter and instead of getting what my son wanted, we got our bill.   Very disappointed for the Manager on duty and her wait staff as I had to explain to my child that they did not want to give him anymore oranges. The shake was Meh, okay.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mason?start=40,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003,2.8560000000000003
38,Martin D.,"Plainfield, IL",0,31,4.0,4.0,2012-03-23,"This is a full service burger joint (i.e. you are waited on).  Their specialty is ""gourmet"" burgers, which they do well. We went here last night. I had a Royal Red Robin Burger. I love this burger.  It is different as it comes with a fried egg on it along with bacon, cheese, lettuce, onion, and tomato (minus tomato for me).  A fried egg may seem odd, but it is actually quite excellent.  While me and the family like Red Robin, I try not to go to often as it would not be a good healthy choice to have especially with bottomless fries.  In truth the burger is big enough that I don 't eat the fries. The kids love the bottomless freckled lemonade   Its a good thing these are ""bottomless"" because they can go through several glasses no problem. Sodas and fries are bottomless as well.  The atmosphere is definitely casual and fairly noisy when they are busy.  They, also, have several TV's in the bar and the restaurant area showing whatever the current sporting event is (we watched NCAA Tournament Ohio State/ UC game while we ate our dinner).  As others have said service can be hit or miss.  It was good last night. Generally it is not the fastest either, so don't go here if you are pressed for time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mason?start=20,3.024,3.024,3.024,3.024,3.024

I'm usually not a huge fan of chains, but Red Robin does burgers well. I'm especially fond of the Royal Red Robin burger. The bottomless fries are also a nice touch, so I can get even fatter! They also have sweet potato fries and garlic fries.  Pro Tip- Don't forget to get some sauces for your fries. They have a Thai Chili, and my personal favorite, campfire sauce. These are great for dipping your fries in.  As far as ambiance, the only annoying thing is people bring their kids here for birthdays like crazy. So he prepared to hear happy birthday with clapping a few times if they are packed. There's a nice outdoor seating area for when the weather is nice.

My nephew got a Smoke & Pepper Burger and he seemed to enjoy it. Not sure if bottomless fried came with our meals, but one serving was enough. The fries were good but I like my fries crisp with a little crunch, these were a large cut somewhat limp, no crunch. Our server was not very attentive, but he seemed to be covering a lot of tables while other servers watched.

In the past, service has been pretty hit or miss, with some servers being totally on the ball and some presenting a total suck-fest. Last night our server was cute, funny and pretty efficient. A tad slow on refills, but you know the story with me on those by now anyway - probably would have been more than sufficient for a normal person. Her recommendation of the Burnin' Love burger for the lovely beau turned out to be right on - it was hot, spicy, jalapeno-y goodness (p.s. I ate his scraps). The atmosphere is another story, as they're definitely sporting a weird Applebee's-in-the-90s meets Chuck E Cheese vibe. The place sorely needs an update, especially since ""gourmet burgers"" are their claim to fame. The burgers are kick-ass for sure, but the decor is a tacky enamel junk fest.

Assistant Manager and waiter told me the card had not been activated a month in advance, so I could come back in a month maybe? Harrumph. Then, to the food.... My fries this visit are cold, oily and burned.  The ""medium"" burger I got was pink throughout... assistant manager wearing glasses blamed our brilliant waiter James and said he should have explained the two levels of medium. Apparently the ""fully brown medium"" my mom ordered was somehow different than the ""bloody pink medium"" one I got... and we both ordered the burgers cooked exactly the same way. Medium.  This assistant manager even offered to go in the back and print out the ""standards"" of medium so I could see that there are two distinct levels of ""medium"" and therefore, the kitchen did not screw up. Not good. Later in the meal... Real manager came by to apologize for the re-make of my burger (I grew up in So. CA with salmonella Jack in the Box burgers, so I will not eat any burger with bright pink meat in it), he said Red Robin really does NOT  have two different categories of ""medium""  and he was aghast (1) that we were told there were two different categories of medium, and (2) both of our burgers (ordered medium ) came out looking so radically different. They gave me my burger for free, gave me a birthday sundae in a ""go cup"" and invited me to come back as soon as tomorrow for my free birthday burger and another free birthday sundae.

I ordered the Whiskey River Burger, one of my personal favorites. I'd recommend that to anyone. The BBQ sauce is tangy and sweet, and the onions on it create a nice balance between the salty and sweet flavors. Fries are good - I can never finish a second order, even when my kids help.  The service has always been great, and this time was no different.

To top it off, they have these tabletop electronic kiosks where they'd like you to place your order and pay your bill instead of bothering your waitstaff - it gets in the way on a four top covered in dishes, it seems to foster lackluster service and while we were successful in paying our bill on it, it is difficult to read, bulky to handle and printed out a blank receipt.

It would be great to see them do a from scratch veggie burger rather than using Boca, that is my only criticism, basically I think it sells Red Robin a bit short to offer all those mouthwatering burgers for the carnivores and not something in kind for the vegetarians.  Maybe in the future though...

However we consistently have to wait for our food to take 25 minutes to reach our table. Maybe there are just too many tables in the restaurant and the kitchen just can't get it done. The answer is if you've got the time to wait for your food, it good when it gets there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mason,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006
3,Paul K.,"Cincinnati, OH",3,42,27.0,4.0,2017-02-06,"I've been to this location before but was a bit disappointed, I found the one in the Kenwood Mall to be better. However, that being said, tonight they redeemed themselves! The service was great, we were seated quickly and our food came out in short time. Red Robin makes a tasty burger, so this satisfies my burger craving! A nice extra is their fries and lemonades are bottomless. We had the sweet potato fries and really enjoyed them as well. Overall, despite previous disappointments at this location, I will go back hoping that was just an off day for them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mason,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006

9,Brad C.,"South Lebanon, OH",0,11,,1.0,2017-06-06,"We've been going to Red Robin for years but this this last visit was rough. Walking into the restaurant the sidewalk was covered in duck waste. As you got within twenty feet of the door there was some attempt to clean it up so they were aware, just didn't want to clean all of it. Once we sat down in the bar area we waited a very long time to be waited on the food the check everything!!  No management in sight the waiter was stretched way to thin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mason,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84

16,Tom Z.,"West Chester Township, OH",16,38,1.0,2.0,2017-08-01,"Typically my experience at red robin is 4 stars. Today, I left very disappointed. I ordered the southern charm burger. I was asked how I wanted it prepared and I said please on the pink side. Normally, it's not a problem for red robin to serve up a perfectly cooked burger at any location. I've never been let down. My burger came out w/ no pink at all. Pressing down on it I found it wasn't even moist. Mgr was friendly and said we'll make you another one. Next burger came out the exact same way!! No pink at all! You would think that the 2nd burger would have been checked before going out to the table. I said I have to get back to work, and can't wait on a 3rd try. I wasn't charged anything including my beer. Happy I didnt have to pay for the beer, but Mgr never came back out to apologize. Waitress said you are good, meaning I didn't have to pay for anything. So I left. I will still go to red robin, but not this location off Bowen Dr.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mason,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72

0,Cindy W.,"Cincinnati, OH",221,116,610.0,4.0,2017-10-12,"UPDATE AS OF OCTOBER 2017: I'm changing my rating back to 4 stars. Management has changed, as well as several staff members at this location. It seems as if the rules have changed with having bottomless fries and salad to come out before the meal. I have been back a few times after writing my original review, and I have been given fries and or salad before the meal arrived without a fight. This is a major positive impact, as their menu calls out their 'claim to fame' with bottomless fries and salad. I'm glad they have welcomed this feature back. Since my retina review, they have also provided a digital way to check out. This mini computer allows you to ask for refills, call your server, as well as check for your royalty points. You can even pay your bill, as well as play games on this miniature iPad.  I am a huge fan of their 'buy 10 burgers get one free' option. This is a positive bonus that makes me want to return to this restaurant, as the burger choices are endless. I feel like they have added a new burger each time I have visited.  Thank you to staying true to your motto of bottomless fries! I'm super glad this has been welcomed back into the routine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mason,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8

1,Matthew C.,"Cincinnati, OH",1,163,2.0,3.0,2017-11-24,"My kids love Red Robin! My oldest likes meatballs on a stick while my youngest likes that she can get pizza and French fries. While I do like the fries, I made the mistake of ordering a wrap at a burger place. I am still looking for the chicken that was supposed to be in the wrap. I have not found it. I do find it irritating that they offer kids the use of an entertainment device and then put an entertainment charge on the bill without asking you about it. While the kids love it, it feels like they are just pumping up the bill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mason,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84
