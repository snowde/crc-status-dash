80,Megan S.,"Pasco, WA",18,327,37.0,1.0,2012-02-19,"Worst service ever. Our waitress literally only took our order and brought us our check. The hostess took our drink order, brought the drinks, brought the food, and refilled the drinks that sat empty for an extended period of time. Our ""waitress"" stopped by once to check on us in between. She was socially retarded and made rude comments to my husband like ""Are you okay? You don't look so good""...uh...he's been driving for 7 hours, thanks for the insult. And taking forever.  Ceasar wrap had no ceasar dressing on it. Fries were overcooked. Salad was disappointing also...foccocia was floury, hard, and not as well seasoned as I've had it at other Red Robins. Cheese on the salad was dried out. Tomatoes in the salad were mushy and warm. Chicken on salad was super greasy (Think KFC).  Waited forever for the check. Would have paid cash had we not wanted credit on our Red Robin Royalty Card. However, when she ran the card, we noticed she had not done our Royalty Card, so we didn't even get credit for the two entrees we bought. The receipt always says how many entrees you have toward your free one; our receipt had no mention. Now that really chapped my ass. And not in a good way, either.

86,Eric P.,"Kissimmee, Orlando, FL",61,263,6.0,4.0,2012-08-25,"Perhaps I'm reviewing this chain through fond-memory glasses. When I was in college, Red Robin was one of our go-to places ... and they haven't found their way to Orlando (yet). But when visiting the fam in Southern Oregon, I tend to steer us this way. There are a ton of unusual burger options, as well as some great salads and wraps. For me, put avocado or guac on it and I'm probably going to order it. And maybe a refill or two of their bottomless steak fries. And lest I forget why it was a college go-to place, they have some fun, alcoholic milkshakes. (And, oh yeah, regular ones, too.) So yes, pretty average location for this chain, but wrapped in lots of nostalgia for me, so I still opt there, even when I'm trying to stick to non-chain, local fare. If that doesn't say ""fan,"" I don't know what does.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-medford?start=80,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997
94,Lux L.,"Portland, OR",13,29,,2.0,2012-08-28,"Ok. Let's begin by saying: I'm not a fan of chains. When I was younger, I LOVED going to Red Robin for the milkshakes and the endless fries. But this was before I understood the ramifications of where you put your money. I'm not going to launch into some political rant here, don't worry. But I will say that I am much happier giving my money and my business to a locally-owned, family restaurant than I am a major chain with 5,000 restaurants nationwide. Chances are, they don't need the cash from me. Furthermore, what scares me a little bit about chains is that they have this menu that every single restaurant adheres to. There are no gourmet chefs in the kitchen, or even a mom-and-pop style cook who has labored over his or her recipes for years to perfect them. This rings true for me every time I have been to Red Robin as an adult: the food is average to poor, the service is mediocre, and the atmosphere is cookie-cutter.  But I think the thing that bothers me the most about this place is that they use non-recyclable, plastic dixie cups for EVERY SINGLE dip, dressing, and condiment. Want more ranch dressing for your fries? Generate 4 more dixie cups of waste. If this is true for every Red Robin in the US, think about how much waste is being generated every day, just by those red plastic dixie cups.  Well, now that I've sounded like a hippy though this whole post, I'm gonna go hug some trees or something.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-medford?start=80,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003,2.3440000000000003
93,Bob N.,"Medford, OR",41,2,,1.0,2012-09-07,"Hey there Medford Red Robin!!! Let me tell you why I will never return to your location. Let's start it off with a 2-minute wait at the front door, a manager suggesting a 6 top sit at the bar when he finally came out. Hmm.. Okay. We sat down in the lower section by the drink station. Our server didn't come to the table for 10 minutes because ""she wasn't told she got a table sat"". Um. Shouldn't you keep an eye on your section to begin with? Our drinks took over 5 mins, because for some reason she had to go to another drink station besides the one we were literally right next to? Two in our party ordered the new ""Oktoberfest Burger"" which according to our email said royalty members could get a sneak preview of and clearly the staff had no idea about this, except one server who said you did have all that was needed to make the burger. My grandmother ordered a diet pepsi, and it was flat and mixed with rootbeer. The manager ""Billy"" said there was nothing he could do to fix it. Word for word. When it could have been as simple as, ""I'm sorry, our diet isn't working tonight, I would love to get you something else"" as opposed to making unnecessary excuses as to how he had no control. Twenty-five minutes later our food arrived. My entree as well as all three burgers we ordered was cold. The ""Oktoberfest""s were missing some of the ingredients. The chicken sandwich we ordered was barely warm. When Billy returned, he said, ""There's no way I can make you happy."" And my fiancé stated that by saying that he was already giving up, and he was cutting off communication. To which this manager said he was disrespecting him and he needed to leave. Absolutely in no way was he being disrespectful, he was trying to help the manager better this really terrible situation.  Our server was ""DD"", minus her mistake of letting us sit for 10 minutes, she was lovely. This manager though, ruined everything. My grandmother had literally just flown in after a long flight and this was the disservice we received. Billy is ill equipped to problem solve and communicate. Things can go wrong at a restaurant, but show heart and try to mend things and simply be nice and give good service and we could have left happy full customers. Instead, you have lost a customer; we spent our money at Applebee's, who had impeccable service by the way. We were greeted once we got in the door, sat right away, and received our food and drinks with a smile and in a timely manner. And this is a reoccurring event; in the last couple years (mind you we go for the food not the terrible service you consistently provide) I have had a hair on my plate, a big black long one that came with no apology to my oblivious server. Another time we had a server never once ask us how our food was, I had to go to the bar for a refill of water, she also entirely forgot our appetizer, and when the expo brought our entrees out and I mentioned we were supposed to have a starter, she didn't say or do anything. Our server spent more time gossiping and flirting with her coworkers than she did talking to us. When I spoke to the manager (again Billy) I informed him of her poor service, to which he replied (word for word), ""I can talk to her, but I can't guarantee that it will do any good."" Are you freaking kidding me? Don't you pay people to do their job? And if she's not doing her job, why the heck are you letting her work?  So thank you, for ruining one of my favorite places to eat. You won't see us in there again. 301395 Reference number for corporate.

Our waiter was very attentive and kept great eye contact (being funny) with the kids as he was moving around the tables to keep them entertained while waiting. Really nice guy. Wish we had one like this close to home, but alas, our local place closed some years ago.

67,Michelle C.,"Medford, OR",0,5,,3.0,2014-01-20,"I've gotta say this was one of my favorite places to eat, but standards have seemed to have slipped over the last year or so. The service to the table is spotty, you sometimes get a good server, sometimes not.  I'm not sure if it's because we tend to go before or after the crowds but the fry refills always seem cold and stale, when they eventually get back to your table. My two favorite burgers to get there (the pub and the shroom) have since become somewhat tasteless. I have also found that when you say ""well done"" the burger typically comes a bit more chard and dry, then juicy and cooked through. The burgers themselves have little flavor and in the case of the shroom burger, the toppings aren't flavored either. Its like the mushrooms were just left to soak in warm grease and cheese was melted on top.  Despite it being a previous family favorite, it will probably be a while before we take a chance on this place again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-medford?start=60,2.8,2.8,2.8,3.0200000000000005,2.8

A chain with mid-level family friendly ""card carrying"" charm, has broken our burger hearts for the last time.  Digs: If you are one of the few that have never entered the gates of RR imagine jammed walls of photos and paintings capturing the safe pop-art Americana closely tied to an Applebee's decor but not tapping into the local team sports memorabilia; the interior has not varied or changed in the 10+ years I've grazed their menu; Ate: Teriyaki ""Bonsai"" Burger - when our food finally arrived after a healthy 25min wait, it was a full-flavored, hardy pile of pineapple flavor, sauces, meat trimmings; it's my go-to; no negativity from my menu choice; Bottom-less Fries - steak fries, salted and crisp; it's the staple and survival (flashing back to my college years in Spokane, saving $ for endless RR fries); honestly nothing great but standard craving averted; Service: This is where the stars fell...fast. The staff became allusive almost frightened by feeding the scary rush of business lunch; (cue ghostly howls); we were greeted kindly but then neglected from ordering to the final payment; each step seemed grueling; two of party members had to literally track down the waitress to pay then receive our checks back to finally sign; I kept recalling the hordes of sorority girls flocking to fries in 15+ groups and waiters drowning them in sugary slurps of alcohol and baskets of fun, but this location crashed in an oily fire; Overall: Red Robin can maintain a tolerable menu but their service crumbles with neglect. I love a 2-hour lunch but not when it's due to the overwhelmed waitstaff. From ordering, to plating, to paying it stretched to the point of insult. Most at the table worked for the service industry and understand the madness but it surpassed our patience. Medford has other meaty options that deserve our money and time.

WHY isn't there ketchup on any of the tables anymore?! The whole table had fries and we were never even asked about ketchup.  WHY isn't there any sweeteners on the table?

I went to order my usual, that I've been having for years and was sadly disappointed when told the ingredients in it have changed. Seeing that I wouldn't like the new edition, I ordered the California chicken sandwich. It arrived and the chicken was almost raw. Sent it back. Without being asked anything I was brought another one, which at that point I wanted nothing to do with. I changed my order yet again and went with a garden burger (something you can't mess up) and it came incorrectly. Annoyed by the situation I just ate it anyway, seeing as how my party was already done and had been for some time now. I was offered a free sundae for the inconvenience yet still charged.

The peppercorn bacon was so thin you could see thru it; reminded me of the bacon you get at a Denny's. The drinks although you could have refills were $4.99 way overpriced. I would not recommend this place to anyone that is looking for a great burger for a decent price.

People after us were served before us.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-medford,2.84,3.07,3.07,,2.9779999999999998
5,Lauren S.,"Anchorage, AK",0,6,,3.0,2018-01-09,"3/4 burgers we had tonight were good, but when I brought home a salmon burger to my wife when she got off work, we opened it to find a very badly freezer burned piece of farmed fish. I know, farmed fish is to be expected at a chain restaurant, but this barely passed for fish. She couldn't even eat the burger it was so bad, ate the fries and trashed the sandwich.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-medford,2.92,3.07,3.07,,3.01

2,Jon K.,"Central Point, OR",0,7,,1.0,2018-01-14,"This establishment has become a subpar chucky cheese millennial hiring factory. The waiters/ waitresses are completely fixated on getting done with they're shift, rather than servicing customers properly. I haven't been here in 2 years because of the poor service and seems as though nothing has changed. I will not recommend this establishment to anyone I know in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-medford,2.76,3.07,3.07,,2.9459999999999997
