13,Katy D.,"Palm Bay, FL",25,24,421.0,4.0,2015-08-20,"We made reservations weeks ago to attend Red Robin's soft opening (they don't officially open until 8/24), where we received a complimentary meal, drinks, and appetizer.  I have to admit, I was very skeptical about this place, as I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants, however, I was extremely impressed with how smooth and flawless our experience was, considering they were still in training. We have been to quite a few openings of new restaurants lately, and there have always been problems. We did not have one single issue at Red Robin.  Our server, Melissa (Missy), was friendly and efficient. Several staff members, including management, stopped by to check on us. Everyone was friendly and had a big smile. I appreciate the great customer service. Our food came out fast, and was beautifully presented, and exactly as we ordered it. Bus boys continually surveyed the tables looking for anything they could take away.  ***The Food*** To me, the food was just alright, nothing special. I ordered the BLTA Croissant, and it was tasty. I have ordered something similar at Applebees before, and Red Robin's was much better. The croissant was very fresh and delicious, and all of the toppings were fresh. My only complaint is that the turkey wasn't the best quality, which I guess it to be somewhat expected.  I ordered a side of chili, not expecting much, but oh my goodness was it good. It's spicy, but so delicious. My husband really enjoyed his food. He got a black and blue burger with a side of garlic fries. My daughter ordered the kids cheeseburger, and loved it. We will definitely be going back once they open later this month. You can tell they have worked really hard to have a great opening.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-melbourne?start=20,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.48

If you like the sound of helium balloons being filled every 60 seconds, servers yelling across the building, soggy salads and crispy burgers, look no further. This place has been opened one week and it already is run down and filthy. It's all about expectations.

47,Katherine S.,"Melbourne, FL",9,29,35.0,3.0,2015-09-13,"Upon arrival on a Sunday evening we were told there would be a 20-25 min wait for 2. They took my cell number and said they'd text when our table was ready. There are no benches outside, and minimal seating on the inside- which is a very small area with the hostess podium also sharing the space. It is very chaotic in the lobby. After 20 mins we received our text and came back inside. The hostess told us to stand to the left- while she promptly seated 2 people she very obviously knew, even though they just walked in the door. (It is packed in here and families of 4/5 are waiting 45mins.) After 3-5 mins we were seated after witnessing our hostess and the girl seating us (Carmella) exchange words due to confusion on who was being seated when/where. Our server (Melissa) is pleasant, a little spacey, and hard to hear as she is in the process of losing her voice and it's quite noisy in here. It was about 20mins after placing our order for an Uberburger w/fries and a Tavern Double w/fries (mine) and side of brown gravy that our food arrived. I had ordered mine with no pink and I was pleased with the burger and with the gravy and fries. The gravy was dank! My husband asked for his burger with pink...It was pretty well done. He said it was just okay. Overall the food was decent, but the service and layout was confused and congested. I did see a server/seater named Courtney who was hustling like a champ. She was just in work mode and seemed to be one of the few who knew what she was doing. Also there was a gentleman (didn't see his name) with dreads and tattoos that was very informative to his tables as to how to use the Ziosk order/pay system and descriptive about menu items. He also seemed to be the leader for singing a Birthday song to a table and was extremely helpful and friendly. I really just wish that most of the staff would go and visit the Port Orange Red Robin that my husband and I have been to numerous times and see how well oiled of a machine it is. It's what made us wish we had one in Melbourne...hopefully they'll get their act together.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-melbourne?start=40,2.0920000000000005,2.0920000000000005,2.0920000000000005,2.0920000000000005,2.0920000000000005
71,K M.,,0,14,12.0,4.0,2015-09-14,"Went on a Friday night with my very pregnant friend. Being a new restaurant, we knew it would be busy and were willing to wait. The line was out the door and they said they would text me when they were ready for us. No place to sit outside, so we just went back and sat in the car. You could see via the link they gave you where in line you were, not surprisingly, parties of 6-8 people were waiting an hour+. They texted us and we were sat in only 15 minutes which was awesome. Appetizers and desserts you had to order on the little machine on the table which was simple enough to use. We ordered the donuts, chocolate fruffles and Bar Wings 'n' Yukon Chips. The wings were awesome, as were the donuts. I didn't care for the fruffles. By the time our food came I was stuffed. The two bites I did manage out of the Royal Red Robin was good. Also the spiked grasshopper was great. I have no complaints other then the water. It was nasty. I'd go there again, but definitely not with a lot of people unless you're willing to wait a long time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-melbourne?start=60,2.2239999999999998,2.2239999999999998,2.2239999999999998,2.2239999999999998,2.2239999999999998

78,Michael F.,"Melbourne, FL",3,13,,1.0,2015-12-20,"This restaurant is the worst eating establishment in Brevard County. Please take all the negative Yelp comments seriously. The food was cold and had no taste. It is way too expensive for hospital cafeteria food. The food at Red Robin is definitely is not gourmet. Our waiter Mario was the worst waiter I have ever had. In addition for a new restaurant this one is very dirty, especially the restrooms. Now I will expand on this. It was a 20 minute wait with limited seating in the hostess area and the exterior of building. Once seated it took 15 minutes for our waiter Mario to take our drink order and at the same time my wife ordered a french onion soup. Since Red Robin offers a kiosk system at their tables, I felt Mario should have taken the time to explain how it worked. The french onion soup came out with our drinks and the onions were hard and uncooked which was bad enough but there was a large piece of onion skin in the bowl as well. A disgusting way to start a meal. It took 15 minutes before Mario returns to our table to take our order. And then the wait began. 34 minutes later, Mario strolls back to our table and ask us if we wanted dessert. ""Dessert I said, I want our meal"" which still had not come out to the table. Not only did Mario not have a clue that we never received our food, he actually never came back to check to see if everything was correct and to ask if we needed anything else. Let's get to the ""gourmet"" food now. The kids Kraft Mac & cheese was ice cold. My whiskey burger had no taste, was cold as well, and came with 6 steak fries. I should add that it was not much bigger than a slider. You would get a better burger at White Castle or Krystal's! Where is the endless basket of fries they advertise famously on television? Because I over heard the lady sitting at the table next to ours complain about her fries being cold, I requested that for mine to be well done so they would be hot which they weren't. As for my wife's chicken sandwich, I will stick to Chick-fil-A next time. What I think happened is Mario forgot our food in the window and by the time he was told by us, it was cold. Instead of re-firing the order, Mario chose to serve it anyway. No one during this entire time stopped by our table, not even a manager. Finally, the hostess walking by heard us talking and asked me what was wrong. I told her everything that that happened and she did offer to have the manager come over but I just wanted to leave at that point. 2 minutes later I heard our waiter Mario comment to one of the other employees that we could go find better service next time at another restaurant. He said this at a distance I could hear him and in front of other guests. I then decided to speak to the manager, Kim, because enough is enough and Mario crossed the line with his comment. I plan on calling the corporate office tomorrow with regards to this experience. This location is so bad I would not recommend taking your worst enemy there to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-melbourne?start=60,2.148,2.148,2.148,2.148,2.148

After another  30 min our food arrived all of the fries were cold and my sister in laws chicken sandwich tasted spoiled. Since we couldn't find Melissa we told  another waitress that the chicken was bad. Finally Melissa came by and asked what was wrong with the chicken so we told her and she said that she had the chicken sandwich earlier and it was fine. Well at this point we were extremely upset over the crappy service.

Both times the wait was ridiculously long (37 minutes the second time for a 30 minute estimated wait on 1 adult, 1 child.) and the front end staff gives the impression that they have better things to do.Ill focus on the second visit since it's the better of the two. When we are finally seated, to their credit it wasn't another 20 minute wait for a server, it was instantaneous , although we waited 25 minutes after ordering our appetizer.. The server was very friendly, and attentive to my 8 yr. Old nephew but did not come around often. 2 minutes after aps(I had to stop my server to check on) show up....in come the entrées. It took 20 more minutes to give our desert order. They kept directing me to the order screen on the table but I have no interest, and let my server know that. Our deserts came 15 minutes apart, and I ended up having mine packed up, (I asked for a refund but I guess he misheard me, and I just wanted to end this 2 hour debacle). I only ordered it because my nephew ordered something. All in all good food HORRIBLE service model. I imagine they cut staffing for this table side electro - ordering device, and in my eyes it's a big zero!

I ordered the bonsai salad, while my dad ordered the fish and my son and mom ordered a burger. After about 25ish minutes, our server asked if we wanted some fries while we waited. I should've know something was up when they asked that because we've never been asked that before.  Another server comes up and basically drops half a basket of fries on the table. No plates, and they're cold. This night is getting better and better.  Our server comes to seat another table and asked if we got the fries, and I let him know yes and they were cold. He apologizes and gets another order going for us. Those are hot, but again, no plates. My mom tries to ask him for Tobasco sauce, but he doesn't hear, so I get up to go get it.  We waited one hour, I know this because Sol checked when we ordered.  And guess what? They gave me a burger.....not even interested anymore. I know I asked for the salad because my server asked what kind of dressing I wanted, and I opened the menu to show him the page and verify it did come with dressing.  I sent the burger back and had them remove it from the bill. No dinner for me tonight. My dad's fish was good, and the burgers were ok. (My son commented on how everything was unbalanced. Like half of the burger had nothing on it. I'm assuming nothing was wrong with the taste because he inhaled it.)  Off night? Perhaps. Because it's fairly new? Maybe.

17,Kayla W.,"Melbourne, FL",19,18,26.0,4.0,2016-02-26,"This is my second time here and I feel better about this experience. I always give a second and third chance when it comes to eating establishments. The first time I came was during the soft opening and it was overly hectic (which was to be somewhat expected) and I did not like having a pressed burger.  This time around we were quoted a 25 to 30 minute wait for seating, however we only waited about 15 minutes. (It was packed but lively and moving.) We ended up waiting around 20 minutes for our food. This time I had the Garden burger and sweet potato fries. Boy! Whoever was in the kitchen tonight had a heavy hand! My burger was VERY spicy. It was loaded with dijon dressing. I love spicy food, but holy sh*t! The sweet potato fries were perfectly cooked but salty. Great portions, just a bit sloppy. Our waiter was attentive, friendly and answered every question we had. My daughter is usually very apprehensive with any stranger but our waiter got her to open right up.  We all agreed we'd be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-melbourne?start=20,2.28,2.28,2.28,2.6079999999999997,2.28

41,Mary M.,"Palm Bay, FL",9,3,,1.0,2016-03-05,"If you are under any time constraints this is not the place for you.  We got a table immediately. But after fifteen minutes we still hadn't heard from our server. It was about 12:00 on a Friday but there were only five other tables in use out of about thirty or thirty-five tables. We had never been there before so we figured maybe we had to ring for our server when we were ready, on the little device that was on the table. So we did. The server who answered our call asked if we needed anything and we said ""Yeah, we would like to order"" and she told us ""YOUR server should be here shortly"" and left.  After another ten minutes a girl came to our table to get our order. She asked if we wanted our sons order brought out first and we said yeah that would be nice, he's kind of a slow eater it would be good to get him started. I might add that this was the last time we saw our server until after we had already paid with their automated device and were walking out the door. His mac-n-cheese (Kraft style), oranges, and apple juice came out about ten minutes later and he had time to finish everything and get restless (about another thirty minutes) before our food came. We are now over an hour and just receiving our food.  The burgers were mediocre and the fry portion could fit in the palm of my hand, yes they are ""bottomless"" but you have to have a server attending your table in order to get your refill.

Five Guys, Steak and Shake and even Burger King burgers are tastier. I wouldn't mind paying $10 to $14 for a good burger but I was not happy with a grey piece of something that is supposed to be beef.  They also tried to add 1.99 entertainment fee for some cheap games on a tabletop device we did not play. It does have fine print staying the fee but we did not agree to it and had to get the manager to remove the charge. The wait staff and Manager treated us fine. They do have a few good choices for side dishes. I had fruit salad that cost only $0.49 extra and refills for sides are unlimited although we did not reorder and the waitress did not ask if we wanted more. Also, $8.99 is high for a 28 oz draft beer. What happened to Red Robin?

Due to wait times, we opted to sit in the bar area which was bit of a tight squeeze.  But it allowed us to order pretty quickly.  However, the wait time for the good seemed to be a little on the long side considering we only ordered burgers... I opted for the Southern Charm Burger.  The cost was about $14.  Included candied bacon, carmalized onions, cheddar cheese, and bbq sauce.  To me it was just ok. I would have liked for the bacon to have more falvor and the kitchen skimped on the onions.  My mom had the Royal Red Robin and she said it was good, but she would have liked for the egg to be cooked a minute longer.  I opted for the garlic fries for the up charge, and they were tasty. Overall, it was a little pricy for burgers and fries in my opinion.  The beef was tasty but nothing spectacular.  I'd give them another try to taste some of the happy hour plates.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-melbourne,2.28,2.28,2.28,2.6719999999999997,2.28

9,Katie W.,"Jacksonville, FL",9,133,54.0,1.0,2016-05-11,"When I lived in Virginia, Red Robin was our absolute go to place for a good meal! The one we went to had an open kitchen where you could see them make your food and it was always A+. So imagine my enthusiasm when I found out that there would be a Red Robin going into Melbourne!  First visit was only a couple weeks after their opening.  We hit them at an off time to avoid waiting. Our server was decent and experience was good. Just good. Food was not as good as I had remembered but chalked it up to opening quirks.  This past Saturday was our second visit. The experience started off promising as our server seemed friendly. That quickly went down hill. Appetizer was really slow to come out. I ordered an alcoholic drink but after wanted a water with my meal. I had to ask 6 times. Fiancé ordered a beer, got the wrong beer but drank it anyways since he thought it would be more of a hassle to get the server. Burgers took forever to come out and were horribly greasy. He asked for a refill on his fries. 20 minutes later no fries. At this point in time our server is flat out ignoring our table. Pretty much hoping we'd pay on the ziosk machine and leave. Flagged down another staff member who brought out cold fries. Server came over and asked if we were paying by card or cash. Basically just assumed because he had ignored us for over 20 minutes that we didn't want anything else. I asked for a manager who came over, thanked us for the feedback, handed us a free appetizer card and left. It was the most ""I could care less"" attitude I've ever seen.  Upon checking my receipt later on I realized that we were charged $7.79 for a beer!! The wrong beer at that!! Yes, I should have looked closer at the restaurant but I wanted to leave.

Skipping the decor since I detailed that last time, I will go straight to the food. The time it took to make did not take long, but now the lack of decorum with said food is accompanied by an unsatisfactory taste. I took one bite of my grilled four-cheese sandwich with a burger patty and I was disgusted. Thinking it was me following the waiter's preference to add said burger patty into the sandwich, I took it out and ate it as if it were made to order. Not much of a difference. Maybe it will taste better with chicken but I will not know. Only positives were the unlimited orange creme sodas and the friendliness of our waiter Brian. He was so nice and very funny.

31,Don U.,"Melbourne, FL",17,94,110.0,4.0,2017-04-25,"I was pleasantly surprised.  I have never been to one and was a little blown away when I walked in, was expecting a more open space but this worked well, a little more quaint I guess.  I got the Original Burger I think it was called, according to the story it was what made them famous, so...it was really good.  Good steak fries.  That burger, fries, and one Bud Light was $14Ish, I know the beer was $3.50 so if your a soda drinker or have kids in tow it's fairly reasonable.  The burger was $9.99.  I thought it was a good burger for sure.  I liked the story behind the name Red Robin, I can see that.  It's safe for kids I would say, they have a full bar on display to see, but have a dinning area where that is not in view: the back of the bar acts as a wall.  It's cool, glad I stopped.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-melbourne,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64

The waitress didn't acknowledge us at first, for taking care of the exiting tables drink order after we'd been there for almost 15 mins. We just wanted to have a nice dinner as a family and it was just one disappointment after another. We were excited to go here but $50 later for some burgers and fries. Totally wasn't what we expected from the place.

20,April J.,"Cocoa, FL",0,7,3.0,5.0,2017-07-08,"Went to Red Robbins for the first time back in April. We have tried to go in the past but the wait times were always long especially with kids. Our wait time this time was suppose to be 20-30 mins but was really 10-15 mins. Great food, wonderful waiter (need I say his name too), and good environment. I had two kids with me and my husband. Everyone loved the food. My son (1 years old with an NG tube) had a restricted diet and the menu was good enough for him. Accommodations were also made for him because of his allergies as well. Greatly appreciated. We all went him full and happy. Anything involving their fries and garlic is excellent. We had three refills and I don't eat that much fries.

4,James C.,"Fort Myers, FL",31,4,1.0,3.0,2017-08-08,"I don't mind Red Robin they are decent restaurants with pretty decent burgers. My server was in bad but my server wasn't great either. I took about 10 mins to get to my table and it wasn't that busy. However, she got my beer and my appetizer out pretty quickly. I ordered a Burger can't remember what kind it wasn't bad but I ordered a medium and a defiantly came out medium rare. I don't mind Medium rare  but That is not what I Ordered. After that I wasn't quite done and she told me to pay with the little tablet on the table which is kind of cool can be convenient however was also kind of Impersonal for Me Too! And then I had a problem with that tablet and wich it made it awkward Because she still wouldn't just take my card should go find the right one to make it work. Over all wasn't too bad the guy I'm not the kind of guy to just complain. The service just seemed a little in personal for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-melbourne?start=20,3.28,3.28,3.28,,3.2800000000000002

25,Paula P.,"Melbourne, FL",121,41,85.0,4.0,2017-08-25,I really enjoy going to this place. My first time was last year for my birthday and I ended up getting a free Burger which was really awesome. They signed me up for a rewards card to earn products. The service was fast and efficient and the food was cooked very well and cooked to my liking. Also having endless fries is always a bonus. I would have to say their prices are worth what you pay. And then this year I went around my birthday again among other times and then I got a free Burger when my husband and I were there. The only thing that I didn't like was the fact that we were sitting next to a crying baby that the parents wouldn't take outside and have her to see for the other patrons in the establishment. Then to add to that on the other side of us was a drunk guy with two young girls who is speaking way too loud and the girl who is doing drinks was encouraging him which really wasn't a smart idea. But something like that is not what the establishment can fully control. You are what you make of the area and I have to say this is definitely a really good one,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-melbourne,3.28,3.28,3.28,,3.2800000000000002
33,Rob L.,"Kissimmee, FL",38,5,4.0,1.0,2017-09-17,Well this place was just terrible our server was fantastic o must say but the food was worse than a $1 burger from McDonald's. We both ordered the premium burgers which looked nothing like the pics the burgers had an extremely small patty it was thrown together. The fries were really nice and the sauces were good but overall I could have gone through a drive thru and had a better meal.. maybe the 6.99 burgers are just as good but I won't be back to try,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-melbourne,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006
1,Sean W.,"Sanford, NC",14,20,4.0,1.0,2017-11-19,"Having been to one in mass when,we lived up there expected good service and food. Boy were we disappointed. First, sat quickly but took the waitress 10,mins to take our water order to start before we even got to order drinks. Another 10 mins to order drinks which we decided to order fried pickle app and our entrees since we didn't want to sit another 20 mins without anything. Well, after a total of 25 mins sitting there,I saw the mgr drop our app near the cooking area so 5 mins later we got over fried pickles and the worse part is HE delivered them and thought nothing of it. The waitress 2 mins later delivered our food. Suprise,... Took the pickles wothout even asking if we wanted to replace them anf took them off the order. Food was notttttttt good at all. And to boot the. Waitress never came back until we were done. I ordered the cheesecake slice and she added hot fudge, strawberry sauce and cherry sauce. For the price, not worth it. Tip was more than I should have given but she can thank my wife for that. Would NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE.
