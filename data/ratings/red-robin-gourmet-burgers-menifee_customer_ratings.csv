51,Cindy W.,"Carlsbad, CA",2235,1958,4356.0,4.0,2014-01-06,"My husband decided to check this place out after shopping at Target. We've lived in the area for 3 years and this is our first time trying Red Robin (says a lot, doesn't it?) But with two loud kids, we figured this is the place for them to do whatever they want and be loud without feeling guilty about it.  We arrived and got seated almost immediately. My daughter was impressed with the television in the floor by the waiting area.  We weren't that hungry, so we skipped the appetizer, but I got the raspberry lime soda while my husband got an arnold palmer (hey, that's my drink!)  We got my daughter the kids grilled cheese with a side of broccoli and she ate more of the broccoli than the burger (my girl loves her broccoli). I ordered the Royal Red Robin Burger which had an egg on it, it was really good, but messy. Boy are the big too! I could barely finish my burger! I also swapped out the fries for sweet potato fries instead. Which were also really good. They gave us two options for ketchup dipping to go with it.  My husband got the Whiskey River BBQ burger and he really enjoyed his as well, but like I said, the portions are big so we didn't finish our burgers and were too full to take advantage of the bottomless drinks. The fries are bottomless too, but we didn't get to take advantage of that.  On New Year Eve, it was still pretty full at 11:30 am, so I can imagine it being packed during any other day, so arrive here hungry with an empty stomach.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-menifee?start=40,3.12,3.12,3.12,2.7039999999999997,3.1200000000000006

107,Cristine P.,"Menifee, CA",113,113,25.0,4.0,2014-02-09,"Went to Red Robin's on Saturday night & quickly got a booth at the bar. At first we put our names on the waiting list and were expecting to wait 20 minutes but because we looked at the (seat yourself) bar seating, we got served right away! Nice!  What was even MORE awesome was that not only was the service superb, the bar area was ages 21 and over and that rule was abided by! It's great to be able to be in an adult environment sometimes and not be near a bunch of loud children when you would rather enjoy some peace and quiet. I wish more restaurants offered this option.  There was a good selection of beers including Stone IPA and Blue Moon. The soft drinks were bottomless and so were the deliciously-seasoned French fries. The fries didn't taste frozen either which is a plus because most restaurant fries taste freezer-burned unless fresh.  Our food was prepared as we requested. I had a concern with something of mine and it was immediately replaced. I felt no guilt because they truly made me feel good about being a patron! They supplied my messy self many napkins and refilled our drinks.  Overall it was a great place! If I could press anything it would be that the front staff seemed a little scattered maybe because there wasn't exactly a podium (which made me feel awkward.) Also, I would like to add that whomever I guessed to be the manager -- did walk around but never actually interacted with guests. The assumed manager was very quiet and mostly just talked to the employees -- I think it would have been a better experience if the manager would have interacted with guests. You never know how their day is going so I'm not upset or anything it's just a note.  I'd go again and definitely sit in the bar area!

He was disappointed that it wasn't bigger for an $11 burger. He also got the endless rootbeer float.

1,Felix L.,"Los Angeles, CA",1021,558,15580.0,2.0,2015-06-21,"The host showed me a table immediately after I walked in and handed me a very descriptive menu that was full of pictures. She sat me near two large TVs broadcasting live sports. It was a great start, before the rest of the experience went downhill. I ordered the bleu ribbon burger and a chicken tortilla soup. The server hand-wrote my order on a partitioned section of her booklet, which felt very old fashion. This restaurant does not have a modern tablet ordering system that I noticed from another Red Robin location. The interactive tablet allows customers to place orders, request refills, and pay without the presence of wait-staff. Chicken tortilla soup arrived first, and it was the worst I've ever had of this type. Watery, filled with frozen corn but lacking main ingredients such as chicken and avocado, the cheese was not grated thin enough for me, overloaded with sour cream, and the fried tortilla strips were completely flat at arrival without any crunch. Not to mention the price, $3.29 for about 6oz of soup, is even higher than what Whole Food charges. The bleu ribbon burger was decently executed although the combination of ingredients was not very imaginative. This burger is supposed to be unique from other Red Robin burgers by including a beef patty that is rubbed in steak sauce, and then topped with crumbled bleu cheese and crispy fried onion shreds. Meh. I thought that the sweetness of the chipotle aioli overpowered the taste of the patty. Also for some reason, I just couldn't really taste the distinct bitterness of bleu cheese. Furthermore, My burger must be covered with butter because I had a heavy feeling in my stomach after consumption. Sweet potato fries, included with the burger, are refillable and this is supposed to be the signature point at Red Robin. However, it meant nothing since service was nearly non-existent. Like many All-American chain restaurants, one server was responsible for an area of the restaurant. My server was either inefficient or assigned to way too many tables, because every time I wanted to make a request, she was either scrambling around the kitchen, loading up trays, or busy taking orders. I finished my burger and then waited 15 to 20 more minutes just for my first refill of fries. In my opinion, Slater's 50/50 outperforms this chain with perfunctory service, use of innovative seasonal ingredients, and high level of customization.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-menifee?start=20,3.28,3.01,3.01,2.408,3.118

This time our food was cooked just fine but it took 28 minutes to come out then one of the orders was wrong. Nothing was special. The old garlic fries were amazing, these new ones are just fries with garlic and way too salty. No refills on those and they cost extra. Our refills on the regular fries came out at the end of our meal when everyone was almost finished. Anything gluten free also costs extra. Burgers tasted okay but nothing special.  The freckled lemonade is still amazing!   One adult and two children (no alcohol and one water as a drink, no appetizers or dessert) cost $44.

She wasn't so happy or pleasant to speak to since there was no ""hello"" or smile, just ""how many and your name?"". That didn't really bother me.  What bothered me the most was after a 15-20 min wait people that came after me were being seated. I mean I get it, it's a busy day and you have a lot of people but considering that my party was only 2 people I figured that it'll be easy; offer the bar or something. So after a party of 2 that came after me were asked if they were over 21 and they would be seated before me, I was pretty mad. I went up to the hostess booth and was told that they were getting a table but they had to seat a table of 6 which by the way came after me. After being called we were seated in the way back corner next to the bathrooms.  The server was very mediocre, nothing special. She did her job and was able to give me a glimpse of hope for my meal.

Requested a refill on fries but apparently the waitress decided we didn't need them since she never brought more. When our meals finally came my daughters egg on her burger wasn't fully cooked even though we requested it to be and they put mayo on my sandwich which I asked not to be put on it. The waitress was apologetic and corrected both mistakes but I really think waitresses need to check there tickets to the orders before they just bring them to the tables. (We just had ice tea and soda so no reviews on the drinks.) My BLTA sandwich was great, I had no mayo or tomato and I added slices of cucumber on the side to put on the sandwich.

We did have the pleasure of our waitress's big butt in our faces every time she leaned over to talk with the elderly group in the next table. We paid 40 dollars for this and then they wanted to tell us how much we should tip her. I tip because the food and server were good.

It came with a huge glob of cheese melting thru the soup, and sticking to the spoon when she tried to remove it. Disgusting! I know Americans like cheese on almost anything, but really..... in the soup? I bet the French would not want to be associated with this item. This cost you some stars, the burgers were fine, the beer was good too. I recommend anyone to avoid the soup, and go with the burgers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-menifee?start=20,4.2,3.31,3.31,,3.6660000000000004

My husband and I were in Menifee last Sunday, 113 degrees and wanted a quick lunch. SO thankful to be seated in the adults ONLY section of their lounge. Nothing against kids - but - there is nothing worse than screaming children- kids do NOT belong in a bar! So it is SO nice for a restaurant to allow adults their own space - THANK YOU!   My salad was a complete bargain at $10.99 and I loved that I could see the calorie count (yes I am a little weird) My husband enjoyed his Chicken breast, said it was juicy.

I have to admit, the service was pretty good but don't ever order the Fish and Fries. I'm not sure if it was old, over cooked or simply died of natural causes but it was absolutely the worst fish I have ever eaten.

This is probably the 5th time I have had less than satisfactory service at this location but I have no choice because the only other location in my area is just as terrible. So I deal with it because overall I like the food. Today was like no other the staff seemed overwhelmed and my server seemed frantic. Because of this I asked to be moved out of the bar area (epitome of poor service dont sit at the bar!). Once in a regular seating area our waitress brought us someone else's food whoops. We let her know and after a short time our food arrives. Food mediocre at best this time which is unfortunate because even though they have poor service the food is usually good. I have a mountain of mayo on my burger (see pics) and my gf food is luke warm and the avocado still had seeds in it. Because it will take an eternity to get our food fixed and lets face it I always worry about getting my food spit in when I send it back, I decide to modify my food and press on. She does the same. Im going to avoid this location for awhile. Its always poor but today was exceptionally poor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-menifee?start=20,3.92,3.34,3.34,,3.572

Its all about that one gesture that you will forever remember. Sad so sad.  I would of been glad to of paid for the ballon.  If those balloons were not meant for the kids then don't blow them up where everyone can see them.  Do it out back I need to say that there must of been over 20 balloons and still blowing up more..Hope she sleeps well tonight after seeing our grandsons little sad face.  He is not that kid that throws fits he just sensed her meanness and walked away.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-menifee,3.88,3.31,3.31,,3.5380000000000003

33,Robin W.,"Lake Elsinore, CA",0,13,,4.0,2017-12-08,"I almost never write a review about a chain restaurant, but I am going to make an exception here. I had been craving a good burger. Not one hidden by bread and fixings, but a burger good enough to stand alone with a bun, so you could taste the meat, pink inside and tender, grill marks from open flame grilling. The whole bit. Red Robin hit a home run with their very simple burger, a tavern bun, decorated only by a few sesame seeds, pink inside and tasty as well as juicy. The chef didn't smash down this burger onto the grill. The server was prompt and efficient and knew her menu, which was extensive. My burger came with fries and all the usual decorations on the side, perfect! That allows me to add pickles if I choose or simply eat them solo. Unlimited steak fries of course. I still wish they would opt for the shoe string variety, but then again I would eat too many of them. Nicely done red robin.

Our server was always quick to refill our drinks and make sure we were taken care of so kudos to her for keeping up with my family!

There have been times where my burger is delicious, and others to where I wonder what happened.  The service at this particular location has always been excellent. We've never had an issue with being seated at a decent time, even if it's busy. The table service has also always been great. It just comes down to the food. On this past visit, my California chicken burger was a little dry and the bread was hard, almost as if it was old. My kids and wife's food looked great. No one else had any issues.  The bottomless fries kept coming and like I've mentioned, our waitress was very attentive and would fill up our drinks and fries, lol.
