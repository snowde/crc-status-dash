30,Cindy A.,"Chicago, IL",0,11,,1.0,2013-09-23,"My husband and I like Red Robin's food; however, this location is absolutely terrible.  We have been here several time, always giving it another chance and hoping that they will be better, but the service is always bad.  So, I will only tell you about the last experience there. A group of us (6 total) decided to come here.  We were told that we have to wait 10 minutes...not bad...but we ended up waiting for 30 minutes, but did I mention that it was slow and we were actually looking at our table...which was clear and clean?  So I am not sure why we had to wait so long. Then, it took our waitress 10 minutes to come and greet us, saying that she will be right back to take our drink orders.  Then came back 5 minutes later.  We placed our drink and food order, since we had 15 minutes to look at the menu. My husband ordered a shake, which was not the correct one when they brought it out.  He also did not receive the correct food order. We asked for separate checks at the beginning of the meal, but the waitress ended up putting 2 of the other orders on our check...which made it a bit awkward. So, we had to ask for a correct check.   She only came to check on us once throughout our dinner.  The check took a while to come back as well. If you like their food, just go to a different location.  The service at this location is always disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-merrillville?start=40,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000005

We even told are server about the time crunch we were on and received our food in no more than 5/8mins. Quite reasonable in my book. Server was super friendly and attentive. Food is OK, but I've never gone to RR for a best burger but it isn't god awful like others liked to point out. 2 downsides. We did wait at the door without being greeted right away,somewhat annoying, and the flavor in the flavored teas all just sits at the bottom no matter how much you stir.

When I asked the waitress for more sauces she said she would have to charge us. I explained that what they brought out wasn't even full then showed her the menu picture.

My husband and I met some friends at this particular Red Robin last weekend.  We were unpleasently surprised to find that the whole restaurant had been remodeled and not in a good way.  All of the booths were taken out except for just a few and replaced with tables.  SHORT tables!!  At 5'6"" I am by no means tall.  But I felt like a giant sitting at the new table.  It was so low I felt like I was eating out of my lap!  Not very comfortable at all!!The restaurant was EXTREMELY crowded and now that all the booths are gone it was noisier than usual.  Our waitress was extremely overwhelmed.  My husband ordered a beer about 10 min. after we sat down (when the waitress finally took our order).  Unfortunately, he did not receive his beer for another half hour.  And that was after it sat out on the bar and got warm.  There wasn't even any frost on the glass anymore!!  Then our food came.  All four of us ordered burgers which were all fine.  Everything was cooked properly and still warm but the fries that accompanied our burgers were ICE cold.  Service was extremely slow compared to what it used to be and all of the servers seemed to be confused.  We watched numerous people around us, all whom had been seated AFTER us, be served before us.  Not sure what is going on with Red Robin, but I really didn't feel comfortable there with the new rennovations and I certainly didn't appreciate the slower service.   Probably won't be going back to this one for a while until they can get their act together!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-merrillville?start=40,1.9280000000000002,1.9280000000000002,1.9280000000000002,1.9280000000000002,1.9280000000000004

29,Paila M.,"Merrillville, IN",0,1,,1.0,2015-02-09,This had to be the worst dining experience I have ever experienced in my entire life! We arrived around 6 PM there was no hostess so we waited and waited and waited and finally she came out looked at me and said just a minute walked away then we waited and waited and waited some more we should have known better this was a red flag should have walked out the door. She finally took our name I requested a booth for for to celebrate my husbands birthday she said I'll let you know when it's ready another party of four came in following us and we're seated before us in a booth right next to the one we were finally seated in. It only gets better from here...we waited and waited some more and finally we received a waitress Amanda she was very friendly she took our order and that's the last time we saw her until we had some issues with our order. A very large party came in and took over the staff at the restaurant. Our waitress included. our food finally arrived cold and incomplete mind you my husband also also ordered a root beer float that he did not get until our meal came he went to the bar and asked for it himself. The sandwich I ordered was not correct we were missing the oranges from the kids meals. We flag down another server to try to correct the problems and possibly get refills on drinks and some straws because we never received them or silverware. No real beer float again so my husband went to the bar and got it himself that's when someone from the bar area came out and gave me an extremely dirty look and I gave it right back to her. My family was done with their meal before my sandwich came I at this point had lost my appetite and the sandwich was incorrect again so I just asked for carry out containers as it was getting late and this party was taking over the entire restaurant. The manager came out and said I will comp the root beer float and the kids meal big deal. And what topped it off we went to use the restroom it was absolutely disgusting and there was no toilet paper!!! The manager kept coming to the table making excuses saying they just fired and hired recently saying that was the reason for the issues. our first waitress came to the table and said I'm sorry about everything but the manager told her to help the party table. No mention of my husband's birthday as they have done in the past when we have gone there for parties. They need to seriously get it together and stop making excuses.Will not return to this location in the future.

4,Rosa J.,"Chicago, IL",373,1007,3544.0,4.0,2015-04-27,"Choices of restaurants outside of Chicago are mostly commercial.  Red Robin is one of the chains that we still, somehow, patronize till these days.   We came in during the weekday afternoon, way passing the lunch-time rush.  Hence, the entire restaurant was peaceful and service was attentive.   Steve, a.k.a. ""Batman,"" was our server.  He literally had his name badge temporarily changed so that he could accomplish this alter-ego.  He was humorous and easy-going.  Hey, I appreciated his creativity, especially working at off-peak times.   We were pretty familiar with the menu at Red Robin, since we've gone to various locations in Chicagoland, Northwest Indiana, and other parts of the United States.  I picked one of my go-to's, the Bleu Ribbon (with blue cheese and fried onion strings); hubby went with the cod sandwich.   We had ""buzz"" caused by the strong morning coffee from Dark Matter (see review on DM if you want to know the alternative solution of getting ""high""). Well...hush...I didn't say that word...at least didn't mean that way... Let's go back to the center of our current discussion, Red Robin (yummmm).  We also shared the artichoke & spinach dip appetizer.  To be quite honest, the level of salinity wasn't optimal.  However, with the amount of caffeine we had in our systems, that extra sodium was merely an elixir.   Burgers at Red Robin were never subpar, yet I couldn't say they were extraordinary.  Their loyalty program is what makes me keep on coming back.  Every nine (9) entrees you've order, the tenth (10th.) one will be free!  You also get a free burger or an entree of your choice on your birthday month.  There are also promotions and coupons as long as you're subscribed to their e-mailing list.   Thank you, Batman...just let you know the new Joker at the new Batman movie looks fierce.  Hopefully he stays ""sane"" this time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-merrillville,2.288,2.288,2.288,2.288,2.2880000000000003
15,Frank J.,"Newark, CA",37,122,761.0,3.0,2015-04-29,"Went here today for lunch to give Red Robin a chance to make up for the horrible service that we receive previously! I can only say...that our server (Charity) continued with the non-charitable mentality from our previous visit! First, when she informed us of her name, I expressed, ""Then this means that she would be giving us much charity?"" She replied, ""It means that she should receive charity!"" I had the nerve to think she was just jesting but...her action deemed otherwise! She asked, could she start us off w/drinks. We stated yes, (2) iced waters w/lemons and could she please change the channel of the screen right in front of us! She said, ""Sure, be right back!"" She left to take care of other patrons, then returned to see if we wanted any appetizers but she didn't bring us the drinks. She brought the waters but NO lemons and didn't change the channel as well! The manager (Gabriel), brought us our appetizer along w/a big smile and courteous voice. Then, I had to ask if he could bring us some lemons as we requested from our server. He expressed he would have someone bring them right away and he would have someone change the channel as well! Funny thing was...just before the manager made this statement, we saw our server pass by with a plate of lemons and tea to another patron whom came into the restaurant after we came...Wow! As (Charity) continued to show NO charity to us, a young server (Jared) w/a GREAT smile came bringing us our lemons! We recognized (Jared) from another restaurant we use to frequent before its closing! He began to give us the great service as he use to give at the other restaurant...and asked us if he could get us anything else! We said, ""Thanks but we are OK, but he also showed our server and the hostess how to change the channel of the screen we were watching! Then after a few minutes the manager, Gabriel, Not our server brought us our entrees. To be truthful...we hadn't seen (Charity) for sometime, now! If you've been to Red Robin before, you no you normally receive unlimited fries with your sandwich order. So, as we waited for over 12 mins for our server to come by to check on us and maybe receive a refill of fries, there was another waitress (Ashley) who was working so hard and fast with the serving of her patrons that as she would pass us by...we could actually feel a slight cool breeze! I am not exaggerating AT ALL! I had to ask her name and. compliment her on her service to others! We expressed to her that her new nickname was ""Cool Breeze""! Afterwards, we all laughed and before she left she ask me if she could refill my water and even give us a refill of fries! She was literally back with water and fries with in 2 mins...now that's GREAT service! Then low and behold, here comes our server (Charity) with a basket of fries as well...and we just saw her pass us by with the new basket of fries Ashley just gave us! Sorry Charity...too late! So now as its time for us to leave guess who wants to show us some charity or at least some attention? Before we left we made sure to give Jared and Ashley a tip for their beyond the call of duty service! Thanks for making up for bad service Jared, Ashley, and Gabriel! That is why I'm giving you guys 3 stars instead of 1 because you have 3 stars at the restaurant with Jared, Ashley, and Gabriel!

Food: dude, it's Red Robin. Don't ask about the food. All the burgers pretty much taste the same. The ""bottomless steak fries"" are pretty bland unless you salt them to kingdom come. Beyond that everything on the menu is deep fried. That's all you need to know.  Service: pretty sure our server was either on her first day, or her last day, cause she did NOT care! My wife ordered Raspberry Iced Tea, but got Raspberry Lemonade. She also ordered an Avacabo salad because she wanted hard-boiled egg... She TOLD the server,  ""I'm getting this because I want hard-boiled egg..""  The salad came and after a minute she noticed that it had no egg on it! The server came back and we asked her about the egg.. The server literally did the following: ""Ohhhh.. Yeah, we are out of egg. Our supplier did not bring any.""  *took 5 steps away and started to open he door to go back inside, then turned around* ""Do you want anything else instead?""  Umm, no, we're good, thanks.  Beyond that we didn't see much of her.  Food was ""meh"" at best. Probably won't be coming back here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-merrillville,2.2,2.2,2.2,,2.2

45,Yolanda T.,"Chicago, IL",5,20,13.0,1.0,2015-10-04,"This is my very last visit to Red Robin in Merrillville. My family waited, along with 5 other parties, for more than 15 minutes to be seated.  There were several tables available, but we all assumed they were slow seating us because they were short handed with servers. While waiting, a party of 6 enters the restaurant  and was seated immediately by a server named Erica.  Mind you, Red Robin does not make reservations. It was obvious that because they were her family they were privileged enough to not have to wait. I expressed my frustration to the hostess and requested to see a manager regarding the blantant disregard for all waiting parties.  Well, this is the first time a manager has never addressed a customer after being requested.  Seems like the entire staff, including the manager needs training on customer service. I only spend my money where it's appreciated. Never again Red Robin in Merrillville.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-merrillville?start=20,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08
35,Andrew R.,"Michigan City, IN",0,6,2.0,1.0,2015-10-17,"This particular Red Robin has a staff that is slow.  The sad part is Red Robin has interactive screens that will take your order which you would think would speed things up. Unfortunately, this establishment was well below par and no  sense of urgency for their customers. Our waitress gave us drinks with no straws and when we used the tablet to have the waitress come to our table it take over 30/minutes. When our onion ring order arrived is was cold. Our waitress Courtney showed no interest in our table or other tables she was responsible for. Overall, you family was highly disappointed and will not be coming back. To add insult to injury we asked for two to go boxes and we were only given one which seemed like the smallest to go box Courtney could find.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-merrillville?start=20,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08
33,Emily A.,"South Loop, Chicago, IL",21,35,4.0,1.0,2015-10-18,"Every time we go here we look at the menu and wonder why we don't come here more often then we experience the service. It's horrible, for being a family restaurant the food takes forever! Also the bottomless fries are funny because you can't really get more if your server doesn't come around. And this time which was the tip of the iceberg I had a disgusting bright red ""something"" smashed into the inside of my diet coke glass. If I'm being honest the food is pretty good, but you can get pretty good food else where and still get quality service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-merrillville?start=20,2.04,2.04,2.04,,2.04
12,Christopher K.,"Hobart, IN",2,10,2.0,4.0,2015-12-10,"Visited as a result of their recent promotion to try their new chicken sandwich (free for people named Christopher for a special holiday promotion). It's a great tasting chicken sandwich topped with bacon, greens, cheese, a special sauce, and a special bun. The fries are bottomless as usual at Red Robin. The staff was friendly and the restaurant atmosphere was pleasant. In previous visits, the prices have tended to be a little bit on the higher side for an overall experience that isn't necessarily exceptional, but it is generally a good quality experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-merrillville,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16
5,Eric G.,"Gary, IN",45,257,313.0,4.0,2015-12-22,"Merrillville is one of the go-to burbs for a lot of the chain stores and restaurants that aren't in the city.   D and I aren't fans of the horrific traffic on its main thoroughfare but we (well D...LOL) needed to do some last minute holiday shopping so brave it we did.    We decided to take a lunch break at RR. We were told the restaurant was busy and asked if we could sit at the bar.   D and I were fine with that...in fact last time we went here we sat at the exact same area in the bar.   Our bartender/server came over to us right away and was working on his ""up-sell"" to buy a drink instead of just water.    He was very humorous about it and gave us both a chuckle.   I did end up ordering their sangria drink which was fine. When going in the back to hit the restroom I noticed the main dining area wasn't as filled up as I thought it was.   I wonder if some of that may play into the long wait times that some reviews have been reporting.    Who knows? But D and I both enjoyed the burgers.   I especially liked their black and bleu burger on their ""finest"" portion of the menu.  The fries servings are light but then again since they are ""bottomless fries"" as long as you're able to flag the server for more fries, it's a moot point. Overall it's a good place to get your burger on that's a slight step above McDonald's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-merrillville,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24

We decided to give them another try at this location.  Pleasantly surprised!  We sat in the bar area and received fresh hot food,  quick friendly service and prompt refills on drinks.  We will be back.   Try not to judge a chain restaurant bad on one location.  Give this place a try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-merrillville,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4

First off, the best server ever, Jared is still working here and even though he wasn't serving our table,  he still took a minute to stop by and speak.  I highly recommend you ask for him if you can. We had Kayla as a server and she was quick and a sweetheart. My experience this time outweighed the bad experiences from before.

I finally flagged her down after 30 minutes (no seriously, 30 minutes!) & asked where our food was. She comes back & says that our 'ticket was lost' & that she had to retake our order. She promised that the order would come quickly, that the kitchen staff was doing ours next in front of all the other orders. Another 20 minutes went by.  I know at this point you've gotta be thinking, ""why wouldn't they just leave?""  The answer, my friends, is simple: we had already invested more than an hour waiting & it has gotten so late, that most other places had closed or were closing. We were determined to wait it out.  We did finally get our food but my husbands burger was not right; nor did we get utensils or napkins. Our sever, once again, had disappeared.  We will NEVER be back.

Let him take you shopping at the mall, Pokémon hunting across the street then go grab a bite before your movie. Theatre is across the parking lot. Great location! Endless fries are get this endless! Salt lovers will need to add salt though. Pretzel bite appetizer was delicious. Refills on drinks just magically appeared. That could be because our waitress Sabrina does an amazing job. She was so cheerful and friendly! The burgers are so yummy. I had the bacon cheeseburger and got to pick out which cheese I wanted. Plus Sabrina did not even blink when I asked for no mayo no tomato and ordered it on an onion roll. Food came out of the kitchen quick and was fresh and so goood! Hubby ordered a burger with so many things on it and it was done right too. Generous portions, delicious food, friendly staff and the manager even did a real table visit not just a pass by! I have not eaten here in awhile and now with this visit going so well I definitely will be back! We only waited a minute or two to be seated and the place had a nice size crowd inside.
