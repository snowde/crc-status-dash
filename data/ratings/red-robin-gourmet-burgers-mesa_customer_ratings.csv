I asked for a basket of fries and she said sure, no problem. We were busy talking and having a good time so it was at least 15 minutes before I thought about the fries, let alone our meal. I stopped the hostess as she walked by and asked her if RR still does free fries. She said yes, but only after someone orders. I told her we had already placed our order about 15 minutes ago and she said sorry and took off toward the kitchen. Within 20 seconds the manager stopped by with fries, apologized, and gave us silverware. He was very nice and I said it was no big deal at all.  Our food arrived about five minutes later, and everything was great, except the onion rings I ordered were overcooked and kinda greasy. Our sever stopped by a few more times but she was completely rude after the fry thing. I really like Red Robin and I know this was just a one-off deal, but it was more than a little off putting on how rude she was. So she forgot our fries, our silverware, let dishes pile up on our table and she was rude about it. lol She's young and I'm sure they'll coach her.

As far as the service goes our waitress really did try, but they seemed like they were understaffed, and the hostess kept seating people in her section.  At any rate the service was slow and we were ignored most the time.

This second time we walked in, three servers were by the bar chatting away, looked over and saw us and didn't come greet us, just continued chatting away while looking around for the host, the host saw us and we finally got sat. Our server came and greeted us and took our orders, but forgot to ask how we wanted our burgers cooked. Our burgers came after watching them sit on the kitchen window getting cold, (couldn't even return them because our server didn't come and check on us and we were starving) then our sweet potato fries didn't come til after we were done with our meal and once again those were cold as well because they were sitting up on the kitchen window.

35,Greg M.,"Mesa, AZ",0,196,19.0,2.0,2014-10-14,"I've been to this restaurant perhaps five times before, I really like Red Robin but this was my worst visit. (10/6/14) i started going to RR in 2009 about once a month or more. We arrived about 5:30pm, the place was busy, we sat in the bar. There was a drunk guy watching football yelling loudly at the TV behind the bar, people were glaring at him. This loser had no clue. Normally, we're served in about 12 minutes, the food is very consistent. Today our food was luke warm, the fries about room temperature. I thought about asking to have my plate nuked but I never send food back, never. The wait this time was 22 minutes, which probably explains the cool food.  And did I miss something, when they started serving fries in these round metallic rings did they also stop the endless fries thing? I think a very similar burger would be the Fudd's half pounder. I think next time we'll go to Fudds instead. This visit really soured me on RR. Oh yeah, their seasoning salt now has sugar added.

47,Clayton J.,"Apache Junction, AZ",5,20,,5.0,2014-10-22,"Red Robin is generally a good place to get a burger, fries and shake. They have excellent onion rings, which is my favorite appetizer to get. The service is usually really good and the burgers are mighty tasty. I enjoy eating here as does my family. I have never had bad service or a bad burger.  For a chain restaurant they do have great burgers and an excellent selection of them. I like their protein burger and that it comes with a salad instead of fries. Tragically it doesn't come with unlimited salad. I am also a huge fan of their bacon chesseburger. Their Royal red robin is fantastic, but afterwards I felt like I was going to have a heart attack. They still have unlimited fries. It's a more upscale Fuddruckers with better burgers. I've never sat at the bar so I can't comment on that. However, everywhere else is very family friendly. I enjoy when the wait staff gets together to sing a birthday song. It always makes me think of Waiting, hopefully I never get the dreaded THUMBS DOWN at any restaurant I eat at. All in all its a sit down chain burger joint. You get what you expect, good burgers friendly wait staff, nothing AMAZING but still worth your money and time.

When we walked in, the place was PACKED, but as we were only a party of two, we were seated within five minutes. We were asked what we'd like to drink, and promptly received what we'd ordered.  When it came time to order our food, we both got burgers: I got the mushroom swiss burger, and she got the gluten-free whiskey river burger. Once we put in our order, we waited for a good 30-40 minutes before the manager, John, came by our table. He explained that her burger was not made gluten-free, and for the inconvenience and the wait, dinner was on him. Our food arrived shortly after he came by our table, and still he comped the meal. Our waiter, Nick, was also fabulous, making sure everything was taken care of without hovering. Although the food was a solid 7 out of 10, the service is what made the experience for me.

16,Greg N.,"Alpharetta, GA",0,4,,5.0,2015-03-20,"Two years ago to this exact day, my wife found out she had celiac's disease. I remember it clearly to this day, we had plans to go to Red Robin later that night.  The news was such a blanket-sweep that no one knew how to feel or act. But to me it felt like she had lost just lost something or someone very close.   Later on that night, she was completely against the idea of going out to eat because she was so upset. But after some convincing, she finally was decided to stick to our dinner plans. When we were looking at the menu she just started crying.  The once enjoyable experience that she loved going out to eat with friends or family would no longer be the same. No more ordering what you want, no more relaxing, not worrying if  the food you just ordered might be cross contaminated. It completely ruined the dining experience for my wife and I. Could we ever enjoy going to Red Robin ever again?? This was her favorite restaurant to go to...  I'm here to tell you that Red Robin STILL is her favorite restaurant.... Why???? Because Red Robin is the only restaurant I know that truly appreciates celiac customers. Not only do they offer gluten-free buns, but they have a dedicated fryer in the kitchen Strickley for celiac customers to prevent cross-contamination. For those of you who don't have celiac's disease or know someone who does, this is huge!!!    My wife gets to keep coming to her favorite restaurant and enjoy the dining experience, not having to worry whether or not the fries she is going to eat are going to make her sick for days...

27,Tim R.,"Mesa, AZ",38,57,12.0,1.0,2015-05-04,"Bad experience after not having been to a Red Robin for a couple years. Took 10nin for our server to come take drink order, another 5min to get water and a beer. Ordered two burgers, both were okay and somewhat bland. My fiance's burger was severely undercooked.

We have been to many Red Robins around the valley and usually love our experience but tonight not so much. Of course it was busy, and I get that but our hostess, Stephanie, didn't even bother to speak to us. She looked at us for a few seconds before my husband spoke up and said ""this many."" She didn't ask us if we had a seat preference and just walked over and pushed 2 small tables together, threw our menus on the table and walked away. Just seemed so rude! Our waitress was sweet as pie but forgetful. And forgetful is fine, but if you can't remember write it down! Erika, our waitress, brought the wrong drink for my daughter, which is fine but then no one offered her coloring papers. She had to get upset seeing all the other kids coloring first, and then we had to ask and then wait 30 minutes and asked 5 times before she finally remembered. At the back of the section, there was a balloon rack with one balloon left. I knew they gave them at the end of the meal so I told my girls to wait and they probably could make us more. The people next to us were leaving, also with 2 girls and their waiter went and made a 2nd one since there was one left on the stand. When it was our turn, there were no more and so sorry.

They have many of the same burgers they have been serving for years -- I still like the Royal Red, which is like breakfast on a burger (bacon, egg, cheese), and the Whiskey River BBQ burger is a classic. Some burgers have been phased out, but they have added several burgers featuring high-end ingredients: the ""D.G.B."" (for ""Darn Good Burger,""maybe?) features oven-roasted tomatoes, roasted garlic aioli and fresh arugula tossed in citrus olive oil dressing on a toasted ciabatta bun. Fancy! The ""Southern Charm Burger"" even features candied bacon. Yeah, it's worth ordering that one just to get some of that. Believe me! The menu now offers beverage pairings for some of the burgers. Service has been consistently friendly, and the servers always make a special effort with my kids, but things can be a little slow when they are full. They have added new touchscreen devices to the tables. These devices can be used to order appetizers and desserts as well as pay the check at the end of your meal. For $1.99, you can unlock a bunch of games to play while you wait, too. That charge just gets tacked onto your bill at the end.  I would normally give them 4 stars because I like the place, but they get 5 at this location for one reason: My son left his retainers at the table, hidden in a napkin, and we didn't realize it until we were down the road a bit. We called them as soon as we could, but the table had been cleared. They held the trash can aside for us while we drove back and even helped my family go through the nasty trash in an attempt to locate the missing dental appliances.

Unfortunately, restaurant policy is that you cannot purchase a gift card with another gift card, so there was nothing to be done. I ended up rebuying the cards out of pocket.  Regardless: The manager, a friendly, classy man named Drew, provided me with about eight free app/dessert cards for my school in order to try to make up for it, and apologized profusely, while the bartender, a compassionate angel of a woman named Terri who ran around like a whirlwind taking care of orders, felt so badly over my out-of-pocket expense that she comped my malted milkshake.

All this is pretty much what I expect when I go to any Red Robin, some reason they are always slow.  What was really disgusting was the manager Katie came walking out of the kitchen with a mouth FULL of food pushing out a cart of glasses, wiped her mouth while continuing to chew and then without washing or using hand sanitizer she proceeded to empty the glass rack.

Next time I'll go to BJ's or even Chili's.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mesa,3.32,3.32,3.32,,3.3200000000000003
28,Darren P.,"Mesa, AZ",26,9,,1.0,2016-06-20,"Used to come here a lot, and yesterday I picked Red Robin since we haven't been here in a while and it was my Father's Day dinner selection.  The service was absolutely pathetic.  Had to remind my server several times for refills, food that was cold and boxes for our food. At first I thought we were in for a good meal with a good server at the start, but it turned horribly wrong.  We ordered the large stack of onion rings, got the small stack.  My wife had sweet potato fries that were cold and took forever to get her new fries.  The server wasn't gracious at all, and when the fries did come out he just handed them to my wife with no apologies.  He came to say he would refill our drinks and it took a reminder and 15 minutes before we got them.  At the end of the meal he promised boxes for our leftover food, took him 20 minutes to get our boxes.  He made an excuse of getting food for another table, well that is not our problem. Saw a person who was cleaning a table with a dirty dish rag, makes me wonder on how clean this establishment is, etc. Not sure if I will ever return to Red Robin any time soon.   Shame.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mesa?start=20,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006

After two successful weeks of school, she picked Red Robin to celebrate. There was a bit of a wait, but she went right up to him and stated that she would be having a cheeseburger, fries, and ketchup. When we got seated, he came to our table with exactly that. He had ordered it so she would eat right away! Awesome!!! He made sure she was taken care of. Jason, our waiter continued this exceptional customer service throughout our evening.

There was something clumpy/doughy in the clams chowder, the wedge salad was like it had been sitting around for a long while. We ask for fries that were cooked and we get hard over done ones, like trying to be wise.

34,Jessica D.,"Mesa, AZ",0,1,,1.0,2017-05-06,"This was the worst Red Robin dining experience I have had. We were sat in a section that had 4 dirty tables. By the end of the meal only one of the tables had been cleared. It was 10 minutes before Kenya, our server, acknowledged us. We requested fries to be brought out before our food but sadly the request went unmet. You couldn't say it was due to the server being busy because there were 3 servers working the section and only 5 tables occupied. Once the food arrived we requested additional steak fries seeing as how they never arrived before. They came once we finished our meal. Our drinks were never filled and she spilled my drink when she brought the first one. The food was decent but my burger was a mess. I couldn't even keep it in the bun due to all the sauce poured on it. There were 2 managers on duty but it was apparent, due to the condition of the restaurant, they had low standards so there was no point in discussing it. I love the Red Robin on Stapley!

We walked in, after about 15 seconds of the staff chatting with each other and completely ignoring us standing in front of them, the hostess very abruptly said ""you can just choose a seat in the bar."" Wow, no ""hello"", no ""welcome to Red Robin"", no greeting at ALL - and we didn't WANT to sit in the bar. We were there to eat a meal and wanted to sit at a table in the dining room. There was not a wait and many tables were available. Very lazy, dismissive, unwelcoming and quite frankly, really rude - suggest some intensive guest training with the front of the house staff.  Service at the table (Caleb?) was very good (and welcoming - in contrast to his colleagues manning the podium up front.)

Lovely to look at stacks of dirty dishes. -When our appetizer came we had to ask multiple times for silverware. Maybe because there were so many dirty tables there was no clean forks and knives. -It took some time for our food to arrive and when it did it was not even warm. I guess it was sitting in the window for awhile. We asked the food runner right away for more fries. First attempt. They never came. We told her our issue with the food temperature. No solution given. -It took even more time for our server to come back and check on us. We told her about our issue and asked for more fries. Second request. No response. -The hostess actually came over and checked on us and we told her our issue and asked for more fries. Third time was the charm. The fries finally came after we were all done eating. -Another server came over and spoke to us so we told her what was going on. She gave an excuse that our server had only been with the company for a week. Then why would you give the new server a party of at least 12 sitting by us.  -After speaking with four employees the manager never came over. They just don't care. Any time I've been to a restaurant with an issue a manager is usually right over to offer a solution.  -I guess we didn't want dessert because they never asked. Isn't it their job to upset us? The more they sell the more we tip. Hello? -Complete ruination of my wife's birthday dinner.
