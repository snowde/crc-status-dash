45,Scott C.,"Warwick, RI",47,268,50.0,1.0,2012-01-29,"We have given the Red Robin in Milbury a few different tries. The first time we went I got a Chicken Sandwich. Normally with sandwiches, I cut them in 1/2 and good thing I did. When I cut into my sandwich, it was completely raw in the center. I was disappointed with their response. It took forever to get me another sandwich and the manager didn't even come over to apologize or take the sandwich off the bill.  The next few times we went I decided to try the burgers since they have a great selection. But each of these times there were problems either the food took for ever or the food was cold when it came to the table, like the food was either sitting there for a while or the burgers weren't made fresh but cooked earlier.

We ordered the wings.  Good.  The milkshakes.  Good.  Aaaahh.  That tower of rings kept calling to us.  I asked this question to the waitress, "" are they the kind of onion rings that when you bite into them, the onion comes out completely?""  A fair question for a foodie to ask.  ""They are famous"", was the answer.  Once we got them, we realised it was famous for being a tower of s#t.  One bite, out came the soggy slice of onion and you are left with the fried carcass of the onion ring.  For 7 or 8 dollars, you bet I was mad. They advertise on the menu and on t.v how famous the burgers are.  Did you see the commercial for the $6.99 burger and all u can eat fries?  well, you don't see that in here.

The fries weren't really all that amazing either. Definitely frozen, definitely a notch below Ore-Ida. Strike two. Aaaaand the ketchup bottle was empty. Strike three. And I get it, RR is probably one of the companies who's making their servers bus and set up their own tables, but I feel like dinner is a big one they should be ready for.

The waitstaff needs some real mentoring here.  Our waitress was inattentive and rude and I understood that the dining room was full and it was busy but when I ask how much longer on the food when I have to flag you down to get a refill on my soda the correct answer isn't ""The kitchen's really busy and they keep screwing things up."" That should have been a sign to cancel our order and leave but we waited....and waited... it was about 40 minuted before we got our burgers and they were wrong. Not horribly wrong like they belonged to a different table just wrong enough that she had clearly screwed up entering the burgers into the POS system. When I told her they were both wrong she said I didn't ask for cheese and then took the burgers back. When they came out again it was clearly the same burgers just modified. The waitress had a real attitude problem when we told her things were wrong, I tried being polite but she barely listened to the problem before walking away. My friend just wanted a plain cheese burger, no fixings and he had lettuce, onion, relish, ketchup and pickles.  I ended up with the wrong cheese and microwave flavor and relish I didn't ask for as well. We asked for the manager and he seemed confused and distracted and was barely helpful. My friend got his new burger which you could tell they rush cooked poorly. I was starving so I suffered through half of my burger even though it was terrible. The manager did comp our food so we only had to pay for the sodas but the worst part was that the waitress never came by to see if the food was right after the last fix,or give any apology. She didn't have to take the blame but giving a general ""sorry about the mix up with your burgers, is everything correct now? Can I get you more fries?"" would have sufficed but she didn't come over and say a word to us and ninja'd over to the table to drop off the bill for the sodas. When you are working in the service industry you don't have to kiss your customer's butt but this was ridiculous.

Now, we were still hungry after our approximately 3 chips apiece, and I asked for more.  The waitress said no problem, and then didn't bring the chips out until we were halfway through with our meal.  She did not tell us that there was going to be a charge for them, and it was not worth arguing about because who wants to be the cheapskate arguing about $1.29 for more chips?  It was very annoying that the initial portion was not sufficient, and then the refill portion didn't appear until we were busy with our entrees.      The restaurant was very busy, and service was slow.  There were several times when the waitress stopped at the table next to us- a party of three, and did not check in with my party of five.  I will say that she was very nice and attentive when she did come by.   The girls all ordered corndogs, and were happy with their meals.  I tried out the new smoke and pepper burger, and my husband had the Whiskey River burger.  We were happy with our burgers, and finished them.  They were filling, and we did not need to eat much dinner tonight.  In terms of taste, we prefer Five Guys or Shake Shack for our burgers.   We probably won't return any time soon.  The last time we were here was around my birthday in September when I had a free burger coupon.  We had problems with my mother-in-law's order on that visit, and while the issues were addressed quickly, I'm afraid that it's two strikes too many for Red Robin.  The food isn't worth the crowds and slow service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-millbury?start=40,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.504,3.2000000000000006

The place was dead, but yet, it took our waiter, ""Chris"" 10 minutes to actually get to our table. We decided to order everything (two drinks, an appetizer and our two burgers) once he got there because we didn't want to order our drinks and have to wait 10 more minutes to get the rest of our order. Unfortunately, that didn't stop the whole night from becoming a clusterfuck of incompetence.  We waited 15 minutes for our drinks after we ordered them. I literally would look at the bar and see our drinks sitting there. The bar tender had to stop what she was doing and give us our drink because our waiter was clearly not going to give them to us. By the time we got our drinks, mine (are frozen cocktail) was melted, watery and gross. My boyfriend's beer was on the flat side.  It wasn't until after 8 did we get our appetizer, fried zucchini and it was the best thing we got to eat, unfortunately, they were greasy and we had no napkins or silverware, though we requested some from Chris twice (when we got our appetizer and when he followed up on us while we were eating it). We didn't get any until I got up, went to him and asked for a third time.  It was 8:36 when our waiter informed us that he ""forgot"" to put our food order in (we should have been getting our check by then!) and that it would be a few more minutes. Yeah, right. By few minutes, I guess he meant a half an hour because it was past 9 when we finally got our food. He apologized for the wait with the lame-ass excuse ""someone in the kitchen doesn't like me and didn't tell me the orders were up"" I'm like 100% sure it's the waiters' responsibility to keep track of their orders, not the back. Incompetence at its finest. Our food was cold, the buns were soggy. It was a shame because our burgers looked like they were cooked the way we wanted them, but seeing they were sitting around for 30+ minutes the heat ended up cooking them through. It was fucking gross and we ate maybe three bites because we were starving.  We had to flag him over to get our check. After a long day and having to deal with this incompetent fool, I was getting visibly pissed off. He quickly got our check, but when I gave him my card, rather than take it and run it, he goes to the CLEAN table next to ours and wipes it down like to pretend he's been so fucking busy or something, even though we saw him dicking around and picking at his fingers half of the night.  I can't believe we were out for three hours when we wanted to be out for only one.  If management is reading this : fire these useless, incompetent slackers. Maybe then you'll actually get some customers rather everyone going to the TGI Friday's across the street.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-millbury?start=40,2.96,2.96,2.96,2.436,2.96

84,K K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,10,1.0,1.0,2014-07-26,"Ordered take out twice - this review is a combo of both experiences: First time I ordered take out in June: My order was incorrectly filled and the ""endless"" fries ended up being exactly 12 fries to go with my burger. at least fill the box halfway! geez! I complained to guest relations who emailed back and said she spoke with the manager and assured me that extra training was being done to ensure the right order.  I went back today for takeout again wanting to give them a second chance, guess what? Wrong order .... Again!!  I asked for the Tavern Double cheese burger and they charged me for a regular cheeseburger and charged me for an extra patty. Wow so give me the wrong order and bill me extra for it? It wasn't that good (ever heard of seasoning?) and my wife's Chicken bruschetta burger was ehhh. At least I got 15 fries this time... wooohooo, partyyyyy!  Overall I can see why this place gets consistently poor reviews. The fact that the order was completely wrong was just another example of corporations like Red Robin spending millions on commercials about the quality of the food only to experience the lack of follow through on the delivery of that quality. I am told to call the restaurant but what are they going to do? Make me drive back and waste more time to fix the order they couldn't get right in the first place?  I could call and get my money back but I ate the food - that's not the issue. As a previous manager myself, I know that the standards set by corporate office are set for a reason, yet very rarely are they followed through these days as evidenced by the meal I received. I've learned a long time ago with restaurants like Red Robin that calling the store rarely brings change - just words. It's not about appeasement - it's about following through on the corporate standards to ensure that every patron gets the high quality product promised. Red Robin hs missed the mark twice and I for one will never go back and encourage others to not go either until corporations have respect for their patrons.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-millbury?start=60,3.12,3.12,3.12,2.34,3.1200000000000006

22,Christine H.,"Westborough, MA",63,177,32.0,2.0,2016-02-28,"There is nothing ""gourmet"" about their burgers. It never ceases to amaze me how much crappy quality food/drinks can stick these adjectives in their business names/advertising and get away with it. Sauces are bland, cheeses don't taste like much, and buns are garden variety dry and tasteless. Tiny burgers, not cooked correctly (dry as hell) and the portions are tiny. For 11 bucks, I can buy 1.5 pounds of meat and appropriate burger accoutrements that taste better and feed about 6 people. Heck, potatoes for french fries are pretty cheap, too. In other words - rip-off. Total rip-off. The servers seem to be well-trained and the amount of milkshake you get is no joke.

20,Jim H.,"Marlborough, MA",68,99,9.0,3.0,2016-08-18,"Red Robin has been a staple for myself and my wife whenever we're in the mood for burgers. This place really knows how to make them. For the most part their food is great, the garlic fries are delicious, and the atmosphere is wonderful.  Each time we've been there, the waitstaff has been absolutely a joy to deal with and really friendly.  So why then the three stars? Well... First off all, every single time we've been to this place, whenever we get our fries refilled, we NEVER get the same fries back. Instead of more garlic fries, we get plain fries. Well we send them back, and get what we ordered, which is fine, it comes back without issue. So it's a minor issue.  My main issue that takes two stars away from this place are when they try to 'experiment.' What I mean by that is that they try to create new burgers using ingredients that you normally wouldn't see. These are really hit or miss... and unfortunately more miss than anything. After two bad burgers, I just order off the normal menu now.  So which burgers were they? Habanero Burger: Okay, I'm not a wuss when it comes to hot. I have a bottle of something called Satan's Blood at home, a drop of which would make most people pass out. That being said, if you're going to cook hot food, you need to know exactly how hot to make something. This burger is made with jalapenos, and a Habanero paste as the sauce. The burger is so hot that it has no flavor. The heat is way too overpowering. It's not intolerably hot, it's just like you get the blast of heat and then no taste to it. Needless to say, I'm not ordering that again.  Then I tried the Ramen burger... Oh man... the Ramen burger... All right, so this is a burger where bun is made from cooked noodles that appear to be mixed with a bit of egg, pressed into a bun shape, and then cooked. The burger itself is topped with Teriyaki and Chiu Chow aioli, fried jalapeño coins, chili-infused shredded cabbage, carrot and onion and fresh basil for garnish.Sounds great right?  Like most of us who went to college, I was on a Ramen diet for a few years... and I'm still seeing a doctor about it! ;)  Anyway, I thought I'd give this a try to relive some nostalgia and try something new like I always do. This burger was NASTY!!!! The crisp outside of the bun hid overly moist noodles... too moist, and lacking in any real flavor. The blandness even overpowered the burger and it's toppings.  If that wasn't bad enough, I came down with a stomach ache soon after I ate it.  In Summation, the food here is great, just try to avoid the burgers where they try something new. It hasn't worked out very well and thankfully, it appears that these burgers are no longer on their menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-millbury?start=20,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005
14,Chris g.,"Spencer, MA",32,25,,3.0,2016-08-28,"So, let's start with the food. It was all good. My burger was cooked perfectly, and was exactly what I was looking for. My wife's was as well. My daughter's Mac and cheese was a little light on the quantity of Mac and cheese, but the quality was there. Where the restaurant loses two stars is the service, and the management. First of all, I understand a kitchen can be slow. When that happens, it's the front of the house's job to make up for it. My waitress was slow. Drink refills took forever. Bottomless drinks can only be bottomless if someone comes back to check on them. Same is true of never ending French fries. If you never come back, that's an empty promise. I think a large part of this falls on management. When we were leaving, there were several people waiting to be seated, a gaggle of wait staff and hostesses at the front door, and a dozen or more open tables. If I'm the manager, I'm sitting these people, pulling those waiters off the front desk, and adding an extra staff to the bar. That's a whole lot of missed drinking going on.

I am a huge fan of their Smoke & Pepper burger.  I hope they never take it off the menu.  The hamburger meat on all their sandwiches is excellent.  They clearly season the meat and cook it correctly whenever we go.  I am also a huge fan of the bottomless fries and drinks.

6,E T.,"West Hollywood, CA",28,453,164.0,2.0,2017-06-17,"I remember seeing all the ads on television when Red Robin started to break into the New England market from it's Midwest stronghold. At one time I remember there was an hour wait to get a table for the first 6 months any Red Robin opened. Then came Burger Fi, Five Guys, Smash Burger, Walbergers, Crunch Burger, Unami Burger ... You get the idea. Foodies jumped the burger bandwagon as they did with grilled cheese, Pho and cronuts. The attention span of a foodie is a couple of go arounds of the old goldfish bowl before Cola Marinated Pork Bahn Mi, Vietnamese Lettuce Cups and truffle fries and all the other 'hot items' go in and come out in less than a year's time. Cue poor Red Robin who jumped into the burger revolution with both feet only to realize the pool was slowly draining. Cut to the interior of Red Robin in Millbury, MA. The bar has a couple hipsters fresh off their shift at Nordstrom Rack or Pier One. A small handful of families and teens scatter the cavernous dining space. Yep ... No hour wait here unless you are talking post Black Friday Christmas shopping. The burgers here are no better or worse than you'd find at Denny's or TGIFridays or Applebee's. It's a greasy 75/25 Burger mix ... Packaged grocery store style buns ... Barely any seasoning (the secret to Shake Shack's success is dredging their burgers in salt and pepper seasoning). My lettuce was wilty and blah. They forgot to put mustard and mayo on the burger. It was the least memorable part of my meal and the too thick tomato slice made the burger a runny mess. The milkshake was pathetic. A barely blended mess with the bottom full of giant pieces of Oreos and the top a melty vanilla ice cream. The best shake in the business belongs to Chick Filet. The worst ... Red Robin. I'd seriously rather have a Mcflurry than the glass of broken cookies and runny too sweet ice cream at Red Robin. The best part of the meal was the fries. Unlimited steak fries ... I ate more than I should of because the main parts of my meal sucked so bad. The fries were crispy but my guess is whoever was supposed to season the food was on break while I was there because they were bland like cardboard until I drenched them in Heinz ketchup. They played odd 1980s music ... Not even the upbeat stuff though. It was more a melancholy mix of Cindi Lauper's slow songs, Areosmith love ballads and other sad songs you'd want to hear more during a slow dance at a prom than a sadly empty burger joint on a Saturday night. For families who want a burger and fries for the kids after shopping or for teens who need a spot to grab a $12 burger before seeing a movie next door ... This will do the trick. However all else will leave feeling worse than when they came in. That's the worst kind of burger, the kind where the thought of ordering it is the most satisfying part of eating it.
