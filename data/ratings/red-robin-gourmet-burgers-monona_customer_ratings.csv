67,J F.,"Madison, WI",0,45,2.0,3.0,2012-01-13,"Brought the wife and kids here on a Sunday night.  We were seated within 5 minutes or so.   Although the lobby was empty, it turned out nearly all of the tables in the dining room were full. As another reviewer said, this place feels loud and chaotic, even on a Sunday night.  It was difficult for the waiter to hear my wife and kids' orders; it seriously felt like a school cafeteria (noise-wise). Not relaxing at all; I cant imagine what it sounds like on a Friday or Saturday night. The acoustics just aren't good in here; maybe carpet and/or a different booth layout would help. Food was good and reasonably priced.  Came out pretty quickly. Server did a pretty good job, but seemed a little stressed out like he had too many tables. I might come back, but I really don't look forward to all the noise.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monona?start=40,2.1879999999999997,2.1879999999999997,2.1879999999999997,2.1879999999999997,2.1879999999999997
64,Kevin S.,"Cross Plains, WI",17,14,9.0,2.0,2012-01-29,"Staff was very young and lacked a sense of professionalism on any level and it was obvious there is a lack of leadership.   Was a busy evening, the wait was reasonable though at about 15 minutes for three of us. Shortly after being seated a young guest at another booth got sick on the floor.  Our server, who was taking our order, immediately made a big dramatic scene about how she couldn't see stuff like that and ran off to the back. We then watched no less than 10 staff (not an exaggeration) walk by/over/around the prominent mess with no effort given to cleaning it up or acknowledgement to the guests around it.  Finally a young man with a mop bucket full of dirty kitchen water showed up to mop up the mess...  No thought given to the fact that it's a biohazard in a restaurant and obviously having no training in how to handle the situation. He then parked the mop bucket in the dining room next to us (splashing the disgusting mix onto the wall) while having a loud conversation with another staff member about it.  He came back a few minutes later with a bucket of pungent bleach water and towel to hand wipe the floor and, using the same cloth, the seats and table top.   Our server did eventually come back and let us know that she did put our order in.  Another server then stopped by to tell us how it reminded her of a scene in a movie where a bunch of kids puked after trying tobacco chew... I really can't make this up.  It was an experience that I will never forget. The food?  My burger was average, but not bad and my wife's clam strips were inoffensive but rather flavorless.  Our daughters spaghetti was predictably bland.

59,Steven L.,"Madison, WI",87,75,13.0,2.0,2012-12-12,"Let's go to red robin they said.  They have really good burgers they said.  So I went there and got a bacon cheddar burger.  The waitress asked if I would like some pink or no pink.  I replied medium-rare (because beef is cooked rare, medium rare, medium, medium well, or well done).  Her reply was of course, not a problem.  We can get a lot of pink for ya.  Apparently the message got lost in the kitchen as my medium-rare burger arrived very well done and charred to a crisp with dark brown meat throughout the center and black meat (carbon) on the edge.   If a burger place cannot distinguish between very well done and medium rare, they suck.   I'll give them one extra star for serving hot french fries, though they were very bland. Crappy burgers, a front of house not communicating with the back of house, and bland fries.  Definitely not coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monona?start=40,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152,2.152

56,Lisa M.,"Madison, WI",15,42,,3.0,2013-12-09,"So I recall hearing a story on NPR about a reviewer in LA who reviewed all the restaurants on one particular street. It took a couple years because of the diversity and number of places on that street, but eventually he got to all of them. That sounded like a fun project to undertake, so I thought I'd do the same. Picking which street in Madison was kind of difficult, especially since you can stay driving on the same road and it'll change names like 4 or 5 times. I decided to pick one such road: Monona Dr which turns into Attwood Ave, which turns into Willy Street. There are so many great places on this road, some of which are already favorites, but others that I need to get around to visiting and reviewing. Now the journey begins.... It was a snowy December Sunday afternoon when I visited this Red Robin. The snow kept a lot of people away, but the place was still about a third filled. I was greeted and seated promptly. I've been to Red Robins before and I like to think of them as an easy place to go when my sister is in town visiting with her kids. Kids seem welcome here (they even can get a balloon) and since it's already a loud place, I don't mind when my niece and nephew act up (to say I'm not a kid person would be a great understatement). The burgers here are good with fun toppings. My go to is the A1 peppercorn burger which may rival Bob's Bad Breath Burger from the Weary Traveler when it comes to giving you bad breath afterwards. The onion bun along with the crispy onions on top definitely leaves you reaching for some gum after dinner. If you are feeling gluttonous, the never ending refills of steak fries can fill you up. When they are fresh and hot, they are pretty tasty, but if you are looking for crispy fries, this isn't the place for you. They had some boozy ice cream shakes on the menu that looked interesting, but I'm not in the mood for shakes in winter. Overall it's a decent place for burgers and fries if you don't mind that it's loud, there's tons of pop culture crap all over the walls, and that it's a chain. A solid 3 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monona?start=40,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997
37,Jen G.,"McFarland, WI",21,9,,1.0,2013-12-09,"I had not taken my family to RR in quite some time.  Everyone was in the mood for burgers so it seemed like a good fit for a relatively inexpensive Friday night dinner.  Pulling in the parking lot I was surprised at the lack of business - that should have been my first clue.  We were seated promptly and our drink order was taken.  Then we waited.  And waited.  Finally our drinks arrived and our order was taken.  We ordered a small appetizer and bowl of soup with our meals.  Again, we waited.  Our appetizer finally arrived - but no soup.  It was mediocre, and sadly, the best food we would have that evening. Our entrees arrived shortly after.  It was then my husband asked if he could have his bowl of soup.  Soon after the waitress arrived with a half filled bowl.  It almost looked as though it had been full at one point, then dumped out. The fries were cold on all our meals.  The burger I ordered well done, was extremely pink. I did not bother to ask for it to be corrected because at this point the whole experience was quite laughable.  More than halfway through our entrees, a gentlemen in what appeared to be a manager's uniform, came to the table with a bowl of soup asking if it was ours.  My husband laughed and told him, ""No, I already got this half full bowl."" A few moments later I bit into something hard, like bone, in my burger.  At that point I was disgusted - and done.  I would have told the waitress that the food (and service) was awful, but we were never asked.  When she brought the bill she said she had taken the soup off the bill since it was only a 1/2 bowl.  So my husband's comment must have at least made it back to her, yet there was no apology for it, nor the fact that he had to ask for it and received it after his entrée. $58.00 for 3 people, lackluster/slow service and terrible food?  No thanks RR.  We won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monona?start=20,1.956,1.956,1.956,1.956,1.956
43,Christine Z.,"Madison, WI",0,4,,1.0,2013-12-28,"Not sure what is going on with this Red Robin location. We live in Monona so it's the closest and used to be dependably good food and service. Stopped in before Christmas, snow coming in and they were not busy.  Lots of servers.  Sat down to order and our waitress took our drink order, came back with it and told her we needed a couple more minutes to decide on our order.  She never came back, I could see her behind the bar talking to the other servers, she wasn't busy.  After about a half hour another server who seemed to have quite a few tables stopped by and asked if we were ok, I said no, we didn't seem to have a server.  She took care of our table, seemed to try to talk to the manager about what was going on but he looked pretty disinterested.  After we ordered our food our original server showed up, apologized and told me she had gotten busy behind the bar, honestly, lying is not the best policy, telling me she forgot would have worked better with me.  At the end we tipped the server that actually helped us and did not leave a tip for the no-show server. Couple of other things, the bottomless fries are now a few fries in a little basket.  Talked to some other locals and one had food served with wrappers from food products in her food.  Other problems were mentioned, this location seems to be struggling.  This could just be the Monona location or maybe Red Robins in general?  We haven't checked out the East Towne location.  This is too bad they typically had good, reliable food, priced pretty well. I don't leave bad reviews for restaurants that are not great but this was a ridiculous experience considering there was no one in the restaurant.  Be interested to see if I hear anything back from the review, will post if I do.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monona?start=60,1.988,1.988,1.988,1.988,1.988

29,Kyara M.,"Austin, TX",53,143,151.0,3.0,2014-06-04,"Red Robin is a good place if you want a hamburger that's a step above your typical fast food drive up joint. They are similar to Culvers but doesn't offer you that ""home quality"" kind of experience.  I typically get the Bleu Ribbon with some pink. I like the fried onion straws they add to the burger as well as this chipotle spread they use after toasting their buns. Mix that with the burger, BBQ sauce and bleu cheese and you've got a great tasting large juicy burger. I sometimes have to cut it in half because it's hard to take a bite out of. The burger comes with a side of endless steak fries they are often cooked to perfection. They are one of the few places that offers onion rings, however, as much as I love me some rings, I do not care much for theirs. The onions they use are extremely thick making it hard to bit into. I have often times ended up just eating the breading and putting the onions to the side. They are onion rings! This doesn't make any sense! They need to slice their onions thinner. As of now, I do not believe they are editable.  My other negative is presentation. The Bleu Ribbon has a lot going on so I realized that sometimes the burger can get messy. However, there have been times where my burger has come out looking like it went through a tornado. Lettuce falling everyone, too much BBW sauce, bleu cheese thrown on. The presentation needs to get better. I've experienced this at two different Red Robins. Also, I've also noticed that within the last year, they've cut back on the amount of steak fries they give you. Since they are bottomless it makes really no difference but I've definitely seen a change.  That being said, I would rate Red Robbi as being more than just an ""A-OK"" burger joint but they are far from a ""4+ star"" quality kind of joint. I do like the atmosphere. They have a few game machines, TV's, bar, background music and great classic pictures hanging on the walls that are great for helping to start a conversation ( say you're on a first date?). The art and photography they use to decorate the place I believe adds a lot of character and ""spunk"".  They do get very busy on weekends so expect a wait for a table and for your food but from my experience, it has never been extremely long. Wait staff has been good for me as well.  Overall, they are a solid burger place. A bit pricey but I do think they are good.  Oh, one more thing, if you're dieting,....The Bleu Ribbon is 1,001 calories and fries are close to 500 calories!!! (According to my ""Lose it!"" app - they could be wrong but I also believe this is an extremely high calorie meal)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monona?start=20,2.32,2.32,2.32,2.38,2.32
33,Matthew R.,"Madison, WI",4,2,,1.0,2014-06-29,"If I could have given today's experience negative stars, I would have. The food was average. Nothing beyond what you can get anywhere else in this city. What takes places like this to another level is the service and the ambiance. This is what took Red Robin straight into the toilet. From the moment we walked in, this place felt different. I've been here off and on for years, but there was a weird vibe in the air. I knew it was going to be a memorable visit after the hostess asked if we were ""going to need a high chair for that?"" while gesturing at our 9 month old daughter. We were seated fairly quickly, which was nice, and our server seemed average, didn't tell us about anything new, didn't ask us if it was our first time at Red Robin (usually they do, and it wasn't, but still, try a little), and didn't bring us any silverware or napkins. Took our drink order, took our order, and left. She knew we had a baby with us, and knew that she had just taken an order from the table of 8 behind us, and didn't bother to consider bringing the fruit cup for our daughter or my wife and I a basket of fries ahead of time since we'd be waiting a bit due to the large ticket in queue ahead of us. She didn't even bother checking on our drink situations in the meantime. Just went all ghost and ignored us. In this meantime, my wife and I are entertaining our daughter and looking and watching around us. She notices the manager checking in with other tables and rolling her eyes a bit after a few exchanges with customers. I notice a few scoffs and eye-rolls among the staff, and start to get bothered by how the staff is acting like this job is beneath them. Another server brings us our food. I had asked for a side of sauce that doesn't show up, but she gets it promptly. I had asked for no tomato on the burger, but was talked over so she must not have heard it. No big deal. We go to serve some fruit to our daughter, but we still don't have any silverware or napkins, so we ask and some are brought reasonably promptly. And set right in front of our 9 month old daughter. Not the brightest of plans to set metal forks and knives in front of any small child, but especially one who is currently fussing a bit at not having any food. At no point does the manager come by to check on us. Our server barely says another word to us after handing us the bill. They coasted this entire time, why did I expect them to suddenly make any effort? Because I thought they would want us to come back. I'm of the belief that if you think your job is beneath you, then you should prove it. You never know who is watching or who you're serving, and who may be able to help you get out of the job that you don't really like. I mean, there are so many places to get a mediocre burger, you may as well offer above and beyond service to make it stand out. I guess when even the manager is rolling her eyes at customers, the rest of the staff begins to believe that kind of behavior is acceptable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monona?start=20,2.28,2.28,2.28,2.116,2.28

23,Beth L.,"Drumod, Republic of Ireland",156,19,6.0,5.0,2015-10-08,"We happened to be in Monona and we were looking for a place to eat.  We normally grab lunch or dinner at the Noodles & Co. there, but I didn't want to for a few reasons (I wanted more food for my buck and I wanted to sit with ""normal"" people in a COMFORTABLE atmosphere), so we decided to try Red Robin.  None of us had ever been there.  It was me, my boyfriend and our 8-year-old daughter.   Boy were we surprised!  Not only is it a very family-friendly atmosphere, but it's just a fun place in general (no matter your age).  We enjoyed the tablet at our table (could be used to order drinks, appetizers or desserts, as well as to pay your bill, join their rewards club and to play games), even though we were charged a $2 entertainment fee, because our daughter played games (still, it was great to be able to sit there and talk as adults and enjoy our meal while she was entertained).   Our food was excellent.  I normally don't like ""pub fries"", which is what I think of when I see the fries they offer, so I was unsure about the bottomless fries, but I ordered a burger (the Black & Bleu) and I upgraded my bottomless fries for 99 cents to the Garlic Parmesan Fries and got the garlic dipping sauce for the fries.  They were amazing and I did get a second helping of them (second batch was double the size of the first).  I ate every last bit of my meal.  It was excellent. My daughter was thrilled with her choices.  She also has bottomless fries, their corndog bites and a chocolate milk shake.  All-in-all, I will definitely be visiting Red Robin again.  It's a new favorite!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monona?start=20,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.388,2.44

Came during lunch on a Tuesday and was seated immediately. Unfortunately I was seated at the corner and server did not know I was there for a long while. They have a new table side system that you can call for the server, and I pressed the button - still no server. I think the server calling system simply changes the light on top of the unit to red so if no one saw it, no one knows you are there. I was about to leave when the server came over and apologizes with a ""you sneaked passed me  ..."" joke. No - I was seated by another staff - did not snuck in. Anyway, the rating is for the food. Ordered the DGB burger with french onion soup and it was good. Juicy inside and sauce is tasty. The French onion soup is OK. onions, beef broth, bread and cheese baked in an oven. Oh - i did not know when he said fries or soup, choosing soup adds an extra cost to the bill. The table side system also allows you to check out quickly with a credit card. While I like the efficiency of these systems, I find that it takes away the service part of a restaurant. I can order and pay right from there - so maybe I don't have to tip that much since all the servers do is to give me water and bring out my food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-monona,2.36,2.36,2.36,2.2800000000000002,2.36

Decent burger at a ok price.  I have no interest in the so called gourmet burgers with a bunch of saucy stuff on them. I would be interested in a grass fed burger; although I'd be skeptical it was actually true if they had one.  Others at the table got a salad thing, and the chicken caesar wrap. Both looked ok and where what you would expect from a chain, pull the chicken out of the bag and microwave. Or do you microwave in the bag and then open?  There was some screen thingy on the table.  The kind of cool options were a 'call the waiter' button and the option to pay via the thing.  But be aware if you pay with the screen your probably not getting a receipt. It has the option to print one but the thing is small and clearly does not hold much paper. Ours was out of paper.  You can pay two dollars to play tap games on the screen thing. Meh.

You get a free burger with the purchase of 10 burgers (doesn't have to be simultaneous) and a free burger on your birthday. A single burger here will run you over 1,000 calories. That's because they sear the bun in margarine and most burgers will come with mayo. I usually get the Bonzai burger without margarine, mayo and cheese and the damage is usually limited to around 670 calories. The burgers are fire grilled and I suppose you can taste some kind of char, but the patties are otherwise unremarkable.

It was a complete waste of money and for two days I regretted going there and spending my hard-earned cash on their overpriced food. Furthermore, I understand that there's a full bar here and everything but the waiters should not be drinking. One of the waiters, who wasn't even mine, came over to my table and started talking in slurred language.

Objectively speaking this is neither bad nor good. But what pushed me to the edge was not the food or the customer experience, but the value of what you're paying for. The food was good and the waitress I had was very pleasant, but the strange part was the portions and pricing comparison. The food you get and the price you pay don't add up whatsoever. A burger and fries alone could be $15.99 like what mine was. If they were going to rob me I'd prefer they do it at gun point. The burger I received was VERY small and the only thing that remotely satisfied me in the end was the endless fries. But I can speak for a lot of people when I say most people don't go to Red Robin for fries. Overall, pleasant experience just not worth the value. Slapping the word ""gourmet"" on it doesn't justify paying that price. If it doesn't bother you, then by all means eat there.
