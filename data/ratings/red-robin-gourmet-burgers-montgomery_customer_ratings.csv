Some bartenders and wait staff act like they don't understand that their tip is related to their service and attitude. A simple ""Hi"" when someone sits down (as opposed to looking up from washing glasses, seeing me sitting there, and then just looking back down again) goes a long way.

48,Rustin L.,"Papillion, NE",94,114,51.0,2.0,2013-09-07,"So...it's Red Robin.  It's a national chain at which I've eaten in probably six or seven states across the country. What I mean to say is that there's a level of expectation for a chain that this one DID NOT meet. First it took too long to get seated when there was no rush, plenty of tables, no waiting list, and no one waiting to say Hello at the door (as per every other Red Robin). When we were finally seated, we were crowded into a small section with a bunch of other customers (no necessary) and the wait for service was HORRIBLE. I felt like we were forgotten. And once the order went it, it took way too long for the burgers to come out. Of note, and this applies to many Red Robins, when I ask for a basket of free fries when I place my first drink order, I expect it to show up right after we order our entrees, NOT AFTER when receive our burgers that have fries in the basket already.

52,Asia W.,"Montgomery, AL",0,2,,1.0,2015-04-28,"My boyfriend and I had dinner here last night and I am thoroughly disappointed. This was my second time coming here in about 8 years or so. My first visit was pleasant from what I can remember. But last night's service was just god awful. For one, it took 10 minutes for us to put in a drink order. I got the Spanish Red Sangria (delish!) and my boyfriend got a double Crown NEAT (no ice, no nothin') and a Dr. Pepper on the side. It took about another 15 minutes for us to receive our drinks (keep in mind that this was a Monday night, not a Friday or Saturday night) and when they did finally arrive, his double Crown was on the rocks (apparently the bartender doesn't know what NEAT means). At that point, we were already pissed off and didn't want to waste time sending it back. Now, for the waiter. I don't know what this dude's problem was, but he made me feel very uncomfortable. For one, he got all in our faces when we ordered our drinks and food. By that, I mean that he crouched down, put his elbows on the table and was about 2 damn inches from our face. I backed away and he just kinda got closer, my boyfriend was not amused, nor was I. When he came to take our food order, he got extremely close to me, putting his elbows on the table and getting in my space. I had to kinda lean over to the inside of the booth so he wasn't so close to my face. When he finally brought our food 30 minutes after ordering, he asked us if we looked at the Rewards Program. I told him that I had signed up for it and he asks for my number (by this point my boyfriend is fuming and says ""No, you can't have her number, dude"") and I tell him that I have the code that was texted to me. He was like, ""oh, yeah, the code. Let me write that down"". Very inappropriate. The food was excellent, don't get me wrong, but the service that we experienced was just terrible. I don't think it's appropriate for a waiter to crouch down and be at face level when taking your order, at all. Not everyone likes to have their space invaded. Probably won't be returning to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-montgomery?start=40,2.76,2.76,2.76,1.7000000000000002,2.76

However, the RR here in Montgomery has issues.  I've lived in town for about three years, and I've been to this location A myriad of times. The last six months, however, something has changed at this restaurant. Every server seems like they hate their job. Service is not good.  My last two trips here have been less than impressive. On our most recent visit, we ordered a short stack of onion rings as an appetizer. They came out after our burgers. At one point, I saw a server walking towards us with our short stack of onion rings, looking confused. I guess he decided he didn't know where the order was supposed to go, so he turned around and went back to the kitchen. They did not come out for another 10 minutes.  Our server was not very attentive. Whatever has happened at this location, has to be management related. Kind of sad. Can I just add a personal note? I absolutely hate that these restaurants have gone to the little electronic console at the tables. Part of what I tip you for is for you to take my card from me, run it, and return it.

The restaurant seemed clean overall, however the bathroom shows this location's age.  Bathroom could definitely benefit from a makeover.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-montgomery,2.0,2.0,2.0,,2.0

My food was some what burned and no refilled on drinks. The waiter made sure we knew how to operate table top computer to pay the bill and then just walked away! We did see him finally as we were going out door! Staff were on phones and talking to each other in back. Couldn't get service and the place was empty on Monday night. Red Robin has lost my business and hope they lose yours as well!

30,Wendy K.,"Wetumpka, AL",10,10,13.0,2.0,2016-09-03,I'm very disappointed and quite surprised that the ramen burger tasted like it was cooked in urine. I had to return it and they gave me my money back. They offered something else but I was afraid to get anything else. I'm unsure if it was the sauce or the ramen itself but I asked our friend and my daughters and they said it smelled and tasted funny as well. I probably won't return now. That used to be one of my fav places to go. Also they didn't serve the fries in the chrome cups like before. I also asked for an Irish cream shake and the waitress had to come back 3 times to ask me what it was and how much it was. Then the bartender has to come and ask me for another time which one I wanted the stout shake or Irish cream and I was confused. Anyways when he filled the stout shake as it sounded better to me I couldn't taste any alcohol. It was like a regular milkshake lol! I'm going to try to make a ramen burger at home just to see if it tastes funny like it did there. I'll be pretty shocked if not.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-montgomery?start=20,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08

29,H C.,"Vienna, VA",1,39,15.0,2.0,2016-11-21,"I recently went there over the weekend. I order two burgers--one for dine in and one to go.  The burger I had for dining in was slightly over cooked. The burger I had to go was also over cooked and inedible. I don't know what they put on my to go order, but it tasted like bleach. After I bit into it and it tasted like bleach, I threw it away.  I live almost 2 hours from the nearest Red Robin, and was quite disappointed the burger I was excited to have at home wasn't even edible.  The facility was dirty. The bathroom sink was draining into a bucket. The bathrooms were worse than most truck stops.  The server was friendly, but not attentive. It wasn't busy when we went-maybe 4 families in there for dining in.  The staff was having a dance 'party' in the back, which was just not the atmosphere for it.  Overall this was and is not a place I would trust to eat at again. I'm actually quite disappointed the management has let this facility be run so poorly. The one in Panama City has much better food and staff. Either way, I'm done with Red Robin; this experience ruined it for me for good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-montgomery?start=20,1.92,1.92,1.92,,1.92

I remember coming to Red Robin's when I was a child and it was delicious. Was looking for a place to treat my girlfriend to while she was in town and I decided to stop here. Was immediately sat down, and served. The waitress was kind even when we was taking our time picking out some food to eat. The food took no less than 10 minutes to arrive at our table. The food, I must say was delicious. We both ordered chicken tenders and fries and it was out of this world. The chicken tenders were delicious, the fries were delicious but the coke I got wasn't all that. But overall, everything was great.

15,Andrew W.,"Oklahoma City, OK",0,7,,2.0,2017-07-27,Prime rib dip pricey. Average at best. Not worth $4 more than a burger. Unlimited fries is a relative term.
