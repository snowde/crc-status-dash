3,Dan B.,"Statesville, NC",0,22,,1.0,2013-05-30,"Stopped at the Red Robin tonight for a dinner with my daughter. Arrived about 6:30pm and was greeted by 2 pleasant hosts and seated. We looked thru the menu and waited on a server. And waited. And waited. And waited some more. Several times a manager named Jay strolled by but never once asked how we were doing. After 15 mins of no server we headed out the door. On our way the same pleasant hostess said "" thanks for coming by!""  I said ""nothing to thank me for, I never got waited on.""  She made no attempt to solve the issue. Long and short is I have no idea on the food since I never got any. But if that is the service? No thank you. Plenty of places to get over priced burgers",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mooresville?start=20,3.0760000000000005,3.0760000000000005,3.0760000000000005,3.0760000000000005,3.076000000000001
6,Greg P.,"Mooresville, NC",0,18,1.0,4.0,2013-10-05,Great service at this location. The wait staff seemed genuinely pleased to have customers! Red Robin's prices are a tad high but we enjoy the experience and the local staff can't control the prices.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mooresville?start=20,,,,,
27,Cody G.,"Clarksville, TN",5,3,,1.0,2013-10-22,Been a while since coming here. Me and my wife came for a late lunch. Was greeted by one girl that seemed to be doing everything while the other sat on their butts. We waited a good 10 minutes without any acknowledgment that we were there. To a point where we left and went to chilis next door.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mooresville,,,,,
2,Kevin B.,"Bath, PA",1,1,,1.0,2014-05-18,"As I sit here and wait for my check I may say one of my worst dining experiences ever. Took almost an hour for kids meals, which were ordered almost 20 minutes before adult entrees,  then had to send them back because they were cold and over cooked. Asked for bacon aioli imagine my surprise when they gave me some spicy aioli. Just a terrible experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mooresville?start=20,,,,,
15,Bill W.,"Cornelius, NC",5000,848,12319.0,3.0,2014-07-05,"Not Great but Still an Upscale Burger Been awhile since I've been here so I decided to see if there was anything new. Couple of new items on the menu and a good portion of it appears to be getting away from burgers and to more healthy fare. That said, I still opted for a A-! Peppercorn Burger cooked medium ( they won't let me order medium rare). Burger was very good and the endless fries were great.  Properly cooked for a medium and nice and juicy and not dried out.  Toppings were generous and all in all, a very good offering. Service was great and the atmosphere was not bad either . Somewhat whimsical so at least someone has a sense of humor. Bit pricy but you get what you pay for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mooresville,,,,,
22,Nicholas S.,"Charlotte, NC",408,142,105.0,1.0,2014-08-23,"It's very seldom I give a 1 star review. And I never do it unless I've given them sufficient chances. But, enough is enough. Heed mine and other Yelpers' warnings. Do NOT go to this Red Robin Gourmet Burgers.  I will tell you about my most recently experience, but it accurately represents all three experiences I've had going to this Red Robin in Mooresville.  They sat us at our table and told us our server would be with us soon. Our family was having a good time and great conversation and time quickly passed. At some point I paused and realized our server had still not came to our table. Upon checking the time, I realized we had sat there 30 minutes without even being acknowledged. The table next to us was empty when we got there, but had already been served their food by this point.  We grabbed one of the servers and explained the situation. Instead of giving our irritated party an experienced server who would know how to deal with the situation, the manager thought it was a good idea to send in someone who had just finished training that day. Granted he was very nice and tried his best, he frequently said inappropriate things like telling my mother that we waited so long because we came on a Friday. Not an excuse.  After ordering, we waited another 45 minutes for our food. You'd think they'd push our order through early. After we got our food, the server never came back to ask if we need refills on our drinks or bottomless sides.  On top of this, they gave me the wrong burger, but I didn't say anything. It just didn't seem worth it. The manager had already comped our meal. What else could they do other than waste more time?  Finally, we decided to get dessert even though we still hadn't seen our server. This was probably a mistake on our part. We grabbed a dessert menu from a nearby table and looked it over. Finally the server came by, looked directly at the dessert menu, said nothing about dessert and handed us our checks. We informed him we wanted dessert and proceeded to wait another 30 minutes for just two desserts.  Needless to say, we will NEVER go back to the Red Robin again. It's unfortunate because Red Robin has really good burgers, but the management at this place needs to be completely replaced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mooresville,,,,,

19,Scotty S.,"Concord, NC",103,173,360.0,4.0,2015-03-06,One can never go wrong when ordering a when craving a burger from Red Robin. Add in the bottomless fries and you're in heaven.  It has been a while since I've eaten at Red Robin and I wasn't disappointed. Their burgers are always cooked perfectly and they're very moist.  I'm an absolute fan of Red Robin's burgers.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mooresville,,,,,
21,Sean C.,"Davidson, NC",73,98,478.0,4.0,2015-06-04,"Love the banzai burger! Over the last year or two I have seen, at this location, a better overall product. Their service is good and they have presented the food in a nicer way. So they got rid of the paper wrapped burger look and started to put the French fries in a steel cone. Much nicer. They always have bottomless fries that we tend to stuff with our leftovers.  They reheat well. Of course, the ""gourmet burgers"" have always been on the pricier side, but we keep the ticket down by getting waters.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mooresville,,,,,

18,Brian R.,"Statesville, NC",1,5,1.0,5.0,2015-11-01,"The wife and I tried Red Robin for the first time Friday night an we were not disappointed. Everyone was very nice and friendly. Our waitress Tori was very good at her job. Usually you have to ask for a refill or wait for your server to come around to get a refill but not with her she was on top of everything, every time she came by she would make sure everything was ok and taste good. It's very rare now a days  to have a server who cares as much as she did. As for the food excellent I know they're known for the burgers but the sea food platter I ordered was great. You get two pieces of cod fish, shrimp, clamp strips witch was surprisingly good, and slaw not to mention the awesome bottomless fires. The next time we get a chance to have a date night we will return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mooresville,,,,,
23,Robin Y.,"Maiden, NC",18,1,1.0,5.0,2015-11-29,Great place to get a gluten-free burger and fries! My 10 year old and I are both gluten-free.

17,Jessica S.,"Mooresville, NC",39,24,8.0,5.0,2016-02-06,"I absolutely love Red Robin. This is our go to burger place! I've never had a bad meal here! Absolutely love the Whiskey River BBQ burger, the Tavern double, Guacamole Bacon Burger, the list is endless! They also have amazing salads and wraps! And you can not go wrong with bottomless French fries! The food is always fresh and tasty! I've never really had a complaint with the service either, but since they've revamped their restaurant, it seems the service has really gotten revamped too! The waiters/waitresses here really seem to enjoy their job and serving the customers! That is hard to find at restaurants these days!  Our waiter we had today,  Kelly, was amazing! Never an empty drink, always around to check on us to make sure we were doing good and enjoying the food! And they were super busy! Give that girl a raise!

I love Red Robin because they do such a great job at catering to food allergies. I have Celiac, so for me to be able to come in and have a burger with a bun and fries is just great.

10,Annamarie R.,"Roselle, IL",70,34,2.0,2.0,2017-06-29,"We love Red Robin. My family came in from out of state and they wanted some delicious burgers. The wait wasn't bad and we were seated almost immediately.  We haven't seen our family in quite some time so we enjoyed ourselves with conversation. I started to notice it had been quite some time that has passed and we were not yet asked for drink orders. Approx. 30 minutes after sitting. Our waitress came about 10 minutes later to get started with drinks. Thankfully those came pretty quickly. But we noticed it took another 15 minutes or so for her to return to take our order for food.  Now I understand they get busy. This is not so much why I gave them a 2 star. The reason I gave them a 2 star was because our waitress was awful. She was extremely rude. Dare to ask questions and you will feel the heat come from her eyes. I have never seen such a bad attitude on someone who works in a place with people. If you do not like your job then I suggest you should find one where you do not have to answer questions from customers.  Our food arrived about 30-40 minutes later. Mine was a bit cold at this point so I knew it was sitting around for some time. Our waitress disappeared for a good 30 minutes. I had to start flagging down other waitresses/waiters for Napkins and Ketchup.  The best part of a food place is the service you receive as well as excellent food. I'm sad to say that while my food was pretty good, the service was absolutely horrible. I hope the manager will see this and it gets fixed because I plan on returning but I will not be seated with her again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-mooresville,,,,,

They have awesome burgers and great onion rings for appetizers. The steak fries are endless so keep ordering until you get full. I like the whiskey river burger, mad love the best. They have some pretty pricey burgers but they definitely hit the spot. Get their rewards card, your 9th burger is free and they send you deals via email. Have had some issues with not getting the best service in the past, waiting and waiting trying to get a refill on my drink. But with that being said over the last year service has definitely improved. Almost every visit, a manager comes around to check on each table. All the servers and everyone we came into contact with have been super friendly. If you haven't been in a while give them another chance.
