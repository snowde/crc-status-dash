Yeah, it's Red Robin, they should have hostesses that can communicate to patrons that come in.

It's a large place and great for groups. It's very family friendly. We had a baby and two young boys in our group. Their noise level fit right in. Since I had burgers two meals in a row, I opted for the fish and chips. It was pretty good. I was very satisfied with it. Most people got burgers, my wife included. She got the Cry Baby which has ghost pepper chili on it. She said it had a kick, but wasn't too hot. This means the amount of ghost chili had to be super tiny. I had the bottomless strawberry lemonade. It was really good, and each glass was loaded with real pieces of strawberry. I went through like five of them.

Only had one bad experience here: they lost our order and our waiter didn't let us know it was being remade. Waiting over an hour is not cool when you have a small child. However, when I spoke to the manager, she was extremely apologetic, comped our meal, and gave us a GC for our next visit. I figure everyone can make a mistake, and the Red Robin's folks worked hard to rectify theirs, so kudos to them. Only reason not a 5 star is because they stopped giving free baskets of fries prior to your meal arriving.

121,Jesse S.,"Little Elm, TX",108,782,26.0,1.0,2012-10-27,"There was a long wait for a table, like 20 minutes. I asked the waitress if they had any non-alcoholic beer. The waitress laughed at me and said no. I don't know what's so funny about wanting a non-alcoholic beer. I asked if she's SURE you don't have any because most restaurants have it. She said she's sure they don't have it.  So I walked over to the bar and ordered a non-alcoholic beer and they did indeed have it. I went back to my table with it and when the waitress came around again, I showed it to her and said this is a non-alcoholic beer. The waitress said ""I don't know anything about beer."" I pointed out to the waitress that she said she was sure they didn't have it. The waitress responded ""I'm new here"" First off, I don't appreciate a waitress laughing at me because of my drink selection. Second, I expect a waitress at a restaurant to know the entire menu, including the drink menu. If a waitress isn't sure whether they have a certain drink or not, she should CHECK instead of telling me she's sure you don't have it, when she really has no idea what you have or don't have.  I find the service insulting. As for the food, I ordered the A.1. Peppercorn Burger which is $11. It took the food a long time to come out, and mine was served cold. The peppercorn sauce had no taste. I was expecting something spicy or tangy or something, but it was very bland. It tasted nothing like peppercorn.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-morgan-hill?start=120,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.308,3.2800000000000002
192,Taylor S.,"Little Elm, TX",98,203,,1.0,2012-10-28,"We went here last night for the first and last time. The food itself wasn't awful, but it wasn't anything worth coming back for. The service was even worse. My husband (who also reviewed) asked if they sell non-alcoholic beer and the waitress laughed at him and said no. When she returned later to take our food order, he asked her again if she was absolutely sure they don't have any non-alcoholic beer, and she said she was sure they didn't.  I don't get the attitude at all. First of all, it's really rude to laugh in the face of someone placing an order.  Second, isn't it in the waitstaff's best interest to get the customer's bill as  high as possible? How do you think tips are calculated? He ended up walking over to the bar and paying for the beer over there (because yes, they actually DO serve it). That's four dollars off our bill, so more money off her tip (well, in addition to the money he deducted for the terrible service. Seriously- don't laugh at your customers).  When she returned he showed her the beer and not only was she totally flippant about stating she was sure before, she didn't offer any apology for her attitude and said she was ""new here.""  I have waited tables before, and while I understand completely it takes a while to learn the menu, how hard is it to ask the bartender which beers are available if you're not sure?

I now have to make a 25 minute drive north to enjoy Red Robin in piece and quite!! I suggest a reform in management if this place wants to stay in business.

The hostess told me no because the server was overwhelmed, then took about five minutes to clean off a round table near the restrooms in the middle of traffic.

The servers and hostess were working hard. From all the dirty tables I have to assume they didn't have anyone to clean the tables. I would recommend that the manager who was walking around, half heartedly asking each table how their meal was, could have pitched in and cleared some tables.  We were really hungry so we ordered chips which didn't come until after we got our entrees. They were kind enough to take them back to the kitchen. We had burgers which were just ok. When our burgers arrived I realized we didn't have napkins or utensils so we waited, staring at our burgers for a bit. They did return with the silverware and napkins but unfortunately only forks. I needed a knife. More waiting. They brought our table of four 1 knife which we all shared to cut our food.

Not today and not in the past either. We were pleasantly greeted and seated right away. Server came out, sort of quiet but pleasant as well. We ordered our drinks, and she quickly came back with the kids but ours were still being filled at the bar. Fine. She came back, without the drinks and took our order. After 10+ minutes of taking our drink order, they finally arrive AFTER reminding her that we were still waiting. Beer was coldish, wine was warmish. Husband got a wedge salad which was not fresh. The lettuce appeared to have been cut since morning as the edges were dry. The outer leaves were limp, the other problem was that the dressing was on the outer leaf which was inedible. Husband asked for more dressing and we never got it. We told the server we would not be paying for the salad. She never apologized and just said okay,  We all got our food, the kids were happy with theirs, husband got fish and chips which were what he expected and I got a chicken sandwich and ordered the fruit for the side. All I got was a chicken sandwich in the basket, no fruit, wilted produce and an onion with the skin still on. Peel the onion. Simple. The server noticed that my basket looked missing so she brought me out some fries. 12 of them, they were warmish and I think she took them off of another table who already picked over the good ones. Terrible. None of our food was hot or fresh tasting, it was dying at the window and no one picked it up on time. It was basically one of those meals where you go home hoping that no one gets food poisoning. I will not be coming back. Even if I get a gift card. Blech!

Secondly I ordered the culls an shrimp; I've ordered this before at a red robin in Vacaville and it was really good there. Here- not so much. It comes to the table the shrimp looks Unappealing and you can tell by first glance it was cooked in extremely unclean oil. Plus there were only 5 small pieces and two chicken strips; if I remember correctly the one in Vacaville came with more- it was actually worth 12 dollars. This one was not. Not at all.  Now when the manager came over, he didn't  exactly help either. I said I didn't want it several times and yet he insisted to take it off the bill and get me more strips. That wasn't the point. I did not want it. And he did not listen because awhile later he comes back with more strips.  Thankfully though another, (what I believe to be) manager came over. He was much easier to work with and actually listened and got us everything the other manager & waitress did not. Sadly I don't know his name but he was probably the only reason I have two stars. Though! I found it awfully rude that when the second manager was speaking to is for the first time the second manager came over and told him not to bug us even though he was doing a lot more good than the first one ever did.

Packed waiting area and no host to be seen. 2. When host did arrive she turned her back to everyone and started looking at her iPad. People had to say something to her to get her to put their name on the list. We put in our names and we were told 20 min wait. It was 1:00 on a Sunday so I figured not to bad.  3. Looking around the restaurant and counting the number of empty/dirty tables and I was shocked. There were 14 dirty tables and with a full waiting area you think they would put some hustle in their step. NOPE they are moving like snails. The servers walk by dirty tables over and over again. I get it, it's not your job but I think you would want more tips and the longer we wait the smaller the tips get....... 4. 35 minutes later with 3 clean tables in the place (yes still 14 dirty ones) we get seated. I am not over stating anything when I say 14 dirty tables, the table right next to the waiting area was dirty from the moment we walked in to the moment we left. 5. We are seated, starving, and with a hungry 6 year old so we want to order now. Takes the server almost 10 minutes to come to our table. There is a table to our right complaining that it has taken 30 minutes to get their check and a table to our left that keeps asking for the manager. We order everything the moment he arrives. 6. Order is:  Soda, Tea (extra lemon), kids lemonade, and chocolate shake. Kids spaghetti, Blue Burger, and a red robin burger.  When we got the drinks there was 1 lemon wedge and the shake had no whip cream & no tin with extra. When my Blue Burger arrived it had burnt onion strings. The server did get me new onion strings but that is a big fail at quality control. He never asked if we wanted refills on our drinks.  7. Check please! We asked for boxes and the check as soon as we could. Another 10 minutes to get the check.  8. And last but no least, the bathrooms. I'm lucky that there was a roll sitting on the handicap bar. There were empty rolls on the floor. Garbage can overflowing. You can ell no one had been in there in HOURS. As I'm washing my hands the hostess walks out washes her hands and leaves.

286,Ken J.,"Morgan Hill, CA",0,10,3.0,1.0,2015-01-31,"Update: 5/2016 Despite previous experiences, my family has eaten at the MH location and others a few times since my last comments. Our recent experiences at the MH location up to last week have been mixed. On two early lunch time visits the service was extremely slow despite the relatively small lunchtime crowd. The food was fine and the service though slow was attentive to the needs of the table. Another dinner visit started out fine. The place wasn't busy (~50% capacity) and service was slow but good enough. The order was messed up or the food was prepared incorrectly (missing items). Asking the server for clarification didn't help. We were told that the food item was prepared correctly and that we were probably mistaken... That's possible.  Jump to last week.  For a treat we decided to eat out and my kids voted for RR. We went early to avoid past problems. We were seated right away and had a great waiter that got us started immediately with drinks. The table and seats were quite dirty and littered with crumbs and smudges from the previous diners. My daughter took her first sip from her water and the straw blocked... thinking it was ice tried again and got what looked like a piece of pickle (we hope) in her mouth. The food came and again one of the items was prepared incorrectly or was completely misrepresented in the menu. Asking for clarification on this occasion was answered almost exactly the same way. The Ketchup at the table was empty and the one we got from a neighboring empty table was so greasy it had to be wiped down with a napkin to be held. My fingers looked wet. The well-done burger patties on two of the sandwiches were burned on one side (truly burned). An attempt was made to hide it under the cheese and abnormally large amounts of sauce. I couldn't eat mine.  In short, the server was attentive but unaffected by questions about the quality of the food preparation. The table was dirty the dishes were dirty and the food burned. I left a full tip, at least two half-full plates and probably left for the last time. 1/31/2015 I love Red Robin's burgers and fish 'n chips.  I try to keep an open mind  when it comes to reviews because we are more likely to be motivated to voice a complaint than praise. However, last night was beyond belief.  I've taken my family to the MH location for a couple of years  and eaten at the restaurant at locations all over the US. The menu and service is generally good or on par with other restaurants of this type. But in this case with the MH location  I've been steadily and increasingly disappointed with the service.  Last night was a busy  Friday night.  We were prepared for a long wait.  We weren't well enough prepared.  We ordered after a long wait.  We asked for utensils  which we didn't have.  An hour later we had had our drinks refilled  once but my son had to leave to go to work without eating. The food came about 20 min later.  It was cold.  We still didn't have eating utensils or drink refills. After asking our waiter twice and another waitress for utensils, my wife got up and walked back to the prep station to find him. He said he'd get them  but continued for some minutes with whatever else he was doing. I found a waitress who finally got us something to eat with.  Our waiter came along 15 minutes later with drinks and a Sheepish grin. We began our cold  meal 30 minutes after the food came.  The food was ok but would have been good or great if warm.  The sad thing is we were not alone. Some tables got up and left in frustration.  Needless to say that was our last visit to the MH location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-morgan-hill?start=260,1.4,2.46,2.46,1.5080000000000002,2.036

The waitress greeted us pretty quickly. She even got our drinks fairly quick as well. It was amazing! Then it went downhill in the typical Morgan Hill Red Robin fashion. I asked the waitress if we could get a basket of fries since right away I had a little one who was hungry. The answer was yes. Of course I knew I wouldn't be getting those fries. I've asked the same question 3 times during my last 3 visits and told yes each time. And all 3 times my request was ignored. Try it if you're reading this. See what happens.  Anyway, the food comes out 25 minutes later. I have a bacon cheeseburger. It's nice and cold. Fries too. We ordered fruit for my son's meal and got fries instead. Happens all the time there though.  Glasses never got re-filled. Waitress hardly checked on us. Had to ask for utensils and napkins. Ketchup bottle was empty.  It just seems this place is massively understaffed.

136,Jeff R.,"Watsonville, CA",52,111,3.0,1.0,2015-04-01,"After posting a lengthily review of my experience on Yelp, I was contacted by (what I assume was a manager) via the yelp review asking me for my contact information.  I forwarded this to them and never heard back from anybody. Oh well........ Just to make sure others can see my original reply that was minimized by this current update, I've cut and pasted the review here: Decided to eat at Chili's off Cochran in Morgan Hill.  As we drove up we saw a large group of people in the foyer.  Didn't know if they were waiting or leaving, so we decided to drive next door to Red Robin instead. It was Sunday night at 8:00 PM.  Walked in and there was no hostess for over a minute.  We were the only ones in the Foyer.   As we were standing there, other employees passed us without any acknowledgment.  The place was kind-a of busy but the first thing that we noticed was so many tables were empty but need to be bused from the past guests on both side of the premises, bar and main dinging room.  Finally young women (Hostess) walked up with wind-blown hair and greeted us.  Her hair was so frazzled it was like she just flew in from a hang glider......Not very professional nor kept! We were seated and five minutes later our waitress came over and said she'd be right back. Ten minutes later she came to take our drink order.  She must have been pretty new as she didn't know the prices of the import draft beers nor the condiments on the burgers listed in the menu.  We placed our order and waited another ten minutes for our drinks to arrive.  Side note; all the tables that need to be bused still remained.  See pictures.  Another twenty minutes went by and our waitress came over and surprisingly dropped off a basket of fries and apologized for the wait.  She scurried off.  We grabbed the ketchup from our table and it was empty.  I went over to another table a retrieved another from a vacant (un-bussed table) but it was empty too.  I finally found a half way full bottle and duped our fries.  The fries were absolutely room temp cold.  Needless to say we didn't eat them.  Also to be mentioned as we were waiting, I noticed that one of the cooks (in the kitchen) with long dark hair did not have a hat of cap on. I think this might be a requirement of food staff........ More time passed and our waitress never came back.  The wind- swept hostess was busy making red balloons and remained much focused on her little task.  As other people entered the restaurant they too had to wait in the foyer.  It was now 45 minutes since we'd been seated, the tables around us still remained to be bused and oh yeah, never a manager around. At our fifty minute mark without any food and cold fries, I decided to leave.  I left money with the hostess for our drinks and we left. Drove across the freeway and ate drive through at In-N-Out Burger.  Way better and no drama nor wait! I haven't worked in the food service industry for quite some time, but if this was my establishment heads would be rolling.  I would hate to have a review like this one on my property.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-morgan-hill?start=120,1.68,2.3,2.3,1.6360000000000001,2.052

175,Sam W.,"San Jose, CA",7,20,,1.0,2015-04-13,"Made the mistake of taking my family in here Sunday evening for the following reasons: 1. Understaffed - which led to empty tables with a long wait plus un-bussed tables for us to look at for long periods of time while we were eating. 2. No one greeted us at our table for well over 5 minutes. Maybe 10 minutes. A waiter was walking by and saw that we hadn't been greeted yet, so he would ""help us out"" and take the table. Sorry, but I don't come to a restaurant and drop almost $50 to be a charity case. 3. During the meal, I asked our server for a refill on my soda. He took my half full cup and placed it on the nearby shelf. I had to wait well over 10 minutes to get another drink. Train your staff to NOT take guests' drinks and to simply bring them a new one when the ask for refills. In the server's defense, I think he was frazzled due to having too many tables which leads us back to short staffing.  * The food was excellent as always though.

I ordered more sauce, that I was ""charged"" since it appears on the little game console and then it was forgotten.  Took many attempts to get drink refills.  After much grief I approached the hostess who sent over the manager. The manager served the rest of our food, got us more fries and drink refills and ultimately took care of our entire meal.  This manager said that she coached this server and that she is fairly new, and my family thinks that this server should let customers know she's new to the restaurant. It would inspire more sympathy. The manager was very nice, she didn't have to cover our meal.  Oh and she never told us her name, otherwise I would name drop.  These possible meth problems were pretty bad.

145,Rochelle C.,"San Jose, CA",2,26,3.0,2.0,2015-09-08,"Every time I come into this restaurant I hope the experience is better. It just isn't. I order the same item every time I eat at Red Robin, the Whiskey River BBQ Wrap, and each time it's placed in front of me the preparation is different. Is the chicken supposed to be hot or cold? Is the lettuce supposed to be hot or cold? Should the cheese be melted? Is there supposed to be ranch or BBQ on it? This place is so inconsistent that I don't know how my entree is intended to be prepared.  The servers are nice, but the service is bad. There just isn't good communication between the servers and their guests. It takes WAY too long to get your food at this location and when you do it's sub-par at best. I often find myself twisting around in my seat to find someone, ANYONE, who can give me the status of my order/refill a drink/drop off some fries because my food is taking faaaar too long to get to my table. This could be mostly alleviated if the servers were better at stopping off at their tables and communicating with their guests. It's also frustrating that after a bad experience the server will drop off the bill without apology or attempting to make the customer happy. A free round of drinks, dessert, entree really goes a long way after a poor dining experience.  Management needs to step it up at this location.

254,Em O.,"Gilroy, CA",0,82,3.0,1.0,2015-11-18,"Every single time we resort to coming here it is the same: Servers are very sweet, but the actual service is inconsistent.  We were both servers, in fact I was a server for over a decade and I am absolutely shocked to see the amount of servers going to the back without full hands (meaning they have pre-bussed a table) and coming out of the kitchen without full hands, meaning they are not bringing food out. The result for the customer is a table full of empty glasses and dirty dishes, and that your food has been waiting so long to be delivered after cooking that it is just warm at best when it comes to the table.  My former managers at the various restaurants I have worked at would never have allowed this. Getting the food out hot was one of the top priorities even if the food you were delivering was to a table that was not yours. The server should be in tuned to the guests' needs even if the those needs are not outwardly expressed.That means if someone has a kid, get them in and out as quickly as possible or ask if they can fire up a kids meal asap. This means bringing refills out even if a guest doesn't ask for them.  we asked for refills, and they were never brought. It seems to me that the management could help guide the servers as to how to manage their sections more like one big table rather than individual tables. For instance get all the drinks at once, get refills at once, refill waters all at once and even refill waters in a station next to yours for another server, clear dishes all at once etc... Management could teach servers how to multi task when they are going in an out of the kitchen by making sure that everyone has full hands in and full hands out. I worked at a restaurant where we were not even allowed to go into the kitchen without bringing something back from the tables and not allowed to come out of the kitchen without something to deliver out to a table. Bottom line is they have a staff that is friendly and wants to please people but just need the tools and guidance on how to do this better. These are easy simple fixes that don't take a lot of time, but vastly improve the quality of the food and service.   Needless to say we won't be back after so many not so great experiences.

So by the time our food gets here, one of my friends food didn't taste like a single thing. He put salt and pepper. Even the fries seasoning. Nothing. We had to flag down the waitress to get her attention. Told her it was terrible. She took his burger and didn't charge him. Btw the person who drove in from Hollister and got there late, she forgot his drink order! He was 1/2 way through his meal before he got his drink. Plus, the drink that was sent over from another table, we also got their food order. She mixed us up with another table. So, this is the part where it really gets bad. We are sitting and sitting and sitting and sitting. Waiting for our check. Btw, we told her it was all separates tabs when we sat down. Now, red robin has tablets at every table where you can split the tab and pay.  As we tried to do this. She messed up everything single tab. She only charged two people of our party for drinks. Others, she added extra appetizers that another person ordered. She even added extra drinks. Once again, we flag her down. Told her we'd like the check. She tells us to use the tablet. We tell her they are messed up. She leaves to fix it. And we wait. And we wait and we wait. And we wait. All of us feeling held hostage cause ALL WE WANT TO DO IS PAY AND LEAVE!!! So I go and find another waitress ask for the manager. She disappears. And we wait and we wait and we wait and we wait. So, finally I find the hostess. Ask her for the manager. She disappears. We wait and wait and we wait. Finally I get up and look for him myself. Found him, sorting through all our checks. Finally I was able to complain and get things straighten out. Plus, all our appetizers were taken off for the wait. Which was nice but the waitress had the nerve to ask us what she did wrong!? She didn't do anything right! I watched other people be seated, get there food, and leave. THEY ARRIVED AFTER US! She waited on them! She did not wait on us at all! Sad thing the bill was about $120 dollars between the 5 of us. We ended up only paying $40! She lost them so much money! We were even planning on buy more alcoholic beverages and desert. Nope!

We were unable to order ourselves as the device was broken she came back after 10 minutes and took our drink order. The boys of course wanted the all you can drink root beer floats. When she dropped off the drinks she took our order and we did not see her for a while everyone needed refills by this time. Someone else dropped off out food. We had no silverware and my husbands order was wrong. It took a while to get someone to acknowledge us as they were all back there chit chatting We had someone else bring us silverware then our waitress came and asked if we wanted refills. I told her my husband did not order sweet potatoes fries and would like regular fries. He did not get the fries until long after he was done with his meal. I pointed out that we were charged for the sweet potatoes fries she said she would take care of it took the bill. When she returned it was still wrong. I just paid for it.

She told us she needed to ask her manager & we were okay with that. When she came back she not only was giving us attitude but started arguing with us. She then told us the manager approved the passport and my friend could order a drink, but she told us she wasn't going to allow it. It was an experience that definitely left a bitter taste in my mouth & it wasn't something we expected at all.

58,Jonathan G.,"Newman, CA",18,15,14.0,1.0,2016-10-30,"I would like to tell my story about this particular Red Robin. I have always been a huge fan of Red Robin. I love their food and mostly their friendly staff. We were visiting some family in Morgan Hill and we decided to grab a late lunch/early dinner. We arrived at Red Robin and greeted by the host immediately. We were seated in less than 5 minutes. Shortly after being seated our original waitress addressed us stating that she was told to go home because she was on overtime. Meanwhile, we still weren't asked what we wanted to drink. Our new server was introduced and again failed to take our drink order until we asked her. She ended up taking our kids order so they didn't get impatient . However, the service went to crap from there. We were sitting for another 10 minutes or so before we finally told her we are ready to order and she rolled our eyes. At this point our order was placed and we were patiently waiting for our food. While waiting for our food another waitress was sticking her hand down her pants scratching her bum. We were all disgusted with this behavior. Thankfully, she was not our waitress. Our waitress arrived with our food shortly after the previous incident. While 3/4 of our party received their food the other 2 did not and she apologized and had the kitchen get the orders out asap. This is were it got interesting. My sibling and his wife received cold chicken sandwiches as well as mayonnaise which they didn't ask for (not a big deal). Well, I bit into my sandwich and I bit into a big long blond hair. I literally almost threw up on the table. We immediately asked for the manager and we had to ask 4 different waiters before she came over. She asked what the problem was and I aggressively told her that I had a hair in my food. She told me to calm down and not be aggressive. I asked her what she would do if she bit into a piece of hair? Guess what? Crickets!!!! We told her that we just wanted to leave and she became irritated and started rolling her eyes telling us just to leave. This behavior is not tolerable at all and she didn't try to rectify the issue at hand. I believe the way she managed the situation was her poor and she should not be working with the public. I have to say, I am not the one to complain; however, this was not acceptable nor will I ever be back to a Red Robin again. I will spend my money elsewhere. I will be writing a letter to the corporate office to tell my story. Thank you for reading my review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-morgan-hill?start=60,2.52,2.01,2.34,1.8280000000000003,2.214

Finish our o-rings, and our burgers arrive about 10 minutes later. Burger is cooked all the way through, yet the cheese hasn't melted onto the meat. As if they cooked off 100 patties earlier, and just nuked them later. Burger is cold, cheese is goeey, and the fries are cold and almost soggy.  Server was nowhere to be seen for about 15 minutes...so I didn't have a chance to bring it to her attention. Halfway into our burgers, Anthony comes over with the remote, and changes the channel. With 3 other TV's, I asked him why he changed the channel. His response was ""my manager told me it's a corporate policy, not to broadcast it"" Being a bit annoyed, and dissatisfied, we left in a hurry. I forgot my Oakley sunglasses, and my Patriots hat I wore. So the following morning, we stopped by on our way out of town to collect those items. Girl at the hostess stand, tells us that the items are nowhere to be found. My guess is, the busser grabbed the Oakleys, and tossed the hat. A few days later, I reached out to Red Robin Corp, and asked if there was a policy against showing boxing, or MMA - apparently there isn't one. The manager just had her panties in a bunch, and deemed it inappropriate for adults of age to watch. I've been to at least a dozen different RR's, and luckily I live FAR away from Morgan Hill. So chances are slim, that I'll ever visit again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-morgan-hill,2.4,2.1,2.244,1.7960000000000003,2.22

6,Tiffany B.,"Oakland, CA",110,158,287.0,4.0,2017-09-17,I decided to come here bc I was too lazy to cook and I had a 21% off to go orders coupon. I arrived a few minutes early so I went inside to wait. The eye candy bartender was a major treat. I think I would come in just to watch him like one would repeatedly return to a store to stare longingly at a Hermès bag that they want but can't have. The food was nicely packaged and ready even before the estimated time.  I ordered the smoky tavern burger and upgraded to poutine fries. I went home and started with the fries. I enjoyed the saltiness of the cheese curds with the garlic aioli and gravy. The flavors blended so well together. I don't think I can eat their fries any other way now. I'm not sure I'd order the cheese curds alone because smaller pieces were more breading that cheese. They were very filling. 5 stars The burger just didn't deliver like the sriacha double tavern I had a couple weeks ago. The BBQ sauce was delicious but needed more. The pepper jack cheese though I love didn't really do it for me. There was no heat. No savory taste. I think corporate needs to go back to the drawing board with this one. At least there was ranch in the bag that I could dip the burger in to enhance the taste. 3 stars,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-morgan-hill,2.64,2.1,2.228,,2.3160000000000003

12,America Y.,"Redwood City, CA",5,5,,1.0,2017-09-27,"DO NOT EAT HERE IF YOU HAVE FOOD ALLERGIES. Went to a Red Robin in another town after finding it on the Find Me Gluten Free app. Celiacs runs in my family, and I get extremely ill when exposed to gluten. After going to the one in San Bruno, I knew the deal and knew what to do... I thought.   As a chain, I had increased trust becaude they have a higher legal stake from being largescale. I have been to Red Robin before in another city very recently so I knew how the process this time. First I asked the hostess for the gluten free menu. The hostess instead argued with me that they don't have one. When I mentioned the previous Red Robin, she argued more and tried handing me the nutritional menu (which only shows calories). I told her to ask her manager about the gluten free menu, and she STILL argued about it until I demanded that she ask for it. Lo and behold, the gluten free menu does exist. Anyways, the waitress was very outgoing but wouldn't stop talking about my gluten problem. She kept mentioning not ever hearing about it until the last few years (my aunt was diagnosed over 30 years ago, but okay, sure. It's brand new). She basically made me her teacher, and while I was willing to explain, it was altogether uncomfortable. Anyways, she wrote Celiac on the ticket and took my order. The food took a while to come out and when it did I started eating it. About half way through something seemed off. I opened it up, and sure enough there were breaded fried jalapenos in there. I'm not the kind of person to demand a manager or demand a refund, but I expect the waitress to take it seriously after the restaurant POISONS a customer with an allergen. This is a legal issue. No manager came by, and no discount was given for the meal. The waitress LITERALLY said ""Just BELIEVE that you won't get sick!"" As I write this, the migraine and stomach problems are already creeping in. I feel awful and I will be feeling awful for at least a couple days. I don't get to BELIEVE I won't get sick. It is my biology. I'm lucky to only have a gluten problem. If I had an anaphylaxis inducing allergy to something I would be in the hospital tonight instead of just having to call in to work and school.

106,Luisa L.,"Gilroy, CA",0,9,5.0,1.0,2017-11-26,"My boyfriend and I came here for a burger a few weeks back and had the worst experience. The hostess told us the bar area was open seating if seating was available in there. We looked for a table which there were 6 but ALL of them were dirty. We asked if one could be clean and she said the busser was busy and continued on her phone. We walked around the bar area to see if one had gotten cleaned but no. During this time staff is just passing us by and passing all these dirty tables by, while other guest are waiting to sit in the bar as well. Finally the busser gets to them, he was probably the only one in there working hard that night. I ordered a root beer and decided I wanted a root beer float instead so the waitress who is also the bartender brought me a cup of ice cream to pour my root been into, other waiters see it spilling all over as I'm trying to pour it and don't even offer napkins as I'm trying to clean it with only one. It took forever to get our order taken, food to come out, and to get any assistance from our waitress since she was also busy at the bar. The waiters who were in the bar area saw out red light on and just walked past our table with the ""that's not my table"" attitude. The food came out and was cold and just thrown together. Our waitress never came around to ask for refills or more fries on the so called bottomless. I can continue to complain about staff but at the end of the day this review falls on the management. If there is a need they should be there to make sure it is met. No manager was anywhere to be found to make sure the restaurant was running smoothly and the guest were happy. Under staffed and the staff that was there were not motivated to do there job except for the busser who was trying his hardest to get the job done.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-morgan-hill?start=40,2.04,2.12,2.18,,2.088
