We first sat down and we're 2 of 6 people in the entire restaurant and took about 15 minutes for anyone to talk to us.  We inquired about the beer prices in which our server had no idea what they were.  We eventually made a decision on what beer (even though it was overpriced) and they had their manager come double check our ID's.  She was straight up rude and thought that we were using fake ID's.   We requested to have a basket of fries brought out prior to having our burgers for the wait.  This has never been a problem in the past but we were told they weren't able to do this.   Finally we received our burgers and those were fine.  The server asked if we wanted fry sauce and we did.  Took him another 15 minutes to bring the fry sauce out.    I've never felt the need to write a bad review about a restaurant until now.  We were totally uncomfortable the entire time we were there and if it weren't for the food I would have given this place 1 star.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-murray?start=80,2.408,2.408,2.408,2.408,2.4080000000000004

No answer.  At 15 minutes the phone call hung up.  I was half way there, and had not even got my order in.  I called back, told them what was going on, and then was put on hold for 2 more minutes while they got someone that could take my order.   I finally got someone on the phone, put in my order, and asked what the breakdown was. Of course there was no real answer, but they would ""see about getting (me) a discount"", and that my salad would be ready in 15 minutes.

I must admit that even though I love the burger I just mentioned I did get a salad as I have seen the calorie content of aforementioned favorite meal.

The entree took quite awhile to get, the appetizer, even longer and with that they sat with empty water and lemonade glasses for half the meal. No refill was ever offered. The food was fine.

73,Vanessa R.,"Salt Lake City, UT",0,10,,1.0,2016-05-22,I just went here Friday night for my birthday it was a very horrible experience. We waited for over an hour to be seated since we had a large party we were put in a room off to the side I quickly noticed it would not just be us as there were several other tables with people. No one took our order till being there 2 hours they brought us our drinks and finally brought fries to tide us over 20 minutes before receiving our food we did not get our food till after 2 1/2 hours. Our waitress was a complete idiot when people use the term blonde well let's just say it suited her well. She did not even ask my Mother what she wanted to order my friend had to tell her she still needed to order. I had ordered a raspberry Margherita and she brought out a plain one so she had to switch that. My mother said her food was so bad she took it home and gave the meat to her dogs my mother is too nice to say when she doesnt like something she also asked to sub fries for something and had to pay 2 extra dollars. My friend that was sitting next to her got chili with her order and told the waitress she did not like it instead of asking what else she would like she brought her a bigger bowl of the same chili. When my fiance received his burger it had lettuce on it so she offered to make him a new one even after we already waited over 2 hours for our original dishes. When I received my food it was not even warm and the lettuce tasted slimy. My other friend had an order of fries and she sat them down in front of my mother who told her earlier she could not eat fries. When my fiance and I received our bill she charged us for 3 Margheritas not one so then she had to fix our bill as well. This girl needs to find a new job although I'm sure she's too dumb to find one. I will never go here again.... my fiance and I had gone there last year and had an awful experience again we had a male waiter this time and when he approached our table to ask for my order he was clearly very hungover I asked him what kind of sauces they had for my burger and he told me over a million and if he was to tell me them he'd be there all day... I asked him to tell me atleast 5 and he came up with two. I was pregnant at the time and asked when he came back to get extra sauce for my fiance and he reeked so badly of alcohol I threw up I requested to speak to his manager and he took over ftom there.

I got the Red Ramen Burger ( pic & description from their website included ), which was weird but overall not bad. The ""bun"" consisted of ramen noodles & gave the burger a nice crunchy bite to it. I am glad that I tried it, but it will probably be the only time. They have plenty of delicious burgers ,with a plethora of toppings, to satisfy any taste. The endless fries are a hit & yummy as always. I like the choices of gourmet dipping sauces you can get for your fries.

This location smells bad, really bad, like dirty wet carpet. It reminds me of the smell of an old elementary  school cafeteria, or the liquid you pour out of a used carpet cleaning machine. This is the main reason I have given two stars to this red Robin.   The smell is so unappetizing. Our server jodi did an ok job today. But in past visits we had the unfortunate experience of having a girl named Megan be our server. Megan had friends of hers seated in her section and that's what she was concerned about the whole time. We could barely get her attention for refills all the while she was talking and bringing free food and drinks to her obnoxious friends. That was last year and I still remember what a terrible experience we had and how the place stunk back then as well. As far as the food today, the burger buns were soggy, like wet and falling apart from water and the burgers were cooked to varying temps.  My boyfriends was too rare, barely medium. While his mom's was overcooked and gray. I get the boca burger, which is hard to mess up. But we peeled off the nasty wet buns.

We were created by very friendly staff at the door, but our waiter was an emotionless, inattentive and unfriendly.  My girlfriend's clam chowder was ice cold and her grilled cheese was burnt. She only ate a couple spoons of soup and 3 bites of her sandwich.  My mushroom burger was nearly inedible. The top bun was dry and crumbly, bottom bun was wet and mushy, sautéed mushrooms were cold and unseasoned. I only ate about half of it.  My mom and sister had a rather difficult time eating their burgers as well - they kept falling apart and crumbling. Each only ate a few bites of their burgers.

They do take military and student discounts if that applies.  I would recommend any of their burgers, and specially whiskey river. You have to a BBQ and onion ring kind of dude or dudette. Normally if you don't get an appetizer, your server will bring out fries for you to munch on while you wait.  I wasn't too thrilled with my service today, which knocked it down to a two star.

The floors were filthy, the high chair looked filthy (later saw why. They don't wipe down high chairs after use). Burger were ok, fries were over cooked. One of the bussers smelled like he hadnt showered in weeks and kept cleaning with a musty smelling rag near us. Was hard to eat. Then he sat down at a table with friends and was walking around eating fries while cleaning. The staff just seemed sad just like this location.

35,Rena A.,"Sandy, UT",79,162,96.0,1.0,2017-04-16,"Our Server was named Jesse and if he's curious why he got a crappy tip and a note on the bill this is where he will find that info. First let's start with the fact that I asked what types of drinks they had and his response ""coke products"", I hadn't even picked up my menu yet and didn't want to be rude by making him wait. Turns out they have all kinds of lemonades and milkshakes etc. Husband and I ordered 2 cokes and when he came back he asked if we were ready. I ordered the bleu Ribbon burger as my husband got the tavern double although it didn't seem like a double anything. Jesse then asked for our menus back,  like we were planning on keeping them. The food came quickly which was nice but when Jesse walked away my husband realized he wanted campfire sauce for his fries and opted to wait until our waiter came back. I told him that wasn't happening. Anyone who's gone into a restaurant with kids should know the feel when the waiter wants nothing more than for you to take your kids and leave,  well the whole experience had that feel. Maybe because I had on a halter top and my husband was in his work uniform? Dunno but I know the look a waiter gives you when they don't think you're going to tip them well. And this time Jesse, you were right.  Didn't come back to the table until we were completely done,  though you did walk by our table 5 times to check on the older couple behind us. Don't worry though Jesse,  you won't be seeing us again. I do not give my business to a company who's employees think they can treat people poorly based on what they look like. Food was ok,  an offer for more fries would have been awesome but oh well,  we curbed our appetite with a restaurant down the street.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-murray?start=20,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4

(We've ordered this item multiple times) They even tried remaking it 3 times! Finally we just said, forget it.  The mushroom burger was the worst!  They should've just brought me a dish of salt to eat!  You would think that Jenny, the ""lead manager"", would know how their menu items are supposed to be cooked!  She had NO idea!

Last night, our server took forever to get to us, brought appetizers with no napkins (my father in law brought us paper towels from the bathroom so we could wipe our hands because our table was not revisited), our food took forever, which he told us was because the kitchen dropped our ticket and forgot to make it, however when it came out, the burgers were overcooked and dried out (probably sat under a heat lamp), we had to get the server to take our check back because he dropped it and we actually wanted dessert. Just pretty poor service all around. Shout out to Orlando the food runner though, literally the hardest working person in this restaurant last night. He was on top of it.

2,Tyler P.,"Magna, UT",2,18,13.0,2.0,2017-09-19,"Gourmet is far from how i would describe this experience. Second bad experience in a small time period. Red Robin has lots of decor to keep the appeal of a ""fun filled"" place to eat. However, the last few times i have been there, this is about the highlight.  We ordered fried zucchini to start off, as they bring bottomless fries to the table, but the seasoning is a bit overkill. The zucchini was decent and probably the best thing we ate there. I ordered a caprese chicken sandwich and was sadly disappointed. The sauce was bland and the chicken was rubbery like that out of a high school boiling pot.  We had a coupon we tried to use for a ""free burger with the purchase of another burger"", to which was denied. They couldn't call the burger my friend ordered under that coupon because he got lettuce instead of a bun...weird. Also, you have to purchase 2 drinks in addition to get the $5 burger for free.  The service was mediocre but i had to do a lot of things on my own: Get more napkins, clear the table and stack the dishes in his hands for him, ask multiple servers for a refill on water, etc. I walked out of there $20 meal, that i felt like i could have gourmet myself at home for half the price.
