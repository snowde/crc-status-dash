44,Jennifer H.,"Caldwell, ID",218,65,5.0,4.0,2012-04-27,"I've been to this Red Robin a few times since I've moved here, food is always good and the service is always decent. A few weeks back, I went with my family (my mother, father, 3 yr old daughter and myself). My mom and I got there before my dad and daughter. I asked the host for a booth and a high chair, she quickly told me she couldn't put me at one because they have a step up and they can't put high chairs there. I wanted to be sat because they were filling up quickly so I said yeah ok fine and was sat with a boster seat. We ordered. Our waiter was amazing. He was attentive and nice. Anyways, my daughter started to hit the want to get up stage right as our food got to our table and my dad had already gone out to the car when I noticed another family at a booth with a high chair. So I asked for a togo box for my dads food and to speak to the manager. The manager Kevin was friendly and nice. He apologized for the hosts not telling us we could have waited for another booth so we could have had the high chair for my daughter. He also comped my dads meal. That's an amazing manager.  I will keep coming back for the service and management alone. Their host can step their game up though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nampa?start=40,2.512,2.512,2.512,2.512,2.5120000000000005

It's a lively, loud, kid-friendly place with great burgers, adequate salads, and refillable beverages. I usually order a burger as they are pretty much the best burgers around. If you're concerned about carb intake, go bunless.

The food is good, the service is decent, I have to say, however, my waitress left me wondering if I was going to get my drink as ordered. When you call ingredients for your bar drink instead of ordering off the ""happy fun booze menu,"" and your waitress immediately wanders to the POS system and exclaims ""what's a gin and tonic? How do I do that?"" it makes you wonder. I took a visit to the bar, just to be sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nampa?start=20,2.252,2.252,2.252,2.252,2.252

But the waitress was absolutely inattentive apparently expecting the cooks to bring our food out exclaiming, ""Oh he was suppose to bring that out...."" before waddling off to go banter (within eye-shot of all tables) with other staff. It was kind of funny to watch table after table get seated yet see no one take orders, bring drinks. I think it took us 20 minutes to get an extra ""cup"" of their ""bottomless fries"". Which is another thing, put the fries on the plate next to the burger. Don't get fancy with your mediocre handful of fries. The burgers were already smaller and 2 bucks more than nearly any other place in town that serves a decent burger. Really dissapointing place.

Not only was my usual swiss mushroom burger NOTHING like a red robin mushroom burger it was like eating charbroiled cardboard with canned mushrooms. Nothing like red Robin Boise at all. My granddaughter had one bite of her 5.00 kids burger spit it out and said eeeeeewwwww! Couldn't agree more. When I asked waitress what the deal was she proceeded to ignore us to the point I had to find someone else to pay. I gave him my ticket and a hundred dollar bill and 15 minutes later he brings me a five and ten ones. My bill was  $18.62! No way was I leaving them a 65.00 tip! Unimpressed in the extreme!

The food is generally pretty good and filling, the endless fries helps with that. I usually eat the buffalo clucks, which are generally pretty good if you like breaded chicken strips. I've had several of their various burgers, all of which seem ok and pretty standard. I've also had their whiskey river chicken wrap as well, which seems to be much less tasty here lately for some reason I cannot explain. It almost tastes like they've started making it differently. My mother in law also thinks so, as this is her ""go to"" red robin dish. They have some new burgers on the menu that appear to be more gourmet and have better beef than their regular burger counterparts, but I can't figure out how they are really all that much better. Frankly they must be pretty proud of these gourmet burgers, because some of them are almost 15 bucks a pop. They must be made from dragon meat and seasoned with orphan tears or something, I don't know. I just know I have a hard time paying that much for a hamburger. Bottom line is it isn't a bad place to eat, but not a fantastically wonderful place either. Pretty middle of the road.

Maybe it's their way  to get you out the door quickly.  I order the BLTA Croissant with fruit as a side instead of the standard fries.  I was very happy with my choice as the sandwich was very tasty and the fruit was great complement.

Shortly after that we got our burgers, not the pink we ordered, well done. Flavor almost made up for fact burgers were overcooked, almost. I noticed wife didn't get the sweet potatoes as ordered, they came much later, glad we didn't get charged for them.

She came back with our cokes and took our order.

We both finished our burgers and our first round of fries still no waitress. I don't enjoy eating burgers and fries without something to drink. She came back over with our drinks and no more fries, she then asked us if we would like more fries so we said yes. She brought the fries out by that time we were paying our bill on the machine, she then asked us if we would like a few drinks to go, we said yes. We waited 10 minutes never saw her again.

It's always packed so I figured I was missing something. Nope, they're just not that great. Today the kid's meal was ridiculously skimpy... the 6 tiny meatballs... the fruit cup served in one of those black ketchup cups. I got the Whiskey Burger. I swear I could SEE the BBQ sauce on there, but couldn't taste it. And burger patty is also suspicious. I think it's frozen into perfect circles with a TON of fillers.. and then slapped on the grill frozen. So little taste. Gross, even. Why am I giving them 2 stars and not 1?

5,John H.,"Caldwell, ID",14,120,2.0,1.0,2016-12-21,"In the final analysis, I think the ""answer"" here is never, ever eat at a restaurant where the menu is dominated by pages and pages of photographs, depicting the food items. What, they can't simply describe the items, without a photo? Maybe the menu is designed for folks who can't read, I don't know; those customers can, then, just point to a photo and say, ""Me wants dat."" I ordered the ""Prime Chophouse Burger"" ($9.69), which is described as: "" ... distinguished and delicious, this juicy burger is layered with horseradish-sauteed mushrooms, gourmet steak sauce, provolone cheese and piled high with crispy onion straws. served on an onion bun with creamy country dijon sauce."" The burger was okay, but barely. The bun was soft, soggy, and tasteless.  The thing was served with french fries, which had the consistency of balsa wood, dry, tasteless, and not cooked well enough. The only thing that made the fries go down, was a copious amount of ketchup and, thank gawd for small favors, there was lots of that. On one level, I could argue that I got my money's worth, because the burger was repeating on me for hours after that, burp! They should serve complimentary Alka Seltzer as an after-meal drink. The waitress was so obsequious, she was driving me nuts. She must have stopped by my booth ten times, while I was trying to eat this thing. Yes, it is good if a waitperson checks-in on a customer during a meal, ""Everything okay?"", something like that, but this was over the top; it finally became annoying. I was sitting there thinking, ""Oh, gawd, here she comes, again."" She clearly was trolling for tips.

6,Joshua A.,"Nampa, ID",57,3,1.0,1.0,2017-08-22,"I ordered a bacon burger based on the picture and I understand it won't always look like that but my bacon looked NOTHING close to the concept of that burger. Had I known, I would have just gotten the regular burger. No visit from the manager even with me bringing it up. I paid full price and I was okay with that because that's what I ordered, but not even a hey sorry we ran out of the real bacon and we had to use this junk.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nampa,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
2,Diane O.,"Denver, CO",36,109,81.0,1.0,2017-08-22,"After 7 days outside at a festival, all I wanted was a delicious hot meal. While the ordering online, to go, was useful, overall everything about the food was awful. My boyfriend got the mac and cheese double burger- the burger came with only 1 patty and about 7 fries. He also got nachos which were soaked in grease, hard cheese, and lacking in toppings.  I ordered the grilled cheese and side salad.  I'm not sure if it was because we ordered ""to-go"" or just that they were 30 minutes from closing, but the grilled cheese was awful. The clump of cheese wasn't even melted and the bread was buttered in one small area and barely toasted at all. Then there was hardened cheese on one side of the bread. It was completely gross and a huge dissapountment after 7 days outside and 8 hours on the road. Just awful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nampa,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
4,Adam N.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",53,15,1.0,4.0,2017-08-31,Great place to eat. Don't come here a lot but this time it was a bit of a wait for a chicken salad. The salad was good. Would order it again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nampa,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6
3,Kindra M.,"Caldwell, ID",6,19,,1.0,2017-10-21,"This review is for the ToGo service. Absolute crap from the start. They messed up the order twice giving us wrong drinks and not following the directions in the notes. The prices are the same for smaller portions than what you would get inside. Our order ""wasn't ready"" but brought out cold food. My husband had to walk in 3 different times because they never gave him his drink, our silverware, or the ranch for my salad. We ordered fried mushrooms and it honestly looked like wheat thins! Haha it was a bunch of fried batter, no mushrooms. I enjoy my experience at Red Robin, however I will never order ToGo from here EVER again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nampa,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
0,Jewel S.,"Nampa, ID",0,17,67.0,5.0,2017-12-22,I tried the honey chicken wings. They were yummy. The burgers are also always a good pick. The milk shakes are good but they don't give you enough even when you order the monster shake. It seems like they have gotten more expensive lately but the food is always tasty.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nampa,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
1,Patrick M.,"Elk Grove, CA",58,117,3.0,1.0,2017-12-29,"Filthy. Carpet is sticky, bathroom sinks are moldy, table is sticky. Sent my drink back because there were mouth food particles in it. Plate had remnants of a previous diner's entree on it. Cold fries. Burger was a disheveled mess, and had a soggy bun. About 25% occupied on a Friday evening, so there is a bad sign too. Stay away. The management here needs to be fired. If you need to spend 40.00 for two burgers which are less than you would get at Carl's Jr., this is your spot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nampa,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
