46,Jenn Z.,"Nashville, TN",137,111,23.0,4.0,2012-03-01,"Red Robin was a favorite of mine growing up in So Cal, typically where we would go to gather for a Birthday or some sort of get together mainly because they offer so many different burgers! So I was excited when they expanded to Nashville, and at Nashville West to boot since I love this shopping center.  I was a long time fan of the chicken burgers, have had almost every one on the menu each one is a hefty serving and delivios now that I am not a meat eater, I opt for the Gardenburger. Red Robin will put pretty much any topping on your burger you have available, so dressing it up is easy.  Wait....I am forgetting the bottomless steak fries! Yes, you can have bottomless fries for your entire visit! Although a single basket is typically enough, we have on occasion ordered a basket as an appetizer and you aren't charged extra. They have their own seasoning salt at each table as well that adds a bit of kick to them and is just salty enough too.  Recently they changed some items on the menu but the staples are there, and they now have wraps and salads. You can order any burger or sandwich lettuce wrapped, and have melon as a side (cantaloupe is one of my faves!). They also started offering sweet potato fries for an up-charge, I ordered them and my first batch was cold, but the waitress kindly brought me a hot fresh order. They were okay, but nothing I would order again, I will stick with the steak fries next visit.  The kids meal menu is one of the best I have experienced while eating out, they actually have options and side items that include healthy salads, oranges, carrots and melon and each are reasonably priced including a drink.  Overall if you are looking for a very family and pocket book friendly option for dinner, this is a great place. You not going to experience grass fed local beef, local artisan cheese and buns from the local bakery, this is a chain but its' still good eats.  I have always experienced excellent service at this location as well and will return again and again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nashville?start=40,3.3440000000000003,3.3440000000000003,3.3440000000000003,3.3440000000000003,3.3440000000000003

43,Dae R.,"Madison, TN",0,39,,1.0,2013-08-04,"I have gone to this restaurant with several groups of people, on vastly different occasions. The food was good (mostly), however the service was crap! On just about every occasion the wait staff has been rude and uncaring about the service they are providing.  For instance, when I went about a year ago with a friend/co-worker, the server was very quick to come and take our drink orders. However she rolled her eyes and huffed when we didn't immediately know what we wanted to eat...we'd only gotten seated 5min prior to her showing up. During this same dining experience, our  table order took 30min to get from the kitchen. Our seats weren't directly facing the kitchen, but I could see well enough inside the area to note the plates/baskets sitting out to be grabbed by the servers. Our order had been sitting out for at least 10-15min., so it was lukewarm by the time it got to us. My second experience occurred 8 months later, and was just as bad! I went with a group of family and friends. We did have a large order, so we asked for a little more time, which was granted. 30min no one had come back to ask if we were ready, and our drink order that had been put in before hadn't arrived. After we did get out drinks and put in out food order, it took another 40min to get out order, which came back either wrong, missing parts, or both. When this was pointed out to the server, she went to the kitchen to get our things. Some stuff was brought out, and some wasn't. In fact, some of our food didn't get to us until the end of our meal, and when this fact was brought up to the wait staff, they pretty much shrugged and charged us anyway. I would definitely understand the screw-ups and long wait time during busy hours. However, there's only been at maximum 20 patrons filling the whole place each time I've gone there. To add insult, there were tables that came in after us that received food well before us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nashville?start=40,3.68,3.68,3.68,2.6920000000000006,3.6800000000000006

Food poisoning, bad service, talked to management and corporate, no one cared and nothing was done to correct it. The waitress didn't believe she could make a mistake. When I told her my food was wrong I was given attitude and I'm very concerned that they did something to my food because I asked for what I ordered instead of what I received. The manager sounded sincere, but, aside from an ""I'm sorry"" nothing else. Corporate promised a gift card, wow like I want to eat there again, but it never came. Apparently no one else that night got sick so they didn't believe me, which is why I was concerned more about them tainting my order.

This location is good, but consistently not up to par with Mt Juliet or Murfreesboro, and even Knoxville one time when we were driving through. It never feels really clean when you walk in, and the servers are never great.  Last night with a group of girlfriends were were a 4 top in the bar and our server was Heather.  Heather let drinks run out three times (cocktails, no less, where the tab would've gone up), and was just generally slow.  We ordered desserts that did not look like the photos on the menu (not huge deals, but the chocolate cake was supposed to have strawberry sauce on the bottom, and didn't... and the red velvet cake was supposed to have a drizzle of strawberry sauce on the bottom, and it was COVERED).  Being the one who got the soppy, sweet strawberry red velvet cake I wouldn't like to have discussed it (not good, by the way, ignore the photo yumminess), but by the time she came back it was a mute point. Then I ordered hubby a ""to go"" burger where after saying ""no fries"" - she convinced me to order a side salad since I'd be charged for a side anyway.  Imagine my surprise when I got home and there was no salad.  Not a huge deal... but really?

From the beginning the waitress was telling us how it's the best burger she's ever eaten and how there's nothing on the menu she didn't like, but she obviously doesn't get out much. It was a pretty good burger but most definitely not the best I've ever had. I decided to try the garlic and cheese seasoned fries to go with my burger. It cost a little extra for them as opposed to their normal fries. The only difference I see in these fries and the normal ones were that they shook some kind of cheesy garlic seasoning on the fries, which doesn't really make them special and doesn't really justify the extra couple dollars, although they did taste okay. I also decided to try one of their special sauces, which cost an extra 75 cents. So they brought me out a little cup of this sauce, kind of like a barbecue bacon ketchup. It was actually pretty good, but they really don't give you enough of it. When I got my burger nothing was wrong so everything came out of the kitchen correct. It was pretty good but definitely not one of the best I have ever had like the waitress was saying. I might go back but it would have to be like a second or third choice kind of thing.

If you decide to play with said computer while waiting on your food, etc. you will be charged at the end of your meal a $2.19 ENTERTAINMENT FEE. When I asked our waitress what this fee was she said she had no idea and guessed it was for the new computer sitting on the table.  It also can take your order and you can pay your bill through the machine. As I was redeeming my reward you supposedly can do that too on the machine but it wouldn't work for me and the waitress had to do it for me.  The computer did however tell me that my tip was higher than my ENTERTAINMENT FEE. My opinion is that I should have been warned before I touched the computer that I would be charged instead of seeing a fee added onto my bill at the end.  I won't be back.  Happy Birthday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nashville?start=40,3.36,3.36,3.36,2.44,3.3600000000000003

Before you lay into me about why I'm at a burger joint and don't eat meat, my friends wanted burgers so I was along for the ride.  Of course with everything on the burger I took a bite before realizing they had brought a beef burger.  When I pointed it out, they made me another burger but by then my dining companions were finished eating.  And they charged me for the wrong burger.  With two types of veggie burgers and several options for them on the menu, they should be able to bring out the correct one.  So that's my ""beef""!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-nashville,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92

Our server Jacob was far from great. He was full of excuses and was not attentive at all.  I think we asked 3-4 times for a side of ranch. Ended up having to ask another server for it. Jacob kept saying he was going to busy with his next table, so Merry was going to be helping him. Helping is an understatement. When our food came I asked for a side of honey mustard which ended up being brought by someone else as well.  The one thing is our drinks did stay full. Food was alright.

It is really a high end fast food establishment and no longer a service restaurant. The staff do not service the table unless you call them over. Had to call the wait staff just to order. (About 15min) We received the incorrect drinks, had ordered a well done burger but received a medium rare (bloody center). This was removed and replaced with no accommodation. I am writing this at the restaurant table and I see we are being billed for the uncooked burger that was returned. This was corrected but with all the other errors it made for a bad ending. Of the 4 meals we ordered 3 were good. The chicken sandwich, chicken strips and southwest salad were good. The burger was not charred as a good burger joint would cook.

Seen she treats other servers like crap but is sure favored by gm. Food is usually good but prices keep going up. Too bad servers get crap led on by owner or gm.

After the 3rd visit over the course of 6 months, we now know how slow and poor the service is. We were seated promptly which we were happy about, and it was probably because the place was not busy at all. Plenty of room was left in the restaurant. We waited about 30-45 minutes before we received our food. Our server Robin was busy with other tables and didn't even ask us how our food was when we definitely were not happy with what we received.  Both my husband and I ordered burgers (with pink in the middle) and garlic fries. Our burgers came out fully cooked through, no pink and the buns were cold. Our fries came out shortly and sadly, they could hardly be called garlic fries. There were a couple strands of shredded parmesan and about 3 leaves of parsley on the 5 individual steak fries we received. The fact that we are paying extra for garlic fries to have them come out and be a sad excuse for garlic fries was very irritating. When we were going to let the server know how we felt, we used the ziosk to call the server and waited 11 minutes before the server even engaged us and decided we just wanted to leave. We almost walked out because the service was so bad. I'd like to think we are pretty gracious and patient people and this place tested both. We were finished with having to deal with the poor service and paid for our food via the ziosk and left.
