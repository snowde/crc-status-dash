I have been wanting to try this place since I moved to Newnan. It did not disappoint. While the burgers were 10 dollars a piece....I was so excited after my first bite I can't even begin to tell you.

There is even a tv in the floor where you wait for a hostes, I guess for those who have the attention of a fly. Amusing nonetheless. The burgers were great, they all run about 10 bucks and come with bottomless steak fries. I had the chopsteak and my brother had the bleu, both had french fried onions on them, both made us wish they lasted longer. The soft drinks are 2.59 and were refilled about 6 times on our visit.

They sent me a birthday coupon to use during the month of June expires at the end of the months. I don't normally eat here so I decided to call ahead to place my order I explained on the phone that I was using my Free birthday coupon. The told me ok it would be about 15 min. I waited in my car. When I went to the bar to get my order. The bar tender call the manager Jessica over. Jessica told her not to allow me to use my birthday coupon cause they have another promotion going on which was 20% off.  She stated that I had until the end of August to us the birthday coupon. I politely left the food and called back to get the general manger number. I explained to him that if they didn't want me to use the coupon they shouldn't have sent it to me. I felt like they should have told me that I could use it from the beginning when I placed my order. I will be back to get my free burger. And am not going back until they send me another free coupon.

38,Aaron W.,"Belle Chasse, LA",0,38,,2.0,2016-02-28,"First off, everything tasted great.  Our waitress worked her ass off.  The problem is that our order that included bottomless fries came with about the equivalent of a small fry at McDonald's.  Not exaggerating.  Immediately asked her to put in our refill order, and 10 minutes later an even smaller order of fries came out.  Now I am two orders in, been here for an hour and a half, and I'm less full than a normal burger meal at chili's.  I get that you don't want to waste food? But my 10 year old finished her 'adult' order of fries in a matter of a couple of minutes.  These poor waitresses are run ragged trying to constantly bring out 8-10 French fries at a time.  It's fairly pricey here.  Bring out a normal size order of fries on the first order, and I probably won't even ask for seconds.  After 2 orders (and over an hour waiting for them), I haven't had a 'normal' order yet, so I'm just annoyed and want to take it out on the poor waitress.   Sadly, won't be coming back.  Burger was small but tasted good.  Server was awesome, but service was terrible.  This place is busy, so I guess they won't care.  Not how I would run a place to keep people coming back.

The time the food was Great ,but the experience was aweful. We went on a weekday around early lunch time. There were hardly any customers in the restaurant. When we arrived there was no greeter at the front. It took 5 minutes before someone came to the front to greet us. And the lady tried to seat us in a booth right by the bathrooms, when no one was even there. It was plenty of seating in other areas and. I advised her that we would like to be seated somewhere else. The two waitresses that I saw were both dirty in appearance. There uniform shirts were dirty looking and our waitresses hair looked greasy and unkempt. As a employee you are representing the business and in food service you should want to look your best. You are servicing customers and presentation is everything.  But this wasn't the worst of it all. There was a couple behind us with a German shephard service dog. She asked if she could pet him. And she did. She was all in his face and rubbing him all over.  I watched her all the way back to the food pickup area and she never once washed her hands.  I will never go back there again .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-newnan?start=20,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5640000000000005,3.0000000000000004

Some guy came up wearing a dirty black tee shirt and eventually seated us. Right off we noticed that the place was filthy. The floors were nasty and several tables haven't been cleaned off. The place smelled very strongly of what I can only describe as dirty mop bucket water. Our server seemed as though she would rather be somewhere else and when told it was my little girls birthday and that she had specially requested to come to this place she seemed uninterested. She did ask if my little girl would like birthday ice cream, of course my little girl said yes. When we received our meals, my ciabatta bun for my burger was cut lop sidedly. The bacon on the burger was thin, brittle, and tasted like it had been sitting around a while. After we finish our meal we were hoping my daughter would receive her birthday ice cream.

Some repeat.  Some have prices. Some do not.  I finally narrowed it down to one that sounded like it was not smothered in sugar.  Wrong!  Pepper aioli was corn syrup based.  Oops. What was the $1.99 entertainment fee for?  If it were a ""cold draft from the window fee"" or an ""extra achy belly fee"" I'd understand. Then the tabletop kiosk that's supposed to make things faster wouldn't charge my card.  Had to press the ""call the waitress"" button again.
