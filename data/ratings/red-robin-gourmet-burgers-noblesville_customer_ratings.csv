Menu consists of many different burgers, sandwiches, salads, fried snacks and deserts.  Lots of beverage choices including beer, wine, and liquor as well as kid friendly drinks.  My burger was cooked perfect with creative toppings, the garden burger patty melt was said to be very tasty, and kids menu chicken strips and fries were standard.  Apparently they serve bottomless fries which is cool.  The onion rings were breaded not battered which is a change from the usual and served without dipping sauce but easily retrieved upon request.  Side salad looked nice as well.  Fresh Sam Adams Boston lager on tap served in matching glassware was a plus.  Price was $40 before gratuity which seemed costly for the food but the service and quality justified the bill.  I would gladly go again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-noblesville?start=40,2.7039999999999997,2.7039999999999997,2.7039999999999997,2.7039999999999997,2.7039999999999997

11,Rachael B.,"Pendleton, IN",3,16,2.0,5.0,2015-08-13,I love Red Robins. My favorite appetizer is the pretzel bites with cheese. Their onion rings are a good starter as well.  I'm not normally a burger girl but I love their Whiskey River Barbecue burger cooked medium. Their fries are thick cut but you can substitute them for onion rings if you do not like that.  They have a pretty good dessert menu but many of the desserts are too big for one person so be careful.  The atmosphere is noisy and sometimes feels a little chaotic but the bar area is quieter.

10,Elizabeth C.,"Indianapolis, IN",0,5,,1.0,2015-08-17,"Red Robin used to be a family-favorite restaurant if not for anything else but for a great atmosphere and the kids like the bottomless mac'n'cheese and fries. The rest of the menu is overwhelmingly consistent, but you don't go there for the world's best burger or anything else. That said, since the recent re-branding of Red Robin we returned twice, and have been disappointed both times.  The first is the issue with the kids' bottomless mac'n'cheese, which is no longer an option. On our first visit, the mac'n'cheese was cold and because my kids anticipated a second bowl, they scarfed down the first bowl only to be told that the second bowl was not an option.  The only thing they were happy about was the bottomless fries, only to find about ten steak fries in the bowl and which were gone rather quickly. They didn't want to appear as gluttons so they didn't ask for more. My issue was with the sweet potato fries -- supposedly an upgrade. The serving size was smaller and they, too, were cold. We returned last night with friends and the same issue presented itself. The strawberry lemonade was served in a glass with so much ice that there were literally two sips in the glass before it needed to be refilled.

Furthermore, we have yet to get napkins and or utensils without first asking in any of our several visits (who needs napkins anyway?)

Maybe it's because I used to be a waitress, but poor service really gets to me. We were seated in the bar area. For a Friday night, it was really pretty bare in the restaurant. We sat at our table for a solid 10 minutes with nary a glance our way from any of the Red Robin staff. It wasn't until my friend pressed the ""call server"" button, and our machine started blinking red (but couldn't actually call the server because our table hadn't been programmed in to the computer yet) that someone noticed us. The host came by, said he would be back, and left. About 5 minutes later, our server arrives. He kind of apologized. He said no one told him he had a table, and management had let another server go for the night, so he didn't know this table was his. ""Sorry for the confusion"". Ok, fine. We order our drinks and food. Don't see him again. Someone else brings the drinks, someone else brings the food. The food took an extremely long time to come out. When it got to our table finally, the fries were cold. Cold fries are the worst! I'd also like to mention the whole time it's like we're sitting in the arctic. It was seriously freezing in there. My friend said something to our waiter about how cold the restaurant was. It was so cold you could almost consider it uncomfortable. He told her ""I can get my manager, but there's nothing he's gonna do about it"". And then proceeds to tell us that the dehumidifier is broken, so if they don't keep the air on full blast, condensation forms on the floor. I guess the floors were so wet, someone fell. So, now this system. The manager apparently had a timer on his phone, and every 45 minutes he would turn the air off in order to warm the place up a bit. Know what's worse than being freezing? When they turn the air all the way off, and you have stale restaurant air not moving around the building, and 98% humidity. Really not the most fun we've had.

The fries was also cold so I ask for more.  The waiter tries to tell us it took so long because we order it Well Done.  I don't mine the wait but I do mind it being  cold when it got to us. I saw several people get there food before us. They came in at least 5 or 10 minutes after us. They did have a differ waiter therefore it was our waiter that wasn't doing her job.  I wanted to talk to the manager but my wife told me to let it go.

We waited 15 minutes for a table at the bar and watched other people walk in and seat themselves? I asked and this bar is not open seating. We then had a rude waitress walk by and say she needed to see our IDs and then walk off. We then waited another 15 minutes for her to come back to get our order and check our IDs and that never happened!! She instead took orders for 3 tables that sat themselves after us. We walked out and went to McDonalds for better service.

41,Jackson L.,"Greenwood, IN",24,83,36.0,3.0,2017-03-23,"Red Robin is a pretty decent choice for burgers. They're definitely nothing special, the bottomless fries are unnecessary, but if you just want a place that makes a good beef patty and puts it on a bun, they're here for you.  I still have to say that while I was excited the first time I went, subsequent visits have been a little less impressive each time. Today, I thought I'd go a little off-script and choose a non-traditional burger offering. Now, I love burgers. If I could only eat one thing for the rest of my life, it would be a burger. So when I say off-script, I mean it. Maybe I was in a rut here. Maybe something out of the ordinary was required to reimpress me. I chose the Citrus Harissa Salmon burger, a bold new option on the Gourmet Burger page.  I should have chosen differently.  I happen to also love salmon, but this really did not work. The fish flakes too much to be between two stiff buns. It just ended up as mush and fell out the sides. The aioli was far too thick for something as light tasting as salmon, so the whole thing ended up as an overly flowery, complicated mess that I finished with a fork. The fish was good alone. I was surprised it was as well cooked at a place that doesn't specialize in seafood. But the dish as a whole, with the exception of the addition of arugula to the sandwich (perfect choice, chefs), was a disappointment.  None of this is nearly enough to make me stop going. This is a place that, in my experience, consistently delivers what you expect going in, assuming you're already familiar. It's worth a try if you've never gone, and it's a solid choice to keep on the back burner if you run out of options. Sometimes there are a lot of unchecked kids running amok in the waiting area, but the restaurant attracts families, and I enjoy that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-noblesville,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76

What would have been a 30 minute meal turned into being held hostage for about an hour and a half.  Not an enjoyable experience, and not something I ever want to repeat.  Excellent way to ruin a Friday evening.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-noblesville,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52

I have been here a few times and chose them today because I really wanted some bottomless fries and a cold beer. Friday about 6:30pm and had no problem getting seated. Our waitress, SavannahK, was very energetic and took care of getting our drink order right away. They offer a 32oz mug of draft beer so I decided to have a very large beer to cap off a busy Friday.  I had Blue Moon and since it was so big, they automatically garnished it with 2 large orange wedges. I then ordered the BBQ burger. When it came, the burger looked great but there weren't many fries on the plate. I immediately asked for additional fries. The waitress came back twice and realized I hadn't gotten them yet but I was done with my fries and burger before my additional fries came. That was the most disappointing thing about the experience.
