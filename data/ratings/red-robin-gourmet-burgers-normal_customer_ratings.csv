36,Darrell S.,"Lexington, IL",6,81,68.0,3.0,2015-06-10,"First trip here as they have just opened and was very busy but got seated within 15 minutes at prime time for lunch. Grabbed a seat at the bar and was greeted promptly by the bartender who took our orders and was helpful and friendly. Menu is large with lots of selections for burgers, not a lot of low calorie options but some decent looking ones. My rating would be higher but this place suffers from the typical chain (Applebee, Chili's) approach that is ok to charge $13 for a Hamburger so expect a $15 or more lunch. Unfortunately Bloomington Normal has a quite competitive restaurant market and you can get as good or better burger/lunch for half the price at a number of places (Merna, Cheeks, Smashburger, Mugsys) so if your looking for value this is not the place. I had the Whiskey River BBQ chicken wrap and the flavor was good, a little much sauce made it uneatable towards the end of the wrap but really liked the smoky bbq flavor of the chicken. You get choice of fries or fruit and trying to be healthy I went with the fruit and that was a mistake as it was full of syrup like canned fruit not fresh tasting at all. Again for the prices they are charging here I expected more. So stick with the fries as I tasted my buddies and they were good steak fries a little undercooked but good tasting. The bartender and manager both asked how our meals were and took our feedback but like most chains they are powerless to do anything about menu prices or changing the fruit supplier. You can run over to Walmart and get a fresh fruit tray and serve that as a side and it would be much better :). So overall not a bad place to try and will eventually make it back to try different dishes but this is not going to be at the top of my list when trying to decide where to go for eats in the BloNo area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-normal?start=20,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998
40,Dustin F.,"Bloomington, IL",7,40,17.0,3.0,2015-06-21,"This place is very pricey and not one I'd go to often. First off, I went with my sister and grandma. My sister got the Banzai burger, my grandma and I got the red robin gourmet burger.  My sister and grandma also ate the towering onion rings which were good! My grandma got the orange cream soda, me and my sister got the purple poppin lemonade. It was sweet and flavorful to the point we downed a few glasses of it.  As far as service went the server was awesome and requested refills for our fries and drinks right away. The only issue is our server was having an issue getting our checks split.    I'd have to say the price was the big killer for my review, not the food. Also, the wait time was another negative to this review as well. I get it's new and we did so on Father's Day weekend, but a 20 minute or so wait or longer had customers leave. We only stayed because we had a bit of time and wished to try it. All in all, I'd go when the hype dies down and if you have extra time along with extra money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-normal?start=20,2.252,2.252,2.252,2.252,2.252

The host took our name when we arrived, but when it was time to seat us, she just kept saying ""you guys"" until we figured out she was talking to us.   Our server Landon, kept making trips to the table before taking a drink order. I think it was trip 3 or 4 he finally got to getting our order.  My order did not come as ordered, but nothing was done to correct it.  The fries that are supposedly endless took forever to get, and when we finally did get a refill there were about 10. The sweet potato fries were over cooked as well, and the menu doesn't illustrate that there was a price increase for substituting this option, nor did the server specify this.

37,Josh S.,"Bloomington, IL",0,8,,1.0,2015-07-01,"Highly disappointed. First time at any Red Robin.  Service was awful - had to ask for silverware and napkins, had to ask for refills (which took around 15 minutes to get), only saw our server every 15 minutes.  Waited almost one hour for 2 burgers, chicken sandwich and salad.  My burger, the A1 Peppercorn, was subpar, not very flavorful, just so,so.  The other burger I was told was just ok.  The chicken sandwich was cold and chewy and only covered a small portion of the bun.  ""Bottomless"" fries = kids size fries (didn't even try and ask for more as I knew it would take a while).  A couple of employees were pretty impolite as well.

42,John S.,"Bloomington, IL",5,8,,3.0,2015-07-03,Mixed review on this place.  This is my second visit here.  First visit was the week they opened.  Everything ran like a charm the first time.  Several members of the corporate team checked on our experience.  It appears the corporate team is gone and they are flying solo.  The kitchen took too long to get our food out.  Perhaps it was because three members of the kitchen staff were in the bathroom checking their phones and chatting about sports.  The quality of the burgers was not to Red Robin standards.  My A1 peppercorn burger was made without some ingredients.  Our server Jackson quickly remedied this.  My dinner companion's Royal Red Robin burger had the runniest undercooked egg I've ever seen.  He just dealt with it.  The service is good.  Kitchen needs some work.  I'm certain this will be remedied as they are open longer.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-normal?start=20,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997,2.1239999999999997
12,Pete R.,"Bloomington, IL",13,99,153.0,2.0,2015-07-05,"Second visit warrants a review. First visit was on the 2nd weekday after opening and it was predictably WAY too crowded (like any new BloNo restaurant, which ought to tell people how starved we are for more options).  This visit was a lazy, late afternoon Sunday - not overly crowded in the bar. I say that, yet somehow, the staff (bar staff in particular) was still inexplicably 'too busy'. After watching a little closer they seem to put their barkeep in the middle of employee check-in, dessert-making, gossip, phone/carry-outs and a few tables in the bar, in addition to their more typical bartending duties. This means even when there are 3 or more of them behind the bar, there never seem to be enough?!  Which means those of us who like to dine at the bar are relegated to an after-thought.  And when you're an after-thought, bottomless anything doesn't seem so appealing, i.e. when it takes 10 minutes or more, to get another helping of whatever.  We like the decor, including the granite bar, the extensive menu and the bar TVs (altho 1 is apparently dedicated to infomercials!). But in addition to the disappointment in tap options (see my 'Tip', no real 'craft' here) and pricing (went with the $10 'tavern-style' thin double patties this time), the place can best be described as an over-priced burger joint where nothing really stands out, not even the burgers which I would describe as creative, overly saucy, and clearly over-priced.  After waiting another 10 mins to 'tab out', going forward we will opt for more efficiency, more tap choice and better value!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-normal,2.088,2.088,2.088,2.088,2.088

I had to force myself to try something different since their menu is full of items that look delicious. My only big complaint is that the appetizers are expensive - and small.

By no means was it the best burger I've had, but it was still a solid meal. I'd stick with the gourmet burgers not go near the regular cheaper ones. Also I love the bottomless fries especially with the honey mustard they have! Over all a pretty great meal! The service was also very friendly and helpful. I just wish they hadn't seated us near a bunch of families with kids.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-normal,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68
18,D S.,"Normal, IL",3,49,,2.0,2017-03-05,"I have a very bad habit which is ""eating out."" My daughter and I go back and fourth regarding where we should eat. She prefers I cook but that's not an option but it really needs to become one. I thought well let's go to Red Robin after finding out about the burger special. As I pull into the parking lot I see two employees out back smoking. We walk into Red Robin's and there's a line of people waiting to be acknowledged & seated. We're all standing there for a few minutes then someone finally pops up at to greet us....it's the guy that was out back smoking a cigarette. He looked as if he could have been a manager. So there's people waiting and you're out back smoking a cigarette. I can't judge the food because I decided that we'll have a burger @ chili's once I took a closer look @ the guy who came in from smoking to greet us...let's just say I'm not sure if he was really smoking cigarettes. He just had an odd look...maybe he was tired. I felt more comfortable going elsewhere. I enjoyed my meal @ Chili's. Also the server Tish was awesome. I excellent customer service",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-normal,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72

26,Steve B.,"Bloomington, IL",0,5,,3.0,2017-05-05,Third time I have ate at this Red Robin and it was no better than the last 2!  Busy on cinco de mayo so I understand the slower service but the waiter did not know types of margaritas.  Towards the end of our meal he asked if I wanted more fries and I said sure. He came back 15 minutes later with a check and said we could pay him with cash or pay with card at the table. I asked about the fries and bam out came the hottest food of the night.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-normal?start=20,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
4,Domingo M.,"Washington, IL",4,58,,2.0,2017-05-31,"The quality of the food is okay.  But they totally misrepresent the portion sizes of the hamburgers.  They are a LOT smaller than I'd expect from the menu description and the price.  A $10 burger should be better and bigger than what they give you at this place.  Seriously...the ""pig out"" version of the burger I got was no bigger than a Mcdonald's quarter pounder and only came with 3 pieces of bacon.   Red Robbin isn't the trendy place it used to be either.  It's morphed into a Applebee's like clone, complete with the feel of the Office Space ""Flingers"" joint.  I did not feel like wearing ANY pieces of flair here and clearly neither did the waitress who rolled her eyes when I complained about the size of my burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-normal,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
7,Alexander G.,"Bloomington, IL",0,11,,2.0,2017-06-24,"Just another burger at burger avenue a.k.a college avenue. The burgers are ok, but highly overpriced. We got the unlimited fries, but the waitress only brought us two orders, don't waste your money, you won't get more than a couple of helpings.  Better and cheaper burgers on the same street, lol.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-normal,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
6,Jay S.,"Normal, IL",0,33,,1.0,2017-06-26,"The burgers are good but unless you get the tavern ones they are WAY over priced.  Also the endless fries are only as good as they have them ready.  Our one re-order took like 8 or 9 minutes.  I guess that is one way to control how many the customers get.  We had an odd issue with gnats or fruit flies at our table as well.  I killed probably 4 of them.  The final kick in the pants is the crappy pay at the table kiosks.  Those damned things NEVER print a receipt so the server had to go get it.  Just frigging take my card and run it for me!  A sit down restaurant that is self serve to pay.  Total BS.  Guess I don't need to tip as much if I have to run my own card.  I doubt I'll be back much which is too bad.  It's only three blocks from our office.  For me, you can keep your over priced burgers, crappy payment machines, and your fruit flies. Wow why the hell do I keep coming back to this place? Overpriced and you can't get a pen to sign your damn credit card receipt because they want you to use the stupid kiosks at the table that never work.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-normal,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64

11,Rob S.,"Virden, IL",4,11,1.0,2.0,2017-07-27,"$20+ is entirely too much for a slightly above average burger and fries. The endless steak fries are nice, but doesn't justify the price. I also moved the game screen and accidentally hit a button. That cost me $2 because the button was for a ""premium"" game. You know....like the ones for free most phones have. They were busy so I just paid it and left. Do away with that gimmick. Make your burgers worthy of the price tag.

1,Ka Y.,"San Diego, CA",0,14,23.0,1.0,2017-09-15,"I will state: I went into the location to purchase a gift card. I waited at the reception desk while three hostesses look ""deer in headlights"" over a family of six. One of which had absolutely no idea what planet she was on.  I went to the bar so I could purchase the gift card. As I arrived, I noticed a ""to go order"" customer standing so I asked how long she'd been there .... Red Robin ""lost"" her order. It was never entered into the computer I'm assuming.  The manager was prompt with helping her.  The bartender acknowledged me. Yet she continued to pour drink tickets. Stood there for another 5 minutes. Thanks to the manager who finally asked me if I'd been helped. ...that's when I finally was able to get my purchase completed.  If the service is this shitty for a gift card, I'll avoid wasting my time for a sit down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-normal,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
0,Ethan L.,"Normal, IL",86,33,1.0,4.0,2017-10-17,"I'm going to preface this review by coming out. I have a condition, I'm a freckled lemonade addict. The addiction started back when I was a toddler. Once I had that sweet sweet nectar I was an addict for life. I unfortunately don't come to Red Robin much anymore because my fiancé doesn't care for them much. I on the other hand couldn't love anywhere else more. I came here today with my work team and got the Hawaiian Burger with onion rings as a side. The Good -Service is usually great. Always attentive and never make me feel like I'm an inconvenience. -In my opinion their onion rings are some of the best out there, bar none. No one else has breading like theirs. -BOTTOMLESS SIDES. Almost all of their sides are bottomless, so bring your appetite. -Their sauces are pretty good! -They have a low carb options for all their sandwiches! -Freckled lemonade!! They even have a lo cal version. -Great fries! The Not So Good -They put BBQ sauce on the bottom of my burger which made it get soggy pretty quickly and messy. -Prices are not the best. If you want one of their better burgers it's $13-$15. -Their burgers are okay, but nothing to write home about. I grew up being a Red Robin kid, I'll always love them. They have a ton of options which allows even the pickiest of eaters to eat there.While they have some areas to improve in, they have a lot of things going for them that make them unique and a great place to eat!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-normal,2.84,2.84,2.84,,2.84
