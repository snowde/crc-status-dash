Waitress was overly sugary sweet and brought a large rather than small onion tower appetizer and three of us ordered bacon burgers that were slightly undercooked.

62,John S.,"Chicago, IL",1,9,,1.0,2013-10-22,"So we went to check out the new  Red Robin at the Harlem Irving Mall this week. The hostess told us that we would not have to wait in the lobby for 20 minutes, they'd just text us when a table would be available to me and we'd have 10 minutes to return.Sounded like a simple plan. After over 30 minutes walking the mall starving, we returned to the Red Robin to check our table status. We asked if we had been called since it had been 48 minutes since we had signed up for a table. ""Um, I think we just called you"" the hostess said as she scrolled through her touch pad. While I am still waiting to see if I have a table yet, a woman walks in and starts asking how she can get a table. ""well just give me your cell number and we'll text you when a table is available.""says the hostess to this other woman as if I am no longer interested in dining there. ""well, I don't have a cell phone"" says the woman speaking around my shoulder..As they still are discussing how this other lady is going to get her table,After a while, I remind the hostess that she had left us hanging there after an hour wait time now. The hostess blinked her eyes and apologized. My blood sugar is SO low now all I can say  is ""This is bullshit!"" The 23 year old manager with the red mustache then told me that my wife and I had to leave for swearing.I wouldn't be swearing if any of the employees of the new Red Robin had been properly trained.  I guess a mass hiring on Monster. Com had it's ups and downs. So I hope that the manager whom I believe they recruited from Wisconsin is very proud of himself for chastising me instead of his employees.What Red Robin corporate doesn't yet know is that I will never spend a dime in this location EVER again!

78,John L.,"Chicago, IL",0,3,,1.0,2013-11-19,"NOT happy with the new Red Robin at the H.I.P.  At the Bears game this weekend everyone with a ticket won a free burger at Red Robin restaurants this Tuesday. Everyone won, all thousands of ticket holders won a free burger with their ticket. So my buddy Chris who got me the ticket to the Bears game came over tonight so we would try out the new Red Robin and get our free burgers. I called Red Robin before going and they confirmed that they were giving free burgers with the Bears tickets. Chris and I get there and the servers act as though they do not know why I am giving them the tickets or anything about the free burgers. We explain to them that we get free burgers and we called ahead of time to confirm this and then the server tells us that it is only the double thin burger from the bar. O.K. by us, no problem. But then she says that it is only one burger per table even though each of us has a Bears ticket. I do not go for this B.S. and she calls a manager over. He says that it is buy one burger to get the second burger free. I again do not go for this expanded B.S. and then he comes up with you have to buy one burger and two drinks to get the free burger ! We walked on principle. F*** Red Robin ! I will not go back and they are stupid to treat me this way because now I have a cause.

Then after I corrected her on her mistake, she claims due to their ""company rules"" my vertical drivers license cannot be accepted only because it is not horizontal.

80,Lee R.,"River Forest, IL",0,5,,5.0,2013-12-04,I am quite a hamburger lover.  This place just blew me away.  The flavor of the burgers are perfect.  I think it is because they toast the bun with Margarine.  Would prefer butter but oh well.  I don't even get it with Mayo so I imagine that it is even more delicious.  I have only tried the basic Gourmet Cheeseburger and the Sweet Potato fries so far.  Want to try some others as well for the future.  The staff is really nice and went out of their way to be accommodating.  Nice beer selection as well which is a big plus.  The fact that the mall has a Chipotle and a Panera is another added bonus if you like those 2 franchises.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-norridge?start=80,2.612,2.612,2.612,2.612,2.6120000000000005

Definitely to much load for her to handle alone.    Suddenly a Manager went behind the bar for what ever reason, and the Bartender says to him LOUD FOR ME TO HEAR, Oh, guess what I apparently need help, looked at me with a dirty look, at this time the foods came she took it from the waiter that had brought it over and starts making comments to me to mind my own business loudly and ranting some other remarks as I turn and walk out she is still now raising her voice as i am walking away,  OMG, Sunday Bartender , Ignorant, Rude, Immature, Needs desperate Customer Service lessons , Dirty, Sloppy, NEED SOMEONE MORE PROFESSIONAL.  To top it all off , when I finally got home,  My side orders literately  were about a 10 oz cup, SWEAR TO GOD filled about 1 1/2 oz. less than 1/4 of the cup, It reminded me of when you buy a bag of potato chips and the bags blown up with air , and when you open it there 4 chips in there,   NEEDLESS TO SAY SORRY NEVER EVER RETURNING THERE, PLUS THE PRICES ARE RIDICULES.

McDonald's has better burgers then this place and my early dinner felt later as if I ate at McDonald's! Large up charge for garlic fries which were there normal not so amazing fries tossed in a boat load of oil with alittle garlic!!

I went out and I saw an employee using the bathroom and in my head I'm thinking why aren't you guys doing anything about it. You know it's dirty.

53,Lauren D.,"Chicago, IL",165,372,,3.0,2014-06-27,"Dear Red Robin Manager,  I was recently at your Harlem Avenue location with my husband. We were craving a good, solid burger and decided to stop in here (instead of going to Lead Belly's or any other burger restaurant). In Chicago, we have tons of choices. The service here was incredibly slow. It was not super crowded and it was not super busy. We came way after lunch time. I am downgrading my rating from four stars to three stars. It had been a while since we ate here. I hope the service here improves or this restaurant will not be around much longer at this location. People who go to restaurants today want ""an experience"" and are seeking quality decent to above average service. Having three young college students at the front greeting customers with ""Hello, how are you tonight"" upon entering and ""Thank you for coming"" at the end of the evening as customers leave the restaurant does not cut it -- after all, this is not WalMart. My burger was very, very good and cooked with a little pink in the center -- the way I requested -- the reason I am downgrading your restaurant is because the service was very, very, very slow. In fact, I think a turtle can move faster than the server that we had. As soon as we got our food, which took a long time to be delivered to the table, we were happy to indulge since we had skipped lunch that day. The burgers were juicy, flavorful and tender.  I have no complaints about the burgers. They were worthy of four stars.  I like the steak fries which taste fresh, so consistency is not an issue. Quality Control is in place, so this is a good thing. I ordered the Banzai burger which was topped off with a crisp piece of lettuce, tomatoes, and grilled pineapple. I asked for ""no"" mayo, because the mayo makes the burger slide all over the place. Sometimes it can even pop out of the bun as you take a bite, so this time around I skipped the mayo all together. I hope the managers read this review, and improve upon service. Our Server was sweet and hospitable. However, it took over five minutes, from the time we were seated, to get a menu dropped off at our table. Why? I don't know. When our check was finally delivered we immediately asked our Server to please take our cash because we didn't want to have ""MIA"" for another 30-minutes or so. We paid. We ran out of there as fast as our little legs could manage to run!   I'm not sure that I will go here again any time soon -- in fact, I may never go back again. Yeah, it was that bad. Repeat customers (business) is what makes or breaks a restaurant.  Management, please re-train the staff at this location, because from reading these reviews I am not the only person who feels this way.

Either way, I'll start by saying this is not a destination restaurant. It's more like you're nearby and want a burger. That said, we were seated and our waitress came over quickly. I had a feeling she was new-ish because every time we asked a question, she had to go ask someone for an answer. Not a huge deal, but a little strange. Food came out quickly - the appetizer was out within a few minutes. For some reason, it always took a while for the fries to come out. I guess it's good because that means they make them fresh to order? Maybe? We were checked on often, our drinks were filled, extra napkins were brought, and we were given a fresh order of fries to go straight into our doggie bag. Tip: I joined their loyalty club years ago, and while I haven't frequented the restaurant in about a year, I got an email for a free birthday burger in the month of my birthday. That's why we were there - to cash it in. The tab before the free burger came out to $28 before tip. I'm not sure it would be worth it at that price point, but the free burger brought it down to about $10/person with tip. Look, if you want fantastic food, this isn't the place. If you want a burger a little more upscale from McDonald's with a place to sit, come here.

43,Mallory B.,"Chicago, IL",2,44,3.0,2.0,2014-11-20,"Came here for my brother's birthday. I think the main issue was our waiter. He was not very attentive at all... Honestly one of the worst waiters I've had in a while (and I'm not hard to please). To begin with, he had no personality and barely smiled more than once the entire evening and was barely responsive to questions we asked. At one point he didn't even answer a question someone in our party had.. He just nodded without even looking them in the eye.  Maybe he was having a bad day. But the service was truly bad.  My dad and I both asked for lemon in our water; we got none. (We did get a little cup of lemons when we re-asked). My sister asked for no mayo on her lettuce wrap; it came with mayo. The manager brought out a new one within a few minutes, thankfully. Our drinks were not refilled ONCE. We were not ONCE asked if we wanted or needed refills on drinks or fries (we did). My dad did finally flag down our waiter (which we had to do consistently to get his attention since he rarely stopped by) for a water refill and his request was granted. Did our waiter notice 5 other empty/nearly empty glasses on the table and offer us refills? No...  Also took him a really long time to take our check. The restaurant was hardly busy. All the food we had was decent (apart from the mayo mess up). When we were seated our table didn't have enough napkins set out for our party. The knives set out also looked dirty.

I haven't been because I'm not crazy for overpriced burgers,  but since it was my son's birthday I figured it would be worth it.  Our waiter was nice, it seemed he didn't have too much experience with kids, it was ok. NO BIGGIE. Here is why I give I was disappointed: 1. They didn't give us the usual plastic kids cups that the kids usually  get. ( not sure if it's thing of the past since I hadn't been here) They gave us this  regular cups with a lid, which my 2 year old kept spilling of.  2. My son got the mac and cheese which came in first. It was given to him on a glass oven pot, it was extremely hot, it was too watery which caused a bigger mess.  3. My daughter and I got the BOCA (Veggie burgers) I've made this at home and they don't take too much to cook, but this looked undercooked. I got 10 fries with mine, I had to ask for more right away.  I suddenly realize why I hadn't been there for a long time. Overpriced burgers! The fries were good though.  I really would have gotten better food elsewhere even a fast food restaurant.

Tasted the BBQ boneless wings which which were over cooked and rubbery. The Gourmet burger with bacon was excellent and hit a good price point at 10$ and the steak cut fries were ok kinda bland. The fries were unlimited but it seemed like they gave about 4 ounces of fries and then you would have to catch the waitress for more. The shakes were awesome and tasty. Soda is free refills but at 3 dollars a pop you will never drink that much soda! Mixed drink were balanced and tasted great. Nice place for family.

It was like they care about your order, then all they wanna do is flip your table. Which was ridiculous on a hardly busy, Friday night at 8pm. After our waitress (dyed red-head w glasses) took our order, she came around less and less.  She cared about if our food looked okay. I immediately rejected the garlic aioli sauce for dipping my fries in. ( bite-sized garlic pieces! Blech!) but once she gave me chipotle sauce to replace (also mediocre), she was never to be seen again. We hadn't even both bit into burgers at this point. Usually it'd be good for a 2-5 minute checkup after food dropoff.  The manager came by... 10 minutes after my drink was emptied, without a recheck from our server. Essentially, the only time she came back, since swappin out sauces, was to drop off our bill. In fact, she asked if we wanted our dessert, as we dropped our bill off. I felt that was a little presumptuous. More understandable if the restaurant was busy. I'm sure it would not have been a big deal to ring out another receipt, but didn't really show an interest in selling dessert.  (I later saw some boozy drinks I wanted to try, like a blue moon float or a bailey's shake... but considering the iffy service, I opted out). *shrug* after we paid our bill, there was no interest in us any longer.  No refills on fries, no refills on drinks, shabby service on a half-full house on Friday.

25,Jenny M.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",276,476,329.0,2.0,2016-10-26,"I stopped at this Red Robin on my way to the airport. The location was easy to get to and only 10 minutes away from O'Hare.  There was no wait and I was seated right away. The restaurant was freezing, and I had to wear my jacket the entire time.  Our staff was okay. She appeared every once and awhile, but was not present throughout the experience.  Before placing my order I asked for my side of bottomless fries to be brought out. They were delicious. As I waited for my entree- which took entirely too long- I ordered a second round of fries (they are bottomless after all). The second batch wasn't hot and tasted stale, not worth eating.  For my entree I ordered the new Black and Blue Burger, part of the ""Red Robin Finest"" line of food. The burger is pictured on a ciabatta bun topped with a pile of cheese. The picture was misleading. While the bun was delicious, there was hardly any blue cheese on the burger- there was a sprinkling of a few blue cheese crumbs- but that was it. The rest of the burger was good but had to be eaten with a knife and fork.   While I am a huge Red Robin fan, I don't think I would make my way back to this specific location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-norridge,3.72,3.72,3.72,,3.7200000000000006

29,Ella B.,"Chicago, IL",6,59,8.0,3.0,2017-03-08,"I like the food, but I don't like the prices. The prices are especially bad on certain items, such as the Clucks & Fries. You only get four tenders, and if you carry out, they make sure to give you a scanty amount of fries, even though they are bottomless when you eat inside. I don't understand why the garlic fries are always different when I order them for an upcharge. Sometimes you get a ton of garlic flavor and parmesan cheese, other times you get little garlic flavor and no cheese at all. If someone pays to upgrade, why would they want fries that are basically the same as the plain ones?  The tenders can also run very small, like the size of a large potato chip. A box full of small tenders does not put me in a good mood, since you only get four in the first place, I suppose I shouldn't say a box full. I am glad that they finally got online ordering. No more sitting forever at the counter waiting for food.  If you decide to get tenders, make sure to get some garlic aioli sauce and poppy-seed honey mustard, if you like those sort of flavors. Avoid the Roy Rogers soda at ALL costs, unless you like drinking medicine. The fried mushrooms...I had a double order of the most flavorless fried mushrooms I've ever eaten. You get 10 for $7. That's not a very good deal. They get soggy really quick. I had to put them in the oven after I got home less than two hours later. I put some garlic salt on them to add flavor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-norridge,3.6,3.6,3.6,,3.6000000000000005

20,Lillian S.,"Chicago, IL",4,11,27.0,4.0,2017-08-27,"Red Robin's is very affordable and has a nice ambiance. I went to Red Robin's to snack on some appetizers after shopping at Harlem Irving Plaza.  We ordered the towering onion rings which consisted of 13 delicious onion rings. It comes with two different sauces. I would order this again, if I ever went back to Red Robin's in the future. We also ordered the Guac, Sala and Chips. This wasn't my favorite. The chips were great; however, the salsa and the guac just didn't do. It was very salty and guac wasn't fresh.  Apart from these, we ordered a chicken tortilla soup. It was decent, but I don't think I'd order this again. The crispy  tortilla was a nice addition the soup.  Apart from the food itself, the staff were kind and courteous. The place is clean and is definitely a great spot to stop by after shopping at the mall. Paying my bill was so easy and fast with the table top kiosk.  Overall, it was a good experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-norridge,3.52,3.52,3.52,,3.5200000000000005

When our food came, it was cold. We asked for refill on fries & drinks and got the drinks 20 minutes later. A family that was seated after us was given their drinks 30-40 minutes after they arrived & never had the chance to even eat. We were later informed that a cook walked off the job & manager was in the kitchen cooking (under staffed). We never received the refill of fries & another customer also walked out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-norridge,3.48,3.48,3.48,,3.4800000000000004

27,Geanine H.,"Harwood Heights, IL",58,5,,5.0,2017-11-15,I wanted to share an awesome experience we had tonight at Red Robin. We go there frequently as it's my son's favorite. Today is his birthday and he chose to go there for dinner. Service was a little slow and our food arrived cold. We mentioned it to our waitress but didn't want to send the food back because we were starving. The manager came over and went out of his way to make the situation right. He was so nice that even my 9 year old commented on it when he walked away. He even went out of his way to find my son a treat that was peanut free because of his allergy. We so appreciated his outstanding customer service and made what could of been a disappointing dinner a great one. Thank you so much.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-norridge,3.56,3.56,3.56,,3.5600000000000005
21,Maryam E.,"Chicago, IL",167,48,32.0,3.0,2017-11-16,"So we went there on a Sunday afternoon. The front section of the restaurant was empty but the back was very crowded. Also this is by the HIP mall and an Xsport fitness, so they all share parking, so it was very difficult to park.  The menu is a bit confusing since they separate gourmet burgers from regular burgers from their tavern menu - basically 4 sections of burgers. Too many options, which is good that's not a bad thing - unless you are like me you get overwhelmed - but it's good. They do have all the combination of toppings on a burger you could think off - bacon eggs mushrooms pineapple chili fried onion guacamole - seriously a lot.  I think they are known for their gigantic onion ring tower - which we didn't order. We ordered the creamy spinach and artichoke dip - that was creamy and yummy, however the chips were not enough for the dip, we asked for a little more. We also got the bruschetta chicken sandwich - that was also good, and then my friend's son got a well-don burger (ok I agree, no one should ever get a well done burger) but it wasn't well done, it was burned. Well done should just contain no red at all, not look like it might be a burger -  but too burned to tell.  I got the salmon and the brocoli dish - to my surprise, not dry, not over-salty, and no butter. The strawberry lemonade thing is really good too, and is bottomless.  Overall ok.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-norridge,3.48,3.48,3.48,,3.4800000000000004
