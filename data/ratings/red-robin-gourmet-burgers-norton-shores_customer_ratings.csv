23,Rob C.,"Mercer Island, WA",7,10,,4.0,2012-06-06,"This chain really has their act together for standardizing. I have been to several in several cities and enjoy the predictable, overall quality experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-norton-shores?start=20,,,,,
16,Teri C.,"Las Vegas, NV",0,163,36.0,4.0,2012-09-24,"Went for lunch on Sunday........staff was nice. They weren't too busy, so I did see lots of cleaning going on which I liked.  1st table they sat us at, the bench was very well worn which put me at chin level with the table.  I asked to move, no problems.  Our waiter seemed a bit nervous, but very friendly.  He did make a mistake and forget to put our order in....but quickly took care of it.  The food was tasty.....not WOW, but good.  Prices are average and this Red Robbin is way better than the one in Lansing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-norton-shores,,,,,
20,Marie S.,"North Muskegon, MI",0,40,8.0,2.0,2012-11-29,"Service OK most of the time.  Have to ask a couple times if needing something extra - special sauces etc.  And, they claim to have a dedicated fryer for gluten free fries yet have been told to call ahead or always ask server as you ""never know"" what the previous shift might have done??  Also, told me they have gluten free burger buns so asked how they toast them and was told they are processed on the same line as the regular buns.  Cross contamination!  I was then offered to have the GF burger bun placed on the top rack (??) and asked what else is processed on that location.  I was told by the manager ..... just our pizza's!  That bun is no longer GF!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-norton-shores?start=20,,,,,
22,Anthony H.,"Muskegon, MI",0,4,,4.0,2013-01-05,"First time at the muskegon location.  Only second time ever visiting this chain.  The main reason is the price.  For two adults and a child it was over $35 for burgers.  Granted the burgers were very good just a little pricey in my opinion.  The service we received was great.  It's not a place I would become a regular at, but the experience was a good one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-norton-shores?start=20,,,,,
18,Jason L.,"Ferrysburg, MI",0,23,5.0,4.0,2013-02-02,"It's a chain, but decent. The food is average chain burgers and chicken, but the staff at this location is very friendly each time I have been here. So friendly in fact that I have tipped over 75% a couple times just due to the amazing service.  My fiancé had bad service here once with her family, so I am sure not all the staff is perfect, but it is definitely well above average in terms of staff members who are pleasant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-norton-shores,,,,,
17,Desiree R.,"Muskegon, MI",1,32,20.0,5.0,2014-04-22,The service is always very good and everyone is very happy. My children love to come here and get the freckled lemonade.  The burgers are amazing. I have tried a few different ones but the ultimate cheese burger is amazing and my favorite. And the bottomless steak fries... well how can you go wrong with that,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-norton-shores,,,,,
21,Mike W.,"Spring Lake, MI",0,3,,2.0,2014-05-16,"Service used to be alright, not so much now. Last time I visited, I waited almost an hour for my food after ordering. The server told me that he was ""looking into it"" three times before I just walked.   The restaurant want exactly busy. I ordered a Prime Rib Dip and a beer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-norton-shores?start=20,,,,,
14,Salvi R.,"Washington, DC",2,57,21.0,4.0,2014-12-30,"I was at Red Robin's last week with my mother and cute little niece. We had a great time with great food. Our waiter was wonderful, too. His  name was Dave P., if you ever make it to Red Robins, then ask for Dave P. He has excellent customer service. I will definitely be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-norton-shores,,,,,
15,Susan W.,"Muskegon, MI",0,33,3.0,5.0,2015-05-16,"I love this place.  We are always happy with the food and the service. It's not cheap, that is for sure it I am willing to pay for food that I love.     The bartenders there rock too, btw!  If they are busy just sit at the bar. We love their seasoning they have in the tables and they sell it to bring home.  Totally worth it to have a home and make all fries taste like theirs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-norton-shores,,,,,
13,Logen A.,"Twin Lake, MI",13,4,,1.0,2015-10-30,They forgot my order....milkshakes were good Endless fries weren't endless Didn't get my salad To go box broke  Waiting line was slow,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-norton-shores,,,,,
10,Eric R.,"Norton Shores, MI",4,48,,3.0,2015-12-15,"Service was very good, food was OK.  There is no place to hang your coat, and the booths are so small that with 4 people you end up with your coat in your lap.  I ended up taking mine back to the car, fortunately it wasn't too cold.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-norton-shores,,,,,
12,Kevin M.,"Brunswick, GA",0,10,9.0,5.0,2016-01-08,Food is excellent & the service wonderful!  I wish we had more of these down south!  The management here took care of our every need...which is really saying something with 3 kids in tow!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-norton-shores,,,,,
11,Teresa K.,"Fremont, MI",4,4,,4.0,2016-01-10,"Took my son and his girlfriend here for his birthday. All of the food arrived In a reasonable amount of time except the girlfriend's chicken sandwich. Her sandwich showed up about 10 minutes after the other meals. The manager brought the plate, apologized and took the item off our tab. We didn't have to say a word. Great recovery!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-norton-shores,,,,,
5,Betsy D.,"Commerce, MI",6,54,50.0,5.0,2016-07-08,"Delicious Wedgie Burger (iceberg lettuce wrapped burger with all veggie toppings), lightly battered broccoli with 2 delish dips and onion rings stacked.

3,Will R.,"Muskegon, MI",0,46,55.0,1.0,2016-10-01,"Checked in an hour ago. Just got my food, lukewarm and undercooked. Ordered medium well, it's closer to medium, it's still pretty pink in the center. I would put money on this not temping at 160F. The restaurant was busy, but cleared out a while ago. We are fairly certain our food has been sitting under the warming lights for at least 10 minutes.  We've been here for almost an hour and a half and are just starting to eat.  I'd love to talk about how great our waitress was, and how good the food is when we come. I can't. the wait time and quality this visit are terrible and inexcusable.  Avoid them at busy times, they can't handle it. Aim for lunch if you must.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-norton-shores,,,,,
9,Kenyon S.,"Grand Haven, MI",0,3,,1.0,2016-10-02,"My family and i went to red Robin for dinner, it was six of us and i was told it will be a ten minute wait.

4,Jarrell C.,"Spring Lake, MI",22,18,,1.0,2016-10-25,"So, we decided to try red robin.  I had been once before when I lived out east but thought I would give the ""gourmet burger"" chain here a try.  Our Experience started with a 20 minute wait for a beer only to find out that no one knew how to tap the new draft barrel and the bottle offerings were limited. Our waitress seemed very nice, but inexperienced and I think she did her best.  Onto the food:  I was a little surprised to see that they had a gourmet burger offering, so I decided to try the black and blue burger priced at $15.  I was a little apprehensive ordering a $15 burger at a chain restaurant, but the photo was appealing... probably the worst burger I've eaten.  Stick with basics if you have to eat here.

2,Hannah B.,"Nunica, MI",43,59,13.0,2.0,2017-03-09,"Eating at Red Robin is average.  They have good burgers, but are definitely over priced. The endless fries are good when they are actually hot and not cold and the staff is hit and miss on friendliness.  It's good when you want a burger, but other than that I usually go elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-norton-shores,,,,,
6,Richard H.,"Columbus, MS",0,192,,4.0,2017-06-08,We have seen these places advertised for years but until today had never ate at one. Both of us ordered the signature cheeseburger and it was very good. Nothing extraordinary but still a good hamburger. The endless fries were good and our server came back to our table when they were running low and asked if we needed more of them. The wait staff was quite friendly and made our visit enjoyable. Drinks were kept filled without waiting and I like that! Another bonus was the cleanliness of the dining area as well as the bathroom.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-norton-shores,,,,,
