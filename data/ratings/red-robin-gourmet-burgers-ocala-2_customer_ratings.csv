13,Emilee H.,"Cape Coral, FL",172,2,,1.0,2017-08-01,"Went today and had a bad experience, our server had us order apps and our kids meal thru the little computer on the table because she was too lazy I guess. We never got ANY drink refill, our glasses sat empty in clear view of managers and other servers! We asked for a refill and ketchup because the one on the table was out, we NEVER got ketchup even though we asked two different servers twice! How can you serve burgers and have no ketchup?! I have never had such horrible service and I will never be back! I expected so much more for their grand opening! Maybe I just got a bad server but considering the managers and other servers saw our empty glasses I don't think that's the case!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ocala-2,,,,,
10,Elliot S.,"Ocala, FL",5,1,1.0,1.0,2017-08-03,"First off, know that I had to download Yelp JUST to leave this review. My wife and 2 year old went there and was pleased with the way the restaurant appeared. The servers were friendly, but that's where my good things about this place end. The burger made me ill upon arriving home, the ""chicken-stickens"" on the kids menu were so over cooked it wasn't even palatable. The fruit that we ordered was given to us in a dressing cup, and the strawberries were PINK bc they were so over ripe. When I talked to a manager, the said the cup sizes were small, but bottomless, and the berries were that way bc they came in a liquid. WHAT?! Also, I can't tell you about the guacamole we ordered as an app, bc we never got it. Avoid and save yourself money and heartache. Not worth it!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ocala-2,,,,,
17,Megan L.,"Ocala, FL",0,4,,1.0,2017-08-03,I had brought  my husband and our daughter in for dinner and thought the brand new Red Robin is something new and exciting. the experience was horrible in all honesty. My poor daughters food look awful and she couldn't even eat her dinner and had to leave form red robin and get her Chick-fil-a . We sat without utensils for a while until we could wave someone down.  I wouldn't waste my money at a Red Robin again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ocala-2,,,,,
11,Mattias Z.,"Ocala, FL",1,42,,2.0,2017-08-07,"Staff has no clue, manager needs attitude adjustment and this is before my food has arrived.  Writing now once my food has arrived, not cooked to request.  Took me to get to a manager for them to understand what medium well means and it still came out rare, not even medium rare.  Dining area is stuffy and noisy and seems more like a diner.  Food sent back twice, before I walked out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ocala-2,,,,,
15,Jay S.,"Ocala, FL",0,6,2.0,3.0,2017-08-09,"The food was good. The beer we ordered flat yet it was replaced without any issues. The service wasn't very good; may have been it was their second week of being opened so we can understand that. The saturation of servers probably made the service worse than it should have been. Ask for another order of fries from the runner who delivered your food and you may as well forget that order. Poof! There was quite a good wait and tables that needed to be bused while staff stood around as if to say ""not my job."" Let's just say customer service was weak which means management and leadership has no clue.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ocala-2,,,,,
16,Angela C.,"Ocala, FL",8,17,,5.0,2017-08-20,We have been here two times and both experiences have been excellent. The burgers are absolutely some of the best my husband and I have ever had.  Endless fries are great. This location in Ocala is new so the line can sometimes spill out the door. On our visits we sat at the bar so we got seats right away.  The staff was friendly and helpful. Our food (even with the long lines) always came out quickly and perfectly!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ocala-2,,,,,
12,Lori V.,"Atlanta, GA",100,23,12.0,4.0,2017-09-02,Service was great but not overly impressed with the food. The burger was quite small and didn't look like the menu at all so not worth the $15 price tag.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ocala-2,,,,,
20,Jeremy G.,"Ocala, FL",6,5,,1.0,2017-09-03,"Thought the wife and I would check this Red Robin out since I had been to one previously while living in Colorado. Granted, this place has only been open for a month, so having a small crowd is to be expected. However, the clear indication that I probably should have turned away was the fact that the restaurant was a complete mess. Food all over the floors and menus were just as sticky as everything else at our table. As if the only cleaning person working there quit a week ago and no one else has been bothered to do anything. The food came out to us in a short amount of time and tasted fine, but was extremely greasy. Once we left, the wife and I immediately felt sick and had now been sick the entire night into the morning. They really need to get their stuff together. The reason I feel it's even 1 star is because our waitress was friendly and on point......plus I can't give a no star review. BY the way, don't touch the interactive tablet on the table once unless to pay, otherwise, they just stole another $1.99 from you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ocala-2?start=20,,,,,
2,Scott K.,"Ocala, FL",0,15,,2.0,2017-09-06,"We Have eaten at several other RR's and always had a GREAT experience. Maybe our experience at this location is due to it just being opened.....regardless, our experience at this location was an epic fail! In spite of the numerous employees standing around doing nothing, our service was horrible- food took forever and was unable to get drink refills until going to the bar. Food was undercooked as ordered and appeared soggy and possibly microwaved. Don't bother ordering endless fries as you will never see your server again. Maybe our experience would have been better if we spent time at the ENORMOUS and vastly inappropriate bar getting hammered first. Have not seen this bar feature to this extent in other RR's.......maybe the bar is a hedge on the restaurant gamble......keep putting out food like we experienced with crappy, non existent service and another bar is all you will be.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ocala-2,,,,,
1,David J.,"Morriston, FL",33,32,47.0,5.0,2017-09-16,"We were out getting groceries and decided to have a meal before getting groceries. The Red Robin had recently opened, so we figured we would give it a try.  Our server, Ryan, was THE BOMB! He did a great job with our entire experience, keeping it light and funny, engaging the girls without being patronizing and we never once lacked for fries.  The Black and Bleu burger was awesome, the Banzai burger was great, and both kids' meals were inhaled.  Great place, always loved it when we were in Texas and happy there is now one here in Ocala.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ocala-2,,,,,
8,Sara R.,"Baltimore, MD",24,68,84.0,5.0,2017-09-17,"I haven't been to one of these for a couple years now, and boy I sure missed it. It was pretty packed but we got seated fast. Our waiter was super knowledgeable, honest (which I love) and friendly. I got the southern charm with an egg and my husband got something with jalapeño relish on it lol can't remember. They were cooked to perfection. Better than Guy Fieri's hands down. The only down fall would be the poutine fries (which our waiter warned us about) they were not very cheesy and they didn't have enough gravy on them. Other then the fries everything was great!!! They were clean and different from any other Red Robin I've ever been to. We will be going back, probably next week lol",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ocala-2,,,,,
19,Don F.,"Ocala, FL",0,8,,4.0,2017-10-03,"Been to Red Robin, at other locations, many times.  Held off going to this new location because of the bad reviews.  A little slow to take my order, but otherwise, a very good meal.  Will certainly go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ocala-2,,,,,
14,Jesse D.,"Lady Lake, FL",0,5,,4.0,2017-10-07,"It's a standard Red Robin, which is great because it's one of my favorite chain restaurants! The service is great here. I've been multiple times and have had great service every time. It's brand new, so the atmosphere is really nice and has a cool aesthetic. The food is what you would expect from any Red Robin: fresh and delicious.  If you haven't been to Red Robin before, it's one of my favorite burger places. The food will run you $9+ per meal and they have a large selection of burgers. I've had several different ones on the menu over the years and I haven't had one I disliked. My current favorite is the A1 Peppercorn Burger W/ blue cheese crumbles added on. Also, they have sauces you can request with your fries for free that are delicious. The Campfire BBQ sauce is my favorite.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ocala-2,,,,,
4,Dave W.,"Safety Harbor, FL",355,1095,2647.0,2.0,2017-10-22,"I'm just not a fan of a burger place that only offers their burgers in medium well or well done. We can't even order medium, for gosh sake. I guess it's for our safety but I like to live dangerously.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ocala-2,,,,,
18,Sydney C.,"St. Charles, IL",3,29,3.0,2.0,2017-10-26,"Came here for my birthday. We were told to sign up for the rewards program because they said we can come back during the birthday month to get a feee burger. We signed up while we were there still. We come back (same month) I put in the rewards and the free burger wasn't working. Our waitress tried to figure it out and I guess eventually went to the manager. About waiting after 5 minutes we were told a manager would be right over to speak with us. Waited another 10 minutes and the manager shows up and tells us that we cannot get the free Birthday burger due to the fact that apparently an email had been sent, but I had never received it and so he then says ""oh.. must of gone to junk mail"" then offered to give us the number so we can call the rewards. Was not willing to give the free Birthday burger. Couldn't deliver what has been advertised and what we were told. It even tells you on that little tablet at the table that you get a free burger for your birthday. Anyway, as dumb and petty as all this sounds, it's still the fact of the matter that the manager who seemed to care less to be quite honest, could only give us a number to call to figure it out our selves. When we said you know what whatever we'll just pay for it he didn't really seem to care that we were displeased that all he seemed to want to do was hand us a number to call he just said ""mmmk"" and walked away... I'm pretty shocked with this to be quite honest because usually at Red Robin we get like amazing service. Tonight though at this location , not so much. Most likely won't be back. Because the waitress and manager showed the perfect example of what it looks like when an employee can careless.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ocala-2,,,,,
0,Janis H.,"Ocala, FL",1,86,369.0,5.0,2017-11-22,"We had lunch at Red Robin today...the building is ascetically appealing outside and in with attractive décor and pleasant eating areas.  I ordered an old fashion drink which was a bit of a fiasco because they couldn't find the jar of bitters at first but then they found it and my drink was perfect Tom ordered a Banzai Burger with bottomless fries and I ordered Honey Dijon Chicken Boneless Wings which were delish! An added bonus...the breading was minimal...a good thing.  Both meals were done correctly and very tasty.  Our server, Crystal was friendly, efficient, informative and wore cute, funky tights because per Crystal ""It's wacky Wednesday""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ocala-2,,,,,
5,Ruth F.,"Ocala, FL",4,18,63.0,2.0,2017-11-28,"Went to Red Robin for the first time. Place is not crowded and we got seated right away. Server is polite and explains us the reward card. We orders two hamburgers with fries and ice tea. We thought that it was gonna be gourmet as they advertised but it was not. If you want  Angus beef, there's a $3.50 up charge and anything else is ala carte and for a 5 pieces tiny slices Jalapeño is also an up charge for $0.99 and one glass of ice tea is $3 each. All in all we bought 2 hamburgers 2 fries and two ice tea for $35 and change plus tip. It's more about Gourmet pricing than hamburger. Outback hamburger is a lot less!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ocala-2,,,,,
7,Don C.,"Ocala, FL",25,45,33.0,4.0,2017-11-29,"Our first visit to this location and the service was outstanding.  The food was excellent and we would return.

9,Sam O.,"Acworth, GA",3,5,,1.0,2017-12-22,TERRIBLE SERVICE! Extremely rude and prejudice. Greeted everybod expect us. If youre a family of color stay away. It seems they dont like to serve of different origins. Waited thirty minutes for someone to come to table. No apology nothing . Full of dumb blondes. Manager could only offer a 50% discount . First and last time coming here. MCDONALDS has better service. Never again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ocala-2,,,,,
6,Elizabeth F.,"Ocala, FL",61,13,2.0,3.0,2017-12-27,The service was terrible and the bad part was it was not that busy. We had six people in our party. Ordered burgers and drinks. The waitress definitely needs to find another line of work. We had to go to the Manager twice regarding items missing which was a true disappointment. Hoping the Manager would investigate a little but he really didn't care. Someone in our party ordered the endless root beer float. After she was almost done with her meal the waitress finally brought the root beer but no ice cream. We had to have Manager bring it which was a joke because our friend had to try and put ice cream in a full glass of root beer. Who does that????The reason I rated this three stars is because at least the food was good but the the service and Manager stunk. We have never had a bad experience in Gainesville - Ocala needs help including a Manager that cares. My visit was on 12/26/17,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ocala-2,,,,,
3,Mark T.,"Corpus Christi, TX",7,6,,1.0,2018-01-08,"Food was good, but overpriced. Especially when you pay for bottomless fries, but the server never brings them to you (even when you flag them down and ask for them). Waited ten minutes for the ""refill"" of fries and end up just leaving. Service was awful, we won't be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ocala-2,,,,,
