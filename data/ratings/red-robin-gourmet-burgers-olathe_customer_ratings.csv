26,Billie H.,"Kansas City, MO",320,745,815.0,2.0,2012-07-01,"I haven't been here for a couple of years so was looking forward to lunch. I remembered the burgers and fries being fantastic. Sadly, the quality has changed. They serve steak fries. I prefer a larger cut fry, crispy outside and soft inside. Their fries and just soft all over. I wouldn't say they are not cooked, but cooking another 20-30 seconds would help tremendously. The burgers are bland and lack seasoning. I got a burger with blue cheese, wing sauce and celery straws. The wing sauce had no heat, there was very little blue cheese (you could barely taste it) and the celery straws were not crunchy. The macaroni and cheese was disgusting. The noodles were terribly overcooked and the cheese sauce was describable. I was really shocked by how the quality of food has declined here. The service was spectacular. The waitress took good care of us. Making sure we had plenty of the endless fries, refills and offering to go drinks. Although the service is really good, the food is not worth a visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-olathe?start=20,2.568,2.568,2.568,2.568,2.5680000000000005

I searched their web site for something that I could carry out  that was gluten free.  I decided on an ""Avo Cabo Salad""; minus the blue cheese chunks of course.  I called to place my order for carry out at 7:40 local time (on Sunday evening), and was told it would be ready in 15 minutes.  When I arrived @ 8:11, (31 minutes later), they told me my SALAD would be ready shortly.  Really?  It's a salad.  It's not ready?  And as I look around the restaurant, I notice that it's not quite a morgue, but maybe it's on it's way....   Okay, so I wait for it to be brought out, and I suppose the manager thought that they may have fallen short of the goal because she brought it out herself.  When I leave with my order, i discover that they have packaged a piece of warm foccacia (sp?) bread with my cold salad in the SAME bag!  I know... why do I care about the bread because I can't eat wheat?  I just don't get why you'd package anything warm with anything cold.  And furthermore, I get NO fork with which to eat my salad!  Really?  Are you kidding me? Okay, I am NEVER one to do a survey or leave my opinion...so why am I doing so here you ask?  It's because when my chain gets rattled so much, I just want to see justice be served!  I won't even go in to the trouble that I had when I TRIED to leave my constructive criticism on their website!

18,Kimberly B.,"Overland Park, KS",64,44,79.0,3.0,2013-09-03,"Went on a midweek date with my husband to this location.  This was my first visit to a RR, and the food was good.  I started out with the mini wedge salad and it was tasty with bleu cheese and fried onion strings, and a good price at 3 bucks.  For the main event, I ordered the Royal Red (?) burger and it was to die for.  Lovely and well seasoned patty topped with lettuce and tomato, cheese, bacon, and a perfectly cooked sunny side up egg.  The ""bottomless"" fries were good from the few I ate... I was stuffed after the burger!  For the food alone, I would go to a RR again without a doubt.  HOWEVER.  :)  We came after the dinner rush and either there was no manager or just a really lax one on duty.  There were unoccupied employees sitting around for literally the entire time we were there.  At one point there was a table of five workers laughing loudly, a girl in uniform who appeared to be on a date and a table of two employees having a deep conversation a few tables down.  They were disruptive to the few actual patrons that were there, and I felt bad for the employees that were actually working.  Someone should have sent the extras all home probably well before we got there.  They were annoying and made the place feel inefficient. Our waitress was endlessly polite and bubbly but a bit flaky, and I think she was probably getting some social time in as well.  The simple starter salad I ordered was most likely forgotten by her until our burgers were ready because it came out literally a minute before the burgers, so even though my burger tasted awesome, it was cooler than I'd like by the time I got to it.  We had to ask for things twice and we wouldn't see her for long stretches at a time. Overall the food made it worth the visit but I'd like to go again to see if its normally that unorganized or if we just caught it on a weird night.  If its like that again,I'll probably stick with other locations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-olathe,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003

8,Elizabeth N.,"Lawrence, KS",22,307,,1.0,2016-10-22,"Since my previous review in 2011, I have frequented this location and it's become too inconsistent to ever return. The service is incredibly spotty, with service in the bar being the absolute worst. I go here specifically because I want to binge eat excessive orders of french fries, so I get upset when sometimes the server keeps em coming and sometimes they have excuses like the fries aren't ready yet. My last visit was the final straw for me. I ordered my burger medium well and it came out medium rare. I told my server, and he said they would make me a new one, but that it would ""be a while."" No apology, no rushing the order, just a bunch of inconsiderate lackadaisical employees. After 15 minutes and everyone finishing their meals, I received another medium rare burger and still no one cared. I asked to speak to the manager and while I was explaining that the burger was cooked improperly twice and everyone else was finished eating, she just kept cutting me off saying ""right, right"" and nothing else. It was really weird. Some of the servers like Bekka & Kelsey are good, but evidently no one else cares about custies.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-olathe,3.24,3.24,3.24,,3.2400000000000007

And let me tell you-we we're pleasantly surprised by our visit!  Our waitress Carrie was the best in town at any restaurant. She was SO good. Sweet, on the ball, helpful. We were both happy with the A1 burger cooked medium and Banazi burger with Boca substitute. Fries were always hot and plentiful. My only complaint was the amount of crumbs on the floor was a little much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-olathe,3.32,3.32,3.32,,3.3200000000000003

5,Sarah W.,"Olathe, KS",0,10,,4.0,2017-03-18,"When you're looking for a burger, they will satisfy your needs. The menu is not particularly creative, but does have a variety of options. They bring you bottomless basket of fries upon ordering if you ask. I choose to dip mine in their amazing house ranch (I could drink the stuff) and my husband likes their campfire sauce.  I typically order my burger 'lettuce-wrapped', and they always give plenty of iceberg so it really functions as a bun. Cocktails are great but their signature drinks are overpriced like many of their competitors. Great family place, but it is a bit noisy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-olathe,3.4,3.4,3.4,,3.4000000000000004

Onions straws and fries were soaked in grease unbelievable. You have a bunch of young kids working this place with no one managing any if them, oh but wait they do like to sing happy birthday and then scatter not to be seen again!

First our server got my  order wrong, then we had to ask twice for sugar for our iced tea, and when we asked for some more supposedly ""bottomless fries,"", they never arrived. Waited about 15 minutes and find decided to leave and then it took forever to get our server back over there so we could even leave!
