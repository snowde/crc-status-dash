84,Jamila A.,"Olympia, WA",17,37,2.0,3.0,2012-05-21,"They get 3 stars because the food was good.  One of our burgers didn't have enough Bleu Cheese and the manager came out and handled it right away.  He said, ""that is not smiling at you, let me fix it.""  However, the waitress was very flat and rushed us to give her our main course order.   When it is a celebration, and a small child, you should not feel rushed when it is a Sunday evening and things are pretty much dying down.  She asked me who was going to pay for my 1 year old's .99 cent drink.  I have never been asked that, but ok.  She didn't even tell us her name.  I would have rather had the nice guy down a couple tables, who would've made us laugh a little and not frown the whole time.   I THINK I will return but to another waitress.  She is lucky she got a tip.  My sister and I came in for our birthdays and unlike other waiters and waitressess, did not sing the traditional song or give us our sundaes.  Even if I come in a couple days after my birthday, without asking they always come singing to our table.   Btw, acknowledge your table first and then it would've been semi ok for you taking 15 minutes to come rush our order.  We would like actual ice water next time not, water that looked like it had been sitting out in the sun.  Wait?  There probably won't be a next time.  Bye bye, Red Robin Royal Burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-olympia?start=80,2.0920000000000005,2.0920000000000005,2.0920000000000005,2.0920000000000005,2.0920000000000005

Usually I am amazed at how fast the food comes out, but this time I was disappointed, about a half hour. Food was Luke warm when it arrived, including the eight soggy steak frys that came with my burger. Things I have noticed about Red Robin over the years.... the ranch that they used to bring with frys was thick and delicious, now it is watered down. The amount of frys with the burger and that they bring with refills has significantly been reduced.

Our waiter was really nice and everyone working here was very attentive with the refills, which is amazing in itself. The food was as expected at a chain restaurant...consistent. The banzai burger sans bun was delicious as expected and the Bruschetta Chicken sandwich was also delicious as well. The best part is the basket of bottomless fries! Of course everything is so big and filling, you cant actually eat a ton of them, but if you have the munchies or you've been starving for the last week, this is awesome.

But since they are a burger place, they better be able to do it right. For the most part their fries are really good too, plus, they are bottomless.  The biggest complaint i have is the service. (some of the time) I've gotten great service if they aren't busy. But if they are busy, be prepared to be ignored. They give the servers too many tables and don't have enough servers on to properly take care of the amount of people coming in the door.

115,Scott K.,"Portland, OR",9,1,,1.0,2012-09-02,"We visited this location on 8-29-12 on our way back from Seattle, we were seated right away but it took 17 min for our waitress to take our order. We ordered 3 prim rib dips, one without horseradish and regular fries, and 2 with garlic fries and a grilled turkey burger with regular fries. 2 cokes, 1milk, and a coffee we asked for all the drinks to come together, all the drinks came except the milk. Our waitress said it would be right out after that we did not see our waitress until we were done eating. we wanted refills but no waitress. The milk came out with the food 25 min later. When the food finally came out the prime rib we asked for no horseradish had horse radish and garlic fries, every thing else was ok. The manager came over and apologized for the mistake and we asked for refills, he said he would send someone over, but no one showed up. He brought us a new prime rib in 4 min(why did it take so long before, they were not that busy) when he brought it back it still had garlic fries, he said he would take it off the bill and get us one with out garlic fries, we kept it and ate so we could get out of there. Our waitress finally showed up (still no refills) and gave us our check, we paid cash, 2 dollars over the amount. She came back and we complained about the service and she got mad at us, grabbed the money and stormed off and disappeared, so she only got a 2 dollar tip.

102,Devon N.,"Olympia, WA",27,26,,1.0,2012-10-01,"I will never go back to this location again - the staff stole my sunglasses after I left them on the table! Over the years I've been to Red Robin a fair amount - in multiple locations.  Overall, they're not too bad.  This location was always good until my most recent visit.  I and two friends went in around 8 pm on a recent Wednesday evening.  We sat in the bar because it wasn't very crowded.  We ordered, ate, had relatively decent service - really, no complaints.  However, I accidentally left my sunglasses on the table when I left.  Had they been cheap sunglasses I wouldn't have cared but these were Coach aviators which cost a material amount.  I called the next morning when I realized I didn't have them.  I'm not one to misplace my things and I searched my car and house from top to bottom - there really is no other explanation.  Also, I distinctly remember taking them off my head and placing them on my table.  I spoke with multiple people over the next few days to no avail.  On at least two occasions they said they would get back to me and did not so I kept calling.   I will say, the Assistant Manager (I think his name was Jerry) was very understanding and eager to help.  It's unfortunate I cannot say the same for the General Manager (GM) or anyother staff I spoke with.  I was told I would get a call from the GM the next time he was at the restuarant but they never called.  At that point, I had been calling for about a week trying to get some resolution but eventually gave up, convinced that an employee simply walked off with my sunglasses. This whole situation has been really disappointing.  Decent and quick service means nothing if the staff at this particular location have no integrity or respect for the customers they are supposed to serve.  The only way I will go back to this location is if I velco all my belongings to my body to prevent the sticky-fingered staff from making off with my stuff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-olympia?start=100,2.92,2.92,2.92,1.8280000000000003,2.92
62,Olystacy B.,"Olympia, WA",90,725,369.0,2.0,2012-11-30,"i dont typically review chains and franchises but I feel like I need to mention this Red Robin.  This used to be our families go to spot but I really feel that the place is declining, to the point that we will most likely not go back. We arrived around 6:00 on a Wednesday night.  We were sat at a booth and no one acknowledged us for over 10 minutes. I waved someone down to ask if we could get some drinks and was told our server would be with us.  About 5 minutes later a very sweet but inefficient server came over and said she would be with us in a few.  Fast forward 5 minues (20 min of sitting at a table with nothing in front of us).  She took our order and lets just say things went down hill from there.   Drinks took a long time to get there, we ordered an appetizer that came out 20 minutes later and 2 minutes before our main entrees. This always pisses me off. WHY call it an appetizer if you are serving it at the same time as an entree? They forgot my sons food, and after we asked about it, it took another 10 minutes and our food was luke warm waiting for our sons to arrive before we began eating. She forgot salad dressings, and charged me 79 cents  for sour cream for dipping fries into. What the  heck is that all about? They used to bring out a sour cream ranch mix that was free! We didnt have any napkins or silverware for a good 5 minutes into having our food.  No refills on any of our drinks, even though we asked. When I asked to speak to the manager he said they were swamped and that was why service was spotty. He acted as if this should be expected and was grumpy about it too. DID NOT OFFER AN APOLOGY.  He did comp my sons corndog (gee thanks - whatever). Until I hear major improvements have occurred here, I am staying away.  I am  not willing to spend hard earned discretionary money on horrible service even if we do love your steak fries!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-olympia?start=60,2.96,2.96,2.96,1.9280000000000002,2.96

Food was tasty but lukewarm. Our server never checked on us and I had to walk to the drink station to refill my own dr pepper. I NEVER complain but asked to speak to the assistant manager, who explained that our server is new and comped us the appetizer and sodas, which was appreciated.

I have been in this particular location multiple times and always leave asking myself why i put myself through that! The food is below that of every other Red Robin i have been to and the service is just as poor.  This last trip was so bad that the manager ended up comping our entire meal (family of 4) The waiter completely forgot to put our order in and instead of coming by to make it right and apologize, he blatantly ignored us while we waited and watched everyone around us come and go.

I had a Royal Red Robin burger on ciabatta bread w/ sweet potato fries last time I was there (yesterday). The burger wasn't great, it was really goopy with all the flavorless mayo and the VERY runny egg yolk. The sweet potato fries are good, but they upcharge $1.49 to get them instead of their regular fries, which is crazy for the small amount of fries you get. Burger, sweet potato upcharge, and a Diet Coke cost me $20 after an 18% tip.

They have had awesome servers, food, service and so on. That is until lately. The last time i tried to order to go, the service was horrible, rude, was getting my order wrong, and then hung up. I called back and the service was little better. I've only gone once since. This past Thursday, yesterday, I decided to order out again. My daughter works at the mall so I decided to order two Cobb salads. They were the WORST salads I've ever had. The avocado was Brown, tomatoes were pureed, the lettuce was Brown and 2 of the 4 ranches were chunky and tasted like spoiled mayo..

76,Cassandra L.,"Puyallup, WA",5,36,5.0,1.0,2014-07-09,"First our server did not know the fry sauces they offered, which is ok I understand but now I expect you to go find out for me and then come back to let me know. I literally had to google it, at the Puyallup location they have the fry sauce list inside their menu why this Red Robin does not I have no idea!  Secondly when our food arrived I saw the manager bringing it out and then our server took it from him to serve us, this is when I noticed that the top fries on my plate were smashed like something was on top of them and then I found 2 mushrooms stuck to the other side of them. My burger had no mushrooms on them.  Thirdly about 5 minutes into getting our food she drops off the check for us. I really dislike receiving the check in the middle of us eating it felt like we were being rushed out of the restaurant and it wasnt even a busy night!  Fourthly I had to hunt her down to get us more fries, its unlimited steak fries why am I waiting to get more of these? If you run past my table look to see that they are all gone and refill them.  Fifthly I let her know that we needed the check separated and I had a to go order for my husband she quickly seemed very inconvenienced by this, which is ridiculous because the higher my bill the higher your tip. Also in this economy I dont go out to eat very much so when I do I expect great customer service.  Lastly I am a red robin rewards member and I had a coupon for a free dessert she asked me to write the number down on the receipt and she would apply that for me. I wrote down the whole member number for her to come back and rudely tell me she can not do it by the member number it has to be the phone number. Ok.....so I gave her the number. My biggest complaint here is why doesn't red robin ask about the rewards program? Your company really pushed it when I got it and its a great deal but I have never had not a single server ask me if I was a rewards member.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-olympia?start=60,2.56,2.56,2.56,1.7000000000000002,2.56

The appetizers are not all that great, but if I am really hungry I order the zucchini and cheese fried sticks.  The kids meals are very plain, but make for a good inexpensive lunch, just sprinkle the food with the season salt provided at the table.  It's about the same cost as Burger King but at Red Robins you get better fries and a larger meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-olympia?start=80,2.36,2.36,2.36,1.832,2.36

Sometimes I can barely finish a burger...then you have your bottomless fries (that you can substitute with broccoli, sweet potato fries, etc)! I highly suggest their onion rings if you aren't a huge French fry fan, they are really tasty. We have tried a few appetizers and they have been pretty yummy. I'm a big fan of their chili...it has a perfect kick to it and is super meaty and filling! Their wings were cooked good and also had nice flavor.  The bar area has great service. We have seated ourselves each time and the wait staff is always attentive or apologetic if they take a little bit to come to your table (which doesn't happen often, but they are a really busy location).

He explained that they had egg on site but those were only to be cooked for the burgers. their hard boiled eggs come already cooked and the place where they get them back in the Midwest had a bird issue and they had to slaughter over a million birds, (great ting to tell a customer before they eat a meal)  and corporate didn't want them cooking eggs for health reasons. .. but you just told us you have them to cook for burgers? When the salad did arrive (almost 45 min later) it was missing the chicken, we had to ask out server if it was missing and he brought it out on a separate plate.  I also had salad with my meal and I spent a good 5 minutes before I ate it picking out all the slimy lettuce, and when I say slimy i mean you can see through it slimy. I picked around it because we didn't have time to wait for another one. I asked for no cheese, and found a few shreds in my salad as well as melted under my chicken, not a big deal, but if I had been someone who was allergic it could have had a reaction. when our server checked in I explained all the things wrong and asked him to please notify the kitchen so other guests would not be affected, I do not remember receiving an apology and certainly no offer of compensation. I would steer clear of here!!! *update* corporate reached out after seeing this and gave me a $25 gift card, and said they would make sure the location in question was notified.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-olympia?start=60,2.16,2.16,2.16,1.6680000000000001,2.16

The hostess was walking by so I asked her, she had no clue because she hadn't 'messed with them enough' and referred us to Sarah.

Tonight after some Christmas shopping we stopped at red Robbin for some dinner. We waited about 20 mins to sit and once seated we quickly ordered some appetizers the pretzel bites and the poutine WITHOUT MUSHROOMS. We waited some time for them as the kitchen was backed up, upon arrival everything looked good my husband started in on the pretzels I looked over the poutine for mushrooms and didn't see any so I took a bite of the fry covered in gravy and cheese...after eating that steak fry I looked down and there under the top layer of fries lay a bunch of mushrooms. My husband jumped up to get the waitress and she took our fries. Less then 3 minutes later a ""new"" poutine came out, it was cold and from the way it came out looked like someone had just picked the mushrooms out, I asked the waitress if this had been made completely mushroom free because of my allergies I didn't feel comfortable eating it, she said she was sorry and she wouldn't feel comfortable eating it as well, and would have them make me a new poutine without mushrooms. The item charge was taken off our bill and the 3rd time it came out great.... I started feeling sick half way into the hour long wait it took for us to get our cold burgers, our 11 month old was over this experience as well thankfully he was being as great as he could be as we had now been there for almost 2 hrs. I realized on our ride home I was having an allergic reaction I started dry heaving and then started throwing up, I called the manager and his customer service came off rude as he repeated over and over ""what am I suppose to do about it.""

23,Al G.,"Olympia, WA",0,5,,1.0,2016-06-18,"Prior to last night, I had never had an issue with Red Robin. My spouse and I decided to eat at Red Robin last night to celebrate. We ordered our food and our server verified our order. I let my sever know that I have a gluten allergy and specifically asked for a lettuce wrap. My server repeated my order with a lettuce wrap substituted for a bun. When my burger arrived, it was placed in a wheat bun. After trying to get my server's attention for over 10 minutes, she finally came over and asked if everything was okay. I told her I had a gluten allergy and asked for the entire burger to be remade. She apologized and took the burger back. After a few minutes, I was presented with a burger in a lettuce wrap. There were crumbs from the bun on the plate - the entire burger had not been remade. The cooks had simply but the burger in a lettuce wrap after I had specified I had a gluten allergy. I tried to get the attention of my server but was unable to for about another 10 minutes. Finally, when I got the attention of my server, I told her that the entire meal needed to be remade because of my gluten allergy. She took my meal away. After 30 minutes of waiting, my meal arrived. I had specifically asked for garlic alioli, as I knew that sauce was gluten free. The sauce on the burger was chipolte aioli, which I was uncertain was gluten free. I again had to wait 7 minutes to try and get the attention of my server before clarifying that the sauce was gluten free. The turkey burger was black and almost inedible because it was burnt, but at this point, I was so frustrated that I didn't care. When my spouse and I went to pay for the meal, we noticed that $20 was taken off the meal. The turkey burger and garlic fries were rung in twice and added an additional $2.75 to the meal. When I asked the server about why this was, she snapped that she had to ring the order in again to have the burger remade and her manager only took $20 off the tab. I asked her to please take off the additional $2.75, as I was not going to pay for a meal that I was unsatisfied with. My spouse and I paid in cash. Our server returned to our table with incorrect change. She gave us $2 instead of $2.06.

I've been to this location a hand full of times, mostly because they have a strong coupon game and it's an excuse to not cook sometimes. Normally I don't really look to deeply into the quality of chain restaurants, but tonight was a particularly horrible experience. I guess what should have tipped me off was that they won't let you order anything under medium well. Even Applebees let's you order a medium rare burger because they don't use frozen meats. Red Robin does apparently. Really poor quality frozen meat at that. That's really nasty. Secondly, the waiter kinda berated us into buying more food and drinks and told us to smile. In other words, annoying. He also refused to use a coupon that would have been valid and taken 50% off of one of our entrees, even though it was valid for my friend's entree. Instead he took off one of the drinks because he wanted us to stay and drink more.  All of that was pretty terrible, but the kicker was the all night gut cramps followed by an unpleasant morning of hellish evacuation. I'm still kinda sick.  This is not a good place for a burger.

I asked our server if I could have fries instead of the broccoli because it wasn't good. ( not sure why they served the brown broccoli in the first place.) I then noticed that our server charged us $199 for the fries. So I talked to the manager and she said she would take care of it. So the server had to come over and tell us that she charged us because we shared them. WOW! Since when at Red Robin do people not share their fries?! (Btw the table behind us got 2-rounds of fries with each person getting their own basket plus the fries that come with their meal initially.) not sure why our server had to come over to explain anything anyway?

15,John D.,"Olympia, WA",0,3,,5.0,2017-10-21,"Two words Kevin and Cody. These two guys provided the BEST customer service we have ever received at Red Robin. Kevin was our waiter and he made sure the drinks were full, we had enough fries and everyone was happy. For a group of 10 this is no easy task and he handled it. Definitely was delivering GOLD STANDARD 5 star service. Cody, I believe was a manager, also came by to make sure everyone was doing well and happy with everything. I wish every place we ate paid attention to detail and cared about customer satisfaction as much as these guys. Food was great, service was EXCELLENT, can't ask for much more then that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-olympia,2.2,2.18,2.18,,2.188
11,Troy A.,"Olympia, WA",12,12,,1.0,2017-10-29,"Went to Red Robin to celebrate our exchange student's 16th birthday because she loves their shakes. Waited 25 minutes then was sat at our table. Waitress took 5 minutes to address us with I'll be back in ""a second"" to bring our place settings. 8 minutes later comes back to take our drink order. I asked about the free birthday burger, But she denied it because we did register or exchange student on our loyalty card 24hrs before coming to the restaurant.  Then we all were going to order Monster shakes, but she told us that they are out of milk and therefore out of shakes. ""There is a Safeway across the street!"" How does a restaurant known for their shakes run out of shakes? So we disappointingly ordered sodas. Then we attempted to order an appetizer, but again we were told they were out of the appetizer. We had to leave and go to another restaurant to get our birthday girl her shake and burger. Red Robin, you failed this customer. It will be awhile before we give you another chance or our money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-olympia,2.2,2.17,2.17,,2.1820000000000004
4,Daisy S.,"Olympia, WA",363,7,,1.0,2017-10-29,"It was my birthday and I called in to order my free birthday burger! When I came to pick it up they wouldn't give it to me for free because I hadn't made an account already. I offered to make one on the spot but they said it takes 24 hours to process. I spoke to the manager, Cody, who was very kind but wouldn't budge on the burger and was trying to make me pay $15 for the burger even though I was alone on my birthday and I kind of started crying a little bit :( A nice stranger stepped up and bought it for me, but I can't believe they would rather throw out food and send me away on my DAY OF BIRTH all sad instead of sacrificing 15 of their corporate dollars.

5,Yen T.,"Santa Barbara, CA",7,10,3.0,1.0,2017-12-02,The family voted Red Robin for the nostalgic feel tonight (as I'm visiting from out of state) and was very disappointed by the lack of attentiveness from our server (no checking in and no drink refilled).

2,Junie J.,"Lacey, WA",0,15,,1.0,2018-01-06,I went here for lunch on New Years eve. Food was good but I never got the campfire sauce I asked for. Not really a big deal but still irritating.Our waitress was very unattentive. Apparently her friends were at the next table and she was more interested in visiting with them than doing her job. Also there were waitresses all around the restaurant doing their makeup. This is the third time in a row i've had shitty service here. I won't be back. There are so many better places to eat.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-olympia,2.08,2.08,2.08,,2.08
