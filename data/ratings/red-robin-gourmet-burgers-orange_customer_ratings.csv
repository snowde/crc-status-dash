The service is good, and being able to pick up food to go here is wonderful! We always seem to be a busy family on the run! The Village of Orange is pretty busy, especially on weekends, but finding a restaurant where picking up food is quick and easy is quite the find. With a ""10 minute parking"" for picking up food (or ""30 minute parking"" when the 10 minute parking spots are full), we really like this added convenience. Whether we eat here or take food to go, the service is also really good here! While my husband usually gets a salad, I usually order the Whiskey River Chicken Burger. It's messy and delicious. With the just the right amount of barbecue sauce, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and onions on this burger, I am perfectly content after my meal here. Add some of the best onion rings ever, and I'm in heaven! My husband's salads are always hearty and delicious as well. We really like the convenience, service, and most of all, food at this Red Robin location.

My food came out longer than I expected, but that's probably because there were so many big groups before me.  I ordered the whiskey river BBQ burger, which was about $10 and comes with a side of fries. The hamburger itself was not bad..it wasn't messy and the flavors were good. It was also cooked all the way through like I asked. The fries aren't good plain in my opinion. I suggest you sprinkle the fries seasoning on them.

We asked our server what sauces they had for there appetizers and after rattling off all that they offer, she actually came back with all of them just so we could try them. Scored big points from me because I like things saucy ;-) The burgers are huge and almost fall apart but with the good buns they use, I can still manhandle them into my mouth with only minimal drippage on my hands. Love the continuous basket of fries, they come out hot and they bring them to you before I shamefully have to ask for more. Who doesn't have room for more french fries in their lives?

I go for the bottomless steak fries coupled with gobs of ranch, drenched in RR seasoning, with a huge dollop of ketchup in the middle of the cup. Sounds nasty but the concoction is truly delicious. I order the Whiskey River burger with egg (split in half), and sit outside so I can smell Tuwanda and Juanita smoking their Kool and Kent cigarettes (respectively) at the entrance of the Orange ""Mall,"" or Village or whatever the hell it is while I listen to the cheesy mall music over the loudspeaker, coupled with the squeaky entrance doors that need to be oiled, which add a saxophone-like break to the shitty music. If it's summertime, you can usually sit and wonder what the hell all the parentless children are doing in their Fruit of the Looms, running through the mall fountain, which is a huge plus if you're a sick pervert.

There were flimsy, soggy, doughy jalapeño chips on it that was gross. They had tomatoes AND salsa on the burger which tasted so bad. I was so confused as to what was going on in my mouth. It was beyond disgusting. The whole burger was lukewarm on the verge of cold and sloppy. There was also a whole jalapeño stabbed through with a wooden spike on my burger. I guess they tried to get fancy...am I supposed to eat the fucking jalapeño? Why would someone just eat a whole burnt jalapeño? I wanted to exchange the burger, but I didn't want my food spat it.

Then the manager brought it out and I told him the pickles were missing so please can I have them on the side with tartar? He said ""I'll just go tell your server."" NEVER have I had a manager say that to me..whenever there is something wrong, the manager happily brings things out. When we asked the manager for something else last night..again, he acted as though it was a chore for him. WTH? Disappointing.  The server brings out the check. My sister had given her a cake when we got there..so she forgot that, which was no big. So she brings out the cakes..just the cake. What are we going to cut and eat it with? Our hands??? So I'm like ""umm can we have a knife, forks, and some plates?"" She sighs and go gets them.  And my birthday song? So we told them that too. I can't believe how disappointing the service was yesterday. I come to this  location at least once a week..I come here every year on my birthday and wow..rude service.

The food was great, the service was great and at the end of my meal I received a card signed by some of the staff at Red Robin thanking me for my service that I actually still have in my car. It means a lot when a restaurant not only appreciates a regular customer but when they appreciate a vet that's a different kinda of customer service.

69,Brandon M.,"Fullerton, CA",24,153,7.0,2.0,2015-06-13,"Came here for my first time last night (Friday the 12th). Right off the bat this location grabbed my interest due to its larger size and unique layout. I usually go to the Brea location, so this was something a little different (despite being the same restaurant)... My party was greeted upon arrival and waited roughly 10 minutes for a seat. I saw quite a few open seats, but didn't feel the need to question the hostess's seating techniques. Once we got our seats, it was only a few minutes before our waitress, Alyssa, came by. She was/is extremely attractive (just had to put that out there), but unfortunately very inattentive to our table. Took a while to get our water cups, order food, get refills, etc - the whole meal basically lagged. Then to top it off, we asked for our separate bills so we could pay and leave, and that also took forever. Once we got them, we slipped our cards with our respective bills hoping she would take them back quickly, but of course that didn't happen. I did notice Alyssa was constantly bouncing around in the bar area, so her attention seemed more focused around there. This location should reconsider bar employees also being table waiters away from the bar, as that doesn't seem to be working. While I would normally suspect slower service on a busy and/or understaffed day (which is the common excuse), it was nothing like that. There were plenty of employees working that night, and it was not busy (compared to say, a saturday evening).. The food was ok. I got my personal favorite, the royal red robin burger. While it wasn't terrible, it definitely wasn't up to standard. There was a ridiculous amount of mayonnaise on it. Others in my party complained that their food was undercooked, and the fries tasted as though they had been sitting for quite some time (not even warm by the time they got to us). With all this considered, I cant say I was too impressed with this location or the food. They have some ghetto looking females working at this spot (not including Alyssa), and while the location itself is pretty nice - the food and poor service kills it for me. Maybe we came on a bad night, but seeing other recent reviews tells me I am not the only one.. Perhaps with a little motivation, the managers/employees can get a better routine down.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orange?start=60,3.4,3.5,3.5,2.536,3.4600000000000004

I cringe every time I take my (very) energetic six year old to dinner. He is a boy who is wired for talkative antics that would rival the Energizer Bunny for days. And tonight was no different. Yes, I am that Mom with a child whose actions embarrass me so much that I blush with a very apologetic smile to the other patrons, as if to say ""I only wanted Red's delicious Bacon Cheeseburger - please bear with me."" But tonight was different and that is all thanks to our waiter Wilson. We were greeted at our table shortly after we were seated and Wilson's gracious demeanor was somewhat of a relief for me, telling me without even saying that it was going to be okay, and that the meal I was set to have would make things better. Which they did; Wilson took the children's order and swiftly returned with their drinks. The rest of our food was brought out in a timely manner as well as every time we asked for something; Wilson gladly brought back what we needed - even if it was the 4th cup of ranch dressing to accompany Red's delicious and bottomless steak fries. All that to say this: thank you to the evening shift's Rockstar - otherwise known as Wilson. Your patience with our very loud table is much appreciated. Great and exceptional employees within the Food & Service Industry are what make great dining experiences and are the building blocks to earning patron loyalty.

Corporate has changed what was the BEST cobb salad around into the WORST cobb salad around.  No more romaine lettuce - now a handful of iceberg with a small dab of spring mix.  Doesn't work on a cobb salad.  They got rid of the eggs and olives.  They are now putting cucumber instead of the egg.  The portion size is less than half of the original salad size.  The ONLY thing that hasn't changed is the chicken.  It is still the same portion and still good.  At BEST maybe a tablespoon of each of the condiments are put on now.  No longer the chibata bread, but two small slices of cheaper buttered / garlic bread.  My guess is that they are trying to make more money.  This is the wrong way of going about it.  Increase the menu price if you have to, but I felt SO ripped off having to pay for that bad tasting garbage last night.  They have lost a VERY loyal customer (I'm in there one to two times a week just for the Avo-Cobbo salad).  I'm angry that I have to go try other restaurants to find another cobb salad that is equal to what Red Robin used to have.  Lazy Dog's cobb salad was pretty good but I don't want to drive that far for dinner from where I am.   The staff at the Orange restaurant are great -- especially Ryan and Emily.  I will miss them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orange?start=120,3.36,3.49,3.49,2.468,3.438

The new design felt less home-y and more corporate. It was also waaay too bright. Probably had twice as many lights as they needed. The patio off the bar was gone, due to the new mall construction I'm assuming, and the ambiance was just not what it used to be. I felt like I lost a part of my childhood! The service was average-it was packed so it took longer than normal for a server to take drink orders, bring utensils, etc. Food was good though!

The chili was kinda gross too. We then I ordered fries with American cheese, thousand island dressing and bacon bits, and even that was bad. They put down the fries, then the Thousand Island, then melted the cheese on top of that making it all a soggy mess. They call it dressing because it goes on last...it goes fries, cheese, then dressing.  I'm sorry to say the food here at this visit sucked.

I would have given it five stars, but the floors were very dirty and the tables were left un attended for a while after customers left.  My waiter, Julio was fantastic!!! Always checking on me.

We told him we're weren't ready for food orders yet, by check back in a few minutes.   He came back five minutes later and took our orders.  We had their steak fries and onion rings were appetizers. The steak fries were fresh and had a good crunch. The onion rings had the perfect amount of bread/onion. And the dipping sauce was amazing. I ordered the Marco pollo, which is grilled chicken with peppered bacon and arugula. The chicken was cooked well; super juicy. And the bacon was a perfect crisp. I don't remember what everyone else ordered, but everyone enjoyed their burgers. Our drinks were refilled once they were about 1/3 full; which was awesome service. I haven't seen that anywhere else. For dessert, we got their tower of donuts. The diameter of the donuts was about 2.5-3 inches; so a good amount; not too big, not too small. The texture is very similar to a cronut if you've ever had one before. Fluffy and not too fried. All in all, it was a great fast meal.

It's just one of those places you end up because one of your friends has a craving specifically for one of their burgers.  Does this sound familiar? Because that is why I ended up at Red Robin. Place was pretty packed for a nondescript Thursday night.  TGIT!  What do vegetarians or pescetarians eat at this joint? Probably the Garden Burger, which is what I got.  It's a veggie patty (Garden burger brand) with lettuce, tomato, pickle, and a mustard sauce.  It wasn't particularly memorable, hence why I did not take a photo of it.  I could have made this at home.  The fries are bottomless + delicious = a combination that makes America overweight (but yolo am I right?). They are unseasoned so you can DIY with the little seasoning shaker they have at the table.  I upended half the shaker onto my fries 'cuz that stuff is powdered gold.  Service was great! Our waitress was incredibly kind and attentive and patient when we all asked for 1,000 dipping sauces for our 1,000,000 fries.   Will I come back? Yes, when my friends force me to. I've been told they can replace any meat burger with the veggie patty.  Maybe I'll give that a go the next time around.  My whole thing with these types of chain restaurants is that they all run together in my memory like watercolors in a white rafting river.  Was this place Applebees?

However, we have been back twice recently. One thing I can say is that I am happy that they installed digital menus in the bar that are equipped with payment stations so it makes paying by a lot easier when you are ready to leave.  This is an unfortunate necessity at this location because it would otherwise take an excessive amount of time to get your tab from the bartender. This doesn't represent the service of the bartender, they are simple too overwhelmed to handle the entire bar and seating area in the bar along with drinks for the whole restaurant. I can understand having one bartender during the slow times but the bartender seemed to be way too busy to handle everything himself. He took it all in stride and all of our interactions were pleasant. I actually feel bad for him.  Long story short, expect to wait an extended amount of time for your food and drinks if you sit in the bar area.  The food is ok for what it is and I can appreciate the good happy hour that they have.

One of the managers came out and took the appetizer off our bill.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orange?start=40,3.76,3.05,3.05,,3.334
4,Patrick W.,"Orange, CA",0,5,,1.0,2017-09-07,"We have been enjoying Red Robin for at least 14 years.. The food is always exactly as ordered and the sit down service is always great. The problem comes in when you order online for pick up... The two times we have done it, they forget items, the wait after arriving at the suggested pick up time the first time was almost 1 hour and this time tonight was over an hour and a half... Each time we asked, we were told they were working on our order... The first time, our food sat on the back counter and we kept asking them to check if that was ours and they kept saying it wasn't... After waiting for the hour, I went behind the counter and saw that it was ours... They said sorry, handed the bags to us and proceeded to forget the shakes that were ordered as well.  The second time, tonight's order, was almost the same story except they didn't bring the food out and leave it, it stayed in the back and sat... The reason I know both times the food sat is because all of the meals ($90 worth of food) was cold, all of it... So, ordering for pick up will never happen again for my family. Like I stated, if you are eating in the food and service are terrific... Avoid the take out idea....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orange?start=20,3.76,3.05,3.05,,3.334

It's been ages since we've been to one and things have really changed for the better!! My sister came over last week and we trying to figure out what we wanted for dinner, I'm a creature of comfort so I go to the same places LOL! She mentioned going to RR since it's so close to our house, we came in around 8ish on a Sunday night and it was perfect! The dinner rush was over and there was no wait! First off the menu is HUGE!! It took us a good minute to go over it, we really couldn't make  up our mind! We did have an amazing server named Allison, she was on point! She knew her stuff and remembered everything! She got our order right and never forgot anything! If you don't find anything on this menu then something is wrong with you! We started with the chicken wings and they are delicious!! Super crispy and tasty! These rank pretty high up with there with some of our favorite spots! My sister ordered a non burger LOL, a crossiant turkey sandwich with bacon, and avocado, my mom kept it simple with a double tavern burger and coleslaw. All of us enjoyed our food so much! It was delicious! I took my food home to go and ate it later and it was crack! My favorite was the chili! It has a good flavor to it, not too spicy or bland. I ate almost the whole cup it was that good! I took home a kids meal and a side of mac and cheese, I was a bit disappointed with the mac, it was bland and lacking flavor which I was surprised because everything else was so flavorful and on point!  Red Robin has renewed my faith in them immensely! I already want to go back! LOL! ^____^",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orange,3.84,3.05,3.05,,3.366

17,Virginia C.,"Santa Ana, CA",0,3,,1.0,2017-10-04,"Went in last night about 8:15 and sat in the bar area. Place was not busy and service was slow. Husband ordered fish and chips with a beer, I ordered soup and salad, and a glass of wine. Fish was a little overcooked and very little fries. Good thing the fries are bottomless, problem was he was never asked if he wanted more. When we finally flagged someone down to ask for more, we never received them. Waitress who didn't wait on us apologized and  someone, I think he was the manager, never told us who he was offered us some fries for take home. Really, like I want to take some home so I can eat them cold. My soup was French Onion and only 2 positive things that could be said about it was the cheese and it was hot. It was a bit on the salty side. They should not say bottomless fries unless they keep to their word. This is not the first time this has happened and I am sure that it won't be the last. This place is hit and miss, last night was a huge miss for us, so disappointing, we only so our waitress once, I couldn't even remember who she was. I stop by every so often because it is near my place of employment and we can get seated right away, like I wrote, it is not very busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orange?start=20,3.88,3.08,3.08,,3.4000000000000004
112,Renee M.,"Garden Grove, CA",268,360,499.0,2.0,2017-10-15,"I was super disappointed today.  We went to Red Robin to celebrate my Mm's birthday.  I was asked to find a place that fir the family friendly criteria,  a place that would be cool if my nephew get loud or has trouble sitting still (he is moderate to severe autistic) and they had to have French fries for afore mentioned nephew and it needed to be in Orange. We all eat pretty healthy, ranging from Vegan to no processed foods to a diabetic diet.  I know they offer a vegan burger patty, salads, soups and fries so it kinda fits all the criteria.  We are greeted ad after a short we are seated.  We ask a few questions of our waiter and order tea's and waters.  Out tea's arrive and the ice had totally melted so the waiter says he will be back with ice for our drinks and takes our order.  I order the Vegi burger, vegan.  Buttercup get a modified version of the same, my mother gets the chicken soups,  my brother a grilled chicken salad and of course chicken nuggets and fries my nephew.  The waiter comes back and informs us that the bun has egg in it so I modify my burger into a lettuce wrap. (still no ice).  About 10 minutes goes by and a waitress comes by to inform us our waiter is going on break and she will take cover for us.  We request some ice and she offers to bring us fresh drink.  She delivers fresh drinks and ice for us soon after our waiter comes by to let us know that he is going on break,  we inform him she has been by and brought us our ice.   Our food is delivered soon after and I have several giant pieces of iceberg lettuce, two slices of tomato a little onion and a few pickles.  There is no way I'm eating this burger style with my hands. So I cut it up and eat it in that manner, I would have been great to have more condiments like tomato and pickle.  I did not want fries so I ordered the freckled fruit kinda wondering what the even meant, well it was just awful. it was the sweetened strawberries that are used in the strawberry lemonade, with what I think was canned pineapple and some orange pieces and apples.  Super disappointing because the strawberry things were a sugar bomb and got all over the rest of the fruit. Basically I left still hungry.  Oh and two members of our party ordered the endless fries, and the portion was small on the initial plate,  when more were requested 1 small plate was brought for my daughter (17) and my nephew (10) to share across the table from each.  Umm ok... Additionally, we were there for a birthday. Based on the gifts at the table, the waiter asked if it was a birthday which we acknowledged with a yes.  I think he forgot to pass that along because the B-day song never happened.   I was a little relieved by this, but still my Mom was disappointed when it was all said and done.  Over all the food was typical chain garbage and the staff, the waiter was terrible and the waitress was a little better.  I give 2 stars for the effort of the chain to offer a vegan patty especially one that isn't the typical black bean patty that you get everywhere and for the waiter who let me know that the bun had eggs in it opposed to just bringing it and not caring.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orange,3.92,3.08,3.08,,3.4160000000000004
110,Joey H.,"Costa Mesa, CA",1,15,139.0,3.0,2017-11-03,Do not order the fish and chips at a burger place! I should have known better.

100,Ryan S.,"Orange, CA",36,187,203.0,5.0,2017-11-27,"Haven't visited a Red Robin in many years and decided to give it a shot again.  Nice welcoming staff right when you walk in the door.  Cool technology on each table to allow you to order, call for waiter or even pay by card.  We ordered two burgers and a endless French fries basket.  Burger was cooked exactly as ordered and was flavored very well. All the ingredients tasted fresh and of good quality.  The steak fries were delicious, can't find steak fries to many places anymore so it was really nice to be able to get them here like a good old classic diner.  The waiter went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of and we always had fries and full drinks on our table.  I will most definitely be back again to enjoy one of their several different burger options.  Great work guys! Thanks for making me a believer again in Red Robin",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orange,4.0,3.14,3.14,,3.4840000000000004
111,Niccolette R.,"Fullerton, CA",1,18,5.0,1.0,2017-12-01,"I've never had a bad experience at a Red Robin location but tonight was not good. I had ordered a monster milkshake which includes the tin with the milkshake in it. I was trying to pour some of it in the glass and it all came out at once which cause milkshake to go everywhere. I had to clean up the milkshake and when I told the waitress Emily about it she said ""oh I'm sorry"". She didn't offer any compensation or anything for a milkshake I didn't get to really have. On top of that they took 20 minutes to get fries out, she told me three times that the fries will be out shortly. When the fries came there was practically nothing in the basket. I feel like I've wasted my time and money on this place. Definitely not coming back and I don't recommend to anyone at all. I'll stick to Brea Mall where they have fast and great customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orange,3.84,3.13,3.13,,3.414

This place is literally the only red robin who doesn't screw stuff up, seats you instantly, gets the order right. 5 star for them to make up for the picky idiots leaving 1 star because they think they are at some 5 star vegan restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orange,3.72,3.14,3.14,,3.3720000000000008
