I specified NO MUSHROOMS on my bleu cheese burger... it came loaded with them!  Paid extra for the garlic cheese fries... very greasy... Loudmouth's parmesan-garlic fries are MUCH better and they don't charge you extra when you choose a flavored variety of fries!Won't be back... over priced... burger had great flavor (except for mushrooms) but not at that price!

We expected a longer wait. About 30 minutes after ordering our food arrives. I ordered my usual: a Banzai Burger, no pink, with garlic fries (y'all know I'm the Fry Snob). Everyone else's food was perfect, but my burger was so pink, there's no way it should have taken a half hour to arrive. I asked for a new burger, and they brought me a basket of fries while I wait. Our server was super nice about everything. A manager was going around checking on tables, so, I asked him to make mine to go since we had to get back to work. He brings my order, and I notice something's off:  This Banzai is on a ciabatta roll This Banzai has arugula and sun dried tomatoes on it This Banzai has garlic aioli This Banzai is not a Banzai. It's a D.G.B. This D.G.B. has a side of onion rings with it. I'M THE **bleeping** FRY SNOB!  We were already running so late, I just decided to accept the burger and leave. I guess some other customer got stuck with my well done Banzai. I get back to work and take a bite of the burger. Yep... you guessed it... PINK. Thankfully they comped my meal. Tears wet my keyboard as I write this review. Sadly this Red Robin just isn't ready for prime time. I've been a fan of Red Robin for 15 years and this was easily the worst visit ever.

However the burger comes out half an hour later. And the sad part is you would be better off at McDonalds. At least the burger would have flavor and the meal wouldn't cost you 50 bucks. Oh and there was no alcohol envolved for that price. So unless you can eat that much of the bottomless fries save your money and go for fast food. You may not have a wait person to serve you but you get better taste and more for your money.  You may not got a balloon but you could pick one up at the store on the way home with less aggravation.

32,Keith S.,"Orlando, FL",0,33,178.0,1.0,2016-09-13,"My first and last visit to this resteraunt and here is why:      We were a party of 2 which is the easiest for any server. I know this because I have worked as a resteraunt server, cook, driver, cashier, runner and manager of many different  food service venues including fast food and full service.      We both ordered a sandwich. I chose the unlimited salad refills as my side and my wife ordered the garlic fries. Our food was brought to us by someone other than our server. My wife was given someone else's sandwich. When they brought a second sandwich, it still wasn't what she ordered and we still have not seen our server since we placed our order. I did get 1 salad refill from our server when she finally made an appearance to our table. I never got another because she never returned until we were done eating.       The fries were greasy and soggy. The sandwiches were small and no different than what can be purchased at other and least expensive venues. My drink was never refilled and our table was never pre-bussed. Our bill for this experience was just under $30.00. The food was in no way worth the price!! It's a good thing for the server that my wife left a $3.00 tip because I would have tipped the spare change in my pocket.        The sad part is this is a brand new store and my experience has been that the opening crew are the best because they receive the best training. What a waste of a new building.       I am being generous giving this one 2 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orlando-3?start=40,2.052,2.052,2.052,2.052,2.052

We both had water w/ lemon. Pretty easy and simple to order right? It comes out with no ice and no lemon. You got to be kidding me!? What is this a jail!? We ordered two new buzz Mac n cheese burgers. Asked for no lettuce. They both come 30 minutes later with lettuce on it. The picture showed that the burger had loaded yellow Mac and cheese on it. Now our burgers had 3 pieces of macaroni and white cheese sauce which you had to look for to see it. Whatever other aioli sauce was on there, wasn't even present. The fries bottomless!? What fries!?? They gave us Literally 10 fries that were horrible and we asked for one of the no charge dipping sauces. She brings out ketchup. We asked for the Red Robin tavern sauce which is pretty much 1000 island dressing. We never saw the server again. So nice we could pay at the table and leave no tip without feeling the guilt. She deserved her tip of nothing. The moment we walked in and got the eye roll about asking for a seat in the dining area was a clue that we should have walked the heck out. They honestly expect you to sit at the bar or at the high top tables that have no room at all!? Honestly this place could close and be tore down and made a parking lot, I wouldn't even care. It's that horrible and I hope everyone takes this review seriously because I'm not kidding about this place. It's gone down hill since they opened and now I'd say rock bottom. I'll never, ever give this place a try again. I'm done with Red Robin. I'll keep my business for a hamburger with checkers or McDonald's. For the owners that may read this: Please just close and leave the neighborhood, your business isn't wanted not only by me, but several others by the looks of it.   If you can't get a simple order right on a slow night, you shouldn't operate a restaurant at all. Especially an order of ice water with lemon! I will be calling corporate but I doubt they will even care either. Most of these places can give a crap less about your opinions. They just expect you to take your opinion and shove it.

Well, after dining there for the first time last night, The Thrill is Gone. I ordered the burger that made them famous. It had lettuce tomato relish and onion. I requested no cheese. The bread was dry and crumbling apart yet the bottom bun soaked in relish. The burger was thin, dry and overcharred. It seemed pre-cooked and very processed.

She finally came with one batch and said another was coming. But it was taking way too long and so we left.

It's not a place we would go regularly.  The kids menu had lots of choices and the endless fries were a big hit. The pizza didn't look the best but that's what they wanted. It came with a choice of side -- everything from veggies to apple slices.  Meanwhile there is a full bar for adults. Happy hour prices on a number of items all the time. The margarita was good.  The regular menu features burgers, but there are salads, sides, soups, chicken, fish, etc. I didn't like my chicken Caesar  wrap especially and the onion soup (soup and sandwich combo) wasn't hot enough and was too salty. The cod fish and chips were very good, however, and one of the guys liked his burger (it came with a fried egg on top!). For dessert we ordered their tower of cronuts -- these came with two dipping sauces (chocolate and strawberry). These were excellent -- served warm almost like a beignet and the warm chocolate sauce was good as well.

It was expensive.  We paid $36 for one beer, one lemonade, a small order of onions rings and one burger.  I could have gotten the same with happy hour at Chilis for a lot less money !!!

Honestly, I rather go to Five Guys or steak and shake cause I know I'll get a way better tasting burger and milk shake than what I got here. Not everything is bad about Red Robbins. They do offer endless sides with your burger and I ordered sweet potato fries but again, even the fries were nothing special. I tried their Oreo cookie milkshake and it was way too thick for me. For food, I ordered a BBQ burger and it just wasn't anything special. It's fresh and cooked the way I like it but I wasn't blown away.

Our waitress did a great job but clearly she was flustered/overworked/trying to juggle too much at the same time so that in itself set an awkward tone from the start. Sometimes we'd have to wait for something we asked for but we were understanding of her situation. We were all starving so we order the bottomless floats. The ice cream quality was great, and I like that they give you additional rootbeer so that you can add as much or as little as you like. I wanted something basic so I order the tavern burger. Double meat patty, cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickle, onion, sauce on the side. That also came with bottomless fries which I didn't take advantage of because I got full pretty quick just from the first float. The burger itself was really nothing different than what you'd get out of a BK, and there really isn't much else to say about it. The steak fries were hot, and tasty, especially alongside their bbq sauce. So I'm torn between a 2 and 3 stars but upon comparing to other burger places that are around that are offering good quality ingredients at a similar price I have to go with 2, and while yes I have experienced better, I wouldn't be completely against returning either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orlando-3,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.6000000000000005,2.48

I've been to this particular location three times and so far I've liked it, they have a variety of burgers from inexpensive to pricey but the food is good!  I got the Tavern burger for $6.99 with there bottomless fries and OMG, the burger had an exquisite sauce, campfire sauce, reminds me a bit of the Chick Fil A sauce :) The only thing that bothered me is that when I went the second time when it wasn't busy, they didn't offer me more fries, so just make sure to tell them you want more because it's a hit or miss depending on the server.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orlando-3,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68

We tend to go when it's not busy or packed as I don't want my food rushed and cold or don't feel like waiting for a long time.  The first time when it recently opened of course the manager stopped by to introduce himself and tells us about the rewards program, the second time it wasn't even that busy and the server didn't really check on us or offer us more fries and last night it wasn't busy and it took about 5 minutes to get seated bc the hostess was cleaning tables and didn't see us and the gentleman behind us however, the server did offer us more fries.  It breaks my heart giving this location a three because there food is on point but I am HUGE on service and this particular location does not seem strong on this.

I ordered my burger cooked medium, to which our waitress asked if I wanted it with some ""pink"" or ""no pink"". I told her that some pink was fine. The Smoke and Pepper burger is one of the better burgers I have had around town. And with an order of Red Robin's bottomless French fries, you don't have to worry about leaving hungry. The service was great, and the dining room was very clean. Red Robin also serves chicken sandwiches, ice cream/milkshakes, and has a full liquor bar. One person in our party is a fan of their onion rings. We followed up with a ice cream sundae with chocolate syrup for dessert. Caramel sauce, sprinkles, and other fun stuff is available for toppings.  Located on Semoran Boulevard near Orlando International Airport, this Red Robin is in a convenient location, with shopping and a movie theater nearby along with OIA.

We both like the Tavern Double, which comes with bottomless fries and we both get the bottomless root beer float. Normally we only make it through one float each cause they are HUGE. Food comes out fast and they are happy to put in a reorder of fries whenever you want it (if you want it).  The restaurant itself is divided into small section via walls and deco. There are fun decor pieces throughout, so take a look around, I especially like the large sized toy soldiers and rubik cube! A final fun aspect is that they have pay station at the table that you can also play games on for a $1.99 fee. Paying on the machine is free.

1,Luis A.,"Orlando, FL",22,11,,2.0,2017-11-19,The most expensive burger in town. The service is below average. The only good thing there are the onion rings but burgers are not. I had a full burger plate with fries and paid $12.00 that's beside drinks. Not recommended,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-orlando-3,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006
