10,Why W.,"Mazomanie, WI",12,61,3.0,1.0,2013-10-06,"My food was taken off the bill. I paid for the beer. I questioned going in the first place, as my fondness of RR has faded.  Used to enjoy their food. Now I end up feeling ill for several hours after the experience. Doesn't matter, any location - including the two in Madison. Guess RR is looking for a real fast food customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oshkosh,,,,,
15,Jackie A.,"Mount Prospect, IL",16,269,14.0,1.0,2013-10-17,"I went here with some colleagues and I was really excited for my A1 Peppercorn Burger because I like burgers, A1 sauce, and I love pepper, but was so disappointed with the salty burger I was served.  The atmosphere was nice, the service was good, and the sweet potato fries were good but I can't get past this terrible burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oshkosh,,,,,
17,Dave L.,"Clintonville, WI",0,16,,5.0,2014-06-28,Went here in Oshkosh wi great service I love the ff my burger came a little pink for my taste so sent it bad made a new one and all was good the family love going here I think if you haven't  tried you should you to will love it,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oshkosh,,,,,
13,Esther B.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,28,1.0,4.0,2014-07-24,"I love this place. You can get a delicious treat burger, or even lean chicken sandwich. Any burger can be substituted with a veggie burger (two different options), so it is very vegetarian friendly. The service is great, and the prices are fair.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oshkosh,,,,,
4,Karen L.,"Tuscaloosa, AL",81,615,3.0,2.0,2014-09-14,"On a rainy Sunday (Mother's Day, incidentally) shortly after moving into our house, the boyfriend and I decided to check this place out -- after all, we can practically walk here!  After something like a 45 minute wait for a table (again, Mother's Day, I get it), we were seated and placed our order.  The food took a loooong time to come, and it was not worth the wait.   The boyfriend's burger was way past the medium he'd requested, but given the wait, he didn't want to send it back and bargained with the waitress for a free beer instead.  The burger itself was nothing exciting, and the ""bottomless"" steak fries were obviously frozen, so the thought of more was not remotely attractive.  Now me, on the other hand, I'm the idiot that orders a salad at a burger joint.  For a $12 salad, it was pretty lame.  Blah lettuce, a few things thrown on top, and some chicken.  For the time and money it took, I could have done a lot better myself. The waitress was nice, but she clearly had too many tables and the kitchen was backed up til kingdom come.  Based on this experience, I would never go back to Red Robin.  And, side note, how are they part of the prize package for this season of Project Runway -- what?!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oshkosh,,,,,
11,Isaac A.,"Appleton, WI",58,241,459.0,4.0,2014-12-06,Red Robin is always a place I'm willing to go to. I have nothing bad to say and they are usually pretty quick!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oshkosh,,,,,
16,Jeff E.,"Oshkosh, WI",4,82,32.0,3.0,2015-01-01,"Not a bad burger place food wise, but not the best in town as an overall experience.  Upon entering the restaurant and being seated we had a little bit of a wait for our server but not too bad since they seemed busy.  We ordered the pretzel bites with cheese for an appetizer which were pretty good and came out fairly quick.  I did forget to mention that we ordered a bottomless root beer float which is a pretty cool deal I thought if you like root beer floats.  Either way they did keep them flowing throughout the meal so that was good.  The main issue that was experienced during this visit was the wait gap between appetizer and our meals being served.  We waited a very long time for our meals to come out and during the gap time our server was gone, no updates, no check on us to make sure we were okay, nothing.  After what was between a 20 and 30 minute wait, our meals came and the burgers were good but in my opinion lacked the gourmet part that is the signature of the place.  The burgers were good, just not something I feel I must return for.  The bottomless steak fries are a good deal but we didn't partake after being filled up.  Overall, not bad, but not great....3 Stars middle ground seems appropriate on this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oshkosh,,,,,
12,Susan B.,"Ocala, FL",0,15,,2.0,2015-07-11,I loved red robins chicken sandwiches.  A new supplier has rendered them tasteless. Dry and having a weird texture. I spoke with management several times and the supplier has not changed. My server recently said don't order a chicken sandwich. It's bad. Why is management not even listening to their own servers ??  I'm not going back to the robin for now,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oshkosh,,,,,
14,Shannon T.,"Oshkosh, WI",0,7,,5.0,2015-09-11,"Good food, good drinks, and good service. Love the new table machines for ordering apps and drink refills yourself and also the option to play games. It also didn't hurt that my server was pretty hot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oshkosh,,,,,
7,Amber B.,"Fond du Lac, WI",0,1,,2.0,2016-06-06,"Went for my birthday me and the hubby. Finally a night away from the kids for a breif second. Didnt sing to me. Didnt get anything. Ordered my burger no pink due to im pregnant. It came pink. Had to wait to have it redone. Didnt like my drink, asked to change and was charged for both. It was poor service! Waitstaff wasnt trying to upsell or announce featured products. Didnt even get the menu with the featured items. Wont go again. Fries were good. Not worth $46 for two people.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oshkosh,,,,,
9,Erica D.,"Waupun, WI",51,26,12.0,1.0,2016-06-10,Food was good- a bit over priced for a small portion. The server was rude and not helpful at all. My mom asked if she could have a different salad because the raspberry vinaigrette wasn't very good and apparently that was a huge inconvenience. As someone who has worked as a bartender and server- if you want to make good tips- have a good attitude. It's not that complex.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oshkosh,,,,,
2,Haley F.,"Milwaukee, WI",202,124,27.0,3.0,2016-06-28,"The location was very close to the HWY which was great for a quick sit down dining experience. Many roundabouts to navigate through to find the restaurant. I didn't enjoy the layout of the restaurant. It felt crammed.I ordered the original burger-- about $9.00. The burger was tasty and messy. The beef tasted freshhhhh! Which made me happy. The garlic aoli dipping sauce for the fries was great, but made for some epic heartburn. Our server Kaysie was super friendly and accommodating. The mai tai was awesome. Although I am almost certain I won't return just because I didn't like the set up inside the restaurant. It felt crammed and crowded, even though it was not near capacity and 2:00 in the afternoon. Thanks for the service Kaysie.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oshkosh,,,,,
6,Ted L.,"Kingsland, TX",18,74,1.0,5.0,2016-07-25,"I totally disagree with the 3 star rating. 5 stars is what they deserve. Sure, it a burger place but the service and attention to our needs can not easily be duplicated. Max,our waiter,was absolutely one of the best. Then the icing on the cake was Henry,the manager who reinforced our pleasurable experience. Well done Red Robin Oshkosh!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oshkosh,,,,,
5,John P.,"Milwaukee, WI",3,7,20.0,5.0,2016-07-29,Service was great. Had the bleu ribbon burger. It came out hot. Had bottomless fries. Great beer selection- had the Alaskan Amber- great to find that in Wisconsin. Derek was the server very professional and very quick. Great experience,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oshkosh,,,,,
8,Christine S.,"Oshkosh, WI",0,27,,4.0,2016-10-08,We have been eating at RR since it opened. Sometimes it goes through a period of poor service but the burgers are always good. Their service has been great lately.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oshkosh,,,,,
1,Tiffany B.,"Oshkosh, WI",1,55,,3.0,2017-05-07,"We decided to go back to the Red Robin in Oshkosh and the service was much better. My burger was underdone, but it may have been my own fault for not understanding their cooking process. Some places ""medium"" is a little pink and some is a lot of pink. The next time I ordered well done and it was perfect. Affordable and a fun atmosphere, but loud. I wouldn't go there for a quiet night out, but for a fun, group thing or a casual date, it's perfect. There are a lot of conversation pieces on the walls and upbeat, modern music. For a good burger, it's a good place to go, but if you want the best, I would look for other reviews in a place that isn't a chain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oshkosh,,,,,
3,Carol T.,"Adams, WI",17,5,,1.0,2017-06-24,"The only reason I am giving this a one is because of the manager.  She was the redeeming factor. Our server was Brandon. Now I'm not sure if he was new or just that incompetent at his job but after 52 minutes we still had not gotten our food order. He came to check on and see how things were and WE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE ANY FOOD. We watched every table around us...that all got there after us (we got there right after they  opened) get their drinks refilled, get there food, and their checks. Not impressed, probably will not go back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oshkosh,,,,,
0,Karen T.,"Saint Paul, MN",16,159,264.0,5.0,2017-12-30,"We stopped in for dinner while meeting friends before New Years 2017.  Nate was our server and he was great!  Our drink order was taken right away, and our food was served hot and fresh.  We ordered soup, chili, chopped salads, and 2 sandwiches.  All were great!  Thanks Nate!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oshkosh,,,,,
