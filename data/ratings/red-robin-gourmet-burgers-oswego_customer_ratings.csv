28,Amanda S.,"Saint Charles, IL",124,331,107.0,2.0,2012-01-08,"Times heals all wounds -anonymous So I haven't eaten at a Red Robin for approximately 8 years, which was the first..and last time I ate there.  At the time, I had a burger and fries at the Woodfield location.  While eating, I thought the food was average-- nothing special but I wasn't expecting my socks to be knocked off. Fast forward five hours and I was hurling in my (now ex) bf's yard as soon as I got out of the car.  That being said, I was truly afraid to patronize RR and did not do so until this past Friday night. This review is for the takeout only:  it was not good.  I do give them credit for somewhat complying with my picky order (Avo Cobb salad: no chicken or bacon, dbl egg, romaine lettuce) but that's about all. Avo Cobb salad:  modified as indicated above.  This salad was essentially all lettuce, with a sparse amount of avocado (think two small-ish slices of avocado), a sprinkling of diced tomatoes, a relatively generous portion of chopped egg, and olives...which were just weird.  They didn't really fit in the salad.  It would have been much better had more veggies been added, perhaps some cucumber and onion.  Also, they did not include the bread that was supposed to come with the salad or any salad dressing, which they had specifically asked me about over the phone.  That's inexcusable, regardless of whether or not you (the reader) think I'm a moron for ordering a salad at RR.  Anyhow, it was lettuce overload and almost had a weird chemically taste to it.  Grosssssssss.  So much for trying to eat relatively healthy. My bf ordered two items:  the Burning Love burger (w/ fries) and the Cheeseburger Con Queso.  Of course I didn't try either of these but I did ask him for a full review of said items. Burning Love burger:  not big enough (patty), not spicy enough, the breaded jalapeno slices were soggy, and he didn't even finish it (which is very surprising for this man).  Overall, fail. Cheeseburger Con Queso:  well, when he took it out of the bag, it basically looked like a half filled container of congealed cheese and partially digested beef.  He said the chunks of hamburger were too big, it wasn't flavorful and it was also room temp.  They do give you lots of multicolored chips though. His fries didn't even look appealing.  Usually I'll steal one (or several) fries from him but they just looked limp, undercooked, and tasteless so I didn't even bother.  He agreed and was underwhelmed, remarking ""well, this must be why we never go there""...see, it sucks. Overall, I would have to say I'll never return to a RR.  They don't have a decent healthy veg/pescatarian option, the food was not warm enough when we picked it up (we were on time and still stood at the bar waiting for them to put it together), and why the HELL would we spend $26.89 on this crap when we could get a better value through the Portillos drive thru a couple store fronts down? Fool me once, shame on you..fool me twice, shame on me.  I should have known better, and for that..I grant two stars to RR.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oswego?start=40,2.9200000000000004,2.9200000000000004,2.9200000000000004,2.9200000000000004,2.9200000000000004

After writing red robins directly I relized there food choices for me fell flat they have a vegan burger but no vegan bun and no other vegan choices.

Since I like the Arctic Cod fish and Chips at another Red Robin I thought I'd give them a try at this location. I arrived shortly after 9:15 pm on a Friday and was immediately seated in the bar area. The tall Guinness I ordered was presented with a decent head and it was adequately chilled. My main order came out pretty quickly and was consistent with other franchise locations. The fish was a light golden brown shade and tasted correctly. The bottomless fries were hot and lightly salted.  The dill sauce was cold like it is supposed to be. While I was eating, I observed the dining room.  The area was clean and appropriately lit. The condiments at my location were adequately supplied. The noise level was a touch on the loud side, especially since I was seated under a speaker. The server checked on me several times to ensure any special needs or requests were addressed. Overall, my experience was on par with other RR franchise locations.

It started off great but ended on quite the sour note. Short story waitress visited us three times prior to food, once food arrives we never saw her again. I am giving it two stars because we enjoyed our meals. 2.5 would be a better choice if I could make a half star review.  We got there and ordered drinks. I had the sangria, he had a Sprite. I also ordered a water. We ordered our food and we loved our meals. I had the buzz clucks and Mac and he had a burger. Once we got our food we never saw the waitress again, not even for our check or the bottomless fried that came with my boyfriends meal ... Which he wanted more of!!!! And never got!! I really wanted to order another drink. I stated to use the digital screen to try and figure out how to get more food. I pressed the button to ""call server"" and it was flashing red for a couple minutes, no one came. So I took matters into my own hands. Sure I could have taken the time to figure out how to use the stupid screen but I got so frustrated I decided since I could pay my bill digitally, and since it was the only thing I figure out how to do quickly ... I paid my check and we left. I would have probably ordered two more drinks and dessert if I wasn't so frustrated and didn't feel ignored. She didn't get a worthy tip at all because I was so pissed off... I had a crappy week, this didn't help.  Oddly enough as soon as I scanned my card to pay ... There she was asking us if we needed anything. Too late. Perhaps all of this technology is a really bad idea? I mean I can just pay my bill and not have to wait around for a server to hand me a piece of paper. And no one can try and fix a terrible experience since I am in complete control of when I pay my bill.  Oh I also love that auto tip feature because that was easily adjust down ... Probably would have given her zero tip but I don't think these stupid digital menus are entirely her fault. I hope your corporate office reads this.

On this occasion we ordered the spinach and artichoke dip and a couple of burgers. The chips that come with the dip must be made in house because they were nice and warm and not too salty. The black and blue burger was cooked well and had a good amount of flavor. The chibatta bread it was on was tasty. Sweet potato fries were good as well. Our server was prompt and courteous. The only complaint I had was the food took a little long to come out even though it wasn't very busy. Overall a good experience. Will return.

I suppose I understand that, I also understand that you cannot accommodate everyone no matter what you offer. However, I would think if you offered a special it would include something that was not beef in which there are plenty of other options.

Walking through the bar, there were several couples seated there, so I guess that's where you sit if you're a duo.  Our server was quick and friendly. I had some sort of southwestern salad which was delicious. Pretty large, should've been on a larger plate.

They have many different kinds of burgers on the menu and the gourmet ones range from $10 - $15 and they come with bottomless steak fries. Red Ramen Burger $12 -  The burger was mad decent.  The ramen buns were deliciously crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  You'll have to eat it rather quickly or the bottom bun will get soggy, although it was good that way, too.  It was a little difficult to eat and messy, but I would do it again.  This burger was jammed packed with flavor and yummy grease.  It comes with chili-infused shredded cabbage, carrot, onion and deep fried jalapeno peppers. Berserker X Burger $11 - This was another limited edition burger that comes with Sriracha onion straws, sweet spicy pickles, cheddar on brioche bun.  It was good, nothing fancy. Not Your Father's Ginger Ale Beer $5.49 - This beer is recommended to be served over ice and it was pretty refreshing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oswego,3.68,3.68,3.68,,3.6800000000000006

It literally feels like you've stepped into a daycare center. It doesn't matter which Red Robin you go to. Being from Seattle, I wonder if it's just different here in the Midwest? Anyway- Service and food below par any more. As another person mentioned bottomless fries are suppose to be just that. Don't come out with 10 fries and disappear until you come back with my bill.

We didn't want to drive far, and I wasn't feeling really adventurous about trying something new, so we decided on Red Robin.  It's predictable, yes, but it's also reliable for good, affordable food.  It's a notch above fast food/fast casual, but a notch below the gourmet burger places.   Red Robin tries though.  There is a variety of burgers on the menu to choose from, and my favorites are the Whiskey River BBQ or the Peppercorn burger.  Both are packed with flavor.  Red Robin is also known for their bottomless French fries, and this location isn't as chintzy about the portions as others. The beer list is decent, but definitely in that notch below gourmet category.  You won't find many craft beers at Red Robin, more like Sam Adams or Blue Moon.   I never leave Red Robin with the feeling that I can't wait to come back, but I do leave Red Robin having had a satisfying meal at and affordable price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oswego,3.44,3.44,3.44,,3.4400000000000004

4,Bill N.,"Aurora, IL",282,156,223.0,4.0,2017-01-16,"I have to admit I have a love/like relationship with Red Robin. When they first opened in the area the idea of ""Gourmet Burgers"" was a novelty, and since then there have opened many restaurants offering Gourmet Burgers. Many of the other burger restaurants are more upscale and Red Robin has attempted to up its game too.  Originally Red Robin catered to families with children, their mascot a Red Robin of course and they even had an employee dress in a large Red Robin costume. Since then, they have attempted to appeal to both families with children and adults who just want to enjoy a good burger without exuberant (read screaming) children.  The bar area is now adult only, leaving the rest of the restaurant family friendly.  They have even remodeled the restaurant to give it a more ""almost"" upscale feel to it, losing many of Red Robin's signature trade marks (upside down Psycho Movie picture previously found in all restaurants) along with other familiar photographs and Red Robin related kitsch. It almost works too! What would help to make it work would be tables in the bar that don't wobble, and how about free WiFi like your competition provides! Aside from that, your servers and bartenders are excellent! A shoutout to Adam, who does double duty as both the bartender and server! Their Royalty program is very worthwhile to join. Not only do you get a free burger for your birthday, they send you numerous money saving offers throughout the year. BTW, their burgers are excellent too! For the longest time I've fallen into a rut ordering their Whiskey River Burger or their Big Tavern Burger. I've recently discovered the Southern Charm Burger and have a new favorite. How can I resist candied bacon strips, black angus patty, honey BBQ sauce, light brown sugar glaze, carmelized onions, salt and pepper, xtra sharp cheddar cheese, and mayo if you like.
