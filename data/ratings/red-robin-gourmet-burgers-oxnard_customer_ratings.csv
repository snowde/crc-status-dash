88,M A W.,"Oxnard, CA",0,56,6.0,5.0,2016-09-01,"Came for a Sneak Peak lunch before the official opening this coming Monday. Great looking facility, comfortable seating and atmosphere plus terrific service and food.  The battered broccoli is my new favorite appetizer for sure.

15,Jason S.,"Ventura, CA",118,168,160.0,5.0,2016-09-02,"Went to soft opening today.  Was seated at bar.  The bar here is completely separated by partition to main restaurant. Would t have even noticed all the kiddies in the main dining area if I didn't have to walk thru it to get to restroom.  Good job tho on keeping the kids separate.  Standard issue RR menu. Today i tried the prime rib dip.   .  One of pricier items on menu, but quality is there.  Included Coke slaw and bottomless fries. As usual, I load up on ranch and buzz sauce.  Totally a fatty cheat meal, and great to was down with a Stella.  Only gripe.... The bar seating is awkward with the small aisle behind the seats. Apparently, the design is flawed where all servers coming from kitchen must pass through that aisle. This means if you sit at bar, expect to get your seat bumped at least every few minutes.  Only mention to see if management makes the needed adjustment. I'm guessing they will.  Food 5/5 Service: on par, or better than expected for soft opening. Many trainees.

122,Steffanie G.,"Oxnard, CA",16,2,5.0,5.0,2016-09-02,Came for the sneak peak lunch.  Server Joseph was excellent and very attentive. He recommended the Zombie for a mixed drink and it was awesome . Food was perfect and drinks were wonderfully cold and carbonated. The atmosphere was welcoming and fun.  Was exceptionally happy to find chalk board games available to play.  In addition to the wonderful meal my husband left his phone behind and the staff made a wonderful effort to find it and get it returned. Great team.  Great food. Great environment.

I kept getting bumped, it was tight & crowded but it was fine. Our waitress was Natalie & she was great & also Katrina helped us out after signing up ""rewards"" & we all received a free gift (red robin seasoning) it was pretty cool. I had the whiskey BBQ burger with garlic fries.....it was delicious!  My friends also enjoyed their food. We were very satisfied with the trainees.  Service was great & friendly!

52,Krista W.,"Oxnard, CA",10,5,1.0,3.0,2016-09-03,"Came in for the soft opening today. Looks nice inside. My gripe was the seating. Got stuck at the corner spot of the bar. Employees kept bumping my chair. I wanted to sit next to my husband not elbow to elbow with random people. First off they ran out of onion rings. Second, we never got refills on drinks. My family went the day before and got a free milkshake sent to their table, plus they got their drinks to go.... I got neither of those. My salad was blah, i could have made the same thing at home. After we left a tip i bolted for the door. Ill stick to the red robin in ventura. Also, they gave us a card for a free dessert,milkshake or appetizer. Little did i know it expires the next day!

175,Denise C.,"Oxnard, CA",0,2,,4.0,2016-09-04,"Went to the soft opening, greeted by friendly people and who gave a little talk about what was included. Went to check in, the greeter was very upbeat. Told us it would be about a 15 minute wait then asked if that would be ok. Don't think it should be put that way, what if I said no, it's not ok. Would I have been seated right away? Think she should have said your table will be ready in a few minutes and offer a menu to look at until then. Very busy for the soft opening. Some items on the menu weren't available.  Our server, Nicole was very nice and attentive. Answered any questions we had. Food was very fresh and delicious. A lot of staff around, for opening and training but got congested in the aisle at times. Counted 10 staff standing in the walk way until another employee came along and told them to keep it moving. All in all a good experience. Will be back to this location again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oxnard?start=160,2.768,2.768,2.768,2.768,2.768
174,Kathy L.,"Ventura, CA",8,3,,5.0,2016-09-04,"Had the opportunity to attend the soft opening (complementary beverages and entrees) twice, once on Wednesday and again on Saturday.  Wednesday was perfect.  Service was excellent.  Great job Bryan and Bobby.  You both made sure our every need was met.  Our meals were great.  They were just as I would have expected from other Red Robin locations.  Saturday was a little off, but keeping in mind this was a soft opening, it was interesting to see how the staff and management responded to the alarms and fire department's arrival.  Aliza and Bobby provided great service.  Both have great customer service skills and made an effort to connect with the guests at our table.  The restaurant decor itself is a little more toned down than most Red Robin locations.  The seating is a little close when the restaurant is full.  The outside seating looked inviting--we'll request outside seating when the location officially opens.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oxnard?start=160,2.9960000000000004,2.9960000000000004,2.9960000000000004,2.9960000000000004,2.9960000000000004
79,Wes S.,"Ventura, CA",1351,866,624.0,5.0,2016-09-04,"I'll have to be honest, it's been years since I last visited a Red Robin (Los Cerritos Center), the reason being, I normally like just getting my burgers quick (In N Out, Habit) and be on my way. Thanks to some Ventura County Yelpers, I was made aware that this location was doing a soft opening and was offering complementary meals to train their staff. Reservations (11AM) were made through RR's website (limit of 4 total per party), which connected to Yelp's reservations which made it quick and simple. Upon arrival, we signed in and was given a quick rundown on what we were going to receive. 1 unlimited drink (soda, coffee, iced tea), the entire party was allowed one Prime Rib dip (if anyone chose to have this) per the pamphlet given to us. Per our waitress Jennifer, we were allowed one appetizer or dessert for the table to share, 1 ""Freckled Lemonade"" (guess this is considered a speciatly drink and not a regular one?) and the servers were also allowed to give out one ""premium"" (Red Robin's Finest) per shift, and if a we wanted a milkshake, it depended on availability as they were making them at intervals. Luckily for us, one of the servers walking around with said limited milkshakes was passing by our table and offered us one and we accepted it. Another server was walking around offering bottomless fries, and we accepted that as well. Our group came to a consensus and we decided on an appetizer (instead of dessert) to share. We ordered the NachO.M.G. using the Ziosk ordering system (which is how you order and pay for your meal). Which allowed us to customize our order anyway we want (choose ingredients, addons, etc.). If you own any smart device, this should come second nature, if you don't, you may want to ask your server to show you how to use it. The nachos were good, but something about the chips (texture wise) was not what I'm used to. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't something that I'm familiar with. When it came to ordering our drinks and burgers, we did so through our waitress.  No one else in my party was interested in the Red Robin's Finest, so I decided to order one from there (as we were limited to 1). I ordered the Smoke & Pepper and added a sunny side up egg, and decided to upgrade my fries to Red's Chili Chili Cheese Fries (which has bacon? I'm not complaining about the bacon, but next time, I'll have to ask what comes with a Red's Chili Chili Cheese Fries). The bottom of the burger had a small pool of grease (wasn't drowning, but a good amount) that kind of softened the bottom of the bun, but wasn't a big issue. The thing that threw me off was from the pictures, you can see pickles on the burger, but if you look at the listing of ingredients, pickles isn't listed as an item. Which makes the burger a bit on the salty side (extra-sharp cheddar + bacon + pickles = a lot of sodium). Now if they used a pickle with a more reserved flavor, or even take it off, it would make the flavors mix better and the sodium levels wouldn't be too overwhelming. I also see a Smoke & Pepper ketchup (which I did see on the bottom of the bun, but it didn't have a strong presence). Small side note, the egg was supposed to be ""Sunny side up"", but was given to me ""over easy"" and the yolk was hard, so no yellow ""nectar"" to drape my patty with. Burger was good, just needed the small tweaks and would be something I order all the time. Service was unbelievably incredible (I just hope it stays that way once they open 9/5/16) as our drinks never sat empty for long, fries were flowing like it was going out of style, and they kept checking up on us if everything was satisfactory. The staff overall seemed ready, some more than others (associates with experience assisting in training of the new recruits), but none of them seemed like a ""fish out of water"". The only thing that I would say ""needed work"" was my brother ordered a Long Island and the bar was ""swamped"" and the drink took some time to get to us. Hey, they're learning, so I hope that the bar picks it up when they finally open up. Overall, the food + experience + customer service, I will be back and maybe try a different burger as well. Thank you Jennifer, Red Robin, and staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oxnard?start=20,2.836,2.836,2.836,2.836,2.8360000000000003

First they didn't want to seat us outside because there was ""too many of us"", but really the didn't want to try. 6 of them were just huddled up socializing. Another host actually accommodated us. Waitress had us waiting on our drinks for about 15min when the tables that were seated after us had their beer and icecream ready.. We had asked for waters and sodas.  Came back multiple times after we had ordered to ask what cheese, type of plate, or if we wanted it rare or well done.. Didn't get our sauces for our food, finished our plates before they even came back with bbq sauce or ranch.. Was pretty decent on making sure we kept getting our refills on our drinks, but not our fries.. SAM the manager was awesome. He came to us after and listened to us.

If you like the food and service at the Ventura location then try this one. Oxnard and Ventura red robins are just a pass for me. Then the manager of this store even attacked me as a person to my mother. Also this location states for every food allergy it takes 7 minutes extra (so hypothetically if you have 10 food allergies you will wait 70 minutes for your food) AKA they don't want your business if you want any substitutions to your food.  However, if you love the stellar food and and amazing service of the Thousands Oaks location then stay on the 101 until you make it to the T.O. Red Robin. If you venture out that way ask for Cody he is my favorite waiter but they are all great servers!! The food is even worth the drive because it's right and hot the first time around.

76,Mylinh S.,"Oxnard, CA",49,133,471.0,1.0,2016-09-17,"Our server Rica provided our table with five-star service. This review is for the food quality only, as the host and hostess and the serving staff were exceptional.  The quality of the food we were served belonged to a one-star establishment.  Sombrero salad: lettuce was warm and wilted. It tasted as if it had come from a bag of store bought pre-washed salad that had been left to sit out in the sun all day. We ordered two of these and they came out different from each other, and both were quite pathetic looking. It appeared as if someone in the kitchen had just randomly thrown a bunch of lettuce onto a plate, added a few black beans to it and attempted to decorate this combo with some avocado and a thin slap of chicken breast. Both salads came out without salad dressing, when one had been ordered with and the other without dressing.   The house salads were of similar sad condition: warm and wilted. How anyone could mess up a house salad was beyond me.  The fries were cold and hard.  The burgers were NOT ""gourmet"" as claimed on the menu. The patties were thin and tasted like those frozen patties that you would get from a lazy and simple back yard family BBQ. Whoever had prepped the food couldn't even get the sauces right: the steak sauce on the burgers ended up to be a BBQ sauce.  I had never seen my always-extremely-proper-in-public mother so upset over her food before.  First, she had had to wait close to an hour for her salad.  Then she was served such low quality food. And when she found out that the salad was close to $11, she mumbled angrily under  her breath for the remainder of our visit.  And if I were to transcribe what she had said abut her food, I would have to bleep most of it out. She even left the restaurant early because she felt cheated.  Rica did ask Manager Sandy to see us about our disappointment with the food. Sandy did explain to us about the entire kitchen staff being brand new and that the restaurant was still training its staff. She did remove the Sombrero salads from our bill.  I am going to keep my one-star rating for this establishment because the food was so bad. I will give it another chance in a month or so, and hope that all the kitchen staffing issues will have been worked out by then.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oxnard?start=20,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003,1.7960000000000003

The front staff were terrible. We got there at 740 and were told that it would be 30-35 minute wait. After about 35 minutes we started seeing groups going before us and hadn't waited more than 5-10 minutes. We had a group of 8 two of the groups that came after us had 7. They continued to tell us that we had too large of a group and they were having trouble getting a table ready for us. Well then how were u able to get two groups of 7 before us... After close to an hour we finally decided to leave. When we told the front stuff they proceeded to make a few rude comments towards us. Unfortunately I could not find the manager to file a complaint and was not willing to search any longer for her. It sucks because we go to the Ventura one all the time and like the manager, she would have been very upset to know what her staff was doing. But after an hour of waiting and many groups approximately our size going before us we left and went to lazy dog. I am currently here and they say is right away.

139,Teknowave V.,"Oxnard, CA",0,30,3.0,1.0,2016-09-20,"I waited a couple days to write this review to make sure it wasn't exaggerated due to frustration. The restaurant is clearly still in training mode evidenced by the numerous staff running all over the place. I was given a 20 minute wait at check in and it was on point. My server was courteous and did her job ok considering the staff chaos.  The one star rating is directly related to the quality of food which took about 40-45 minutes to arrive. My wife and sons ordered burgers which all came out just warm like they were sitting for a while. Soggy fries felt old or not cooked properly. Onion rings were not fully cooked and drenched in oil. I ordered a beer a little after sit down but that took about 30 minutes to arrive as well.  Here's the really bad part. We ordered the chicken fingers and fries for our daughter which came out late with the other food. My wife is used to opening/cutting the chicken open to cool down to eating temperature. Upon doing this she noticed the chicken was completely raw. I mean totally pink and uncooked as if it was just taken out of the refrigerator/freezer. I wish I would have taken a photo for this review. We were absolutely shocked and disgusted. My daughter had almost bitten it to that. We all lost our appetite after seeing this. We called our server who apologized, took it back and ordered a replacement. The manager came over and apologized and made the lame excuse of the cook probably putting the food in the wrong fryer? I would have expected more of a concern with seriously raw food being served. Whatever the reason that cook has absolutely no business in the kitchen and should be fired. I hope no one has fallen victim to food poisoning by this place.

We ordered appetizers through the tablet majigger.  It wasn't until after we had received our appetizers that someone was finally cleaning up the table adjacent to us.  But then, we soon realized it was because the bus boy actually was just talking to another employee sitting in the booth behind us (she must have been on break or just getting off work).  He literally half-assed  cleaning up the plates and was just making even more of a mess by spilling half the leftovers onto the floor.  Then, here comes our server Kristy, and helps him out!  She even asked for his rag because he was going to leave the mess on the chairs--instead, she cleaned up the rest of the table for him while he chatted with the nearby female employee! As we waited for our food, another male employee came to talk to the same off-duty employee.  From what he was loudly yelling as he walked away from the employee (we kinda had to stop talking because we couldn't hear ourselves over his yelling), he's trying to hook up with one of her friends or something and he told her to be secretive about it and a good wingman.  Well, okay, good luck bro--I think maybe you should be a little more discreet if you want to keep this a secret! Our food came out good--'twas delish!  Red Robin never lets me down.  Kristy even came to check on us a few times and was so attentive to EVERYONE she was serving!   Then, a different employee comes to sit and talk to the same off-duty employee still sitting in the booth. We also noticed several employees exiting to the side patio to eat, hang out, and take smoke breaks.   The food was great.  Our server was amazing (we were really lucky to get her).  I'm only giving it 3 stars because the people who were supposed to be working kind of ruined the dining experience since it was so noticeable that only our server was working while they lollygagged.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oxnard?start=60,2.2,2.2,2.2,2.2199999999999998,2.2

We ordered 2 classic burgers. One kids cheeseburger with fries and the other cheeseburger with black pepper bacon. Well apparently the kitchen lost our ticket order bc it never came out. We literally sat there for about 30 mins with our appetizers, water and lemonade done when I stopped the server and asked to check the status of our entrees. Took her about 10 minutes to coke back and she looked flustered on the verge of tears and really disappointed. She said there was a mishap in the kitchen and the manager is going to speak with us and offered anything else in the meantime which we denied bc we would not have room for our entree. Manager came out 7 mins after and apologized and said they are remaking our burgers and would comp us our meal. 20 mins later our food arrived. Kids cheeseburger had no cheese and my black pepper bacon cheeseburger had no black pepper bacon. At this point, we didnt want to send it back, so we laughed about it.

It was also really annoying how long it took to get a refill of fries and my soda, since my server was nowhere to be found. The only reason this wasn't 1 star is because the food was fine I guess.

My wife's food came out before everyone else's so she had to wait for us so we can all eat together. I ordered a burger and was asked how I like it, I said slight pink and they served it rare. My son ordered the kids meatballs and they brought it to him last and without the cheese dip, he actually had to wait almost 5min and we had to remind the waitress. My daughter ordered the kids pizza and she got a cold pizza, to go with her cold drink. The bottomless fries are a damn joke, they never come back so you don't get shit anyway. Obviously management needs work cause they have no clue how to run a restaurant. The cooks need help in the kitchen or Red Robin should invest in cooking appliances so the food can actually come out warm.

I assumed there was have been a party going to take all the available tables and so i agreed to climb my hard to miss pregnant bump onto the high seats.  I immediately excused myself to use the restroom but the waiter stopped me on my walk back and asked me what he could get me to drink.

This was ny only issue with the server besides this he was awesome. I ordered a sandwich my husband ordered a burger with things added for extra and no tomato no mayo. He got the upgraded fries. The server checked in with us a few times and was very friendly. He updated us on the timing of the food.  When our order arrived I got what I had ordered my husband got a burger with tomato and a different extra then what he had requested. The fries were also not the upgraded one. The server noticed the fries right away before we even said anything and he brought them to the table. Since we were hungry we decided not to say anything about the burger since I did not want to wait to have it fixed.  When I paided I noted that the server had inputed everything we had ordered correctly however this was clearly an issue in the kitchen and the person who ran the food not checking before delivering it.

We ordered 2 Banzai Burgers ( my favorite). The presentation looked good. But the tomatoes were very pale, and mushy. The burger just didn't taste like we remembered it. I had a side salad with balsamic dressing, and my husband ordered onion rings. The onion rings were very good they were breaded. My salad tasted moldy, I took one bite and left it. The red plastic plates they serve the food on, make it feel cheap. I'd rather have the red basket they used to use.

25,Charlie E.,"Santa Barbara, CA",0,117,,1.0,2017-04-25,"Everything about this visit was a hard NO. We went on a Friday evening around 5:00 because we hadn't eaten that day and were hungry for an early dinner. It was a hot, beautiful afternoon out so we asked to sit outside. This is where everything started to go wrong. We were sent outside to seat ourselves by the hostess who didn't give us any menus.  The waitress who was covering the patio had one table that was nearly finished eating and then us. The patio was empty, otherwise. She brought us silverware but still no menus. She said she'd asked someone else to get them and they hadn't so she'd be back. In the meantime, a family was seated, they had their menus and a guy who seemed like a manager took their order despite walking past us several times. After a while, he stopped by and we asked for menus AGAIN.  At this point it was TWENTY MINUTES since we'd sat down. We had to wait another 10 for the actual menus. WTF.  We would have gone someplace else but we were starving by this point and figured if they got the ball rolling we'd eat faster than if we left.  Finally, after several other weird and awkward visits from different waiters and our original waitress, our order was taken. The family of six had eaten, paid and left before our order arrived. I think we waited an additional 45 minutes on top of the original wait. There was not a large crowd. It was an odd time and maybe they were between shifts, but it was just the worst service.   As for the food, the ice in our water glasses tasted like old fries, so I'm guessing the ice is stored near where they make the fries or with the frozen fries in the freezer. If you manage to mess up ice, you're not doing a good job.  The silverware had food stuck to it and the wine glasses were dirty, too. Almost as dirty as the manager dude's fingernails. Almost.  The food was epically sub-par. Not even mediocre. We are it literally because we were just very hungry.  The best part though was when another waitress with a neck tattoo stopped near our table to reach far down into the back of her jeans to pull her underwear up. Guess who ended up serving us our plates? GROSS. I've been to different Red Robins and I have always felt like they were reliably okay. I figured this would be even better since they just opened fairly recently. This must be a very poorly managed restaurant. We left wondering if we were going to get sick over the weekend from the poor quality of food and the remarkable lack of cleanliness we witnessed.  Leaving a place wondering if you're getting sick in a few hours.....well, that pretty much says volumes, doesn't it?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oxnard?start=40,1.84,2.21,2.21,2.052,2.0620000000000003

166,Don W.,"Camarillo, CA",0,4,,1.0,2017-05-18,"We have been to several Red Robins around So Cal and this one is noticeably bad by comparison. My Banzai burger had almost no sauce on it (usually it's a messy burger). My wife's BLT Croissant had a stale (hard) croissant and they gave her 4 or 5 french fries. My daughter's Margareta had no salt on the rim and tasted non-alcoholic - they probably forgot to include the tequila. We've visited this location before several times and every time something has happened to disappoint us. The dining room is always noisy (they wouldn't let us in the bar this time) and at 6 pm the glare from the windows was awful. The place is always full of screaming children - it's descending to the level of Chuckie Cheese. The service was attentive this time, but in the past we've been treated pretty badly when we've complained about something.

First off this was on a Wednesday night 740pm. We were sat fairly quick maybe 5-8mins. When we sat down we took our time to really choose the right burger that sounded best to both of us. Our sever was great BTW, we were sat in the big room to the right, from the looks of things there was only 2 servers in this area 1 host.  Now for the food, I got the BBQ burger with normal steak fries, the fries looked as if they were on there last life and had no flavor to them. The fries were warm only on the inside which leads me to believe that they were prolly sitting for a while. This was prolly cause the the sever was out running all her own food. My burger was warm but didn't taste fresh at all. I still ate it because I was starving at this point.  Now the second burger and fries was the Mac and Cheese burger with sweet potato fries. My GF went straight for the fries which is what any normal fry lover would do. Fries were completely cold, I mean as if they were sitting in the car on a 30 min drive home cold. Biggest disappoint of the night. After begging my GF to at least take a bite of the burger she did and it was nice and hot and fresh maybe the saver of the night but not enough to ever want to come back. After letting the manager know how we felt he apologized and informed us of a party of 20 in the other room and he was in the kitchen cooking. It sounds to me like the floor management and kitchen personal may have all been let go way to early, our 10.99 burger was comp'd per ""TEEN PARTY"" but our night out was ruined.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oxnard?start=20,2.32,2.17,2.17,2.052,2.23

32,Patrick H.,"Ventura, CA",0,7,,1.0,2017-11-05,"We had a 20 minute wait with half the tables seated and that was consistent for everyone waiting.  The restaurant is under staffed or just has a completely incompetent staff.  Our drinks were served relatively quickly though my coke was flat.  Then it took another 20 minutes for her to take our order and as my drink was empty I was never asked if I wanted a refill.  Our order took another 30 minutes to reach the table.  I ordered a Marco Polo and the presentation was sloppy and very few fries and served Luke warm.  My wife ordered a mushroom burger medium rare and was served a overly well done burger with raw mushrooms.  Over server was very inattentive to our table no bottomless fries, drinks and it was even hard to flag her down to pay the bill.  You know how you feel when you've had it and all you want to do is walk away from the situation, well that is this Red Robin's experience",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oxnard?start=40,2.16,2.19,2.19,,2.1780000000000004

I cut my burger in half and there was a hair connecting each half. They replaced it of course, but then i couldn't eat it because I asked for it without cheese and the waitress didn't tell me that the veggie burger had cheese inside the patty.  I can't eat cheese so I ended up just eating the fries and leaving.

Only 3 other tables had customer yet still took so long. Waitress was okay but not too nice.

It took about 20 minutes for our food to arrive, which we didn't think was normal. There was no one else in the restaurant except for two other tables. My friend said his burger was very average and didn't impress. Our waitress, I think we saw her three times the entire meal. She left halfway through and didn't tell us.

I won't ever step foot in that restaurant ever again. They lost a gem!!!! He was the most hardest working person around and the whole staff loved him. This company is absolutely stupid for letting the best hard working person go. Hope shit hits your asses. The rest of your managers suck shit!!!!!  I will make it very well known so people stop going to this place!!!!  The regionals name is Tony he is a lying cheating piece of crap. Apparently your engaged but like messing with other managers.

I would say 3/4 employees walked past us and our empty drinks... We waited a total of over an hour and didn't get our food. Of course as we are getting up to leave someone wants to make everything all better, while 2 minutes before he overlooked us... Never going back and telling everyone I know to not go here... I never understood how these type of employees can be hired. Clearly they are not in the right industry, dealing with people or providing quality service...

18,Sharon M.,"Camarillo, CA",0,3,,1.0,2017-12-10,Went there on 12-9-17.  There were 8 of us and we waited almost an hr. for our food with several apologies and french fries to appease us.  It was supposed to be a birthday dinner.  When the food finally came my burger was not cooked correctly and was barely warm.  Others had food not warm also.  My granddaughter's food was sent to another table so she and I would have to wait again to have our food reordered.  We both decided to cancel our order because while the wait staff was trying to figure this out most of the rest of the table was finishing their food. In the mean time a table of six next to us left about one half hour after we arrived and another table of six came in and was served their meal and left at the same time as we did. So after 1 1/2 hrs. 2 of us had no dinner.  They said sorry the cooks are really busy and gave us a discount. I will not be going there again on a Sat. and maybe never.  I have had decent service at other Red Robin's and am a loyalty member but this one was a disaster.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oxnard,1.68,2.11,2.11,,1.938

The staff seemed to just be hanging out talking most of the time chatting. The second time took longer to get the food, total time at the restaurant was over 2.5 hours, and when it came out some of it was wrong or inedible, tortilla on wrap was rock hard like it had been under the lamps for too long.

The kids were very excited about the bottomless fries option and were ready to eat lots of them! We were a little disappointed the portion of fries given is very small. So yes they're ""bottomless"" but you get a tiny serving and it's very annoying to keep waiting for the server to get more. The server was very busy with lots of tables so we had to wait a while to get a refill on fries and drinks. The kids enjoyed their burgers, they described them as ""juicy,"" ""flavorful,"" and ""yummy."" I enjoyed the onion soup and vegan burger. The restaurant was extremely busy when we went and that might of been why we received slow service but it could be easily fixed by having more staff on shift during busy times. Our server was very nice but super busy. Over all the food was decent but service can improve.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-oxnard,1.88,2.15,2.15,,2.0420000000000003
