Parking is not easy to find due to this location is in the mall. Ugh... Went inside and it seemed like it was nice sized location. Staff seemed friendly but extremely busy which can be good and bad at the same time. I suppose it depends on if you are in a hurry or not. I ordered a bowl of chili and my husband ordered some type of burger wrapped in lettuce with an extra patty. We didn't order anything extravagant but I wasn't impressed with either. Red Robin is known for their burgers and bottomless fries but I don't see what's so great about their burgers. If I want frozen, not fresh burgers then I would rather eat fast food for a bit cheaper. There seems to be a lot of families that frequent this location. Kids galore so if you are looking for a somewhat quiet burger place then this is not a viable option.

I checked yelp, I kind of forgot about Red Robin being inside the mall but being that I was pretty much right there I walked on over. I arrived at about 1:30 and there were quite a few people inside. I had seen the yelp complaints about wait times, normally that would be of concern to me but I had a couple of hours to kill before I was to meet someone in Lancaster so I entered. I was quickly seated, handed a menu, and my drink order was taken. Along with the main menu there was a one page special menu and on it was a burger called Smoke & Pepper which included Black-Pepper Bacon, Extra-Sharp Cheddar, House-Made Smoke & Pepper Ketchup, and Smoked Sea Salt on a Toasted Ciabatta Bun, this sounded good and I ordered it when the server returned with my drink. I decided to time how long my order took, after reading some of the yelp comments I was expecting a bit of a wait. 6 minutes later the burger was brought to my table, 6 minutes! And this was during the lunch rush! The burger was very good, cooked the way I like with just a hint of pink at the center. The black pepper bacon and smoke and pepper ketchup gave the burger a bit of a kick. I cleaned the plate, I was asked if I wanted more fries but that would have been overdoing it, I know my limits.

First, it's in a mall (not their fault, but I hate malls!). Second, we do takeaway quite a bit since we have small children, and they made mistakes with our order the last two times. It's been the same mistake two times in a row, and my husband said what he wanted three times, but it was still wrong.

124,Chris S.,"Agua Dulce, CA",7,46,1.0,1.0,2015-11-17,"If they had a zero to rate this location, I would use it and they would deserve it.  First, the remodeling is terrible.  What used to be a nice, quaint atmosphere is now open, bright and just odd.  The art work is strange with a bunch of old 8-track tapes arranged in a grid with an ""Uncle Sam"" overlay -- do these two things really make sense mashed up? They had no bacon for their bacon burger and no onion rolls.  The server said that the management was not too sharp and it shows with glee.  The server was fine but the place itself has gone downhill. Also, the new remodel did not leave much room for handicapped people as I saw one go by that had a very hard time maneuvering the narrow byways -- nice to be looking out for the physically challenged Red Robin! Lastly, the silly Ziosk tabletop ""toy"" cost our party an extra $1.99 when someone accidentally hit the wrong button to pay for games for which we did not intend to purchase.  I found it annoying that it was constantly flashing ads in my face as well. I don't go to Red Robin much, but it will now be reduced to zero.

38,Daniel J.,"Pasadena, CA",219,79,814.0,3.0,2015-11-21,"Red Robin is one of my favorite places to eat, and this particular location has always rated between 2 to 5 stars, depending on the day.  My family and I have been here numerous times over the years and we plan to return again, always with the hope of visiting during a 4-star or a 5-star day.     On the best of our visits to this location every aspect of our visit was enjoyable, from the cleanliness of the restaurant to the pleasantness of the staff, and most importantly to the quality of our meals.  When this place is at its best it is very difficult for other restaurants to compare.  The difficulty is, of course, to consistently achieve this rating for every visit.   For the purpose of providing constructive criticism for the management here, and for potential customers, I will now clarify on four of my disappointments over this last year:  (1) My kids' meals have consistently been exceptional, but on some occasions (about one quarter of them) my meals have only been mediocre, from a cold meal to a burger with a noticeably unripe pineapple. (2) The restaurant is usually quite clean, but the bathroom is often less than acceptable.  One example is when I recently entered with my young son and it wreaked of marijuana smoke from a previous visitor.  It was sickening to the point where we had to quickly leave the second we possibly could.  The restrooms also may get visitors from outside the restaurant, outside of the mall, so restrooms should be monitored for cleanliness more frequently than other Red Robin restaurants.   (3) On rare occasions, I have had an unfriendly waitress or hostess.  One example is when the waitress would not make any small talk with me or even make eye contact, and it was unusually awkward, especially in a sit-down restaurant where communication, customer interaction and friendliness are crucial.   I've had this waitress more than once, and had the same experience each time (so it wasn't simply a bad day). But again, this is rare, since all our other waiters and waitresses were totally awesome.   (4) I've always loved the atmosphere at all Red Robin restaurants, but some of the recent changes, at the executive management (national) level, have been rather disappointing.   One example is the recent logo/sign change that was made, from the exciting ""Red Robin"" highlighted above the door in neon lights to the current and boring sign with light-red lettering on a dark-red background.  This was an unwise decision made at the national level, and unfortunately this particular Red Robin location now must conform to this poor decision for consistency.     Once again, I plan to return with my family, with the hope of having a 5-star visit, which I know can occasionally be delivered at this Red Robin.  I can navigate around the one poor waitress.  I'll just try to ignore that dull and boring Red Robin sign out front.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-palmdale?start=20,3.72,3.72,3.72,3.0840000000000005,3.7200000000000006

The manager also acted like she (as a customer) did not matter. I never heard him apologize. He said he could get her seated, but her party had already left due to the situation. I still hadn't been able to put my name in. A guy walked up behind me and met with a waitress (I'm guessing they were friends or family). She put their name in and jumped everyone in line waiting. After I put my name in, I watched the waitress let the host know that she had a table opening and that it was specifically for that party she had put on the list. I don't think this was right. She shouldn't be able to jump the line and get people in faster than the people who had been waiting. The service I saw, before I even got seated, was terrible!

I know salads are not too exciting but when I have gone to other places the salads are good with fresh lettuce and plenty of toppings. This one was some lettuce, little bit of onions on the side a piece of chicken and avocado on the side, don't remember tomatoes, limes or parsley as stated on the description. BBQ sauce and ranch were on the side, usually the dressing is mixed into the salad. The plate was the size of the salad so it was hard to mix all the ingredients together.  After we left I realized they didn't give me the garlic toast as also stated on the description. Cost of this sad salad was $10.49 :(. I buy the BBQ chicken salad from trader joes for $4 and it is much better. No drink refills offered. We also ordered a side of fries no refills offered either. When the waiter came around it seemed like he was in a hurry and briskly walked by while asking how was everything. Sons order was wrong but he said he would just eat it and didn't want me to ask for another since they took a while the first time around. This was during lunch and they were not busy. My other son ordered the chicken strips which came with 3 measly fries on the side.  When I asked for 3 to go boxes you would think he'd know to bring a bag, I mean how I'm suppose to carry 3 boxes along with my shopping bags.

I asked him to talk to manager, because clearly, I have a coupon that was sent to be by Red Robin. The manager, Pedro,  actually said there wasn't anything he could do without my account. Seriously! We're talking about a $4.00 discount. It was pure principal at this point. Your company sent me a coupon, you need to honor it! The waiter was great, and tried helping us.

We received no silverware and had to ask for it AFTER our appetizers and entree came. Then when we paid to leave the server was adamant to have us talk to the manager and would not take no thank you for an answer. She then cursed under her breath and walked away only to turn around and glare at us until we left the establishment. We tried to walk away peacefully and leave peacefully.  After this happened three of us who had literally one bite of the curdled cheese became sick.

The menu items appear to be multiple variations of the same items just put in different places to make it seem like there is more on the menu. The cocktail list is similar and all very unappealing. I have nothing good nor bad to say about the food we ended up ordering, it was honestly forgettable. The restaurant was not very busy yet there appeared to only be one employee actually working. That was our server Bobby who was also tending the bar and almost every occupied table while trhe rest of the employees we saw just walked around. Bobby was extremely polite and personable and hard working and attentive. The service was really the thing that made the experience ok and not a complete disappointment.
