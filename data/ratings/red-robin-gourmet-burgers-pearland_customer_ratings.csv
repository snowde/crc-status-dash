99,Karri L.,"Pearland, TX",0,6,,1.0,2012-08-31,"This experience occurred a few months ago and I haven't been back since. (and I won't return) I have been to many Red Robin locations over the years, not sure about the food here, I became so irritated with the lack of service that I left after I got my drinks. Let me clarify, when I entered the restaurant there was one other couple inside. We were seated and watched 2 more families come in, be seated and served drinks. (the servers all saw us and walked by) after about 20 minutes the hostess came and informed us that she had seated us in a section that didn't have a server assigned (ok no problem) and she needed us to move, 18 INCHES, to the table next to us. After we scooted to the neighboring table a young girl came to take our drink order (water and a Dr Pepper) and got irritated when we wanted to place our food order as well (we had spent plenty of time reviewing the menu) She had to come back 3 times to clarify what drink we were getting because she kept stopping to talk to other employees and would forget. After the third time I told her never mind and she looked shocked. As we were leaving the hostess (who had reseated us 15 minutes prior) said ""hope everything was great"". I informed her that it wasn't and I would not ever return to this location. True to my word I haven't. As far as food quality?

Each time I visit, I order a different burger. They all taste a little similar. Somewhat greasy but packed with flavor. I'm not a huge fan of their fries, I like mine a bit thinner and crispy. The wedges aren't that crispy but always come out piping hot. My boyfriend and I love their strawberry lemonade here and always get one to share since there's free refills! He loves the Royal Red Robin burger because it gets topped off with a fried egg. Overall service was good and the food was good.

The bottomless fries idea is used alot because the amount that comes with your order is small. Overall I was a little disappointed with the ""gourmet burger"" I had and felt like it was over hyped.

It was seriously an overwhelming taste of sodium.  I'm not sure if this location was just having a bad day with salt, or if their food is normally like this. I just don't want to go back to find out.

The server had issues and had to get some help and whoever she talked to said that our loyalty account was just activated today and that they can't apply any discounts. I had their account for probably 5 years and got the email a week prior to the visit. I tried explaining that to them but they would not budge.

I ordered the bacon quac burger and enjoyed it though it definitely could use some more quac, very scarce.

Then every bartender and wait staff simply disappeared. A waiter dropped off our food and once again we were alone. We wanted another drink but could not get anyone to serve us.

The thing is, it's not really the food that's the problem. The food is pretty good, most of the time. I've never had anything I didn't at least like, and most things were pretty good. The specialty burgers I've had each time we've gone there were really good. The bottomless fries are yummy. I love the fried zucchini a lot. We've had the veggie sampler appetizer too, which was good. I love the twisted raspberry drink thingies and the other drink specials. I hate that they serve alcohol, because it just doesn't seem like that type of place to me--I don't know, like, it's this 'family' oriented place, but then there's these bottles of liquor all over the place. Just seems out of place to me. The service isn't horrible, but it's never really been good. We've always had to sit up front and wait a long time before we are seated, even when they aren't super busy. I don't fully understand that. The hostesses who have been there haven't been very friendly or upbeat either. They aren't exactly rude, but they certainly aren't the nicest folks I've met. We've had one good waitress of all the times we've gone--she was fabulous. She brought refills, brought fresh fries, without us asking, and even recommended some good items on the menu. she pointed out specials and everything a good waitress should do. We're big tippers when the service warrants it and we rewarded her for this, most definitely. The problem is, out of all our visits there, she's the only one who really stood out. Since they are so far away from us, and the food is good but nothing amazing, and the service isn't great, we just have finally decided it's best just not to go any more. There are better places to go closer to where we live. That all said, my best friend regularly goes to a different Red Robin and has said the service there is much better. But even though the website says they have low-carb items there, the staff aren't very familiar with the special dietary items the website says they have. So really, I think service is a matter of which store you end up at. It's a shame it's not more consistent across the board. As for accessibility, well... they're okay. When the restaurant is super busy, it's really difficult to maneuver between tables and it's annoying to have to disturb folks who are eating just to try to get my wheelchair by.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pearland?start=20,2.84,2.84,2.84,2.7,2.84

Must have been in the same freezer that they store liquid nitrogen in cause I could not get a spoon through it for about five minutes - way too cold to serve.  I generally go during off times so I can avoid long waits. But even when it is not busy the service is kind of slow. I don't understand why that is, but it is.

As far as the chips, that little funnel looking thins, makes no sense - can't fit much chips in it at all! Ordered (3) gourmet burgers $13+ each, 1 gold margarita & a blue haze. Burgers were smaller than Sonic or Burger King! For that price, I wish I could have gone to Burger King! I know for sure my burger would have been less soggy, and I would have definitely gotten more fries for my money!  Margarita, tasted watered down, and blue haze tasted like ""iced gatorade"".  Needless to say, will not return.  Food is definitely overpriced, for what they serve, (we actually compared burger prices McDonalds has the 2 for $5 - that would have really been way better.  Our drinks were mediocre, and service quickly delivers your bill immediately after they bring food......WOW!.......Red Robin?

Burgers average around $10 but again it's a good size portion with unlimited fries.  Their Red's Tavern Burger with fries is advertised at $6.99 all day every day, so there are options for the price conscious. I've had other things which I like as well, such as the Bruschetta Chicken sandwich and the Clucks and Fries, and they are delicious as well.  So you definitely have options to choose from if you're not necessarily in the mood for burgers but the rest of your friends are.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pearland?start=20,2.8,2.8,2.8,3.024,2.8

The waitress took our drink orders and before we could order appetizers, she took off. Our drinks were served with almost no ice and when I asked for a cup of ice it took forever for her to bring a tiny cup full. We asked what the ""S"" sauce was and she said, ""I don't know"" and just stood and looked at us. We had to ask her to please find out. When our order came one of the burgers was wrong. When we told her, she just looked at us and said, ""okay, what do you want me to do?"". Our tickets were wrong also. One couple ordered water to drink and they had a soda on their ticket. The soda was missing from our ticket. We just gave them the money to cover the soda because we didn't want to deal with our waitress anymore. Obviously they need to train her better.  We ordered the queso with chips as an appetizer as well as the pretzel bites. The queso was very good. It had a nice spicy flavor and the chips were good and crisp. The pretzel bites tasted like they had been dusted with sugar instead of salt. They had a sweet taste instead of a salty taste that you would expect. The cheese sauce on the side was a grainy liquid cheese that looked like it came from a can. Won't be ordering those again.  Hubby had the Marco Pollo chicken sandwich. It's his favorite thing on the menu. The chicken is moist, tender and flavorful. The peppered bacon is a very nice touch.  I had the black and bleu burger which was a huge disappointment. The meat patty was a skinny piece of meat that was way over cooked. The waitress didn't ask how I wanted it cooked, so I guess the kitchen assumed crispy  and well done was the way to go. There was no bleu cheese flavor and it became a soggy mess that I ate with a fork due the liquid from the sautéed onions and mushrooms and because I added all of the bleu cheese sauce trying to make it have a better taste.  The unlimited fries are a great deal. They are thick cut fries and once you add salt to them, they  are pretty good. They offer a choice of sauces with them and the campfire sauce is awesome! I wish they would bottle it and sell it, because I'd buy it.  We will be going back to Red Robin, we just hope the service is better next time.

Not many burger joints offer a Hawaiian/tropical burger like this so it's a nice change of pace. The sweetness of the pineapple and teriyaki contrasts well with the savory burger.

I just re-joined the Red Royalty rewards since on your birthday they give you a free burger... However, it becomes valid 24 hours after you register. So if you are going for your birthday, think ahead and register at least a day or more ahead. We had great service from our server, who was very courteous and proactive. You only have to know one burger- the Royal Red Robin burger with a fried egg on the top. Get that and endless fries, and you will be very satisfied. Also make sure you try their sauces (most of them are add'l cost) but the sweet and spicy ketchup is free. It's pretty good! And make sure you get a freckled strawberry lemonade. Our server split up the mac and cheese and the kid's drinks too. When we asked about it, it was no big deal because the mac is bottomless. Did not know that, but a helpful  tip!

48,Ayanna F.,"Houston, TX",0,3,,1.0,2017-01-31,"I absolutely love burgers and fries and Red Robin has always been my place to go.  This past Sunday my best friend and I went and the experience makes me not want to return.  Our server was NOT attentive at all.  Took forever to get our drinks (maybe bartenders fault) and the drinks tasted like plain fruit juice.  When I asked the server if these were the alcoholic ones he said yes but the drinks here are not really that good (that is what he said).  I informed him I've been many times and the drinks have never been this bad.  So I asked for an additional shot for myself and my friend.  Its sad that the shot was more than half of the cost of the actual drink.  We then placed our order and it took FOREVER for it to come. Others who placed their order after us received their food before we did and our order was nothing special.  Once it finally came (delivered by someone else) the fried egg I asked for was sunny side up.  When I mentioned it to the guy who brought the food he looked at the egg as if he was confused and didn't know the difference.  I said I asked for a fried egg and this one is a sunny side up.  He then said ""oh, you mean over hard"".  Over hard is fried.....  That also took forever as my friend was already on her second half of her burger.  All you have to do is flip the egg over for a few and bam.. you have a fried egg or over hard as the guy stated.  So while the guy stood there waiting for my egg, my fries were getting cold and no I did not receive new fries.  Also it was very clear that we were out of fries once we were almost finish... we were never asked if we wanted more.  You guys do offer bottomless fries correct?  Overall experience is that I do not want to come back and as I stated I have always loved Red Robin.. not so much anymore.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pearland?start=40,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005
2,Trina M.,"Fresno, TX",102,381,58.0,5.0,2017-02-12,My daughter and I decided to stop in yesterday. We had a craving for burgers and one out of a window just wouldn't do. This location is close to the house and at 1pm on Saturday was decently full. No wait for a table though.  My daughter and I picked the same thing - bacon cheeseburger. I had mine wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun and black beans instead of fries as I'm trying to make better choices. O.M.G. that was in the top five of best burgers I've had in life! Wow they slam dunked it on flavor. The service was also spot on. Quirky thing is they have touch screen computers at the table and you can add to your order and pay right there.  Oh and as for better choices.... We also had the donut dessert... It's a tower of their version of the cronut with dipping sauces. Delish!!!! Totally worth trading the bun on the burger.....lol!

10,Jim W.,"Houston, TX",0,4,1.0,1.0,2017-04-14,"What a bitter disappointment. This was my first and last visit to a Red Robin. The burger quality was inferior to that of McDonald's and the portion size for $15 was a crime. I suppose the bottomless fries are supposed to be palliative, but they were parceled in tiny amounts that were smaller than an order of small fries from the afore mentioned Chicago clown. What a rip off!  And Red Robin, shaping a bun into a square does not magically transform it into Ciabatta bread.  How this purveyor of crappy hamburgers stays in business is beyond me. You know it's bad when the Hamburglar rips you off less.  Grimace, where is Mayor McCheese when you need him?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pearland,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96

3,Justin T.,"Pearland, TX",1440,254,894.0,2.0,2017-05-22,"Red Robin usually hits the spot for me when I'm craving a decent burger, but this location continues to disappoint. I've given this location quite a few chances since it is close to home, but our experiences are consistently bad. The restaurant is usually pretty empty, so getting a seat for our big party is no hassle.  What makes me rank this place so low is mainly based on customer service. I'm sure there are great employees there, but we seem to get stuck with the person with the worst attitude. It feels like we are always inconveniencing our waitress. We are pretty chill as customers and don't ask for much, so no need for the sorry service.  Now the food is hit and miss. I've had decent meals here, but more times than none, it was a miss. I ordered the Fiery Ghost Tavern Double. Talk about no flavor whatsoever. It's supposed to be a spicy burger, but it was as bland as it gets. The way they top the burger also makes it completely soggy and it falls apart after the first few bites. I will say the burgers my family got that were on ciabatta buns were pretty good. What I do love about this place is the bottomless steak fries and the freckled lemonade.  Hopefully they step up the customer service and get that place back to being busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pearland,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004

My first experience was horrible about 7 months ago I went in to this location to try their gourmet burgers since I had heard so many great things about them. I walked in and asked to place a to go order and the host pointed me to the bar area. I literally sat at the bar for 15 minutes and not one person spoke to me or asked me if I needed anything. I told myself I would never go again. Yesterday June 2, 2017 my boyfriend and I decided to give them a try since BJ's had a wait time of 25 minutes. We were sat almost immediately and our waitress came in a timely manner. Our waitress ALEXIS was amazing!!! It was my boyfriend and I first time eating at Red Robin.
