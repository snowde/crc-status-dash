I took a sip of the water and noticed it was kind of sweet, there were particles of someting floating in the water just below the ice, looked almost like small pieces of fruit pulp Now for the sandwich, it had the overpowering taste of the melted swiss and the thousand island dressing and not the beef.I gave them a shot and didn't like it.

We are BIG RObin fans and expect nothing but the best so the review is not necessarily of the menu or the food because it is Hands Down Delish!!! The staff on the other hand welll.... this particular Red Robin Does in fact have some pretty great staff , especially Dani! if you can get her as your waitress I promise you, you wont be disappointed.  I was a waitress for years aNd I KNOW what needs to be done . Dani has it. She knows the menu, she can get things done qui ckly and yet she is sweet and humle(so stay that way Dani because thats part of what makes you great! ) It is hard to get great wait staff. a few days later we went back in and were very disappointed. not with the food. but with our waiter.  He was so cocky and you could tell he was looking for a fight. the computer had broken down and he was not happy having to apologise. it was a crazy Saturday so we expected mistakes but what a mess. i felt bad for all of them . I tell you though, it makes such a differe nce if your ATtitude is better because guess who delivered our food? Dani! still smilin and still holdin her own as if nothing was wrong in the restaurant.  I wouldnt havee even noticed it if she had been our waitress. the staff and manAgement seems pretty good over there minus 1 or 2 with attitudes and of course the food is A LWAYS GREAT!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pensacola?start=60,3.604,3.604,3.604,3.604,3.6040000000000005

Shout out! We have had a couple of issues with the female manager. The most prominent being the time I had a defective (?) burger. I took a bite and a half dollar sized piece of plastic fell out of my burger. When I looked under the bun, there was a chunk or meat missing where the plastic was. It wasn't intentional, and don't fault the wait staff for that mishap. The manager did accuse me of placing it there for a free meal and asked if I needed my burger remade.

42,Stephen I.,"Pensacola, FL",0,38,,2.0,2015-01-31,"Had an early dinner date with a gal that ordered the Red Robin Mushroom Burger and Broccoli. She did not eat the bun (Low Carb) and enjoyed her burger and veggie. I had spent 20 minutes reviewing the Nutrition Info on the website. VERY impressive interactive website and data. Unfortunately it took me all that time to try and find anything remotely healthy and containing less than 2,000mg of Sodium or fewer than 80gr of bad Carbs. Ended up with the Grilled Chicken Salad. Awful tasting would be an understatement here. If you have ever bought the bag of frozen and pre grilled chicken breast from Walmart you know how it tastes once thawed out. That's exactly what I got. Way to much sweet relish in the 1,000 Island Dressing. The cook forgot to put basically everything on the salad but the mixed greens so I had a very helpful Manager get the Waiter to deliver my canned and cut up tomatoes in a small dish. The water tasted like it had not been filtered. Nasty. Asked for and received some lemons to help with the taste. My date and I both needed to add the lemon. The waiter shrugged it off as 'Pensacola Water'. Really? How about changing the filters on the ice machine and supply water lines? This was my third visit to this Red Robin and I'm not going back. It just isn't worth it for me to waste my time or money on mediocrity and amateur Culinary performance knowing I make a great Chef Salad right here at home for about $3 with fresh grilled Chicken Breast with EVO and Balsamic Vinegar vs. the sugar laden Vinaigrette they offer. Great Manager...Tina. Good Waiter, David, but needs to pay attention to mistakes the Kitchen makes. They both admitted the Cook failed to make what the menu said. No problem. Warning to ALL Consumers. Red Robin Food has extremely high levels of sodium and bad carbs if you care about what you put in your mouth. Almost all the Burgers approach 1,900mg of Sodium and 80gr of bad carbs if you eat the bun.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pensacola?start=40,3.6,3.6,3.6,3.1760000000000006,3.6000000000000005

I really have nothing negative to say about the meal. The steak fries are really good, crisp and fresh. The smoky peppercorn bacon on the burger was a perfect compliment to the samdwich. I would highly recommend this menu item.  I ate alone and sat at the bar so sometimes the bar staff can get a little hectic and not check on you enough.

My husband had the one with the fried egg on it and loved it so much that he is still talking about it! The service is always great with friendly wait staff that makes frequent stops at your table and always get drink refills in a timely manner no matter how busy they are along with a side show of a gyrating juggling crazy legged table busser that has to be seen to be believed.

Having tried various burgers on the menu and never being disappointed I think my favorite is the one I had today.

We finally decided to try it today. The restaurant is really cute, well decorated, and clean. Host promptly sat us, and was very pleasant. Our waitress was equally pleasant, funny, and gave us plenty of attention. When we arrived at the restaurant, I noticed large graphics of avocados over the kitchen, Yay! I love avocados. So, I ordered the guacamole and salsa with chips, which looks awesome on the menu. What arrived, was not awesome, however. The guac was grayish, the chips were BROWN from over-frying, and had a fishy flavor. The salsa was just okay. We tried to eat them, but were grossed out by how dark and fishy the chips were. There was a weird chunk of something in the guac, I think it was cabbage, can't be sure... We ordered our meals, hubby had a Blue Ribbon burger with the steak fries and I had the California chicken sandwich with broccoli. The burger and the chicken were okay, but we both said we could have gotten the same quality for a third of the price at McDonalds. The fries were also just okay. My steamed broccoli had brown spots throughout....ew. Very disappointing all around.  We were checked on frequently by our waitress, who refilled our drinks as needed.  I didn't finish my sandwich and asked for a box from the manager that had stopped by our table. She brought the box and another for the unfinished chips and guac, which we said we didn't want to bring home because it was....eh. She apologized, and left to get our check, which we had asked for. She removed the appetizer from our bill without our asking, and apologized again, which we appreciated.  Our waitress quickly returned with our completed check, and also apologized for the appetizer, and we were on our way.  Now, you may ask why we didn't send our food back. I never send food back. Too many horror stories about food that's been sent back. I also believe if a chef allows crappy food to be plated the first time, why would the second time be any different? It's true what they say about first impressions, and our first impression was that the food is just not very good, and was created without much care.

If you order an alcoholic beverage the wait to receive it is often quite long. I love the alternative of unlimited broccoli instead of french fries.  Although the lettuce wrap is a great alternative to plain burgers.... the kitchen staff does not understand how to create a wrap.  Instead you just end up with lettuce on top and bottom of the patty.  Very messy to eat.

But this visit (2 Sundays ago) was the best experience, even compared to other brands. Yes, I gave a perfect score. Five stars. FOOD: It came out fast. It came out hot. It came out fresh. It was delicious. Simple as that. I had the Fiery Ghost Style Tavern Double (whew, long name!). Just the right spicy-ness. Although, it wouldn't hurt to add more fire to it. But I like spicy. And I'm always a fan of their bottomless fries. Unlimited steak fries. You can't beat that! My wife loved her food. Honestly, I forgot what she ordered. Since my food was so good. Our 2-yr old daughter loved picking from our fries, as well as the Onion Ring Tower. INSIDE: Clean, well lit, and great energy. I didn't visit the restrooms, so can't comment on that. SERVICE: Our server was phenomenal. He was quick, friendly, always had a smile, attentive, and helpful. He was also on point when it came to refills. He was good w/ clearing whatever was needed from our table on a timely manner. We had no clutter. Enough space for me to rest my lazy elbows. I made sure to tell a manager how great we thought his service was. His name is Dave. In all honesty, we experienced the best service (from any restaurant) from this guy. We realize how all-encompassing, a lot of weight, and huge of a compliment that can be, but we feel like ""whatever is celebrated will be replicated."" We read/see/hear of all things negative, but here's a guy who takes pride in his work. It needs to be brought to light. A manager also stopped by our table to check on us. Wow! Hats off, Red Robin! Be proud of this location! They are on it! Not just in it!  We've always loved Red Robin. My wife and I moved here from SoCal. When we were still dating, we went to a few RRs back in LA.

Those locations were always a positive experience and worthy of 4 Stars.  However, my most recent visit to the Pensacola, Florida location fell short of my previous experiences due to our waitress. The food was great but was diminished by our waitress failing to do her job. She was clearly ""in the weeds"" and whatever was going on in the kitchen was obviously more interesting than catering to our basic needs. The burgers, fries and strawberry lemonade were great, but if it were not for the tenacity of our waitress coworkers, I would probably still be waiting for our food. At one point the manager had to bring out refills on our fries and drinks.

9,Kristina D.,"Navarre, FL",17,87,114.0,1.0,2017-04-26,"Let me explain why my rating is so low. I have been eating at this establishment for 3 years. I work in the mall and it was convenient to order to-go and pick up. Plus they give 10% off for mall employees.  However, over the past three years my food has been unsatisfactory every time. This is not an exaggeration. When I ate meat three years ago, I would order the tavern burger with bottomless fries. Since it was a to go order, sometimes they would give me a whole box full of fries. This is when Red Robin was at its prime. When I became a pescatarian (no land meat)over two years ago, I decided to try their fish sandwich. My bottom bun was completely drenched and inedible. I have also ordered the mac and cheese with the breadcrumbs and grilled cheese. The consistency of these two items is never the same. My grilled cheese has been burnt, my bread has been stale and even cold. Sure, Red Robin will remake any order that is prepared wrong, however when I'm only given a 30 minute break and it takes 20-25 minutes to make a grilled cheese, I end up not being able to eat it once they remake it.  The mac and cheese has been cold and one time I got someone's left over mac and cheese. Red Robin stated that the cook just put it on the plate and then put it in the to-go container, but the flavor was off and there was no bread crumb topping, not to mention the white cheese was absent and there was just a yellow cheese, so I will stick to my gut on their reuse of product. And just yesterday, my coworker ordered the mac and cheese and it was soured. I didn't try it but when she brought it back, even the bartender could smell it's stitch.  So is this worth eating at? No. If a place cannot even get an order right, after failed multiple attempts, it's best I take my $$ elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pensacola,3.68,3.68,3.68,,3.6800000000000006
