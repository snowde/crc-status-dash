The place gets so crowded, that it appears the restaurant is always understaffed and the servers are overworked.  If you want something like mayo or special sauce with your fry's, ask for it way in advance, because nothing comes fast around here. With that being said, the flavored iced teas are yummy here. I favor the pomegranate, my husband likes the peach. The burgers are yuuuummmmm! Always cooked the way I like them (medium rare) and are really tasty. I like the avocado bacon burger ....bunless, wrapped in lettuce. It's like having a side salad :) The bonzai burger and chicken sandwiches are worth trying too. We never get appetizers here, we just ask for a couple of baskets of fries for the 4 of us. Holds us over until the burgers come. I always ask for the campfire sauce. No extra charge and oh so good. Sign up for their rewards card. There are always discounts and free appies....as well as a free birthday burger and buy 9 burgers get the 10th free. Burgers can add up fast with a  big family.

I didn't realize it'd been that long since we were here last but the restaurant went through a remodel...it's really nice. It's almost a little too nice where I feel like it might not be casual enough to bring my kids too.  There was a 30 min wait when we came at 630 on a Saturday, so not completely unexpected. What was unexpected was how long it took to get our appetizer..again 30 mins..it got a little worrisome with two hungry boys. Our server Dynelle was apologetic about the wait and even though we put the kids order in right away, it still took quite awhile.  As for the food, I had the royal red robin and it was a royal mess! The taste of the burger was good but it completely fell apart after two bites and I ate it in pieces. We also had a bowl of chicken tortilla soup and there was hardly any chicken in it. I can handle long waits, taking a long time to fill our order, and the quality of the food but the one thing that really bothered me about our visit tonight was that the arrangement of the dining room made it so difficult for the servers to get through the aisle that twice they almost knocked into our daughter in the highchair on the end. The new big chairs for the long tables took up so much space in the aisle that the servers had a  such a hard time navigating around them when they carrying the big trays.

In case you haven't heard, they are also offering BOTTOMLESS rootbeer floats now.  Soft serve ice cream with barq's rootbeer.  Bottomless, I say!  I'm yet to get through more than one with the meal, but it's worth the $4 price tag in my opinion.

142,Kris C.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,7,,1.0,2014-07-26,"I grew up in Seattle, so I am very familiar with Red Robin restaurants. This location is NOTHING like I know of the Red Robin Brand. If my only experience with Red Robin was this location I would be wondering how they stay in business. I have given this location multiple chances with each experience worse than the last one. I walk in or call each time with an open mind and a hopefulness that things will go well. But food Is wrong, people hang up on you while you're talking or you just sit there without acknowledgement. To be quick I will summarize just the last 4 visits. 1. Dine in- Order wrong. If you have food allergies and you mention it to the server expect them to forget or the kitchen not seem to care... Even though they have a separate offerings like Gluten free buns. 2. Phone in- order wrong. Wife and I wanted a laid back family night so I called in the order. Reiterated the gluten free bun. The order was repeated back to me. Wife picked it up and reiterated the gluten free, the take-out waitress confirmed yes it has the gluten free bun. Got it home and it was not. We had ordered for the family so she didn't really want to empty everything out right there. And the additional charge WAS on the receipt so the waitress at least had it right. 3. Phone in- rude. Decided to try it again.... Called in asked if they still had gluten free buns. They did. Ordered the rest. Waitress said ok. I started asking how long that would be to come get it and how much. About 4 words into it she cut me off, said ok see you in a bit and hung up... Figured she was busy so I didn't bother her again at all... 4. Dine in- ignored. My son and I went bowling today and we decided to get some lunch afterwards. I know, why would I try again, I try to give some benefit of the doubt and figured middle of the afternoon for a late lunch should be fine. We walked in, hostess was nice, seated us quickly didn't look very busy. That's pretty much where the hospitality ended. We sat for little over 10mins without anyone acknowledging us (at this point I wanted to see if anyone would without me waving my hands around like I was waving down the beer guy at a baseball game). A couple came in at this point with their toddler and infant so I decided to see how their service went.... Oh they had their drinks from the bar, water, and drink for the toddler before they even finished getting the car seat with the infant settled in. Needless to say we left at this point and went for some sandwiches across the parking lot. But looks like a few people had some good experiences here. As for the remodel it looks nice but ask for a booth if you go because they cram some of those tables in there. Although I guess it's good if you are interested in what your table neighbors are whispering... On second thought it's so loud you can hardly hear your own table sometimes so it doesn't really matter. Ask for fries ahead of your meal if your hungry. Gotta appreciate the bottomless steak fries. Maybe in a few months I will give it another shot.... I apparently enjoy frustrating myself",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-phoenix?start=140,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.308,3.2800000000000002
118,Wendy A.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,11,,1.0,2014-08-04,"We have been to this restaurant many times and we will not be returning. We went on a Sunday afternoon and there was no crowd, plenty seating was available. The hostess looked less than happy to have to take the time to seat us.  We waited patiently as our server appeared to be doing all the work. We ordered chips and salsa as an appetizer. After some time the server brought some fries while we waited, but the fries looked like they had been under the heating lamp for quite some time. When the chips and salsa arrived, the salsa was frozen.  I ordered a salad with grilled (blackened) chicken - I don't recall the name of the dish, but the picture made it look good. When it arrived, the chicken was done but it looked and tasted like the chicken that is precooked, heated in a bag and placed on the salad.  It was the first time I felt sick leaving this restaurant. Not sick from the food, but sick because we spent over $50 for 2 adults and a kid and no one was remotely satisfied with their dinner.  The service wasn't great, but I believe it was because the server was overwhelmed.

I ordered one of my all-time favorites, the bacon cheeseburger. Everyone's food took quite a long time to cook (such is to be expected), but OMG, it was so worth the wait! It was just what I needed after a long day. Everyone else had an equally outstanding eating experience, and after eating and paying our individual bills, we all took pictures, shared many laughs, and reminisced on the past season.

It was decently busy, but not packed. We were greeted by a young hostess with an attitude who just sat us at a high top in the bar right by the front door without asking if that was ok. I personally hate high tops as they can be uncomfortable for tall people. We went back to ask for a booth as we saw a few available, and she sighed and said that server needed some time before being sat again, we said we would gladly wait. Literally 5 seconds goes by and she grabs menus and told us to follow her. What just happened? She quickly sat us and sauntered herself and her ponytail back to her perch. Jeez.  The server was nice enough but could have been a bit more attentive, but we knew she was busy. We ordered a chicken salad and a burger to split. We were really excited for the steak fries, like anyone right?! Not so much, our fries were the first thing we tried and they were cold and rubbery and as we used to call in the restaurant industry ""DEAD"". We asked for new ones, which we got but they almost seemed undercooked this time, but whatever. We ordered the burger medium, it was a little more on medium-well side which was okay but it was cold on the outside. We cut in half and ate it anyway, we weren't going to turn a quick lunch into a whole afternoon sending everything back. The salad was meh, nothing to take a picture of for the menu if you know what I mean. Some looked like' ABC' salad...probably due to being tossed in the dressing and sitting there awhile.We did, however, get numerous refills on our strawberry lemonade from our server which we probably shouldn't have. That drink is SO sweet and unnatural tasting that it made me crave refills on water instead.  Anywho, I don't normally expect much from family-type-chains but Red Robin used to stand above many of those in my experiences.

The service can also be very hit-or-miss at this location as well.  We have had times in the past when it was busy and the staff were constantly checking our drink levels and making sure that we had everything that we needed.  On this trip, we were there shortly before any lunch rush had occurred but we almost never saw the waitress outside of the initial order and to check on us once before we paid our check.  The staff at the front was available when we first walked in and they were friendly and quick to seat us so there was not a long wait before being able to sit in the locations dining room.

It used to be that the metal container was completely full and the amount in the glass was equal to the metal cup. Now the glass is a goofy shape, clearly much smaller. The metal cup is less than 1/2 full AND it fills the goofy glass. Therefore, they've cut the portion in half and kept the price where it had been. Not cool! Burgers were cooked properly.

Very busy on weekend nights and limited parking so be prepared to walk. Always great food and good service. They are constantly adding Fun and delicious menu items so it's good to try something new each time.  My favorite dish is the chicken bruschetta sandwich. I get it on a ledge wedge to be healthier with a side salad and it's delicious and refreshing. They have bottomless fries which are amazing and hot. I like the regular and sweet potato fries. Ask for a side of campfire sauce to dip it in. It's like a BBQ ranch and sooo addicting!  Red Robin has the best rewards royalty program too. Every 10th burger is free and they are constantly sending me coupons. I don't think we have ever paid full price. Overall the price is right, food is fantastic and good for the entire family.

28,Jennifer L.,"Scottsdale, AZ",60,205,199.0,2.0,2017-01-24,"This review is specifically about the service. The food was good as normal since it is of course a Red Robin. The front hostess was extremely rude and disrespectful. She was talking with us about how many and booth or table. As she gathers the menus and starts to walk, she stops, turns around and answers the phone putting her back to us. She needs to be taught how rude this is. Either ignore the phone or ask the person in the phone to hold and or ask us in line to wait a moment. So rude! Once we got to our table, we sat there for at least 5-8 minutes before the hostess came over and asked if our server had been there yet. After saying no, she offered to get our drinks which we stated water was fine and we asked to put our order in quickly since we were in a rush. She did go and get our server, so high five to her for that. I wish the service would have gotten better. Our server came over, took our order and also confirmed we only wanted water. I don't know where our water came from, but it sure took way to long for just water. Our fries were served and gone, he looked over at our table from the kitchen area at least twice, estimated at least 15 or more minutes before 2 waters arrived at the table. Wow! Who would have thought 2 waters took that long to prepare. If they were waiting for the ice to freeze I could have told them to hold the ice since the entire glass was filled with ice when it arrived. I do give the server a high five for coming back over twice asking to refuel our water. I do though recommend he takes heed and after someone has said nope were fine with water for the 3rd time to stop offering us alcohol. Specially to the 8 month pregnant women. Our table was in the perfect location to be able to see the kitchen and the food get ready. The restaurant was not busy and I thought I saw our food placed on top ready to serve. Our server got a tray ready twice, moved one of our plates once to and from the tray and finally 10 mins later after another server was pulling out plates did he finally get them and bring them to us. Needless to say I was extremely disappointed in the service. We had to ask for to go boxes when our food arrived because the server was not on his game and we didn't have the hour and half that may be use to.

14,Caroline T.,"Phoenix, AZ",64,152,141.0,5.0,2017-02-02,"My adult son, daughter and I decided to eat burgers tonight for dinner. We all three enjoy Red Robin. I ordered the 'shroom gourmet burger with garlic aioli fries. My son ordered the Buzz Mac N' Cheese Tavern Double with loaded chili cheese fries and my daughter ordered the gluten free version of the Keep it Simple Gourmet Burger. The three of us ordered the strawberry lemonade as well. We ordered the Red Robin Gourmet Cheeseburger and fries to take home to my husband and had it brought out near the end of our meal. The restaurant was busy for a Thursday. We were greeted and seated immediately by the friendly hostess. Our waitress was Ashley and she arrived quickly to take our drink order.  She was very good with waiting on us, patient, and she made sure the Keep it Simple Burger that my daughter ordered was returned because she and my daughter noticed it wasn't on a gluten free bun.  My daughter has Celiac Disease, and she cannot have any gluten at all nor food items cross contaminated by gluten. Once the burger came back out she reassured my daughter that it was a new burger entirely on a gluten free bun. Our food was hot, fresh, and delicious. We love the Red Robin Seasoning and the fries. My burger came out with regular fries, so Ashley made sure I received the garlic aioli fries I ordered as well.  My son ate his burger and started on his loaded chili cheese fries. He got full and inquired if my daughter could eat them. Ashley looked it up on her tablet but also asked to make sure back in the kitchen. They were deemed safe for my daughter, so she started eating them too. While there, we used the restroom facilities and the ladies restroom was clean and well-stocked. I like the convenience of paying at the table on the portable electronic devices. It is even more convenient with the suggested tip at the bottom of the check. I chose to take the survey and I wrote about our waitress, Ashley because she was so attentive, and good at recognizing and taking care of the gluten issue, thereby saving my daughter pain and problems.

17,Lindsay N.,"Mesa, AZ",51,23,3.0,1.0,2017-03-06,"To say we had a terrible experience would be an understatement. From the beginning of the experience of being sat, throughout the entire interaction with our server, Grace, to the having to ask another server for assistance, it was horrific.  I arrived before my guest and asked for a table for two from the hostess. Understandably, she offered a small table (strictly for two) along the wall by the kitchen. Knowing that both my guest and I tend to take up more room (between appetizers, drinks, and entrees,) I asked for a four top perhaps. The hostess, whose name I didn't catch, stated ""There's that one,"" and pointed to the table that is directly along the pass way between the kitchen and getting to the back part of the restaurant. Given that my guest and I were going to be talking about sensitive information, I asked to sit at the four top (booth/table combo) along the wall. The hostess then rolled her eyes and said ""I guess."" Well, gee, thanks. Grace, our server, took about 8-10 minutes to come over for my drink order. She had just taken my order when my guest had arrived and ordered a beverage from the bar as well. We ordered our meal (he a cheeseburger, me a Marco Polo, no bun) and asked for some fries up front. This was done, no issues.  About 20 minutes later, our food was brought out, but no silverware. Furthermore, mine came out without bacon and had lettuce instead of the menu-stated arugula. At this time, it wasn't a problem, but Grace NEVER came back to the table to check on us/our food. I had to get up, not only for silverware, but also to ask the bartender to send the manager over  (because my order was wrong, and has now been sitting there for 12 minutes, getting cold) and our server was nowhere to be found. By he time I arrived back to the table, Grace had miraculously appeared and asked 'What do you need?' I explained what was wrong with my dish and she offered another beverage (which I accepted) and took my plate away.  It took ANOTHER 8 minutes for the ""manager"" to come over to inquire about what the issue was (meanwhile, Grace brought back the same chicken and plate.)  I explained that not only was the order brought out incorrectly, but when I brought it to the attention of my server, all she did (or the kitchen) was literally throw some bacon on arugula on it and bring it back out. They didn't remove the lettuce or warm it up, so now I have 20 minute old -and cold- chicken. His response? ""Sorry we don't bring out the lettuce or bacon. You want me to fix it?"" Seriously? No, sir, I want to sit here and starve. You SHOULD have stated ""Let me correct this for you right away, my apologies,"" or something similar, but to not even ATTEMPT at resolving it? Forget it. I'd rather have nothing at this point because of your service, the likelihood it would be made incorrectly, or that I would even be given silverware to eat it with is clearly not going to happen.  I also had to ask for limes (that come standard) with the beverage I ordered. *eye roll* Moreover, Grace TOOK the kiosk so that I couldn't leave a legitimate comment upon checking out, or even check out for that matter (had to wait another ten minutes for her.) I had to ask another server to ask our server to bring it back so that I could ensure she/her manager would receive comments about the visit. [Note: On the 'comments about today's visit' section, I asked to see corresponding Yelp review for details, this is it.] Finally, Mandy, apparently another manager on duty, came by upon check out and inquired how things were and I let her know how terrible they were. Bless her heart, she actually tried to rectify the situation, but I had already been ignored, dismissed, and not fed for over an hour and I was over so I didn't give her much time (apologies.)  Grace and that male ""manager"" (who looked more like the food runner in charge) should be ASHAMED of themselves and their 'ability' to give customer service. I am embarrassed FOR them, and will be sure to let everyone know what level of service to expect here, which is NONE.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-phoenix,2.76,2.99,2.99,,2.8979999999999997
11,Kristin W.,"Phoenix, AZ",169,278,66.0,5.0,2017-03-08,"I grew up with Red Robin (not this location of course) and although many things have changed over the years, I got exactly what I wanted when I came here last Sunday afternoon. Although I am usually not a creature of habit, when it comes to RR, I have two burgers that I order (not at the same time although I wouldn't be opposed), and I always get the honey mustard with my fries. Everything was exactly as I wanted it. A+ for consistency and meeting my expectations. After a nice hike, the craving for a burger kicked in, so we found ourselves outside of Red Robin at 10:30am on Sunday. With a half hour to kill we went to some of the other places in the shopping center and arrived back at the restaurant promptly at 11am. We were seated quickly (there were already people inside seated...we weren't the first through the door) and our hostess was very friendly. Our server, Kristina, was over quickly and took our drink order and was happy to bring us fries. Love the bottomless fries!! The menu has definitely expanded in the last 30 years but the tried and true favorites remain. My two go-to's are the Banzai Burger and the Bleu Ribbon Burger. This trip I had the Bleu Ribbon (no tomato) and it was delicious. Lots of cheese, lots of crispy onion straws. One of the best burgers on the menu. Kristina came by to check on us often and our drinks were refilled when needed. By the time we were getting ready to leave, the restaurant had filled up. I re-signed up for the Royalty program because I guess I never finished my registration the last time I did, we paid our bill, and we were on our way.  The only downside of the visit was that damn machine that sits on the table, but that doesn't warrant deducting any stars since it's not something that can be changed. Maybe I am old fashioned, but I like the interaction with the server....I don't want to push a button to call them over, I don't want to swipe my card at the table, and I really don't want something sitting there to serve as a distraction for my kids or for anyone else who you are trying to enjoy your day with. I get it...we have to keep up with technology and all these advances, blah, blah, blah...well I hate it. *end rant* Chances are we won't find ourselves back at this location, only because it's off Happy Valley and we live nowhere close to there.

Short staffed ok no problem. Restaurants get busy I totally understand that. But if you see the parking lot slammed your better getting out of there & going else where. TRUST me on this! After being seated and it took 27 minutes just to get our drink order in & another 10 minutes of waiting to get them since our server was chatting it up with his buddies. When he finally made his way over we placed our order. My husband is a strict vegetarian and explained that to him ""our server"". He stopped by to tell us our food was being ""plated"" Then headed over to chat with his buddies again. 17 minutes later & waiting almost an total of an hour on food my husband was served a turkey burger after explaining in detail to the server he is a STRICT vegetarian.  Sent the burger back. New burger came with additional flavors since all they did was swap the meat out of the bun replacing it with a veggie burger.. 2nd time it went back. Out again & still wrong. None of the toppings were added or correct & the server had the nerve to say they "" oh well they were there the whole time you just didnt see it"". I have 20/20 vision and There were no toppings on that burger. Schedule yourself an eye exam. Period. 3rd times a charm they say? Final straw here my husbands burger came back with ""hairs"". Not a strand but strands. We'd had it by this point being starving and certainly cranky after waiting so long For food only to deal with this.  l Now that being said they were VERY busy and we expected to wait (thats not the issue). It was the continuous mistakes, the server caring about talking with his friends & ignoring our needs as customers, questioning us on what we ordered when it was their mistake and so on.

I tried to do curbside pickup and called the number when I arrived to be placed on hold for 9 minutes while I waited. Finally, I went inside to get the order and was treated rudely by the staff. They just don't seem to care.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-phoenix,2.56,2.96,2.96,,2.8000000000000003

12,Joshua W.,"Peoria, AZ",0,14,14.0,5.0,2017-11-03,Upon walking up to the door the hostess open the door for me. I was escorted to my seat and had a waitress arrive they are very promptly. My server's name was Jamie she was awesome! I am a real team member so during your birthday month you get one free burger so I chose the wedge burger with campfire sauce and lemon poppyseed sauce. The burger was delicious and my waitress even helped me with the kiosk. And at the end of my meal she offered me a ice cream sundae for my birthday! I spoke with the manager and told her that this was one of the best red Robin visits I've had! Keep it up guys!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-phoenix,2.68,2.96,2.96,,2.8480000000000003

4,Jason J.,"Lakeside, AZ",5,97,14.0,3.0,2017-11-10,"Quality was good and we were seated quickly and our food came promptly. Service was not great. When they brought dipping sauce, she dropped a cup of ranch on the table. Instead of cleaning her mess, she handed us a stack of napkins and walked away. We had to ask several times for drink refills and they finally came just before we paid and left. Doubt we'll be back to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-phoenix,2.72,2.93,2.93,,2.846
9,D Q.,"Flagstaff, AZ",7,190,94.0,4.0,2017-11-22,So glad they still have the Whiskey River bbq chicken burger. Ben my fave for years now. This particular location did a great job the night my family and i visited. Great service. Seemed a bit spendy.

23,Ellen D.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,7,,1.0,2017-11-23,"We've been eating here for years but our last few visits have been horrible.  Our most recent was perhaps the worst experience ever.  The food came out luke warm and the burgers had an odd after taste.  The french fries we received from definitely from the bottom of the barrel - broken tiny pieces that were hard as a rock.  The waitress was obviously overwhelmed and her service showed it, thus we really didn't have a chance to request a hot meal and were stuck with what we received.  We won't be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-phoenix?start=20,2.72,2.9,2.9,,2.8280000000000003
8,Denise G.,"Peoria, AZ",25,13,16.0,3.0,2017-12-08,"I've always loved Red Robin. So I was very surprised when I saw that the location we went to only got three stars. Well we went and now I understand why it got three stars. The food was consistently good, however the wait staff needed some work. They lost our drinks, who does that? Then once we finally placed our order the burgers were hot the fries were cold. The kiosk that they want you to use to check out with didn't work apparently on several of the tables, so we had to wait for our waitress to find the time to come back to us. It wasn't really that busy it was a Thursday night. All in all, food good service not so much. If you go there don't be in a hurry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-phoenix,2.72,2.89,2.89,,2.822
16,Tim L.,"Glendale, AZ",2,27,3.0,1.0,2017-12-12,"One word about this location... AWFUL. Went on Saturday 12/9 and only waited for about five minutes to be sat for a party of six (3 adults and 3 infants). It was not very busy at all. Our server (Gary with the beard) didn't greet us until 20 minutes after being sat. That 5 table section must have been way too much for him. 30 minutes, yes I said 30 MINUTES go by and we still do not have our drinks and there was not one indication that Gary even knew we existed. All we ordered was soda and one draft beer... ONE. Finally he sees me just staring at him. He then blamed the computer system on why he forgot to go grab a soda LOL. The guy was clearly struggling because we watched him do the exact same thing to two other tables next to us, unbelievable. About an HOUR goes by and we finally get our mozzarella sticks and buffalo wings. Ice cold, mozzarella wasn't even melted lol. Then the burgers of course come 46 seconds after the appetizers and shockingly they are ice cold. I've seriously never had worse service than this place. They need to re-evaluate their staff and have higher standards. Scottsdale Red Robin's never have any service issues and as soon as I move close to this one this is what I get. I won't be back, good thing that a Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers just opened up not too far away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-phoenix,2.56,2.86,2.86,,2.74
1,Craig N.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,34,,2.0,2017-12-29,"I really like Red Robin.  I feel it is one of the best places to have a burger. That being said, the last two visits have really lacked in service quality and attention to detail, which is the reason for this review.  On the previous visit, our server appeared to have 'checked out' and seemed to be in her own world, focused more on her cell phone than her tables. Requests went unmet and we were ignored until it was time for the bill (= tip!) The most recent visit was via internet ordering and was scheduled for a specific time 30 minutes from placing the order. I arrived 10 minutes early and waited at a podium that has a sign designating it as the place for pick-ups. 8 minutes later I overheard someone say that they were filling P/U orders in the bar so I made my way into the den of drinkers. After waiting for 5 minutes to be acknowledged, it was very difficult to have a conversation because of the loud noise level (duh!). After waiting another 7 minutes, I was told my order was scheduled 12 minutes earlier (even though my email confirmed the correct pick-up time) and the server said they would remake the order (cost of sales a bit high there maybe?).  If I go back it, will be because of the quality of the food, but absolutely not for the quality of store/employee management.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-phoenix,2.52,2.87,2.87,,2.7300000000000004
0,Jason D.,"Glendale, AZ",4,86,22.0,5.0,2017-12-31,We came in today with the family for our daughters birthday and our server Emilie was the best she made sure our lunch was taken care of.

3,Kayla B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",8,11,2.0,1.0,2018-01-04,"I had left a very nice 5 star review the last time we were here but I have to update my review to a 1 star because this was the worst experience my husband and I have EVER experienced. We were seated just fine and only had to wait five minutes before eating but after we sat down, we had to wait forever for our waitress to get our drink orders or to even come to our table! Once we got our drinks, she took our orders and we thought the night would be changed around since they were busy.  Of course we were wrong. I had ordered sweet potato fries and got steak fries instead. If you haven't been to Red Robin before, they upcharge you $1.49 for those fries!!!!! My husbands burger was still pink even though he requested well done. We waited for our waitress to come back but she NEVER returned!!!!! Yes that's right folks, SHE NEVER CAME BACK! We got tired of waiting and decided to cash out. I can't believe we had to pay for the fries I never got! We won't be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-phoenix,2.64,2.83,2.83,,2.7540000000000004
