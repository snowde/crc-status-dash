41,Daron D.,"Ypsilanti Township, MI",53,379,68.0,5.0,2013-03-25,"I have to be honest, i did not want to give this five stars. Red robin and five stars do not go together at all. Just the name alone is three or four stars, but here are the facts: One of the best happy hours in the Ypsilanti-Ann Arbor area is at red robin ($2 tall drafts, $1.50 well drinks, and 1/2 off all starters, which are all excellent including the wings, which i personally think are a top 5-10 chicken wings in the area and I also think the onion rings here are the best around, like anywhere seriously). The burgers here are pretty good and priced ( i would say the A1 peppercorn, onion onion burger, and tavern are my three personal favorites). The fries here are also good (taken up to another level with the seasoning salt) and bottomless. They also do have free birthday meals when you join there royalty club, and yeah i think red robin is actually consistent all around the board, never had bad service, always great, and yeah all things consider as shockingly as it must be, this is a 5 star place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsfield-township?start=40,3.0280000000000005,3.0280000000000005,3.0280000000000005,3.0280000000000005,3.0280000000000005
21,Annette J.,"Ann Arbor, MI",3093,1398,5037.0,4.0,2013-06-06,"You know what? 4 stars. There, I said it. I couldn't think of one reason I would give it less than 4 other than it's a chain but that's not enough reason to dock a star. Because for a chain this place is pretty darn good. The other night my fella and I were hitting a movie at Rave and wanted a quick bite to eat. He suggested something along Carpenter. I said I remembered Red Robin burgers being pretty good. He said ""let's do it."" So we did.  It was a Friday night so it was fairly packed (also a local graduation night so lots of celebrating families) but we still easily got a table and were in and our in less than an hour which was good for our tight movie schedule. When we stopped in they were having happy hour which meant super cheap beers (nothing fancy or local but $2 for the likes of a Blue Moon) and 1/2 off apps. I was craving some onion rings so we ordered that crazy onion ring tower which we totally cracked up over when it arrived but we still dug into ravenously when it arrived. Fried, greasy, and oh so bad for you but still so good. I also ordered a burger which was juicy and SUPER filling. Although I still kept eating even though I was full since it was pretty tasty! Admittedly on the ranking of fries steak fries usually fall on my lower end of potato-y faves so I'm not crazy about their bottomless fries but they're good if you're into that sort of thing.  Our server was super nice and really prompt (which was great since we were in a hurry). Prices for regular menu items are a little higher than most other chains but the portions are fairly large, the quality is good, and that happy hour is a great deal as well. Before a movie?

46,Nia S.,"Ypsilanti, MI",0,3,,1.0,2013-07-02,"This place used to be really great but the service has declined steadily and I will never go there again. Yesterday I arrived at about 3:00 pm with my sister and her fiance and when we ordered water, she ordered two appetizers: nachos and spinach artichoke dip (both of which are incredibly simple appetizers). I then ordered mac and cheese with salad and my sister and her fiance both ordered soups. These appetizers took literally 15 minutes to come out - they were chips! The server must not have been putting orders in. People were getting their food that came in after us before we got the appetizers. We had told our server that my sister's fiance had to go to work by 4. 3:50 comes and he has to leave, but we still received no other food (which mind you was simple: soups and salad with some mac and cheese that was likely frozen anyway) and our server never checked on us again. I finally had enough and told another server (since ours was nowhere to be found) that we no longer wanted our food. Our server came over, charged us for the appetizers (which was fair because we did eat them), but he was pretty rude about the whole thing and never had his manager rectify it in any way or wonder why a table walked out.  Because this was a slow time of day and everyone else was being served just fine, I really think that a manager should look into it. You've definitely lost my business and I was a regular but this is getting ridiculous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsfield-township?start=40,2.5320000000000005,2.5320000000000005,2.5320000000000005,2.5320000000000005,2.5320000000000005

The gluten free Royal Red Robin Burger is freaking incredible! Now I have to come here all the time to eat it. My mouth is watering right now.  The shakes are good too. They come in a reasonable size and the seasonal flavors are fun.  The fries are amazing about half the time, but sometimes they are over cooked and dry.  Don't sit at the bar because a lot of the time they have a super loud and attention seeking person back there. BUT, do sit IN the bar area because there are no kids allowed in there. I cannot tell you has grateful I am that a restaurant with a kids menu has a no kid section that I can have a nice dinner in.  (Edit 10/14/14 :  They have fixed the bartender problem and there seems to be new management.  The service is very nice lately.  All around a great place to eat.)

All the artwork is interesting to look at, and I usually find something I haven't looked at yet. It's quirky. This review is coming from a vegetarian that had their favorite appetizer (fried jalapeños) taken from the menu. I moved on to greasy onion rings, or sometimes a tiny serving of spinach artichoke dip and oily and thin tortilla chips. Their garden patty is good, but is greasy regardless of the type of burger you get. Honestly, the burgers are good and creative, but I found myself just eating the bottomless fries after taking a few bites. The service here is great, and they have a good rewards program going on. Maybe this place is fine if you have a strong stomach, but I couldn't handle so much oil.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsfield-township?start=20,2.568,2.568,2.568,2.568,2.5680000000000005
38,David K.,"Ann Arbor, MI",10,123,14.0,4.0,2014-03-06,"Love this place, and this location is quite nice. The staff is always friendly. Food prices are decent, and Red Robin Royalty card perks are surprisingly numerous. The food is quite good for a chain sports bar. I especially like the Whiskey River burger, hot  wings, and chips. Oh, and the tavern sauce is fantastic (kind of like Big Mac sauce). Their fries are unlimited, and they taste good, not great. Dessert is forgettable, unfortunately.  Something that really surprised me is that your burger is properly cooked. If you order a medium-well burger or whatever, thats exactly what you'll get. This location has quite a few televisions and they've always been agreeable to change channels to a Red Wings game when I've asked. Most importantly, this place has a great happy hour, which starts from 4 to 6, then 8 til close (so, more accurately, they have two unhappy hours). $2.50 tall domestic beers, cheap well drinks, and $5 appetizers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsfield-township?start=20,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000007
14,Shirley H.,"Moorpark, CA",95,584,600.0,4.0,2014-04-01,"While I was looking around the web for birthday deals, I came across RR's free burger on your birthday. So about two maybe even a week ago, I signed my hubs up online and a week or so later, he received an email with a coupon for a free burger. We were planning on using it on his birthday, which isn't for a few weeks but I noticed on the email that the coupon is good for the whole month..score! So feeling incredibly lazy again, we decided to go there tonight for an early dinner.  My hubs got the Royale burger, which comes with a fried egg (sunny side up or hard up), bacon, tomatoes, ketchup, pickles and onions. And of course that came with a side of bottomless steak fries. He also got the campfire sauce which had a smokey flavor, as well as the tavern, which seemed to have relish inside. Both tasted pretty tasty but if I had to pick one, I would go for the tavern. It reminded me of In & Outs ""secret"" sauce.  I ended up ordering the Ragin Cajun Chicken sandwich, which came with battered fried chicken, pepper jack cheese, lettuce and tomatoes. I was cravin a chicken sandwich for some time now and this definitely hit the spot! The bun was a little bit too big, but the chicken was big enough that it stuck out on both ends.  I really should and need to pay attention to our servers name because he did an awesome job. Again, another anxiety provoking moment for me is when I've taken a bite of my meal and the waiter/waitress comes up to ask how our food is, while my mouth is full. And our waiter was so good and must've been able to tell because he  walked right pass us as we were chompin away.  One thing we realized about the coupon is, the speciality burgers aren't included in the deal. I believe the speciality burgers are the burgers they advertise either at the front of the hostess stand or in the smaller insert menus.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsfield-township,3.4,3.4,3.4,2.8640000000000003,3.4000000000000004

On a final note, I had a friend with alopecia (she had lost all of her hair) who applied to work for a Red Robin and was told that she 'didn't meet the image of the restaurant' to work there.

My husband and I eat here regularly as he is on a stricter diet and likes being able to get his chicken sandwich wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun. However there is one waitress at this place who I absolutely refuse to be sat in her section. We've given her a few chances and one of the last times we were there she spent a good 80% of the time flirting with some guys, I'm not sure if she was working on a better tip but it was annoying at best because she was not coming to check on other tables she had. We had to flag down managers and other staff for refills and even our bill.

Also, our appetizer never came out. The waitress came by and asked if everything was good. We said we were missing something and she had no idea what it was.

But for those special occasions (FREE birthday burger if you're part of their rewards program), I still come back to RR from time to time. This particular location is very good, top notch for service and food quality.  My personal favorite burger is the banzai, though all the burgers are good. Fries decent too. Their free sauces are nice for dipping stuff. I prefer the campfire sauce. ***Almost forgot: I heard from others in my party that the changing table in the women's restroom is too high! My 5-foot tall female party member had trouble changing her baby since the table was so high.

15,C E.,"Ann Arbor Charter Township, MI",0,34,,3.0,2016-04-18,"It's a good place to get a good burger.  I've generally liked the food here and I'm sure I'll be back.  I tried out the ""garlic herb"" fries last time and I was a bit disappointed, though.  It's regular fries with oil splattered on them and an extremely small amount of parsley.  It was honestly laughable.  When I think ""herb fries"" I don't think ""sprinkle a couple parsley leaves on it and call it a day.""  I was expecting a mix of herbs at least.  I would have been happy with just Rosemary.  Or just Oregano.  But just Parsley - kinda gross, in my opinion. Seating has always been immediate and service has been good.  The milkshakes are top-notch.  The burgers are great and even the non-burger options are quite decent.  I've gotten the chicken wraps before and they were good. A bit pricey but overall good.  I like the wide selection of burgers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsfield-township,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006

Walk in and it's fairly empty which I would have guessed to have been the case at the time we went. Our server was prompt with our drink and entree orders and they came out in no time. I had the Whisky River BBQ burger, which was good albeit messy. My mom ordered the Black and Bleu burger that had the caramelized onions and blue cheese with a side of onion rings. She too liked her meal but had complete sticker shock to see the burger was $15! I'm sorry but no burger at RR should be $15. Quality does not justify it. Another issue I had was that when the server dropped off our check she set it the midst of a table full of plates and glasses. She couldn't even bother to help clear off the table.

The service was very friendly and prompt. The food came out super fast!! It was hot and tasty. I thought his burger was a little on the small side but he enjoyed it. The fish & chips were right out of the fryer!! Noise level is on the high side here as the dining room is open as well as music playing on the PA system and TV's spread about. It's a family atmosphere to be sure. A nice visit. I was very satisfied.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsfield-township,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005
5,Melissa C.,"Ypsilanti, MI",37,69,16.0,5.0,2016-08-29,"Excellent food, excellent service. The pricing is kind of intermediary as far as restaurants go. A burger can be $8-13 depending what you get. They have a full bar which is good for draft, but I'm not too fond of the mixed drinks. It depends on who is bartending. I highly recommend the whisky river BBQ line. They offer a burger, chicken wrap, and a salad and they are quite tasty.  We've never walked out of a red robin hungry, in fact, I think usually we have to take half our food home.

1,MaryLiz S.,"Saline, MI",71,548,2260.0,5.0,2016-12-09,"Several steps up above the usual drive through grade burger and fries. Instead of the disappointingly skinny, dry fries like Mickey D is producing these days, RR gives you thick steak fries that you can really sink your teeth into. You can have free refills and take your leftover fries home to warm up in the toaster oven the next day.  RR has a lot of great burgers and even slabs of ribs on Friday and Saturday, but I have a restricted diet now, so I really appreciate that RR can let me build my own burger from the list of ingredients in the menu, and give it to me on a gluten free bun - or better yet, wrap it in lettuce for a built in salad. I can get steamed broccoli. French fries are made in a dedicated fryer so there is much less chance of gluten contamination.  The decor is fun and it doesn't seem to get too loud even when it's busy on the weekends for lunch. The staff people have always been great. I am glad to have this dining option in the Carpenter Road area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-pittsfield-township,3.2,3.2,3.2,,3.2000000000000006

I was hungry and within 100 yards of red Robin, so I decided to try it out. I had not been there in several years so I did not know what to expect.  My mouth was watering while looking at the menu because there were so many tasty sounding choices. And the idea of unlimited fries sounded appealing. The reality was that the burger was average. Too much bun.  The service was poor. And was expensive for what we ordered.

8,A M.,"Ypsilanti, MI",0,45,16.0,3.0,2017-02-23,"Let me just say, I really like Red Robin (yummmmmm). If you've been to one, you've been to them all. That being said, a cook or waiter/waitress having an ""off"" day might lead to you having a not so great experience at a restaurant - ANY restaurant... so I won't let the waitress my husband and I had tonight totally jade my opinion on this one.  I've been here before and had great service, the food I've received has been consistently good (the cajun chicken I had tonight was awesome), and I'll go back. They were a bit slow getting our food out to us and the freckled lemonade was more ""regular"" lemonade than what you'd normally expect, but that's not what I took issue with tonight... I was really disappointed and plain irritated with our waitress.  There was an employee having their birthday dinner in the booth behind ours (no big deal), it seemed like every on-the-clock employee came out to check on their friend every couple of minutes (seems like a great work environment, honestly) BUT... could our waitress have stopped to check on us to see if the food was good (it was) or check on refills during one of her trips to check on her coworker? Nope. She walked right past us and around her station over and over again.  I understand people have bad days and I don't expect, or want, to be babysat when I go out to eat - but this girl seemed to have no problem taking care of someone she knew over other patrons.

My husbands burger was totally bland. He said the only thing he could taste was the cheese and didn't end up even wanting to finish it. My first batch of fries were cold, which they did replace.

It is a chain restaurant so of course you will not get the touch of local food but they are extremely well maintained location to location . I love their beers . The drink selection is superb. In this location you don't have to worry about the parking also as they have plenty of free parking space . You can have as much French fries you want and those fries are my favorite with ranch sauce. If you are a royalty member then you will get a free birthday burger in your birthday month which is awesome.
