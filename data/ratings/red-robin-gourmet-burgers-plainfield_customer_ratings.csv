49,Michael D.,"Romeoville, IL",34,29,13.0,4.0,2012-03-25,"A little research on their fun interactive nutrition info page on there website and I was ready to go with a solid idea of how many carbs I could expect to consume for dinner. More restaurants could take their queues from RR. Very handy. We ended up with a party of 7 for an after school function on a Sunday at about 5:30. I figured we would have trouble getting seated immediately, but I was wrong. We were seated and greeted quickly. Our server Dawn did not bat an eye when we said we would need three separate checks. Score on in RR favor. No problem taking my low carb order either. Food came out relatively quickly. Everything was delicious. They did bring one of our group a chicken sandwich instead of the salad she thought she ordered, but that was fixed quickly and one of the cooks delivered it from the kitchen himself. Matt, the manager made a quick stop at the table and  said to call him if anything was not to our liking. Everything was and everyone enjoyed themselves. The only issue i have ever had with RR is the noise level. The music can be loud and there is always at least one screaming child in the place. The burgers are so good though!

Best burger I have ever had! Super fried onion rings! Broc was our server, and did a great job. It is a family restaurant, so if you want a romantic get-away, this is not it.

5,Angela P.,"Aurora, IL",440,1743,13.0,2.0,2012-10-18,"I'm a fan of the endless fries.  Hot, salty, endless fries - make sure you use some of that special seasoning!  I'm pretty sure it's just seasoned salt though. The burgers are good.  They aren't super greasy.  If you're a Meatheads or Five Guys fan, Red Robin probably isn't your thing. The service is bad though.  Every time we visit, my husband orders a burger & fries and a side salad.  They always forget the side salad.  Every stinking time.  First world problem, I know.  Prices are reasonable for a meal.  But the fountain drinks and lemonades (also endless!) are overpriced.  $4 for a strawberry lemonade?  We usually leave spending almost $40 on burgers and fries for each of us.  I feel like a fool sending that much at Red Robin, knowing I could've gotten a classier meal elsewhere. And there's usually a kid pitching a fit at the next table over.  Great for families, not so great for newlyweds that just want a burger.  I'll keep Red Robin in mind for when I have little brats to tote around and don't want to be embarassed in a restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plainfield?start=20,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44
42,Susan F.,"Romeoville, IL",3,54,,1.0,2012-12-29,"Ok I know I said I wouldn't be going here again, but it has been over 4 years and you would think they got the picture from the bad reviews.  Hubby and I were in the area so we thought lets get a burger. The parking lot was very empty, it was a Thursday night, so that as I always say should have been a clue. There where only a few other couples there when they seated us in the bar area. It seemed fairly quiet.  We ordered the guac, salsa & chips for an appetizer. It came out with the tiniest amount of guac & salsa. My husband who loves salsa, took a couple of bites and was not impressed. I thought it tasted like caned tomatoes, yuck. The guac was so chunky it was basically a chopped up avocado. It came out on some sort of platform that we had trouble seeing and reaching into it. So I just took everything out of the platform and through it on the table. I just can't believe we paid $5 for this. At many restaurants we go to, the all-you-can-eat chips and salsa are free. Waitress never asked how we wanted our burgers cooked, guess you don't get to choose any more. I asked for Provolone and was told later by the manager? that they were out. I ordered the steamed broccoli instead of the fries. It was OK, not as good as TGIFridays. The lettuce that came out on my open burger (which made it nearly impossible to put together) was shredded and tasted very bitter, old. My husband did get the fries and I glanced into his basket to see how many of the all-you-can-eat a total of about 5 fries was in the basket! Waitress never asked if he wanted any more. I usually steal one of his just for the taste, but for went this. The burger was dry and over cooked for my tastes. They never bused any of the tables even after the guests had left. They never picked up any of our dirty dishes when we were through. Then she asked if we wanted dessert and I thought your kidding right. Where would we be placing those dishes and I certainly don't want to eat a dessert with the lingering smells of my dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plainfield?start=40,2.372,2.372,2.372,2.372,2.372

35,Sabrina C.,"Batavia, IL",145,116,708.0,1.0,2013-08-02,"So, we eat here pretty frequently. We were literally one of the first loyalty club members. Kid loves it and I love that I can get a veggie burger. With bacon. With no judgment.  BUT.  Tonight we dined at this location after maybe a month or so. Menu had changed a bit, kid menu revamped, new plates vs flimsy baskets, etc. Seemed like a positive as we watched plate after plate being served, even if the plates seemed a bit small. Presentation says a lot, and the plates coming out looked nice.  And then... Our food arrived. My veggie burger was fine, same as usual - and I know Gardenburgers come frozen but it's worth it to me, so I don't care. My husband's fish and chips, however, were horrible. Like, I tried a bite and I can't get the taste out of my mouth terrible. Overcooked and the fish tasted frozen and smelled like it had been reheated. Overwhelmingly fishy smell (fresh fish, BTW, doesn't smell fishy.) Fortunately (?) the portion size was smaller than usual.  As for my daughter, well - I don't remember her corn dogs ever coming out with Foster Farms stamped all over the stick before. She thought it tasted ""different"" and ate maybe three bites. Total waste. And THEN, if that wasn't enough... they managed to CHANGE THE RANCH. My 5YO, who would bathe in Ranch if given the option, wouldn't even eat it. Husband and I tried it - watery and gross. Like they thinned it with milk and added oregano to cover up the thinned-out taste. Who messes up Ranch?? It didn't taste like this here a month ago. We were here at least once a week. I'm all for positive changes in a restaurant experience, but we didn't experience any positives. It just seems like they got cheap on their customers - without reflecting it in the prices. If I want a reheated frozen corndog, I'll go to Sam's Club. Finally, to add insult to injury - kid asks for a balloon on the way out, the hostess fills it and shoves it towards her hand without even acknowledging her so she could finish her conversation with the other hostess. We get outside, and the half-assed knot on the hastily filled balloon unraveled and the balloon went straight for the sky. We weren't two feet out the door. Talk about a sad kiddo.  This visit was poor enough that we likely won't return. I left one star because - well - Yelp makes me, and because our server (Katie) was great. It wasn't her fault the food (and some of her colleagues) sucked.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plainfield,2.308,2.308,2.308,2.308,2.308

We were one of the first ones in the restaurant and yet our appetizer- chili cheese fries- took forever and then came out 2 minutes before our food. Not sure whose fault that was, our servers or the kitchens. Our server may have been new because she wasn't on her A-game at all. I had to ask for napkins several times, and everything seemed to take extra long even though we were one of 3 tables in the restaurant. Also, our burgers were overcooked. We asked for some pink and they wasn't a trace of pink in either of our burgers.  Also, the prices seem to be going up, but the portions get smaller. And what's the deal with getting rid of Kids cups? The lids for the cups you have now are NOT kid friendly in the least bit.

Food was less than enough for a child.  I had the clams, shrimp and fish.  Asked if I could sub fries for cup of soup...oh yeah no problem!!!  Dawn did not inform me that we are still going to charge.  Cold slaw was gross chopped rough and celery salt and plain mayo.  I added some Malt Vinagar and was able to get it down. The cup of calm chowder was curdled been setting on high heat too long.  3 pieces of clam served in a square bowl so you were not able to finish it unless you put it up to your mouth. 1 glass of tea that was NEVER REFILLED FOR ALMOST $3.00.  Place was packed and it was a nightmare. Ladies room was discusting!!! My husband had calm chowder his same way...oh yeah they don't have crackers just some oily toast thing they called a crouton...it was cold and gross. Entree was fish and chips, 7 fries exactly and 4 small pieces of fish. $41.13 for this crap and no tip because Dawn dumped food ....anything else as she walked away...anything NO REFILL ON TEA.

Gee, butter really?  Later the waitress came over and gave more excuses.  All I really wanted was just butter.  Is that a big request?   Really really bad and the worse part,it wasn't even 6pm so they were not that busy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plainfield,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
17,Shane S.,"Joliet, IL",51,21,2.0,1.0,2016-01-30,"There's nothing ""Gourmet"" about this place, but it IS for the birds.  I had an absolutely horrible experience here tonight. I brought my two young kids in for dinner at about 4:45pm. We were approached by the waiter fairly quickly for drinks, and got them quickly, but it went straight south from there. While placing our food order, he let me give him my kids' orders, but started grabbing the menus and walking away before I even gave him mine. After that it took over 30 minutes to get our food and it was anything but worth the wait. I had ordered two lime-style chicken breasts (forget the name) and a side salad. The chicken was room temperature and cut super thin, and the entire entreee was the size of an appetizer. The kids meals were likewise terrible with cold steamed broccoli and my daughter's pasta main dish was literally only three spoon fulls of food. Normally, in most restaurants, I have to push my kids hard to finish their plates. At this place, they not only finished them but both complained they were still hungry. I told the waiter that we got jipped on the pasta, and he said ""Yeah, I had noticed tgat."" Ummmm, but you served it to us anyway? Lackluster service, terrible wait, cold food, and underwhelming portion sizes. You're MUCH better off at Chilli's across the street, and that's saying a lot because I'm not a huge Chili's fan normally, but this place made Chilli's feel like a 4 star restaurant.

23,Mike O.,"Aurora, IL",17,101,15.0,3.0,2016-07-04,"What makes Red Robin A-OK is the quality of their burgers and sandwiches.  It has been a year since I visited this location, and I was very disappointed.  Again, the quality of my favorite, The Whiskey River BBQ Chicken Sandwich was amazing.  Just as good as I ever tasted at any location.  Now, it comes to my chocolate shake, which has been always been brought to me in a glass, and the remainder in a stainless steel shaker left on the table. Voila!  Not any more. Now the shake comes in this thin cone shaped glass with barely enough chocolate shake to taste,  Not a DROP...NOT A DROP RICH AND CREAMY.  There is a hint of a chocolate shake there mired in whipped cream and sprinkles.  I do remember the waitress telling me that for a dollar more I could have the extra.  Previously, what was in the glass alone was substantial, rich and creamy ice cream.   Additionally, our waitress did not tell us that there would be a cost for substitutions to my fries and my better halves' fruit.  $ 1.49 extra for mine and .49 for her fruit.  Ticky tacky.  I usually tip 20%, so I gave her 15% instead.   I'll probably come back, the burgers and sandwiches are that good.  But no shakes.  There's more creaminess in a small Mickey D's shake than that ""froo froo"" shake here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plainfield,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68

Lighting still kind of dim, and the Ziosk tablet kiosks still need to die, but staffing levels were better, service and speed were great, and the food order was correct!  Didn't need to ask for more bottomless fries or refills as service and fry portion size were notably improved.
