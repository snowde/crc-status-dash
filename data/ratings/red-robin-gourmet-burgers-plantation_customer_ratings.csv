98,Darlene T.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",103,70,183.0,4.0,2014-04-22,"I've been waiting to try there burgers and I'm so happy that they opened a location close to home!  Let me just start off by saying that I'm truly pissed a t myself for not taking a picture before I had my burger.  It looked so good and I was starving that it totally slipped my mind!  Boo me...will add a pic the next time I stop in & I will definitely be back.  Let me start off by saying that the restaurant was clean and the table set up was relaxing and comfortable where you are not stacked up on top of each other.  Even though the ambience is casual, it could also be a place to have a lunch or dinner date. My waitress (think her name was Jaylene) was pleasant and nice and so helpful when I couldn't decide which burger to order.   Upon the server's suggestion, I decided to order the Prime Chophouse minus the cheese and it was delicious!  The burger was moist and juicy and the horseradish flavor on the mushrooms was just enough to give it a kick without it being too spicy.  The crunchy onions inside was also a good, giving the burger a nice crunch with each bite.   For my side, I ordered the garlic fries (minus the cheese)  which was flavorful and had the right amount of garlic making it not too overpowering.   Overall, I would give Red Robin a 5 but I need to minus half a star because the server should have reminded me that if I wanted to order the garlic fries instead of the regular fries, there would be an upcharge of  $0.99.  I did see it on the menu, but a reminder from the server at time of ordering is better than seeing it on the check at the end of the meal.  The other half star minus would have to go to the burger being cooked well done.  I asked for it to be cooked medium with a little pink, but when I cut into it, the burger was fully cooked.  I didn't ask them to redo the burger because even though it was a bit overcooked for my preference, it was still moist and juicy...that, I can forgive them for.  I will definitely be back for another visit with pics!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plantation?start=80,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997
75,Ian R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1,69,8.0,4.0,2014-04-27,"As someone who's been to Red Robin multiple times in Maryland I'm a huge fan. The Banzai Burger is far and away my favorite burger (even as someone who's been to Charm City multiple times). I was excited that one opened up near me. I'll start my review by stating that I ordered to go as opposed to eating in. This is the only reason why my review is 4 as opposed to 5 stars. I called them asking if I could order take out and was told I'd be transferred to the bar. After 10-15 minutes on hold I hung up and tried again, only to be told that the only way I could get to go was if I walked in and ordered it. That's fine, but I wish I hadn't been put on hold for so long for nothing. That's where my issues with my experience here end. I went to the bar and proceeded to place my order. I can be kind of picky so I order my burger with a lot of customizations which I was concerned would be an issue for a new staff, especially someone who was a bartender-first. She nailed everything down pat though, and my burger came exactly as I ordered. I had multiple staff members come up to me while I was waiting for my food ask me if I had already been helped. They were very nice and concerned which I was appreciative of. I'm normally not a huge fan of their fries (outside of the fact that you get unlimited of them) but these were well more seasoned and crispier than what I normally have when out of town. The burger was right on point how I remember, the teriyaki sauce on the burger patty was great like usual. The place looked nice too. Much more adult oriented and less cheesy than the one I've been to up north. I look forward to returning here soon and seeing how the dine in experience compares.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plantation?start=60,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997,2.6079999999999997

The food was just adequate:  stale rolls,  bearable fries, tasteless burgers. No reason to return.  Lots of better choices.  You can get hamburgers anywhere.

Our waitress forgot our appetizer despite being reminded of it.  At least they had enough decency to take it off the bill rather than bring out later while you are already finished with your main meal.  You definitely want to eat here during the week and avoid the weekends because it becomes overcrowded and the service declines as a result.  We ate here during the week and the service was outstanding.

First we are greeted by the manager who seemed nice, he sat us and said our server would be with us shortly. After sitting for 15-20 mins we still never saw a sever(mind you we went on a wed night and there was only about 25-30 people dining at the time). We saw all of the servers as the all passed our table with none of them even acknowledging our existence. Finally we ask for the manager and tell him the situation he grabs a server (Gary) who proceeds to tell us how this isn't his section and points out his tables that he does serve.  At this point our ""server"" is just going on and on about how he doesn't know who has this section.   Needless to say we gave up on this location and will not return at all.

It was more or less what you would expect from a typical casual style restaurant chain, offering bottomless beverages, such as Strawberry Lemonade. Decent cocktails like the Strawberry Lemon Vojito. Appetizers including some really good, spicy wings and chips known as the Bar Wings 'n' Yukon Chips. And the usual dessert options, such as the Gooey Chocolate Brownie Cake (that sounded good, but was served cold so it really wasn't). However, the burgers were much better than I had expected. They were in fact, as gourmet as they claimed to be. There are various option (buns, toppings, etc). Best of all, if you are not enticed by the menu options, you could always make it your own.

I love the decor (retro old school) and the service (been 3 times so far) has been quite good as in better than expected. Friendly server, attentive, no issues at all. I will also say I'm pretty low maintenance when dining out. So far tried the burgers, fish sandwich, their fries, shakes and crispy onion rings OMG! It's alot to share. The only thing I did not like was being seated around families with small children and then feeling as if I have to yell to talk to my friends. In the future I will ask for a quieter area around no kids. Other than that, I loved it. Great place to go to for a quick bite kind of like a TGI Fridays feel. It's really close to the new movie theater so that's even better. Update 6/2015: After visiting many times since it's opened I'd like to say the food is consistently good. The service can be great, just OK or pretty bad depending on your server. I've had some amazing attentive servers in the past but today I had someone who was absolutely awful. Had to ask for silverware, napkins, mustard & my shake took Forever! I'll still go back though because this does not happen often but if it does happen to you, give them another shot.

You would think that the place would take more pride in in their actual food especially given that there is a burger scene down here and competition is fierce, but i guess when you are just banking on people needing to eat at the mall, then Red Robin is what you get.

We arrived around 3pm so the lunch rush was over and it was relatively empty. They appeared to be understaffed as we waited a few minutes to be acknowledged but that's because the hostess was bussing a table, seating a party before us and taking their drink order??? We were sat and waited a few minutes, which was fine but I wished someone brought water immediately- it's freakin' hot outside!  But during that time, we perused the menu and I immediately was drawn to the bottomless rootbeer float. My bf and his son opted for an Oreo cookie shake and a banana shake.  Of course I sampled theirs. I preferred the banana one over the Oreo but both were super thick and creamy.  I got a cup of clam chowder to start along with a turkey burger and added pepper jack cheese.  It had a lot of spice with the cheese, chipotle aioli, and well seasoned turkey patty. But let's talk about the ""cup"" of soup.  Really more like a thimble. A pretty, square thimble but within 2-3 spoonfuls it was gone and when the check came for the said ""cup"" it was $3.29- seriously?!?! My bf liked his Southern Charm Burger and his son liked his that was topped with a fried egg.  If you didn't want regular steak fries you could select something else. They both had sweet potato fries, which were good- I got onion rings which were better! When the check came, I thought $60 was a little high for 3 people at a casual restaurant but then again we all had a shake and ""upgraded"" our fries to something else at $1.49 a pop, it adds up but the glaring overcharge was the soup.  I was kicking myself for ordering it but lesson learned.  However,  I did have a second rootbeer float and took it to go so it balanced out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plantation?start=60,2.76,2.76,2.76,2.544,2.76

When she finally came to greet us, she told us she would have to go find us a table. Funny, because we saw about 10 right in the front. What she then did was go and talk to the bartender some more. She came back to seat us and sat us in the OPPOSITE direction from where she came from ""looking for a table"". Nice, she apparently thinks we are blind and dumb. We sat down and the server was right there, asking us for our drinks. Our order of an iced tea and coke took 10 minutes to bring. We put in our order: a burnin love and a bbq burger, along with a side salad with vinaigrette. 15 min later the side salad came out....with ranch. The server dropped it off and left so fast that I didnt get to ask for the vinaigrette, so I ate the salad with a small amount of the ranch. The food came about 15 minutes after I finished my sad little salad (which apparently cost an extra $4.49 for a handful of lettuce with a sprinkle of cheese and tomato). The food was hot, but it wasn't anything that I would be dying to eat again. The server checked on us 2 more times and dropped off an iced tea to go, for which I was grateful for.

John is very friendly and super attentive.  I went from giving this place a 2 star to a 5 star because of John.  I'm very big on customer service and he is perfect. The food is always great there in my opinion it's the service that's the problem. If you want great food and even better service make sure John is your waiter.  My fiancé drinks a lot of coke so when we got there he told them to keep the cokes coming. Instead of waiting for my fiancé to keep asking for refills John brought him a pitcher of coke! He made sure that we got everything in a timely matter, it our food was okay, if we needed anything.  I'll definitely will be back to dine there on the days John is there!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plantation?start=40,2.8,2.8,2.8,2.356,2.8

58,Shermekia D.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",158,11,3.0,3.0,2016-03-05,"This place have the most horrible customer service that I cannot even begin to describe. We took my little cousin here for his birthday because he love burgers and this is not a birthday party that he will remember. It was a group of about 14 family members and they gave us one waitress that miss orders, placed food in front of incorrect people in addition to having  an attitude when I asked her to correct things. It took them about two hours to bring the food out some of the family members got soooo frustrated they walked out. They still failed to feed two of the kids. Ask for the manager at least 4 to 5 times the manager was avoiding our table all night therefore I personally walked in the back of the restaurant where they serve the food and waited until I saw the manager. When he came out I approach him and I said sir we have been requesting you all night to take care of our table what is going on? I told him everything that had happened he never once apologize his response was we normally do not take parties this big. I said that is fine, when we entered your facility you should have advised us and we would have taken our money elsewhere. He was like of course not We can't turn you away. I said well if you can't turn us away and you want to do business at least give us the proper service you see us coming in with birthday balloons and gift bags obviously were celebrating something. At that time I was so frustrated with him I asked for the corporate number. He said OK where are you guys tickets, he gave everyone a couple dollars off their meal which I did not think it addressed any of the issues and then stated this is not my store I am the manager for Pembroke pines so if you're down there stop in and will take good care of you. Basically saying he doesn't give a shit about this store or the customers. I'm just here for one night however if you come down to my store to help build my gross margins will take great care of you. This was the worst experience I have ever had in the restaurant if I could I would give it zero stars.  so I wanted to provide an update to my review after writing this review red Robin contacting me in regards to the horrible experience I had at the restaurant. And offered me a redo of my experience. Today me and my kids went to red Robin and they started off on the wrong foot immediately providing me with same waitress from the first experience I immediately requested a replacement waitress. Once the new waitress came to our table she was welcoming and very friendly. She took our orders in the food came out exactly as we ordered it. The one thing that I would have liked her to come and check up on a table to ensure that we had refills with our food. The manager came by twice to just check on us to make sure we was OK which is a complete turnaround from the first experience where I had to request a manager five times. Overall the second experience was not bad but I still cannot give this company a five star rating because of the horrible first experience that will forever stay with me but I do respect the company for reaching out to me to try to make things right thank you red Robin!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plantation?start=40,2.64,2.64,2.64,2.0920000000000005,2.64
46,Renee M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",2,15,2.0,1.0,2016-03-19,"Where  do I begin?  We went in on a Sunday night to have dinner and they were only fairly busy. We were seated at a two top in the middle of the floor way in the back where it's very dark near the entrance into the kitchen. The location of the table was horrible and I was in the path of the wait staff trying to go in and out of the kitchen constantly I felt the breeze of the people on my back every time they were passing by with trays of food.  We asked to be moved, but were never accommodated.  We ordered burgers and fries and when it arrived, we asked for ketchup and were brought one tiny little Ramekin. I also asked for mayo and I was told that they do not have regular mayonnaise but she would go back there and see what she could do. Really? A burger place that doesn't have mayonnaise? Surely I can't be the only one that eats a burger without mayonnaise. and those bottomless fries?  Yes great.... After you eat the 6 or 7 that they bring you, you have to ask for more, that is, if you can find her, and ask her to bring you more, which we eventually did, with an eye-roll and then she took about 10 minutes to bring us a small batch of some more to share.  So much for bottomless. So much for getting any more ketchup. as for my mayonnaise, she finally emerged with one Ramekin of ""gourmet"" mayonnaise in which she promptly told me there would be a $0.50 charge for it because it's not a regular menu item.  I was apalled, but of course we took it even though I was halfway through my burger at that point.  Drinks refilled once and that was toward the end of the meal. It's very dark, brighter lights are desperately needed.   The wait staff needs to be trained on how to serve more people quicker. In the end, she presented the check and then all of a sudden had loads of time to stand there and robotically recite to us the whole spiel about how to join their frequent diner program and how to go online and register. By that time we were so over the whole place we weren't interested but there was nothing we could do to shut her up. We let her finish and left her materials on the table we paid the bill and left.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plantation?start=40,2.64,2.64,2.64,1.8280000000000003,2.64

20,Chris S.,"North Lauderdale, FL",113,120,445.0,2.0,2016-03-28,"Updated review (10/19/2016): Following my previous review, I was contacted by customer service and they offered me a $25.00 gift certificate. This past weekend (10/15/2016) we were in the neighborhood and since we had the gift card, we decided to give this place another shot for an early lunch before our 1:30 movie. Upon arrival, we were seated promptly, at one of the tables in the bar/lounge area. Our server Lisa was also the bartender, and she did a great job of making us feel welcome. The service experience during this visit was 180 degrees different from our last visit, in a positive way.  Unfortunately, in other ways things didn't go well. One of the items we were interested was the Asian burger on a Ramen Bun - which was on the menu, but apparently sold out and not available any more. This put an immediate damper on our spirits, why wouldn't they note on the menu or better yet, change out the menu, rather than get our hopes up? There was a notation on the menu that this was a limited time item, but it was pretty disappointing. I ordered the Fiery Ghost Tavern Double, which came out missing key ingredients (they left off the fried jalapenos for crying out loud.) She got the Nacho Crunch tavern double - which was missing the cheese sauce, so at this point they're 0/3 with us this visit in the food department. Our server and the manager jumped right on correcting the issues, we got cheese sauce for the Nacho Crunch, as well as some fried jalapenos delivered almost immediately upon request, and manager showed up and offered me a replacement burger. All of this took a bit more time than we'd anticipated but the replacement burger was tasty. To reiterate, our server Lisa, and the manager did a fantastic job. The service was all anyone could ask for. Once the kitchen's mistakes had been rectified, we felt that the food was ""ok"", and while we were happy with the service ultimately the experience did not live up to our expectations. Not sure if this is due to the mall location and the somewhat captive audience this represents or if this is a thing with this chain. Overall, we have decided that there are too many places that we'd rather spend our money to return here. Original rating stands as-is. ******* Quick Review: Food good but not amazing (and over-priced). Service lackluster to poor, just barely better than cafeteria ambiance. Rated two stars because the food was adequate. We arrived and found the host stand deserted. An employee who was just arriving came in the front door and ignored us for a minute before realizing that no host was coming to seat us. She never acknowledged us, but to her credit she did find someone to help us.  On the way to the table, our hostess had to change plans three times, because the restaurant was a shambles of uncleaned and unbussed tables. We ended up at a poorly-lit two top in the back adjacent to the kitchen...and the restrooms. We were left with the assurance that our server would be with us shortly - but five minutes passed without so much as eye contact from any of the staff before we saw anyone, and that was the woman who seated us. She apologized for the delay and took our beverage order - and promptly brought us the drinks. After another five minute wait, our server finally arrived. It was at this point that I realized we had problems... the table next to ours was leaving because they'd been sat and ignored. Our server left us to get the manager to speak with them and then when she reappeared she proceeded to show she had no idea how to do her job. Luckily I am a 10 year+ front of the house veteran of the service industry and managed to gently prompt her into taking our order, because she was clearly unprepared for such a complex task as taking an order for two hamburgers and french fries. For our starter, we ordered the Voodoo Fries, which sounded interesting. Fries, queso, blackening seasoning, fried jalapenos, bacon and ghost pepper sauce. These arrived after a 10 minute wait and, while a little light on flavor and heat, they weren't bad; the portion was smallish for the price, but it was enough for two. Our entrees, when they arrived, were tasty, though both burgers were over-cooked. The rest of our visit was without major incident, and we left in relatively good spirits, if dissatisfied.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plantation?start=20,2.52,2.52,2.52,2.056,2.52
19,Kristina R.,"Beaverton, OR",2,18,6.0,3.0,2016-04-24,"Ordered a to go order. One item was a side caesar salad. We checked the order before leaving and luckily we did because it was a grilled caesar salad. They said they would fix it so we waited (we also had a 3 piece tender and a crispy chicken salad). Wait about 5-7 mins and get the caesar salad, it was just lettuce and some cheese with dressing, no croutons or anything. This was definitely not worth the $5.79 that we were charged for the grilled salad. Not sure how much a side caesar costs but comparing it to a side house salad we paid $1 more and no one offered to adjust the price if it is indeed cheaper than the grilled salad (which I think it should be since it was literally just lettuce and some cheese with dressing). Not worth almost $6 at all.  When I asked if it came with any croutons they said they would bring us some of the little breads to put on the salad so we waited again. This time waited about 5 mins and nothing yet so we left. Didn't want the other food to get cold and after being there for 10 mins we felt like we could've just saved time and gotten better quality food dining in.  Also I don't know when Red Robin changed the tenders that come with the kids meals but they are NOT up to the same quality as the ones that come with the adult meals. These tasted like frozen reheated ones I could buy from Costco. Not crispy and the meat inside had hard parts that I had to spit out while I was eating. Like rubbery parts of chicken. The tenders on the main menu taste much better and it used to be the kids tenders were just a smaller quantity of the main menu ones, not a completely different, lower quality tasting tenders. I go to red robin a lot (normally always dine in) and this to go ordering experience was very disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plantation,2.56,2.56,2.56,2.1239999999999997,2.56

It was suggested to me to try the strawberry lemonade because it is so tasty. Needless to say, our waitress could not keep up with my refills   I ordered a spicy southwest salad which came a cut of chicken and a lot of avocado (my favorite). No complaints there, but we were with my girlfriends sister who is allergic to almost everything under the sun. She specifically ordered a chicken sandwich with no cheese and the waitress/cooks got it wrong so they had to remake it. There were six of us at the table and five of us finished our meals before she received her new chicken sandwich. It was a little aggregating that one simple request could not be fulfilled. We flagged down the manager and he didn't charge us for her meal which was generous, but at the same time I now know why there were only a handful of people in the restaurant at dinner time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plantation?start=60,2.24,2.24,2.24,2.12,2.24
16,Alyssa K.,"Fort Myers, FL",383,471,35.0,2.0,2016-05-26,"I've been to Red Robins in the past, and as a whole I've been satisfied with the chain. My parents were in town and were craving some of the strawberry lemonade and big juicy burgers, so they decided to go here after a quick Google search. Even after being here for 4+ years and having gone to the Broward mall a million times, I was unaware that this location even existed. When we drove up on a Sunday afternoon/evening, the location was eerily empty. Been to some red robins where you have to wait 30 to 40 minutes for a table in the middle of the day. We were seated towards the back, right near the kitchen door. Our server came out in a few minutes to take our drink order, which went down without too much hassle.  My sister has quite a bit of food allergies, so it took her several minutes of inspecting the food menu before deciding what she could eat. She decided on chicken sandwich without cheese and several other ingredients and the sauces on the side. The rest of us ordered some burgers and some salads. We were promised ""bottomless fries"" with the orders-not a bad gimmick. She needed it since her order came out exactly the way it came off the menu.  Bottomless fries came in handy for her, as she insisted that the rest of us eat to avoid having her food get cold. Our meals weren't too impressive, my ""Avo-Cobb-O"" salad had a really weak amount of avocado on it. I put more avocado than that on a turkey sandwich. We had all finished (and we aren't animals that eat insanely fast) before my dad got fed up. A manager happened to be walking by at a pristine moment asking how we were doing tonight, to which the answer was ""my daughter still hadn't gotten her food after 40 minutes, and we are all finished"".  The manager immediately tried to remedy the situation, comping the sandwich and then it was delivered to the table in under 90 seconds. This tells me that the kitchen staff is REALLY resting on their laurels that even the refire wasn't out to the table quickly, but as soon as the pressure was on from management it was immediate. The place had nobody in it to warrant the amount of time it took, or the fact that it was messed up to begin with seeing as the tickets were either entered incorrectly or made wrong. We didn't shaft the tip of the waitress seeing as it likely wasn't her fault and it was fixed, but overall it was really irritating and I see now why the place is dead on a day which should be one of the highest grossing days.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plantation,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.088,2.12

So, we waited......and waited.  By the next time I looked at my watch, we had been there for 45 min. and still no food.  I was just getting ready to leave when she wandered by and said it would be right out.  It was only a couple of minutes more.  Then there was the issue of no silverware.  We had to turn on our flashing light again.  She said she'd be right back.  She wasn't.  After another 5 min. or so, my daughter went over to the bar and asked them for silverware.  It took a couple of min., but she got back with it before our server ever did. I decided to branch out and try something different, so I ordered the Banzai burger.  It was supposed to have grilled pineapple and teriyaki sauce.  The pineapple has no signs of being grilled.  It was like they had taken a cold slice out of the can and slapped in on my burger.  There was no hint of teriyaki sauce.  I considered trying to flag her down and have her bring some sauce, but I didn't want to be there until closing. My husband ordered the wings with the buzzard ""sauce.""  I put quotations around that because there was nothing in the way of sauce on the wings.  They had been coated with something and fried, but were completely dry.  They had about a teaspoon of bleu cheese sprinkled on the top, but that was it.  I thought wings were always served with dipping sauce, but they weren't here.  He only ate a few of them, and they used to be his ""go to"" order at RR.  My daughter ordered the ramen burger, but didn't really like the ramen ""bun"" because the noodles weren't seasoned. Overall, it was just a really disappointing night, which is too bad.  When this chain does what they're supposed to do, they can make some very good food.  I think it's going to be a very long time, if ever, before we go back.....at least to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plantation?start=20,2.12,2.12,2.12,2.056,2.12

The manager helped us out with information and drinks and took our order and he was amazing. I wish I could have gotten his name. The waitress assigned to our table must have had something better to do - and she must have wanted to go home on time. Maybe we were in her way, dunno. But we had to remind her to refill our drinks, she didn't even introduce herself by name and we hardly saw her around to get her attention about the missing ketchup or anything else we might want. When we ordered our third round of lemonade (it was REALLY good!) she said ""Did you want that in to-go cups?"" and I said ""no, I'm gonna continue eating his fries thanks. I just needed something to wash it down."" She assumed we were leaving. At that point, her tip was sliding as far as we were concerned. I would have RATHER tipped the manager.

The server was so horrible and inattentive that the manager on duty had to fill in and serve us. The server in question (John or Jon) did not have other tables to serve as we were the only ones in his area, but he did not let that stop him from taking our requests for drinks or fries and then proceeding to speak to the bartender instead of doing his job. A member of my party asked for silverware 4 times and didn't receive them until after he had already given up in his pursuit and decided to simply not eat his food and take the now cold hamburger home.

After the fries I was pretty full,  but I was  still able to try the turkey burger, prezzle bites, and fish and chips.  All of the food was pretty good.  The pretzels came with a cheese dipping sauce that was excellent.  The fish was also a good portion and had actually large pieces of fish as opposed to some places that have a ton of breading but not a lot of fish.  Overall,  everything was good except the service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plantation,2.36,2.36,2.36,2.2199999999999998,2.36

15,Steve D.,"Miami, FL",15,110,3.0,1.0,2016-11-27,"So this review is less about the half-raw chicken as it is about the manager not doing what she said she was going to do. Ordered the fried chicken sandwich.  Order comes out and I cut the sandwich in half.  I see raw chicken.  Not all of it, but most of it.  (see picture posted here). So I tell the manager and she apologizes and asked what she can get me.  I order just a regular cheese burger because I didn't want chicken anymore and figured it'd be quick to cook.  So a short time later the same manager delivers my cheeseburger and tells me its on her for the inconvenience.  Of course I thank her and told her she didn't have to do that.  Well turns out she didn't!!  Someone else in our party got the check and after paying I asked to see the bill.  While they didn't charge me for the sandwich I sent back, they did charge me for the cheeseburger. I'm not one of those that expects a comped meal because a restaurant screws up, but at the same time if you're going to tell a customer you're doing that you should follow through and stand by your word.  Since I'mreviewing, I have to say service wasn't all that great.  When they delivered the food the first time I asked for ketchup and salt.  The waitress (Jax?) said ""give me a sec"" and promptly went to another table and checked with them on how they were doing.  While I didn't expect her to run straight back to the kitchen when I asked about it, I never did get it (much less in a ""sec"").  When the manager came to pick up my raw chicken sandwich I told her again that I needed ketchep for my frieds (that I was going to have to eat while I waited on my cheeseburger).  But it turns out you have to ask three times because it wasn't until they brought my cheesburger and fresh fries that I again asked the waitress for the ketchep and she comes back like thirty seconds later with ketchep.  Never did get the salt.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plantation,2.32,2.32,2.32,2.116,2.32

The time it took to sit us when there were plenty available tables was slow. The server never introduced himself and never mentioned the endless fry option that we also heard about. Our burgers were dry, the buns were flat and the meat was not cooked medium as requested. It was more well done. These burgers were no different than that of BK. The fries and beer gave it 2 stars.

It could have a lot of potential, but for whatever reason doesn't exceed expectations. We began with mozz sticks. They are typical mozz sticks. Nicely fried compared to other places and not overly breaded. My boyfriend ordered the grilled cheese. It came out good, but wasn't all the way toasted/fried. We are particular about this since we don't like soggy bread or sandwiches in any way. He got fries with his sandwich, they were good. I ordered the Whiskey River BBQ burger. It was average. Without an extra BBQ to dip it in, it doesn't taste much like BBQ. I did like their shoestring onion rings. All you can eat broccoli on the side. We sat in the bar area. There wasn't many others seated in the area and no one sitting at the bar, so we got great attention from our server/bartender.

We got sat immediately and the waitress took our order and then comes back 10 mins later and says the computer crashed and needs our order again.  But she wrote it down when she took it! So the four of us repeated our orders. I ordered the Cobb salad with no cheese, dressing on the side.  I repeated that I really didn't want cheese. About half and hour later, they brought out our meals. And my salad had a giant pile of cheese. I called the waitress over and explained that I ordered it with no cheese. She apologies and takes the salad away. Two minutes later, she's brings back a salad that's got a huge section missing. They removed the section with the cheese and gave me the same salad back. Too bad, there was still crumbs in it. I asked her to take it back. As I was no longer looking forward to eating it.  The burgers the guys ordered came with ""bottomless"" fries.

Everyone was very pleasant! Even as we were walked to our seats we were smiled at and greeted by every employee we passed. The manager came by and asked how everything was. He was nice. The food was very good. I had the Whiskey burger and my boyfriend got the hot one with the jalapeño on top. We got the onion right appetizer - which was huge and tasty. We got the stick truffles for dessert which weren't bad but not so out of this world that I would get them again. They're promoting an ice cream cake that looks yummy.  The decor was really cool! Lots of interesting framed posters and such. The restaurant had a decent amount of people in it but it wasn't overly loud. Overall it was a really nice experience.

I thought that perhaps my three year hiatus was unwarranted... BUT then they proved me wrong. I'm sorry, this place just stinks.  I think that any restaurant that wants to have ""Gourmet Burgers"" in their name should be able to cook a burger rare.  You want a rare burger here, you are an SOL.   Our waitress was actually bitchy. She got attitude about being asked anything.  I'm sorry, but when you pay $2.99 for an unsweet tea and want artificial sweeteners, THEY SHOULD BRING IT and not have to be asked THREE TIMES! The manager did stop by and apologized when we told her about the service issue.  She took ten dollars off the check. It was a nice gesture.

My father in law talks about this place all the time so we had to see why he enjoys it so much.  It's kind of similar to a TGIF with a large dining area and bar area. This location also has outdoor seating. Both times we sat at the bar and received awesome service. They offer happy hour all day with $5 beers and wine and my fave $5.50 margaritas. They are great margaritas.  They are known for their burgers but they offer so much more. Salads, soups, pasta, chicken, salmon, veggie burgers, wraps, appetizers and more. Oh and shakes! You don't have to eat unhealthy as they have nice healthy options as well. My first visit I had a grilled chicken sandwich that was delicious.  All of their sandwiches come with unlimited steak fries. Ohhhhh very dangerous they are so addicting. Then they have sauces to choose from either for your sandwich or fries. I get the garlic aioli dipping sauce for my fries and it's wonderful.  The wedge salad is so good.  I finally tried a cheeseburger with provolone cheese. You can create your own or they offer many signature burgers. The burger was cooked to a medium and very tasty. It was not the best burger I have ever tasted but I had no complaints I enjoyed it.  They have many sides to choose from so you don't have to eat the addicting fries. Veggies, onion rings, Cole slaw, etc...

My bf literally had the same. The burger was quite fresh and refreshing. The best part of the night was defintely my waitress Kim. So very kind and attentive. Kim didn't hesitate to get insight on what I usually like and or prefer so she could make some fun recommendations. She was sure to alert me of the rewards card the company offers and the goodies I could get with the card. As I took my pictures I mentioned to Kim it was for yelp and boy that struck up a fun conversation.
