51,Jeff S.,"Minneapolis, MN",8,6,,2.0,2012-01-14,"Shortly after walking into this place, it was very apparent we were in the suburbs.  There were kids, balloons and ""happy birthday"" songs aplenty.  This wasn't unexpected.  We did find a couple of surprises, including an open kitchen and a full service bar.  The kitchen added a little modern touch but the bar wasn't inviting enough to make us want to have a few drinks and watch a game.   There were many different variations of burgers to choose from as well as many chicken, sandwich, salad and entree choices.  There were two us and we weren't very hungry so we ordered the jalapeno coins and a cheeseburger and shared both.  The jalapeno coins were pretty basic, similar to the sliced jalapenos from a jar with some additional breading added to them.  They were deep fried and served with a side of ranch.  They were spicy and surprisingly tasty.  The cheeseburger was a slight step up from a fast food joint and for $9 we expected more.  It came with steak cut fries that were good.  Although they were unlimited, we didn't order a second serving.  It seems as though the burger quality takes a hit because of the option to have unlimited fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plymouth-2?start=40,2.7280000000000006,2.7280000000000006,2.7280000000000006,2.7280000000000006,2.728000000000001
48,Mike S.,"Minneapolis, MN",26,80,,4.0,2012-02-22,"Typically I do not like writing reviews for chain restaurants.  I don't know, something about it just screams 'generic' or 'been there and done that'.  But I have patronized this Red Robin so many times, with the most recent trip being yesterday, I thought I'd drop a line about them. My coworkers and I always find Red Robin a great decision when we're jonesing for a lunch so big we want to take naps under our desks afterward.  Whether we dine in or carry out, we always seem to gorge ourselves silly.  I've probably had every burger/sandwich on the menu and have never been disappointed.  My favorite at the moment has got to be the blackened chicken sando.  It's got a spicy kick to it that is strangely addicting.  They also have a bbq mayonnaise that is so good that if they put it in a glass I would drink it.  It's heavenly to dip the huge french fries in.  Oh, and did I mention the fries are 'all you can eat'?  Yeah, that's right.  ALL YOU CAN EAT.  Ugh...I just can't stop...   The service is usually pretty good.  Although you will notice a definite lull during the lunch hour for obvious reasons.  There has been a few instances where our stay has breached well over an hour.  So don't be surprised if you find yourself waiting for a table during the peak meal times.   Why does Red Robin have to be so close to my place of work?  Seriously.  Yum.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plymouth-2?start=40,2.9280000000000004,2.9280000000000004,2.9280000000000004,2.9280000000000004,2.928000000000001

However, I am rarely, if ever, disappointed with this Red Robin. The changing menu items, wide variety, great service, rewards program, and unlimited fries are just a few of the reasons to frequent Red Robin. I uploaded serval photos of the various burgers Ive tried--cant say Ive ever had a bad one. My only complaint is that they discontinue a lot of the outstanding varieties (such as the Mount Olympus or Blackened Bayou).  I once had a minor complaint and I was sent a letter of apology along with a gift card--their customer service both in-store and from the corporate level is outstanding.

I've liked almost every burger I've gotten, my favorite probably the banzai burger with pineapple on it. Unlimited fries are a bonus, but with the huge burger, you often don't eat them all anyway. Love their bottomless strawberry lemonade. I normally don't get drinks at restaurants besides water, but I will splurge on this one and refill it many times.  If you become a reward card member, you can get free things, most importantly a free burger during the month of your birthday. Been there a LOT for my birthday and I love it. Sometimes they throw in a free ice cream sundae too, depending on how big of a party you're having there.  If I remember correctly, you can get in and out within an hour.

I would fire Tyron on the spot.

Come on! Don't bullshit me! You took 30 minutes to get me chips and salsa. I don't believe you. In fact I overheard the manager questioning our waiter about our order.

First the burgers are pretty good here, they aren't my all time favorite but still very tasty. The fries are indeed endless so go ahead and chow as much as you want but it's nothing that will blow you away. The fries are always there since it's endless so you find yourself eating a lot of them which can fill you up if you are not careful. One of my favorite things about Red Robin is the Strawberry lemonade. They fill the glass with real strawberries which I haven't seen anywhere else. They also have shakes and malts which isn't always the easiest to find so I'll usually mix it up each time I go between a shake or strawberry lemonade.

My significant other ordered a burger with a broccoli side, asked for a side salad, and raw onion instead of cooked for her burger. I had a burger and fries, that's it.  Mine was fine, a little overdone.  She never got her salad, got an overdone burger, and no raw onions.  She asked for the raw onions again, guy said he'd go get some, never happened.  Luckily on our bill, he didn't charge us the extras we ordered, but it was pretty terrible.

Ordered our food and drinks. Chit-chatted a bit. We somehow got the 'it's been a while feeling'. Sure enough it was 8:30pm. Waitress  came by shortly with half our orders and apologized for the wait. The rest of the food came out shortly after. My burger and my sister-in-law's burger were luke-warm and the buns were cold. I usually don't complain, but this wasn't right. $12 burgers shouldn't be luke-warm with cold bread.  P.s. I apologized to my waitress, gave her a good tip still because she wasn't at fault and still gave us good service.

23,Heidi G.,"Minneapolis, MN",144,86,258.0,2.0,2015-11-06,"Went with my coworkers on a Thursday. There were 8 in our party, we didn't call ahead - our mistake. We waited a half hour for a table. Got seated and waited another 10 minutes to see a server. We had a little table kiosk and we thought we could just bypass that wait and use the ""ziosk"" to order drinks.... but it was broken. Server got our drink order finally (5 sodas, 1 lemonade, 2 milkshakes). 10 min later he came back with 4 sodas, 1 lemonade, 1 milkshake. Said he was going back for the rest. Then forgot about us. We had to flag him down to get the rest. And then we saw someone blending the missing milkshake a few minutes later, so it hadn't even been started yet. We finally got him to come back with that stuff and then to take the order and the food took longer than we'd anticipated. 1 of us didn't get the sauce that was ordered with the fries, only 4 out of 5 of the soda drinkers was ever offered a refill despite sitting there with an empty glass. 1 of the burgers was cold. We asked for napkins, those never came, one of us got up to just go them some himself. And when we were done, we needed one to-go box for an unfinished meal and he never came back with that either, so we had to get that ourselves. Overall - just not a good experience. Update #1: I posted this review the day of our visit. I heard from someone at Red Robin 10 days later who said that someone from the restaurant would be in touch. It's now been 3 months and we haven't heard from anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plymouth-2?start=20,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56

22,Dawn C.,"Plymouth, MN",2,17,,1.0,2016-07-22,"Worst dining experience I've had in a long time.  Which means a lot since my husband & I always give a place three chances.  Not this time. First of all the place is filthy. We should have gotten up and left.  Tired & hungry creates poor decision making skills.  Looks like the table was cleaned off with a greasy rag & having the waitress suggest the kids grab the community chalk & chalkboards to play with before eating made me cringe. I don't even want to know where they'd been.  Not to mention the window blinds were broken & layered in dust. The waitress spilled my Freckled Lemonade every time she brought a refill to the table & never apologized.  Brought our meals and dropped my plate sending fries to the floor, again without an apology.  As other reviewers have noted their bottomless fries are a joke.  The whole time we ate she refilled our bottomless fries once with a tiny handle full  for the table. They serve them piecemeal. My husbands Black & Bleu burger was pathetic- it is supposed to be so loaded with Bleu cheese you need to eat it with a knife & fork - right on the menu.  Instead when he picked up the top bun it had two small lumps smeared across the meat.  I asked the waitress for more Bleu cheese & she brought back a small dipping container with Bleu cheese salad dressing.  My children normally love fish but wouldn't eat the fried cod - said it tasted funny.  I suspect the oil needed to be changed or they were frying with something that shouldn't be mingling.  My crab cake burger was mushy & visually unappealing- they have an awesome food stylist for their menu photos but need a lesson in plating a meal.  Then we get our bill and there are six drink charges - there were four of us.  When we pointed it out the waitress tried telling us it was because my husband changed drinks during the meal, which he had not.  The manager had come by & asked us if we wanted refills, I told my husband he never asked what we were drinking before he walked away & I bet they bring back the wrong drinks.  She did, but we didn't think anything of it since they're all on the bottomless menu at the same price.  My husband never likes to complain about food or service at restaurants because he's always worried about retaliation, so he left a good tip & review.  I wish he hadn't because then how do places like this know they need to work on improving their service & product?  Needless to say I'd recommend steering clear of this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plymouth-2?start=20,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6
