Burgers and fries are done right.  Servers are friendly.  This is a good stop for people visiting the Plymouth area. The do some promotions on burgers from time to time.  I like trying new variations of burgers, but try the Teriyaki burger.  That is a good choice.

35,John M.,"Plympton, MA",14,100,2.0,3.0,2012-07-30,"What a disaster nearly every time we go here. It's local and we've been here probably a dozen times in two years. I would say that we have had a major problem three quarters of the time varying from food quality to service. My son loves it so it keeps us coming back, but both Mrs M. and I agree this place is a real crapshoot.  The second to last visit we watched our food sit in the window for about 15 minutes and everything was dried out. We asked to speak to the manager and he was quick to comp us three meals on our next visit.  Well we recently had that free visit and I have to say that everything was pretty good so maybe there is hope...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plymouth?start=20,1.9640000000000002,1.9640000000000002,1.9640000000000002,1.9640000000000002,1.9640000000000002
32,Scott N.,"Fall River, MA",22,51,7.0,1.0,2012-09-19,"So, I don't give out 1 stars often. Hardly ever, in fact. It's hard for me to find the bad points of a restaurant, mainly because most of the places that I go are just that great! I also try not to review chain restaurants, as they're all mostly the same fare, the differences lie in service. In this case though, neither could be excused. I went here with my girlfriend, just 2 people, and the place was pretty much empty. There were a couple smaller parties around us that had been there for a while, and the table we were sat at was dirty, no silverware, and we didn't see our waitress for 4 or 5 minutes after getting seated. Not too big of a deal, this stuff happens. We had gone around 11:30, so they hadn't been open for too too long prior to our arrival. After the waitress arrived, we just ordered some waters, and she came back with the silverware without our prompt, probably the reason this is even getting 1 star; the waitress did everything she could this visit to make it at least enjoyable. We knew exactly what we wanted: She wanted a Caesar Salad with the dressing on the side, and I wanted the Bleu Ribbon Burger with no onions or tomato, and a separate side of fries for both of us to pick at. It took probably about half an hour for the food to be made, maybe 45 minutes at most, and during this time we never saw the waitress for refills of the water, which we quickly downed in our wait. The food finally came out, and it was wrong. She had received a garden salad with Cesar dressing on the side, and I had tomatoes on my burger. We got the waitresses attention, and she had said ""I assumed you wanted a garden salad with Cesar dressing on the side, because the Cesar salads come pre made."" She just sat there stunned and told the waitress no, she just wants romaine lettuce, with cheese, and dressing on the side. 15 minutes later, the waitress came back with exactly what she had ordered the first time. There were only 5 fries in the basket, which were quickly scarfed down. The meal finished, and something we always do is try to make things better by cleaning off our plates and stacking them. As we were doing so, we took the paper off of one of the baskets, only to find moldy food; batter from an onion ring, cheese and some kind of bread, under the paper. Let me just say that again for impact. Moldy food. Cheese. Batter from leftover food smudged in. We took plenty of pictures for historical reasons, of course.  Immediately disgusted, we called over the manager to explain what happened. She apologized, and went to the kitchen and examined every meal that came out. I am extremely displeased with how our visit went. This wasn't the first time we've found moldy food on dishes, or had to wait +1 hour for our service during slow times. I'm not quite sure what is going on behind the scenes, but I think the management staff needs to re-evaluate how cleaning and food management is done. 1 star. -Slow Service -Dirty Plates w/food still attached -Small side-dish portions  -Incorrect ordering during slow days -Extremely noisy environment -Discourteous staff I will not be returning to this place, and I highly recommend others to stay away. Go to TGI Fridays, Bertucchis, Olive Garden, or Moe's instead, they're all much friendlier, cleaner and better food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plymouth?start=20,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002,1.7640000000000002
31,Crosby N.,"Sagamore Beach, MA",15,12,1.0,1.0,2012-09-21,"If you don't feel like reading the entire review then the short version is: DO NOT COME TO THIS LOCATION.  I ordered a ceasar salad, with the dressing on the side, and a side of frys. Not a difficult order, right? And there were hardly any other customers waiting to get food.  After 45+ minutes, with no silverware, my food came out. It was a garden salad with dressing on the side. A garden salad has cucumbers, tomatoes,ice berg lettuce etc. A ceasar salad just has romaine lettuce and some light cheese, that's a huge difference and not what I ordered at all. After recieving the food, I told the waitress it wasn't what I ordered, and instead of apologizing and giving me the correct thing, she told me I could not order a ceasar salad with the dressing on the side, even though its an item listed on the menu, because ""The ceasar salads come premixed, the kitchen can't make one for you with the dressing on the side. I assumed you'd like this just as much""  WHY was this not mentioned before my food came out? Who is this total stranger to assume I would like a totally different meal just as much? Unacceptable. But, it happens, I ignored it. I said ""Well, I'd just like some romaine lettuce in a dish, then"" Which she brought out, but If I can't order a ceasar salad why is it on the menu? When my side of frys finally came out, there were only six in the basket. But I'm not one to complain, so I didn't say anything. I finished my meal, and to help the waitress out, stacked the salad dish on my fry dish. I moved the paper off of the frys, and guess what I saw? Moldy food.  I can only assume they don't wash their plates here. There was dried out cheese, and some kind of moldy batter. I'll attach ALL of the pictures, oh, and I took A LOT pictures.   So not only is this place loud, slow, with unapologetic wait staff, who assume what you want to eat for lunch without asking you, but they're not even up to health code. They would fail, and the restaurant would be shut down, if I was an inspector.  Someone who can do something really should check this place out, it's dirtier than McDonalds.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plymouth?start=20,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000003,1.8280000000000005

34,Adam D.,"Austin, TX",1,4,,1.0,2013-09-02,"Consistently horrible. We have gone here on several occasions and there have been a few constants: the wait staff could obviously not care less about you, the orders, or the cleanliness of the place.  Each time the person that has waited on us has disappeared and not been around for long periods of time, only to rush us once they are available. Not only that, when we order they are always out of at least one thing we want..  Then there's the bathroom and overall cleanliness.. My gf took our 1 1/2 yr old to the restroom and had to use wipes to clean the sink counter off and use a blanket in order to change our daughter bc there was fecal matter all over the changing table and that area. It had appeared to have been that way for quite some time and when we notify our server, she said they would send someone over to clean it. However we intentionally watched for someone and saw not one staff member enter the restroom through the course of our meal. Then as we were finally leaving the server said that they had sent someone in to clean (basically lying to our faces).  Oh and the floors in the whole place were so slippery from what is assume was caked on cooking oil condensate mixed with the remnants of water from a feeble attempt at ""mopping"". Save your money and time and sanity and eat elsewhere..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plymouth?start=20,2.56,2.56,2.56,2.116,2.56

However, if you're on one of those shopping days and need to get a good burger, quick and catch a game. Red Robin in Plymouth is good to go.  I've been a few times and I have to say the highlite everytime was the manager Brian. He picked up I had been there a few times and took care of my party whenever we arrived. Lots of times there was a young bartender or a new server and he always said ""Make sure to take of them, they're regulars."" Whenever we arrived, mind you we had only been there 2-3 times ever.  I learned that Brian isn't at this location anymore after I went in for a beer and a burger. I was by myself and might as well may not have been there at all.

16,Elizabeth C.,"Middleboro, MA",0,10,,3.0,2014-01-27,"I used to work at the Red Robin in Greenville, SC, and have a lot of fond memories there so I'm giving 3 stars.  I would like to mention that the standards were very high at that particular Red Robin.  Then again, I left to come back to MA in early 2008 so a lot may have changed since then.  In any event. My family and I went to the Plymouth RR last night and I ordered my all time favorite Whiskey River BBQ burger with a cup of French Onion soup to start, and a side of broccoli.  We were told the kitchen was out of broccoli.  No biggy, but I did start to get a little antsy that it was taking so long for the soup to come out.  Finally, our burgers arrived and I mentioned that I never got my soup.  Our server seemed to feel bad, and even said that she specifically said to get the FRON out first (but if it was something you were so concerned about, why not check on it periodically?  But I digress). It ended up working out OK, since the onions on my burger were soggy like worms.  It completely grossed me out; I was expecting the crispy onion straws that the BBQ burger is known for!  My soup came right as my burger went back to the kitchen, so at least I had something in front of me while the burger was re-fired.  It came back out about 10 minutes later with an apology from the manager and asked me how it was.  I said fine, but the onion straws were just as soggy and gross as they were the first time around.  Luckily they comped my soup and burger, but I was very disappointed and told our server that though the burger itself tasted good, something was definitely up with the onion straws.  She said she told the kitchen that even SHE could see how soggy they were, and that she was told by the kitchen ""there's only so long we can keep them in the fryer""  ?!?!?  Um, excuse me?  At this point my fiance piped in and said that we were CDT's at the Greenville Red Robin, we'd been eating there for years, and that there had never been a problem with the o-straws before.  Our server proceeded to tell us that she'd gotten complaints from other guests about the same thing.  C'mon, corporate!  We're not stupid; we know something is up! Anyway.  That's my gripe.  Like I said, I'll always have a special spot for Red Robin but last night was most disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plymouth?start=40,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.54,2.44

Luckily we were sat after maybe 15-20 min and had a very friendly waitress Liz. We put in our order right away and she brought us our water and beer immediately. Liz also gave us an iPad to sign up for the rewards card and helped us get it started. Unfortunately it took almost an hour to get our food. We have never waited that long at a Red Robin. We got the whiskey BBQ burger and the burnin love burger.... Both were good, the burnin love was slightly undercooked. We both felt the burgers themselves were very thin. The majority of our Red Robin experiences were in PA and the burgers always seemed a lot thicker. The other issue was the bathrooms. The women's room had 4 stalls... 2 were occupied, 1 was disgusting and unusable, and 1 the lock didn't work. 1 of the stalls in the men's room was also clogged.

29,Kym H.,"Basalt, CO",0,1,,1.0,2015-09-11,"My boyfriend and I went out to dinner today (Friday.) The host and hostess were very friendly. We were seated at a high top in the bar. We sat and waited 10 minutes to even be greeted by a server, in which finally he comes up to us, and rudely says ""I guess I'll be taking care of you, or she will, or that other guy will."" We told him we needed a minute so we could discuss what we wanted to do, to stay or leave. We decided to take our business elsewhere. Apparently no one felt it was necessary to greet us, as I saw about 5 other servers and a manager walking around us. We didn't even want to give it a chance to see how much worse the service could have gotten.

His name is Ben, he greeted me with a warm friendly greeting. He always made sure everything was to my liking. He kept eye contact when he was speaking to me and made me feel welcome. He was always smiling and had a nice vibe.  The food was also great the burger was cooked to perfect, not undercooked and not over cooked. The food was put together with care and not tossed in the plate like other restaurants.  If I get Ben as a server, I will be sure to be back here again and again.

58,Kim B.,"Sandwich, MA",1,11,,1.0,2016-12-15,"DUMP with a capital D.  First, it wasn't busy, so no excuses. Sat at a high top in the bar and waited .... and waited ....and, well, you get the picture.  I  knew it was going to be bad when the male bartender was loudly exclaiming to apparently nobody who cared how he had already been there way too long that day and is brain dead.  I wanted to leave but my boyfriend was starving.  Exhausted bartender finally made his way over.  He was disheveled, loud and annoying.  I asked for a diet coke with lemon. 15 minutes later I got a regular coke, with no ice, and no lemon. I ordered the chicken tortilla soup and my bf got a burger.  Overworked bartender must have fallen asleep behind the bar because he never came back.  Food kept coming out of the kitchen by confused food runners who knew nothing about where said food should be going.  They would stand there dumb as a stump yelling ""whose got the clamdigger chowda""?! A nice couple sat next to us and we warned ""don't stay"".  Anyway, my soup was inedible. Presentation horrible, spilled over sides, not because it was full, because the food runner had the shakes.  Lukewarm, minimal chicken, no sour cream dollop.  My bf's burger was a mess to eat, but alright, but then again, he was starving.  I will never step foot in this place again.  I can't imagine how they are still in business.  Paying the check was another ordeal.  Nobody came to give us a bill, so we used the intrusive machine on the table.  That part was easy but then I realized there was a charge for it.   NEVER AGAIN!  Red Robin should be Dead Robin.

51,Bill D.,"Hanover, MA",1,12,,2.0,2017-02-18,"This Red Robin location has been open about 10 years and unfortunately the bloom is off the rose. Once seated the up selling begins: a drink from the bar, some appetizers, etc. all before looking at a menu. The table kiosks once offered its trivia games for free; now it's $1.99.  Ordering a Black and Bleu Burger, I got what amounted to a 4 ounce (at best) burger for $14.49. The toppings amounted to more substance than did the beef. Red Robin touts its bottomless fries policy and until recently at this location that included offering fries while waiting for one's meal. When I mentioned this fact to the waitress the up selling continued with her offering an order of fries for $1.99!. Other RR locations here and in Florida still offer the pre-meal bottomless fries offering. While our waitress took our order in a timely manner, it took 25 minutes for the burgers to arrive. The burger didn't have much taste of either beef or blue cheese and the fries were over salted. The men's room needed a good cleaning, what with a clogged urinal and generally unclean facilities. And a message to management: even MacDonald's, Wendys and Burger King have WI-Fi! Not here though. It's not all bad, though. Joining the rewards program nets you a free birthday burger, preferably at another RR location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plymouth,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64

53,Sean C.,"Carver, MA",0,44,,1.0,2017-10-19,"This place is going downhill. They don't give kids balloons anymore which, while simple, was a really big deal to my kids. I suppose in the age of virtual reality and social media, most other kids don't care. The fries used to have yummy seasoning on them but don't anymore. They put the seasoning on the table but it doesn't stick to the fries once they start to cool. It's best to season them as soon as they come out of the fryer. Now, I'm on a diet but my 4 year old daughter really wanted to come here for her birthday so I obliged. I ordered the salmon entree. However, it first came out as a sandwich. They took it back into the kitchen to fix it, which consisted of them sliding the salmon off the bun onto the plate. It was disgusting. A thin piece of dry overcooked salmon with overcooked broccoli, some of which was yellow. All this for $15. The server never asked how we liked our food. I think the underwhelming look on my face was enough to make her think twice. We're done with Red Robin. I need to be able to eat healthy when I want to and actually enjoy it. There's plenty of other places where my growing kids can indulge while I get something sensible but delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-plymouth,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92
