Just know that the staff is very lazy and rude and we'll talk about you while you're sitting right there. They are allowed to do this because the management is not much better. Instead of just apologizing to us the manager brought us all free french fries and free onion rings. My husband said we just want good service.  The waitress did try and did okay. She knew we were treated badly so she got our food to us very quickly.  I've only been to one red Robin in Louisville Kentucky and it was fabulous. This one is awful!  The food was only subpar.

38,Andrew F.,"Kalamazoo, MI",218,107,62.0,5.0,2015-09-24,"Red Robin? 5 stars? How could this be?! My history with Red Robin is long, and I've seen the good and the bad. We've been through a lot together, and on the other side of our dark times I've come to appreciate RR for what it is: an excellent choice for a family dinner that isn't going to break the bank, will hopefully have something for everyone, and might just surprise you with some elements of their menu. Let's get right to the crux of the matter: bottomless sides. This is a HUGE thing in RR's favor. If you're going to be a big chain restaurant, there aren't a ton of ways to distinguish yourself. It used to be just unlimited fries, which is cool if you don't mind the calories. However, the bottomless sides have expanded to side salads, steamed broccoli, and other possibly more healthful options. I know ""bottomless"" and ""healthful"" aren't really compatible in the same sentence, but at least I can't eat 2 baskets of fries if I'm busy eating a bunch of roughage! I also want to commend RR for their well-curated menu. It offers you something new every time you come in, often with seasonal flavors, but there is also a core of reliable standbys that you can count on being there if ""Oktoberfestburger"" is not your thing. I will say this: when RR first came to Portage, their standard burger patty was *way* better quality and thicker than what the average burger is now. To get something approximating the original patties, you have to upgrade to one of their premium burgers. That caused a bit of a falling out between RR and me, but like I said before, I've accepted this change and I have learned to love RR, warts and all. I suppose I could write a whole treatise on Red Robin with all of my experience there, but I'll leave it here: pound for pound, a solid restaurant with something for everyone in a fun atmosphere. P.S. Definitely sign up and join their loyalty club...free birthday burger! Seriously we go for every single family member's birthday and free never gets old.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-portage,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006

With a full bar and tons of burgers, appetizers, and of course, fries with their infamous at-table seasoning salt. After landing at the Kalamazoo airport I had massive munchies but didn't want fast food so I directed my personal driver/pool boy to take me to Red Robin.  Translation: I asked my husband if he'd take me after he picked me up. I ordered the Burnin' Love burger because apparently I thought heartburn at 3am would be an AMAZING thing to wake up with. But that may have also occurred because I ate not only the roasted jalapeno that was served on top of the burger, but I ordered extra jalapeno coins as well. My husband ordered the bacon cheeseburger. They were both prepared to our liking and tasted great, the fries were a bit soggy and lukewarm but in all fairness we were the jerks that walked in and asked to be seated at 11:31pm.  Because we were there so close to closing we were a bit rushed by our server. She was friendly but also wanted us to order almost immediately after sitting down so I wouldn't recommend you arrive when they have less than an hour before closing. Also, they shut the milkshake machine down before we got there and I had a hard time dealing with that emotionally.
