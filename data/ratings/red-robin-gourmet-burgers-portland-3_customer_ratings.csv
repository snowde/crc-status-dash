79,Amy K.,"Portland, OR",19,35,2.0,1.0,2013-07-02,"Food is good, but the service suuuuuuuucks. Last Sunday afternoon, my husband, son and I met my mother at the Red Robin at Mall 205 for an early dinner. It was about 5pm when we arrived and the place wasn't busy. There were 8-10 other parties there: not crowded. I repeat: not crowded. My mother arrived first, was seated at a smallish 4-top, let the server know there would three others joining her and ordered an iced tea. She sat reviewing her menu and enjoying her drink, with three other menus arranged on the table. Despite that subtle hint, she said the server TWICE came to take her dinner order. She told her, ""I'm waiting for other people, thanks,"" and gestured to the menus. Duh.  When we arrived (about 10 minutes after Mom had arrived) and joined my mother, we were set upon almost immediately (I had literally just slung my purse onto the back of my chair when the server asked if I was ready to order). I was in the middle of greeting my mom and hadn't even picked up the menu yet. Jesus. We placed our order -- two burgers, a bowl of soup, a chicken wrap, drinks and two appetizers (barbecued wings and artichoke dip). From where he was sitting, my husband could see the pass and noted, about 15 minutes after ordering, that he could see our dinners (who else would order a bowl of soup on a 98° day?!). No sign of the apps and no sign of our server.  While our food was stagnating under the heat lamps, our apps arrived. The server set them down with apologies for their lateness, clattering chips across the tabletop. He left TWO napkins and scuttled away. Barbecued wings. FOUR people. TWO napkins.  Before we could even TOUCH the apps (I shit you not -- not TEN seconds had elapsed between one server leaving and the other arriving), our dinners were presented. The waitress scootched the artichoke dip away from my mother to make room for her soup. My mother, fully annoyed, said, ""The appetizers JUST arrived. Couldn't you have allowed for a little time for us to enjoy them?"" The waitress apologized and said, ""Would you like me to take your dinners away until you're done with the appetizers?"" My mother said no, we'd like our dinner to be served hot. Just dumb. We requested more napkins and got a healthy stack for the table.  I quickly filled up on artichoke dip and didn't have room for my burger. I left it, completely whole with NOT ONE BITE from it, in its basket in front of me. Leftovers for lunch on Monday, sweet! As soon as I could find our server and get a box...  We enjoyed our dinner -- the food is tasty as always, but the service was lackluster. When I needed a box for my burger, she was nowhere to be found. My son needed silverware to cut his burger in half. The staff were clustered in a corner nearby giggling and chatting; we had to flag one down to ask for a knife. We had to flag her down again to refill my husband's ice water. When my son wanted more fries, we gave up trying to flag someone down.  After eating for fifteen minutes, a server came to bus the table. He took away the appetizer dishes and reached for my mother's soup bowl when she -- honest to God -- had a spoonful of soup ascending to her mouth. She shook her head, annoyed, and he began to scoop up my burger. MY WHOLE, UNEATEN BURGER. I said, ""Hey, no. I need a box for that."" He returned with a small box (the kind you might fit a cupcake in) and I had to mash my larger burger into it. He then took the rest of our dishes away.  We then sat for -- I COUNTED -- 8 minutes. Our server finally came by to ask how everything was. My mother explained about the mix-up with the apps, the lack of napkins, the absentee service. No explanations, no excuses, no apologies. The server asked if we'd like refills on our drinks. We were very obviously ready to go (purses in laps, debit card in hand, hint, hint) and we had to ask for the check.  The server went to her station, printed the invoice and slipped it into the portfolio. She left it on the table and started to leave. My mother said, ""Can I just pay this now?"" The server seemed annoyed (mind you, it was no busier than when we'd arrived) and took our payment. My mom asked us, ""Was I supposed to take that to the front?"" The server's attitude made her -- the customer -- feel like she'd done something wrong. I assured her, no, they're SUPPOSED to process the payments.  We arrived in GOOD moods and left in BAD moods. Never a good sign. The food again was good. The service has never been great at the Mall 205 location, but now it's positively abysmal. No thanks, Red Robin.  Sorry this is so long. I'm still irritated.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-portland-3?start=60,2.148,2.148,2.148,2.148,2.148

The fries are good. I'm not usually a fan of the ""steak"" cut but these were perfectly cooked, hot and fresh tasting. There is a little menu of dipping sauces that cost 50 cents each and we had the roasted garlic and the green chile varieties. Nothing beats ketchup, but these were a nice break when you're devouring bottomless fries. Our server was attentive and above average for a fast-casual place. We heard the server behind us relentlessly trying to upsell his customers - he obviously took all the corporate training very seriously- but ours was always there when needed and never intrusive and got an above average tip for it.  Sit in the bar for a pleasant screaming kid - free area. There seemed to be a lot of screaming kids coming in and we were glad they offered us the respite of the bar to eat in. Take that, McDonalds!  Of course if you have screaming kids you will feel very welcome here.

My family actually ate at this Red Robin multiple times every single week without incident up until tonight. I don't see us EVER returning after the DISGUSTING way that we were treated by the management. We were sitting at our table awaiting our food when the child from the table next to us pounded on our table with both fists.  We were surprised and not happy as we have a 4 and 6 year old who are not permitted to behave that way.  The mother of the child began making comments about how WE HAD A PROBLEM until we finally asked her to stop.  It was impossible to ignore as their table was only about 14-16 inches away from ours.  I asked this woman at least 6 times to just quit talking to me and she called me an obscene name in front of my two small children (as well as her own.)  Both my partner and I said ""Are you kidding?  We have kids sitting here! Just stop talking to us.  Leave us alone!"" This is where Red Robin management really had a chance to shine.  Roger, apparently the manager on duty, approached our tables and without even pausing to find out what was going on told us we need to immediately stop talking.  Yes, just stop talking.  After I was verbally assaulted, called names and harassed in their restaurant, I had every reason to be upset.  My 6 yr old was in tears and visibly very distressed.  Upon his approach, I tried to explain to Roger what had transpired and he actually SNEERED and said, ""Good for you. Now stop talking."" Obviously we decided to leave.  We were basically attacked at our table then the manager comes over and joins in on it??? To add insult to injury, some other person who knew the offensive couple rushed after me as I left and actually grabbed my arm and hissed insults at me while I held my4 year old.  Thanks Red Robin.  I feel so safe in your restaurant after being both verbally and physically attacked.  If Roger wasn't such a dismissive, contemptuous individual I wouldn't blame Red Robin at all, but the response to what happened to me as a regular, frequent patron and HUMAN BEING is beyond unacceptable and ridiculous.  This manager has no business dealing with the public and should be immediately dismissed.BOOOOOOO, Red Robin.

The main section of the dining area has been rearranged and the furnishings upgraded.  I only walked through on my way to the bathroom so don't recall too many details but it looks great.

Red Robin Restaurants however; are loud. Because of the decor, the din of other diners makes it hard to hear your dining companions talk. We found the perfect solution with the Mall 205 location's secluded patio. The patio sits right off the bar and was a true hidden gem. It HAD full grown shrubbery that let the breeze through yet gave ample shade for the hottest day. The shrubbery provided privacy from the traffic on Washington street and the Mall 205 parking lot. Imagine our horror today to find the patio devoid of any shade or privacy. Yeah, that's exactly what we want, to see and hear all the utility trailers from Home Depot clanking past us while we eat. This is a good example if ""If it ain't broke don't fix it"". Had the idiot who came up with this idea asked staff who had been there awhile, I bet they would have advised not to mess with it. But, as with most organizations, management rarely consults with the front line workers who actually do the work. Not having a secluded, shaded, summer time patio is A DEAL BREAKER Red Robin.

The standard setup looked like it would fit 10 people perfectly and the highchair would sit between the parents. As we started to sit down, the first of two hostesses comes over and asks us to step back and they can add another table for more seating... no one asked for more seats.  After playing musical chairs and moving two tables, we were seated and separated by the giant L shape table we were just crafted. At this point, I was frustrated I couldn't sit near by kids, and they couldn't sit across from their uncle and aunt. We were seated a total of 30 seconds before we were asked if we would want drinks. Greatest moment of the entire service... Brace yourself, it's downhill from here. The kind waitress we had assigned to our table seemed to be overwhelmed by the conundrum created by the tables. After a few minutes of walking through the gauntlet of chairs she was able to get our orders and was gone. We saw her once more when our drinks were delivered and that was it until food was ready.  During the meal, my wife and I had our bottomless fries refilled once, and only one of our lemonades was ever refilled. (I'm still quite parched) My daughter asked for a cheese pizza meal and received pepperoni (and no one responded when we questioned it). Most of the food was good, but far smaller portions than other nearby restaurants for the same price. Overall the food wasn't worth the troubles we had just to be seated. Appreciate the waitress and her effort to make things better but definitely not a visit I want to remember.  Perhaps a one-off bad experience, but this makes two in a row for my family... last time we were here was prior to renovations so let that weigh in on the quality for revisits.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-portland-3,2.32,2.32,2.32,2.2800000000000002,2.32

I don't understand why, when a restaurant is not at all busy it takes forever to get service, then when we do get it our food comes out barely warm, if warm, and our server disappears after telling us they are going to bring fries for one of the kids who asked for them. They were apologetic when they returned and did realized they forgot the fries, and then brought some posts haste. I just don't get it. It's not that difficult, especially when it's not busy. If it were a Friday or Saturday night with a big crowd, then maybe I could see a delay in service and perhaps some warm food but there might have been 10 tables or less...on top of that, when I got my burger, the peppercorn burger, it looked sickened compared to the photoshopped image on the menu, not tasty looking all. I've been here before and had pretty good service and food, so this visit will not deter me from returning in the future in hopes of a better experience. When they are good, they are good!

Came here on a very nice day, in a lift car, and boy was my hamburger, nice and fresh. Service was very friendly and attentive at all times, and I was asked if I needed more fries, or another refill on my drink. After I ate, I went outside to red robins nice little handicapped parking lot, and hailed my last Lyft taxi, to head home. That is one of the most beautiful things about red Robin, is that it's not just the food, and friendly service, but it's also because of the fact that they have a handicapped parking spot, and that was perfect for Lyft to park into to pick me up. So, if you have a handicapped, you are definitely in luck if you use Lyft taxi cab service to pick you up, The handicapped parking lot is so large, that lift will just pull right in, and park without a hitch. So, I just have to say, it was a very wonderful visit today here at red Robin, despite it being close to the 90s outside.

We asked for a table for 5 and did not have to wait very long to be seated.  Our drink order was taken quickly and served expeditiously. We ordered the large onion ring tower as an appetizer and that was out fairly fast too. Once our food orders were taken the waiter had refills out to us.

36,Steve B.,"Portland, OR",0,2,,1.0,2017-11-19,"If I could give this place negative five stars, I would.  What should of been a simple online to-go order turned into one of the most frustrating experiences I've ever had at a restaurant. In the past, there was a sign near the bar for To Go orders at this Red Robin. Now there is a separate table out front. The problem is nobody seems to be staffing this table. Eventually the hostess came over and asked if I'd been helped, and I said no. She went to get someone from the back who then came out and asked for my name on the order. She went and looked and said that no order came in. This was the start of what would be a very long back and forth I had with multiple employees. I was asked if I could of sent it somewhere else and I said no, I made the online order for this location, with a set pickup time, 100% sure of that. At that point the employee asked what I had ordered and I told her, and she wrote it down, saying they would have to place it manually. After doing this, however, she asked me if I was SURE that I sent the order to the Red Robin on Washington Street. I replied that I'm looking at the order on my phone, and it specifically says the Mall 205 Red Robin. At this point I was getting annoyed and I said I can show you the email on my phone or give you the order number, and she barked no at me and went to go pawn me off on another employee Another woman came out this time who was a little nicer, but once again I was asked if I submitted the order to another location, and I gave the same response.  At this point I asked to speak to whoever the manager is, because apparently I'm not doing a good enough job communicating. Finally, a guy in a suit came out who introduced himself as an assistant manager.  Once again I was asked if I was sure if I submitted the order here, and by this time I was pissed. I came here with a small 2 year old child in tow to quickly pick up a caesar wrap and a kids chicken sticks, and here I am being bombarded with questions on am I sure I placed the order correctly, all the while trying to be a decent parent and entertain a 2 year old. I once again offered to show the email with my order information. The assistant manager went into the back and apparently produced an email they received showing there was an error with my order.  He said the issue was that the error email came in 15 minutes before the pick up time, that they aren't in the back sitting around monitoring emails all the time. I replied neither am I, and I'd already left my house by the time any email would of arrived to me. I was told its a ""technical error"" that happens about once a month, that its not really their fault, and it just sucks that it happened to me. I was asked if I still wanted to order my food. At this point my jaw dropped because an employee had come out and written down the order manually, and I assumed my order would already be going. I mentioned that and he made a comment about not knowing if I really wanted the food, so it hadn't been started. I'm chasing around a fussy two year old and have been here a half hour now, so yeah, I probably do want it. I told him that was ridiculous and I want the name of his manager. I was given a card with a name on it that said assistant general manager but that they aren't in until tomorrow, told me he would take 15% off my order, then slipped away to the back before I could even respond.  I don't know if this person is actually his manager, but it wouldn't surprise me if he tried to dump me on his weekday equivalent. This has very little to do with money to me, as it was just a simple $15 order. The staff could of apologized for the error, offer to take half off the total, make it a priority and whip the order out in 10 minutes. In the end, it took well over an hour to get what should of been a very simple order. I had a two year old child that was running around with poopy pants because it took so long, that wanted no part of waiting around. There was no apology, no taking responsibility by the staff, even worse having multiple employees trying to blame me for the mistake. Most of the employees I interacted with showed little to no professionalism what-so-ever, and its clear this place has gone downhill even faster than I thought. I've never had staff attack me like this and try to blame me for something that was clearly an error on the Red Robin end. I've dined in here before at this location and seen mistakes happen, but the staff at least made an effort to make it right in the past. This time, however, that didn't occur. After all was said and done, I got a pathetic looking caesar wrap that barely had any meat in it, and two of the smallest orders of fries I've ever seen from here which were already cold by the time I even got in the car. I'll be escalating this up as far as I can up the ladder until I reach someone who actually understands customer service, and that this location has some serious problems that need to be looked at and dealt with.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-portland-3,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
