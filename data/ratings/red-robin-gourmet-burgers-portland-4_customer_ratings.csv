Me and my boyfriend took our son and our neighbor/friend, planning on meeting up with her girlfriend when she got there. As soon as we were seated, the waiter proceeded to shove his foot in his mouth, not once, but almost every time he approached our party for the whole time we were there. I felt really sorry for him because you could tell he knew it. He was friendly, but overly, and loud. Back to the food, it was great as usual, who doesn't love endless french fries?

HOWEVER when a friend and I went tonight we gave our card to the waitress she came back with two card declined slips. This made no sense as the balance was LITERALLY just checked prior to sending her away with the card, and there was a fair amount over the total balance of the check. We called the bank its said the card had first been approved for a balance far from what our total was from this location. It over drafted the account in fact. And then, the card was declined for times for the correct total. They stated they couldnt find the transaction, the waitress was quiet bitchy about the situation. And the management didnt want to refund the difference even after pulling up the bank statement and verifying that the transaction had indeed just came from his location. He also wasnt clear on what would happen if the charges went from pending to clear, and the account got over drawn. On top of that, they had the audacity to request we pay with another form of payment, even though they saw clearly the payment PLUS WAY MORE had already been taken from the account.  After making a fuss the manager gave us a card to call if the payment went threw and said hed take care of the meal. Either way service wasnt handled professionally and I am outraged by the situation.  We will never be going back to this location.

65,Dan N.,"Forest Grove, OR",53,238,131.0,4.0,2012-12-24,"Okay, so understanding that this is a huge nationwide chain, and their food ranges in the $7-12 range, I'm not expecting to hop into a Red Robin and get five-star food and five-star service. It's not that I'm really counting--I'm not, but I've probably eaten at ten different Red Robin restaurants in three states--perhaps 30 visits total over the past 10 years.  It's not like we're there once a week. That said, this is about your average Red Robin, no better nor worse than the others.  The food here is decent.  Being December 23 and at the south end of a mall parking lot, it was understandably a zoo.  The service, in our visit, was really good.  We were seated within about 3 minutes.  Our orders were taken and the food arrived all within a span of perhaps ten minutes. Being calorie-conscious (more on that in a moment) I ordered the ""Simply Grilled Chicken Sandwich"".  It's just like it sounds.  A lovely chicken breast, plainly grilled but still flavorful and quite juicy.  Lettuce, tomatoes, red onion and pickle slices adorn the side--I used them all and created a lovely and flavorful 400-calorie sandwich.   Wife N. ordered her favorite: the Prime Rib Dip, hold the onions (as she dislikes onions).  Flavorful--certainly not the most fantastic dip ever but decent.   Now, all of the above total to a three-star rating, good, but nothing to drive across town for.   But there's some other stuff going on here that pushes this to a solid 4*s for us.  Here's why: 1. They have the most generous rewards program I've personally seen in a chain restaurant.  Buy 9 items, get one free. They also randomly just add in little freebies on the card---""surprise, you get a big shake for free""---yep, that's where I blew my calorie count yesterday, but that cookies-n-cream shake was OH SO GOOD! 2. Very family-friendly, and very-light-eater-friendly.  They always allow our 14-year-old-but-looks-16 daughter to eat from the kid's menu.  This is chain-wide, not just this store.  And they're totally happy to split any item onto two plates so two can share a light lunch.  In fact, we've been out with several light-eating adults whom they freely allowed to order off the kids menu---frankly, your age doesn't seem to matter to them: want a kids' meal? No problem. 3. All-you-can-stand fries.  I've found the initial load of fries to be getting smaller over time.  But you can always order more for free.  Anything that comes with fries is ""bottomless"" on the fries. 4. Bottomless drinks (except alcohol and shakes).  Any soda/pop is refillable and any of their cool creations like their Freckled Lemonade, Raspberry Limeade, etc. are also bottomless. 5. Burgers: honestly, great selection, great options, really good taste.  Zero complaints there. All in all, this is a really good place to eat for your average couple or family.  It's a bit loud, so maybe not the place place for two to have ""romantic conversation"" but as general out-shopping-with-the-family-hey-wanna-grab-a-bite-places it's definitely a good choice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-portland-4?start=80,3.36,3.36,3.36,3.056,3.3600000000000003

It can get pretty loud but it's reasonable for a family-style restaurant. What I do like are their fries and the zesty seasoning you sprinkle on.

43,Christina D.,"Raleigh, NC",20,21,12.0,3.0,2015-02-20,"I've been to plenty of Red Robins but only twice to this location. This last visit was only because it was convenient to do so. Service: First time here was pretty good. The server wasn't rude but she wasn't friendly either. Very neutral and she seemed to focus more on talking with her coworkers. Second visit the server was friendly but absent much of the time. I noticed another table with two teenish to college age girls were kind of abandoned, one freckled lemonade empty for a good five to ten minutes. When the server brought their food, they had asked for a sauce and another order of fries. Server never showed back up until she brought the check and they ended up getting boxes for their food and left. We did have a lot of time to sit around and wait too: waiting to have our orders taken, waiting to have our food served, and another wait to get the credit card back. It wasn't horrendous since my husband and I actually enjoy hanging out with each other so it wasn't silent and awkward but it was definitely a longer than usual wait for each action from the server. Luckily, after seeing what went on at the other table, we made sure to ask for sauces we needed at the time of ordering and when we got our food, we promptly asked for refills and another order of fries before the server disappeared again. Which was a good call, she really did just poof until she felt it enough time to bring the check. Food: If you get down the the foundations of a good burger, RR's patties are flavorless and the default buns are just meh bread. They do not season the meat at all so it really depends on your toppings and sauces to make it anything decent which is sad because the price has crept upwards and the burgers are the same quality. I have gotten the Sauteed Shroom burger many times so I know what to expect and it was the same quality as other locations. Very mild with the swiss and the light flavor of garlic from the mushrooms. Not horrible, but nothing to flail my arms and run a lap frantically around the restaurant about. I still haven't quite yet figured out how to make it better. My husband's Royal was better once he started asking for a cheese substitution and some mustard because otherwise it was meh too. The fries that came with the burgers were cold, limp, and so very sad. The second batch was hot, fresh, and crunchy and great with the campfire sauce. I am not quite sure why some people were complaining about their server not asking if they wanted more fries. Like with any complimentary thing, it's one of those selling points to bring people in but you don't actively push it or your business loses money needlessly. But it's not like they hide the fact since the menu and almost all the signage screams ""OMG BOTTOMLESS FRIES"". The small metal cup of fries is comparatively tiny when they used to fill half the basket before but it's wasteful. Sure you'd like to see a pile of fries you couldn't possibly finish served with your burger but that's foodstuffs that's going in the trash later. Isn't it better to get manageable batches at a time that you can finish and then get more if you still want more? It's still bottomless fries. What's the big deal? TL;DR: Service is kind of on the bad side. Prep ahead and order what you need before you need it (sauces, refills, and such). Food isn't bad but it could be better. Don't expect the patties to be seasoned; the toppings are what will make it taste better. Fries are bottomless. Order more if the tiny cup isn't enough when you get it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-portland-4?start=60,3.2,3.2,3.2,1.9000000000000001,3.2000000000000006

And ... waited. And waited some more. Finally someone came around to greet us and seat us. They originally tried to seat us at the sardine booth and we requested a larger booth. When this occurred the hostess rolled her eyes at us and put the menus on the table and abruptly left.  We waited about 5 minutes to order appetizers when our waitress finally came around.  Looking around the restaurant wasn't super busy but tables were definitely spread out. Looking at who was serving we could only visibly see 2 servers waiting on roughly 20 tables. So about 10 tables a piece. We ordered our food and requested that the food come out after the appetizers. We ate our appetizers which came out with a reasonable time, and then began to wait for our food. And waited.... Waited some more.... And continued to wait.... 45 minutes have passed and we ask our waitress if our food was planning on coming out anytime soon. She says yes and disappears for another 15 minutes. All the while drinks have gone empty and my husband is falling asleep at the table while waiting for our food. Looking around at other tables that arrived just before us or after - tables that had gotten there after had already gotten their food. Frustrated I ask the waitress again how come other tables that were seated after us got their food but we hadn't. She apologized again and disappeared for another 10 minutes. We were short of leaving because our food had yet to arrived and have gotten better service at other restaurants that were still open closer to home when our food finally showed up. After finishing our food we had to run our waitress down for the bill otherwise we'd have been sitting there for another 30 minutes. Luckily for the restaurant my husband and I were not in a hurry as we had already been there well over an hour waiting on our food, but the service over all wasn't the greatest.

41,Michael F.,"Alameda, CA",0,63,,1.0,2015-05-14,"""That's so gay...!!!"" No - I am not referring to this so-called restaurant with that (to me) offensive statement... that was the first comment my partner and I overheard after being seated in the Bar next to a table of off-duty Red Robin employees... So - it's a Thursday night around 8:00 p.m.  The place is not crowded (except, it seems, with an over-abundance of RR employees, both on and off-duty).  We were led from the uncrowded dining area of the place to the crowded (literally, with regard to space, and also with the # of parties seated there) Bar (just squeezing between stools at the Bar and the adjacent tables was risking bruising a hip or leg the space is so tight).  We were seated at a table next to one with two off-duty RR employees (later, to be joined by two others who were just getting off duty, and also populated, at various times, by other on-duty employees who just seemingly stopped by to chat or drop a line or two into the ongoing inane conversations (including the afore-mentioned ""that's so gay"" comment that was dropped as soon as we sat down). OK - as a former restaurant GM, I have some serious questions about this place... One - why does a place have so many wait staff?  On a Thursday night? Two - how can the bartender keep up with her job while simultaneously (and constantly) talking inane drivel with both customers (one, a man, seemingly someone of long-term patronage) and on-duty and off-duty employees alike.  Granted, the woman seems to have a ""sparkling"" personality - but - she did not shut up the whole time we were seated there.  Maybe it would have been Ok (and perhaps entertaining) but seriously, she was talking some really inane B/S most of the time. Three - off duty employees should NEVER be seated next to customers who are dining... in this case, the employees were drinking, talking loudly, and, as noted, saying things that were offensive to the two customers seated right next to them. (We were waiting for the heavy-set blonde one to say ""that's so gay"" one more time  so we could have said, in unison, ""Oh, that's so straight fat white girl"" loud enough to be overheard). The service was, at best, poor and ""ho hum"".  Our waitress took our order and delivered it - and that's all we saw of her until she came at the end to try to ""up sell"" a dessert or ""another drink for you two?"".   We had a Cobb salad and a cup of French Onion soup (besides our drinks) and it took about 1/2 hour for the order to be filled and delivered.  I OVER-tipped - not out of gratitude, but as a compensation to stifle my desire to 1) stiff our waitress and 2) not make a scene, upon leaving, telling the fat str8 white girl how offensive she was. The food - nothing to write home about with praise... it was food, yes, but over-priced for what we got and the overall ""dining experience"" that was Red Robin. We are from out of state - so unlikely that we'll ever return.  If we were local, we would surely NOT return (except, perhaps, with a cadre of queer folk to picket the place for being out-of-line with ""funny"" remarks such as ""that's so gay""...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-portland-4?start=60,2.64,2.64,2.64,1.7960000000000003,2.64

Today was especially dreadful. Sat in the bar with my wife, as we normally do to avoid the dreaded ""wait."" Our server stopped by really quick with menus and asked for drinks. As I hadn't even finished sitting down, I declined a drink at that point. I then fiddled around with their new fangled kiosks that allow you to order drinks and food without talking to a person. After today's experience, the machine might have been more helpful. Our server came back, I ordered a beer, and we placed our food order. I had the new southern charm burger, extra pink, fries, bacon aioli and a side wedge salad. Wife ordered the Avo Cobb salad, no tomatoes and a side of fruit.  Lunch was in full swing, bar was full, but not packed, and servers/ bartender seemed to be in a nice spot.  Both our sides came out after about 10-15 minutes, which was nice since we were getting nicely hungry. My wedge was standard, and enjoyable. The wife's ""fruit salad"" appeared to be the same stuff the bar dumps into wine for their sangria. Frozen strawberries, canned mandarin oranges, and diced apple. Not super thrilled with the offering.  Her Cobb salad had tomatoes, and the garlic ""toast"" was more like garlic ""charcoal."" My burger came out with a side of raw baby carrots, not fries. Both entrees came out just a few minutess after the sides had been dropped, and the runner tried to give it to the table behind us. I think our server could tell something was wrong, as she showed up right after the food was dropped. We told her about the missing fries, and my wife's salad having tomatoes in it when requested without.  She looked at us like a deer in the headlights, asked us what we wanted her to do, and then blamed it all on the kitchen.

We were in the Tigard area and decided to give it another try. I ordered my favorite crispy chicken salad and the BF got one of the premium burgers. We were starving and the food took a long time. When it came out, we were psyched. But as soon we started eating, things went down hill. Everything was cold. The chicken on my salad was not freshly cooked. It was cold and dried up like it had been cooked and cut up hours before. The accompanying ""warm"" flatbread was two pieces of dried French bread that was dry, unseasoned, and stone cold. It dissolved into dust when you bit into it.  The burger was heavily spiced with poultry seasoning for some odd reason. It tasted like stuffing. And it was cold. We asked for more fries as soon as our food came out. They arrived after we finished and were...you guessed it...stone cold. Never again.  But the water was good.  This is not a cheap restaurant.

Shouldn't be a problem right? Well Bryan took 20 minutes to come back to our table and tell us that the coupon couldn't be used on a split check because it was buy one get one half off, however there was no such verbiage on the coupon that said anything about a BOGO, it just said 50% off a burger. The manager (who couldn't be bothered to give us her name) came over and wasn't much better. She said the mailer would have more details on the coupon but who brings in a whole mailer with them to a restaurant?! I usually don't give poor reviews but this constituted a very poor one. Bryan is either new or does not belong in a job where he must be personable, knowledgeable and move with a sense of purpose. As for the manager, do a better job training your people because this sort of service should never be acceptable at ANY level in a restaurant. When you are across the street from a restaurant that has similar prices, much friendlier wait staff/management and a staff that moves with a sense of urgency, you need to hold yourselves to a higher standard and I'm not sure that this staff is capable of that.

My family and I love Red Robin and we usually have exceptional service at this location however, the last two times we've dined there service as well as quality has been sub par. Today my family and I went in for an early dinner. When ordering I noticed that they no longer had the ""Tavern Fires"" on the menu. I asked the server if it was still available and she responded, ""it should be"". So we placed our order for the Tavern Fries and a couple of burgers. Well after a while we noticed that all the other tables around us had their appetizers and it had been a little over 15 minutes since we ordered and our Tavern Fries and hadn't received anything yet. We stopped the server to ask her about it and she looks at us confused and says ""Oh let me check with the kitchen"" she returns to let us know they no longer have that on the menu. Ok... so why didn't you tell us that when we ordered it 15 minutes ago???? Anyway we decided to just drop it and wait for our food. Shortly after our food was bought to the table. I bit into my Pig Out Tavern Double and notice a funny taste. I open it up to see that they put blue cheese in my burger instead of the regular american cheese. So I waived down the server and tell her that I have blue cheese in my burger. She grabs it from me, no I apologies , I will have another one made nothing! Just takes it from me and returns to the kitchen... OK so I assumed they were making another one.... another 15 minutes later I stop her again asking on the status of my burger. She goes back to the kitchen and returns with the burger.. No I'm sorry! Nothing just puts the burger down. Fine I'm ready to eat... Perfect just the way I like it, even though now, my family is all done with their dinner. Fast forward to the end I go to pay the bill and noticed that I have 2 tavern burgers on my bill WTF... My patience is now wearing thin. I stop the manager to explain and all I get is .... Oh they just forgot to take it off. That's it.. Now I come from a customer service background and I understand that mistakes are made and I don't expect free stuff, but when you messed up more then once in one seating I believe some type of discount should be made... I guess the manager overheard me so she offered $5.00 off. Really talk about a slap in the face! I would of at least removed the $8.99 burger and apologized for the mess up.... I guess we will be going to another location. Oh and I forgot to mention this was during a very slow period there was no more then 5 tables in the restaurant at the time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-portland-4?start=20,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8
2,Jody J.,"Portland, OR",161,240,1079.0,3.0,2017-07-25,"Time to update my review.    Entered the restaurant between lunch and dinner crowds.  I was greeted with a smile and provided the menu promptly.    My drink order was received pretty fast.  I then ordered the Clucks and Fries which is really chicken strips and fries.  My food was received within 10 minutes... Which is pretty great. Unfortunately the chicken strips were overcooked and dry inside.  The fries were good.  There didn't appear to be a manager around. Apparently when things are slow everyone congregates in the lounge and watches TV, instead of cleaning tables, the floor and taking care of the many other things they could.  They were loud and very noticeable.  I have noticed some personnel change here recently, I do not know if people are just on vacation or?  The other prior employees did not seem to be like this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-portland-4,2.8,2.81,2.81,,2.806

1,Teresa S.,"Portland, OR",0,1,,2.0,2017-08-10,"I wanted a burger, kinda last minute decision for dinner, and this location is not far from my house, so we decided to go.  We went around 6:30 on a Thursday night, were told the wait was 15-20 minutes even though we could see open tables all around the restaurant.  We only waited maybe 10 minutes and were seated.  The server came to get our drink order promptly, and the water and a beer arrived fairly quickly.   We ordered 2 burgers, and then we waited, and waited, and waited.  Several tables who were seated after us got their meals before us.  Our server didn't come by to check on us or give us an update.  The meals arrived, the fries were lukewarm and the mushroom burger bun was soggy (from the mushrooms I guess?), like it had been sitting awhile before being delivered. The bacon cheeseburger was well-done to the point of being really dry, but the onion rings were fresh and hot.  Our server came to check on us, we told her about the fries, and she promptly brought a basket right out of the fryer. We waited again for the check to be brought, but then the server was quick to process it. Summary:  the food is OK, but a little expensive for what you get, the room is noisy, and the service is slow.  As an overall dining experience, the good doesn't outweigh the bad for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-portland-4,2.68,2.76,2.76,,2.728

Husband got all the way home only to realize the ranch and campfire sauce we asked for were not there, the French fries were bland with no seasonings what so ever, the burgers we ordered without tomato came WITH tomatoes. My family has been coming here for big family dinners for almost 6 years. (And by big family dinners I mean 10-13 people every time.)

7,Laula S.,"Honolulu, HI",0,7,18.0,2.0,2017-09-12,"Came in here today around 3:30 pm. The place was dead. The only reason the place is getting 2 stars instead of 1 is because our server was really nice.  The food is just okay, the shroom burger was tasty but boring no lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle nothing. Just a bun, burger, cheese, and mushrooms. Sweet potato fries we got we're old and refried, stale, hard and cold. Steak fries with the other burger was old, stale, and cold. The burgers are so small, you can get a big Mac meal for cheaper at McDonald's.  We decided to order a second batch of fries to see if they'd be cold. Steak fries came out first, cold, stale, old obviously from.the same batch. Sweet potato fries were hot and fresh the second time around. I took pictures of both fries so you can see the difference in the color with the old fries and the fresh ones.  We let the server know that the steak fries were unacceptable. And so were the first batch of sweet potato fries. He said he'd tell a manager who was 20ft away. They took 2 measly dollars off our bill. The manager who wasn't far was standing around talking to some people didn't even bother to come over and apologize or address the problem.  Overall we will NEVER visit another red Robin again. I'd suggest going to cheesecake factory up the road instead. Gourmet burgers? I think not.. no where close, I'd rather go to five guys.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-portland-4,2.48,2.7,2.7,,2.612

0,Rose E.,"Portland, OR",448,462,2334.0,4.0,2018-01-01,"I typically wouldn't give 4 stars to a burger chain, but due to the significant effort, improvement, and service, it's warranted.  I've been out of the area a little while now, have had a few not-so-great experiences at other locations, and was craving a burger so I decided to give this place another try. Due to the last few experiences My expectations were not grand, however I was pleased with the experience and my daughter also seemed satisfied.  I still strongly dislike the parking lot. Not only are the spots way too small, the lines have now faded, so it's tricky to see how to get into the spots, and the lighting seems dimmer. Even though there are multiple entrances, it's hard to get into the lot and park conveniently.  They were very busy and had a wait despite it being after 8pm, but offered immediate seating in the bar, which was also packed. We opted to wait for a table, and since we were starving, the wait fortunately took only a few minutes.  It took me longer to figure out what to order. When I'm really hungry I have a hard time deciding what to get. Especially at a place where most of the choices are pretty much the same. After all, they are all just burgers.  I finally picked a taco burger, which was really good but was a mistake since I am unable to finish an entire burger in one sitting, and guac doesn't keep. My daughter went with her usual, the teriyaki burger, which they call the bonzai. We both had substituions. She likes to add onions and change the cheese. I like to get the sweet potato fries. Everything with the meal went smoothly for the most part. There was one minor issue that was addressed immediately before we even asked so I will not complain about it.  Our server, Tyna or Tanya? Was great. Very patient, on the ball, and attentive.  She was helpful with the menu and the check was exactly right. Even though I'm not a huge RR or burger fan, and this location is quite a bit out of my way, I'd go to this location over the several that are closer to my house.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-portland-4,2.4,2.65,2.65,,2.55

Came into the restaurant to put my name in for a table, and was told it would be an hour long wait. Gave the hostess Ellie my name and phone number. She told me they would text/call me 10 minutes before the table was ready. Went to go do some shopping within walking distance. After an hour and no text/call I went back to Red Robin. Ellie told me the table was given away. I asked if they called or texted me and she said yes, but there were no notifications on my phone. The manager then came over and told me that they do not call or text customers to notify them when the table is ready. So I was lied to and had to waste more of my time waiting for a table. Staff and management were very unapologetic. This negatively impacted my friends and my experience for the rest of the meal.
