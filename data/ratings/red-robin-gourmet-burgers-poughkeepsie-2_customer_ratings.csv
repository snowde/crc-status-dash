Though, when one finally arrived, I wasn't in a rush to go.  I did finally go a few times with friends to check it out.  Burgers are solid, but this is a chain so of course you're not going to get any crazy gourmet concoctions that knock you off your seat.  It's a little expensive considering the food, but all-in-all, for being a chain, the ambiance is nice.  Your cheap option (right next door!) is Five Guys. I am addicted to french fries, so I appreciate their 'bottomless fries' deal, but I think it would be wasted on most people because fried potatoes are so filling that you are lucky if you can get more than 2 baskets stuffed into your face before giving up. I would go back, but only if I had a little extra money to spend and wanted to spend a little extra time with friends sitting in a booth and BS'ing.  The burgers may be better at Five Guys (I don't think so, but most people do) but the atmosphere is better in 'Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-poughkeepsie-2?start=60,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005,3.0200000000000005

I also wanted to bring a friend from Boston who raved about the burger & egg burgers he gets at Remy's near Fenway.  Service was very prompt, and I've always liked the extra effort the wait staff gives to new customers.  Evidently at some point in the past they changed how you want your burgers from doneness to pink-or-not-pink on the inside - that or I've just been oblivious to it. My guac & bacon burger was quite tasty, and my Boston friend loved his Royal Red Robin.  The french fries didn't fare as well. They were large and relatively meaty but without a lot of flavor - or, as my Boston friend said, ""They tasted like they just came from the Ore-Ida factory.""  I finished my fries after my burger, and the fries left a not-quite-right aftertaste.   I always wondered how Red Robin & 5 Guys competed so close to each other. Obviously they aren't really competing. You go to 5 Guys if you want a superb basic burger and fantastic fries. You go to Red Robin if you want a good specialty burger, or unlimited quantities of mediocre fries, or a drink or two with your meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-poughkeepsie-2?start=20,3.0840000000000005,3.0840000000000005,3.0840000000000005,3.0840000000000005,3.0840000000000005

25,Chris B.,"Red Hook, NY",7,825,459.0,3.0,2013-07-20,"A couple of years ago, when I heard about ""Red Robin Restaurants"" I thought to myself, ""where the Lord Dickens is a Red Robbins close to me?""  When I checked the webpage, it said there was one that was a 40 minute drive at this location, and I thought to myself, ""One day, I'll actually come here to see what it's like.""  I waited and waited and waited some more, one day I checked the website even, and I saw their menu. Well, the wait was over, as of yesterday.  I'm glad I waited.  The experience was very pleasant.  Not only did I get the gourmet meal I had always hoped to find on my plate (it was a grilled chicken sandwich) but it also came with nice juicy steak fries-that were even on a ""bottomless"" quantity.  And not to say that the sandwich wasn't juicy (which it was), but it was a little smaller than average, and didn't come with mayonnaise, which, on part, was a fault of mine. But chicken sandwiches aren't the only sandwiches they have.  Most of their menu items come as sandwiches.  And when you factor in the bottomless steak fries, this is a VERY GOOD DEAL.   I totally saw the bottomless root beer float too.  It had been SO, SO LONG since I last had one.  It tasted so delicious, I knew I just had to have it! Now, this experience came at a couple of costs.  Not only was the bathroom loud and noisy with the radio blaring and even a working TV on, but also the urinal in the men's room wasn't working, and one of the stalls had no toilet paper, except a few unopened rolls of toilet paper on the floor that I had to manually fill for the employees instead (erg!)! And when you top the cost off with the experiences at our table which wasn't fitting to our ever-growing waistlines while they seated people who were slim at tables that could have been expanded, this just wasn't right. Oh, and then they have the audacity, to close up all of their venetian blinds, hoping to make their dimly-lit ceiling sconces work harder- what a rip-off! From hearing about Red Robin, I thought my experiences were going to be grand, but it definitely turned out to be not so great.  Although I passed on desert for my ""birthday meal"" a few days early(thanks to higher temperatures in my region of the country and my mom's incessant need to head out to some place to cool off- well, it wasn't quite the time I was hoping to find, but it worked! We told the waitress, who then referred the case to the manager-who then said she'd handle it, but she also said that ""they don't check to compare people's waistlines"".  I'm not saying to check waistlines, but in this ever growing public, it would be in the best need to look, as what most restaurants nearby will do without discussing with others. I might tackle another meal in the near future, but I want to give them some time to fix their issues first.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-poughkeepsie-2?start=40,3.56,3.56,3.56,2.7,3.5600000000000005

Your staff uses the dirty restroom then I am sure that dirtiness carries into your back of the house.  There is toilet paper all over the floor and the trash can is overflowing. Sinks were dirty and hand towels are placed too close to sink. When it automatically roles out it gets wet touching the dirty/wet sink.

It used to be that the food the service the atmosphere, everything was great but now...DISAPPOINTING! The last two times we have come here it was awful. The last time we were here the food was awful the french onion soup came out cold not warm just COLD and when I called the waitress over to politely let her know she asked me if I was sure...why ask that? Of course I'm sure it's in my mouth lol and then after the cold soup our burgers came out. The chili burger was beyond gross it had been sitting under the heat lamp so long that the chili had become the consistency of paste at this point I bypassed the waitress and went directly to the manager. When the manager came to the table to look at the burger the look on her face was nothing short of appalled and embarrassed. I will say the manager was apologetic and did have the burger remade and delivered it to the table herself but it was still a disappointing experience. So tonight we went back in an effort for redemption but another FAIL. When we sat the waitress came to take out drink order and at the same time we ordered pretzel bites and chili con queso dip (our 2 usuals) after a 25 minute wait we questioned were our apps were and the waitress headed back to the kitchen and after almost 10 additional minutes she came back to let us know that the cooks never prepared them mind but would start now...you it wasn't crowded at all we were there at 5:10pm. Once again, she was apologetic which was nice of her and while we appreciated her apology it was still disappointing and frustrating situation. After that the burgers came out and 2 of the 3 were okay but the 3rd was cold and definitely over done and all of the fries were cold and soggy.

The burger was the best I have had outside of ones I have prepared myself.  The flavor was new and delicious, I think what set it off was the bacon crumble aoli.  Fries were tasty and properly seasoned and the sweet tea was done right. I was going to order more of the bottomless fries but went with dessert instead.  The dessert I choose was the dunking donuts... Hot fresh fried dough with a berry sauce and a chocolate sauce... it was Yummy... At the end of it we had six people order burgers and desserts as well as desserts (and a few beers) and the total bill was 120$.  Not bad for a graduation party between family. BTW... bathrooms were clean and the waitress was excellent... I highly recommend it",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-poughkeepsie-2?start=20,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006
9,Marc H.,"Wappingers Falls, NY",100,50,249.0,2.0,2016-08-14,"I went here the other day after running an errand - I was hungry and looking for a convenient stop. Bingo! I entered and was greeted by a smiling hostess who sat us immediately. To a table. I then requested a booth, no problem she said, and was led to a booth that made my 220 lbs feel compressed. I then waited for the waitress to come and requested a bigger booth - Again no problems. We gave a drink order and I ordered a big beer. It came soon enough and we ordered. I was content up to this point. The food seemed to take quite a while to come and I had finished 3/4 of my beer when it arrived. The waitress asked if I wanted a refill as she dropped the food off to which I replied in the affirmative. That was the last I saw of her until I was done with my meal. My beer never came, and she never came back to make sure we had everything we needed. I was never offered more fries (they advertise unlimited) and nothing to wet my whistle as I ate. When she finally did return to clear the table I requested my check. She informed me I could pay via the mini kiosk on the table. She left then came back lime 59 seconds later saying my beer just came up from the bar, and did I want it. Uh, no I do not. Then I had to wait while the bill was adjusted because I was charged for the 2nd beer.  The food was mediocre and I certainly wouldnt consider it a ""gourmet burger"". I hated to leave a shitty tip, but my bill was almost $40.00 for a mediocre meal and bad service. Usually I will overlook less than perfect food when the tip is concerned, but the bad service couldnt be excused. (There were 2 of us.) I think I'll scratch this place off my list of ""can eats"". There are FAR too many places to eat in this area to be a repeat customer at somewhere like this...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-poughkeepsie-2,3.2,3.2,3.2,,3.2000000000000006

42,Lisa D.,"Carmel, NY",2,53,13.0,2.0,2016-10-22,"While the food (burgers and steak fries) was decent, this restaurant was a chaotic mess during our visit.  It seems like Red Robin is THE place in Poughkeepsie to take your screaming three-year-olds for lunch at 2:30 on a Saturday afternoon.  Service was excruciatingly slow even after the room cleared out a little--we waited almost half an hour for our 'tower of donuts' dessert to be delivered to our table (so long that the manager ended up comping them for us without us asking).  My husband was also disappointed that his strawberry malt had no malt flavor whatsoever.

14,Karensa M.,"Middletown, NY",71,31,4.0,4.0,2016-11-28,I travel from Middletown to Poughkeepsie at least once a month to go to Red Robin to get a good burger and bottomless fries. This restaurant is very clean and the staff is very friendly. I always get the burger that is on special. The price is unbeatable because you get a DELICOUS burger and unlimited fries for just $6.99. The only reason why I gave this restaurant '4 stars' instead of '5' is because sometimes the service is very slow. But I promise you it is always worth the wait. I always leave this restaurant smiling and full.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-poughkeepsie-2,3.24,3.24,3.24,,3.2400000000000007

I like how they pair the burgers with the beer, I'm not a drinker but if I ever care to drink this is helpful. Their cocktails are sometimes interesting also.
