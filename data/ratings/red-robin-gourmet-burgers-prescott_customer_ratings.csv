52,Elizabeth C.,"Waddy, KY",20,260,585.0,3.0,2012-10-22,Had been here before a couple times years back... Atmosphere is always lively and fun.  My BBQ Burger was great.   However.. hubby ordered the Tavern Double and it was not as advertised.  Instead of 2 full burger patties they just cut one in half and give you two super thin patties.  The burger was seriously smaller than a whopper and had less toppings... So.. if you love burgers it's worth a shot... but... meh!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-prescott?start=40,2.604,2.604,2.604,2.604,2.604

She was munching on a half eaten cake sitting (covered) next to the pass. Maybe some sort of staff celebration earlier in the day? In any case, it was disgusting. She looked right at me as she licked her fingers in full view of guests. YUCK!  The worst part...several minutes later I saw her waiting on a table of fire fighters. Sure hope she washed her hands!  Aside from that absolutely disgusting display, this was a typical Red Robin. I just couldn't get over that waitress shoveling food in her mouth with her bare hands.

62,Jerry C.,"Prescott Valley, AZ",0,8,,4.0,2014-02-03,"As a rule I don't review chain restaurants and in an area where mediocrity is the standard I have found an absolute diamond in the rough. Derek  the server at Red Robin in Prescott, AZ is worth the visit, even if you don't care for good hamburgers Derek really knows how to treat the regulars and everyone is a regular to Derek. His quick wit and attention to detail are unbelievable.  He knows the menu, unlike too many ""server"" in the Prescott area and he will honestly tell you if something isn't up to par on a particular day. He is an absolute joy to have serve you. And when you leave, Derek will most often wave and say, ""see you tomorrow ."" It is refreshing to know that there is good service out there. Maybe it is just Derek's personality that make him perfect for this job but every server should be taught that a smile, listening to the customer, knowing the menu and attention to detail are the basics for food service or just come to Red Robin some night and watch Derek work. It might explain why he always receives good tips. It's like the old saying, he does this the old fashion way - he earns them.

50,Tonya M.,"Phoenix, AZ",141,220,15.0,2.0,2014-02-20,"REDDDD ROBIN....YUMMMMM Nope, not this time! We were in Prescott for the weekend and stopped in here on a whim for dinner since we were both pretty hungry. We were told there would be a 20-25 minute wait but we were more than welcome to sit in the bar area immediately.  There were a lot of available tables so we sat down and waited and waited and then we waited some more. A couple that came in quite a while after us sat down and they were greeted right away with menus and offered drinks. Finally, I made eye contact with someone and motioned for her to come over, she asked what we wanted to drink and told someone to grab us menus. At this point, the hostess is now calling our names. Since it was obvious service was going to be horrific in the bar area we had her take us to a table in the dining room.  Little did we know we were going to wait and wait and then wait some more in the dining room as well. Nothing was efficient, it was slow, exhausting and frankly a huge waste of time. I don't know if our ticket got lost or our server just didn't put our order in right away but we waited close to 50 MINUTES just to get a burger and a chicken sandwich. Keep in mind, this was after we were told he'd be right with us and after waiting for drinks and then waiting again to order.  The whole 2 hour experience was painful. The only reason I'm giving it two stars is the food came out the way we ordered it, I didn't have high hopes.  We come to Prescott a lot and will definitely not be returning to Red Robin!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-prescott?start=40,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44

70,Dana M.,"Hemet, CA",4,14,,1.0,2014-07-06,"We visited Sat. night of Rodeo Week in July. The place was crowded when we got there about 6:40 PM complete with a 3-4 year old's temper tantrum at a near by table. However, we were seated right away (table for 5) and our order was taken in good time. However, we waited over an hour for our food. By the time we got our order the restaurant was far less crowded. My husband's and my order was delivered incorrectly. His order was to be Monster style and my dish was to come with a choice of fruit salad or fries. I received neither (come to think of it the waitress didn't ask me about my choices!) When my husband questioned the waitress she quipped ""I brought what you ordered!"" She then offered to add another patty onto his burger and brought me a basket of fries. Taken aback by her confrontational  behavior,  my husband opted to simply eat his disappointing burger-Frankly, her impertinent attitude put a damper on our meal. We chose RR as a place to celebrate a family gathering. I didn't appreciate the waitress' unprofessional demeanor nor her serving style of constantly reaching across the table instead of going to each person at the table to serve or collect plates and fill drinks. I have been to this store before and have usually received cheerful and efficient service. Never have we been snapped at by wait staff-furthermore we are frequent RR customers in both CA and AZ. We spent $62.00 for this experience. After we returned to our hotel, I examined the receipt and I confirmed that the waitress logged the order in wrong. My husband ordered what he gets every time. We came to RR to celebrate-instead, we got a green worm attitude.

61,Faye E.,"Fayetteville, NC",0,13,,1.0,2014-07-30,"On a mission for lunch with the kiddos (15 and 18). First restaurant we went to was packed so we decided to try Red Robin. Greeted and sat immediately. 20 MINUTES LATER a server came by to tell us another server would be with us in a minute. 10 MINUTES later said server arrived asking for our drink order and saying she couldn't take our food order because she didn't have a pen on her. Kiddo's drinks came about 8 minutes later and she took our food order. 15 minutes after ordering wine, the bartender brought it over. We had been seated for almost an hour when our food came....in shifts. My son's fries and fruit salad and my daughter's and my chicken wrap. 10 minutes later my son's sandwich came out along with my daughter's and my fries. Check was dropped quickly with the comment that she hated helping other servers because it always seemed to hurt her; I had my credit card in hand and we were out the door in about 1.5 hrs for lunch. My children hate it when I complain in restaurants so I stayed quiet. I worked in a restaurant for 9 years so I understand getting busy and I try to cut servers some slack - but this restaurant was not busy - less than half full. Food was what I would expect to order and pay half as much for at a small diner. I went online to complete their survey and apparently they don't want too many details as there is not a section for ""Comments.""

They were always a bit on the pricey side if you were dragging a few kids along. But since this was adults only we thought we try it out. We're glad we did and we'll be back. First, the service was OUTSTANDING. We didn't note the server's name for this review, sadly, as she deserves recognition. She was friendly, fast thorough and very helpful. Drink refills are free and we never once had to ask. When anyone's drink was at 1/4 full, another fresh one would just appear  with Ninja stealth right next to it. Fantastic. All the burgers we tried were top notch, delicious combinations prepared perfectly. Fries were tasty and not greasy; we had four different dipping sauces to go with them. And they were ""unlimited"". The prices here are far more moderate than in years past, too.   We had a great meal, (were completely stuffed) and took a couple small togo boxes with us. 3 meals, appetizer, beverages, tax and decent tip was under $50.  You can't beat it. - I you feel this review is Useful, Funny, or Cool, please check the boxes below.

53,Jaswant A. S.,"San Diego, CA",37,577,427.0,4.0,2015-04-27,"So we were driving about in Prescott - came for a festival that ended up being cancelled due to rain. Bummer. We were all underdressed for the cool weather so we decided to go someplace for dinner and the driver chose Red Robin because she had been craving a Red Robin burger since forever. Ok. I'm not into chains - not the kind they put on you while you work on the highway in orange jumpsuits and not the kind that distribute bland slop to the masses. But I went along with it. Nice big parking lot for this one. We were seated right away. Waitress brought us drinks right away and we ordered. I was curious about the Fiery Ghost Tavern Double with ghost pepper sauce, pepperhack cheese and fried and fresh jalapanos. I asked the waitress if it was real ghost pepper ""man vs food"" challenge kinda hot. She replied that some guy that came in earlier that day could only eat half of it. Hmmm. Not good enough. I need statistics - how many carried away by the meat wagon in critical condition? I mean this Ghost Pepper stuff is all the rage these days - Popeyes has Ghost Pepper Wings, Wendy's has Ghost Pepper Fries, and Jack In The Box has the Blazin' Chicken Sandwich with Ghost Pepper Sauce. I'm afraid, though, that these emperors have no clothes - it's all just smoke and mirrors. What they try to market as the wild and dangerous culinary equivalent of skydiving is actually just a wimpy sauce that wouldn't even make a bedwetting four-year-old break a sweat. So I get my ""Fiery Ghost"" burger and bite into it and my suspicions were confirmed.  I imagine someone in the legal department probably put down his cigar for a second and shouted ""We can't kill off our customers - that would be bad for business!"" So they came up with a rule that every Fiery Ghost sandwich would get exactly one drop of the ghost pepper sauce spread throughout the entire burger. You can taste the ghost pepper but it won't bite back - it's safe for the masses. Don't get me wrong - it wasn't a bad burger but just call it a regular burger with added traces of spice. So the waitress came back and asked if I wanted any dessert. Usually the answer is no. This time I was curious - I drink Blue Moon often - you know, the one with a slice of orange in it? Well these guys make a Blue Moon shake. I couldn't decided if that really sounded good or not but I just HAD to try it. So I tried it and it was actually really good. Much better than I imagined. The actual proportion of Blue Moon seemed very little - just so you get the flavor but most of it was milkshake and there was also some Cointreau in it. You won't get drunk off this though, lol. Since it is a tasty shake exclusive to Red Robin I'll probably be back again to a Red Robin somewhere once in a blue moon for a Blue Moon Shake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-prescott?start=40,2.512,2.512,2.512,2.512,2.5120000000000005

Neither of us felt like cooking and of course the inevitable question ""what do you feel like eating"" came up again - and, I might add, hard as ever to answer.  We happened to be just leaving the mall from as side entrance we seldom use and the ""Red Robin"" sign caught our eye. It's situated in one of those odd little corner lots, kind of off by itself. We have driven past it hundreds of times on the main thoroughfare, Highway 69, without ever paying it any attention. What the heck. Let's do it. The meet, greet, and seat was fast, efficient, and friendly. We were met at the door by a hostess, who quickly showed us to a table and seated us. Our friendly server appeared at our table within a minute. Drinks arrived fairly quickly and we made our dinner order of fish and chips. The food arrived within a reasonable timeframe. Piping hot and cooked to perfection. These were not the standard fare frozen, formed pieces of of fish - all the same size and shape. Instead, there were four chunks of fish, freshly battered and fried to a golden brown. Not greasy, no after taste. Very nice. The fries were also a cut above. At $14.99, a bit pricey for fish and chips, but in my opinion, well worth it.  We left there happy with our choices and very satisfied with the service and quality of the food. We will go back there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-prescott?start=20,2.92,2.92,2.92,2.324,2.92

The food was good, as expected (which is the only reason I gave the 2nd star), but the service was almost non-existent. Once we were seated, we waited almost 15 minutes before they asked for our drink order. By then, we had read the menu thoroughly and repeatedly, so we placed our food order as well. Drinks showed up a bit later, but it was half an hour before we saw food! And, speaking of drinks... Refills are unlimited at Red Robin, but only if you can get one. We were there for an hour and I managed to get one refill. I did manage to get a second in a to-go cup as we left. The staff was friendly when we saw them. We just didn't see much of them.
