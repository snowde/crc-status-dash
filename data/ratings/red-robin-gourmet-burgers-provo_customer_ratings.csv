If i need a burger or fries fix, I tend to choose this palce over many other burger joints, because it's cheap, its fast, it's friendly, and the bottomless fries are hard to pass. Lots of different types of burgers, and sandwiches, are an attractive element to this place, as you can come and always try something new. I've tried most of the burgers, and I must say I think I like the royale best. Go getcha sum mmm mmmm goood beeerger thurrr...

So, even though we thought we probably wouldn't ever go back again, here we were. Learning from our mistakes however, we avoided the Friday night rush and the ciabatta bread. I got the burnin' love burger with a raspberry lemonade (which was surprisingly good). I still think the portion sizes are a too big -- I always walk out feeling like a whale and I don't want to drive home, but my wife makes me. Anyway it's not like the burgers make for good leftovers, so what you don't finish gets thrown away, and I hate throwing away food, so it's always a dilemma (idk, maybe that doesn't make sense to anyone).

You used to be able to order a milkshake AND also get the leftover in a tin can for $3. It's now been raised to $4.50.  My real complaint, though, is that I recently ordered the Red's Tavern Double. The menu says it's made of ""classic-sized"" patties. I took that to mean Red Robin classic size. Nope! Their Tavern Double is as small as McDonald's double cheeseburger...except you're paying 3 times the amount. My burger was literally less than half the size of everyone else's at the table.

I think the food is great, affordable, and it's probably one of my favorite places to eat. I have noticed that some of the reviews mention the servers being stingy with fries. I think a lot of us in our jobs tend to get put out and annoyed by things just because they become monotonous and we get sick of doing them every day. I would assume that this is how bottomless fries are for Red Robin servers. That being said, if you're tired of getting fries for customers, don't work at Red Robin. Not one time have I asked for fries at this location and had a server say, ""sure"", or, ""yes"". It's always something to the effect of, ""I'll try"", or, ""I'll go see."" It's your job.

There were multiple tables that were empty when we sat down, but filled up shortly after. It was obvious that the other waiters cared about their tables, as they were attended to in a prompt manner.  We placed our order when our waiter brought our drinks out, and sat, and sat, and sat. All of the tables around ours received their food prior to ours, and they had ordered after we did! It literally took 25 minutes to receive our food and our waiter blamed it on the fact that my wife ordered a gluten-free item. ""It takes longer as we have to clean the spatulas, etc..."".

As this has been our experience, tonight will probably be the last time we visit this location.  I had the new überburger (that doesn't even compare to the Oktoberfest burger a few years ago) and my wife had the smoke and pepper burger - both of our sandwiches were room temperature, the fries were cool, and worst of all flavor was boring.  This has been our experience here the last few times as previously mentioned. Wait times here are atrocious, 15-20 minutes waiting to be seated, then another 22 minutes to get our cooled down food (I started a timer on my phone the moment we placed the order).  Two times ago we actually watched other people get seated, order food, get their food, and one table finished before our food came (we had a different waiter than the tables we were watching).

Or for fries while you wait for your food, they make it a huge fuss every time and tell you some excuse like ""our kitchen is behind today"" or ""I can see what I can do"" aka they will maybe bring you a basket with 10 fries to split. And they are usually slow about bringing them out. People come for the fries. If they were smart, they would be prepared with extra fries. I have been to 6 or 7 different red robins and have never had a problem.  I had gotten a bacon cheese burger with guacamole and asked for no tomato or lettuce. It came out with both, when I asked them to fix it they took it in the back and when they brought it back to me you could clearly tell they just took it in the back and took them off to bring back to me(against health code) and then also most of my guacamole was scraped off my burger. It's a joke there.  The only reason I give it two stars is because they have good food like all red robins. Or else I would give them 1 star.

I asked to be sat in front of a TV playing the Dodger's game. I was along and expected to be sat at a bar or a small table. Instead, they sat me at a table for four people. However, it was perfectly pointed right at a TV with the game playing. My server (I think his name was Blake) took my order, but his first question was whether the view was good. I ordered a burger with bottomless fries and root beer float. I warned him that I was planning on sticking around a while, and he had to objection to the idea. The burger was great, as always. The fries kept coming and coming, as promised. As did the root beer floats. I don't think I finished a single one without another one appearing in front of me. I cheered on my team and witnessed one of the best games I've ever seen in my life!! Blake kept coming around and asking if I wanted more food, and to see how my team was going. Not once did I feel rushed to leave. Even after I over-did my stay, the bottomless foods kept coming until I told them to stop in fear of me exploding. Whenever I think of Red Robin, I've always thought about their wonderful service. I think only once I received mediocre service, but it has otherwise been spot on and exceeded expectations.

I got the smoke and pepper burger.  It was ok, nothing great, and did not taste like pepper at all.  That was a big downer because that is what the burger was known for.  Other than that it was like what I could get at home.  The downside of this place.  Crap, way to crowded.  In the section I was in they need to pull a table.  Seriously folks, if I am at the resteraunt don't make me have to move so people and waiters can get by.  Don't make the walkways so tight that it is a tricky walk for people to walk behind me.   On another note I am not sure why we had two big plastic catsups at our table, and at the one next to us, and next to that.   Pros: Clean, nice staff.  Cons:  Food is ok, not sure if it is as good as the price, too crowded with tables.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-provo,3.12,3.12,3.12,2.544,3.1200000000000006

IT NEVER CAME. my wife was angry. so naturally we started yelling at each other. then the waiter came back spilled a malt on my bare foot. and i have some pretty big feet, mind you. i barked at the waiter and demanded a refund. he demanded pension. it was a standoff. it may as well have been high noon. i had his pension and he had refill.

They were dripping with grease and then they weren't even warm. Fries weren't fresh and tasted like they had been sitting for awhile. The worst food was the kids meal grilled chicken. My granddaughter ate a couple of pieces and said it tasted bad. We smelled it and you could obviously tell it was spoiled chicken. We had our server smell it and she agreed it smelled terrible. She brought mac and cheese as a replacement. Bad chicken can KILL YOU. It's not as simple as just getting another meal. By this time, I had pretty much had it.
