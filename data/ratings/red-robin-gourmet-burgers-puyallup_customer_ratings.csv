96,Marie M.,"Sumner, WA",790,78,,3.0,2012-01-20,"I have went to Red Robin many times and the one thing you can count on is their consistency. They have very good burgers, and endless fries. If you are not a fan of french fries you can get a side salad instead at no extra charge. There is no doubt though, for burgers the prices here are pretty high. Strawberry lemonade sure seems to be popular, and I know those type of drinks, like soda, ice tea, lemonade etc, are endless with constant refills. All of there burgers are cooked medium well ( 155 degrees ) If you want them cooked any differently, you will need to let your server know. The fish and chips are very good considering they specialize in burgers.  The restaurant is very lively and inviting with bright colors all around you. When I flew to Washington last month, I brought my grandson and daughter here for dinner. They always give each child  a child's menu with a few color crayons to use that have mazes, things to color etc. Usually they also give kids balloons upon request, In December, we were told that they had a national shortage of helium, so they were unable to give out any at that time This place seems packed each and every time we go there and if your not trying to watch your pennies, then I think you will really enjoy the place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-puyallup?start=60,2.7,2.7,2.7,2.7,2.7

Watching group after group get seated while you have three anxious kids is so frustrating. Oh yeah, its my sons birthday. Yay. The girl that seated us was less than thrilled. Our waitress on the other hand, was very nice and in a great mood. They messed up the birthday boys order as well as the other two kids orders. They neglected to tell us that they were out of oranges and just assumed apples would be fine, which they werent as my son hates apples. We shared our fries instead. My burger was on the bland side. To finish it all we had four separate bills and my party of four was the only bill that had automatic gratuity charged to it for 7.50. My husband is an extremely generous tipper and would have given her double that had it not been taken automatically. Needless to say this is a nice reminder as to why we don't frequent this place often.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-puyallup?start=100,2.5000000000000004,2.5000000000000004,2.5000000000000004,2.5000000000000004,2.5000000000000004

I was sitting under a TV caked with dust.  Gross Red Robin delivers a surprisingly a-ok experience, but falls short when you view the limited menu with prices on the high side.  The Burgers are sloppy, and drips from the sides of the bun and can be difficult to eat, however very tasty.  The steak fries are large, and with dipping sauce can taste great. The sevice was average, but edged on the extremely better side of average. The gourmet burgers are just that an upper level burgers you will not find at most burger establishments.

So my girlfriend and I went in and let them try to pass the test, lol.  Well, long story short, we've been back multiple times. We pretty much only go to the bar and while there have been a few 3 star visits, overall, we prefer it over most places in the area.

I however... will keep in mnd for next time that Red Robin has quite a handful of kids dining in, so it was really loud and annoying. I ordered the Chicken Bruschetta Burger? My mom and sister shared the Veggie Burger? It was my first time trying the Chicken Bruschetta and I have to say, the bread was delicious! The chicken was chicken breast but it wasn't dry and tough!(: However, the salsa that comes inside had diced tomatoes and I asked our waitress to put it on the side but she forgot I think. I was a bit disappointed since tomatoes are somewhat disgusting to eat. However, I put some ketchup on my chicken breast and tasted sp much better. I love their fries! Yum yum yum. No need to talk on and on about the fries everyone comes to love. I tried the St. Louis Pie? With strawberries and honestly, it looked unappetizing. But dang, it tasted quite good!

So I was excited when I visited family, and we decided to head over to Red Robin for dinner. Yum! We were immediately seated when we got there, no wait. The server was very nice, making little suggestions such as closing the blinds if needed. Not always typical. Service was average on the other hand. Our server took our drinks, and asked my mom if she wanted sweetener for her tea. She asked for sugar. Drinks are brought out, no sweetener. We then had to track someone down to bring it. We then ordered. We requested the appetizer onion rings. They came, and we weren't given any napkins or silverware. We had to track someone down for a second time to bring it. Gets pretty annoying having to ask for things in a sit down establishment that should be automatic or brought the first time. My baby was also in a sling with her car seat, and was bumped twice by servers. I really didn't want her woken up. The food was good as always.

87,Gina S.,"Puyallup, WA",4,12,,2.0,2015-01-03,"I hadn't been to this location in a while, since it always seems to have a waiting list at normal meal times.  But, it was nearby and I was craving a banzai burger, and I actually found a parking spot. Our party of three was seated fairly quickly, although they seemed a bit reluctant to seat us when I said the third member of our party was five minutes behind us. Really? This was my first visit since their remodel. Not impressed. If I want to sit in an uncomfortable booth with people all around me and no kind of sound barriers, I will eat at the local hospital cafeteria.  Our server was the best part of the experience. She was attentive, refilled our drinks, offered ranch for our fries, etc. The food was a little slow to arrive, but with drinks and a football game on, we managed. Now for the food. My son's meal of clucks and shrimp was one cluck shy of being just a cluck. I have never seen two smaller chicken strips at a restaurant. No seriously, these things could go to duel with a fishstick and lose. The shrimps were okay, but with about six on the plate, it left the proteins severely underrepresented.  He even ate the coleslaw, just to try to feel full.  My burger was delicious. I am not complaining about quality, just quantity. If it wasn't for the bottomless fries, I would have complained. But I don't find value in being filled up with fried cheap carbs.  When I pay $50 plus a tip for three people, I want to walk away feeling good about it.

No host was at the front to have us seated. Another party of two males walk in.. The host walks out from the corner and instead of being courteous and asking who arrived first, she automatically took the two guys to go get seated. My blood boiled.. Because excuse me honey, we live in this country where racism still exists.. How do you think it looks (professionally, culturally, and sociologically) if your white ass seats white boys before brown people?! I was so irritated by the lack of courtesy and professionalism. Those two boys could have said something too. I was too shocked to have experienced this for the first time.. So I bit my tongue. I would have given this place less stars if it wasn't for one of the best customer service I have ever received from the waitor. He was so exceptional!! It reminded me of like southern hospitality.. He took our order, referred to me as ma'am and my boyfriend as sir, checked back on us to see if we needed anything else and if the food was cooked to perfection, served us bottomless fries without asking... He was just so great!!  Our burgers were cooked to perfection! I swear, I looked at my boyfriend's burger when Ryan placed it down, then I looked at my food.. Took a bite of fries.. And when I looked back at my boyfriend.. Half of his burger was gone LOL it was that ""yummmm""  Before leaving, I wrote down comments about the host and our waitor (Ryan) on the back of a receipt..

52,Adri M.,"Puyallup, WA",7,8,9.0,2.0,2015-05-14,"This last Saturday, after a fun day at the beach I was craving Red Robbin. I figured it wouldn't be too busy around 8:30 so we headed in. It wasn't too packed in there so we thought we had lucked out. We were told it would be a 20-25 minute wait to be seated. My 5 year old was with me or we would have opted for the bar. I was shocked and asked why. The hostess said they were short servers and only had 4 servers at the time. I should have listened to my gut and went to BJ's next door. We only waited about 10 minutes for a seat. We knew what we wanted already, so we ordered everything as soon as we saw our waitress Ashley, which was only a few minutes after sitting down. I still had high hopes. We waited 25 minutes for our beverages. With a thirsty 5 year old. I gave him my phone after 15 minutes to buy some peace. The manager saw us and guiltily brought over a basket of fries. Still nothing to drink. Finally our appetizer came out and still no drinks. I had to ask our poor waitress again just for water. There were 3 of us, but only 2 waters. My drink that I ordered was a lemon drop. It was awful and I should have asked for a better vodka but I didn't. Seriously gross. I didn't complain about it because it's their choice to use cheap crappy vodka and I should have asked. My husband ordered the clam chowder. It was half full and dry, as though it was the bottom of the pot. We did ask for it to be taken off. The burger and fries were amazing and thank goodness for that. Watching our waitress literally run, work her butt off and do it with a smile was impressive. Ashley was amazing and the order issues and drink problems were from lack of staff. I'm shocked that her manager let the staff go on a Saturday night. I could tell as he waited on tables he knew he made a bad decision. Yes, one that ruined several people's dining experience. On a sunny Washington Saturday, it's going to be slow until the sun goes down. It doesn't mean cut your staff. Was saving money worth a bad yelp review?

I ordered the a1 peppercorn burger with a side of the bacon sauce the waitress brought out our food and my sauce was wrong song let her know and she went back and brought me back the same sauce I already had. She said the cooks didn't know what sauce I was talking about. I showed her a picture in the menu and she took it back again waited about 6 minutes before she came back with the right sauce. Then after taking a couple bites of my burger I tasted paper.. I spit out what was in my mouth and sure enough some paper.. I took apart the half of my burger I had left and the cook left the paper on the cheese.. There were black burn marks in the edges of it.. I was pissed..

She came back with chips salsa and guacamole(in which I'm very allergic to)we told her we had ordered fries and was so upset she cut us off and said""apologize I'll get the fries"" and left in a huff. Finally after watching her have such a hard time imputing our order she came back and brought our fries STACKED on top of each other.. these are the baskets that they place on the counters on tables and where they hold them to serve..she stacked them on the fresh fries (gross) by this time I was to hungry to care I ate them anyways. So we finished the bottomless fries and a few sodas and she was in the back trying to figure out what was going on with the order and since we could see what she was putting in we knew she had the order wrong...well we pushed the call button  no one ever came back we figured she was so frustrated at everything maybe she quit???

I was not happy with the fact that they do not have Tabasco sauce. What burger joint doesn't have Tabasco sauce?? Good thing I carry some in my bag (swag). As for the prices; I honestly feel like they nickel and dime you for everything. They have special sauces that come in an extremely small single serve cup for .75 which is not practical at all. They have games on the table tablets, but your going to pay $1.99 per. Over prices appetizers for such a small portion.  I recommend the Blu Ribbon Burger with a turkey burger, instead of beef. Ps: you can sub turkey, chicken, or veggie burgers for all burgers. No extra cost :)  Also: I've been to other Red Robins before, and by far this one gave the smallest portion of ""bottomless"" fries.

However, my grandma and aunt wanted to do Mom's Day lunch here, so I reluctantly obliged. It's kind of unfair of me to give a review of the service here - my uncle is one of the managers and he waited on us, and my cousin is one of the bus boys. So, I mean, I think the service is fantastic and you're lucky to have either Christian or Scott working with you. ;)  I ended up getting the Avo Cobb O salad - avocado, grilled chicken breast, and bacon. It was pretty tasty and the chicken was really good, but I only had a few pieces of avocado. With its name having to do with avocado, I thought I'd get more  (and I'm an avocado fiend). I also tried the Raspberry Cream Soda and it was DELICIOUS but pretty sweet so I was only able to have one. Fried pickles are delicious as well.

In the hour that the four of us were there we were never offered refills on our drinks and the three dirty tables next to us never got bussed. It was about 4 p.m. and not very busy.

I think to my self...don't touch anything..go straight to your table. They just opened but there are gobs of shoe prints on the tile floor...like someone is moping with old mop water.

Our server was Katie M.  and she was very patient with us.  I had asked if the promotion that we received emails about for Royalty members of spend $10 get a free appetizer was limited.  She informed us it was not, it included any appetizer.  This only prolonged our decision but we finally decided on ordering nachos, and boneless wings in addition to my Royal Red Robin burger and my wife's fish and chips.  After placing our order, we sat over 20 minutes with still no appetizers. The manager had noticed my wife's displeasure and came over to ask if everything was ok.  She told him NO I'M hungry and we still don't have our appetizers.  He said he'd look into it. He went back to the kitchen. A few minutes later he came back with our appetizers and apologized.  Immediately afterward he came back with our entrees.  We hadn't even started to eat the appetizers yet! He again apologized and said there was a bit of mix up in the kitchen so everything came out at once.  The manager said he'd take them back to the kitchen and have some new ones made up but brought out after a little while so we'd have a chance to eat the appetizers without the entrees getting cold.  He came back and check on us after we got out entrees.   I'd have to say this is the first Red Robin were I've seen the manager actually working the floor during peek hours and ensuring guests are having a good experience.
