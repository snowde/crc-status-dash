71,Alisa N.,"Gilbert, AZ",0,4,,1.0,2016-07-30,"I know it's only been maybe 2 weeks since its been open but the staff seems to be ill prepared and the manager didn't come across as management material.  The first thing I noticed is the restaurant is so uncomfortably small. For how busy this particular area is, it makes no sense as to why it was built so small. My mom and I waited maybe 10 minutes, were misinformed about the first come first serve seating in the bar. We sat at a dirty table hoping to have it cleaned and the servers, busters, and manager looked as us like they were confused. So we got up and as we were walking out a hostess rudely said ""mark them as a walkout"" before we made our way to the door.  I've worked in restaurants and that was not a good representation of good customer service. When we decide to go to Red Robin again, we'll choose to drive the 15+ minutes to the San Tan or other locations.

One thing we didn't like is we were seated next to a family that had a baby in a car seat which was sitting between our tables and the mother went between 3-4times rubbing against our table. When there were two other tables that we could have sat at and had more room and not bothered them or them bother us.

33,Terry H.,"Florence, AZ",53,19,48.0,4.0,2016-08-14,"Red Robin is now in Queen Creek. It's nice to have it close to home and have yet another dining option. I had the Banzai burger. Pineapple, teriyaki sauce, tomato, onion and mayo. Lesson learned there as the tomato and mayo kind of overwhelmed the flavors I wanted to taste but that's on me for not thinking about withholding those toppings. Made the burger really messy. It was good though. Cassandra had the Royal Robin which looked stacked! The wings with chips was really good as were the pretzel bites. The kids ate all of their food, mini corn dogs and pizza. The beers are HUGE! And not badly priced, about 6.50 a piece. Service was great although we had to ask for napkins twice. Not a big deal. About 65 dollars for 4 people. Not bad at all. Will be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-queen-creek?start=20,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997,2.6399999999999997
69,Nichelle G.,"Queen Creek, AZ",0,3,,1.0,2016-08-19,"Came here with my husband and kids and was not impressed. We waited for quite awhile for our food to show up and once it arrived it was very disappointing. I ordered the whiskey river burger which I've had before at have loved but the one I got here had barely any fried onion straws or bbq sauce on it. It tasted like a greasy over priced cheeseburger. Not only that but I was given a drink I never ordered and I had to ask a few different times to have it removed from my bill. For my husband food which was pretty plain, my unsatisfactory meal, and a simple kids meal and fruit cup it somehow came to $35 for less than mediocre food. The place was nearly empty when we were done with our meal and it took nearly 10 mins after we finished eating for our waiter to come and even see if we needed anything else. By this point our kids were fussy and so my husband took the kids out to the car while I waited for even longer just to have the waiter come back around again so I could ask for the check. Once I was finally able to ask for our check (since I was paying cash and couldn't do it on their little monitors) it then took the waiter ANOTHER 10+ minutes of me sitting in my booth alone with my cash visibly in hand watching him just stand around talking to other workers. By this point I'm already fed up with the whole experience already and see that the drink I never ordered still had not been removed from my check. I was so upset that when he finally came back to my table I just handed him my cash and walked out with out even waiting for a receipt because who knows how long that would've taken just to get a piece of paper back. I wish I did stay to get a receipt just to be able to call corporate or the manager here to file an complaint which is something I've actually never done before with a restaurant but this experience was so bad that I wish I did.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-queen-creek?start=60,2.244,2.244,2.244,2.244,2.2440000000000007

23,Mike L.,"Queen Creek, AZ",28,10,,1.0,2016-09-12,"Went to the QC Red Robin tonight for the 2nd time, both times were substandard!  The wait staff were more interested in their own personal lives than waiting on the customers.  I'd love to tell you how the chips and queso were but they never showed up!  The garlic fries cost extra, a small detail the waitress left out when asking which fries I wanted with my dinner. I've been to other Red Robin locations and the one in the QC is very poorly run.  They might as well start packing up for the closure now.  They've just been added to the list of Queen Creek mediocre restaurants, which unfortunately number in the majority.

They have veggie and vegan burgers!!!! :) Any burger can be  made with the vegetarian or vegan patty at no extra charge. Didnt try is but saw it on the menu that they can also lettuce wrap your burger or have a gluten bun as well. Bottomless fries !!!! Staff were all smiles and very friendly. Now the bad~ Service was super slow...... #1-They tell us it will be a 20 minute wait....after 30 minutes and several other groups who were seated before us who came after us, I went to the hostess to inquire about our table and she said our table has been assigned they are just waiting to clear it off....10 minutes later.....we are shown our table. I kid you not !! #2-Our waiter was friendly , wayyyy to friendly, but just not to us. She was talking to every table around us way too long. It took her over 10 minutes before she asked us what we wanted to drink, I dont even think she introduced herself. Food even came to our table after a bigger party who sat down after and ordered after ours and they received their food before us. We only had a party of 3!!! She never even refilled our drinks, we had to ask and even at that moment it took forever !!! #3-Now its time to get our check, because we are done. Done with our food. Done with the restaurant. Done with the day, and our waitress is no where to be found. Waiting, waiting...15 minutes go by...she surfaces...but goes to another table and starts socializing....""you have got to be kidding me, wheres the hidden camera"" type of moment. So I really dont like to be rude so I didnt interrupt so about 10 minutes later she is done talking and starts to head back to the kitchen ...ummmm no...we are ready to check out...excuse miss ....we would like to cash out...please...she leaves and at this moment, she quickly  brings back the check (as if these last moments she is trying to make her last impressions before we give her a tip...trying to make up for the entire night ), I dont let her leave and I quickly give her my card and she takes off....re surfaces and we immediately leave.  My family gave our name at 7:50pm, we were walking out the door at 10 pm. All we really wanted to do was a grab a quick bite, thats why we didnt head to the valley because we were all tired from a busy work day/week.

Now they make their buildings so small and cram so many tables right next to each other that it is very uncomfortable (physically and mentally).

Our third attempt at happily giving this place our money has ended just like the first two. And it's not busy enough to warrant this. We love the food, normally. But the service is so horrible.

It was the clam chowder, which they've either modified their recipe or don't order late in the evening because it was clam water - They did take them off our bill, so I'll give them credit for that - The server never came and asked how our meal was We've come three times.
