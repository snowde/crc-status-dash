The vegetarians I suppose but I will not count them for this review. The Red Robin always does a good burger and the unlimited french fries are wonderful, though the basket that comes with your food is often cold, you just have to order a new basket and they come out piping hot, I usually do not even bother with the ones that come with the burger. Speaking of burgers, the Royal Robin is my favorite, love the fried egg on there.

Now that my family moved to this area, I decided to give this location a try and was a little disappointed.  Happy hour: 3-6pm, 8-closing, I had the gold margarita peach favored for 3.50. Thought it was quite yummy. Not that much alcohol in it, pretty fruity and goes well with greasy food. Service: pretty good I must say. They have a good tables/server ratio so our server was very attentive. Food: okayyy. I believe the one in San Dimas has fresher fries and more flavorful burgers. We had Bacon cheeseburger (3 stars), chophouse burger (4 stars), steak fries that comes with the meal (2 stars) and one upgraded sweet potato fries (4 stars) for $1.39. Both fries are bottomless, load up with starch my fellow yelpers! I really like the fries with the honey mustard too!!!

Gave us ranch, more fries and refills before we can even ask.  But now that I got that out the way, onto the food. I love that they have a vegan burger on the menu. It sucks that you can only get it by switching it with another patty but it is still good. I would hope in the future they would just make it more simple and just put a vegan burger on the menu where u don't have to keep substituting things in and out of the burger. It makes it easier for the customer, waiter, and the chef and causes less mistakes. I have sometimes have asked for a bacon guacamole burger with a vegan patty instead, no bacon, no cheese, no mayo, and can you switch the bread?

We waited approximately 20 minutes and our appetizer arrived after our entree.  I tried to flag a waiter down since there weren't any forks or napkins on our desk, but there weren't any on the floor.  So we waited a few more minutes for that.   All in all the food is decent, not worth coming back for.  The service is lousy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rancho-cucamonga?start=320,3.4,3.4,3.4,2.7600000000000007,3.4000000000000004

330,Leah G.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",0,6,,2.0,2013-07-23,"I have come here countless times with my family, and my opinion of this place has never really changed: nothing to rave about. I do t know how many times I have been here and something has gone wrong. Some people might say ""then don't go there anymore."" But it's a place my family enjoys regardless of my opinions.  Our most recent visit, we arrived about 10 minutes after they opened, and we were asked to wait for 10 more minutes, while they set up and ""assigned stations"". In my opinion, if you say you open at 11, you are open, and ready to seat customers as soon as the clock hits 11. Then, we were seated, and out server came right away. Redemption. Not quite. As one member of our party ordered Diet Coke and two others ordered Coke, he brought the drinks, and set them down. As soon as the person who ordered diet took a sip, she wasn't sure if it was diet or regular. So after tasting, we decided he had switched a diet with a regular, and left us guessing which was which. Then our order came out and he placed it on the table. Red Robin is famous for their gourmet burgers. They also have a large presentation on their menu on options of ""trade this for that"" ""make it your own"" so I take advantage of it. I usually order a burger that comes on an onion bun, and has Dijon sauce on it, but I always ask them to switch the bun for a sesame seed bun and to not put the sauce on. When the order arrived, the server put down the plate and said ""here is your burger on a sesame seed bun!"" When it clearly was not on a sesame seed bun. They did not put the sauce, like I asked, but the didn't put the other sauce that comes on it either. Their staff could be a little more aware of orders, and how they're prepared. If I were a server, I would be embarrassed to serve someone the incorrect thing, and to say it is what they ordered, when it was clearly not.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rancho-cucamonga?start=340,3.36,3.36,3.36,2.6960000000000006,3.3600000000000003

We ordered the tower of onion rings and he brought them out but did not supply us with plates. Our waiter had to either leave or go on break, so he brought over ""Allison"". She was just all over the place. She brought our food but did not supply spoons for the kids mac and cheese. She spilled the ranch everywhere and never brought our refills. Finally she brings our check and my total is $46. & change. I Tip her 2 bucks for the horrible service and go on my way. On Tuesday morning I check my account and the payment posted as $54. And change. At that point I call them and speak to the manger and he told me that I tiped the waiter $8.00 on my credit card slip (which stupid me never writes 0) in other words she wrote $8 as a tip totaling $10 with the cash tip I left!

Some guy ended up bringing us our food, then Cruella returned with her frowny face to bring our bill without asking us if we would like dessert, at this point I didn't even want dessert anymore.

The chili I ordered as the side was better than the burger but there wasn't much of that either.

Let that soak in your mind real quick: ENDLESS. GARLIC. FRENCH. FRIES. Gourmet Cheeseburger ($9.49) The burger is super simple. That doesn't mean the burgers are plain by any means.

198,Kate H.,"Auburn, WA",185,900,77.0,3.0,2015-01-20,"I guess I visited here when things just couldn't go right. It was pretty crowded, so we decided to go to the bar, where there is open seating. There were some seats together at the bar, but they were at a low bar and were in a high traffic area, so we went to the higher section of the bar, where we couldn't find two seats together. So, we settled into a booth in the bar, where the manager promptly told us that the booths in the bar were not available to us. He found a high-top table that worked for us. Fourth time's a charm, I guess. After we FINALLY found seating, it took forever for the server to get to us to take our order or even get us water. I ordered a burger without a bun and a side caesar salad. She brought the salad out first, which was very nice. But, she didn't bring any silverware. It took so long for her to get us silverware that I decided to eat the salad with my fingers. Hey, you've got to do what you've got to do. They were a little heavy-handed on the salad dressing, so I couldn't eat it. When my burger came out, it had a leaf of lettuce underneath it that was actually rotting and they put my burger in a basket. I guess they thought I was going to eat a meat patty with my fingers, too. I had to ask for a plate. Also, there were fries as my side with the burger. So, she had charged me for a caesar salad instead of substituting it as my side. My dining partner always gets his burger lettuce wrapped. Other Red Robins wrap theirs in iceberg lettuce, but this Red Robin wraps in Romaine ?!?!? It was awkward. So, we had a free burger on our rewards card, but we didn't want to use it. Our server said we had to use it or not use our rewards card for the purchase, which is a weird system. But, oh well.  Anyway, it's a very inconsistent experience than I've had at other Red Robins.

186,Mike P.,"Upland, CA",4,80,3.0,3.0,2015-03-02,"Ok, I am reviewing Red Robin again. After my first review, I was contacted by a Red Robin Regional Manager who apologized for the bad service, sent me a gift card and suggested that I give the Rancho Cucamonga location another try. For this, I say ""Thank you Red Robin for taking the time to follow up on your bad Yelp reviews"".  This is really what spurred me to being writing reviews. That and we want to share some of the really good places we have visited. After some time, my wife and I decided to try Red Robin again. We went back to the Rancho location as we were in the mood to ""pig out"" and relax.  We tried the Towering Onion Rings, as we are big fans of really good onion rings and we were not disappointed. They were great! For dinner we wanted to try the Tavern Double Burger with unlimited steak fries. The burgers were delicious but a bit on the small side. Thus the price of $6.99. We did have several orders of the delicious steak fries, although the wait was a little on the long side for them. Over all, the food was really, really good. We enjoyed it. It was what we came here to have and enjoy. We did find their beer list a bit on the limited side. We don't drink, Coors, Bud, Miller, ect and prefer beer with some taste like those of a good Micro Brew. Blue Moon and Sam Adams will suffice, but we are really looking for more taste.  We started out in the bar as Red Robin was fairly busy at 6pm on a Saturday evening.  The bar service was good as we watched the hockey game while waiting for our table. We were shown to our table about 30 min later where we had adequate service. Nothing out of the ordinary, but nothing special either. There were many, many empty tables and thought we could have been seated earlier, but who knows. Customer service is a BIG issue with us. We did not have any major problems, like before, but we do find Red Robin to be a bit on the loud side. For the type of family restaurant that Red Robin is, I am not surprised but would have liked to not to have yell my conversation at my wife. Would I return to Red Robin...........yeah I think I will.

Such a hard and kind worker. I never had to ask for a refill. She checked on the food for us. The service was honestly the best I've had from any restaurant. Also, the burger was fantastic!!!!!! I got the whiskey bleu cheese burger. Keep in mind that I do not like bleu cheese very much, but I fell in love with this burger. Plus the bottomless garlic fries (99 cents more) were delicious. I could barely finish I second basket. When I did ask for the second basket I received it almost immediately. Overall, I do not have one complaint about this visit today (I complain a lot).

190,Michael S.,"San Bernardino, CA",5,121,69.0,5.0,2015-04-20,"I cant help it... I LOVE Red Robin. We always start out with the Buffalo Wings... Red Robin has my favorite Buffalo Wings. Maybe about a year or so ago (maybe longer) they started serving them on a bed of potato chips... and my wife and I LOVE this. There is nothing better than a crunchy potato chip with buffalo sauce on it! So much more satisfying than the standard carrots and celery. We always get a little extra buffalo sauce on the side as well...  As for the burger, I keep it simple. I've ventured out and tried a few different things, and I always come back to the original... the Gourmet Cheeseburger. I'm kind of particular about my cheeseburgers, so I don't really care for too much frill... So, I order the Gourmet, monster (2 patties), with American cheese (because nothing melts like American cheese), and I hold the onion, tomato and relish. It is pretty darn close to the perfect burger... it is fantastic... every... time. Lately, my wife and I end up eating in the bar. We either belly up to the bar or we sit in one of the booths in the bar. We don't like the high tops in the bar because quite frankly they are just TOO close together. They may as well have one long cafeteria style table and let people pull up a chair, because you're all sitting shoulder to shoulder anyhow.  Aside from that, we like the bar area because Helen is usually working, and she is awesome. We hope that they keep her where she is and give her a raise... because it would be a shame to lose service that good to management. She always has an awesome attitude and just provides excellent, attentive service every time. We dont always get her as our server unless we belly up, but we always get great service when we do.   There is a gentleman (who's name I don't know) who is often serving in the bar area. As far as attitude goes... he's an A+ all the way, but unfortunately, its also his downfall... he spends so much time talking to the customers that the service ends up being slow and the food/drinks take longer to get. Overall, however, I give RR in Rancho 5 stars... I love it here. Its a casual atmosphere where you can get an awesome burger and wings.  Honestly, I went to Slater's 50/50 across the way ONE time. Dont get me wrong... Slater's is great. But there is no reason to wait 2 hours when you can get a delicious (and quite possibly better) burger at Red Robin and maybe wait 10 minutes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rancho-cucamonga?start=140,3.52,3.56,3.56,3.2520000000000002,3.5440000000000005

They were right on time with their wait time, which my hunger appreciated.  To start, we ordered the Spinach Dip & a cup of clam chowder. I really didn't like the chips that came with the spinach dip. They had a heavy wheat taste to them, and not the light airy salted corn chip I'm used to. The clam chowder was just OK. I wasn't given soup crackers, which I love, and I didn't bother asking for any. For my entrée, I ordered the Simply Grilled Chicken Burger which came with all the toppings on the side. I forgot to ask them to add cheese, which made me sad because I LOVE cheese, but oh well, next time! My husband ordered the Whiskey BBQ Chicken Burger and I heard no complaints. I ordered the Grilled Chicken on a Stick and a side of fruit for my son. All in all, the food was OK.  The service was EXCELLENT! I really liked our waitress. She was super attentive and nice.

Never got any utensils so child ate with her hands feeding herself.  No apologies from waitress as she never returned to our table to help our main waiter. But she was visible to be seen chatting with another staff member and checking her phone.  - I ordered a draft beer but told waiter to time it right and bring it with my meal.  I finished my meal and bar back comes over with the beer.  I send it back and refuse it.  - middle bathroom sink was clogged up with a low running faucet. No one checked on it and I shut off faucet because water was almost to the top with no draining action.  I understand it's a busy and it's a weekend but this visit was ridiculous. I'll express this on website because there's no follow up on here from any staff.  Farrell's it is.

145,Amber J.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",56,36,1.0,2.0,2015-08-18,"This past weekend my daughter and I decided to go to Red Robin because they do always have good burgers even though our prior visits the service has been mediocre. And it's extremely loud even for a family restaurant.  Well.........Red Robin didn't let me down - the service sucked again!!!! There is always a wait at this location. But luckily it was only about 10 minutes or so before we go seated at our booth. While we waited longer than usual for anyone to come to our table to get our drink order we noticed most of the tables were full. This couple across from us looked annoyed. Just from observing it looked like they were waiting for the waitress to pick up their check and process their payment.  Finally a male came to our table and knowing there would be delays I said we were ready to order. He said he wasn't a waiter and was just getting our drinks. It didn't take too long for the drinks to come back. My daughter ordered a Diet Coke and I ordered a regular ice tea. I can assume the reason some restaurants don't keep sugar/no calorie sweetener on the tables is because they are being stolen and it can get expensive. But if someone orders an unsweetened ice tea I would automatically bring the little container with the sugar/sweeteners in it, or at least ask!!!! This annoys the hell out of me. Our waitress Bunnie showed up with a smile and took our order. She was very friendly and we really liked her and it seemed she had been a waitress for a while. She knew her stuff. I always order the Bleu Ribbon burger($9.69) with steak fries and my daughter always get the Burnin' Love ($9.69) burger. This time she decided to get the sweet potato fries. Our food was taking a long time but Bunnie came back and let us know the kitchen was backed up and our food would be out shortly. They are always slow and backed up. My daughter and I talked about this while waiting for our food. I'm not sure if it's management or they are understaffed or unorganized (that was for sure, waiters had tables all over) or they don't know what they are doing.........but I guess that all boils down to management.  So the food finally comes. Our waitresses shift is over and she introduces our new waitress. I don't remember her name but she was less than enthused to be at work. At least fake that shit! My burger was good like usual. My daughter's burger was good like usual. My fries were piping hot, but the sweet potato fries were boarding cold. We couldn't see or find our waitress to let her know. It was very annoying. It seems like recently (maybe the past year, don't know) they only bring you like less than 7 fries out with your burger. REALLY?! No one ever came back to check on us or see if we wanted more fries. I had to eye the manager (who was helping on the floor, like usual- He has zero personality.) and ask for more fries even though we were already done with burgers and fries. It didn't take too long to bring those back but my daughter's sweet potato fries were freaking cold again!!!!  So we waited and waited and waited for our waitress to bring us our check(over 15 minutes). And then more waiting and waiting to get my change. The tip we left reflected her crappy waitress skills.  Why does a place that have great food have to have the WORST service???!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rancho-cucamonga?start=120,3.24,3.54,3.54,1.8960000000000001,3.420000000000001

I went here yesterday with my family because they love this place, but when we got there and got seated, first the manager took our drink orders which was no problem but when our drinks were delivered by the waitress first off, one of the drinks was wrong and secondly she (accidentally) dropped the entire glass into my lap. Surprisingly I was extremely calm about this considering she stained my white shirt and it was ridiculously sticky and all over me, but after she dropped the entire glass on me, she never came back and we had a different waiter the rest of the meal. Maybe she was embarrassed, but okay whatever.  I'm just upset that there was absolutely no compensation of any kind to make up for the waitress's slippery fingers. Nothing, at all. We all joked that maybe we should've complained a little bit more and we would've received something like a discount of some sort, anything to show their gratitude for their massive mistake into my lap.

We would have reminded our waitress to check on the chips but she was no where to be found. Our waitress didn't bring our food. Some other lady did. Our waitress took forever to check on us to see if we needed anything with our meals. Which my boyfriend needed mustard so he had to wait awhile to dig into his burger. Not once did our waitress stop by to ask us if we needed refills or how our food was. We had the bottomless fries and wanted a refill, of course waitress no where to be found. We see the manager pass by and had to ask her to bring more fries. Finally done with our meal we were going to order dessert. We were still looking and looking for our waitress, finally we see her up front talking away holding a baby! So we gave up on the dessert and our waitress finally came over and asked my dad are you paying cash or card. My dad says card and she says ""oh go ahead and pay there"" she points at the ziosk on the table and walks away. We were in disbelief how rude she was. Fed up we called the manager Caitlyn over. We explained to her how poor the service was and she genuinely apologized and charged us no fee for our dinner.

After 5 minutes of taking pictures in the lobby of the beautiful Christmas Trees we finally got our seats and met our waitress Angie. She was one of the best waitresses that we've ever experienced at a restaurant. She was always on time, she stayed ahead of everything that we requested, was super friendly and accommodating and also very funny. Now since we were celebrating a birthday Red Robin has a rewards program to treat the birthday boy or girl to free hamburger but there was a slight complication with our number in the system. Yet the manager Catherine was very accommodating and made sure we got it. On top of that the other waiters like Thomas and Max were very funny. They passed by our table just to make us laugh and enjoy our day. We really had a great time at this Red Robin. Not to mention that the food was great!

Most would be happy about this but I am allergic. So the server requested kitchen for another burger. Upon are visit it was busy yes but we asked 3 different people for a side of ranch multiple times and never received more after the first two small sides she had dropped off in the beginning are cups sat empty for too long in my opinion as well considering how often our server and other servers walked past our table. Our server was nice and friendly but just felt a bit annoyed that after forgetting so much and waiting so long for another burger that was there mistake not ours nothing was comped.

191,Michelle T.,"Victorville, CA",67,5,,5.0,2016-01-15,"Update : A few months ago, I visited this Red Robin (on foothill in Rancho Cucamonga). It was not a great experience and I left an honest review on Yelp. To my surprise, I was contacted by a representative from Red Robin and given a gift card to try the restaurant again.  So, tonight, we decided to give it a shot.  I am SO HAPPY to report that we had an awesome experience. I did not tell anyone that I had a gift card from Yelp until the very end because I wanted an honest experience. Our server Derek was amazing. Last time we had an issue with our drinks, this time Derek was so on top of it that almost as soon as our bottomless float was finished, he was ready with another. Our food came out quickly and was delicious. I had the new Bonzai salad, which was delicious. And this time, we stayed for dessert too. We loved our mud pie! I am glad that we gave it another shot, and more glad that not only did we not experience the issues we had last time, but Derek actually exceeded our expectations. Thank you Katie A for listening to us and giving us a chance to rectify our opinion.  Previous Review: I have always loved Red Robin, so please note that this review is based on my experience at the Rancho Cucamonga Red Robin.  For fairness sake, I'll state that we did arrive at 7:30 on a Saturday night, so naturally, it was busy.  However, the host sat us, and told us our server, David, would be right over. He wasn't. He showed up about 10 minutes later, took our drink orders and appetizer orders. About 20 minutes later, I flagged him down and asked about our drinks. He looked at our table in disbelief as he realized he has completely forgotten our drinks. I also took this opportunity to ask for napkins and silverware and place our dinner orders. About 5 minutes later, he appeared with the 3 root beer floats Tim and the kids had ordered, but the older 2 kids and I were just brought empty glasses. When I asked why the 3 glasses on the tray were empty, David explained he had to go make the lemonades. Seriously? Just bring me my lemonade! Meanwhile, our appetizers were being delivered. And the guy delivering our appetizers tried to take away the tray of empty glasses. He was startled when I took the tray out of his hands and explained those weren't empty, they had yet to be filled. I finished my appetizer just as my lemonade was arriving. At this point we had 3 empty bottomless rootbeer floats at the edge of the table. They were ignored.  At 9pm, we still hasn't had any drink refills, nor had our server checked in on us. We decided maybe we should just leave. In retrospect, we all agree we should have.  Instead, we flagged down our server, pointed out how many people who had come after us were down leaving and we still had no food. He went to check on the food, which he said would be 3 more minutes. He then explained that this was his first shift and he was sorry he was messing up so badly.  7 minutes later our lukewarm soggy food was delivered. My guess is had been sitting under a heat lamp for the last 30 minutes.  The manager came over to talk to us, but literally did nothing. Personally, I feel he should have at least comped our bottomless drinks which were each refilled once in an hour and a half.  We barely ate any of our very sub par food, before paying our bill and leaving only a $1 tip, which frankly, I thought was over generous given that we paid over $100 for this disaster of a meal.  My tip to Red Robin is this: servers probably shouldn't start on a Saturday night dinner rush. And if guests pay for bottomless floats or lemonades, and your staff doesn't actually deliver bottomless drinks, you shouldn't charge them for them.  And lastly, the floor managers need to be aware of what's happening on the floor. The manager should have noticed the 6 empty glasses at the edge of the table, even if the server didn't. He has to be especially aware if the server is brand new.  This trip to Red Robin definitely left us with a bad taste in our mouth, and it may be a while before we return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rancho-cucamonga?start=140,2.32,2.99,2.99,3.3800000000000003,2.7220000000000004

I've never been to a Red Robin before but have always wanted to try it out, it looks good! But after getting the run around for an hour we decided to leave. Here's what happened, we sat down and ordered our food, the peppercorn burger and Western charm, and had been talking for about half an hour before wondering where our food was. After a bit, our server came back and told us how sorry he was about the wait but it would be out soon. Another 15 minutes pass and he sends out another server to give us fries. Another 5 pass and he comes back to reassure us that it'll just be a few more minutes. At this point it was 5:50 and we got there an hour before, they must've had to slaughter the cow in the back or something... Our server came back and the same story, it'll be ready soon. At this point we were tired of sitting there for an hour and got up and left. I talked to the hostess and let her know we were leaving and to cancel the orders. I ended up going to McDonald's across the street and wish i did that from the start.  Your server screwed up and i wish he was honest. Instead of giving us the run around, he should've let us know that he forgot the order (or what ever the excuse) and it would take another 20 minutes. If that was the case, we would've gotten an appetizer! It's that simple! It really wouldn't have been a big deal, but waiting and being led on for an hour is what pissed me off.

94,Brent P.,"Riverside, CA",20,10,1.0,1.0,2016-04-02,"Review is on restaurant/service. Food was ehh....just ok. Normally I usually don't go to Red Robin because of the kid factor (not hating on kids) but we tried it out again anyways. I's not sure about other locations but this one has gone downhill. My theory is that because it is so close to Victoria Gardens and the surrounding businesses, that they don't try as hard because they know that the foot traffic will be there.  When will hostesses figure it out that people do not like to be seated near the entrance, kitchen or bathrooms. Yeah, I really want a blast of cold air whenever the front door is opened, conversation from the kitchen or the smell of farts when I'm eating. I get that you have to use all available space to maximize your seating area, but c'mon, especially when there are other available seats. If its based off of rotation of the servers then ask the customer if its ok before you walk them to the table.  When we finally got a table the waitress asked if we had been there before. We said ""yes"" and then she said ""So you know how to use our touchscreen orders?"" Um, no. She ran through it. Basically, its there to make her job easier but its portrayed as quicker service because you're doing the ordering. Main entrees are ordered through your server, but all appetizers, shakes, and alcohol are ordered through the touchscreen and are delivered by the kitchen/bar. So basically, your server is only responsible for taking your main order, bringing your main order, and refilling your soda/tea/water (which I had to ask for a refill from the barback who brought our appetizer)....so you basically never see them again. You even pay and tip through the touchscreen. And also, clean the damn thing!!! Ours had food on it and it looked like it was cleaned with a burger wrapper it had so much grease on it.

Or you can also take it to Fuddruckers by Ontario Mall, which has a self-serving condiment bar and you don't have to pay tips. The only pros of Red Robin's is the unlimited fries. Gave 2 stars just to be fair because if the rating is solely on the dish I had, it'll be a pathetic -10. Well, a flat 0 for sure. Ordered the value double tavern burger or whatever it's called. WORST burger I've ever ingested in my life. Put it in a very simple comparison, it's the quality of a McDouble disguised as some gourmet restaurant burger. In fact, I MUCH MUCH MUUUUUCH rather take 2 McDouble for $2.50 than one sloppy soggy nonsense for $6.99.  Okay, allow me to explain why the burger was a flat 0 for me. Let's start with the lesser of the evils. 1st, sauce, personally I don't enjoy it, it's not much different than mayonnaise. If it's served in a modest amount it wouldn't bother me, but the whole burger was soaked in it and that leads to another catastrophe which will be covered last. 2nd lettuce, remember those dollar burger you get from either McDonald's or Burger King? Those shredded lettuce? That's fine and all, but when soaked with the overwhelming amount of weird sauce, it just adds to the mess. 3rd, meat patty. FLAVORLESSSSSSSSS. Again, freaking McDouble's frozen patties are more FLAVORED than this. So lastly, the buns. IDK what it is but it felt like it was the cheapest sesame buns that even Walmart doesn't dare to sell. By the second bite, it had already become a bunch of soggy mess. Just imagine dipping cotton candy in a glass of water. Like that episode of Cutthroat Kitchen where they put the judges on the competing floor and Jet Tila had to serve his sandwich with water soaked buns. I don't know who's recipe of burger that is, DISGUSTING. Flavorless is one thing but man, by the 3rd bite everything was soaked into a giant saucy mess. I get it, it's the cheapest dish of yours, but I much rather take that $7 bucks for a ButteryJack from Jack in the Box. That would've been WAYYYYYYY NICER than this tavern double soggy crap. Alright, done venting about the burger. The rest of the restaurant experience was pretty good. Service was good and the unlimited garlic fries were the star of the dish. My gf's burger was also MEH. Granted, either of us order their gourmet or signature burger and we've had it in the past which weren't bad. But with the same price, I'll GLADLY take it to Slater's right across the street or Fuddruckers which we frequent. The fries were amazing, but it's just like Kirlin, the strongest human but an insignificant shrimp fighting against Freeza/Cell/Boo, couldn't save the day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rancho-cucamonga?start=100,3.36,2.93,3.272,2.3760000000000003,3.1020000000000003

Not only did it take approximately 25 min to get our food after ordering, our appetizers came out with the meal, and not beforehand as expected. Also ordered was a bowl of chicken tortilla soup that never came out, so I canceled that and had it removed from the bill. Refills took forever, only after asking the manager for a refill. We went today for lunch, and the entire restaurant was maybe 30% to capacity so no reason why table service was so terrible (maybe short staffed like usual chain restaurants)  I understand the manager is trying to run a restaurant with the budget he was given by corporate, but he needs to fight more for his restaurant and be better staffed with employees to meet the needs of their customer base.

I remember really loving the Red Robin in Moreno Valley when I was 18 my sister and I would go every Saturday, but now 10 years later idk if it's just this location but I'd rather not chance it and spend my money here. Even with the 2 for one tavern deal, our bill was $35 (onion rings, two lemonades, chicken caprice and red tavern burger with the 2 for one deal). I didn't try any of the burgers, but the chicken caprice sandwich fell apart on a ciabatta bun that absorbed any little drop of moisture immediately apparently. Had okay flavor but was not appetizing. I had gotten this after sending the cod and shrimp duo back, which was watered down cod and since both of us have worked in fast food we both immediately were able to tell that the deep fryer oil is old because the batter on everything tasted bad. The fries tasted baked and then deep fried, just off for some reason. Would much rather spend my money at a good mom and pop for cheaper or similar pricing.

I thought it was odd, but we ordered and received our food in a timely manner. The fried pickle nickels were delish, the cod and shrimp duo tasted like old grease and my daughter enjoyed her veggie burger. Our replacement waiter (younger Asian guy with man bun) was cordial but inattentive. We had no napkins no refills no ""how is everything"" nada. Meanwhile original waiter dude is going out of his way checking on the table next to us though he was supposedly on lunch. When I finally got a hold of our waiter I politely asked for napkins and the check which someone else brought to us. I paid and tipped and as I'm walking out I hear our waiter complaining to another server to which she responds ""yeah you gotta rush them out and be like 'anything else???'""

Their gourmet burgers are over done when you ask for ""medium well"". The service sucks as the servers take forever to attend to the table--especially last week when we dined, it was a fund raising night with the police officers and the Red Robin crew took forever to even respond to the blinking green ""call for service"" light in our table.

16,Mia N.,"Los Angeles, CA",58,78,3.0,1.0,2017-11-01,"First, let call out the single good thing about this place:  The host.   He greeted us immediately, he took our information, and he got me an ice water right away.   If there was a way to separately rate him, he'd get five stars. Unfortunately, the rest of the visit didn't even warrant a single star, but Yelp won't let me go lower than one.   Our waitress took our order, and delivered the waters.   Then a half an hour went by.  We were beginning to debate simply leaving, because the waitress was obviously avoiding our table, and no manager seemed to be on duty.   The waitress suddenly appeared and gave us a half-hearted apology for the wait, claiming ""a to go order just came in for 44 burgers, so we're way behind.""  This means that either a) they knew they had a large to go order when she took our order, and it took them half an hour to inform us of the wait, or b) they took the to go order AFTER ours, and put our order behind it.   Either way, unacceptable.   She then asked us if we just wanted our fries while we waited.  So basically we were offered part of our order as a replacement?  It didn't even make sense.   But whatever, we assumed this meant our order would be out shortly. It took another 15-20 minutes for the order to finally come out, and it had quite obviously been sitting out for a good portion of that.  The burgers were warm, but not hot.  The fries, normally  a Red Robin favorite, tasted like frozen fries popped in the oven for not quite enough time.  The waitress once again began avoiding our table, taking the long way around to visit the table next to us and then walking away in the opposite direction while pointedly ignoring us.    Oh, and during this 45-50 minute wait, our drinks were refilled exactly once (before any food was ever brought out).   Once we got our food, we never got another visit from our waitress.  We paid our bill on the electronic kiosk and left.

Expires 12/29/2017. Offer valid once per day. Discount applied to lowest priced Fire-Grilled Gourmet burger."" No extra small text, no other caveats. This was the entirety of the coupon.  So with this deal in hand, we ordered a chicken sandwhich and a tavern burger. When we got our bill, Red Robin refused to honor the coupon, with the manager explaining that the coupon only applied to ""Big"" Tavern burgers, not ""Small"" ones like the one we had ordered. And therefore our order didn't qualify. Notice that the coupon does not state this extra requirement anywhere. And in fact, once we showed the manager the coupon itself, the manager PULLED OUT AN INTERNAL RED ROBIN EMAIL FROM CORPORATE explaining what the coupons ""real"" definition was. So not only are Red Robin coupons not valid as-written but apparently we're also supposed to know what Red Robin's internal policies are before we come in and try to use said coupons. Avoid this place, and perhaps this entire chain. Red Robin deals are apparently not worth the paper (or emails) they're written on.

I logged intoy rewards program and saw I had a 50 % off coupon that said we get half of any fire gourmet with purchase of any additional burger, entree, sandwich, or entree salad. I attached a photo as well. I showed this information to our server. Our server, John, said that this coupon would apply and that the chicken sandwich we ordered would be half off. Shortly after the manager came to our table and explained how it does not apply because I needed to get a ""big"" burger. Confused by her statement, I went to show her what my coupon said. She said , ""I know what it says I don't need to see it"". She didn't even apologize for the inconvenience that someone on her team conveyed the wrong information. Honestly, her rudeness ensued.  When our server came back he asked if everything was better now. We were blunt with him and explained that the coupon says nothing about a big burger/sandwich anywhere. He read the coupon and agreed that our confusion was valid.  The manager came back to our table and immediately took out a printed email that she got from corporate. And there it was.. ""big or fine burger"". She then added that I would have needed to order two gourmet sandwiches for this to be valid. I said okay I understand and she walked away. Didn't even apologize for the confusion. It was clear that she was very focused on proving me wrong rather than explaining the mix-up that was made.  I am writing this review to show that the coupon is infact different than the corporate email this manager received. I am also writing this review to express my frustration with how rude this manager was. Her server was more apologetic for her behavior.  Lastly, I don't want a discount.
