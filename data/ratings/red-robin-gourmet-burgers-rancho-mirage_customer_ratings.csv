155,GP L.,"Rancho Mirage, CA",0,36,5.0,5.0,2012-01-24,"I have to say that if you are on a low carb diet and want the absolute very best protein burger then this is the place. I've had the protein burger at Carl's Jr., In-n-Out and a variety of non-chain places. The way that Red Robin chefs choose the lettuce leaf to wrap their protein burger is a lesson to be learned by all others. And the burger itself is excellent. All other places just slap two pieces of lettuce around the burger. Red Robin chooses the leafs that form an almost perfect hamburger bun. A bit on the expensive side, yes, worth the money, absolutely. If you aren't on a low carb diet it is still a great burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rancho-mirage?start=140,3.4440000000000004,3.4440000000000004,3.4440000000000004,3.4440000000000004,3.4440000000000004

I'm the kinda guy that eats wasabi in plenty with my sushi. Anyway, about 9 hours after eating that burger my guts started cramping something fierce and the burnin' love burger spent the next hour very unloving lighting my a$$ hole on fire.

The first paragraph says it all. I ordered the BBQ chicken wrap and soup combo (French onion). It was all delicious. Really good job on the soup because they crisped up the Swiss cheese just the way I like it. The wrap was tasty and filling. My daughter ordered the Mac n cheese with a side salad and the Mac was definitely not from a box, cheesy and cooked well. I gave the 4th star for the excellent service of our waiter.

60,Ryan M.,"Orange County, CA",909,913,3417.0,2.0,2013-11-23,"After getting stuck on the 210 to the 10 Freeway Transition headed to Phoenix, I got hungry. All that waiting in traffic made me warm up and gave me an empty stomach. With the help of Yelp, I found a safe bet at Red Robin's in Rancho Mirage.  I had arrived around 7pm Friday evening and Rancho Mirage was bloody windy. I had to run from the movie parking lot to Red Robin's front entrance. This Red Robin's was pretty packed. There was a wait of about 5-10 minutes. I am not sure if the crowd was because of the movie theatre or the trip to/from Phoenix or it was just Friday for Rancho Mirage. This was one busy location that I have ever seen. Probably more packed than any Los Angeles store locations. My name was called up and I was under the care of my server, Nicole. Like my last Red Robin's visit, I had a hankering for my favorite dish. Right away, I had ordered the Whiskey River BBQ Chicken Wrap with, of course, bottomless steak fries ($10.19). Don't forget, I don't drink soda anymore. Water is my drink of choice. The wait for my order is about 10-15 minutes. During my observation, the place was always filled. Once a party left, the busboys cleaned the table and the table was ready for the next party.  Another server brought my food to my table and I was surprised it was not Nicole. I am not sure if that is how the procedures works, but it was surprising to me. However, Nicole did check on me on occasion. I've noticed that my order of the Whiskey River BBQ Chicken was smaller than usual. My hands can wrap around it several times over. The taste is consistent like the other Red Robin's locations, but the value for the size I ordered was not consistent. Also, the amount of fries that I received did not fill the metal cup on my plate. I did ask Nicole for more fries, but the first dish should have plenty of fries upfront. I was not at all satisfied with the meal, but it was close to satisfactory as I could get this Red Robin's to meet my criteria. However, it was close to a fail. My road trip to Phoenix had only one memory that I don't want to remember, but I have to. Well, I think I need to get my Red Robin's Royalty Card soon. Too many visits already...or not not enough?!

He sat me immediately, was nice and was the only one who said ""let me know if you need anything."" Which I thought was a little above and beyond as a host. His name might have been Eric. Not sure. The server arrived after a while and asked if I wanted anything to drink. I told her I definitely wanted a drink but not sure of what yet.. (opportunity to upsell). She responded with, "" should I just get you a water?"" Her loss. I ordered the teriyaki chicken burger, which is one of my fave burgers and with well done fries. My food came out timely, but the fries were soggy and old already. What a bummer since Red Robins fries are something to always look forward to. I had to ask for a fresh batch, which were tasteless. I loaded it with the seasoning salt, of course. On to the burger, the pineapple was not good. It wasn't even yellow. It was white and not good.  I drank my water half way through my meal and it was not filled back up until nearly the end. The server passed and never offered to refill my water, so I placed it at the edge of the table for them to see. She even dropped off the check without getting the hint. It wasn't until I asked a bus boy to help me get water that I got some.  The service was lacking. There was no attention; needless to say any service at all. She was an order taker and that's all.

However after exploring my menu options at red robin I realized that this place was up there with dine-in restaurants at every affordable prices catering to a wide variety of college students and others. I was inclined to try the root beer float because of the hot weather and later to my happy surprise refills were free. Anyways me and my girlfriend both had the angus burgers her with regular fries which again were bottom less and mine with garlic fries which were exceptionally good and bottom less.

I have ordered the tavern double burger w/no bun several times in the last few weeks. This was the first time it was served to me with lettuce and tomato on the burger. Very nice!

We ordered the queso and chips to start, and they brought us about 7 chips, to feed our hungry family of 4. We had to ask for a refill two more times, and still had plenty of queso left...we just got tired of asking and waiting 5-10 minutes in between each delivery. I ordered a burger ""pink"" on a gluten free bun. It was well done, not other way to describe it. Since I prefer medium rare, it was a huge letdown. The gluten free bun was cardboard I think, worst gf bun I've had anywhere. If only they were a huge chain and could find a really good gf option. Oh wait... The mac and cheese for kids used to include free refills, but no longer. And the bottomless fries were just like the chips...you get like 7 per serving and have to rely on your wait staff to bring continuous refills. Clearly they think they are serving a 5 year old child and not a grown adult male. Service was so slow I imagine they were out back harvesting the potatoes. As I write this I'm sure our un-bussed dishes are still sitting on our table. They have gotten way too cheap for us.

Oh my gosh, if I posted a pic, you'd be disgusted. Visually, I saw the containers were full of crud on the outside, oil or who knows what. I used a napkin to wrap around it in order to use it. Yup, napkin stuck to the oil one. The vinegar one was just somewhat sticky. Then, the first of the chicken breasts was over done...just about rubbery. Yes, I ate it. Sauce made it tolerable. Then the 2nd breast came. That one was perfectly done. I go back thinking my last visit was a fluke and it can't always be that bad, but I gotta say, my last few visits have been anything but great.

Whether it was the half hearted welcome from a hostess who barely made eye contact, to the booth at which we were sat that had yet to be wiped off yet we were sat there anyhow. After we cleared items to one side of the table the waitress states, oh that table needs to be wiped off, ya think!? My visit was 29 May, in the evening, waitress was Noel, and she did do a solid effort in salvaging our visit. After receiving a draft beer which tasted awful (805 was simply not up to standard that night) she replaced it with another selection and made sure it was not charged. Originally I had asked about what IPA's were available on draft, I was given a quick verbal listing of all available beers, which was incorrect since I later saw a full listing on the wall in chalk.... if you don't know what you offer, why should I want any of it? The food was minimally acceptable by Red Robin standard, however the ranch dressing was watered down somehow, I was tempted to make a video, dipping a fry into dressing shouldn't resulted in said dressing dripping off the fry like it was milk. Watching another staff member in a black polo shirt converse with a customer/friend about the hockey match on, while noticing the menu's and other items on the table were sticky and dirty and likely had not been cleaned in quite awhile made me feel like leaving... however, the food was warm, but in a ""high-end"" burger joint, when the first good point that comes to mind is ""food was warm"" .... that means you seek another location. The issues with my visit do have one thing related, management, all of these things show it is they that need replacing, dirty items, menu's, poor server knowledge, lack of enthusiasm, are all things that don't exist when management is solid, when it's not, again, you find another location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rancho-mirage?start=40,3.0,3.13,3.13,2.8520000000000003,3.078

It started off as just lettuce and chicken. Overall it was pretty filling. I think you'd have to ask for extra chicken. My friend ordered the croissant BLTA sandwich.

0,Jannel W.,"Santa Ana, CA",61,5,,5.0,2017-09-04,We went on 9/1/2017 right when they opened.  This is by far the best Red Robin I have ever been to. The staff was very attentive. We didn't have to ask for refills on anything. Chris was our server (I think he was also a bartender?) and he did an absolute wonderful job.   The order was 100% accurate. The restaurant was clean. The manager touched our table to make sure everything was going alright.  We left very pleased with this Red Robin. If we are ever in the area again we will definitely be stopping by.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rancho-mirage?start=20,3.2,3.24,3.24,,3.2240000000000006

My husband had to get up to go get her because she was sitting down hanging out with some co workers. I'm so annoyed, I honestly just want to get up and leave. I shouldn't have to tell someone how to do their job. Absolutely disappointed in her service. I had to update this review it's now been ONE HOUR and I still do not have my appetizer. Ridiculous. Anyways, some tall bald guy (im guessing the manager) came over after waiting for our drinks for 45 minutes and mentioned ""I'm sorry the drinks are taking a while.. don't blame your server. it is my fault"" Okay?? so whoever's fault it is/was i shouldn't have to wait this long.Maybe your understaffed? Maybe its lack of teamwork? Whatever it is, i'm a customer and that's not my fault. i was expecting him to comp or even give us a discount. Nope nothing at all.

26,Yadi E.,"San Marcos, CA",364,187,342.0,4.0,2017-09-18,"I've been here twice and had a 5 star experience the first time. And a 2 star experience the second time. So I decided to give this a chain the benefit of a doubt with a 4 star average.  First time I went, the service was awesome, fast, friendly. And the food was quick and tasty. BOTTOMLESS FRIES! Had a pina colada what that was dangerously delicious. Left super happy and efficiently. Second time we decided to dine here, we were sat immediately in the back of the restaurant, then moved to a different table because the waitress said she might forget about us if we weren't in the front seating area... okay no big deal, we gave our drink orders and mentioned we were kinda in a rush because we had a movie to catch. Waitress came back and we gave our food order. I wanted to substitute my burger patty with the vegan party and all was well. Waitress didn't come back until 15 minutes later and said they were out of the vegan patties but tried to sub me the veggie patty. Didn't care for that and just wanted fries. She insisted I try the veggie patty and that she would comp our whole meal. Very generous but it was a very uncomfortable situation. Manager stopped by to give her condolences and the food came 6 minutes after that. At that point, we asked them to wrap it up to go. Sat in my car and unwrapped my burger, to take a bite full of pickles!! I was so upset lol hate pickles and just had that one serving of fries.

36,Lara H.,"Palm Springs, CA",17,7,5.0,3.0,2017-10-08,I was recommended to try Red Robin and I'm somewhat glad that I did. One of their many burgers that I love getting is the red tavern double. I've only had it once but even writing about it now I feel like I should be heading there for one. They add extra cheese which melts and covers the meat with absolute perfection. It was delicious. The only thing I would say is that service is slow especially during peak hours and there was one particular waitress that seems like she preferred being elsewhere. It was a great meal only marred by a grumpy waitress.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rancho-mirage,3.08,3.18,3.18,,3.1400000000000006

They get hard very fast, and even if they bring you out more, it's the same thing. It didn't seem this way in the past, but maybe they changed the cooking oil.

4,Kathie W.,"Las Vegas, NV",8,3,,1.0,2017-10-30,"This was our first visit to the Rancho Mirage Red Robin.  We have had much better experiences at other RRs.  Service here was rather slow; the couple next to us arrived much later than we did, and were served at the same time as us. I was not happy with my lunch, which was a ""perfectly cooked"" (per the menu) seared salmon.  At first, it was quite dry.  I mentioned this to the server, who said she'd let the kitchen know.  (No apology.)  Later in the meal, I came upon a really unsavory part of the fish, and mentioned this to the server as well.  She reiterated that she'd tell the cooks about it.  I wasn't really telling her these problems this in order to improve the meals of future customers, but rather to let her know that I was very unhappy with my meal.  Again, no apology whatsoever.  I found this off-putting, as was the salmon. We both used the restroom on our way out.  My husband mentioned that the toilet in the men's room was covered with urine.  Ugh.  In the women's room, there were signs for the servers telling them how to wash their hands:  specifically, the length of scrub time AND the (very warm) water temperature needed.  I ran the water in the sink for some time, and it never got beyond cold.  So this is where the servers wash their hands? Last but not least, this is a tiny thing, but when we asked for toothpicks on our way out, we were told that they didn't have them.  Surprising for a restaurant, and a very cheap perk to offer. We'll probably try another Red Robin again, but definitely not this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rancho-mirage?start=20,3.24,3.22,3.22,,3.2280000000000006

It's a fun place with cool decor. Balloons for the kids were a big hit, but I'm not sure the other guests thought so.  The fries are endless as well as the kids sides.

We asked various wait staff for refills on drinks and additional bottomless items and waited forever for them to come.  Yes, it was dinner time on a Saturday night. I get that.

20,Glen K.,"Thousand Palms, CA",110,218,2.0,4.0,2018-01-06,"Happy Birthday to ME! As a member of the Red Royalty, I get a free Gourmet Burger at Red's.  My wife and I arrived just after six on a Saturday night - movie night - and the place was packed. We were told there was up to a 40-minute wait but we could eat at the bar. Rather than wait and get hungrier and hungrier, we opted for that.  I decided on the A.1 Peppercorn Burger, normally $11.89. She got the small Red's Tavern Double, which is a very good deal at $6.99.  We enjoyed our burgers - yummm! The service was fine except they brought her fries instead of the requested salad. Maybe the server couldn't hear over the din because, as I mentioned, the place was full of people and it was very noisy. But still it was a nice time. Here's a little hint: whenever you get a free or discounted meal like this, figure your tip on the total price as it would be if it wasn't discounted. Otherwise if I had gone in by myself and had only water, the tip would have been zero. The server has to work just as hard even if the business takes a hit.
