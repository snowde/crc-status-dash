If you go there anytime on their slow time They have no waiters they just seat you near the bar where the bartender takes your order. There's nothing wrong with the bartender being a waiter but when they don't want to be a waiter because they're a bartender the service is the worst ever. I think next time I go I'd ask to sit not near the bar so I could possibly get a real waiter that will be fast an know what to ask.

On a recent visit to Reading, I stopped by to ask them about it and was told that they were switching to Red Royalty within a few weeks. So hopefully by now, that is no longer a problem. This Red Robin is in a strip mall on Route 422 westbound. If you're heading eastbound, a left on the first traffic light past Red Robin will get you there. The touchscreen device on the table is a bad trend that I hope will end soon. It has its uses; you can use it to order extra items and pay your bill. However, I noticed that the screen kept going back to the games section offering unlimited play for a fee. So I kept that device turned away the whole time. It's an annoyance.

We went because it was my birthday to receive the free burger as per the loyalty system. When we received our burgers and fries they were lukewarm at best and that's when this place started losing points in my book. I drink tap water all the time without problems and could not stomach the water at this location, having to buy a drink instead.

Chargrilled favor,just  the right amount of cheese. Unlimited fries & onion rings, that description is funny. Usually that would mean a large overflowing amount of rings and/or fries that usually get thrown out. Wifey had maybe 6-8 steak fries and I had 4-5 onion rings.  neither of which were completely  gobbled up. Good menu enticement ""Unlimited"" I don't think anyone could/would ask for more.

16,Tara Marie S.,"Philadelphia, PA",61,57,23.0,1.0,2015-06-29,"We have come to Red Robin somewhat routinely, so overall we have liked the restaurant and seek it out because it's a good place for kids and they have a good menu.  This time we were coming back from a camping trip, and we stopped for a long awaited meal (after eating camp food for 5 days). I noticed that their menu had changed since we last came, so we thought this might indicate improvements.... Not. so. I saw they had gotten rid of the different sizes for salads, which I was fine with. I ordered the Whiskey Rio BBQ Salad without meat (since I am a vegetarian). Not ONE of their salads comes without meat (except the house salad) so I am always forced to make modifications. The waitress said she would add extra baja veggies and avocado in place of the meat. My sons ordered mac and cheese and grilled cheese off the kids menu. 1. When the salad came, I couldn't believe how much they had reduced the quantity and quality. I used to have trouble finishing their salads, but this was served on a plate, with one thin layer of lettuce, fluffed up to look like more. It had a meager sprinkling of tiny cubed tomato and some corn, with 2 tiny circles of bread and 3 thin slices of avocado. If there was ""extra"" anything, I can't imagine how the salad would look without extra! There was nothing of substance to that $10 salad, and I was still hungry after eating it. There was just nothing but lettuce, tomato, corn, and a little bit of avocado, and it was about the size of a house salad.  2. They reduced the size of the grilled cheese sandwich for kids and cut it up into little pieces to ""confuse"" you and make it look like more. The fries were limp and undercooked. My son was also still hungry. 3. My other son's mac and cheese was cheap, flavorless ""from a box"" macaroni. Very inexpensive to make and not quality. He ordered a fruit cup, and it was absolutely disgusting; mushy, disintegrating fruit floating in a mash/juice mix. He LOVES fruit, and he hated it. He actually told the waitress it was disgusting, but she didn't offer to get him anything else or say anything about it... 4. The waitress was generally unresponsive and awkward. She wasn't rude, she just didn't seem to respond to anything. It took a long time to get her attention after I got my salad, she didn't really have anything to ""say"" about the issues we were having. When my friend ordered a salad without meat and asked what else he could substitute, she said ""Why? Are you a vegetarian?"" That's just an odd thing to say, and it felt like being questioned or judged about his tastes. Normally when someone orders something at restaurant, the waitress doesn't say ""Why?"" or ask questions. It's implied that we don't like something if we aren't ordering it... She didn't offer my son a replacement on his fruit cup, and she didn't apologize for the tiny salad or the limp fries. Just a very odd social demeanor.  I probably won't be back. It seems to me that they are changing the menu to reduce portions and quality deliberately, and I am tired of feeling like I get ripped off when I go to restaurants. Salads are already overpriced at most restaurants to begin with, and this was off the charts.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reading,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52

My family and I went out to dinner here a couple weeks ago and were pleased. 5 of us at 7 PM, and we got a table in about 20 minutes. (Not having a cell phone, I get annoyed by the paging system some restaurants have adopted where they will text you when your table is available, but they called my name when I told them I don't have a cell.) My father in law ordered one of the gourmet burgers (something with smoke and pepper, I think) and raved about it during and after the meal. The allergy menu is very informative and user friendly (it's on an Ipad) and our particular waitress was very well-informed and helpful in using it. The draft beer menu wasn't anything particularly impressive, but they had a decent selection of craft brew in the bottle (my father in law and I both ordered Stoudt's DIPA, which was quite good but probably had been in the cooler for a while since the hop aroma was lacking). Red Robin has adopted an on the table tablet side-menu and game system, which is sort of cool in that you can pay with plastic at the table and order drinks through wifi (as well as play competitive games with others at Red Robin for $1.99) but also a tad annoying in that it's a bright shiny thing glaring up at the table, drawing your eye during conversation.

13,Mike L.,"Reading, PA",59,13,4.0,2.0,2017-01-20,"This review is based SOLELY on our last experience at Red Robin. Usually, this is one of our favorite places to go when we want simply beer and burgers. Are they the greatest burgers on the face of God's green earth? No, but they are damn tasty. My wife and I ordered the onion ring tower and drinks, which all came out promptly. We ordered our burgers and then proceeded to wait, and wait, and wait, and wait, and did I mention that we were waiting? Our waitress, seemed to avoid us which led me to believe that she messed something up, which is fine. I don't expect perfection, if  you made a mistake just say so instead of us sitting there watching our server walk past us a bunch of times to serve food to people who came long after us. We watched 3 people arrive, eat and pay all during the time that we waited for our burgers. Finally the manager, came over and apologized and said that the kitchen lost our ticket. I worked in restaurants and interpreted that as follows...""your server never entered it but it's a lot easier to blame the faceless kitchen rather than the person I will be sending back over to your table in 5 minutes."" Either way, I didn't mind that a mistake was made, just that the server clearly avoided us rather than simply stopping by and acknowledging that we were waiting a long time. If she would have come over and said ""I am sorry, something happened and the kitchen didn't get your check or (enter whatever excuse you want here) and then  offered an appetizer or the french fries, that are bottomless anyway, while we waited, it would have been perfectly fine. The manager did a great job, she acknowledged, apologized and comped our food. She said that she could not comp our alcohol, understandable, but ended up giving us gift cards that totaled the amount of our drinks anyway. We will be back as I said this place is usually really good, but this particular time was less than optimal. On the bright side, I am really happy that Red Robin is utilizing the NoWait app, we could ""get in line"" at home and then by the time we arrived at the restaurant our table is ready. As packed as this place can get at times, that is handy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reading,2.32,2.32,2.32,,2.32
9,Julio E.,"Reading, PA",25,4,2.0,5.0,2017-03-10,Our server Jesse was the man. Unfortunately the machine at our table rebooted and we couldn't fill out the survey (so sorry Jesse) but my wife and I wanted to give him a 10 for outstanding service.

4,Brian Z.,"Reading, PA",0,92,,2.0,2017-03-25,"I still like this place even after my latest visit. Monday night, about 7:30.  No wait, seated immediately. Waitress came fast enough but she seemed like she could care less. My order came out correct but my friend asked for no bun.  Since chain restaurants use the absolutely asinine practice of server sharing, our waitress wasn't the person who delivered the food. The woman who delivered the food was out of there like the roadrunner. Maybe the original waitress didn't write down no bun but the BS that comes with server sharing prevents any rectifying the mistake.  Maybe the hamburger robot in the kitchen was malfunctioning. Whenever a place uses server sharing they get the absolute bottom end of pre-tax tip.  No one does a decent job then no one gets a good tip. Otherwise, the food has always been good here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reading,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
8,Andy M.,"Carmel, IN",0,23,,2.0,2017-04-02,"I'm always sad when I don't heed the star rating on Yelp!  Poor dining experience here!   Here are some highlights: 1.  10 minutes for the waitress to acknowledge our existence after seating. 2. No napkins or silverware on the table 3.  Waiter drops the appetizer on the table in a fly by and says "" running low on plates"" and doesn't even slow down.  Here we sit with greasy onion rings, no plates, silverware or napkins.  I assume they expected us to eat off the table like Neanderthals. 4.  Waitress wanders by again, sees no plates.  Advise her of her coworkers warning that the restaurant is ""low on plates"".  She rolls her eyes and gets some plates. 5.  Apparently Red Robin cooks burgers two ways - Pink and No Pink.  Here they cook them Pink.  Period.  Even if it turns your spouses stomach.  They ask what you want.  They bring you Pink.    Usually I try to end wIth something positive.  Got nothing this time. Cannot recommend this particular Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reading,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
12,Toby E.,"Reading, PA",0,10,,5.0,2017-04-29,Service at this Red Robin was great! Been going here from time to time over the past few years now. Thy decided to take a drink off the menu that I always drank when I was there. Asked the server about it and she confirmed that yes it had been taken off the menu. She informed me that even though it was no longer on the menu she would still have the staff make it for me! She could of easily just said no we no longer have it but she went above and beyond to make us happy. I will definitely be going to this Red Robin more often now!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reading,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48

7,Aja T.,"Douglassville, PA",62,2,,1.0,2017-06-12,Terrible service we waited almost twenty minutes for a server to come to our table and get our drinks the French fries and onion ring were fried to death I won't ever return to this location,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reading,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
2,Christopher B.,"Dennis, NJ",1,11,29.0,3.0,2017-07-24,So lets start this review off by saying when we ordered drinks they had no ginger rale so i got a root beer. I didn't order an appetizer so i ordered my meal a Cheese Berger which took forever then finally our waitress came but no food....  Well guess what our food was dropped our waitress said that another waitress dropped it but they redeemed their self for that one by subtracting the burger from the bill then for dessert i ordered a Cheesecake which also took long but don't worry that wasn't dropped but anyway the Cheesecake was also great so overall this red robin was ok.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reading,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
5,Albert S.,"Reading, PA",0,1,,5.0,2017-09-08,"I am a CEO - I deal with all sorts of people everyday. I naturally review review and review.  First: I was seated instantaneously. Second: It was beyond spotless. Third: My waitress was amazing and kind - she also the booth right next me thanked a Marine for his service...it meant a lot to me because I am a Veteran too. Fourth: The food was great too. Now my sons were nuts, but what can you expect from a 9 year old and a 4 year old. Ultimately it was a great success. Kids are happy, I was happy, I had a Daddy's night out with my sons - and most importantly a Veteran felt honor...I spoke to him myself. I wished I got my waitress's name so I could include her in this review, but it's probably best to keep a hero's work silent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reading,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68
0,Ken A.,"Douglassville, PA",0,14,3.0,3.0,2017-09-30,Our visit started with call ahead we were told 15 to 30 min wait and it took 10 to get there unfortunately it was a 45min wait . The manager was aware of this and comped us 2 starters that were both very good. Our burgers were all ok but all the fresh fruit/ vegetables were very old and they should of been ashamed to serve them the carrots and salad were old And dried out and the fruit salad had strawberries that were starting to rot,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reading,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
1,Sam K.,"Reading, PA",0,2,,1.0,2018-01-14,"Normally I don't have an issue with Red Robin, but this is absolutely ridiculous. We've tried calling both the carside to go extension and the regular customer service extension multiple times over the last hour to no avail, waiting as long as five minutes for someone to pick up. This restaurant also did not show up on the online ordering option like it normally does, so I'm not sure if their system is down, or if they forgot to tell people that it's not a thing anymore. Regardless, it's poor customer service and totally unacceptable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-reading,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
