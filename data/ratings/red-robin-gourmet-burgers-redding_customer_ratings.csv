120,Trevor B.,"Redding, CA",44,31,21.0,3.0,2012-02-17,"I actually had my first red robin experience not too long ago!  I was excited because I had grown up seeing red robin commercials!  Honestly I wasn't extremely impressed. A friend that went with me loved it and said it was the best burger she's ever had.  They give TONS of fries.  They are bottomless so they keep bringing them out! The fries were okay to me. For some reason they wouldn't hold salt on them. I put loads of salt and it just slides off.  Other than that, if you are into that style of food go for it! For me, I'm not a fan of too much greasy fatty foods.  Great service! Very friendly, awesome atmosphere!  Many of my friends love it here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redding?start=100,3.36,3.36,3.36,2.9240000000000004,3.3600000000000003

Some servers are super nice and are on top of refills and fries but lately we have been getting terrible service. It was a monday we went for lunch and waited 15 minsutes before someone seated us, and we had a lady serving us and she was a little older than the rest. She never gave us a refill on my husbands coke and we had to basically beg her for more fries and napkins. I wish that all the servers are friendly all the time. My advice is, is if your tired of being a server, then find a different job because it effects the customers and the business!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redding?start=120,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.8600000000000003,3.2800000000000002

And to top it off they're actually good! Which is almost becoming too much to ask for these days. I'm always looking for kid friendly places and Red Robin is one of the best. Great kids menu options, loud and friendly atmosphere, and free balloons.  Prices are actually good too! Walked out this time with two kids meals, two burgers, and two soft drinks for $37.

I have always been a fan of Red Robin, from their clucks and fries (with barbeque mayo, of course) to their Royal Red Robin burger.  It's not five-star, high-quality material, but it's tasty, and there's lots to choose from, even if you're not a big burger fan. This place is friggin' PACKED on most weekends, so have a back-up restaurant ready.  The staff has overall been very friendly and quick.  It's a fun, boisterous, bordering on insane atmosphere.  It will seriously give someone with PTSD a flashback, though.  Trust me. Also, if you're planning on a slice of Mile-High Mud Pie after your sandwich, be sure to share.  One slice can easily satisfy three women, it's that big and chocolatey...That doesn't sound right, does it?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redding?start=80,3.36,3.36,3.36,3.088,3.3600000000000003
95,Brian H.,"Fontana, CA",7,35,1.0,3.0,2012-07-08,"Stopped in late one night while on a driving trip to Portland.  There was no hostess there to greet us initially, so we sat in the bar. The food was ok at best - not bad, but nothing to write home about.  We did notice that the Mac and Cheese seemed to be simply pasta noodles covered with melted cheddar (no cheese sauce or anything like that).  For myself, I ordered one of the smaller plate burgers, which turned out to be ideal, given the time of night. What saves this review was the service.  Maybe because it was late, maybe because it was busy - but the waiter was very attentive and helpful when we asked about where in town offered a good breakfast.  This was much appreciated.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redding?start=80,3.32,3.32,3.32,2.9240000000000004,3.3200000000000003

76,Elaine B.,"Redding, CA",0,46,1.0,2.0,2013-02-05,"With just two stars, you may think I'm being harsh, but the last two times I was dragged here (yes, dragged by my kid) it has been a horrible experience at the hostess stand). I don't understand why they cannot figure out if they cannot seat a table of twelve right away, they can still seat tables of two, three, five, etc. and so on.   Last time I was there, there were several parties that were very large, I'm talking like 18-20. They made all of the smaller parties wait until they had room to seat the larger tables. Now, I'm no rocket restaurant-scientist, but there was room to seat the smaller groups right away. I hope they get this worked out because it's so frustrating. Pros:  My kid loves this place, new reward card is a great idea Cons: I don't like this place, not a fan of burgers, etc.  Way too loud, way too many BD parties, inept front of house hostesses that can't seat in-coming parties accordingly. Way too long of a wait to be seated when there's obviously open tables for smaller parties.

123,Sarah R.,"Redding, CA",92,12,,2.0,2013-03-16,"My boyfriend brought me here a couple of weeks ago and I was disgusted with the food. I have been here quite a few times hoping that it will get better but I have yet to be fully satisfied when leaving red robin. Its either the food or the service that are bad each time. Prior to this last visit the food was good and the service was bad. Bottomless frys have no meaning when your server never brings them to you. Especially after asking her 3 times to please bring them.  On the other hand, this last time I had good service.  My boyfriend and I each ordered the same chicken sandwhich. Mine was horrible. My boyfriend loved his but as I bit into mine I wanted to gag. Flavorless, cold freezer chicken is what they gave me between two buns. I thought it was just me being picky so I had my boyfriend try my sandwich.  He couldn't eat it either even though he just ate the same sandwich.  Why mine was so bad I couldn't tell you.  My server didn't really pay any attention to me not eating my sandwich and pushing it to the side. It took a random server who was nice enough to actually pay attention to our table to get any help. He brought the manager who offered to replace it but I was so grossed out I just had it taken off the bill. I didn't want anymore of their cold, nasty food.

Peppercorn burger, it's a mouth party of flavor.  If your over 21, it's more comfortable to sit in the bar area, it's usually no more loud if not quieter than the rest of the restaurant.  Their only downfall at this place is that it seems like you have to pull teeth to get extra fries.  I usually order fries in advance because heaven knows they are impossible to make so they take forever here, yet half the time they don't make it in time, the last visit the fries finally came after we were paying the tab and that's with ordering them when you were asked for drinks!  Aside from that, the service is good and the waiting staff are generally friendly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redding?start=100,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.8640000000000003,3.2800000000000002

100,Gregory P.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,14,,2.0,2013-08-19,Wanted a good burger tonight so we decided on Red Robin.  While driving over there I was thinking that there was something about the last trip there that turned me off so much that I had not been back in over a year but I couldn't remember exactly what it was.  So we went.  We got a table right away.  So far so good but that is where the good ended.  The service was very slow.  It took about 10 minutes before the server came over to get our drink order.  Then another 15 before she came back for our meal order.  We both ordered burgers.  The server did not ask how we wanted them prepared.  They came WELL-DONE.  Wish I had thought to say medium-rare.  The bottomless fries are a good selling feature.  It shouldn't be a problem that my plate came with half a dozen steak fries on it.  And it wouldn't have been if I could have gotten the advertised refill.  They never came!!!  The only thing that came in a timely manner was the check.  I was happy to get the experience behind me and move on so I paid and left.  Hopefully a year from now I will remember why we don't go there and steer clear.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redding?start=120,3.48,3.48,3.48,2.6640000000000006,3.4800000000000004

So if you're trying to watch you're figure it's not the best place to go. You can get a simply grilled chicken burger or a salad minus the bad toppings if you want to heat healthy here.

116,Keith V.,"Redding, CA",0,1,,2.0,2014-02-21,"I'm normally a huge fan of Red Robin.  Every time (with the exception of the last time I was there which I chose not to review because I was giving them the benefit of a doubt but not this time) that I go to Red Robin the food is amazing and the service is outstanding, outgoing & so friendly.  Until today that is.  We went the day before my brothers birthday since I work the next day & wont be able to celebrate with him.  We waited and waited for a server to get things started and finally he comes over (plus size guy wearing jean shorts?? not what I wanna see when dining out) and takes our drink order.  Another long wait and he finally gets our food order.  We specifically asked for a side of mayo, ranch, honey mustard & for a basket of fries to start out with while we waited for the meal.  While waiting he gave refills to 3 members of our party but ignored myself and my brother.  My mom finally got annoyed and asked our server if we could have the fries we ordered and he took off we assumed to go get them.  We never even got them.  After a while a different server brought us our food but not the condiments we asked for (not his fault as he didn't take the order & he gave us better service in those few minutes than we got all night).  This second server was told it was my brothers birthday and even said my brother would be one of the next ones to be sung to, but you have to complete most of your meal before they come out I've noticed so we figured it'd be a while.  Well, my brother and I never got asked if we wanted refills.  My nephew asked for his honey mustard again but as before, it never arrived.  Then our server drops off the check.  Really?  Not going to ask if we want dessert?  Still no offer to refill our drinks?  I was actually wanting to get the red velvet cake for dessert but by this point I was pissed and so was my brother.  My mom suggested we were not giving a tip and I totally agreed.  The worst service I've ever gotten at a restaurant.  I was a server at one time and never would I dream of disappearing and not offering to refill drinks or get more fries or offer dessert or not work that tip as much as I could with excellent service.  This guy was atrocious.  We complained to the gal that finally collected our check after ten minutes of waiting and my brother finally just leaving before he started a scene.  She brought a manager over and she was very wonderful and handled everything as she should have.  I will be back because of that but if I get this gentleman as my server... I will either leave or ask for a new section.  It was supposed to be a fun and festive night but it got ruined by disgusting service.  I've seen some of the best servers in my life work there so I'm shocked.  Even the previous visit there with the female server that ignored us (we tipped her) was way better than him.  He seemed to get this whatever I'm done with you attitude half way through our visit.  We couldn't even complain about the cold fries because he was never around.  What a joke.  I love Red Robin and I totally recommend it to anyone, just... don't allow this to happen to you.  Speak up.  The managers are very visible and watching, but they cant know everything that's happening unless you say something.  That was our bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redding?start=120,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.7280000000000006,3.2800000000000002

It is loud in this restaurant, be prepared to have to lean way in to have a conversation, it felt like one big birthday party.  Everyone in the building must have had a birthday and when they sing since it is so loud in the building the singers all shout to be heard, too much. I remember Red Robin making decent food, but the Ensenada Chicken dish they serve could have been from yesterday held in the window. The chicken breast was flat and very dry, it looked much better in the photo album they call a menu. The salad was boring, all iceberg, big chunks of core and the dressing very flavorless.

Our meal took a little bit to come out but no too bad, maybe they were unusually busy for a Wednesday night. Then the food came and the kids loved their burgers, and fish. My sons kids salad was bigger than mine which I thought odd.  My Guacamole bacon burger was missing seasoning and the kids freckled fruit salad was awful, neither kid could eat it. The strawberries were mush and almost gone and is was floating in liquid. My 7 year old actually said, ""this looks nothing like the picture or I wouldn't have gotten it.""

After inhaling uber burger, while eating my second basket of bottomless steak fries, and reflecting on what it will be like to deal with my first heart attack the waitress came over and told me some startling news. She apparently had neglected to realize and take note of the fact that the uber burger was so Uber that it was a specialty burger and not just a burger for the masses. So the birthday discount would not apply to the master race of hamburgers.  She was nice enough to call the manager whose name was Michelle who also seems like a very nice person since she took the price of the burger off the bill, as it was noticeably their mistake that they were willing to rectify and correction quickly. and I said rectify not erectify, its not that kind of restaurant.

I also do NOT like that I have to pay my bill myself. Again, waitressing is a service industry. I'm paying/tipping for a service. Unfortunately the service at this red robin has gone downhill.

So I wanted to take my mom and 4 kids out to a fun, family friendly restaurant for dinner tonight. By the way it was far from it. We arrived and we were told it was a 15 min wait! Great!!!! They seat the 6 of us in a tiny half bench/half table that possibly normally would seat 4 people. We voiced are complaint that we wouldn't be able to fit here with our food as we were already practically sitting on top of each other so they worked something out and sat us elsewhere ( thank you) after ordering our food right away we waited  an additional 45 mins for it to arrive. One of the kids meals were mistakenly forgot about (oops we all make mistakes) all of our fries were very cold and brown looking a little shriveled like they sat for way too long! My moms fish was so cold and soggy the breeding was falling off I asked for my chicken burger to be cut in half it wasn't (no big deal, I'm an adult I'll wait for a knife and cut it myself) waiting on the server for 10 mins to ask if our food was good, I then complained he half assed listened mumbled I'll get a manager and walked away still no knife. Manager comes over with our kids meal and apologizes (thank you) I express my compliant he rolls his eyes asks what he can do and walks away. Gets my a knife, now it has sat for 20 mins definitely ice cold by now I asked for a fresh basket of fries as they were delivered old and cold he says no problem. He delivered the fries and walked away, I paid my bill on the kiosk and he walks back over about 10 mins later and says I was going to discount the bill but you have already paid....my response yes I did and I'm not looking for a discount I don't need one I came to dinner to eat and I paid for what I've ordered. He pulled up a chair and asked why I was so unhappy, I explained himself he then asked why I would want to eat there if I was unhappy. I explained I like to eat here, my family likes to eat here and we come here frequently as he can tell by my royalty card. Why am I explaining why I come eat here???? He then proceeds to tell me that I am very rude and he just recently won manager of the year? Ok, congratulations! Tonight the service and food was terrible and yes I complained about it. He then sat right across from me and told me he knew my problem? Ok, thank you! No he voiced that my problem was I am racist against Hispanics and that is what is wrong with me??? Wow! Totally stunned he just called me racist? Where did this come from? Why would he assume such thing when I simply complained about terrible food that was cold!? I'm contacting corporate and I hope that no one else gets treated the way I was tonight in front of my 4 children. My kids have no clue what he meant or what the word racism means! I'm literally in shock. Needless to say I won't be returning!

24,Vicki C.,"Redding, CA",0,5,,1.0,2017-09-20,"What happened to Red Robin? I ordered online, order was supposed to be ready at 6:01, got there at 6:06 to make sure it was ready because I had a special place to be ( reason for ordering online) go up to the bar-nope can't get it there anymore you have to go through the person in the front.. So I waited IN LINE there, as everyone got seated then find out my order wasn't even ready yet. Finally got my food and was able to leave a full half hour after it was supposed to be ready.. Wow thanks missed the special engagement, can't get that back.  The manager was nice enough to take off 25%(still not confirmed) but still, money isn't the issue.  the whole purpose for calling in an order or ordering online is so you don't wait in the lines.  Well not at Red Robin tonight.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redding?start=20,3.52,3.33,3.33,,3.406
19,Jessica S.,"Redding, CA",0,2,,1.0,2017-10-22,"Food wasn't that good. Long wait time. Advised by hostess to address an issue with the manager which she felt was wrong too. When we addressed it with him he was unprofessional and had an oh well kind of attitude. They forgot to put our loyalty card in even after we provided it. Highly disappointed... since we've always had a wonderful experience at the Woodland Red Robin friendly employees, superior service and great food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redding,3.4,3.3,3.3,,3.3400000000000003

5,Debi W.,"Redding, CA",0,1,,1.0,2017-11-08,"Ordered online. My hamburger was well done, no mayo or ketchup. Forgot the fries totally. Ordered seafood platter, it had no tarter or cocktail sauce.

2,Anna S.,"Roseville, CA",54,210,101.0,3.0,2017-11-08,It was decent. Super busy on a Saturday night but amazingly was able to seat our huge party at 5:30pm. The food was your typical fast casual sit down restaurant. Nothing special. Honestly a little over priced for the generic and lack luster burgers. The service was great though. Very attentive and quick to get us drinks and refills.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redding,3.24,3.24,3.24,,3.2400000000000007
8,David K.,"Redding, CA",140,4,,5.0,2017-11-11,"I had to leave a review because of my entire experience last night at Red Robin. First of all, all the staff were very friendly and welcoming and talked to me as my fiancé and I were waiting for a table. Our server, Andi, was one of the nicest people I've ever met and she engaged in actual conversation with us instead of just wanting to know our order. She found out that I was in the military before and we talked a little about that. She left to go put our order in and the manager, Jesús, came out and shook my hand and thanked me for my service and talked a little with me too. It was very nice of them to do that because they didn't have to. The burgers and fries were good as usual there, but their customer service made me want to write this so here I am. Thanks Andi and Jesús for giving my fiancé and I a wonder date night!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redding,3.4,3.26,3.26,,3.3160000000000003

4,Danielle P.,"Monterey, CA",195,2,,1.0,2017-12-10,Use to have such great service but it's completely gone down hill! We placed an order ToGo over the phone and they didn't even put the order though! They are using a 3rd party system now & THEY SUCK! The manager FINALLY came by after talking on the phone to see where our order was & came to put a ticket into the kitchen. This was 30 minuets after I had been waiting in the lobby for my original pickup time! They gave us 25% off our ticket but If I were a manager I would have been more generous since it's clearly their fault. Service needs a revamp!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redding,3.4,3.27,3.27,,3.322
6,Paige F.,"Anderson, CA",35,1,,2.0,2017-12-26,Could've been way better. We started off with a really nice guy as our waiter but he left quickly and was replaced with two girls who really could've been more professional.

Menu in the first 5 seconds, drink order in the next 10 seconds... never took attention off of customers even though he was SWAMPED! He checked on my order multiple times keeping me updated.
