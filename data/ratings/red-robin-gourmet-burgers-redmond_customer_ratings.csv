Red Robin has always had a very limited menu for me, since I'm not a fan of low quality beef.  So normally when we go here I would get a cup of French Onion soup and a 1/2 order of the Quesadillas.  Last Friday night we stopped in at 5:55pm just skirting under the happy hour time. But no wait staff was around to help. I got up to ask the hostess, which were obviously poorly trained in customer service. Too young to understand that the customer pays your wages!!!  When I asked them nicely just to help me get a server before the 6pm time I literally got a no. Really? NO? Nothing we can go for you if it's past 6pm. It's not, hello?  Management desperately needs to send these kids back to school.  Anyway... When I got back to the table luckily a server had arrived and took our happy hour order just in the nick of time.  Then I finally had a chance to look at the new menu.  EVERYTHING that I normally eat was GONE. What bean counter decided to take off the most popular item on the appetizer menu?  Our happy hour mushrooms arrived, YUCK, swimming in oil and undercooked at the same time.  And who serves fried mushrooms with chili sauce? ewwww.  Our happy hour drinks arrived, probably the smallest $7 margarita on the planet. Not really a deal??? We ended up ordering entrees that we've had before.  They were fine, but ended up upsetting both of our stomachs later. In the end, we were treated poorly, small portions and HIGH prices.

The server will mark your ticket ""Allergy Alert"" and that means extra cleaning of the grill, changes of gloves, and several steps of extra quality-control checking, usually including a manager ""drop-by"" to make sure that all is well. They make a little fuss to make sure that things are good for you without making you feel like a jerk, and they exercise good discretion in how much they communicate with you about it. Chances of being accidentally ""glutened"" once you make them aware: very low.

98,Joni H.,"Anchorage, AK",10,23,13.0,1.0,2012-11-09,"Short version: average food, far less than average service.  If you want red robin, go to a different location. Long version:  We all know what to expect coming I to a red robin as far as the quality of the food is concerned. It's mediocre, affordable burgers, fries and other American classics. If you want the best burger of your life, you should know by now a big chain isn't gonna do it, and if they did, you need to stop eating out so darn much and ask grandma to make you a burger.  The food was exactly as expected. Nothing amazing, nothing terrible (however, my fish and chips were dripping grease, but that's what I get for ordering fish and chips at a burger place). What irritated me most was the service.  The waitress was friendly enough, smiling and whatnot, but i don't think she knew what she was doing. Even though she was training another girl, I'm not sure she'd ver been trained.  Here are some gripes I had with my experience here yesterday written as tips for the waitstaff: 1 Bring out plates with the appetizers. 2 Do not stack plates of food on top of each other when bringing entrees to customers. 3 When you bring out entrees, and there is nothing left of the appetizer, clear those plates, especially if the customer has to stack things to make entrees fit. 4 Your employer advertises bottomless fries. Don't let a customer sit there for 10+ minutes without any before your manager happens to walk by and ask if they want more.  I would have been satisfied with the service if only one or 2 of those things happened, but when it all happens and there's 3 occupied tables in your section (I went at 2-ish pm. Not peak eating time) something's gotta give. I do not recommend this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redmond?start=80,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.468,3.2000000000000006
99,Charles M.,"Renton, WA",0,70,162.0,2.0,2012-12-17,"Came in late Thursday night with my wife.  My wife was craving fish and we thought we'd be too late to get to Ivar's and I recalled that the fish sandwiches at Red Robin were pretty tasty, so we stopped in. I ordered the fish sandwich and my wife got the fish and chips.  It took some time for our waiter to get around to us, he apologized and attributed the delay to a group of 10 or so high school students, who were trying to pay individually.  Another server had brought our water over.  My wife has sensitive teeth, but I had forgotten to ask for water with no ice for her.  I tried to get the attention of the server, saying excuse me and waving my arms but he just kept walking to the back. The waiter finally came back with our order and I asked him if we could get a glass of water without ice, and after 5 minutes he brought it over.  My fish was a bit bland and had very little tarter on the bun, and I had forgotten to ask for extra tarter sauce for my fries. My wife was complaining to me that her fish didn't seem quite cooked enough, and asked if mine was the same.  I didn't think so, I told her, but I was so hungry at that point, I'm not sure I'd even notice.  She continued to eat, but I still needed some tarter for my bland fish. I tried to get the waiter's attention, as he looked right at me, then made a left turn to take a different route.  At first I thought he was assisting another customer, when after several minutes of not seeing him emerge, my informed me that he was back in the kitchen area, and that there were no customers in the section he had travelled. He had deliberately avoided me!   I got up and walked back to the prep area, looking around and opening a cooler cabinet, when the waiter came over to me and asked if he could help me.  I told him he could have helped me 10 minutes ago, when I was trying to get some more tarter sauce, but it appeared I was going to have help myself.  He said he would bring it out.  He didn't even offer an apology.     My wife told me she wanted some ketchup for her fries and then I realized that he didn't even offer to bring us any.  I got tired of waiting for him and got up to another table to get some. The waiter came back and asked if we wanted some more fries, and I said yes.  He hadn't walked 10 feet before coming back, and asked ""Did you say you wanted more fries?'   I said again yes.  I asked my wife, if I was talking to low that perhaps he didn't hear me.  She said I she understood perfectly well, and she was further away than the waiter. After dropping $30 bucks and such bad service I'd have to say we won't be back again, and probably not eat at Red Robin any more as a result.  I know it's a chain and I would hope other locations are better, but I'm not going to be saying Red Robin......................yum, anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redmond?start=80,3.2,3.2,3.2,2.568,3.2000000000000006

46,Jon L.,"Bellevue, WA",805,2131,9776.0,3.0,2013-02-23,"Taking one star back. Reason being the service here is a bit slow. It can take a while for the food to come out, especially if your group is large. It made sense that they did serve baskets of fries while the rest of the food was still being made. Today, had a Tavern double burger with bacon ($7.99) and an Irish beer shake ($4.59). The double burger is a smaller burger then the standard options, but paired with the bottomless fries, it is more than enough food. Especially if you get an app or drink. The burger was standardly good. Just what you would expect a burger with bacon to taste like. The bacon supposedly had an aioli, but I didn't taste it really. Shame as that would have took this burger to the next level. The Irish beer shake is a limited time drink available now, assumedly to culminate with the upcoming St. Patrick's Day. It is a mix of Guiness, Jameson whiskey and ice cream. Ingredients that can do no wrong. I wasn't sold on the drink at first, but it eventually won me over. Also, it is reasonably priced for a boozy shake. I would get this over a pint of beer. The food here is good. Though the service can be slow. Still I find this to be a great place for large groups to go since the restaurant is huge and the menu is crowd pleasing. Proximity to MS is also a nice selling point.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redmond?start=40,3.12,3.12,3.12,2.668,3.1200000000000006

I ordered the turkey baja club as a wrap - I didn't realize it was going to come out hot though so that was kind of strange.

My fiance had a rum and coke and it was strong but the rum didn't taste very good. Pretty standard Red Robin but I found the staff here to be better than at other RRs. The kitchen was quick and the drinks were good. Our waiter even stopped by just before happy hour was over to see if we wanted another drink, which was quite nice of him.

68,Negeen M.,"Bothell, WA",26,5,,2.0,2015-01-06,"I had a great time with good company. Bar was a comfortable nice setting. Nothing too impressive though. (But it is red robin)  Fried zucchini and mushrooms were delicious. We got the black and blue burger which was SUPER yummy.  To drink I had a martini which was decent, and my friend had a couple margeritas (which were super sweet-but some people like them that way). For how slow the bar was I felt like the drinks took kind of a long time to come out. But I know that sometimes when it's slow it's easy to lag a bit. But nothing too ridiculous.  Service and food and drinks were good. Nothing impeccable but it wasn't a BAD experience. So why only 2 stars? Well. I got my bill and apparently red robin charges for a ""double"" beverage when you get a martini. Which I asked about and was told that ""a martini IS a double"". (I have NEVER experienced that-it's a regular drink I get when going out). I didn't want to make a fuss. So I paid for my bill and left and proceeded to call all my bartender friends to ask if that is something they've encountered and all said NO.  In addition for anyone who is curious. A regular liquor drink has 1.5oz of alcohol. A shot is the same. 1.5oz. So a double would come out to 3oz. If I was getting 3oz of liquor in my martini 1)from what I've known to be true you cannot legally serve someone a DOUBLE when they order what is a single beverage. 2)a martini has 2oz of alcohol (which at any other establishment would require an extra dollar or 2 for the 1/2oz of extra liquor. 3) i also recall that you cannot charge someone for what they did not receive. And I did not receive 3oz of vodka. So I would like to know who drank that extra 1oz I paid for.  Yes I realize I went to red robin. Yes I realize this might be an overreaction. BUT it's the point that what they're doing is shady and could potentially be borderline illegal under laws in place by the liquor control board. When it comes to booze.

For the most part we've had a good experience, the staff has always been pleasant and attentive. Today, that was not the case. Our server  Hayley was dismissive and short with us, it may have been due to the restaurant being a little busier than usual but it's still no excuse to be impolite to your customers. Still, the service was not bad as she didn't have to do much. Just get our order and have someone bring it over. Well she even failed at this simple task as she spilled our drinks as she brought them and left without a word, leaving to clean her mess ourselves.  Though what irked my wife and I was when we ordered a meal to go for our kids. She seemed annoyed that we wanted something to go and had to jot down another order. We ordered a Burger(To be split in half) and two Vanilla Milkshakes.  Our order gets to us and the cups(about 16oz) are only a quarter full....and they charged us $4.99 for this(We had already paid for everything at this point). We complained to Hayley and told us that's ""just the way they are"" but that she would check in the Bar. She came back in less than a minute saying the Bartender told her ""that's all they get now"". We're obviously not happy but decided not to pursue it further since we didn't want them spitting in our food so we left. We get home and find the Burger wasn't split in half which we ended up doing ourselves but Also the Vanilla Milkshakes are actually Banana...so not only did we pay $10 for two milkshakes that wouldn't even fill up a zippy cup but it was also the wrong flavor.

58,Ieatfood A.,"Redmond, WA",0,27,71.0,5.0,2015-07-10,"In my opinion Red Robin is the Dennys of the Millenium, they're there. The one and only reason they get a 5 star rating from me, is their secret weapon, Wade! Honestly he's the one that keeps me coming back, he's attentive, and funny. We adore him. That's the reason we go in.  You can only find Wade working the bar area, so if you have children with you, I guess you're out of luck. Besides my favorite waiter, Red Robin has a few other tidbits going for them (again my opinion), their poppy seed honey mustard sauce, it's a go to / must for years. And their raspberry lime - aide non-alcoholic beverage (for those of us who have had alcohol reek havoc on their lives). It's expensive but comes with free refills. If I could suggest to Red Robin a few ideas- 1. Stop giving out balloons, they're terrible for the environment. I recently watched 2 boys playing outside with them (and one boys crutches) pop, pop, pop, and they just kept going back in for more balloons. Did I mention they didn't clean up their broken bits all over the place. I was fuming, and wanted to screm at them. Upon leaving I picked them up, so I knew it was done before they blew around more. So if you could find compostable balloons then ok, but otherwise please stop giving out balloons. 2. Please bring back the mountain high / mile high mud pie dessert WITH peanut butter. Offer both versions if you want.  I love peanut butter. I'm sorry that some people are allergic, but most of those people read the menu and contamination ect. I don't eat meat, but that doesn't stop you from having meat options all over the menu.

As for the food- if you haven't been to a RR in a while, you'll notice less of the traditional burgers, but more of these new ""premium"" burgers.  At $13-14 a pop, you can get a burger that tastes like what the traditional burgers once did.  Now, you get paper-thin bacon and thinner meat patties on the traditional burgers.  (they used to ask you for your cook preference)  Now they just come out medium and flavorless.   Now, for the saving grace- the fries!  Well, the last couple times I've been in, they were clearly sitting for a long time because they tasted like cardboard but were still sent out to my table.  I had to ask for more fries for everyone in our group, because at RR, even if your burger is ok, you know the bottomless fries are on point.  Not so much any more it seems.  What the hell is going on Red Robin?!  You've lost that personality and ecclectic vibe that made me always feel like I'd leave satisfied.  Now we've got touchscreens, tiered burger quality levels, pseudo-upscale decor, and shotty fries...   Sorry, but I've gotta take a break.  Bring the dirtybird back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redmond?start=40,2.44,2.87,2.87,2.44,2.6980000000000004

We stopped at this location mainly due to the close proximity to the hotel we stayed at.  While our server, Mercedes, was wonderful, and one of the best servers I have experienced in recent times, including at other Red Robin's, the issue remains the food.  10 years ago, Red Robin's had a two sided menu, and the food portions were large, the prices were always higher than a standard fair burger at a fast food join, but the value was there.  I always needed a doggie bag it seemed for my burger, and even for some of the fires, which I never needed to order a second helping of their bottomless fries.   Ever since Red Robin's went to a ""Applebee's"" style booklet for a menu, they are skimping on the portion sizes, and they give you about 10 French fries per serving with their bottomless Fries, making your plate look huge due to the freakishly small serving of fries in a metal cup.  My burger, while tasty, was small.  Much smaller than I remember Red Robin serving in the past.  I got the new special, a ""Southern Charms"" burger, which was with bacon, fried onions, BBQ sauce, and basically all the ""fixin's"" you'd want for a burger that has connotations to the south.  It was on a ciabatta bread bun.  In the past, the burgers were larger in volume.  Not this one.  I didn't even have to disengage my jaw to get my mouth around this burger.  The total for the two adult meals, and two children's meals was about $50.00.  No alcohol was purchased, but this is an expensive outing to me for a young family of four.  This is one of the reasons I do not frequent Red Robin's.  The second has been the bad or lack-there-of service, and finally, the portion sizes are too small now.   Overall, the food was disappointing in the portion size and the price.  Like I said, our server was the highlight, and this is not something to take lightly.  I tip based on service, not on the meal.  Read any of my restaurant reviews and it will reflect on how important good service is.  She is easily carrying one of the two stars that I gave for this Red Robin's!  She was busy training someone, but she checked in often, my water never once went dry, and she was engaging with my kids.  She did the order by memory, and did a fantastic job.  If you come here, don't expect much from the food, but ask for Mercedes to be your server.  You will be glad you did!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redmond?start=20,2.4,2.86,2.86,2.216,2.676

She came back with cold bleu cheese salad dressing, which was not at all enjoyable with the burger.  6) A child's birthday sundae was served to a 10 year old child without asking nor notifying the parents.

I was so disappointed tonight when I came in with my sisters to eat dinner there. As we walked in, we asked the hostess named Erica for a table for three. Erica then took us to seat us. We asked if we could get a different table and she looked at us with frustration. We asked if we can get a booth, she told us it wasn't available. We then asked if we can sit anywhere but the middle and she got more frustrated, rolled her eyes and said its your choice honestly, I have to go to the front. She then walked away. My siblings and I were shocked to see the treatment we got. We saw how she was talking to other customers, she was super kind and patient.

Swung by here for a quick dinner and surprisingly, at 5pm ish, there were plenty of seats out in the restaurant and in the bar. For the bar, it was open seating. My friend and I sat in the bar and overall, both of us had a pleasant time here. For food, we ordered: the pub mac and cheese, the bees kness (aka chicken and waffle sandwich), strawberry freckled lemonade, and some cheesy/spicy fries (forgot the name). For the fries appetizer, it was like eating a mini nachos with fries instead of chip. Loaded with a ton of cheese, bacon and some Jalapenos, this will definitely fulfill any immediate hunger you may have.  As for the mac and cheese, this dish was alright. It's cheesy but nothing too outstanding. As for the bees knees, the waffle is done Belgian style where it's super sweeeet. Combined with waffle with a slab of crispy chicken and bam! A mini sandwich awaits you. Personally, I found the dish to be too much for me but it was fun to try something different on the RR menu. For service, our server was on point. From delivering re-fills of our drinks without us asking to making sure everything went alright, I really do appreciate our server's effort in making this a pleasant dining experience.

REALLY?!  management, if you read this bad review (which i highly doubt they will), you probably know who we're talking about because i don't believe we were the only ones to experience her lousy service skills. please either retrain her properly or she needs to move onto another profession where she doesn't actually have to deal with people or earn a tip... because she isn't doing so. g'bye.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-redmond?start=40,2.8,2.82,2.82,2.148,2.812

Anyway, I'm standing there for a good 3 or 4 minutes as the dude behind the counter looks at me a few times but doesn't say anything.  He helps 2 gentlemen who weren't there when I walked in and another gentlemen who was there.   As he's running around another lady asks if I've been helped and when I reply no, she says the dude (who was behind the counter) was getting all the to go food from the kitchen.   I wait around another 3-4 minutes as he helps everyone else but me.   Finally, he asks me if I was (not my name).  I say no and that lady walks in and picks up her food.   Then I give him my name, and my food was literally sitting there the whole time.    So, already being irritated, I mention that it has been sitting there since before I walked in to start and how is it going to remain hot if its been sitting out?  He gets flustered and I guess the manager heard and walked over.  They asked if I wanted it remade, but I had already been there at least 10 minutes by that point.  The manager tried to give me the  - its in a hot box - argument.....which sure it was.  It was also sitting right near doors that open and close every time someone walks in and out.  I decided to take the food because honestly I didn't have the time to wait around.
