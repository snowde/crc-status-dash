201,George L.,"Renton, WA",0,1,,1.0,2012-01-23,"This place is TERRIBLE.  It all started with the floor, it was super slippery from being covered in grease.  You could tell that it had been weeks since anyone had bothered mopping the place.              Moving on, We were seated at a table that was completely broken,  just resting my hand on the table was enough to cause it to nearly topple over. How did they expect me to eat off of this?  After informing our waitress that this would not do, we moved to a booth.            After moving to the booth we were now being ignored by our waitress, presumably because we were no longer seated in her section.  We ended up having to wait another 15 minutes for another waitress to notice we were there, and this was on a rather slow night.  Whatever, we order our food and drinks.            10 minutes later our waitress returns to inform us that they do not have any regular white bread hamburger buns for the burger my date ordered.  A hamburger joint without hamburger buns, are you serious?  They do apparently have some other buns they can use though, so my date agrees to whatever their substitution is.              Our dinner comes out a short while later,  and a server drops off our food minus the silverware I need.  What do they expect me to do, go caveman style on it?  No problem just asked the next employee that passed by for some silverware.  Should I really need to ask for silverware?       Now for the food itself.  The chicken I ordered was cold, maybe room temperature at best.  What do they do, pull it out of a freezer and stick it in a microwave for 30 seconds?  It sure tasted like it.   Same story on the Burger my date ordered, she said it tasted like it was sitting out all night.       After eating what little of our food we could stomach our waitress promptly brought us our check and took our plates. The waitress must have known how bad the food was to not even bother asking if we wanted to take our left overs home.  She didn't even bother asking us if we wanted desert  or perhaps more drinks?   Which we did as we were still hungry from the less than appetizing dinner.  She came back after she saw we were looking at the drink menu and we ordered a desert that long story short was just as disappointing as the rest of the meal.               To top everything off on the way out my date slipped and fell on their greasy slippery floor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-renton?start=180,3.52,3.52,3.52,2.724,3.5200000000000005

159,Meaghan B.,"Tacoma, WA",43,243,9.0,3.0,2012-04-10,"Oh, Red Robin. I want to like you. I really do.  The thing is, you keep letting me down.  You see, the thing is that we have food allergies and a kid.  I'm aware that's hard - I'm cool with a lot of questions, a little bit of a longer wait and that lovely $1 surcharge you tack on to each item for an ""allergy alert.""  Well, that is I would be if you would actually pay attention to the order.  The first step is getting the allergy menu - which they never seem to have handy and changes every month. If you get one, keep it if you are likely to come back - it's a print-out and they throw them away after each diner. Good news: they have gluten-free soy-free dairy-free buns from Udi's. Bad news: They frequently forget and send the burger on a regular bun and then slide it over to the gluten-free bun when you point it out (food allergies don't work this way, folks.)  Or they burn the bun. Or they accidentally put those shoestring onions (batter-dipped and deep-fried) on it.   No problem, you say, I'll just go the standard gluten-free route and order a salad - no croutons.  Good luck getting them to leave the Red Robin seasoning (gluten and soy contained within) off of it, especially if you don't order a dressing. Watch croutons be picked off of the salad, crumbs still visible. Additional hiccups we've had:  a waitress pressuring my two year old to finish his plate, ""you wouldn't want to upset Mommy, right?"" Hey, lady, food police your own kids - mine eats pretty well and I never, ever pressure him to finish anything. Plus, he's _two_ - I don't think he's capable of clearing his meal at Red Robin. We can box it up and take it home if it is that important to you.  waitstaff disappearing for 30 minutes at a time during that post-lunchtime-lull. Ever try waiting at a table for a check with a two year old who was done eating twenty-five minutes ago? the diet-soda switchout. I can't drink diet soda. Yuck it up all you'd like about how the fat lady is allergic to diet soda, but I'd prefer to make it home without a seizure. Once I asked ""is this diet? It tastes off."" to be reassured it was not, then had a reaction anyway; the second time I didn't fully notice until I was mid-reaction. Thankfully, both times I was not driving the car. I now order unsweetened iced tea. This location is a bit noisier than other locations I've been to - which is saying something. Come prepared to sign or shout or jot notes or something. Why do I keep coming back?  Well, food allergies are tough to deal with. Most places that can even handle food allergies aren't kid friendly - think ""bistro."" So, this is our *one* available, reasonably priced place for a kid-friendly, kid-approved dinner or lunch out.  We'll be back again, I'm sure; forever with the hope that they'll finally notice on the line when it says ""ALLERGY ALERT.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-renton?start=160,3.52,3.52,3.52,2.8280000000000003,3.5200000000000005

138,Elena M.,"Seattle, WA",48,511,22.0,3.0,2012-05-21,"Sorry, RR, but you're getting taken down a notch. Stopped in the other night for a late night nosh.  My husband specifically wanted to go to RR so he could get a plate of nachos.  So, he was disappointed to see that RR recently changed its menu and is no longer serving nachos.   (He was so disappointed, in fact, that had we not already ordered and been served drinks, we would have just left.) If it was just that one menu change, the star would probably still be in tact.  But, we noticed a lot of other changes, too, that did not please us.  For example, there used to be a number of pasta dishes on the menu, and these are also no longer there.  Now, I admit, 90% of the time when I go to RR, I order a chicken sandwich of some sort -- and my husband orders a burger.  But, it was nice to have the other dishes as a menu option -- for example, when one of us was in the mood for his/her ""usual"" and other was not.  Having these no longer available will probably mean we do not go to RR as often. Also, on the night when my husband did not eat the no-longer-available nachos, I was not feeling particularly hungry and so just ordered a bowl of the chicken tortilla soup.  And, it was a good thing I was not feeling particularly hungry because the serving was small!  Really small!  So small, in fact, I had to ask if it was really the ""bowl"" I'd ordered as  I thought I might have accidentally been served a ""cup"" instead.  A bowl of soup should be a small meal, not a side dish.  And this was definitely side dish size.  I shudder to think of what the ""cup"" looks like.  Also, the soup was not served with a roll or even a couple of lousy saltines.  It has definitely been my experience elsewhere that soup is usually served with something of that ilk.. Our server was a good sport and put up with all our griping.  But, the evening, overall, was a disappointment.  RR is one of our mainstays and we will be back.  It just might be a while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-renton?start=140,3.32,3.32,3.32,2.8280000000000003,3.3200000000000003

I think my boyfriend's burger was wrapped in lettuce because of the gluten intolerance he mentioned, but they still allowed him to order a burger that included breaded fish. He didn't realize that it would be breaded, and the employee apparently didn't think about it. We've encountered one other RR employee (in Woodinville) who WAS super careful when it came to allergies/intolerances, but looks like that's probably not the norm.

142,Duwon C.,"Seattle, WA",68,54,3.0,2.0,2013-08-11,"One of the worst overall dining experiences I've had in a long time. It starts off with us ordering drinks, of course. My lady friend asks for a Sprite and I ask for a water. Guess what we end up getting?? We Both get some kind of carbonated drink that is clearly neither water nor Sprite. We mention this to one of the waitresses and she takes our drinks and after about 10 minutes she comes back with what tasted more like Sprite but still didn't seem entirely so. Since when do restaurants water down soft drinks? Our waitress was extremely awkward and borderline rude; I suspect she was a new employee but even so, shouldn't kindness and a smile be present even if she hasn't yet memorized the menu? She would come ask us if we needed anything: the first time, she held her hands together and she asked me in a way that made me feel like I was her boss, like she feared I was going to shout at her. She spoke barely audible and with the loud atmosphere that is typical of Red Robins, made communicating with her difficult. The second time she asks us if we're alright, we were eating and clearly had no drinks on the table (another waitress had taken them to replace). How does she not notice this? We're eating without any drinks... Food was ok, I got an average burger and mac & cheese that had no flavor whatsoever while my companion got a chicken burger which she herself said was too small, and this is coming from someone that weighs about 90 lbs.

When the short tempered older woman at the bar ended up helping him, she was not personable at all.

When we got our check the orders were wrong and when I told her she needed to put my burger on my check she blamed it on her manager. When I had gotten the ""corrected"" check she had added a drink I didn't order onto my check. I asked her to fix it again but my card has three charges on it now.

117,Madison G.,"Seattle, WA",23,286,318.0,2.0,2014-05-28,"This location seems to be extremely slow for no apparent reason. Believe me when I say I am not one of those customers who come in to a full restaurant that is extremely busy and expect my food within 5 minutes of sitting down. It doesn't matter what the restaurant looks like though - whether there is 4 tables seated or 14. It takes incredibly long to get our food and even ice water! Our last experience was the worst and most likely the reason I won't return to this location. When we arrived, there were only 2 other tables seated. While ordering and then a little bit afterwards, it got pretty busy. They probably sat 6 or 7 more parties afterwards. After waiting for a long time to even get our water, I started noticing that all the tables were receiving their food. When my boyfriend asked about this, one girl told us our order was lost in the system and that they'd have it come right out. Not sure how it was lost if they got our appetizers and were able to put our order in again without us telling them what we ordered, but whatever. Then, another girl came to apologize and said the manager was taking care of our bill since we had to wait so long. Cool! Once we finally got our food, we again waited several minutes to get a refill of water and napkins. Finally the bill came out and they removed our $6 appetizer, but definitely did not ""take care of the bill"" as they said.

I understand it is a holiday but everyone seemed to be getting service just fine besides us.  We were the first table seated in our row. Server named Jessica came up right away and asked if we were ready. After asking for some time it took her a whole 20 mins to come back and get our orders. One of our burgers was incorrect,  no big deal to us, it happens. We asked for more fries while we waited for the order to be corrected,  they never came. 20 mins later we got the correct burger and still had to repeat the order for the fries 2 more times after! We never were asked for refills. The tables next to us came and went and we were still waiting for fries and then by then we wanted the check so we could leave. The place was so busy with food orders racking up at the kitchen that the manager was helping them run food yet no one else seemed to want to help get food out faster. Some just stood there yelling at people. No team work at all. Next the checks were incorrect.  We nicely let her know to move just one item to a different tab. We had two checks yet she would only give us one itemized receipt.  2nd time she brought us the corrected checks they were even more messed up and I physically had to write down who was paying for what on a piece of paper for her!  3rd time and 3 charges later she handed us 3 different receipts with 3 different prices and still only one itemized receipt! No steps taken to make sure everything was clear. We then took our issue to the manager who said quote ""well you confused her when you started changing everything"".

We then got up and moved to one of the tables in the bar area hoping to get some better service and we were not talked to by anyone for literally 15 minutes.

108,Debra Y.,"Renton, WA",0,22,,1.0,2014-07-14,"I am giving them one star, only because the manager followed us out, to ask us if there had been a problem.  Where do I begin? Let me start by saying I really like Red Robin.  This was the second time I've been to this location at Renton Landing, and NEVER AGAIN!!!  My first visit was on a Saturday evening, and I attributed the poor service and wrong order to the staff being overwhelmed by the weekend crowd, and the fact they had just recently opened.  Our waitress was not friendly, the fries were cold, and we received the wrong burgers.  We decided we could deal with the burgers, but asked for hot  fries.  Our waitress all but grabbed our baskets from us, and slammed down some new ones about 15 minutes later.  She was mad???  We ate, left and hoped things would get better once the staff got rolling.  Seems things have only gotten worse.  I visited again today with my daughter and grandchildren, and it was one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had.  We were greeted by an unsmiling ""hostess,"" who became hostile when we requested a booth.  She seemed to need to confer with a young man who appeared to be the greeter.  She told us there was only one booth we could sit in, despite the restaurant being practically empty.  She took us to a booth right outside the restroom, and when I sat down, I sank into a large ""hole"" in the seat.   It appeared the springs had broken.  Since we were obviously being ignored, we finally got up and moved to a nearby booth.  Finally, our sassy little waitress (who appeared very put out) came over.  I apologized for moving, and explained the problem with the seat.  She made no eye contact, and informed us that ""lots of people sit in that booth, and it's fine.""  With that, she slammed some water on the table and left.  Even her thick silver eyeshadow couldn't make up for her bad manners!  We decided we weren't sticking around for the next scene, and walked out.  The manager caught up with us once we were out the door, and we told him about our experience.  He asked us to come back in, and offered to buy our meal.  We declined.  We walked down to the new Torero's, where we were greeted by a smiling hostess, shown to a booth, and had a delicious meal!  Our waitress was wonderful, and we left her a nice tip.  I am truly baffled as to why the manager of the Red Robin allows his restaurant to operate in such a shoddy manner.  He is responsible for his staff, and desperately needs to train and oversee them the way someone in his position should.  Chasing down the customers as they walk out, is like locking the barn door after the horse gets loose.

188,Danica T.,"Lake Stevens, WA",1,7,,1.0,2014-08-18,"This was honestly the worst Red Robin experience we had ever experienced and the restaurant was not even busy. When we arrived, the hostess had her back turned to the door and was leaning over the podium like she was bored. When she finally acknowledged us, she blandly asked how many in our party and never showed a hint of a smile or greeting. After waiting a few minutes, I took my daughter to the bathroom and left my boyfriend to grab our table when ready. Upon our return to the front, I discovered that two groups of people who came in after us were seated by a different host who came up  and ignored that our party was there (while the other hostess was still there and did not intervene), this young man was also bland and didn't seem to care about his patrons either. I suggested we go somewhere else at this point, but we decided to just stay since it couldn't be TOO much longer. After about a twenty minute wait, while at least four booths and three tables had been open the entire time, we were finally seated, and when we asked for a booth instead of a table arrangement, the hostess acted as though we were a huge nuisance, and reluctantly with a huff and  puff seated us in an OPEN booth in an area that was already being served, 'so not in a sectioned off for the next rush area'. The server was thankfully friendly and smiley, though lacked attentiveness, we ordered, and ended up waiting another 30 mins for two salads and a child's mac and cheese. To make matters worse, the child's mac and chesse and fries were cold. We asked a bus boy nearby for some assistance, and he looked like he was frightened we even spoke to him. To be clear, we are very patient respectful people.  The bus boy got the manager, who thanked us for letting him know about the child's meal as this had happened already FOUR times that same day... the manager actually admitted that to us. I don't normally feel a need to give negative reviews, but this experience was just terrible. I truly hope they can get their staff on board with the way every other Red Robin operates and soon.

I ordered the cod fish sandwich and my mom ordered one of the ""gourmet"" burgers. She ordered her burger medium rare and Im not even sure why they asked as it came medium well. The patty was mushy with some unappetizing sautéed/carmalized union ontop a bun with an onion ring ontop amd a steak knife stuck through the entire burger. The steak knife happened to be the only utensil we received and later had to ask for napkins. My mom said it was one of the worst burgers she had ever had. My cod sandwich was tasteless, gooey and they skimped on the tarter sauce. I couldnt even taste it. We never got our ""bottomless fries"" that the menu had talked about.

But after my experience today, I don't know if I'll ever visit a Red Robin again.  We attended the one at the landing in renton tonight for my cousins 15th birthday. There were about 15 of us at a table. It started out great; got our drinks and appetizers fast. Halfway through my drink I noticed my glass was dirty; caked on food near the top, I was extremely grossed out. Then came our meals...... I ordered the clucks and fries buffalo style. Now I've ordered this plenty of times and each time it comes cooked in buffalo sauce. Mine came out as regular strips and two cups of sauce on the side. I told him and not only did he not offer to take it back but the sauce looked and tastes like 90% oil, 10% buffalo sauce. Then my uncle who ordered buffalo wings, ( which he got 15 mins after everyone already got their food) came out with just.... Drumroll..... Sauce on ONE wing. Sent it back. They put sauce on two more wings .* rolls eyes*  During the meal, none of us got refills unless we stopped him and asked for one. On top of that we didn't get napkins until AFTER we finished eating. Not one time did the waiter clear any of our plates, even our appetizer plates were on the table when we left. He brought our desert out with the tables full of empty plates and glasses.

We LOVE Red Robin - their bruschetta chicken and their whiskey river bbq burger is delicious, paired with their bottomless fries with ranch and campfire sauce on the side.  This location is all fine and dandy if you're here just to hang out and look at the menu. The waiters and waitresses are rude, and to go orders take LONGER than if you were to stay and eat. I will say that i have not experienced the ""restaurant"" side of the building - we have only ever eaten in the bar.  The last (and final) time we ate there - well, tried to, was on a Saturday night at 10 pm. Literally sat down at ten in the bar (they close at 11) at a table right across from the actual bar. There were probably 4 other customers (couples or families) in the bar area. The waitress came over, took my boyfriends' drink order (one beer) while i said i'd just have water for now. Literally 25 minutes later, we are still waiting on his beer. The waitress had walked past us twice without saying a word, not to mention a couple of other employees. The two bartenders are chatting to themselves. The couple that sat down behind my boyfriend that had walked in after us had already received their drinks and had their order taken. He gets frustrated. I get impatient. He wants to leave. I say ""Five more minutes. If at ten thirty, if she doesn't come back, we're leaving."" Ten Thirty rolls around and we get up, i grab my purse, and walk out. The two bartenders stop talking and look at us, but say nothing.  We've gone to the Tukwila location since then, and they have been excellent. Food well cooked, employees have a great attitude and are happy to recommend their favorite choices. Never too busy.

I ordered the blue American (I think) and the onion buns were so large you could not taste any parts of the burger. I could barely taste the blue cheese, and it was extremely sloppily made.

59,Sir S.,"Seattle, WA",0,15,31.0,2.0,2015-04-12,"It's gonna sound like a broken record, reiterating much of what some recent review have said about this RR. Great location , salty fries , inattentive server , indifferent service , badly made burger , dirty bathroom . Aside from the location part, it's pretty negative.  I've patronized RR for over 30 yrs, I feel I'm qualified to complaint. The last couple of times to this particular locale has got to be the worst (food-wise) in all my experience with RR. From the get-go, the maitre'd seem genuinely surprised that two adults don't want to sit at the bar. No bad attitude, just a surprised look on her face. Then came our server, D, who seemed all flustered before even greeting us. Must've been a busy busy shift. Everything from burgers to fries were very (extremely) salty. Hey, aren't we all suppose to eat healthier, cutting down on the sodium?! Apparently the line cooks decided we were all salt-deprived. Patties were way under-cooked. Also I literally spent more time waiting for food, drinks and our server than eating my dinner. As some of her tables starts emptying out, she got harder to track down. Forgetting the requests for sauces, refills on fries and drinks (even after acknowledging our requests). I know wait-staffs work hard, but I'm not in a habit of training or tracking them. The attitude of the staffs were cordial, if not pleasant; which is alright with me. And maybe the only saving grace for this RR. My last time here was last year around March. Why so long between visits? That last time here, their kitchen ""crashed"". Why? I don't know. But when you see the manager cooking and wait-staff all confused, it can't be good. Again, their attitude was the only thing preventing a 1-star rating.

The floors were slick and disgusting from food. The fries were cold when we got our food. Our middle girl asked for more Mac & cheese since it is a free refill item and she loves the stuff. The waiter ordered it but it never came before we were ready to leave and so she never got it.

When did they start giving you a pathetic amount of fries? i ordered a 14$ burger and it arrived with literally 10-12 fries on the plate. i asked for some more ( you know trying to capitalize on the ""bottomless"" aspect) after another almost ten minutes our server returned. with another basket with literally 9 fries in it. I know theyre probably used to people taking advantage of the fries but COME ON, im a grown man paying over 20$ for a meal and a beer and you cant give me a decent portion of fries??",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-renton?start=80,2.48,2.42,2.42,2.216,2.444

At first I thought it was me, but upon reading other reviews first I realize I was not simply being picky.  Twice now I had visited Red Robin in two different locations and found the problems to be exactly the same. They are slow, not like ""I had to wait 10 minutes to order"" but just super slow from taking the order, bringing the food, getting a server, getting the basics like water and napkins"" not to mention even cashing out took awhile... The service was terrible, me and my husband made the most of it and laughed it off but we knew we were never coming back.  Places like this never change, there is no chance it will. It will only steadily get worse until the customers are gone and a new resturant takes over.  We were seated and waited, waited, waited. I don't blame the waitress but management at this point. How do you not know how to hire enough to keep the place moving? The food was delicious, but thats for the one star. And oh yeah, those bottomless fries they like to advertise about? You never see them. If you can wait it out for about an hour you will get about 18 fries in total . Apart of me wants to believe its because of revenue and other people eating more fries than food, but it just feels really cheap tactic and a sign of the times with the economy.  Make sure when you come you bring napkins because this place is so cheap and slow you might not ever see one...

The reason why Red Robin gets my business is because for $10, I know whatever entree I get, it'll fill me up. The burgers itself are huge already, but when you add in bottomless fries to the meal(they cut you off at some point if you are being unreasonable greedy), it's a lot of food. I'm a huge fan of their fries, thick steak cut fries, it's probably my favorite. Their honey mustard and camp fire sauce is on point to dip with anything whether it be fries, chicken strips, or burgers. They have a house seasoning that you can also purchase to bring home. Their freckled lemonade is also great.  This is probably one of the first useful addition of the Renton Landing before it bloom to what it is right now, it's close by the Regal Cinemas so convenience if you were to make this a casual dinner & movie type of deal. During the summers and holidays, they extend their hours.  There's plenty of parking around as this is in the Landing, it might be a bit harder to find super close spots on the weekends, but you will find one.

84,Destinysands ..,"Shoreline, WA",0,6,,1.0,2015-12-28,"We went in on the 26th of December after running errands. It was decently busy, however it was outside of Lunch or Dinner (in between) so not terrible and no wait at all (bar was about 60% full and restaurant about the same). We sat in the bar and it took almost 10 minutes for us to be able to order drinks from one of the 3 people behind the bar. Got drinks fairly quickly and then ordered food. I told the server that I was having blood sugar issues and would like my fry ""refill"" right away. It took 30+ minutes, and it all came out at the same time.  30+ minutes for two burgers, one of which was a garden burger that takes about 2 minutes to heat up (and was barely warm when I got it)..... Food tasted good, although it would have been nice for the server to come back and ask how it was. Or offer us more fries, etc., before we started to pay.  With the amount of time it took to get the food, I started looking around at all the decor. That is when I noticed the huge amount of dust and cobwebs on all of the wall art, ceilings, ceiling fans, window sills, wall molding, blinds, etc. It was disgusting! I walked to the restroom and the remainder of the restaurant did not appear to have this much ick. Seemed odd.  I called the manager over as I was about to go out the door and pointed out the cobwebs and dust to him. He said that the dust was from the construction during their recent renovation - which was months ago. I asked then where were the cobwebs from that had obviously taken a long time to collect that many (I even took pictures of it because it was so gross and I couldn't believe it). He had no answer.  It is obvious that this store does not care at all or take pride in its appearance. They are in a busy location and it appears that think that as long as they are making money, why should they care? There are so many other places to eat at the landing that cares about guests and the cleanliness of their restaurants - go somewhere else. If you are really craving RR, there are plenty of others in the area that you can get to within 15 minutes or so that care about cleanliness and customer service and food wait time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-renton?start=80,2.48,2.32,2.32,2.18,2.384

The service our party was provided tonight was extremely friendly. Our waitress, Teri, was very approachable and personable. For example, after our table finished coloring the pictures provided with the kids menus (we're all children at heart), we asked Teri whose picture she thought was the best. This just shows how easy she was to talk to!  She made sure we were comfortable and that we had everything we needed.  Lastly, the food was AMAZING. This may sound like something small, but the meat patty in the burgers was bigger than the burger itself, and there was enough cheese to cover the entirety of the patty. This, therefore, prevents us from eating just bun.  Also, you definitely become full for what you pay for, and you don't have to worry about eating your money's worth.

She became so annoyed that I hesitated from ordering a fourth refill. (By contrast, I usually make it through a seventh or eighth refill of fries--with no complaint.) She also chastised my friends when they ordered a second refill. On my most recent visit, I asked for the BBQ Chicken Wrap without the chicken. (I'm a vegetarian.) She let out a frustrated laugh and then, when she brought me my food, said, ""Here's your SALAD WRAP,"" and then let out a mocking laugh. I was visibly embarrassed.

The only prompt thing was the water, which I got over my leg and table as she set it in front of me. She didn't even acknowledge the spill, which, at the moment, I was willing to overlook as a mistake by an overworked staff member. Twenty five minutes later, we got a salad with rotten lemons, a greasy-soggy burger, and my soup. Another five minutes to get the full order after we pointed out that my wife was missing her dressing. She did drop by to check a couple of times, which earned her brownie points, but the kicker was the time needed to pay the check: seven minutes to get the check after asking for it (I was timing it by then), fifteen more for me to go looking for my credit card I the kitchen area. That was after being told by the diners at the table beside us that they had received it with their checks, and that was when the manager was doing their close-out. Five years ago they were ok. They always got something wrong with our order, but they were always prompt, courteous, and had reasonably tasty food. It's been several years that they've grown progressively slower, more disorganized, harried, and even a little hostile.

My complaint and lack of two stars was given because every single time we order To-Go, the food is always mediocre or the order is wrong. I'm not sure why anyone would think that 11 cold fries is a decent side for anything. Honestly, they should do what Applebee's does and bring the food out to you when you park. By doing this, maybe you can take a large scoop/handful of fresh fries and dump them in the container right before taking the food out. It just seems like a better way to go. Also, I recently chose coleslaw instead of fries, and it came with literally NO dressing on it. The campfire sauce for my husband's fries was forgotten and my burger was just okay. Hardly any onion straws and it was super sloppy. Not worth the price. This never happens inside when we sit down. Again, I have no idea what the issue is.

I came here a couple times before and I noticed they always forgot a couple things in my orders, like a soup, extra sides, etc. Nevertheless, I decided to give them another chance. Yesterday however was absolutely horrible. I went in for to-go to get a quick grab before I went to work. It was a little after lunch time, around 2:30pm, I put my order through the bartender girl and asked how long it would take since I had to quickly go to work right after. She told me it would only be15 mins which is reasonable so I paid and waited. After 15 minutes passed, I checked with the bartender and she told me they were packing my order so it would be out soon. Another 15 minutes later I wait by the table and the bartender gives me looks but doesn't even check on my order. I asked a server passing by if he could just quickly check my order since I waited 30 minutes. At this point I was running late so I asked them if it wasn't ready yet then I might have to refund the money since I had to go to work soon since it was way past the wait time they told me it would be. The bartender, ""oh so attentive"", overhears me talking to the server, stops the drinks she was making and stomps over to me and yells ""I told you. I said earlier the food was coming, it's getting packed. I told you this already, it's coming okay?"" with her fingers pointing and shaking at me. This obviously raised a lot of attention making the place really uncomfortable and for me, really shocked that she was being extremely rude. I understand she was a bit busy so she was probably frustrated but don't ever, EVER give your customer an attitude. You represent the business. I told her that she didn't need to give me an attitude and she rolled her eyes, gave me the bitchiest look and went back to tending the bar.

You can order food, pay your tab, or order games for the kids to play at about 1.99 per game.  The kids menu has many choices to choose from and decently priced choices. The drinks are free to refill, so feel free to order as many chocolate milks as your child can handle. My children ordered the pepperoni pizza and mandarin oranges. They didnt seem to like the microwave pizza but could tolerate the fries. My husband and I had onion rings, a chicken ceaser wrap, and chicken club sandwich. Each dish was okay. I thought the wrap was a bit stale and not so fresh. Tbe onion rings were probably the best thing we ate there tonight. But hey its Red Robin, we enjoyed the family time at the end of the night.  I cannot forget  to rate the service. We had a very polite waitress. It was packed so service was slow, understandably.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-renton,2.56,2.34,2.34,2.088,2.428
39,Helen H.,"Seattle, WA",0,4,1.0,1.0,2016-04-15,"I have been to this particular Red Robin a handful of times and had very little problems with the quality of the food or service. However, earlier today (around 4pm) my mother and I decided to go. When we entered it was pretty slow, there were many open booths, and tables. The hostess/waitress asked for my name and encouraged my mother and I to have a seat in the lobby.  Two men that entered after us were also greeted but were immediately asked by the waitress where they would like to be seated. My mother was very disappointed by this, however, I assumed there must be a good/reasonable reason why they would try to accommodate them even though we arrived first.  In the entire 15 minutes we sat in the lobby, two waitresses stood behind the front podium talking amongst themselves. They even discussed very loudly where they should seat my mother and I (even though there was an entire empty seating section). Finally, the waitress acknowledged us and sat us at a corner table right beside the front lobby. After placing the menus on the table, the waitress walked away. My mother and I looked at each other in complete shock at the lack of courtesy and service. Moments later we decided to leave in order to avoid further issues.

Our waitress was very nice, but we just didn't see much of her, so we had to get some items ourselves or ask different waitress at times. Maybe they were short staffed? But it took way too long to order, and then way too long to get our items given the place was half empty, and then a long time to pay also. I also asked for a gluten-free bun for my chicken burger, but it was as hard as a rock. I think I could have used it to hammer in nails if needed, and the sweet potato fries were very soggy.

BUT - this location? No. I'm actually sitting in the restaurant as I'm typing this Yelp review. When we first came in, no one greeted us. The person who wrote our names down for the wait time was the only nice person we came in contact with all night. The female who sat us was rude. The server was okay, didn't really bother with us, which was kind of a ""whatever"" kind of thing. He took our order & we waited. At least 4 other families came in AFTER us (over 5 people in each family) and they all received their food before us. We waited 45 minutes for our food. I, myself, am not a prude when it comes to mistakes in the kitchen or mistakes on the waiter's behalf.. However, no one informed us about anything that was going on. If the waiter would've just informed us that he made a mistake or the kitchen made a mistake I would've been fine. Things happen. I spoke to a female manager & she basically just rudely brushed us off. She said she was going to check on what was going & never came back. The waiter came out with the food & still no explanation on what was going on. Placed the food down & left. We ate, the food was COLD. The waiter came back, gave us the bill & we finally asked him why it took so long. Apparently the kitchen was so busy, they lost our ticket. We told him we were upset & he brought a different manager out who took off $10 off our $35 bill. Honestly, after such a horrible experience I'm upset I had to pay them, period.

My bad, I should have complained at the time, but was so tired and bleary eyed, things did not register with me til we got home. NO. 1)  Stupid Trivia game.. saw it, thought it might be fun, so played a little.  WE WERE BILLED $1.99 FOR THIS!  WHAT??? i did not see it posted anywhere that it had a cost...SCREW THAT!  Not worth $2 to play some dumb electronic trivia. 2). Waiter said my birthday burger had to come from the Gourmet burger page.  So hubs and I both looked ONLY at THAT PAGE.  I ordered a California... my hubs said the Blue Cheese, and POINTED TO THE ONE THAT WAS $10.95 ON THAT PAGE. The waiter then said ""Oh, the Black and Blue?""?.  We don't know their menu, so my hubs said ""yeah, sure"".  SCREW THAT, the waiter ""tricked"" us into a $14 burger instead. 3) PAYING THE BILL;  You now pay on these electronic  terminals on the tables (which have the trivia games)...  It asked about tip and I slid the green arrow to 20%.  At home I REALIZED THEY CHARGED ME $9.70 ON A $36 BILL!   That is almost 30%.  WHAT!!! I HATE THE ELECTRONIC terminals....   Your receipt/bill comes out of that... I want a bill that lists what we ordered, what it costs and allows me to fill in any amount I freaking feel like for a tip. We won't be back!  Screw those new terminals, and their sneaky charges.  We specifically went there because our budget is really tight right now and I had the free burger... but it ended up costing a lot more than we planned!   Must say I do love their burgers and fries... but not all these other issues!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-renton?start=20,2.6,2.38,2.38,1.9600000000000002,2.468
19,Jordan N.,"Renton, WA",71,128,165.0,4.0,2016-05-15,"First off, I must say I was really sad when the chain took out the cheeseburger sliders from their appetizer menu. That was my go-to back then and didn't like the fact that I had to choose something else to order from that point on. Otherwise, this is the spot to go to if you want gourmet burgers for a decent price, and it has been a great addition to the Landing. I always say I'll order something new every time but I always get the Prime Chophouse because nothing else on the menu really appeals to me. I feel like I can never finish it in one sitting! This burger is unique because it has onion straws, horseradish, and even topped with a free onion ring! Their fries are pretty good also, and they're bottomless so dig in! Sadly, they don't give them to you in a basket anymore, they're trying to be fancy and give the food on a small tray and doesn't really give you a lot of fries to begin with so you might need to ask for more right when you get your food if you know you'll eat a lot of them. I've always been too full for dessert until last night, I was craving more dessert than a burger. We ordered a chocolate brownie cake topped with vanilla ice cream and a berry drizzle. I wish it was a bit more moist but still yummy nonetheless! I gotta give a shoutout to our server Brooke last night thought. She was super sweet, kept checking up on us, and reminding us that our drinks/dessert will be on their way soon. If you ever eat at the Landing location, try to make this girl your server! I don't eat at Red Robins that often anymore, I had my rewards card for years but I feel like I only eat here on my birthday or some random occasion.

69,Kim H.,"Hansville, WA",1,62,,1.0,2016-05-31,"Our first time at this location and definitely our last. 1.) We had a large party of 12, so we called as we were leaving home and told them we would be there in 30 minutes. The hostess said no problem, she put us on the list and start getting our table ready. It would only be a 5 minute wait once we got there. We arrived on time and found out that after we called a baseball team came in, so they gave our table to them. We then had to wait for 40 minutes to be seated. 2.) While we were waiting, we saw an ad for a gift card deal: purchase X amount in gift cards and get free tickets to see the new X-men movie. Great! We were planning on spending a large amount and a member of that party was planning on seeing the movie later that week. We went up to the front desk and purchased $200 in gift cards. AFTER the transaction was processed, the restaurant employee told us that they couldn't be used for 24 hours. That information would have been helpful before spending $200. The manager came over and processed refund. Its been 3 days and the money still hasn't been put back in the account that was used to purchase the gift cards. 3.) About half of our party ordered milkshakes or root beer floats and the other half ordered water or lemonade. The waters and lemonades were brought to the table within 5 minutes. 10 minutes after those had been delivered, we asked the waiter how much longer our milkshakes/floats would be and he said, ""Oh didn't I tell you? Our ice cream machine is broken."" I'm not sure if he took our orders knowing full well that he couldn't deliver them, or if he found out afterwards and just didn't tell us. 4.) Since we had arrived hungry and waited 40 minutes longer than we had expected, we were starving by the time we sat down. To keep the 6 kids in our party happy, we asked for 4 orders of bottomless fries right away. The kids devoured the fries and we asked for more (they're bottomless fries, right?) We never got any more fries. We must have asked our server at least 5 times and even grabbed another employee and asked for some, but they never came. Our server kept saying, ""Oh, let me go grab those fries for you"" but he never came back with fries. 5.) I'm not sure if our server was overworked or just bad at his job, but after our food was delivered he disappeared. We all finished eating and sat there for 20 minutes, waiting for the bill. Finally one of our party got up and searched the restaurant for our server to ask him for a bill and some boxes. He brought the bill but no boxes. I got fed up and just walked straight back into the kitchen and got the boxes myself. The one positive of this experience? The food we got was pretty good. Although it seems this was more due to luck than anything else, as the woman at the table next to us was served a completely blackened chicken burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-renton?start=60,2.64,2.42,2.42,1.8280000000000003,2.508

When our server finally came over he forced us to use the table top computer thing because they were having some kind of competition. If we had wanted to order our appetizers on that, we would have done so ourselves. Drinks took forever to get to us and we had to ask three times for extra napkins. Meanwhile a manager was literally standing 5 feet from our table our entire meal and never once asked to see if we needed anything. Drink refills were slow and he had to keep coming back to ask what we wanted. We waited 39 minutes from when we ordered to when we received our food. I upgraded to the garlic parm fries and they looked like they were yesterday's. My burger had barely any BBQ sauce on it despite ordering the whiskey river BBQ burger and it was like warm. It was very lackluster. When he brought out the kids meals he got one of the sides wrong. He then argued with me when I told him they had asked for apples and not oranges. Finally he looked at his book where he wrote it down and realized yes, in fact they had asked for apples. Probably top 10 worst service I have gotten, ever.

As far as the food goes, Red Robin has something for everyone with a specialization in Burgers.  They have TV's everywhere in the bar and no real bad item on the menu.  My kind of place and they do have Manny's on tap which I will maintain is worth a half star extra in my criteria.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-renton,2.68,2.44,2.44,2.256,2.536

12,Charles M.,"Renton, WA",0,70,162.0,1.0,2016-10-02,"Stopped for a late dinner.  Was told there was a 15 to 20 minute wait.  Hostess came out and tried to take us  to a large table. I asked if there was a booth available. Although I saw several empty ones we were told we would have to wait.  We ended up eating another 12 minutes. Finally we were taken to dining area by hostess who stopped us in front of a dirty table. The busser started to wipe the table and ended up throwing left over food onto me. Not even so much as an apology. I asked him please not to throw the food on me. He just looked at me but said nothing. We ordered our food. Wedge salad as appetizers and Royal Red Robin burger. Waited over 20 minutes for salad and it was only after the waitress walked by and had an ah ha moment....did she remember the salad. The burgers were not that great...the lettuce wilted. Asked for more fries and was given half cooked fries luke warm. Asked the waitress to bring other batch and it looked like they just added some more cooked fries on top of the undercooked ones. I asked to speak to the manager who finally came over.  I told her about our experience from the beginning. I told her I understood it was busy and a Saturday night but the service was terrible. I told her it looks like they just added a few cooked fries on top of the undercooked ones.  She said that the 1st basket had been tossed out but the kitchen staff just mixed the 1st batch of undercooked fries with the second batch under the heat lamps and then put them in a new basket for me.  If I sent them back in the 1st place why would I want undercooked fries again? My wife mentioned that the meal in general was not good and her burger tasted strange. I pointed out that the lettuce on the burgers was extremely wilted like it was bad. She blamed it on the heat lamps saying the lettuce wilts immediately under the high heat but it was more like the lettuce was old not heated. She told my wife that she would take the burger of her bill. (We asked for separate checks to take advantage of our separate rewards offers)   The manager said the waitress was in tears over the situation.....and that she is one of the more loved waitresses there. She again said it wasn't really the waitress' fault but the kitchen staff.  The waitress came back out with my fries but didn appear to have been crying. She left the bill however and my wife pointed out that the manager said she was going to deduct the burger as she didn't eat it because of it tasting badly. My wife handed her a 20 and I gave her my credit card...before I could mention my rewards (and she didn't ask if I was a member) she was off to the races.  I told her to hold up......I needed to give her my rewards number....she grabbed a pen and took down my phone number. She didn't come back but the manager did with the credit card slip and the change for my wife.  She said again she apologized and said that the waitress was in tears (again) but hoped that we would give them another chance.  I told the manager that this didn't appear to be an isolated occurrence as she had to apologize to the table next to us for having their order mixed up and delayed getting them the right one and that it looked liked she had to be apologizing to a few other tables as well. She said they were short handed amd a bit off their game tonight.  I said that judging by the comments on yelp that this has been going on for some time.  She said she had just recently came to this location but did read some of the less than favorable reviews.   Evidently nothing has been done to correct the issues.  She again apologized and told us to have a good night. My wife looked at her bill $3.27 for the wedge salad amd counted the change.  15.75.  She at first thought she had been shorted 2 cents.  I said no she gave 75 cents back and covered the 2 pennies but actually short changed a dollar on the change back. On our way out I asked the hostess to call the manager again.  The manager came up and I handed her the bill.  I said the bill was 3.27 and this is the change you gave back. She counted it and says oh you are short five dollars.  I said no...you gave back 15.75 it should have been 16 not 15 dollars back plus the change. ""Oh.....well it's just a dollar.""  Then she blamed the waitress saying that she was so flustered that she didn't make the correct change...even though it's was the manager that brought the change and credit slip to be signed. I hope that the company didn't bring this manager in to fix this location because she is way off the mark.  She didn't say she would talk to the busser about his throwing food off the table to me, kept coming up with excuses for the waitress, blamed the kitchen staff for the problems with the fries (eventhough the waitress shoikd a have double check make sure they were all cooked enough) and then throws the waitress under the bus for the incorrect change.   She did go back to get ""just a dollar"" but we left.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-renton,2.56,2.44,2.44,1.8280000000000003,2.488

Its OK, but there are limited options at The Landing and sometimes you just need a burger that's not quite as greasy as 5 Guys. The long and short of it:  1. Sandwiches. I don't say burgers because I rarely get a burger here. My personal favorite is the Whisky River BBQ Chicken sandwich, it's a nice mix of flavors and a bit lighter than a burger. They offer it as a wrap as well but usually skimp on the chicken then. They offer a large array of rotating burgers that are decent, not great. It'll do for a mid-day burger craving when it comes to it. 2. Bottomless Sides. Again, I don't just say fries because the sides are variable. Yes you can do bottomless steak fries but you can also sub this out for bottomless salad, broccoli or cold slaw for no extra cost. The Broccoli lacks in taste so I'll usually spring for the salad. Then again you're here, might as well go all in on the fries. They'll give you ranch and campfire sauce (still not entirely sure what this is but its good) upon request to dip. 3. Booze. A large selection of beers and liquor is offered but I've only been here for work lunch so I've never taken advantage of this (that you know of). A nice option to have. 4. Staff. The staff here is awesome and attentive, especially for a place located so close to a large factory that fills up quickly. They've always been exceptional at keeping glasses full, fry baskets coming and people fed. 5. Price. It's pricey for Red Robin, but that's The Landing for ya. A burger and fries will run you over $10 alone. Tack on a drink or appetizer and you're looking at a bill that I wouldn't want to pay for OK food.  6. Payment. You can split bills by item and pay via table consoles which is neat and speeds things up a bit. Much appreciated for people who need to get back to work. I'm not crazy about Red Robin, but it is what it is and every once in awhile you just have to grab a burger and entirely too many fries. Just try to not get dragged in by the smell too much!

Then she tried to direct us to the bar- I politely said no thanks and we wanted to sit in the main part of the restaurant. I received attitude. They are so lazy!! Now the food- ordered a whiskey river bbq burger which came out fairly quickly BUT speed does not equal quality at all! The bun was stale, the onion straws were a soggy oily mess. The fries were old!

When they did bring the correct items, 2 of the orders were incorrect.  The appetizer that was ordered was the LAST item brought to the table.   The queso dip had a LARGE chunk of hamburger patty in it.   Most everything about this experience was bad and that was twice in a row.   We will never eat at this Red Robin again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-renton,2.32,2.41,2.41,2.02,2.374

The quality of food and menu has definitely changed with some things getting worse - like the garlic fries, and some things improving like the variety of burgers offered. I was disappointed that the milkshakes don't come with the leftovers in the metal cups anymore and they give you the exact amount. Our service has always been attentive and quick. The wait can be long during peak times but the nice thing is they'll take your cell number and you can shop around the Landing until your table is ready.

The Landing has a few restaurants and we've been to most of them.  The standout stuff here (for me) are not the burgers, but I've had some servers here that are so slow it's taken 30 minutes for food to come out...and I've also had my order wrong. If I were less lazy and tired, I'd haul my butt down the other Red Robin out in Tukwila, but sometimes I really want something close to home that isn't fast food. I love Red Robin's shakes and malts. No whip, no cherry...chocolate or vanilla shake or chocolate or vanilla malts with EXTRAAAAAAAA MAAAALLLT!!!! There's a reason why we're not here every week day or week...and it's the shakes/malts. The long and short of it is I've found this RR, in general, to be one of the worst out of all the RRs I've been to (the first is the one at Rivermark in San Jose, CA, with a manager who called me and seemed so disinterested in what I had to say about poor service I received)...and as a total heifer who has eaten at all the RRs in CA, WA and OR (ok, totally ashamed to admit that, but I need to establish my credibility when I make statements like the one in the sentence before!), I don't like saying that because I'm a total RR fan since the early 90s. Great, now I'm showing my friggin age. Anyway, we come here because it's one of the few sit down restaurants that's open late near us.

The girl that rang me up to help her was not I ordered a bonsai salad that had really good chicken on it but the dressing was so mustardy that I could only have a few bites before I gave up. I should have tasted the dressing before I poured it on. The menu does not specify that the salad has a honey mustard type dressing instead of an Asian dressing which would make more sense. Again, I should have asked. They also didn't give me the garlic toast that was supposed to come with it.  My boyfriend got chicken tenders with a total of six fries with them, all of which were ice cold. The amount you pay for the amount of food you get with this is not good.  My friend got the pub mac n cheese which had no flavor to it at all and the serving size was like a side instead of a full order.

Then I go up to the hostess and ask about 2go orders, and she points me at the red counter just to my right. I stand there, and shes still standing there at her podium, and does not assist me. In fact, no one assisted me for about 5 whole minutes. Waitresses and bussers walking by, the hostess still looking bored at her podium, and what appears to be a Manager overseeing it all, not jumping in to help. Awesome manager skillz. Finally some guy comes up, hes friendly and he gets my order info but then a call comes in. He ends up taking this phone call for about 4+ minutes, while NO ONE comes in to go get the food. Again, manager is just standing there at the front of the house, girl at the podium still standing there, but nope, everyone's too busy to fetch the food. Finally the call ends and he moseys to the back and comes back with my order.  I walk out back to my car where the uber driver is still there waiting for me to return.
