Pure deliciousness! Always clean, always friendly and always expensive, unfortunately. Be prepared to spend at least $30 for two people. Pretty lame but hey, at least you got bottomless fries!

59,Casey C.,"Richmond, VA",149,155,86.0,5.0,2012-07-23,"Red Robin is classic.  It's very rare that I don't get something delicious here.  They are known for the burgers, with most types found on both beef and chicken.  I love the Teriyaki Chicken Burger, with a fat grilled pineapple and teriyaki sauce, or the Whiskey River BBQ Burger, sweet and crunchy topped with BBQ sauce and onion straws. The other day I wasn't very hungry so I ordered a side of the Mac & Cheese (""adult version,"" meaning cavatappi noodles) with a side of steamed broccoli and mixed them together.  So yummy! So cheap! $1.99 + $1.29 and I had enough left over for a future lunch. The broccoli was a little on the dry side but the Mac & cheese more than made up for it.  With gooey stringy cheese on top and creamy cheese underneath, it was so worth the $2. Their fries are delicious, their milkshakes are decadent, and pretty much everything on the menu is pretty damn tasty.  Service is usually splendid, and my only gripe is how noisy it gets whenever there's a large group in the middle of the restaurant.  Not really a bad thing for them.  Are you on your way yet?

Red Robin has a good combination of ingredients for their burgers. The burgers come out hot and they are tasty. I try different burgers on the menu. All the burgers I've tried were tasty. My favorite burger is the BBQ burger. The burgers at Red Robin come with bottomless steak fries. I usually add garlic and parmesan cheese to my fries, so delicious! Red Robin has some good dipping sauces for their fries. The smoked bacon aioli and Thai chili sauces are very flavorful. Red Robin has some good milkshakes. Theres a bar in Red Robin, the drinks are hit or miss depending on the bartender. The service is usually average. The employees are friendly. Red Robin has a nice family atmosphere.

The spicy chipotle sauce is a stand out but what makes this burger really good is juicyness. Other turkey burgers I have had are dry, tough and tastless. Not here though. When I went to this place for the very first time I tried the turkey burger and I do not think I have ever had one of their beef burgers...they are that good! Mainly a family joint but they do have a small bar if you are by yourself and at least you can get a Sam Adams at this place with your burger.

68,Joe N.,"Wantagh, NY",0,32,,2.0,2013-08-16,The food was eh. The waiter and kitchen staff were a nightmare. They rushed everything out without the trimmings. We ordered pretzel appetizers but they had no beer/mustard sauce left. We ordered salads and no dressings came. Fish and chips with no cole slaw and tartar sauce. A beer was ordered and that never came. A burger was ordered and it was raw and had to be sent back. The waiter was very inexperienced and we felt sorry for him but that's not my problem. I would not go back to this Red Robin. The one near Dorney Park is awesome. The food and service were grea,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-richmond-2?start=60,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006
51,A.M. D.,"Richmond, VA",2,75,18.0,2.0,2013-11-19,"I first experienced the Red Robin chain back in 1981... in Boise, Idaho. The chain was still relatively small back then... maybe a 100 locations ...and it was a bit different than it is now. Still upscale casual, but the focus was more on adults, rather than families with young children. And the menu was more upscale with fewer ""home style"" items. They even had a ""flaming mai tai"", which we always ordered. Now, with about 500 locations nationally (most of them franchised?), the chain seems to have turned into a grease pit... sort of an upscale Chucky Cheese. I went to one in the Atlanta suburbs earlier this year, and was quite turned off by both the (loud) child-birthday-party ambiance, inattentive service, and bland fare. I also had a similar impression of the Chesterfield Towne Center location a couple years ago. I went to Red Robin's Short Pump location on Sunday night with a few friends (one of them had selected it). When we arrived at 6 p.m., the restaurant was only about 2/3rds full, yet we had to wait 5 mins to be seated. We requested the bar area to get away from the notable kiddie noise we heard coming from the general seating area. I was pleased to see football games on the several overhead TVs. Our waiter was friendly, but wasn't able to answer some of our questions about drink prices and such. Not being a beer drinker (any longer), I get a little frustrated when wait staff know the prices of every beer option, but turn blank when asked the cost of a basic, ""vodka tonic"". I also get annoyed when they openly quote the price of every beer special, but offer no price info on liquor specials. In spite of the restaurant not being very crowded, our waiter wasn't winning any speed records for service. Our drinks (a beer, cocktail and 3 soft drinks) took over 5 mins to arrive ...a little odd, since we were seated in the half-empty bar section. And the food took about 20 mins to arrive. During that time, our waiter only stopped by once, and didn't apologize for the wait or even mention our food. When the food finally arrived, the ""crispy chicken sandwich"" I ordered was greasy and flavorless. The steak fries were skimpy in portion and room temperature. For $10, I couldn't help but to think how much more I would have enjoyed Chick-fil-A, and paid much less. Even though I was hungry, the sandwich was so greasy and flavorless, I only ate half of it. Others in our group ordered the hamburgers, which they seemed to enjoy for the most part, and one friend ordered the ""Prime Rib Dip"", which I think he enjoyed. Bottom Line...  These days, Red Robin seems best suited for folks who like big greasy burgers and related comfort foods, and don't mind spending a premium for them. If your palate is more discerning -- or if you are looking for a quiet and/or romantic venue -- you will likely be disappointed with Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-richmond-2?start=40,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006
30,Damian L.,"Henrico, VA",160,237,1918.0,4.0,2013-12-15,"Yeah, it's a chain, yeah, it's nothing new or revolutionary.  But what Red Robin does have are delicious burgers, and I'm a fan. --Food: I had a Bacon Cheeseburger with Cheddar and Onion Straws.  The onion straws were prominent enough to provide a nice onion flavor (sometimes onion straws get lost in the burger), and the bacon was tasty.  My fiancee had the Clucks and Shrimp plate, which has Chicken Tenders, Shrimp, and endless fries.  She said that the tenders were really good but the shrimp a bit salty, but still good.  We both enjoyed the fries, and the Red Robin seasoning is basically crack.  Like other Red Robins, the fries are endless, so eat to your heart's content (or perhaps your stomach's). --Cost: Our bill came to about $30 I think.  I suppose I wish it were a little cheaper, since you can get organic or bison burgers at locally owned Burgerworks for about the same price.  However, I always enjoy Red Robin, so I can't really knock it too much, and it's not grossly overpriced I suppose. --Atmosphere: We went around noon on a Sunday.  There were a decent amount of people there and even more after church got out around 12:30.  The dining area is pretty large, although some of the tables are oddly close to others, and others not.  The decor is pretty standard and resembled the Red Robin I have been to in upstate NY. --Service: In the past, I've had some waiting problems with Red Robin, but this location didn't seem to have this problem.  Perhaps they have more staff on Sunday, or perhaps we got lucky, but our service was fast. --Overall: I love Red Robin.  You might be able to get a more artisan gourmet burger at one of the local burger places, but Red Robin consistently provides a meal I enjoy.  Red Robin, yum!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-richmond-2?start=20,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003

I took a party of 9 there a few days ago.  The food- appetizers were okay but were small. I ordered chips and guac but it only came with enough chips for  one person.. I couldn't figure out why they would do that for an appetizer knowing that they are normally shared?? We also had wings, and onion rings, they were pretty good and tasty.  Entrees-  most of the table ordered bacon burgers with various toppings. The burger was good.. Tasty.. But the bottomless fries were awful.. Besides being cold, they were tasteless like no one bothered to throw a dash of salt on them.  The same thing went for the bottomless freckled lemonades.. Lame... They weren't anything like the picture -  I ordered an alcoholic version of the freckled lemonade and it was horrible too. I asked him to take it back, he was shocked I didn't like it and insisted I try another one thinking it might be a bad batch I guess,. However, the 2nd one was the same so I didn't drink either one.

I like coming here because I like their campfire sauce! awe yea!  This Red Robin looks almost identical to most Red Robins. (If you've ever been to you.)  But before you go, I want to talk about the end-less fries. Other RRs I've been to, serves a nice size of fries when you get your burger. And any additional order of fries, is pretty equivalent to the first batch. I typically get two servings. 1 with my burger, and 1 additional. Not here. This place, for some reason, is very very skimpy with their fries. My skinny fiance who doesn't eat much, also had to request a second order of fries. And the fries seems to take a long time to come out. I mean, just throw down a bunch of fries and have them ready to go! You are serving end-less fries so to try to make them to order, is nonsense.

48,Michael R.,"Doswell, VA",4,87,1.0,3.0,2014-09-05,"I think three stars is appropriate for a place like this.  I was dining here recently on the recommendation of a friend, who admittedly hadn't eaten at this location, but was familiar with what the chain had to offer.  This restaurant, located on the outskirts of the Short Pump mall, is in a busy location, as we had lots of traffic parading through the restaurant during our lunch hour.  When the place is fully packed, the combination of people and music can get loud at times, so keep that in mind if you're looking for a more quiet place to eat. The party I was with all opted for different styles of burgers for our lunch.  Let me say this about Red Robin, one of their selling points is that they have quite a variety of burgers and toppings for all tastes, however I would consider them a jack-of-all-burgers, and master of none.  All of the burgers that we got were good in their own right, but none of them were super overwhelming.  I had their Bleu Ribbon, with blue cheese, and felt that the bun was just a bit too large/too much bread for the size of the meat, and all of us felt that the chef that day had a heavy hand with the sauces.  Also, as others have noted, bottomless fries only really works if they are both plentiful, and at your table.  We were provided small servings with our meals, and then had to ask several times for some additional fries.  To his credit, our server clued in about the second or third time and brought triple baskets around, which were hot out of the fryer and definitely one of the high points of the meal, but come on, if it's something you advertise, it should be that way all the time. For just a good 'ol cheeseburger, their prices are a bit steep, however when you consider the variety you're provided access to, and the ""bottomless"" fries (if you wait around long enough), it's not that terrible.  Probably better for a group with a wide variety of tastes/desires, but a decent place if you're in the area and in the mood for a burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-richmond-2?start=40,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004,2.9240000000000004

I was so happy to find they had an app, so I used their meal builder, I'm dieting so this was awesome to find out a burger place did have options for me. But this is where the excitement ended.  We visited this red robins at 11:30 today. A Sunday. It was not busy. At all. Maybe three families at most, and one guy at the bar. The whole time we were there. Shelby was our waitress, she spent all of her time talking to the man at the bar. She brought our food, then we never saw her again until we were done. She never asked if we wanted dessert. Never asked about refills on drinks, and my husband only got the small amount of fries that came with his burger. He was never offered more fries, so he never even got their ""claim to fame"" endless fries everybody raves about. We even looked online to be for sure his meal indeed came with endless fries. It did. The food we had was wonderful. Service stunk and therefore we will never be back to this location. I will add : I had the ensanada chicken plater - with one chicken breast. It was very good. I'm dieting so this was 230 calories and it was really good and it came with a southwest type ranch included in the calories. It was very good. Hubby got the burger with egg on it. He thought it was awesome too. Too bad the service is so bad. The food was good and he was disappointed he missed out on the endless fries and would have enjoyed a refilled drink every now and then.

Unfortunately now that I have, it will be my last visit. Overall experience The food was flavorless. My burger does not taste juicey and I think the patty may have sat there for awhile. Food We got the big nacho crunch tavern and love bite. The crunch tavern does have a crunch to it, but that's it. It tastes bland. I expected the love bite to have a kick to it, but there was nothing. The first batch of fries with the burger was good and warm. But the 2nd order was soft and cool. The food itself is not worth the price. Service Our waitress was pleasant at the beginning came back twice to take our order. She stopped by shortly after giving us our food to check up on us. Unfortunately a fry was out and it took us a while before we capture her attention for more. Worth 10% tip. She was doing her job, nothing more. Settings It was quiet when we went with just a few table seated. The lighting is bright making it a good place for large group. Not quite for romantic event.

It's rare that you find poutine made with cheese curds (which is how ""real"" poutine is supposed to be!) instead of just melted cheese, but Red Robin delivered. I wanted to drink the gravy if that tells you anything.  The boyfriend ordered one of their new burgers that had beer cheese on it, I wish I could remember the name...but it was on their promotional menu and it's only here for a limited time. I ordered their Bleu burger, and it was just ok. The aioli on top left a lot to be desired and the whole burger was just...soggy. I'm gonna stick with my crispy chicken sandwich or the whiskey river chicken wrap from now on.  I also just have to say, the service was excellent. Our waiter was super funny and took great care of our table. They have this new table-side tablet ordering system which is pretty neat -- you can order apps or additional drinks/refills from it and it signals the waiter, so you're never kept waiting for anything. It's a neat idea, but honestly it didn't do much for the overall experience, I prefer the table-touching.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-richmond-2?start=20,3.32,3.32,3.32,2.8000000000000003,3.3200000000000003

25,Merrill G.,"Henrico, VA",62,8,16.0,2.0,2016-04-09,"Wow, that was a disappointing meal.  First the good things though.  Most of the meal was typical for our experiences at Red Robin. The kids had a nice variety of items to choose from, they were nice potions and there were plenty of healthy options for their sides. My burger was perfectly ok but the sweet potato fries were only warm. Our server was friendly, knowledgeable, attentive and quick with refills. And we were seated quickly for a Saturday night. Now the disappointing part. First of all, my wife was hoping for a proper meal, not a sandwich. This is clearly not the place to get that. The entree page of the menu indicates that those items are not served on buns (makes sense as they are entrees after all). The French dip mentioned nothing about a bun. Other items throughout the menu mention their bun type but not this item in the entree section. So even though the French dip is typically served on a bun we concluded it must be their take on the traditional item. Wrong. It was just another French dip sandwich. It tasted ok but it should not be called or priced as an entree. Now the gross part. One of us got the sundae. It was messy looking but tasted fine. But they found something in it that was not ice cream! It was white and CHEWEY!!! Our attentive waiter apologized and took the offending dish to the manager. The manager returned quickly and explained dismissively that it was chicken. They prepare chicken beside the area where they prepared the sundae and a piece had fallen in. She politely offered to get us another dessert. Really? Who would want to eat anything after such a gross experience? I'm sorry, but if a patron finds weird stuff in their meal, management should fall over themselves to make it right. It's not ok that the stuff happened to be edible. This is not like finding a french fry in an order of onion rings. This was MEAT in a SUNDAE! I did not wish to be confrontational so I left it at that and paid my full bill. I know that a negative review is far more constructive.  I am still giving them two stars for an average meal served by attentive staff. So if you enjoy meat in your desserts give them a try!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-richmond-2?start=20,3.08,3.08,3.08,2.7600000000000007,3.0800000000000005

I get that Red Robin is not some fancy dining place. At the same time though their customer service should not be below the average customer service level. My server Kayla L for one barely made eye contact and when giving her my order she quickly snatched the menu out of my hand so hard I could feel it almost scrap my palm. When I asked if I could have a box she said nothing to me and just walked away so I started to pay on the little tablet thing they have sitting on the table assuming I was not getting a box. As she quickly walked by still no eye contact and quickly said I will get you a box. Now I'm a strong believer in that if you barely meet the average customer service I will not be living you a tip. I do not reward horrible customer service. Long story short I will never return to this location if this is how they train their employees. I'm also assuming  that she was able to see that I didn't tip her from their main server screen so she came over enacted the tablet off the table didn't even tell us to have a good day no eye contact and walked off.

We also understand that our waitress had multiple tables to tend. When we were seated, it took our waitress nearly 15-20 minutes to even acknowledge us. And that was after we paged for her, not once, but twice. We waited 40 minutes until our food arrived at the table and at least 3/7 orders were wrong or missing ingredients/sides. We also ordered bottomless fries and only received 5-6 on our plates. My burger was completely burnt on one side, but I was so hungry at that point, I didn't ask for another.  One of the managers (I'm assuming) and a few other waitresses came out to bring us more fries and fix the orders. We really appreciated that! But we did not have our drinks refilled the entire time and when we asked for the check to be split, the waitress replied rudely with, ""You mean you want me to split EACH and EVERY one of your bills?""  I understand the struggle must have been real that night or that she may have been new, but that was some of the worst service I've ever received.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-richmond-2,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006
12,Austin R.,"Moyock, NC",0,15,4.0,1.0,2017-07-24,The bar tender Danelle was nice she she was prompt getting my drink order and giving me my menu even with the guy interrupting her every time she went to do something. The food was less than fair I ordered the bacon cheeseburger medium I got it medium but full of grease. Needless to say I didn't finish it because I didn't want to clog a artery and the fries they gave I seriously had 12 fries I seriously counted them because I remember when you got a bunch with your meal and by the time you get more your like screw it give me my bill I'm over it. It's honestly terrible how far Red Robin has fallen I will never be back this was the last time try for the third time and I'm officially done they will not see me or my money ever again!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-richmond-2,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006
22,Bryan S.,"Richmond, VA",0,4,,1.0,2017-08-14,"Was here on Thursday August 10th, and the waitress took it upon herself to add $6 to my credit card the next day after I clearly wrote the word cash on the tip line.  Cash was left on the table for her, but she decided she needed more on a $20 tab.  Food took forever, I'll never return.  Appalled that an employee at this establishment would commit fraud, and alter a credit card receipt.  Luckily I check my statements, and disputed the charge with my credit card company.  My money has already been refunded.  Integrity is worth $6 to the woman who served me that day.  Sketchy is the best way I can describe this Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-richmond-2?start=20,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96
7,Tiana J.,"Chesapeake, VA",49,1,,1.0,2017-09-30,On a family trip we stopped in for the first time for a late night bite then hit the road home. We walked in asked for seating of nine and was greeted by a very rude hostess. The other one was nice and polite but  we did not want to be separated in seated (tried to work with her despite her interrupting my brothers questions with a obvious attitude) he asked if table could be pushed together (he worked for red robins about 10 yrs ago for 3yrs) after he asked that she stormed away and said thats what we do now.  Then he ask for a manager. POOR UNQUALIFIED MANAGER AT THAT. we were telling him what were experiencing and she storms back up rudely explains her side admitted to having an attitude and instead of him diffusing the situation he try's to put blame on him.  My mother who is a hr/cust service manager then explain to the manager his wrongdoing politely and how he could fix a situation like this in the future. As this is going on the hostess or waitress is still saying rude remarks and looking unbothered. She should be FIRED. and the manager needs more training. You may not have to reprimand your employees in front of customers but you definitely shouldn't blame and employees attitude on customers who didn't address her rudely. Needless to say we took our business elsewhere.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-richmond-2,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8
5,Florina S.,"Virginia Beach, VA",200,75,23.0,5.0,2017-10-01,"If you're feeling bottomless fries, you've come To the right place. When I came here on a Saturday it was packed so if you're not into big crowds I'd suggest coming here on a weekday. But even on a Saturday their service was pretty quick. I ordered the basic burger with bottomless sweet potato fries. I highly suggest their bottomless sweet potato fries if you're into sweet potatoes. It's well worth the extra cents. Also I suggest getting their sauces, it made the meal that much better. Also their seasoning that sits on the table is absolutely addicting and I want to get a hold of one if I can. My sisters and I went to the shortpump location and it was a really great experience. I went to another Red Robin's farther away and had the same amazing experience. I also highly suggest getting their onion rings. It's massive and hot and crunchy. The sauce that comes with it is amazing with everything. Definitely going to come back here again",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-richmond-2,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8

Last time I went it took about 25 min for my burger and the place was a ghost town. The burger was good tho, but the fries were cold, and the server was great he got was fresh hot fries right away and kept the drinking coming.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-richmond-2,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88
2,Rich G.,"Glen Allen, VA",5,226,5.0,3.0,2017-12-03,"The thing that let's this Red Robin down the most is the incredibly slow service. I've taken my family here four or five times and the service is always slow. So it's not a problem with just one server. The burgers are good. Price is reasonable. They have endless fries which I'm sure some people love. We skip that, but appreciate the offer. We love the art on the walls. Cool ambiance. Noise level is high, though. I love that we can pay for the check at an on-table ziosk.  If service came at a normal clip, we'd come more often and bump the review up to 4 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-richmond-2,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88
0,Mary-Margaret H.,"Richmond, VA",63,28,27.0,5.0,2017-12-21,"I haven't been to Red Robin in years, and I was pleasantly surprised by their extensive new menu and technology upgrades! They've now updated to the iPad ordering system which I love, although service tends to lack in restaurants with these systems. We were able to quickly order an appetizer after placing our burger orders, and we could call on our waitress too! The burgers here were so good! I rarely finish my entire meal, and even though I was stuffed halfway through, I couldn't stop until I was finished. Not only do they have bottomless fries, but they have bottomless beverages (including the specialty lemonades and what not) and a few other bottomless sides. Get the freckled lemonade!! And call your server over before it empties. Trust me. You're gonna want 15 of these drinks. We had a great lunch altogether! Perfect for a quick bite.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-richmond-2,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005

I never saw the sour cream. Very scant on the accoutrements.  3) I was over charged for a ""SD Burger Patty"" @ $2.59 & a ""Simple Burger"" @ $8.99. Total Overcharge $11.58 The staff was great, sang Happy Birthday W/Sundae. The Fries are great, But being overcharged $11.58 leaves a bitter taste & no reason to go back to Red Robin. Yes, I should have looked closer at the Payment Receipt before I paid, so that's on me.  Word to the wise, When an establishment adds the word ""Gourmet"" in front of a food item, expect to pay 200% more than normal, Saying so doesn't make it so...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-richmond-2,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005
