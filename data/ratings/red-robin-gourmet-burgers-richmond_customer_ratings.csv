46,Eric C.,"Richmond, VA",35,64,29.0,4.0,2012-03-22,"I've seen this place around for many years and no one ever talks about this place. I hear more about the commericals than the food. I ate here yesterday for lunch because I wanted a nasty burger. I ordered a cheeseburger and I have to say that it's not bad at all. They added relish to my burger and kind of threw the taste of the burger away. I don't think I'm going to have relish on my burgers anymore. The waitress hooked me up some extra fries to go, so that was boss.

55,David L.,"Santa Clara, CA",4,18,14.0,2.0,2012-04-14,"Tonight we ordered the Southwest Chicken Salad and the Burning Love burger and both were delicious!  There's only one problem, I saw something that I wish I hadn't.  When I had to use the restroom in the middle of our meal I saw through the cracks of the stall that there was a person wearing the exact same orange-red shirt with dark gray black pants on; now while I was doing #1, he was finishing up #2.  The problem is not that I had to use that stall, it was the fact that when he was done, he had passed me and then the sink and exited the restroom.  Now, to be fair I can't say I saw a face; however given that the colors were the exact same as the other workers I'd say the probability that it was an employee is extremely high.  Luckily our food was served before he had to go to the restroom, so there was no risk of any tidbits from his wiping that would've ended up in our food. As for the later customers, well sucks for them.

I hadn't used it yet and my new beau was in town, visiting from Georgia and had never been to RR. He's a burger lover, so I told him we should check it out. On the way, we got into a car accident and were delayed quite a bit while we sorted all that out. I said we should skip RR, but he thought it'd be a good idea to drive over and just decompress from the craziness. We made our way over and I felt kind of bad because it was close to closing time. However, the wait staff took us with a smile and waited on us. They even made him a milkshake without an eye roll or a sigh. We got our burgers and they were both tasty. The waitress came back to check on us and gave us refills without complaint and we never felt rushed. She took the more expensive burger off the bill (really, less than a dollar difference, but it was a nice gesture) and I left her a good tip for putting us with us (I really feel terrible when I go in late to a restaurant, I know they want to go home ASAP).

If you want it to go you can call ahead or go in and order from the bar. When we placed our order it was a about a 10 min wait, which wasn't too bad for us since he works across the street. I got the soup and sandwich combo and same with my bf. However I got the BTLA with chowder and he got the whiskey river BBQ chicken wrap and chili. My sandwich was really good. The croissant was buttery, flakey and with the avocado turkey and bacon it was just delish. However I do wish my bacon was a little but more crispy cause it was just super flat looking, but still tasted good cause I mean come on it's bacon. Now my soup was a different story. Good, yes, but it had to be the strangest clam chowder I've ever had. I'm going in thinking I'm gonna get potatoes and celery. But all I got was clams. Literally just clams. I mean it was good but that's not clam chowder if you ask me. My bf really loved their chili though. He said it was just like a home style chili.

Another person delivered the food to the table, and when we were missing some things we had to ask another server.

8,Chris L.,"Midlothian, VA",67,459,18.0,2.0,2017-02-18,They really need some kind of call ahead seating for their location.  I actually called to ask if they had a wait.  The lady said no (I was a little concerned because she didn't ask many any other questions and seemed kind of clueless as to the question). We were in the mall parking lot so walked in 4 minutes later and there is 15 minute wait they say now.  Either train your people to answer the phone properly or get a real system for people to come to your restaurant without having to wait.  We had to leave and go to another restaurant as the reason I called to ask was we didn't have time to wait.  Very disappointed in this locations policies toward customers (and we walk out of here more than not because of he wait).  I will continue to infrequent this location although I do like the Red Robin chain.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-richmond,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76

24,Kaitlyn H.,"Powhatan, VA",65,25,,1.0,2017-03-05,"If you are looking for a decent burger look harder. The kitchen here is most likely lacking some formal education as it appears they cannot read basic instructions. Hopefully you aren't picky nor need special accommodations for your order, if so it will be completely disregarded and you will get just what the menu says. Also don't bother complaining as it will most likely take just as long for them to fix your order as it did for the initial item to come out, in this instance 30-45 min for two burgers. On another note make sure not to dress up as you will surely be using your garments as napkins.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-richmond?start=20,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6

One of the nice things is they offer bottomless steak fries with a burger, which is a nice perk at any restaurant, but especially here where the steak fries are great.  Another nice thing is there campfire sauce which is great for dipping your fries or onion rings, which are also excellent.  Our table was a group of 5 and every one loved what they got.

0,Stephanie K.,"Richmond, VA",177,98,104.0,4.0,2017-12-29,"Red Robin has always been a solid choice for me when it comes to feeding my burger crave. Prices aren't what I'd call cheap, service times largely depends on what day and time you come, but I think the quality of the foods makes up for it in the end. Red Robin has a large selection of burgers that you wouldn't get elsewhere. Their burgers are presented clean and neat. Not trash like a fast food restaurant, and not messy like a hipster ""hole in the wall"" burger joint. My choice of burger each time is the Fiery Ghost Style Tavern Double Burger. It always tastes great and coupled with bottomless fries, makes a pretty good choice. I rarely go past 2 buckets of fries. I'd say the fries are okay. They come out hot and cooked, but they seem to lack some flavor and crunchiness compared to what fries are known for.  Service for the most part, has been quite busy for me. It's usually they're really packed and so the waiters/waitresses are frantically trying to serve them all and find seating for me and my group. I can't fault them for that as they're just doing their job and business is busy, but just a fair heads up. There are times and days where it's slower, so try to go on those times/days (usually non-typical eating out days/times). Some locations will have a self check out with a tablet too, which is super convenient and cool. Overall, if you want a step above fast food, but not crazy expensive hipster burger joint, Red Robin is a great choice in my eyes. I know some people don't come here because of pricing or busy place, well, what do you expect? This is what happens when you come to a popular place! It's definitely a nice place to eat out for celebrations or once in a while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-richmond,3.08,3.08,3.08,,3.0800000000000005
1,Patrick G.,"Richmond, VA",27,32,5.0,2.0,2018-01-08,"My wife and I stopped here with some friends of ours for dinner. We waited 13 minutes to be seated, even though there were plenty of empty seats. When we did get seated, our server entertained us with how his week went, how boring it had been and how happy that he was excited to see us. I wouldn't have mind if it was a minute or two, but he went on for approximately 15 minutes before taking our order, he went on so long that it gave everyone at the table to figure out what they wanted to eat and drink. My wife ordered the fish and chip platter, I ordered the turkey burger with the tower of onion rings. Our friends ordered a chicken salad with fries and the burger and bottomless fries. When we received our drinks, I had to sit through another session concerning my unsweetened ice tea and how others are confused by the listed tea orders. When our food arrived, my order came with a regular order of onion rings. After a few minutes, I saw another server and informed him that I was supposed to receive the tower of onion rings but I received a side order. When my original server came back, he did apologize in a very rambling way and told me that my onion rings would be forthcoming. After 30 more minutes, we were finished and ready for the check. My burger was extremely flat and was with out the tomatoes and cheese that was suppose to be on it. My wife's order was dry or over cooked. Our friends orders were alright. Overall, we could have eaten and been out if our server would have cut down on the conversation about himself and focused more on customer service. I learned never to trust someone that does not write your orders down. My food order would have been right if he would have done so! Go if you have plenty of time on your hands!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-richmond,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004
