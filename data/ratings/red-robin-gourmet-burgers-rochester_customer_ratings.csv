We were seated and ordered right away. I ordered my favorite, the bonzai burger and half of the burger was missing. The only thing on the burger was lettuce and mayo. The fries looked really burnt. The waitress and the manager brought me a new burger. Mistakes happen, didn't ruin my night and appreciated the manager talking to me about it without me asking for her to. The one thing I didn't like though, was we had to wait a really long time for the waitress to take our check to pay. She was cleaning up and seemed more interested in leaving to go home than to allow us to pay and leave.

60,Chris T.,"Rochester, NY",32,79,4.0,1.0,2014-01-07,"Well, that was a horrible experience. My wife and I were headed to the movies last week and decided to grab a burger at Red Robin before our show. Neither of us had ever been there before, but we were expecting a Five Guys or Shake Shack type of experience (more upscale fast food place). We were surprised to find out this was an actual sit down restaurant with an insane menu that seemed to rival The Cheesecake Factory in length and random offerings. But that wasn't the issue.  It was a Thursday night and not terribly crowded, but we were seated in a corner by the kitchen door and waited almost 10 minutes for our waitress to come greet us. We both picked out burgers that sounded good and had been made to look mouthwatering by those food photographers who created the menu. We both eat our burgers medium rare and when mine arrived, it was still cold in the center. Once that was fixed, we both noticed that our burgers tasted like they had been doused in liquid smoke to give some grill flavor and clearly had been branded with grill lines (I mean, I don't expect them to cook on an ACTUAL grill, but don't patronize me with grill lines...). For a place that proclaims itself as a home for ""Gourmet Burgers"", these were major issues. The burgers and toppings on them were extremely salty as well and beyond everything I already mentioned, made them essentially inedible. The fries were crispy and apparently unlimited, but that was no where near enough to make this place worth it.  Reeeed Robinnn...

28,Breanna B.,"Rochester, NY",1766,907,6157.0,4.0,2014-01-13,"You can't love the good food without indulging in the bad. Sometimes a greasy burger is all you need to conquer a busy Saturday afternoon. When we arrived a party of 17 was seated in the dining room so we opted for a more casual bar dining experience. There was an open table and we were greeted promptly by our server who brought us the two pints of beer we ordered (Sam Adams Boston Lager & Winter Lager).  While the menu is quite large and packed with countless options, it's hard to stray from the standard options. Although, one time I did try the southwest grilled chicken salad -- the fried jalapeños were probably the highlight. Anyway, that day my bf and I ordered the chicken sandwich and the patty melt to share.  ""Some pink or no pink"" is their attempt at differentiating themselves from the fully cooked fast food patty. I go for some pink and would qualify their burgers as juicy because they're greasy and topped with some extras like a dressing or mayo. I really enjoyed both the dishes we had. I was looking for salty, hearty food and I got it. The patty melt burger was on warm, buttered marble rye, topped with swiss, 1000 Island Dressing, and caramelized onions. The chicken sandwich has bit of a southern chicken sandwich flare with the seasoned batter and the pickles that top the sandwich. Not for the everyday meal, but a solid option for lunch after a night of drinking or when you have to bear a day of shopping around Jefferson Rd.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rochester?start=20,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003
49,Pradip A.,"Corn Hill, Rochester, NY",39,61,26.0,4.0,2014-03-09,"Reasonably priced burgers, plenty of options, and unlimited steak fries, what's not to like?  On those days where you want something better than a 5 Guys burger, but you don't feel like going to a higher end burger joint like Gate House, Red Robin delivers.  You're not going to come out of the restaurant feeling blown away, but you'll most likely be satisfied.  I've had most of the burgers on their menu, as well as some of their specialty/limited-offer burgers, and they've all been pretty good.  My personal favorite is the Burnin' Love Burger. They offer the choice of ""some pink or no pink"".  Like any self-respecting person, I always go with some pink, but even if they were to cook it well done, there's usually enough grease to keep it juicy.  The only time I've complained about the saltiness is when I've substituted the turkey burger for the beef; I stopped that practice shortly after realizing the seasoning they use on the turkey burgers is the equivalent of drinking sea water.  The great thing about Red Robin is their unlimited steak fries and bottomless drinks.  I recommend going for the garlic parmesan fries to add a little more flavor to them, and while you're at it, order some campfire sauce.  You'll thank me later.   Most places have bottomless beverages, but bottomless root beer floats is a whole other thing!  On a hot summer day, stop in at lunch time and just indulge for a few. While Red Robin is a sit down restaurant, my favorite place to eat is right at the bar.  Whether I go by myself or with some friends, I have always received great service at the bar and what goes better with a big, juicy burger than a cold beer?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rochester?start=40,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004,2.8960000000000004
41,Arvid Y.,"Rochester, NY",278,446,629.0,4.0,2014-03-09,"One of my favorite chain burger restaurants in town. The reasonable prices, variety of burgers and bottomless fries keep bringing me back. A good burger and tall beer serve as the perfect reward after a long day of work.  Like another reviewer mentioned, Red Robin is a good compromise between a fast food burger (ie. 5 guys) and a gourmet burger (ie. Good Luck). It won't break the bank and you're almost guaranteed to be full afterwards. At the same time, Red Robin offers a casual but comfortable dining atmosphere.  At this Henrietta location, I've found the service to be consistently good. There are plenty of tables, so you seldom have to wait even at peak hours. Unlike some other trendier restaurants serving gourmet burgers, the noise level is acceptable. Parking is plentiful and easy too.  The burgers are cooked to order. With 10+ different types of burgers, it's hard to choose just one. My go-to burgers are the Royal Red Robin (Fried Egg and Bacon), Whiskey River (BBQ sauce and crispy onion straws) and the Banzai (Teriyaki sauce and grilled pineapple).

67,Katie M.,"Buffalo, NY",0,26,,3.0,2014-03-29,"I've been to this red robin many times. This last time (today for lunch) warranted a review, because it was such a strange experience. I dont think it has anything to do with the actual restaurant, but new changes that i assume were brought on by corporate policy change. First thing is, the menu change. More burgers added, but they are astronomically priced. Wanted to try one of them but for $15, I'm not biting. So I order my tride and true affordable bleu ribbon burger.  It came out on a plate (GASP!), unwrapped (OH NO!) and with about 5 single fries accompanying it (WTF?!) So i gobble the burger and fries and after about 5 minutes my fries are all gone. So I order some more (thank god they're bottomless!) Well, that was disappointing. Usually what happens is, I eat some fries, order some more, and take the rest home for my poor grad student dinner (or next day's lunch). This time, though, I received a basket of no more than 10 single fries. My whole table of 5 stared at the basket, confused. THIS was bottomless? I suppose I could have asked for even more fries, but I'm not a jerk.Instead, I will just eat my 10 fries for dinner, and try out the real gourmet burger place down the street next time I crave a burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rochester?start=60,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003

Food is always pretty good: burgers and onion ring tower rock. But when the place is busy, it's difficult to get anything ""off menu"". I politely asked them to change the tv channel so my two young kids didn't have to watch boxing. The employee forgot and I had to ask someone else.  Then they forgot my 4 year-old son's mac and cheese! My wife had asked for a side of mayo with her order and that was not there as well. The 5 minutes we had to wait for someone to scoop the mac in a bowl was way too long. (I've worked in restaurants for years all through college - I know the process.) So, my wife couldn't start, my son had nothing, and they didn't even come back to give us an update. We were all waiting and watching our food get cold, and there was no comp. On a $50 bill, they should have taken the $5 mac n cheese off.  That was just the climax of a poor situation that had already existed. The service was slow and at times non-existent. I've come before in the middle of a rush where the service was merely subpar, but today was at the tail end of a rush and they wouldn't have done better if they had the food made instantaneously from the Star Trek machine. I'll go back for the burgers, but I know I'll be treated like a number and I'll have to be a ""squeaky wheel"" in order to get decent service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rochester?start=40,2.7600000000000007,2.7600000000000007,2.7600000000000007,2.7600000000000007,2.7600000000000007

On the other side of the business, the food quality unfortunately has taken a huge nose dive in the past few years.  Thick burgers that used to be caramelized, juicy, and full of meatiness now taste like the standard cheap 80/20 patties you can find in any supermarket.  Crispy fried onion strings that used to have texture and flavor now are smaller, floppy, and soggy.  Toppings that used to be fresh now seem day-old (at best) and have typically been overcooked or dried out in my recent experiences.  The food has just lost its sparkle.  I understand the greater business making cuts to still show a profit in the inflating economy, but it's such a shame that what used to be really delicious burgers have turned into perfectly bland and unimpressive average fare.   I'm sure I'll continue to frequent this location from time to time, but I truly wish they could raise their food game again.  Return to your former glory, Red Robin!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rochester?start=40,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.7640000000000002,3.2800000000000002

I rarely get burgers when I go out so I can't speak much to theirs but I like the whiskey grilled bbq chicken sandwich with some avocado. Most recently the grilled chicken was juicy and flavorful. I enjoy the steak fries which are endless and would like to try their sweet potato fries. My friend got a side salad that looked lacking in veggie toppings but fresh. The root beer floats here are frosty and satisfying! I had forgotten how much I love root beer floats. The milk shakes are huge and look like they could be a meal in itself. They also have some spiked shakes that sound worth trying.  They have a great rewards program, sign up and get a free burger during your birthday month.

My latest visit however, was much, much, MUCH less so...With several other empty booths open, the person who sat us had to sit us right on top of the most obnoxious, disrespectful and loud people they could find. Generally this is a practice I'm used to when it comes to restaurants, since they love to cluster everyone together when it's not as busy, but seriously, would it hurt them to be mindful of the people they're seating you by? But that wasn't even the worst of it. The lady who was serving these noisy, rude people, swiped our wireless table order screen for theirs, which apparently wasn't working. This was long after we'd ordered and our total was on the screen, so basically we ended up having our whole order messed up from this. If that wasn't enough, it took them a good 10-15 minutes to rectify this, and mind you there was nobody else there in that area so it's not like they were swamped. OH, and while we were trying to enjoy our food, this was when they were having the trouble with the machine that the other server had dumped on us. So they were at the table THE ENTIRE TIME trying to fix it...not even bothering to take it someplace else so we could eat in peace after the noisy people finally left. Just an all around terrible experience, the server who snatched our screen had no consideration or foresight on what it'd do to our order...or she simply didn't care, more concerned with the loud people she was serving.  needless to say I'm not going back to this location anytime soon, if ever...I couldn't even enjoy the food as the atmosphere was horrible, they have no concept of how to seat people so they can enjoy their meal if it's not packed...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rochester?start=20,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.436,3.1600000000000006

She said, ""Yes, and she would put some in right away"".  Way to be proactive!   I noticed, just as Andrew noted, the Lettuce tasted a day too old.  There was not too much guac on the burger itself, but from what i tasted, it wasn't bad.

We went as a small group, and each of us ordered a burger and fries. Service was quick; we got a table almost immediately and the waitress was quite friendly. Each table had a little tablet device set up. You can order, call for a staff member, and even play games (for a fee) as you wait for your food. I ordered a medium rare Royal Robin Burger, I believe. The over easy egg was perfectly done and allowed for a lot of the drippy yolk to smother the sandwich. I expected the burger to be super dry, but to my surprise, it was actually extremely moist, yet still hard to chew somehow. I didn't really like the burger, to say the least. What I did enjoy were the bottomless herb fries I ordered. They were perfectly seasoned, and they tasted so good that I got addicted pretty quickly and began to stuff myself on them when I got tired of the burger. After a while, my friends started rotating fry baskets around to sample other flavors. For dessert, I had a cheesecake. Smooth, creamy, and topped with a dollop of whipped cream and strawberries for a kick of acidity. To summarize, everything was fine, but I ironically didn't enjoy the menu items that this chain is apparently known for.

This time we came we had to ask twice for silverware and napkins to even begin eating our meal. When we received our meal it was just slapped down on the table and the girl left not asking if we needed anything, nor did anyone come around until we were finished with the meal to ask if we needed anything and if our meal was all right. We had to ask a random waiter walking by that wasn't ours to grab us some campfire sauce and silverware. I so love this place and it's food however your service gets me every time. An extremely large party of our came to Red Robin after a gathering @ RIT, in talking about 30 people and it was about 2 hours before close. The staff was EXTREMELY accommodating and kind when more and more people showed up. We took over the whole booth tables across the wall with another group filling in 3 big red tables and another booth in the back. Service: Speedy and on their game! Our drinks never got down to slurping up melted ice, nor did the endless fries ever see an empty tray. There was one mix up of buffalo and BBQ wings, but it was fixed and out within 5 minutes. The orders all came out correct and in record time. They even sang for our friends birthday!  Food:  Fried pickles- not overly fried, dried out or cold! Also the CAMPFIRE SAUCE that comes with it... fan-flipping-tastic! It tastes exactly like Chik-fil-A's Chik-fil-A sauce which in NY we don't have here, so I can get my CFA fix!! Al. Peppercorn Burger-  Crispyyy (the way I like it!) applewood smoked bacon, melted pepper-jack cheese, a.1. peppercorn spread, crispy onion straws (not soggy) and fresh tomatoes on an onion bun (not overbearingly oniony). I took off the tomatoes-I'm not a fan of them, however I was fan-girling over this choice! If you like cracked pepper anything, you'll love this! I get my burgers well done ( I know, sue me..), but it wasn't dry at all which can happen when cooking the burger to no red.  Fries: Bottomless, steak cut, cooked to perfection- not dry, soggy or too crispy! There are plenty of dipping sauces made in house like the Campfire sauce I totally recommend! Overall: I will be back because of the Campfire sauce and the amazing service!

However the last - and perhaps final - time I ate at their Jefferson Road location, Saturday 11/5/2016, while the food was up to the usual standards, the service, from when we walked in the door to when we left, was off-the-chart awful. Surly hostesses with their backs to guests entering, and making no effort to turn around and greet customers.  Incompetent and unfriendly servers.  Mistakes and omissions in orders. I documented this to their online customer service and received a courtesy gift card.  But as to the specifics of my complaint, neither ""Monica R"" nor ""Kim A"" from their corporate Guest Support were of any help, saying that they needed ""more information"" to investigate - I had told them the time we were in the restaurant, time we paid, that we paid by their own electronic kiosk system, where we sat, and what our tab was, then furnished them with our Red Robin Rewards card number.  What more did they need? I have long felt this place was a 3/4-star experience.  Five for the food, less because the scripted patter is off-putting to me, but they always took good care of my family. Because I had an abysmal experience there, and received no meaningful followup from either their national Guest Services, or their local manager, I want to put this issue out in public.

If you're in the mood for a chain, Red Robin really manages to do everything that a chain does well while also feeling kind of like a family-owned business. Unlimited fries are my JAM. (Though if you're feeling differently, they also have things like sweet potato fries for an upcharge, or unlimited broccoli.) And their burgers are great. Best value is the tavern doubles which are a little smaller than a typical burger, but when you're doing fries like I am, it is so worth it. Their ""typical"" gourmet burgers are great, too, and then if you're in the mood for something more their specialty burgers are bomb. The best is the DGB. Higher quality meat. Cooked to perfection. Just amazing. Order it and you'll thank me later. In terms of appetizers, there's a bunch to please a crowd. My go tos are the Onion Rings (the breading on them is AMAZING) that come in two sizes depending on if you're a big or small party and the (recently re-added) northern poutine fries.

The bruschetta chicken is one of my usual favorites. However the chicken was burnt and it had a real funny taste to it. I ended up eating my roll without the chicken. I had drinks too.

Nestled between a Home Depot and a Marshall's, this burger palladium overlooks a five story office building devoid of any names or interesting qualities. The mystery view is yours to devour while you sink your paws into a slab of meat embedded between two pads of white bread half the radius of your own skull.  The staff will greet you at the door if they can be bothered to look up from their phone where they are undoubtedly snap chatting Brad. There's always a Brad and you either know him or want to be him. These people KNOW Brad, YOU do not know Brad. You can have a Coke.  Their restaurant is filled with screaming children and Americana memorabilia. No matter what time or day... a group of servers is clapping and screaming for someone's birthday. The insane performance comes with a uhaul of ice cream followed by Walter Brimley presenting you with a diabetic meter and free test strips.  Try their onion tower, smells like heart disease fried in veggie oil, tastes like America.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rochester,3.28,3.28,3.28,,3.2800000000000002

The hostess was an older woman not very welcoming or friendly just dropped our menus off at the table and walked away. Our waitress however was awesome! Very informative and helpful. Got a bacon cheeseburger and it just wasn't  flavorful. It wasn't gross but didn't satisfy me especially for the price.The garlic fries they have are really good, I'd suggest those over the plain ones.

27,Atia Q.,"Rochester, NY",1,5,,1.0,2017-06-17,"Okay. I probably should have known better but I'd never been to Red Robin and was curious about their ""gourmet burgers"". I blame tv advertising for luring me with unrealistic images. First impressions: the place has a sort of crowded layout, and the floor is so dirty it's slippery with that slick greasy residue you get on tile that has never seen soap. The table was greasy, had crumbs on it and so did the seat. My husband had an ""I told you so"" look on his face as we ""slipped"" into our booth. Even the salt shakers and condiment bottles on the table were greasy. I literally broke out my hand sanitizer once this was pointed out to me. The server was nice, especially once she started listening to me and stopped pushing the appetizer specials. She was also the only server actually working (there were about 5 other waitresses hanging out at the bar area ignoring everyone around them). Looking at the menu, it was busy and tough to figure out, and the prices were listed in the smallest font size known to man. This is because these prices are ridiculously high considering how not fancy this chain seems to be! $14 for a burger with soggy lettuce and meat that tastes like they got it from McDonalds? Nope! The endless fries were reheated, and round two was undercooked. Finally, it turns out we weren't the only ones having trouble with the floors, as the group leaving behind us also stopped to wipe their shoes on the rug on the way out. Needless to say, there will not be a return trip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rochester?start=20,3.2,3.2,3.2,,3.2000000000000006
17,Jeanne G.,"Carlock, IL",99,12,,1.0,2017-07-07,"Select another restaurant there are lots nearby. The milkshake was melted. The food was cold. It got sent back and manager came out to apologize which was a joke because he was at the table for 3 seconds and he was apologizing to the people across the aisle too .. and at the same time. The waitress thought that friendly made up for poor service .. and did I mention they only had 6 tables of people in the place. When you only have one thing to do .. which is deliver food acceptable for eating .. and by the way this is what you do .. Poor service, poor quality of food, and a filthy greasy floor that needs mopping because you slide across it as you walk through the restaurant and a hostess that was completely missing, leaving guests waiting in the front entrance, ranks as the AVOID AT ALL COST establishment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rochester,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005
2,Michelle K.,"Glenview, IL",43,5,,4.0,2017-08-27,"Came here on a late afternoon with my boyfriend just wanting to eat something small and the host who brought us to the table said that she was sorry the tables we were being placed in were messy and used the words ""retarded people"" in front of us. We were both in shock and kept asking each other if we heard that correctly. Hearing the host say that made us feel very insulted. We weren't very sure on how to order as the mini screen on our table didn't have the full menu and even clicking on the button to call a server, no one came to help us for about 15 mins until we had to call over a server who was taking care of another table. We complained about the slow service and how rude the host was being in front of us. We don't know her name but she has blonde hair and tattoos and we gave her a big tip. The manager came to us and apologized about the long wait and the host's rudeness. The manager took out one of the burgers from our bill, and we got out food right away after from the manger himself which I thought was very professional and brings out the vibe that customers are the top priority. We left very happy and didn't change our mind on this place. We would have given his experience a much worse star but the host who helped us and the manager really made this experience very well received.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rochester,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006

Today it took a while to be greeted by our server and even longer to get drinks.  When I received my wine, the glass was filthy and had lipstick stains in it.  We order chips and salsa, when they eventually did come the chips were burnt. Thought it was fairly busy no one seemed concerned that these things happened to us. We came to the conclusion that we will not come back.

ABOMINABLE service, both on the part of the waitress and the manager I flagged down to complain about the wait for our orders - I've sent an email to corporate outlining today's fiasco. Oh and the fries were soggy too - yuck. I/we won't be going back any time soon!!

1,Sara H.,"Lima, NY",11,6,,2.0,2017-10-14,"I was craving a really good hamburger and fries so my son and I went out tonight for dinner. Very disappointing experience. The hostess forgot to seat us, so when people that came in after us were seated before us I checked in again. She got us seated in what is probably the worst table. Super small next to kitchen.  Hamburger was ok. Nothing like the picture depicted. I was hoping for big burger with great flavor and I got an over cooked thin dry patty.  The endless fries were cold and overdone. I think that's on purpose so you don't actually want to order more.  With all of the choices of restaurants I would not ever go back.

Our server came over and said are you ready to order, I replied that we just sat down. Asked for crayons, she says they are all out. Didn't even offer pens for the kids to draw. Two min later asked again if we were ready, what's the rush? Place is dead empty. Say at far end and heard cooks and waitresses yelling jokes at each other from front to back kitchen. Holy Crap did this place go downhill from years ago. Keep driving!! No water refills. Two kids meals missing sauces and lemons that were in the pic. Had to ask for the tarter sauce for fish! Heard another waitress tell our waitress, ""now I remember why I hate serving"". This place is pure trash!!!

7,Adam K.,"Celebration, Orlando, FL",1,32,7.0,1.0,2017-12-28,"My mother requested a birthday dinner from here as she hadn't been in a long time.  We were seated in a booth, right outside the bar area. No wait and not busy. After being seated by the host, we wait a solid 10 minutes before anyone stopped by. No apology was given for the long wait. Our complete order was taken by a bartender whom I observed was busy with to go orders. The appetizer was brought out quickly and hot. That was the only good part. After that, drinks went empty and when eventually replenished, empty cups were not removed. Thirty minutes after with no explanation why the two entrees were taking so long, I gave up and asked for a manager. The food was delivered while our table was a mess with appetizer dishes. The food runner looked at me as she had no where to put my food down. Right as the food was delivered, manager Chris showed up. I told Chris that the service was horrible and we were there for a birthday dinner. He asked for us to enjoy our food while it was hot and he would ""figure something out."" Chris never returned to the table. While the food was very poor in quality (extreme lack of toppings and looked nothing like pictures), it was later in the evening and we were hungry. The server became a bit more attentive once I informed her I involved a manager, however, she still never offered an apologize for anything. When I paid on the Zoosk, I learned one of our entrees was deleted - we were still responsible for the appetizer, drinks and one entree. It would have been nice for Chris to stop by one more time and/or inform us of what he did to help out and/or acknowledge my mother's birthday in some fashion for guest recovery. But he and his team failed full circle. I was visiting from out of state and my mother certainly will not be returning or recommending.

0,Brent A.,"Rochester, NY",125,173,26.0,4.0,2018-01-09,"Red Robin is the burger hub when it comes to chain restaurants. It's a mainstay in Henrietta and with their typical burger fair menu, you can't go wrong with any choice. I typically go here for lunch and the the lunch crowd isn't extensive. The large seating area past the bar provides a lot of extra room for larger parties. The service is always incredibly friendly and helpful as well.  If I'm in the mood for a serious burger, I would look elsewhere. However, for lunch or a quicker bite to eat, Red Robin checks those boxes.  Also fries.
