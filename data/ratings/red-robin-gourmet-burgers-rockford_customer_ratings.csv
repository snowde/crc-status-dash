36,Ryan J.,"Nashville, TN",49,12,15.0,2.0,2012-01-31,"I have always loved Red Robin. I was going for a good experience. Once I got there I found out that this location doesn't list what I thought was one of their signature sides, ""Garlic Parmesan Steak Fries"". However upon request they did make them for me. I sat at the bar so the service I got from there was good. That is about where the positive ended though. Nobody ever brought my food so the bartender went to check on it. She came back with my food but everything was ice cold. It appeared to have sat in the window for a very long time. Upon request she brought me fresh Parmesan Fries. I was so hungry that I just suffered through most of my Chicken sandwich.

When we arrived at the table it was dirty and had dinnerware from the previous diners on it.  Our server apologized and cleaned up, but still...we shouldn't have had to deal with that. All in all, the food was decent, not anything I would rave about and I wouldn't pay 9.99 for a burger I could get for 4 dollars at Burger King.  Fries were a bit salty as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rockford?start=20,2.348,2.348,2.348,2.348,2.348

Upon entering we were greeted by a less than excited male host and were taken to our table near the rest room, not a Problem because I had to go when we got there. Our waitress Tina was polite and eager to make suggestions. She suggested pretzel bits for an appetizer. I was not as impressed with them as Tina was. I mean ..they were little bits of warm pretzel with a little cup of cheese sauce. Not really worth what they charged. The smoke house burger I got  and had upgraded to ""monster"" on Tina's suggestion was AWSOME!!!!  It was just that monster sized oh yeah. The burger was a bit too juicy as it dripped all over the  plate. That is the only bitch I have about the food. I was also introduced to another foreign concept bottomless fries. Tina's service was pretty good my wife went through two lemonande's and I never even saw Tina switch out the glasses. She came by and checked on us enough to be attentive but not bothersome. My wife also enjoyed her garden burger which she described as good enough to not know she was eating a garden burger. The bill was high for what we had almost fifty dollars for two sandwiches a lemonade and an ice tea  oh and the ""pretzel bits"". All in all not terrible but not great either.

Some restaurants of the chain are better than the others. Depends on who is cooking the food. The burgers are so big, juicy, and tasty! You can get two patties if you want (and I do)! The fries are hot and fresh! Crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside! The waiters/waitresses have always brought me my burgers within a reasonable time exactly how I ordered them.

I was amazed at the tv playing golf under the floor when I walked in. Plenty of variety of both food, drinks and shows on tv's. Burger I had was cheaper- around $7 and was pointed out before hand it would be a bit smaller than normal. Which was fine because I was not that hungry anyway.

Then when dinner came all of our meals came out except for my daughter's.  The waitress claimed the cooks forgot her meal. She didn't get her meal for about 15 minutes after we received ours which by that time we were all just about done eating our meals. When i complained to management they claimed that the waitress not the cooks forgot.  At the end of the meal they overcharged me for drinks by a crazy $15 then after pointing out the error they messed the check up again twice more.

The food came out relatively fast which is why when I bit into my cold pink burger I was a bit surprised. It couldn't have sat out a long time.

But they have the world's most dysfunctional loyalty program reducing to 3-stars.  Today I literally had to reconcile my past Red Robin visits using my credit card company app to prove to them how many times I have actually eaten there. That's because your manager essentially accused me of trying to defraud Red Robin one extra point worth what...70-cents????  The loyalty program fails to register every visit. The loyalty program has never worked with my telephone number meaning I have to search through 2-dozen spam emails from red robin to give them the actual long account number. Program not good at every store. Program not good in Texas or Alaska. Loyalty program not good in downtown Chicago. Lost my free birthday lunch because I ate there on a business expense account and they forced me to take my free birthday lunch essentially giving it to my employer. Hassles dealing with corporate toll-free number and website. Despite all of these problems your manager told me that it is a great loyalty program and these problems are all mine. So we know the customer is always wrong!!  A loyalty program should create loyal fans. I would be a fan of red Robin except for the fact I hate your loyalty program due to all the hassle.  Your three stars gets reduced to two due to no wifi...I have to burn my data plan sitting in your restaurant because you want to ""turn tables faster.""  Again, nice customer service attitude! 4 or 5 stars based on food and service...2 stars based on management!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rockford?start=20,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52

2,Eva H.,"Roscoe, IL",28,1,3.0,1.0,2017-07-30,Worst burger ever had to eat it with a fork fell apart right away not a gourmet burger . I was pretty upset since I don't go out to eat too much and I've had better burgers other places for way less cost. Want a great burger firehouse pub in roscoe 5.99 on Thursday and the burger is big. My burger that night was the width of a mcdonalds. Burger,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rockford,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6
6,Thomas H.,"Rockford, IL",18,2,,1.0,2017-08-17,"If you prefer to have an average or below food experience, Red Robin is the place. Upon entering, the floor was so slippery I almost fell several times. Our table for six was in the center. It was virtually impossible to hear conversation over the sound bouncing off all the reflective surfaces. My Guacamole Bacon burger was tasteless and the fries were limp and luke warm. Even the beer l ordered, which was on the drink board, had run out. Not a great experience for food or fun.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rockford,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6
1,Bill B.,"Madison, AL",1939,478,1562.0,2.0,2017-12-08,"The burger and fries were average.  The burger was on the small size and only about 12 french fries were served on the plate.  Yes, you can order more fires, but to only serve 12 fries is not good.  Then they use those stupid Ziosk Kiosks.  I hate those things, especially at Red Robin because they don't work.  You need the waitress to punch the buttons to check out.  Crazy, cumbersome, and difficult system and not customer centric. My ticket before tip was $13.96.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-rockford,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
