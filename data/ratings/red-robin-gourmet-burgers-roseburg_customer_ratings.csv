His fish on the other hand was just okay. I had the chicken salad and the chicken was overly processed and the greens were mostly iceberg. This is a burger joint so I should have known better.

52,Jay M.,"Sherwood, OR",19,157,50.0,5.0,2013-04-14,"Stopped there for lunch on the way home on Saturday. It was just the right time after 11am and just ahead of the rush. I have eaten plenty of times at RR in Hillsboro and only twice in my own hometown of Sherwood (due to bad service). The food is always good and pretty consistent. But, this review for the RR in Roseburg, OR is mainly for service. We were seated promptly and immediately met our server. She took our drink order and reviewed specials quickly. My wife asked about the new mini-wedge salad and got great advice from the server. I asked for some fries to hit the table early and we quickly had another young man drop them off at the table. She took our orders and was super-engaged with us. Our iced tea was never empty and we had frequent check-ins to see if everything was ok. The reason I left a review is because my wife commented again on how good the service at this store was. If management reads this review, please give the opening manager and team from Saturday April 13th, 2013 a pat on the back. I would normally give my local RR barely 2-3 stars and my Hillsboro one 4 stars for their food and service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roseburg?start=40,3.604,3.604,3.604,3.604,3.6040000000000005

Example: order what I am told is a pint of beer, I get it and it is short two inches from the top. The manager, dickh@*d something, tells me when I insist that I ordered and paid for a pint that I get a pint. He smirks and shows me some silly glass corporate barons of Red Robin give as example of how to pour draft beer. It is two inches below the rim, both on the 16 oz and the 22 oz.

She asked about our PGR patches. We explained to her that we stand with our American flag for any military veteran, law enforcement or fire fighter in honor at their funerals. Kaila came back and told us that she felt humbled that we would ride into town to do this and that she bought our beverages for us. The restaurant then wanted to provide a discount to us.

We ordered 2 waters, the BLTA croissant and a bacon cheeseburger with no tomatoes. Our waters were brought to us quickly but I was given a very dirty glass. I asked for a new one and it was replaced but not happily, then I realized that I had also been given dirty silverware. My husband received his bacon cheeseburger but it was just barely warm, had tomatoes on it and no mayo, when speaking to the waitress, she acted like she didn't care. At this point I was pretty pissed because I was given dirty dishes and my husbands cheeseburger was cold, and incorrect. We then spoke to the manager who also acted like he didn't care.  Treating your customers like the only thing that matters is their money is not the best way to keep repeat customers. I am a firm believer (and yes I've worked in the food industry) that if someone pays for food it should be as ordered, if a mistake is made then it should be fixed and they should at the very least apologize.  We will not be going back because the best thing about this place is their honey mustard and steak fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roseburg?start=20,3.8,3.8,3.8,,3.8

12,Jeff G.,"Roseburg, OR",18,3,,2.0,2016-12-18,Well I will start this with saying we came in with a    big group. It was not crowded but our service  was bad. We had half of our order come out before our drinks and apps. We refilled our own water. Messed up 2 of our orders. Very forgetful and slow service. Like always the birthday song was awesome.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roseburg,3.8,3.8,3.8,,3.8
14,Trevor M.,"Roseburg, OR",10,5,3.0,1.0,2017-03-10,The server took forever to get our order. When we got our order we had to wait 30 minutes to get utensils. When we got our food it was cold and I ordered no pink in my burger and there was pink. This is not the first time that this has happened I'm about ready to give up on coming here. On top of all that the table was full of dirty dishes and our drinks took forever to get refilled. The manager was standing right next to our table lovely. If I could give less than a stat I would. If you could avoid this place I suggest you do,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roseburg,3.64,3.64,3.64,,3.6400000000000006

Two many tables were dirty as we walked all the way to the back and sat by the bathrooms.  Yuck  The waiter took forever to come to our table.  We ordered everything at once ... drinks, appetizer, side salad, and entrée.  The waiter comes back saying they took away the appetizer that we wanted but hadn't changed the menu.  I told him ok, just bring my salad before the meal.  He finally returned with the whole meal. Salad and chicken strip basket.  I asked for a side plate.  He DID NOT get my salad before the meal. He brought everything together  He DID NOT get my side plate first.  He stopped and took the order from the table behind me which took 3 minutes because they couldn't make up their mind about what they wanted and he stopped next to take his coworkers order.... another 3 minutes because she ordered 4 items all in a special way.  The fries were warm not hot.  Never asked if we wanted a refill on the fries.  I asked for a large water and large coke to go. I didn't expect them free even though I ordered 2 cokes with our meal.  He brought 1 water and 1 empty cup so I could pour my left over Coke in it.  The next time I'm driving through Roseburg I'll be sure to not stop and eat anywhere around there.

They sat us in a cramped corner with people right next to us, literally rubbing elbows when there was 5 tables around us. I had a newborn in carrier and 4 people and they sat us at table with 4 chairs and other tables too close to even but the baby carrier anywhere. They were slow and our food was cold!

Our waitress sucked, I had to ask for a fork just to start eating my salad, my husbands salmon sandwich and my burger where soggy!
