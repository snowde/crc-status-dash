I have been here many times, it's never so packed you have to wait, but always busy, and i've never had a bad meal, or bad service here. Wow, there was alot of fucking commas in that sentence just now!!  I'm not a huge fan of the fries, which are endless, btw, but i've been here with some guys who were more than happy about bottomless fries!!  They have good apps and salads, and the staff is pretty friendly. I love their burgers, and I've other stuff from the menu and it is all good, all I have tried anyway.  It's not romantic, or frilly, and it's not gonna be the best meal you've had in your life, but it's good solid food, good portions, and good prices..   it's a good go-to place when you're hungry and can't think of anywhere else to go. Yes, that actually does happen to me sometimes, my brain gets over-thunk!!  Crap, I just looked over and seen my review is similar to Nicole T... but we differ on the fries.  LOL!!  They have a full bar too.  So get yer fuckin' drinks on!!  /Standby!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roseville-2?start=40,2.416,2.416,2.416,2.416,2.416

I love the fact that you can get other sides besides steak fries with the burgers.  Now I love steak fries - but I will sit there and eat basket after basket of them.  Have to avoid them completely.  I ordered my Garden Burger with a side of Freckled Fruit Salad.  The fruit did not have freckles, but it was extremely tasty.

64,Tim K.,"Fraser, MI",261,289,51.0,4.0,2013-07-22,"I love me some Red Robin especially the Royal Red Robin Burger which was the first time I ever experienced a fried egg of a burger. It's pretty epic if I may say so. What would make it even better is if the egg was cooked over medium or over easy so you had the creamy runny yolk spill out and mix with the burger. I am guessing if I ask for it made that way they would. I was also surprised at how good the Buzzard (Chicken) Wings were when we first got them and it has become a favorite as a appetizer when we dine there. They are crispier than other Wings I have had, but they are still tender and juicer and the buffalo sauce they use is pretty spot on. Not a fan of the Blue Cheese though so I sub that out for Ranch instead. Service is usually always fast we have never really had any issues with that minus a few instances here and there. Mike #4 (there used to be three others from what he told us) though is the best Server that place has and may be the best Server at any restaurant I have been to. I joke by saying he is better than Mike's 1 through 3 combined, but it is the truth.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roseville-2?start=40,2.352,2.352,2.352,2.352,2.352

63,Rachel K.,"Charter Township of Clinton, MI",106,173,3.0,1.0,2013-09-22,"Ok, I know that one-star is harsh because I have had other visits to this location that were fine but this time was REALLY that bad. Obviously, as a son-of-2-foodies, my four year old gets to pick the places to eat for his b-day.  Morning time was pancakes... Part ""deux"" was Red Robin.  Oh, son, you have much to learn.  None the less, on the way to meet up with my parents here (a whole 1/2 mile from my house) I almost got smacked by a speeding Grandma in a minivan exiting the Macomb mall... that should have been my first clue to stay home. Upon arriving, it's PACKED. There's like 20 (with anxiety AND almost getting hit in the lot it appears and sounds more like 200) children in the lobby of the place and we have to wait for 20 minutes.  The wait isn't really an issue... we should have called ahead.  I think we probably only waited closer to just over 10 minutes anyways.   We are seated and almost immediately Arica comes to take our order.  Well, no, hun... we haven't really even sat down but I'm staring at the drink menu (because speeding granny + loud children =I NEED some alcohol ASAP) and I order the first thing on the page (freckled lemonade).  My dad gets a regular drink, my mom gets a beer, and my son gets a lemonade. So, a little while later and we order our meals (drinks still haven't came because ""The bar is really backed up"").  My son gets a kid's meal and lets Arica know it's his birthday (HINT HINT - this means we want the annoying song and clapping gig).  My Dad gets some burger and my mom and I get the same burger only she gets hers well-done and I get mine medium-well with no tomato/lettuce.   So finally my mom's beer, and my dad and I's drink come (my kid still has no lemonade).  I'm tasting my drink and I'm like ""Yo... either I'm an alkie or there's no liquor in this.""  My dad can't taste any either.  We catch Arica going past and ask her about my son's lemonade and I tell her I am not sure I have the right drink since I can't taste alcohol.  She says ""I didn't know you wanted the alcoholic one.""  Ummm... if I wanted non-alcoholic I would have A.) Said so B.) Not been staring at the drink menu.  So she takes it away (and leaves us wondering why it took so long at the bar to get my mom 1 beer since that was supposedly the hold up).   So... 10 minutes later (no drink in site... not even water) Arica returns and tells me ""the strawberries are frozen so I might want to order something else.""  I pick out a margarita... thinking you CAN'T fuck this up.   Here comes the food - great.  But wait... I don't have a drink and my son STILL doesn't have his lemonade. (we remind her again) She comes back 5 minutes lter with my original drink (now with vodka). Guess who STILL doesn't have his lemonade?   My burger tastes dry as hell... but at this point I don't care.  Mid-way through I look at it and there isn't an iota of pink in it.  I'm like ""Does this look like medium well to you?""... everyone agrees it doesn't.  My mother shows me her almost finished burger and says ""This does... I just shut my eyes and didn't think about it.""  So she got MY burger with toppings and I got HER dried out ass burger with no tomatoe.  (Thanks Mom.)  I just set it down and didn't bother asking for a bag.  After a third request, Arica FINALLY returned with the lemonade... which was after we were all done eating.   She comes up to me and tells me ""I'm bringing the bill but I had to take off that drink you ordered so you don't get charged for it.""  Um... duh, don't do me any favors....cuz I certainly wasn't going to pay for it.  We don't even bring up the birthday issue at this point (even though he doesn't understand why everyone else got a song but him as plenty of other birthdays were there)... I tell my son we're going to Coldstone across the street, left her a 10% that she hardly deserved and dipped. I get it when it's slow... it's going to be a wait.  I totally understand that.  The wait was NOT the issue.  The consistent inaccuracy, ignoring a special request, serving the wrong food AND wrong drink AND/OR NO drink, was unacceptable.  Probably the WORST service I've encountered in quite a long time.  I think the only thing they got right was the onion rings. lol I hope that was either an off-day or someone needs to think about a career change.  Hey, I was a sucky waitress a million years ago... but I did everyone a favor and quit. I will probably come back if it's not packed (or go to a different location) if my kid requests it only because it's so close... but I will make sure I have any server besides this one.  I feel badly, because maybe she's a nice person (she gave 100 empty apologies) but this is NOT her calling.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roseville-2?start=40,2.02,2.02,2.02,2.02,2.02

All of the choices in the world and I had to give Red Robin another shot.  I have always felt this place is way overpriced and a bizarre concept of a full liquor bar and kid friendly atmosphere.   I mean, what could possibly go wrong? So on the menu was the limited edition Oktoberfest Burger and Sam Adams Oktoberfest Beer, so that's exactly the direction I was going.  Good choice!  Good shaved Black Forest Ham, Sauteed Onions, Provolone Cheese and a Dark Brown Mustard on a lovely Pretzel Roll.  So full of flavor, cooked to a turn and there were some home fries involved (pic uploaded).  Burger was great, fries seemed to have sit for a bit, but not bad.  The Sam Adams really pulled it all together. The girl seemed new, really new.  She eventually led me to the best burger on the menu so she is forgiven.  But seriously, the least possible qualification is to know your product.

This week being the holidays, a lot of friends in from out of town looking to get together.  Someone (NOT ME!) threw out the idea of Red Robin, I really just want to see my friends and planned on skipping the meal.  We have a group of 11-12 so we knew calling a day or two in advance would be key.   I called to make the reservation and the girl says ""Sorry, we only do call ahead seating."" and I tell her ""Well it isn't for today, it is for Thursday and we will have about 12 people."" ""Nope. Sorry.""  Why do places do this?  I can understand if I was calling for 4 people.  I was a server for 4 years, if someone called in advance for 12 we would be thrilled!!  We can plan seating and make sure we have enough staff to cover a group of that size without chaos being thrown into the mix!  Well forget you Red Robin, we went some place (Thank goodness) that DOES accept reservations and would like our money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roseville-2?start=40,2.02,2.02,2.02,2.02,2.02

We were seated in a two top table when the place was dead. Seriously my biggest pet peeve at a restaurant.  The menu is pretty extensive but what I noticed was everything was so expensive. I don't mind paying for something when the quality and quantity fits the price.  My $9 burger didn't fit that description.  My burger was dry and flavorless. Bun was had and the bottomless fries were soggy and cold.  The place reminded me of a Burger King except I've had 1) better burgers at BK and 2) the service is better at BK.

71,Caitlin M.,"Macomb, MI",0,4,,3.0,2015-01-30,"I honestly really like Red Robin. Its just this location that always gives me hassle. My boyfriend and I fancied a burger. Our server, Shirley, was lovely! I ordered the bailey's milkshake (I love it), and she asks to see my license. I was in the process of getting it renewed, so I have the paper stapled to my license from the secretary of state etch. She says she needs to show it to her manager. She comes back, and says that she can't serve me alcohol, because the manager thinks it doesn't look like a real license. The poor girl is apologizing profusely, my boyfriend and I ask to speak to the manager. He comes over, is rude from the start, and says I'm not being served alcohol. I am low maintenance, and I'm not going to get all emotional because I can't get a drink. I told the manager that its ridiculous, and he obviously thinks I'm a liar. He just walked away. Shirley is so apologetic and embarrassed, but we reassure her its not her fault. She hardly charged us for our meal, and we gave her a 50% tip, and wrote how lovely the service was, but how awful management is.  So, we decide to give the place another try, and I have my new license, and guess what? They're out of bailey's for the milkshake. Our server, Sara, was lovely, which made up for it. My fries came out 15 mins after my entrée, but whatever! They have the best fries! Then, we go back a third time, and ask for Shirley. She's amazing!! I ask for the bailey's milkshake, and they're STILL out of bailey's. Its been 4/5 weeks!! I work in the restaurant industry, and my partner and I always tip at least 30%.

The parking lot was half full and many booths and tables were open. Perfect right? Well, not for this location. The hostess walked up, said nothing other than ""how many"" and she asked for our name. I questioned why and she told us we had a 20 minute wait. WHAT!? I asked why the wait, and pointed out several tables that were open and she replied, "" our kitchen is busy, so we're giving them a break"". So we're supposed to sit by the door (it's freezing outside) and wait till they feel like working, with 2 kids in tow? That's stupid.

41,Jonathan N.,"Detroit, MI",0,4,,1.0,2015-05-07,"Ordered a double cheeseburger and when the food came back 30 mins later it only had one patty. I asked if it was correct and the waitress said she would ask the cook. The description in the menu I showed her should have been an indicator. She said she would put the order in again. Another 30 mins goes by and they bring me my food and it's still wrong. The cheeseburger was smaller than a McDouble. I'm not the type of person to complain but this was getting ridiculous. Keep in mind that the waitress did not refill our drinks or fries which was all I had eaten at this point. I then asked to see the manager. She was also no help at all. She claimed that was the burger I ordered and said that two Kid patties equalled a 6 oz. regular patty. I asked her then ""why was I paying two dollars more for the same amount of meat."" She replied with ""I don't make the prices, that's corporate."" The manager gave me the disappointing burger for free. I just wanted to leave at this point but our waitress was avoiding us like we had Ebola. I went to the front waitstaff table and asked if I could just pay there. I was told the bar could take care of it. I went up to the bar and asked to be checked out. The bartender said that my waitress had to give me the bill and I had to pay through her. He then called for her to give us the bill. She was playing on her phone and looked up and gave the bartender a dirty look. Finally she gave us the bill. I gave her my debit card and she left and came right back with it. Normally I am very generous with the tip. I've been known to tip up to 40%. I couldn't justify giving the waitress a tip after the experience I had. It was difficult for me because at one time I only was paid on tips. I didn't eat the burger after that because by the time I got it it was cold and my fiancé had long been finished with her food. I then drove down to I-696 and Gratiot to Seaburger Cheeseburger and had a great experience. The food there was freshly made and delicious, the gentleman there was very nice as well. Just one of the burgers I got at Seaburger Cheeseburger was the size of what I was given at Red Robin and it's considered a slider.

She was an all around great server- The food came in a timely manner, and it was good.  Burgers were cooked how we liked and it ended up to be a good lunch stop for a change. I wouldn't say it was the best burger I've had but it was not the worst. LOL  Nice stop for lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roseville-2,2.4,2.4,2.4,2.412,2.4
17,Dylan T.,"Auburn Hills, MI",3,10,,4.0,2016-01-29,"Good, reliable, consistent Red Robin location. The area where it's located is kind of bombed out (as is most of Gratiot on this stretch), so this is kind of an oasis of good sit-down food in this part of town. The Smoke & Pepper burger I had tasted good and was done to my specifications. Their sweet potato fries were actually pretty good. As every single chain seeks to add them to their menus, I've had more than my fair share of bad ones, but Red Robin (or at least this Red Robin) does it right. Good atmosphere, and really attentive and friendly service.

Doesn't matter if it's the dinner hour on a Saturday or a Thursday evening, they act like every shift is a slog. It's a shame, this place was once a destination for my family.
