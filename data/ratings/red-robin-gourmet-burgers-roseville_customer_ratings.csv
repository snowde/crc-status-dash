It is all I get, I can never bring myself to order anything else... Not a good place to get to go... Soggy fast... Minus one star because its just SO LOUD and service can be so so, booze is a rip off and sometimes food isnt always prepared the same way... They have bottomless fries that usually come out scalding hot, all 5 of them...

I'm not sure why it seems we have 5 different servers helping us at once, but it gets really hectic in there! They bring out the food, and then another comes to check on you, another brings your condiments, and not one of them will remove the excess plates or glassware that pile up on your table. By the time we are done, we could barely see the other side of the table. I know I can eat and all, but it'd be nice to have some order of operation when eating at Red Robin.

I know its a traing place for employees there but thats no excuse for unforgettable service , they should be trained on interacting with their guests and more attentiveness no matter how busy they are.

I had a hankering for burgers that week, so I insisted we hit up a burger joint. We landed on this one. I ordered a Sauteed 'Shroom because I have a weakness for mushrooms in my burger. For $10, that burger was so-so. Kinda dry. I ate half and brought the rest home with me. Their Platinum Patron Margarita for $9 was pretty strong, so I was a happy camper drinks-wise.

231,Kris C.,"Monterey, CA",44,44,13.0,3.0,2012-11-28,"The service was perfectly fine, food was good, but the atmosphere was like being at Chuck E. Cheese. I'm aware that when you go to a family restaurant that you will more than likely have to deal with kids, but this was ridiculous. There wasn't a birthday party or any other such event, just a LOT of families with a lot of kids that no one was watching. We watched one child, about 5, play around in her chair, drink in hand, & parents said nothing. This kid then fell backwards off the chair, spilling her drink all over the floor. The parents STILL did nothing until a couple servers came over to help the kid up. Really?! No one bothered cleaning up the spilled drink so it was walked through & tracked all about the floor. Another table had a two year old screaming (& I mean high-pitched screams) at the top of her lungs for the entire meal. When my husband & I walked out, the silence was deafening after all the noise. I know its not the fault of the restaurant that some parents are idiots who shouldn't have had children if they didn't intend to watch them, but if next time I want to eat in such an atmosphere, I'll go to Chuck E. Cheese. PS - I have a kid & 2 psycho dogs, so I'm no stranger to noise & obnoxious behavior.

223,Nicole B.,"Citrus Heights, CA",133,191,84.0,5.0,2012-12-12,"I am a huge fan of Red Robin in general, but this is by far my favorite restaurant location. I have been here numerous times and the host/hostess always opens the door for customers and greets them with a smile. For the most part I am seated fairly quickly. Even at its busiest it doesn't take too long to get a table. The staff turns over tables very efficiently. I can be a very picky eater, but the waiters/waitresses have always been polite and patient while taking my order. I also often split meals and the staff is kind enough to plate that meal separately for me and my guest making it much more convenient to share. The wait staff is also very attentive, frequently checking on the table for refills or to see if everything tastes alright.  The atmosphere is very casual and social. It is a great place to bring family, friends and children. They also offer takeout and are very quick to get your food to you while not compromising the quality of the food. All in all, I have never had an unpleasant experience at this Red Robin location. The prices and food quality are good and I always leave full and satisfied. They have the best fries I have ever had! While I have tried many items off of their menu a few of my favorites are: The Burnin' Love Burger, The California Chicken Sandwich and the Southwest Grilled Chicken Salad. The only negative thing I can say about this location is that the parking situation is awful. They share a lot with two neighboring restaurants and a shopping center which can make parking a complete nightmare, taking up to 15-20 minutes to find a spot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roseville?start=220,3.6,3.6,3.6,3.3800000000000003,3.6000000000000005

The world famous fries tasted like plastic....they are clearly not real food. They were hot but didn't taste like potato.  Icky. We tried to pay and it took forever.

I have been coming to red robin since it first opened this location about 13 years ago (?) and I still order the same thing that I ordered the first time I came: crispy chicken burger and a side salad with ranch dressing. I don't come here often, by any means, however, when I do come once every few months, my regular order always tastes the same: hot, crunchy chicken with all the produce on a soft bun with a side of hot steak fries. The only thing that has changed is the side salad. It is still pretty good, but it was better when it was topped with cheese and tortilla strips. The service here is actually really friendly, maybe overly friendly, seeing as when I came here with my sister last night we were told by 5 different people on the way out to ""have a wonderful evening!""

I would rather go just about anywhere else but here.  The one thing that Red Robin has been known for is their bottomless french fries, and the fact that you can get a basket of french fries before your meal arrives.  They have gotten a bit cheap in the french fry department.  If they bring you out fries before dinner arrives, they bring you out a basket that is maybe a quarter filled with fries.  3 of us shared a basket, and seriously there were 10 french fries in that basket.  Then when they bring out dinner, they no longer bring you french fries in a basket, they bring french fries in a cup.  Again, very few fries  You have to keep waiting for them to bring you more fries, and when you like them extra crunchy like my husband and I do it is a bit inconvenient.  He finished his burger before his next batch of fries arrived.  I always maintain you don't mess with what you're known for!

I had family come from out of country and I was excited to have them try it, specially the ""bottomless fries."" However, with the service we got I was embarrassed to say I even recommended it. We first got there and got sat, it took about 10 minutes for us to be even greeted by our server. At that time we were ready to order. Our drinks came out 15 minutes later (not even water was brought out) so here we are sitting at an empty table, thirsty and getting hungry. I had ordered my fave, the Freckled Lemonade.. I had to ask another server to refill it because my server never did. I asked my server 3 times to bring me another lemonade before she finally brought me one. Our food order took about 30 minutes to come, which at this point I was already agitated because we were hungry and the service was making me upset. Once we got our food, I saw that Red Robin changed the presentation of the food and now have the fries in this circular metal holder. One of them came with 5 French fries... 5!!! My cousin didn't mind because it's supposed to be bottomless so we all ordered another round of fries and waited.... And waited.... Asked again (at this point I kept time)... And waited.. And waited.. And asked again. Which our server replied, ""it should be on its way."" Yeah it should have been out 10 minutes ago. Watched as the tables around us received their fries. Everyone had FINISHED eating their meals before our fries came out, which took about 25 minutes to come out. There ""bottomless fries"" were a joke. At that point I was embarrassed. I like my fries with my burger. Not as a dessert.  The entire experience was pretty bad. I don't think I'll go back, which is a bummer cause I really like the Blue Ribbon Burger.

Depending on the day and how packed it is - we will sit either in the bar (happy hour!) or the restaurant. I'm always one who is looking for a great value - and for the most part you get it at Red Robin - especially if you are a Red Robin Loyalty member (free to sign up). You always get your 10th burger free (purchase 9 in any number of visits and the 10th's free), you get a free birthday burger, and at various times during the year you get deals loaded on, I can't tell you how many times I had a free $10 loaded on my card or a free milkshake, etc... Of course you MUST have your card with you and hand it to your server so they can swipe it to get your deal.  That being said - they are always really accomodating with specializing any burger, they have multiple options from a wheat bun to a kaiers roll to making it all protein and having a lettuce bun! I LOVE that they added new dipping sauces for their fries, and of course the all you can eat unlimited fries are great. Not to mention the prices really just are reasonable. When we sit at the bar, we get our usual hamburgers, my husband gets a beer and i get an iced tea and we are usually out of there for less than $35. AND usually I'm taking home my burger since I ate only fries! On top of this - they have some great happy hour appetizers - their wedge salad is absolutely delicious - if my husband and I want to throw some healthy into our dinner we'll get the wedge - for $3 during happy hour, you can't beat it :) I gave 4 out of 5 stars only because sometimes the service can be poor when there are a lot of people there, even sitting at the bar sometimes we don't get refills for a WHILE until we ask.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roseville?start=120,3.56,3.56,3.56,2.7359999999999998,3.5600000000000005

Recently Feb 16th I just had to have one. Lunch crowd on a Sunday is busy to be sure but I knew that before entering. Actually our wait was not too bad and we were seated in about 20 min. The girl that seated us was pleasant and smiling. Our waitress came over after about 5 minutes and took our drink order (tea) and since we knew what we wanted we ordered then. After about 5 minutes my tea got there and I went to put some sweetener in it and there wasn't any on the table. The server was gone as fast as her legs could carry her so I thought I'll just wait till she gets back. After a good five minutes my wife noted that the table behind me left and they had some sweetener so I got up and got a couple packets. Still no server. Another 10 minutes no food our drinks are empty so I put our glasses at the edge of the table. Still no server. Finally I flag down someone (not our server) and have them refill our drinks. Meanwhile numerous employees including what I think was the manager walked by but no one could even see the empty glasses at  the edge of the table. Our food arrives and it is carried out by two girls not our server and set down. In fact our server comes back near the end of the meal and hands us a check. I asked her for another refill on the drinks and some of the never ending fries. She looks VERY put out refills my tea and says politely that she will get them as soon as they are ready. Last time we see her. So... after about 15 minutes (no fries) we leave and left her 1.86 tip (I didn't have change or it would have been zero).

We checked at 45 minutes and were told another 30, on sure it's a busy Saturday and after another 30 we were told that at 6 we should have been advices of a 1 and a half to 2 and a half hour wait!!!! WHAT!!! Then we were offered 2 booths to split our party that were ""close"" which turned out to be far enough apart we wouldn't have been able to interact at all. We saw a large party leaving and asked if we could have their table after it was cleaned off they said ""sure, it will be 10 minutes"" this was more than 10 minutes ago and we still haven't gotten our food.

She went on break or was off and Mikhaila (spelling?) took over and she was just as nice, very attentive and we wanted for nothing, I hope every waiter/waitress I encounter in the future at all eating establishments are like these two ladies.

We used to come here all the time when we lived in the area with my Husbands kids and now they have revised the menu and remodeled the location since the last time we came so it now looks very nice.  We came in at lunchtime around 11:30am so we were seated right away. Make sure to get there early if you're coming in on the weekend because there was a 20+ minute wait at 12:30pm when we left. I love how you can customize anything on their menu here and they always get it right. I usually get the Whiskey River BBQ Burger (sub Veggie Patty) but this time I decided on the Blue Ribbon Burger (sub Veggie Patty) with steak sauce, chipotle aioli, lettuce, blue cheese and onion straws on an onion bun. OMG it was SO GOOD. Much better than any burger I have had at one of the smaller ""fast casual"" burger chains. It had great flavor and was super unique and inventive. This is what I love about Red Robin! My Husband got their new Smoke and Pepper Burger which came with peppered bacon, sharp cheddar and peppered ketchup on a ciabatta bun. He was blown away with the peppered bacon and ketchup and was intent on devouring this amazing burger. Did I mention that all burgers come with unlimited fries which you can customize as well? Amazing! For around $10 a burger I think this isn't a bad value. We were stuffed when we left and remained so for the rest of the day. Service was quick and friendly and the restaurant was kept clean. I cannot say anything negative about this location because we have always had an enjoyable experience every time we come here with no complaints.

We got help from another server at least 3 times because our server was no where to be found and had forgotten things we asked for. She seemed to hate her job.

Is appeared that she was handling about 6 tables by herself and she seemed a little overwhelmed. Given that, she did a really good job handling our group of seven adults. We had six meals with bottomless fries and one bottomless root beer float. She gets five stars for sure!  Here is why I gave red robin two stars. The first batch of fries that came out tasted like they had been sitting for a while. They were very stale and not crispy anymore. We didn't say anything because we knew they would have to make fresh ones since there were 7 of us. I would like it if the fries came in more bulk especially since there were seven grown adults. The fries lasted about 30 seconds before we needed more. Unlike children, we knew when to cut ourselves off from them if we were getting full so none were wasted. I just seemed like a hassle for us and our server to keep bringing fries over and over in these little amounts.  What really set me off was the bathroom. The men's room looked like a war zone. The trash was overflowing and there were were multiple toilet seat covers jammed into the big stall. I attached pictures so you know I wasn't exaggerating. They have a sign on the door that says they try and keep it clean but there is no way an employee had stepped foot in there. The burgers were good so I will probably be back. Hopefully they are more well staffed and have all their housekeeping done.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roseville?start=120,2.84,3.28,3.28,2.408,3.104

103,Bryan L.,"Roseville, CA",5,281,,2.0,2015-02-14,"We didn't have to wait long to get a table but it was very crowded.  Unfortunately, we were stuck at a booth by the entrance to the service area and the kitchen but the booth was barely large enough to fit two people and the three of us were a bit cramped. I was practically hanging off the side of the seat.  This one busboy kept smacking me in the leg with dish bins and glass racks because he was carrying too many and not paying attention to where he was going.  A knife had fallen onto the floor by the kitchen door at some point and I wasn't going to say anything at first, but after seeing 7 people step on it and 4 more kick it around the floor, I was about to say something when someone else finally knocked it under the kitchen door. Not only was that a safety hazard, but these people weren't even paying attention to where they were walking. I really hope they threw that knife in the trash. About 10 minutes later a whole tray of knives fell on the floor and some people just stepped over them while others cleaned them up. I know it was busy, but you're seriously going to try and maneuver around people who are crouched down and handling cutlery?  We ordered an appetizer but it came out like a minute before our meals did so we mostly ate it afterwards (what's the point of calling it an appetizer if it comes out at the same time as the meal?) This happened the last time I was here too.  I had their ""gourmet"" Black&Bleu burger, which was good, but kind of small and a little pricey at $15. I didn't notice until after it arrived, but the waitress didn't ask me how I wanted it cooked. She didn't ask any of us for that matter. I think I'll stick to the Bleu Ribbon burger, which is my favorite.  I like the food here but the crowds and the occasionally inattentive staff sort of keep me away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roseville?start=120,2.84,3.23,3.23,2.44,3.074
196,Ginny Z.,"Roseville, CA",58,14,,1.0,2015-02-15,"You won't believe what was in the Chili....A finger nail!!!!""    It has taken me awhile to post my review for Red Robin because I was waiting to see how they would handle my customer survey.  This occurred in November 2014. One of the people in our party of 5 ordered a bowl of chili. While eating it he got a strange look on his face and pulled a ripped off finger nail out of his mouth. It was in the chili. They offered to get him something else which he declined. I received a phone call from the store manager in late November asking what had happened. I explained. He was shocked. He said that he would look into it and get back to me the following week. It has been over 2-1/2 months and I haven't heard anything from them.  The manager indicated that it could have happened at the plant that makes the chili mix for them or it could have happened in his restaurant. He would try to figure it out. I haven't heard anything from them. I chose not to review them to see what they would do. I imagine that the health department would have something to say about this.  My issue is their lack of concern. No follow up or call back.  Their service has bottomed out. I don't know where the problem is. The serving staff or the kitchen. The food takes forever. The endless fries aren't endless. Two half-baskets of fries for 8 isn't sufficient. Ten fries doesn't make a basket. It is necessary to re-order. When you ask for a specific sauce it doesn't show up. Beverages are refilled if you ask for more. Sometimes you have to ask twice. Their rule used to be that when the beverage gets below the logo on the glass it is to be refilled. We have gone to this restaurant since it first opened. We have become friends and continue to stay in touch with some of their servers. They have moved on. Getting a table at Red Robin used to be really difficult. When we eat as a family there are 9 of us. Now it's not all that difficult to get a table for 9.  It seems that their business has fallen off. Even with the reduction of patrons, it takes forever to get your food. Things happen. A finger nail in the food???? Whoever the finger nail belonged to had to have know that it ripped off. It was a thumb nail. Disgusting. Worse is the restaurants lack of customer service regarding the issue. Used to be our favorite place. Not any more. GinnyZ",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roseville?start=160,2.8,3.2,3.2,2.34,3.0400000000000005
195,Jared W.,"Sacramento, CA",1,7,,1.0,2015-02-16,"My girlfriend and I went to this location of Red Robin on Valentines Day and arrived at 5:40 pm that evening. They had a 20-30 minute wait, which is understandable. We put our names on the waiting list and walked around the parking lot. We came back at 6:20 pm and the host Austin informed us that their system ""glitches"" sometimes and doesn't send a text to us. He was nice about this error, and got us a table in about 5 minutes. We were seated near the bar area, and had a server named Rachael. She seemed annoyed to be serving us pretty much immediately and we ordered drinks. She came back with our drinks and we ordered our food. We got the appetizer and about 5 minutes later we got our entree, which isn't enough time to eat the food. I ordered a ""Bacon Cheeseburger"" but I wanted to add the bleu cheese crumbles on the burger. She never mentioned an increase for the change, but it was on the bill. I asked for no pink on the burger, it came dry in a bad way and definitely no pink. I ate the burger and wasn't pleased spending $12 for a burger I didn't enjoy. My girlfriend ordered the ""Garden Burger"" and she added avocado which wasn't informed again about the extra charge. The patty was dry also and the edges were dry and hardened and difficult to put the knife through the edges. The patty seemed like it was microwaved, not grilled as I would expect it to be. The food was definitely below par for paying $40 for 2 people to have one appetizer and two burgers. The service from the waitress was rushed (after 15 minutes she asked us if we were just taking a break or if we were done because we stopped eating for a minute to talk). She got the drink order wrong for my girlfriend, no grenadine in the drink, and it came with grenadine. The service was rude, inconsiderate, and she just seemed like she wanted her shift to end or wanted us to leave so she could move on to the next table. I don't understand why your restaurant is employing people like this, but I feel this is not appropriate for a restaurant that has increased the price of their burgers quite a bit in the last 10 years, but not increased the quality or the service. I will not be going to Red Robin anymore, and I loved it in the past. I don't normally leave this low reviews for anywhere, but I feel this is appropriate for this restaurant as they seemed to have made mistakes during my entire visit to their location.

Reminded me a bit of Cheesecake factory, their updated menu. Several new 'gourmet' burgers on focaccia bread, with blue cheese, bacon, etc. Stick to what you do well. Middle of the road burgers that are well executed. Don't raise your prices to compete with the bigger chains. Your burgers are simple and tasty. The bottomless fries are a treat. Love the sweet potato fries. Crispy, tasty.  Cleanliness could improve a bit, but overall a really good burger. A bit expensive for $10+, but guess that's the average now. Guess I'm getting old, or cheap, or both. But, it does come with fries, so that's a good thing. Don't appreciate them nickel and diming if you want garlic fries or sweet potato fries (think it's $1.50 more). Oh well, it was worth it.  Simple, casual fare.

From reading other recent reviews this has been the experience of others as well. The fries that accompany your burger have been proportioned down to a less than small order dropped into the equivalent of a napkin ring (probably a third of what you used to get with your burger). Okay, fine...if the server is going to keep them coming. My less than small order of fries, however, were in need of a refill after just a few minutes but even after being promised more they didn't materialize. I finished my burger, my iced tea went dry, and even after a long wait to get a drink refill, still no fries. There was a great exodus from Ireland as a result of the potato famine...Red Robin, learn from that experience...just sayin'. My single refill of bottomless fries finally arrived about an hour after being seated when my server dropped off the check and I was beyond ready to escape the potato famine. Something Good:  One of my fave burgers anywhere is the Royal Red Robin. All the components of this burger meld perfectly for a wonderful burgerlicious experience.  When that warm egg yoke breaks and coats the burger it adds an extra creamy dimension to the burger...for those of you that have not experienced it keep an open mind and give it a try! Yes, it's messy so keep plenty if napkins close by. Why two stars? Burgers go with fries like Batman goes with Robin. In this case, the fries (Robin) were hiding in the kitchen.

123,Jeff C.,"Roseville, CA",6,99,55.0,1.0,2015-07-28,"I've been a big fan of Red Robin for over a decade. This is a place I visited at least once a week. The service and food was always excellent. At one point they removed my favorite item from the menu but after lobbying HQ for months, it finally got it put back on the menu. After the unfortunate fire the restaurant was closed for a while and remodeled before opening again.  I have no idea what happened. They blocked off the front entry from the lobby of the front of the store.  They put up wooden shutters, yes, wooden shutters. I've never heard of that before, and now I know why. Everything is closed off.  Once seated you had glass dividers between you and everyone else. I felt like I was in a cubicle.  The sound is weird and you feel closed off to everything including the staff but what happens next kind of explains why staff doesn't want to be around, on the floor.  What used to be a training site corporate used has turned into a sad place to eat.  The staff used to be so friendly and upbeat.  Now they seem like it's a chore to wait on customers. I think it probably has to do with some ""new"" policies put in place by some bean counter.  Everytime we ate there previously, we were always greeted as soon as we sat down. After ordering drinks we could get french fries before the food arrived.  That no longer exists.  When we asked for ranch dressing for the fries, it usually took 2 or 3 tries to get some to show up at the table.  Refills on drinks used to be automatic.  There never was a wait for refills before these apparant changes but again, we'd put our empty glasses at the edge of the table and either some busser would try and take them or we would wait 5-10 minutes before we saw someone who looked familiar who would refill our drinks. Something must have changed at the management or corporate level.  I was utterly shocked at how different this place was.  I was warned repeatedly by my friend beforehand that he experienced such bad service. I thought he was crazy or just too demanding but I'm a pretty easy going guy and a huge fan of RR but man, he was right. And  so disappointed.  This was my go to place. I went there for so many of my birthdays to celebrate with family and friends but I'll be sadly finding a new place to eat.  I'm really in shock as to why anyone would mess with such a good thing.  The TGI Fridays across the street went out of business twice in the past decade and I wouldn't be surprised at all if Red Robin is closed as well in the next year or so. They really went out of their way to change this place for the worse.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roseville?start=140,2.84,3.0,3.0,2.34,2.9360000000000004

Soda is priced like well-drinks...even kids soda was overpriced.   I had three straight terrible dinners here (just to see if it was accidental)....and each time I felt I spent a full workday just to eat dinner...kids were tired...and what happened to TABLE SETTINGS with UTENSILS???? should i need to ask for it everytime.... so sad...my kids grew up coming in to see the red robin bird costume character made them feel so comfortable now they seemed to go away from that...into something else.... so long red robin!  You changed for the worse",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roseville?start=200,2.52,2.91,2.91,2.248,2.7540000000000004

145,Susan S.,"Rocklin, CA",0,14,,1.0,2016-04-26,"Oh, Dirty Bird, as I used to affectionately call you when I went there all the time for your onion strings and assorted burgers and salads.  What has happened to you?  You have completely lost your mojo. At this Roseville location especially.  I have even given you more than one chance to prove to me that you still have what it takes.  You were very late getting my meal to the table?  OK, at least it came eventually.  Got my order wrong?  Ooooh, one of the staff gets a free burger because of that wrong order!  At least the service was good, right?  Nope.  Not even close.  I was there last Friday before the rush hour with my offspring and husband.  We ordered, our server was the usual jovial RR type, and all seemed well.  Cut to the fact that we (the adults) never got our food.  The kids meals (which, let's be honest, are the easiest ones to prep seeing as they come from a fryer and a large vat of premade mac n cheese) arrived and the kids ate as we nursed our watered down margs.  The kids were long finished with their meals and still....no food for the adults.  And no real concern that our table was lacking adult meals.  When we asked the jovial RR server, he explained that the kitchen was just really busy (but come on jovial RR dude, we got seated right away and it wasn't peak dinner rush time, so, that).  He offered us some fries, finally, but we didn't want fries, we wanted our salads with the dressing on the side because healthy.  More time went by and still, no food.  We finally told jovial RR server to please bring us our check, and asked to have the manager bring it so that we could speak with them and explain why we were leaving unsatisfied.  Mind you, we are polite professionals so we weren't going to make a scene or get confrontational with the manager; we really just wanted someone to know what our experience was.  So the manager brought us our check and seemed annoyed that we were not happy to have waited so long for our food.  She came out defensive of the server (which, I get it, have your staff's back but at least please listen to the customer's concerns), offered our super late meals to go and a small discount (note discount - not comp) of our meals.  We were over it by then and politely declined the adult meals to go.  We ended up paying over $30 for corn dogs, mac n cheese, and two margaritas with a questionable amount of booze in them.  In sum, here's the deal - things happen and errors are made.  No biggie. Just apologize and make it right.   I don't expect white glove service at a place where they clap ""Happy Happy Birthday"" to you on your big day, but I would expect, especially for management that was trained by a corporation in how to respond to a complaint in the best way possible to ensure guest retention and satisfaction, that the situation would have been remedied accordingly.  That did not happen at all.  We will never eat there again.  And it won't matter to you, Dirty Bird,  because there will always be big groups and teenagers and families that need a loud place to eat, but we will not be among them.  There was love lost last Friday, Dirty Bird.  Love lost.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roseville?start=180,2.56,2.83,2.83,2.148,2.7220000000000004
48,Steph G.,"Sacramento, CA",561,790,1237.0,3.0,2016-05-04,"Half machine, half human. Post Bridesmaid dress shopping, we were all ravenous. We didn't have too long of a wait, but they had plenty of seating for those that did. We were showed to a large booth in the corner. Bless our Server's heart. You know when you stick your foot in our mouth and you cannot recover, yeah, that happened to him! He asked what our big group was doing there and we told him that we just finished shopping for dresses. He proceeded to say, which we know he meant to compliment ""All the pretty girls are married."" Mind you, half of us aren't married. So then we gave him a hard time from then on. All in jest, but you could tell he felt bad. This doesn't pertain to the food, but as a reminder that we're all human. So, there's a machine at your table where you can order food. So, there's a human that comes to your table and you can order food from him too. It's really weird. Do I tip my normal 20% when the server isn't even doing the work?  I do not particularly care for this chain, but when the Bride picks it, you go. It's not bad, but its nothing special. I'd rather eat somewhere that isn't a chain, especially this one. The burger options are great, but their 'endless' fries never come out crispy when I order them as such. Since they are made on a continual, mass basis...I never get crispy ones. Someone ordered a few appetizers which we all shared - Guac, Salsa, and chips and towering onion rings. They definitely killed the hangry in the group, but they again were just average. Good enough to eat happily, but nothing to brag about. I kept it simple and ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger with regular fries, washed it all down with a Pina Colada. If I know anything, I know these chain restaurants are killer at making these silly drinks...and it was HOT outside so it sounded perfect! The burger was decent, nothing to write home about, but also nothing to complain about. Just an average executed burger. Again, the fries were just like everyone elses, not as crispy as I would have liked. Our server did hook us up, I think as redemption from his comment earlier. He just kept bringing fries, until we told him we'd puke if he brought more. Some of the girls ordered sweet potato and garlic fries, so he brought copious amounts of those too. He was also never short of Ranch for the table. I do know one issue was that he said it was happy hour, but the beers the bride ordered weren't on HH and we didn't realize this until it was time to pay. He should have mentioned that to her when she ordered them. Maybe an oversight or maybe just trying to keep the tab higher, we're unsure. When it was time to pay the machine came in handy. We were able to select our items and pay for just them. With a group of 8 women, that is perfect. It also lets you select any amount of tip as well. I remember there being one screen many of us kept getting stuck on, but I can't remember what it was. It even printed out a receipt for you too. Fancy little gadget, I tell you.

Then what appeared to be the manager brought us fries. But basically dropped then off and left. No offer for sauce or anything. Fine, she busy be busy.

My wife repeated the order and had it repeated to her. Salad chicken strips and a burger protein style (no bun wrapped in lettuce) with bacon and avocado, onion and tomatoes. Arrived at 9 to pick it up waited and additional 10 minutes.  Got it home to fine a burger patty with bacon and avocado none of the other requests not even the dressing were as ordered.  920 called the restaurant to complain and were told they would fix it right away and to come back over. 2 mile drive so not so bad. Got back to restaurant the gent at the front desk immediately knew why i was there and called the manager. Several minutes later he arrived and repeated the order back to mess offering to make it again as apparently they hadn't started already as promised.  Cut to 945. Still waiting for food. The gentleman at the front desk chased the food down for me. Sadly it was still wrong but as I had a very hungry crew at home I could wait no longer and had to take it home as is. The whole journey cost me a hour of my life. Extremely disappointed that no one checked the order before handing it to me. Even more disappointed the manager had no urgency in fixing my order and never checked back to see if it was fixed. Where is the pride in food operations and the service of the restaurant.  Sorry red robin you lost me. I will have to find another place for late night grub as obviously customer service. Is not paramount to the operation considering I have to pay at a terminal and the staff can't be bothered to take my money anymore.

136,David G.,"San Jose, CA",0,9,8.0,2.0,2016-12-03,The quality of food here is hardly ever the problem. Food is usually hot and fresh (when they get your order right). The service is really the main problem here at this location. I've eaten here at several different times of day. I have had maybe 2 or 3 servers in total out of the dozens of times I've been here who were attentive and paid attention. Majority of the servers don't bother to check if drink refills are needed. I recently had an issue where they messed up 1 of 5 dished that were ordered. The server took the dish to get the right one but then didn't come back. I waited about 20 minutes before going to ask someone when the dish was coming out. When the person who was not my server brought the burger it was barely warm. The person who brought it out didn't apologize and acted as if there was nothing wrong with the burger being 20min later than all of the other food I ordered. It's as if it had just been sitting there in the back for a while. I also had to go to the front of the restaurant because there weren't any employees in the dinning area. I honestly don't know where these employees go when paying customers should be attended to. I mean cmon...customers do tip and they usually can only do that when your around to serve. I also didn't appreciate the greeter in the front who tried very hard to convince us that it was going to be complicated to seat 5 people. It was as if she was trying to get us to go away. In all honesty I can't figure out why the service I get is usually so poor. I can't say it's because they are busy because sometimes the restaurant is not even half full or maybe it's not even half empty? Perhaps it's just the servers who are not very well trained or just doesn't care? Maybe the servers just have trouble taking care of more than 2 people at a table? In any case don't come expecting much in the way of service as your likely not going to get much of it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roseville?start=140,2.88,2.71,3.096,2.408,2.7779999999999996

13,John H.,"Salado, TX",433,487,2057.0,2.0,2017-01-26,"I'm simply not a fan - of this or any other Red Robin location.  I can find a much better burger joint within blocks of most large chain burger joints. No localization and no individuality.  Red Robin isn't very interesting.  'Gourmet' is a stretch. Always crowded, always noisy, always a long wait for food.  For an average burger, its not worth it.  I go when others choose it as the place to be. They do turn tables quickly so the wait to be seated isn't so bad.  A recent lunch whistle brought a few family members together for lunch as some were passing through town; six of us and a young'en.  A fine job done catering to the youngest of youts, ours and of others about the place.  It's good for families and meh for 'gourmet' burgers. The menus were incomplete, missing pages.  Utensils for three were brought to our booth of six.  I don't know.  I could go on.  These simple 'things' go overlooked and make a big statement.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roseville?start=20,2.92,2.73,3.096,2.216,2.806

This location however, is AWFUL. The staff is horrible and that's why I'm rating a one star. They're slow, forgetful, and not very friendly. For example, last time I visited this location, we sat at our table for 20 minutes before our waitress even greeted us and took our drink order. I wish I had gotten her name because she was the worst. No apology and it wasn't even busy so im not sure what the big hold up was. I think a manager must've noticed because he came over and apologized for the wait and made sure we got our order in and food as quickly as possible. We tipped the busser because he was doing ten times more work than that waitress.

126,Jenna W.,"Elk Grove, CA",1,7,3.0,2.0,2017-03-04,"I have always been a fan of Red Robin but I do not plan on coming back to this location. Our experience was pretty negative from the beginning. We were a small party and were told the wait was going to be 10-15 minutes. The whole time we were waiting the little girls who were hostesses were just hanging out. When one of us went up to politely ask how much longer the wait would be since it had been 25 minutes it was a major inconvenience to them. After that all we received from them was an alarming amount of attitude, I'm sure they are still under 18 but they do need to learn how to treat customers. A few minutes later one of them apparently called our name (I think her name was Kendra), it was extremely loud in there and she said it quietly. Since we did not hear her she said it much louder with SO MUCH attitude, we all looked at each other amazed. She continued the attitude while taking us to our table even when asked how her day was going. We waited about ten minutes for someone to approach us at our table. Natalie was our waitress and she was the saving grace of the whole night. Natalie was not supposed to be our waitress but she noticed us sitting without food or drinks and was more than happy to help. She was so friendly and helpful it really made up for the other girl.  When we left the hostesses screamed to have a good night and laughed with each other quietly. It felt oddly like high school. When all was said and done two out of the three from our party ended up sick at home throwing up.  Safe to say this was not quite the relaxing dinner with friends we hoped for.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roseville?start=140,2.84,2.65,3.06,2.472,2.726

35,Megan D.,"Sacramento, CA",322,128,455.0,3.0,2017-05-08,"This was the first time I've ever been to this red Robin in Roseville. I am kind of torn between doing three stars or four stars I wish there was the option of doing a 3 1/2 stars. But oh well, I guess I feel it would be more of a three if I had to choose. The reason I did this is because first of all the food was really good but our server was mediocre - Eh..  Let's start off with the area; it's right across the street from the big mall in Roseville. The neighborhood is very nice. Parking could be hard to find when you pull into the lot. Red Robin shares the  parking lot with other restaurants around it.  As we got sat down to our table our waitress approaches us and asks what kind of drinks we want. Everything is normal and going well until I ask her about their bottomless ""wedges"". for some reason I thought Red Robin had wedges not fries. I haven't been here in a long time so, I had forgotten. and she immideatly said ""what???? What are you talking about???"" And I said it again, ""it's bottomless wedges?"" She's like ""what??? We don't sell wedges. What are you taking about."" Like oh. My. God. Why was she speaking to me in that way. Her tone and her attitude.. all I have to say to that is EWW! She's apparently not wanting to get a tip or something. so I just responded back to okay. afraid if I responded in a harsh way back she might spit into my food. Throughout the rest of the night her serving skills was whatever. I was already kind of pissed about her attitude so I wasn't going to give her another chance.  on to the food: the food was good! I wouldn't say it was the best burger I've ever had but it was yummy! I wouldn't say it was great either. One thing you could choose for your burger was either: little pink or no pink for the meat. My boyfriend and I both choose little pink. luckily, yes it was a little pink. I wish we could have customized it to how we wanted it. preferably I like it as medium rare but it's okay, close enough.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roseville,2.96,2.75,3.06,2.316,2.8339999999999996

They were out of chicken fingers for my kid (after he took the order), food took 45 min to arrive. Had to ask for place settings. My prime rib dip was cold and soggy.

Finally, when asked for separate checks, we were told ""you can do it on the robin"" a table top kiosk. Of course, it didn't work. What did work was the kiosk recommending a 20% tip. Really?

30,Lance S.,"Roseville, CA",36,137,59.0,1.0,2017-10-15,"This might be one of the hardest reviews that I have had to write. Just a reminder this review will be based on eating here on a Saturday night with a group of about 14 people. It all started off pretty good we had a table in about 20 minuets and that was pretty awesome. They even gave us French fries before they took our drink order. You could tell the server was going to be overwhelmed which was a bummer since we really like Red Robin. After about 10 to 15 minuets they took our drink order and the. Another 10 to 15 minuets the sodas finally started to come out. So about this time it was about 30 to 40 minuets from sitting down and they decided to finally take our order. This took about 10 minuets which I understand you want to make sure everything is correct..... So after about another 30 minuets they started to bring out food and you could tell my family members were not impressed as a lot of it was barely warm, but at this point they were hungry and just wanted to eat. This is when my wife and I finally received our food, we were the last but hey that's okay. Well that was until we both had our first bites.... her burger was medium rare and mine was a bit more cooked but still very red for a burger. Yes that ask some pink or no pink, we both asked for no pink burgers. I was so bummed out on how our burgers were still mooing I mean come on, I understand you are in Roseville on a Saturday so you will always have business, but get it together.  The manager took our food off the bill, which is the correct thing to do since we did not eat them and had to leave to feed our 7 week old baby since dinner was already at 2 hours.  So if you are coming her as a party take this into account.  Hopefully someone at Red Robin can help train this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roseville,2.44,2.68,2.94,1.5720000000000003,2.584

He looked confused and walked away with it.   We told our server we were fat and wanted a lot of camp fire sauce and we were handed 2 small half full sauces. When we asked for more, we were given one bigger one half full.  We had to order more from the manager since we weren't getting enough from Racheal.

37,Emily G.,"Elk Grove, CA",1,30,16.0,1.0,2017-10-18,"Dad was hungry and he wanted a burger, we were in the neighborhood so I figured, why not. I can't remember the last time I craved a burger, but I do enjoy a chiliburger and RR has a decent one. Now, In most RR I have been to, you can't even get to the door before someone is there, opening it for you and welcoming you to the restaurant. And though the host did greet us when we came in, it was only later that it struck me as odd that this RR didn't do that. In all honesty, that wasn't a big deal. And so, about 3:00 on a Wednesday afternoon, Dad and I are seated in the main dining room and all but a few tables have stacks of dishes on them from what I assume was the end of the lunch rush. I can appreciate that servers who have been working their tales off getting people seated, watered, fed, and cleared for the next cover will need a minute to breathe before clearing away the dirty dishes and cleaning the tables before they had to worry about the dinner rush, but it seemed odd to me that no one came to do it.  I sat down, perused the menu whilst Dad left to use the facilities. He would later report that it was filthy. That's not really acceptable either.  But, as he is not exactly a spry man and requires a walker, it took him about ten minutes, maybe a bit more, to conclude his business and return to the table. In all that time no one had come to the table to ask about drinks.  I am a very forgiving person and when the waiter did come I asked him if they were short staffed. He looked at me as if that were a very bizarre question and asked me what makes me say that. I demurred and mentioned that there didn't seem to be much staff. In all fairness I saw two servers and the host. I thought that it was a logical assumption seeing as the tables had still not been touched. Perhaps this is why we were not offered a table or booth when we had entered. And so we order. Dad and I both got Diet Cokes. He ordered the Southern Charm burger, pink with no mayo no onion. I order the Chili Burger, no pink, no mayo. We get our drinks, fries, and, eventually our meal. I was, in all honesty, displeased with the chili. It looked as if it had been sitting in the warmer and had developed a crust. At least it had cheese. The burger looked as if it had been purposefully charred. Just because I don't want it mooing doesn't mean I want to eat charcoal either. Three minutes on each side of those flat, pre-packed burgers is more than enough time to cook it no pink without turning it black.  And that's when I realize that we were not given knives. Fine, I can cut this with my fork, but it's a little annoying. On the third bite I realize that I'm tasting the chipotle mayo. I don't like mayo, which is why I ordered it with no mayo. Besides, mayo with chili? Honestly? That's just gross.  I peel apart my burger and there's the mayo. I was done. I was just done. We weren't even offered a dessert menu, I guess the waiter picked up on my displeasure. But then, I did leave most of my burger there, and I didn't ask for a box. Even if I don't eat it all, I usually ask for a box to take it home to my dog. She loves my leftovers. From the time we came to the time we left was about an hour and in all that time, not a single table was cleared. If I wanted to eat a burned burger in those surroundings, I could have just cooked at home. So I was not impressed with this restaurant. I have never had bad service, or a subpar meal in any other RR and if this were my first experience with this franchise, I wouldn't go back to another one. 10/10 won't ever come back to this restaurant... even if I did live in the neighborhood.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roseville,2.4,2.64,2.924,1.7000000000000002,2.544

I come to Red Robin all the time with friends and family and have never had anything bad to say until tonight. From the moment I sat down it was horrible, I needed an extra chair for my party and had asked a bus boy and as he asked our soon to be waitress named LINZEE(yes spelled like that), she yelled ""absolutely not"" while walking the other direction. I was automatically taken off guard from the beginning. After waiting 15 minutes for her to finally get around to us she took our drink orders, and began walking away as we were still speaking to her she made everyone in my group feel uncomfortable from the start. When we finally got our garlic fries there was nothing on them so I asked for the toppings on the side and she replied with ""the kitchen is very busy I'm lucky I got fries"" again as she was walking away. She brought the toppings 20 mins after we asked, not even needing it anymore. As most people know the fries are bottomless and we were constantly having to ask for a refill due to the fact that there are only 6 fries if your lucky in a basket and having to wait 20 minuets each time while enduring her unprofessional rude remarks. Whenever we asked her for something it was always an ""I'll try"" or something I couldn't understand as she walked away while speaking. I spoke to the manager at the end, and got a non-apologetic response claiming he would speak to her and that she might be having a bad day, I'm sorry but I have worked in the restaurant industry as well and always leave my attitude at the door.

However, I was sitting in a position where I could see her behind the host stand and she would NOT stop checking her phone. The time that I was sitting there she probably checked it 15 times. On top of it she kept talking very loudly about inappropriate topics for work and kept cussing way too loud. The other hosts hushed her several times and she would just laugh if off. Also the other hosts kept yelling at her to do her job because you could tell she was slowing them down by not helping at all. The young gentlemen named Livv was very apologetic when I brought it to his attention and was very friendly. Our server Chase was very friendly and attentive. The food was good per usual.

This location USED to be pretty great, but recently I've been less than impressed. Red Robin Galleria has seen some shift, let me tell you. My high school friend was here the night it partially burned down, and thankfully evacuation was efficient. I feel that it has never been the same since. Call me dramatic. 2 recent events caused me to drop this location from a solid 4 (in my mind, apparently I've only written tips at this location?). A group of my OG pallies came in here to celebrate the birthday of one of our number last week....AND: 1. What on EARTH happened to the House Salad? It used to be a thing of crunchy, fresh beauty! What arrived on my plate was a wilted, boring, sad shell of what the Red Robin House Salad once was. SAD! It was once a most beloved pile of lively, ripe greens and veggies, crunchy strip thingies (nowhere to be found any longer), with many bright colors and happy magic sprinkled everywhere. What I got had maybe tomatoes, cukes, and looked like it came from a bag. Ew.  2. Yes, that Dr. Pepper WAS flat. Fix your soda machine. Dr. P is gross as it is, don't cause the increased suffering of its biggest fan by serving ick soda. And please, don't make the customer think you don't believe her when she complains. She did appreciate her free shake, but some customer service tips would benefit the server we had. Yes, we'll fix that, none of this well I checked it and it looks normal bs. No, no, no. Bad bad bad. Service was right in the middle between slow and speedy, and they started us out with a basket of bottomless fries right off the bat. That tells me they've heard the complaints several reviewers have shared, and are trying to improve. We were also blessed with a random gift of sweet potato fries, but it was not clear if this was a mistake or a gift? Thanks! My salad sucked, and my soda was not flat, but getting there with the quickness. No one else had any food issues. I'm not sure if I'll be back at this location unless family beckons. This is a favorite dinner destination of my parents, and since this is usually the reason I come here, perhaps whether I'll be back is not in my hands? Parking Note: Hideous.

I knock RR management for that. Servers should only have 4 tables, not 8.   Unto the food!  I usually get my standby mushroom burger but the picture of the mad love burger really appealed to me. OMG!  It was was the BEST burger I ever had.  Hubs tried it and said ""Oh yeah you can tell just by the first bite how good it is"" It had all this ooey gooey cheese and then a layer of crisp cheese, marinated tomatoes, fresh avocado on a soft ciabatta bun.  It was worth the 998 calories.  I hope they keep this one on the menu.

We eat at Red Robin in other locations regularly as it is a restaurant that is known to have good food allergy policies. My 6 year old daughter has multiple life threatening food allergies and Red Robin is one of the few places we trust to eat out and we were out of town for the holidays. We told the waiter about my daughter's allergies and asked him to give the chef our laminated prepared card explaining them, but told him as we eat there regularly we knew that what we ordered for her was safe. Macaroni and cheese and apples. Very simple. Everyone else asked that their burgers had buns without sesame seeds due to her allergies, there are several bun options. An  hour after ordering our waiter came back to the table to tell us our order would be out soon ""they are just trying to get all that allergy stuff right."" It was a Tuesday night and other people who came in after us were already done eating. Mind you we now have three kids, 7 and under crying because they are hungry. The waiter came back 20 minutes later with food other than what I had ordered for my daughter slammed it down and said ""well it has the allergy sticks in it so are you going to be ok with it?"" Mind you her allergens were on the plate. Every order had sesame buns and there were sesame seeds on plates that didn't even have buns. Half the orders, just regular orders, weren't what was ordered. He said he would be right back and with the correct food. We spoke to the manager who looked like an overwhelmed 12 year old who tried to tell us it sounded like a miss communication as the waiter said it wasn't actually a sesame allergy. I explained the card I had given him and all that occurred. Ten minutes later the waiter comes back and says ""in 20 years of doing this I have never dealt with something like this. You are going to have to deal with someone else."" AND he walked out of the restaurant WITH our chef card. Then no one came to talk to us until we stopped a very helpful staff member who attempted to straighten everything out, apologized profusely, told us we didn't have to pay for the food we had received and attempted to track down the card which became apparent was gone.

We tried another establishment and the wait was 1 hour and 15 minutes. Ya, not waiting for that. On the other hand Red Robin only had a 15 minute wait. Works for me, along with the bottomless fries!  While we were waiting my nephew needed a diaper changed. My brother and I went to go change his diaper in the men's restroom. This place had a changing station in the men's restroom! While this isn't the most impressive thing regarding this establishment, it is a plus. I have heard of men's restaurants and other establishments that aren't courteous to fathers.   Onto being sat. We waited a while for our server, Javan. It seemed like he was busy. Running around and taking care of multiple tables. He was very polite and genuinely nice. He gave us a heads up that he would be right with us and then eventually apologized for taking so long. By that time we were ready to order. We each ordered our respective burgers and drinks. My brother and I ordered the Guinness milkshake. It was really good the first round. You could barely taste any alcohol. The second round wasn't as good but you could take more of the Guinness.  Javan was somewhat on the slower side, but I'll give him credit for trying. It was also a Saturday night. Can't expect the best service on one of the busiest nights of the week. We wanted fries as our appetizer, he forgot to give it to us and we ended up receiving our meals. When it comes to Red Robin you don't really eat your burger. Take a few bites but load up on the fries. Since its bottomless fill up on the fries, take the burger to go and heat it up when you get home. Fries don't microwave well; on the other hand, my burger tasted just fine. Otherwise Javan was great, really nice guy. We ordered our second round of of fries and it came promptly. We eventually asked for the bills and boxed and paid soon thereafter. The host opened the door for us when he saw that we had a stroller. Very polite. Overall I would come back here. The restaurant was slower than other places. Endless fries, yes sir!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roseville,1.92,2.58,2.768,,2.316
29,Joe S.,"Rocklin, CA",483,201,125.0,1.0,2018-01-13,"I've tried 3 different locations (Citrus Height, Vacaville and Roseville) and all were the same level of awful. We had a short wait only about 10 minutes. The wait staff couldn't seem to decide who should wait on us so after about 15 more minutes we were taken care of by a guy who said he wasn't our waiter but could get us started on drinks and fries. The drinks came but alas...no fries. They didn't make an appearance for another 20 minutes and there were maybe 10 fries on the plate. Our waitress (who had the personality of a banana slug) finally brought our meals. They were ok...I had the Royal Robin and my wife the Southern Charm. I expect much more from a chain that only does burgers but yet again I was underwhelmed. The whole time we had our meals no one came to check on us to see if we needed anything. Finally a different waitress came over and said our waitress was too busy to check on us so she would instead. Our waitress had maybe 4 or 5 tables and clearly had no sense of urgency about her. After we were done she finally came over to see if we wanted more fries. Since I couldn't afford to wait another 20 minutes for 10 more fries we decided to go. Bottom line...the service is and has always been awful and the bottomless fries are a joke. Don't waste your time on this dump...I don't know how they have been in business for this long.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roseville,1.84,2.54,2.756,,2.2600000000000002
27,Michelle M.,"Sacramento, CA",0,23,1.0,1.0,2018-01-13,"This chain has gone downhill big time over the years. We really used to like the food but it is getting to the point that we don't ever want to eat here again. Our orders are always wrong or they forget to put items in our take out bag. Last night we ordered food at 10 pm, which I get is late but RR closed at 11, so still have an hour and the place wasn't busy at all. The food was cold and nasty and not to mention nobody even acknowledged us for a while. The management needs to pull it together. The location in Vacaville is the best one around and doesn't even compare to the locations around Sacramento.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roseville,1.84,2.54,2.748,,2.2600000000000002
20,Joseph A.,"Citrus Heights, CA",201,24,1.0,5.0,2018-01-13,"I love the great food here, the environment, and the service. My wife and I go here at least once or twice a month either in a date or going out with friends. Not only is the food great but I have never once had an order wrong. Plus if you're looking for a place to order on line and take home this is the best resturants for that.  We have done it numerous times and our orders are always done with excellence and it's made fresh and fast. Love this place and it will continue to be the one place that we go to a few times a month. Plus the bottom less fries are the best.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-roseville,2.0,2.54,2.756,,2.324
