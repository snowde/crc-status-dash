28,June S.,"Saint Cloud, MN",0,1,,5.0,2016-01-14,Great food & excellent service! I had the Royal Red Robin Burger & sweet potato fries and they were excellent. My group shared the Mountain High Mudd Pie for dessert & it was delicious! They have a great menu with a lot of variety that is sure to please anyone. This would be a good restaurant for families or adults. The food is very affordable & reasonable. I will definitely be going back:),https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-saint-cloud?start=20,3.0280000000000005,3.0280000000000005,3.0280000000000005,3.0280000000000005,3.0280000000000005
11,John L.,"St Cloud, MN",29,71,30.0,5.0,2016-01-18,"Stopped by yesterday, Sunday, at 11AM because sign on door said they open at that time. They did not open all day! We were very disappointed because I had promised my autistic son that we would finally get to try Red Robin in St Cloud. But today we stopped by for my wife's birthday which is tomorrow. They said we had to somehow register to get a free birthday burger giving them 24 hour advance notice... sounded a little fishy to us. But we signed up for their loyalty program, on their electronic device.  Food was excellent. The bottomless fries and bottomless cole slaw and burgers... EVERYTHING was really excellent. And our server Caleb, could not have been nicer or more  efficient, and helpful. We finally have a Quick Casual with full beer wine and liquor license that we can enjoy in St Cloud. Our tummies are full! Best burgers in town now!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-saint-cloud,2.9960000000000004,2.9960000000000004,2.9960000000000004,2.9960000000000004,2.9960000000000004
26,Anthony S.,"Fargo, ND",0,5,1.0,4.0,2016-01-24,"I found it amusing that the place had a hour wait for a table. It's Red Robin I thought, but I guess I'm from a town where a new place like this is no biggie. Even though it was totally full, our food was out in excellent time and just how we ordered them. Sadly our mixed drinks tasted boozeless. Staff was very nice, but a lot of them were trainers, so I guess I can't judge the staff until it's the people who will be there permanently. Good dining experience overall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-saint-cloud?start=20,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000007

9,Michelle K.,"Eden Valley, MN",267,215,40.0,4.0,2016-03-28,"We went here for lunch today and I was quite impressed. I came here with my family but think it would be a great place for drinks with friends as well! I had the pig out burger which was amazingly yummy and sweet potato fries! My son had the cheeseburger and fries and my daughter had the grilled chicken pieces on skewers and mixed fruit. My hubby had the salt and pepper burger and fries. I was highly impressed with the food and I think the portions were perfect! And if you are still hungry well all the sides are all you can eat! Best part is you never have to wait for your tab. There is a kiosk at your table to order drinks, apps, deserts and pay your bill!! Brilliant!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-saint-cloud,,,,,
17,Andrew B.,"Saint Cloud, MN",0,23,2.0,5.0,2016-04-06,My wife was excited to go back and try the Pig Out burger with bacon and bacon aoli. I got the Big Pig Out this time. It was well worth the extra dollar or two. More bacon as well as the addition of tomatoes and onions really made it pop! Very busy on a Friday night but the service was terrific!

4,Tim D.,"St Joseph, MN",90,626,1672.0,4.0,2016-07-17,"While I've been to Red Robin before, this was my first visit to this location. We had an amazing experience. We went with some friends. First off, our server Jessica was truly magnificent. I don't know how she did it, but she managed to be there reflling everything - our beverages and sides - and meeting our every need before we even knew we needed it. On top of that, she was friendly, enthusiastic, smiling. She was probably the single best server we've ever had.    This location is a renovated TGIFriday's. They did some a complete renovation, you'd never know it. My beloved had the Teriyaki Chicken with bottomless side salad. I had the Whiskey River BBQ burger with garlic/herb/parmesan fries. We had a bottomless rootbeer float. Yes, you read that right - a bottomless rootbeer float. It's one of their many bottomless beverage options. The food was truly delicious. So good, in fact, I didn't have time to photograph it. It was all fresh and had great flavor. The burger had cheese, mayo, bbq sauce, onion straws, and lettuce. It was made just as I had ordered it. The fries were good. Our friends had ordered the sweet potato fries and broccoli as their bottomless sides. The sweet potato fries were delicious as well. My wife's teriyaki chicken had great flavor, especially the slice of pineapple. So, one of the great appeals of this place is the bottomless option. All the entrees come with the regular bottomless fries. However, you can substitute a number of other bottomless options (some, like coleslaw are at no charge), others like mac and cheese or onion rings come with a slight charge. It's an amazing deal. We all ordered different sides and ended up sharing.  The atmosphere is very much a sports bar with some tv's located in the restaurant. The dining room sits on one side, and the bar on the other. The artwork is located on the ceiling. It's an unusual place for artwork, but seemed to fit. They also have a number of chalkboards on one wall with a variety of games that you can play, or to keep your children occupied. Not that you'll be waiting long. The service here was lightning fast. The restaurant was packed for a Saturday night and the noise level was loud, but we were still able to visit, which I appreciate. Each table has an electronic device that you can use to order your drinks, appetizers, call the server, etc. You have to use the device to pay, so make sure you bring a credit card. If there were negatives, they were these two things. When a different server brought our first rootbeer float, it overflowed quite a bit when she poured the rootbeer into the ice cream. The two are served in separate glasses, and it isn't easy to pour the rootbeer into the other glass without spilling. It's a beer glass, not a pitcher. So when you pour it, it runs down the side of the glass. In this case, it ran down the side, overflowed the glass and made a mess on the table and very nearly poured over me. Granted, the server got a bunch of napkins, but I was surprised they serve them that way. It's an accident waiting to happen. Secondly, this same server (again, it wasn't our primary server) brought regular fries when she brought a refill on fries, rather than the garlic/herb/parmesan fries. Since I had paid extra for the specialty fries, she really should have offered to correct her mistake and bring out the other fries. It was a small mistake in an otherwise great meal, so I let is slide. I'm simply noting that their servers should offer to correct such mistakes when they make them. All in all, we had a delightful meal and a great time visiting with friends and we will definitely return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-saint-cloud,,,,,
13,Steve P.,"Saint Cloud, MN",0,14,,3.0,2016-07-19,It was not so bad but was also not anything special. Food was decent but it's nothing that was so mouth watering that it will force me to go back.

15,Pablo E.,"Saint Cloud, MN",0,9,,4.0,2016-07-27,"The four of us all liked our food and there are countless burger options. So no complaints about the food or atmosphere.

25,Jodi L.,"Saint Cloud, MN",0,5,,1.0,2016-07-30,"First time to Red Robin. The glass of my husband's soft drink had a large hair in it.  I asked the waitress for the manager, all he did was get a new soft drink for him.  I ordered a cheeseburger, there was no taste to it, soaked with mayo.  My side salad definitely came from a grocery store bag brand.  My husbands fries not seasoned and just not appetizing.  We will never return.  We wasted our money on yucky food, slow service, and the place has no atmosphere.  Nothing like the t.v. commercials.  There a lot of things on the table that makes a person feels closterphobic!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-saint-cloud?start=20,,,,,
23,Nicole B.,"Pequot Lakes, MN",0,11,2.0,2.0,2016-08-27,This is my third time here and I keep getting more and more disappointed each time. This time I was told it would be a 15-20 min wait and can see at least 8 tables empty that they are not using. And then to top it off they seated another couple the same size as us before us even though they came in 5 or more after us. I live an hour and a half away and love red robin normally anywhere else I go but  am thinking I will start going else where because I'm more frustrated and annoyed by the time I finally get to eat and I don't enjoy my time out. They need to work on this you can see it in people's faces and hear them talk while they wait about how annoying it is. I can understand having to wait if they are full but when I can see empty tables that's not acceptable. They know they are always busy so make sure you have enough staff on if that's the reason. The food is always good once we get seated.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-saint-cloud?start=20,,,,,
20,Shannon R.,"River Falls, WI",0,2,,1.0,2016-11-05,HORRIBLE service. It took 20 minutes to get a table that was empty but dirty when we walked in.  Our waiter was at our table twice.

2,Kimberly T.,"Saint Cloud, MN",399,239,1350.0,1.0,2016-12-20,"No. No. No. Their service was excruciating. I don't know what happened to this place, but we arrived at 6:30pm on a Sunday night and we were not served our food until 7:25pm. The fries were a soggy mess, and although our waiter was sweet, he completely disappeared from our table for a solid hour and that shouldn't happen. There wasn't very many customers at all, so we didn't understand why there was no one to serve us in a prompt manner. We got our menus after 15 minutes of sitting and waiting...I kid you not...we kept looking from side to side wondering where all of the servers were. If you're trying to get a drink or an appetizer here, don't hold your breath. Go somewhere that will be quicker in serving you because you will surely be disappointed and be waiting for a long time to get a bite of anything when you come here. Their drinks are tasty but not worth sipping on melted ice for forever while hoping your server comes back. Get it together, Red Robin. P.S.-Don't get the mac & cheese burger...it is not enjoyable in the least and very small for what you'd expect it to be.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-saint-cloud,,,,,

They have a big menu that always seems to be featuring new items and best of all any of their burgers can be made with a veggie patty and sans bun with lettuce instead.

After scraping the salt off, they were very good.  The waitstaff was attentive and polite.  And using the table top, electronic pay service was easy.  It even applied a discount from my RR account, automatically.   This will not be my last time eating here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-saint-cloud,,,,,
