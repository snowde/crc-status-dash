389,Greg L.,"San Francisco, CA",138,36,78.0,4.0,2012-01-12,"Even though I'm usually not a fan of chains, Red Robin defies the norm by delivering a casual and satisfying dining experience on a consistent basis.  It's a burger place, so try to avoid the rest of the menu and just get a burger! The A1 Peppercorn Burger ($10.39) and the Burnin' Love Burger ($9.59) are my personal favorites, both delivering some serious flavor. Take note: All burgers are open to customization, so don't be afraid to substitute certain cheeses, sauces, or other items to make the perfect burger for your taste. The fries could be crispier, but they're bottom-less, and just cover them with Red Robin Seasoning or Dat Campfire Sauce! Everyone raves about the Freckled Lemonade ($3.99), and it's very good for sure, but for a change of pace, get the Root Beer Float ($3.19). Endless root beer float for that price is an absolute steal! The service is definitely friendly enough, and there are a few TVs scattered around if you want to peak at a game that's showing, which adds to that fun, casual environment.  If I'm struggling to think of a place toe eat, Red Robin is a solid standby.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=380,3.56,3.21,3.21,3.024,3.35
390,Steve B.,"Gilbert, AZ",14,32,1.0,1.0,2012-01-27,"So, here is a rather disappointing review of the Red Robin in the Paseo De Saratoga shopping center.  It all began with a burger craving, and neither of one of us wanted In-N-Out, so we decided on Red Robin.  Big mistake [tonight]. We were seated in an expeditious manner, as expected, by a pretty good hostess.  Next, comes our waitress, Ashley.  She was a little short thing, with what appeared to be a decent personality...at first.  We placed the drink order, which consisted of a patron margarita and two strawberry limeades.  It took her quite a while to bring them.  Next, comes the order.  I don't really know how difficult it is to write down on your little pad, ""bacon cheeseburger, dry, with fries.""  The next order was the Whiskey River BBQ cheeseburger (with fries), which somehow happened to arrive at the table, prepared correctly (amazing). So, during the entire time it took to dine, Ashley stopped by to 'see how things were,' just once.  We still didn't have any utensils or napkins about 10 minutes after our orders arrived.  Empty food plates and drink glasses began to pile up on our table, during which she showed absolutely no interest whatsoever in clearing them. This was not an enjoyable experience for any of the parties involved, including our little waitress, 'Ashley.'  She had a very apparent attitude problem tonight.  I just hope it gets fixed before she forces more customers to feed their appetite elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=380,3.48,3.21,3.21,2.724,3.318
446,Jessica L.,"San Jose, CA",140,50,76.0,3.0,2012-01-29,"Location/Ambiance: Located in the Paseo De Saratoga shopping center which is full of things to do, eat, and buy. I usually go here before going to the AMC in that plaza and appreciate that I can have dinner before a movie without having to get in my car in between. Red Robin is a chain restaurant and has that chain restaurant ambiance. Clean, large, with ample seating. I went one weekend and the wait was 30-40 for two people.  Food/Prices: I'm usually not a fan of chain restaurants but Red Robin is not too shabby. They have consistently good ""gourmet"" burgers at a good price that are served with delicious, BOTTOMLESS steak fries. I always get the Guacamole Bacon Burger ($9.89) - SO good! Fresh guacamole with a hint of lime, crispy bacon strips, and swiss cheese - droooool! You can customize your burger so that's a plus. One of the best things is their HONEY MUSTARD. Sometimes I crave that more than the burger. Also, their Red Robin seasoning turns those steak fries into a party. It's mainly a burger place but there are also other entrées like pasta and sandwiches but I'd avoid anything but a burger. There's a bar if you'd like an alcoholic beverage with your meal as well.

Food comes out in a timely manner. We only had to deal with waiting for our a food a bit longer than usual once, because our waitress seemed like she just started working there. Burgers: bomb dot com. Pasta: bomb dot com. Endless fries AND only a few dollars more for sweet potato fries: BOMB dot com.

Billy was our server and he was great. Supper friendly and polite. We had a $25 credit from that bad experience from a year ago. He was helpful in making sure we were able to use that credit (which we were not planning on since it was so old) and apologized for our experience then. The food was good and the wait for everything was fine. The reason they are getting 3 instead of 4 stars is I had ordered my dressing and walnuts on the side for my salad and when the food runner brought our food out she did not bring those items out.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=420,3.48,3.25,3.25,2.9240000000000004,3.342

We were seated in a booth by the kitchen, which was a bit distracting but our server made up for the crap table. Sabrina (our server) was very upbeat and patient with us (and the other tables she was looking after) and I really appreciate that, for it was my first time coming here in about 6 years and was unsure of what to order. I ended up choosing the Chophouse burger and J picked the Burning burger(?). The flavors in my burger were nice but the portion size was ridiculously small and Jason didn't like his burger much either and both of us agreed that for the price, it was a rip-off. However, the massive amount of steak fries that Sabrina kept bringing over to us made up for the pitiful sized burger. If we did come back, I would stick to stealing fries and maybe getting an appetizer instead; getting a burger smaller than a single In N Out burger for 3 times the price is ludicrous.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=480,3.4,3.25,3.25,2.8560000000000003,3.31

We were at the Saratoga location this past Sunday after seeing the Lorax with our 2 1/2 year old daughter. The restaurant was quite crowded when we got there around 6 but the wait was not bad. The manager on duty that night was extremely friendly and patient with our daughter when she asked for a balloon. Although they did not have any strings for the balloon, she went out of her way to get a straw to tie her balloon to.  This may seem like a small or insignificant fact to some but as a mother, I was very pleased to see her take the time to make my daughter happy. She even got down on her level to talk to her and when a couple approached to put their name on the list for the wait, she told them she would be with them in just a minute. She seemed to be doing it because she truly cared and not because she had to. In this day and age, when most staff/managers at restaurants seem like they never want to be bothered by children, this small act of kindness made my daughter and in turn me, very happy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=440,3.44,3.26,3.26,3.188,3.3320000000000003

I often go here because it's a cool place to meet up or go before seeing a movie at the Amc theaters.  I am mostly writing this review because of the exceptional service I had he on my most recent visit by the waiter andres.this guy was on top of it! He was nice yet to the point. He brought us some fries while we were waiting for our burgers and kept the refills coming without us ever needing to ask. He was like a mind reader.  When we were done he offered to split the bill for us, this is the first time I think any waiter has ever offered this to me before. I thought that was awesome. If I had this sort of service every time I would probably come here more often. Me and my friend made sure to tip Andres well before we left. I may even ask for his section next time I go back here.

585,Esma B.,"Campbell, CA",31,3,1.0,1.0,2012-04-07,"first i must add a little personal note and state that i was raised with small portions and organic meat and with a dedicated and talented mother that cooked excellent meals nearly every night. it was my first time coming in today with the family (family of 4 - two kids) and might I just say now my last as well. I came in with a fresh mind and hungry stomach and was excited to try my first American restaurant. As soon as we got seated after 25 minutes it took the waitress 10 minutes to bring drinks and be ready to take our order. we ordered an appetizer specifically so we can munch on before the meal, however the appetizer didn't come until 20 minutes later along with the food! I thought appetizers come immediately(?) or else we wouldn't have ordered it in the first place!! now I ordered my first prime ribs and i was extremely displeased. not only was it expensive but it really doesnt taste like meat. it tastes like a bunch of hormones and false tenderizers. I'm sure right now if I were to apply extensive research and figure out what was in those ribs I would be very displeased; and not to mention how my stomach just didnt take that sandwich at all well. fries were okay, I just felt that everything was extremely greasy as well as one of their classic burgers on the menu (I stole a bite from my brothers burger). now not to mention how LOUSY the service at that place is. no towels on the table? two time request for hot sauce? forgetting water? extra refills on things we never requested? I'm sorry, but I've been to other places which is a little bit better than that.

The burgers were smaller than I remembered but the bonzai burger was still pretty yummy. My mom liked her mushroom burger too. Warning: We're not really burger people so it's hard for me to compare with other burger places. We upgraded two of our regular fries to the sweet potato fries for 80 cents (still bottomless though!). The sweet potato fries were a huge hit amongst my family, parents included. Try it plain before you decide to add extra stuff on the fries because I liked it just the way it was (although I have to say that the Red Robin seasoning is yum-o, but way salty).  We came on a random Tuesday night around 7pm so I was surprised that there was such a long waiting time. We had a 7 person party and had to wait close to 40 minutes before we were seated.

At this point, I felt as if they couldn't split six checks so I tried my hardest understand. Fast forward to the check, and one of the managers told us that they could definitely split the check six ways.  So why the two separate checks? I can only come up with two possibilities: 1) you're lazy 2) you're stupid It's part of your job, dude. Is splitting two checks three ways really any harder than splitting one check six ways? Okay. I might be a little harsh, but the situation just baffles me to no end. The onion rings stack were delicious and the game day nachos were good as well, but not enough to get me to come back.

But I decided to give them a chance and came here relatively early on a Friday night.  The place was busy, but wasn't totally packed.  As usual, they said it was a 30 minute wait.  One hour later, my friends and I were seated.  I don't think they actually do any estimations; they just say 30 minutes regardless of how busy they are. A friend of mine has the menu here memorized, so as soon as we're seated she orders a bunch of appetizers for us.  It takes 45 minutes before the food shows up, and the waitress disappears for 20 minutes at a time.  Our burgers come out a little over an hour after we place our orders.  Water and drinks were left empty, and they didn't even give us utensils until 10 minutes after they brought our food. If the food was awesome I might overlook the bad service, but other than the awesome onion rings the rest of the food sucked.  The burgers were all burnt.  We had one child with us who ordered the grilled cheese, and the cheese wasn't melted.   A side order of mac and cheese came out cold.   I've been to other Red Robins, and they're not my favorite place but they're a decent place to get burgers.  I'm staying away from this one for good though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=560,3.28,3.22,3.22,3.0120000000000005,3.2440000000000007

I have to say Red Robin BRAVO, because you made my first experience a good one.  I have to admit I was scared. Eating out is almost impossible when you are gluten intolerant. SO imagine my wonderful surprise when I heard they had a gluten free menu.

Ordering: I tried not to make my gluten problem a problem so I didn't tell my waiter, much to my boyfriends dismay. I ordered the cheeseburger. Protein style when I asked if they had a seperate fryer for their fries He said yes but looked at me weird. I asked for fries with no seasoning. My boyfriend couldn't handle it anymore and said ""she can't have gluten"" A big look of realization came across the waiters face and he said ""we have a gluten free bun.""  GLUTEN FREE BUN!!! I almost died. YES please.  I ordered my food feeling so happy and when it arrived I was so happy because apparently when you have allergies you get a yellow basket that means the manager prepares it or whatever so you are sure it is perfect and gluten free.

Yes good and the bun was not lacking. I have to say though they added relish to my burger which I hate relish but  that was probably my fault. The bun is an extra $1 but it is worth it.

The server even flirted with my friend's baby boy and chatted with us a bit. Shortly after she took our order, she disappeared. Thankfully, we'd had the foresight to ask for both our drinks and a separate glass of water. By the time the server reappeared, all our glasses were empty. It took about 30 minutes to get our food and it really just seemed our server was in the weeds. That confused me, seeing as how the restaurant wasn't even halfway full and it was a random Thursday night. We had to ask for a few things multiple times (like drink refills), and my friend was disappointed when her mac and cheese came out SUPER al dente, not to mention COLD. My burger was super tasty at least (and hot!), and I got to sub out the bun and a salad for fries, which made me happy. But would I go out of my way to come here again? Nope.

415,Lauren S.,"San Jose, CA",140,129,1.0,4.0,2012-07-12,"First off, I don't typically come to this one, because it's the furthest from my house. Secondly, my future husband really doesn't like this place. at all. ever. But after last night, I think I might have changed his mind. Rather successfully, I might add! After a shopping trip at Westgate, he wanted Amatto's. I like the sandwiches, but I just wasn't in the *mood* for it. So after much deliberation, I conceded and started to drive towards Santa Clara. Finally, he said, just go where you want! I said, but you don't LIKE where I want! Eventually HE conceded, and we turned around and headed to Red Robin.  The wait was pretty long - we heard they were short staffed - so we put out name in and scouted for a place at the bar. After about 10 minutes, a place opened up, so we snagged it. John, the bartender, was quick, friendly, and poured with a pretty heavy hand, and was really nice to look at! By the time we were eating our appetizer, our name was being called (even though I had told the hostess we were sitting in the bar, whatever). Our food came quickly, and John was always quick to fill out drinks and ask how things were going for is. The future husband decided he liked his Blue Ribbon Burger, and of course, I loved my Baja Turkey Melt. REALLY sad that they're no longer serving their AWESOME french onion soup anymore! Overall, I would come back here tomorrow to sit in the bar again. Also! Happy hour prices are seriously DIRT cheap. I'm a whiskey drinker, and their well whiskey is Barton's. Not too bad, especially for $2.50 for a whiskey and coke! Small domestic drafts are also $2.50, big ones are just $3.50. Happy hour runs from 3-6 and 8-close.

354,Jess D.,"Los Angeles, CA",1080,56,16.0,2.0,2012-07-20,"RED ROBIN...............................y u u u u u c k....... I went here for dinner with a party of 3 around 8:45pm tonight. Being it was nearly 9pm on a Thursday evening, I didnt expect a wait, but there was a 20 minute wait, which ended up taking 25 minutes.  As soon as we sat down, the person I was with said ""I bet the service is gonna suck tonight"" and boy, were they right.  First of all, being this Red Robin is right next to a movie theater, and Batman is showing at midnight tonight, along with the movie's trilogy, the manager of this location should have had the common sense to over staff, rather than under staff.  Nearly half of the restaurant was empty, but due to the fact the customer ratio was greater than the server ratio, everything just ran as slow as Eeyore on heroin.  The chefs were more backed up then the Octo-moms birth canal.  It took nearly 40 minutes to get our food after we ordered. When we finally got our food, they said ""oh they are making your sweet potato fries, so we brought you some regular fries to go with your burger for now"". Oh really!? Gee, thanks.... because I had no idea that sweet potato fries took 45 minutes to cook. Maybe Miss Idaho herself was back in the kitchen peeling them?  A few minutes later, the sweet potato fries FINALLY arrived. I was hoping that after the first bite, my teeth would turn solid gold or something spectacular would happen, due to the fact... they took so damn long, but unfortunately.... nope, they were just plain ol' sweet potato fries.  After finishing up, we asked for the check. The waitress informed my party that she went ahead and comped our drinks and took off the $1.00 charge for the sweet potato fries. Personally, I feel she should have given us all mani/pedi's to make it up to us, being the entire experience sucked as bad as the Star Wars prequel.  But with some restaurant chains, bad service and bad food is to be expected.  Let's just say that the ride back, wasnt a walk in the park, and more like a rush to the nearest restroom.  I felt as though I was in labor all over again and with every red stop light, the pain and breathing got worse.  The pains in my stomach felt as though the lolipop guild were doing a kickline against my insides.  I began to sweat and feel more and more awful.  My burger flashed through my imagination still moo-ing at me, all pink in the middle, and giving me the middle finger, telling me, ""payback is a b!tch"".  I felt like I for sure got a piece of mad cow on my plate, and maybe now it was multiplying inside me wanting revenge?... Maybe all of my vegan friends back in LA werent just ""food hipsters"" afterall? Maybe this vegan thing wasnt such a bad idea? I thought to myself. Finally, after the pain subsided and I awoke next to the toilet ((kidding)), I realized that maybe it was time to end things with Red Robin. Time to tell the 'big red faced guy' that it was over, and I wouldnt be seeing him or his delicious drinks anymore (and no, I am not talking about Mel Gibson).  This might take some time to get over. Afterall, I never experienced anything like this before with Red Robin or my innards, for that matter.  Needless to say, I wont be coming back. It was a fun ride, but a bumpy one. It was fun while it lasted, but not while it blasted. Well, you get the point.... ",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=340,3.28,3.31,3.31,3.0160000000000005,3.298

The garlic fries are amazing especially if they are straight out of the fryer.  Don't forget to signup/register for a Red Robin card. Get a free free burger after purchasing 9. I think you also get a free appetizer on your first use (verify that this hasn't changed). You also get a free birthday burger in your birthday month.

OK, you're now saying ""what's the difference then?"". The difference is that there's more edges to the burger to get the flavor of their grill. It really makes a huge difference.

To our surprise they had remodeled the whole restaurant. The waitress said they were trying to get away from the Chuck E Cheese feel. The Food: The food is always great but this time it seemed extra tasty and not as greasy. I don't think they changed the menu items but it tasted a bit better than before. I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger which I always order when I go here. I did notice that the bacon seemed to be of better quality than before. Not only that but I received three strips of bacon vs. the two that they normally give out. I got my burger on a wheat bun with American cheese. They waitress did ask how I wanted my burger cooked, some pink or cooked all the way through. I like it juicy so I went with some pink and I'm not sure if they gave you this option before. The hot date got a Chicken Caesar wrap which she said it also tasted good.  The Staff: The staff was nice as always. I did notice that they stopped wearing jeans like before. It's a little dressy and it looks nice, so long as they feel comfortable in their attire. The waitress came around a few times to make sure everything is ok. The only thing that sucks was that we did not get offered drinks or a refill on fries before the check was brought out. It's not like I was hungry after the meal, but it would have been nice if we were offered.  The Restaurant: As I said above, they remodeled the whole place. The layout was similar as before. The bar on the same side and the restrooms are located in the same spot too. They changed up the booths and made everything nicer. They moved the TV's around and added new pictures and frames. They even had framed pictures on the ceiling (dangerous, would not want to sit there) which looked cool!

The restaurant was initially packed, but the service speed did not pick up after the crowds cleared out. We started with the giant onion ring tower as appetizer. It was delicious and crunchy (and the probably best part of the meal). I loved the dipping sauces, especially the BBQ one. For entrees, we ordered the Ensenada Chicken Platter and the Whiskey River BBQ Wrap. The chicken was rather dry and bland. It had the exquisite taste and texture of cardboard paper. The BBQ Wrap was about the same. It makes me wonder whether Red Robin microwaves their food like Applebee's. The Cookie Magic shake was noticeably better than McDonald's Oreo McFlurry. (Apples to apples right?) However, its signature monster size has gone on a diet and is much smaller than I remember it during college. Was quite disappointed when I finished it a third of the way into the meal. The clam chowder soup was quite good and about the same quality as the ones I get from Safeway. I recommend it. On the other hand, the French Onion soup (which is supposed to contain sweet caramelized onions) was the saltiest I've ever tasted. I imagine the chef accidentally dumped half a cup of salt into it.

First off, I really like the food here. The whiskey BBQ burger is my goto burger, subbing onion rings for fries and having at least one friend get fries so we get bottomless fries :) the jungle shake is pretty good too as I have recently discovered and red robin now offers some mini patty options for a dollar or two less.  Pricing is average, ~$10 a burger with fries. Nothing special.  The service on the other hand is totally hit or miss. In recent trips, I'd have to say I'm not impressed and last time I went the waiter never gave us any fries even though we asked for them the moment we sat down. He said he'd get them twice but never did, and it was a slow afternoon so that really disappointed me. In olden days, the staff would practically force feed us fries and keep them coming - that's what drew me to Red Robin in the first place and kept me going over the years. I even went for 3 of my birthdays in a row in high school! The location next to Amc 14 Saratoga recently remodeled and it looks pretty nice now. Food tastes delicious still.

Definitely consider joining their FREE rewards club (one aside-we visited several times before a bartender mentioned its existence) and you get a FREE burger in your bday month, plus other rewards if you eat their frequently. A note about my reviews: I only give FIVE STARS for places that absolutely blow me away and rock my world. FOUR stars means a place I would frequent and feel comfortable suggesting to anyone. THREE stars is a place with potential or an occasional visit. TWO stars means we had a neutral or slightly negative experience.

I ordered the Beserker (promotional burger tied in with the Wolverine movie). It was supposed to be a burger with aoli and Sriracha onion straws on a brioche bun. I asked for the aoli on the side since I don't usually like my burger slathered with greasy condiments. When I got it, the overall taste was okay, but I didn't taste the Sriracha at all. So, I asked the server if I could have some extra on the side. He came back with a little cup of some kind of powder and said that was what they used. Sriracha powder?! That stuff is awesome! I sprinkled it lavishly all over my burger and fries, and that was the best burger meal I've ever had at Red Robin. Overall, I like coming here with my family. The service is usually pretty decent, and the updated decor is nice. My kids like having their junk food treat here and love stealing sips of Freckled Lemonade and the big, fat home fries. I wouldn't come here if you're watching your calories, though. Even the salads are pretty calorie-dense. I miss the free burger on your birthday without the hassle of getting the silly card, though.

Mostly every time we've gone, we received great customer service, though, once in a while (as with every restaurant type establishment) the service was a little slow.  This last time that my girlfriend and I went, we decided to share a burger. We waited for about 25 minutes after we ordered, until our server came to our table. He told us that there had been a mix up with our order and that they were making it. Meanwhile, he brought us a basket of fries and told us our meal would be taken care of.  Within minutes, he returned with the burger, and left us to eat. We realized that the burger had been made normal(both my gf and I aren't a fan of the pickle relish), and asked if he could bring a bun without the pickle relish. He apologized again and brought his manager who informed us that they'd be making a second burger, and a bun for the burger on our table as well as a gift card for next time.  Talk about above and beyond.  Of course, by this time, we'd been there for about 45 minutes and were starving, however, her genuine concern for our meal by checking up on us a few times after they brought the second burger was reason enough to write a review.

When we were seated, we were greeted by a nice waitress who served us our waters quickly.  We took a while to decide what we wanted but she was very patient and checked up on us without being pushy.   I ordered the Whiskey River BBQ burger and it was pretty good considering I am not a Red Robin fan.  The burger was nicely cooked and the toppings were not overwhelming.  I would expect a BBQ burger to be dripping with barbecue sauce but it was not overwhelming.  The crispy onion straws on the burger were a nice touch and every other bite I would crunch on a piece of bacon.  The bun however, was not toasted to my liking (or at all really) as well as everyone else's buns.  I guess they don't toast their buns or they were really busy that day... My big problem with Red Robin is their ""endless"" fries are usually not endless and floppy.  Our waitress asked if we wanted more fries but I was satisfied with the fries I had.  The manager also came by and asked if we were satisfied with our meals, which we appreciated.  The steak fries were also very crispy!  Not one was soggy, which made me very happy.  The fries were tasty AND they were actually endless. Overall, I was pleased by my dining experience.  The service was great and the food was good.  I still prefer the Island chain to RR, but I am starting to reconsider after that Whiskey burger!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=120,2.44,3.27,3.264,2.352,2.9379999999999997

I should have known that the story would not end well when we were told out wait would be 15 minutes and clearly half the tables were empty. We.ordered the onion rings and zucchini for appetizers. The rings were ok but we only got half an order of the zucchini and the waitress made no move to fix the order after it was brought to her attention. The riblets and clucks was the most awful dish. The riblets were literally broiled in a pile causing them to char and stick together like a pile of meat marshmallows which were then dumped into a soup of nasty bbq sauce. The only redeeming aspect of the dish were the French fries which came out 5 minutes after the rest of the dishes but were at least hot.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=400,2.16,3.19,3.236,2.116,2.778

Oh well, we ordered a glass of $4.50 house red (Rex Groth) and a Screaming Zombi.  Wine was bleh but it's $4.50 so what can I expect but my daughter enjoyed her Screaming Zombi quite a bit.  Not too sweet, not to bitter and plenty of booze to make ya ""feel"" it.   The hubs and I have come here a few times for the food.  The burgers are good.  Nothing outstanding but good for a chain restuarant.  I tried their onion dip and didn't really care for that.  The chips were weird and the dip was way to sweet.  Oh well, gotta try it at least once right?  Service is consistantly good. Very friendly bartenders and the crew keeps the tables cleaned after folks leave.   Red Robin really caters to families and young adults.  My daughter came here with friends often when she was in High School.  It's not a place I would choose for dinner just because I've had my fill of chain burger joints but it's a nice stop in before or after catching a movie at AMC14.  They have a small outdoor patio that faces the parking lot when the weather isn't to bad.  This place does get busy on the weekends and evenings .  I've driven by plenty of times and the line was nuts.  So if you're planning to visit, I'd come early.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=180,2.24,3.1,3.212,2.38,2.7560000000000002

In the end the second burger came out great and he finished it without another problem. But something I wasn't satisfied with is that they charged us for the hair burger and the second burger. We ended up paying for both but I'm really upset at how we have to pay for someone else's mistake and a burger with the managers hair in it.

Now here comes the fun part, after getting our food still hasn't got me some water. I asked about 5 times before getting a refill on my water. My friends also had to wait forever to get a refill and when our server came to our table he would even let us get a word in before he would leave.

Burgers here are definitely gourmet- flavorful, filling portions and a great variety to choose from. I tried their ""sauteed shroom"" burger with a vegan patty. Mushrooms on my burger tasted delicious and patty was juicy too. Bun was fresh. Substituted steak fries for sweet potato fries- which were BOMB! We also tried their shakes- banana  and cookie dough- both were delicious. Onions rings are average. I like that Red Robin has tons of choice in their menu. Even if you are not a burger person- you will find something for your tastebuds (sandwiches, wraps, appetizers, shakes, desserts). Also, they have the ability to customize their menu- you can substitute a salad or coleslaw or sweet potato fries for their regular fries (all burgers are served with bottomless fries). If you are a vegetarian you can turn any burger into veggie burger by just substituting it with a vegan patty. They also offer a variety of buns to choose from.  Then why am I holding back one star? I wish my food came out a little more hot than it did (at best my burger was luke warm, with cheese slice just softened but not melted enough; onion rings were also at room temperature). Service here was excellent. Kaylee was our server. She has a good sense of humor and is very attentive. She got our order right and refills were served promptly. She checked on us regularly to ensure a great dinning experience. I would certainly recommend this place especially if you have a large group since seating here is plenty (indoors and outdoors) and wait time is generally limited.

If you do, don't come hungry, and expect to wait.  The decor is disjunct, the wait is interminable, the food is mediocre, and the bathrooms are smelly. If you sit in a booth by the far wall, there's even a draft coming through the bottom of the window frame.  Our wait time for a table was quoted at 20 minutes, but ended up being closer to 30. Their handy app showed our place on the list. Once seated, however, it was another waiting game. We ordered a mud pie and some drinks to pass the time before our burgers arrived. We waited 10 minutes for the pie/drinks, and then 30 minutes for our burgers. Good thing we weren't starving! Our server Jeff hustled like crazy to serve us, apologizing for the wait, and attentively checking in. His hustle was to no avail, though, as the kitchen seemed to be moving at glacial speed. We could see that the few orders that were partially made sat under heat lamps for several minutes, awaiting last parts/ingredients before runners/servers brought them out. All the employees looked frazzled and exhausted. What a mess.  There were empty two-top tables over by the bar that could have been filled. Large parties often take up many tables and sit for long periods of time. This creates a backup for smaller dining groups. These could have easily been arranged into those bar tables.  I always look forward to the bottomless fries. Today, though, they were soggy and mushy. I didn't even finish the ones on my plate. My tavern double burger came lopsided, with tomatoes arranged on one side of my burger.

The wait for food is just ridiculous. 40+ minutes just to get a chicken sandwiches for 3/4 people?  None of the servers we had we attentive or offered anything while we waited. The drinks took forever to get, the refills took even longer.  Hint: when you want the server to bring something extra (like extra barbecue or campfire sauce) tell them BEFORE you get your food. We made the sad mistake of asking when we got our food initially and didn't get what we asked for until we were finished.  The last time we went, our server gave me the wrong food but I decided to eat it anyways because it took 45 minutes to get it and I was starving. The manager on duty took it off our bill, thankfully.  We had to talk to the manager twice and was offered a discount on our overall bill, but because we asked for separate checks, the discount was taken off. Our server (the last time we went) told us that our discount would be taken off if we got separate checks, but she could find the manager and have him apply the discount to each check and that it would just take a little longer. Since we were there for 2 hours anyway, what's another few minutes? She came back 10 minutes later with our bills.... And no discount.  Just absolutely the worst service I've ever had 3 times in a row at the same place, different servers. Train your servers to be more customer friendly, or hire a new staff.

434,Erin B.,"Sunnyvale, CA",19,11,,2.0,2014-07-13,"We've been long-time customers of this particular Red Robin restaurant, long before it was given a facelift and calling itself a ""bistro.""  Let me tell you, from one burger lover to another, that it has pretty much gone downhill since then.  While the menu has expanded, offering new things like chili cheese fries and a myriad of dipping sauces, the quality and consistency of the food (particularly takeout) has taken a serious nose dive.  For example, a couple of nights ago my husband and I ordered our usual takeout meal, including chili cheese fries and mac and cheese.  We've ordered these items a dozen times in the past, and let's just say that we have gotten something a little different each time. It all depends on who is in the kitchen and who is packaging the food.   To be fair, there have been times when there has been a lot of love put into our meal, and it has shown through the quality of the burger, the amount of chili put on the fries, and how neatly it was packaged. This time, when we asked for chili cheese fries, we were told that they were ""out of chili.""  Out of chili??!??!  How can you be out of chili???  The mac and cheese was literally buttered pasta with shredded cheese sprinkled on top.  On TOP, and not mixed into it.  ARE YOU SERIOUS.  Who the hell makes their mac and cheese like that?  Were they banking on the heat of the pasta melting the cheese while it sat in the to go container?  I literally had to throw it in a saucepan and add our own cheese and milk.  Really??!   Also, the packaging of the food was horrendous.  Foil sloppily wrapped around the burger, burger boxes a little smashed with shreds of cheese stuck to it... you get the picture. That reminds me, one time when we dined in the restaurant, we were actually told that they were out of mac and cheese.  What?!?   It's just pasta, cheese, butter, and milk, for Pete's sake.  How often do they stock their kitchen??? Regarding quality of service, we've actually had quite pleasant experiences with all of our servers.  So, that's why I'm being pretty generous and giving two stars instead of one. All in all, when Red Robin is good, it can be really good.  However, when it's bad, it's annoyingly AWFUL.  And, unfortunately, we've experienced more bad than good lately, so we're hesitant to come back for another dine-in or takeout experience.  Just not worth the money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=420,2.36,2.6,3.064,2.088,2.504

We sent them back. Sara came back afterwards with our corrected burgers and third appetizer. While eating my Mom discovered she had no avocado.  We give up on trying anymore. The manager comes by, in addition to Sara, to apologize for getting so many things wrong with our order. When we got the blithely compared our burgers and my drink. Overall, we've definitely had better there. Hopefully management works out the kinks in the kitchen so food is made how the customer wants and brought in a timely manner. Sara was a great waitress.

335,Maryanne R.,"Cupertino, CA",62,448,18.0,1.0,2014-08-02,"We arrived tonight, a Saturday, at 8 pm and were quoted a 30-minute wait time.  They called us shortly before the 30 minutes.  Hostess sat us at a table with a dirty seat, and a crayon still on it from the last guests. The waiter came over and asked about drinks.  I said that we definitely want 4 waters.  My husband and kids ordered milkshakes.  He brought only one water for me.  My husband ordered three more waters.  He brought the shakes over and again, my husband ordered three more waters.  He brought half the waters in the freckled lemonade glasses and half in their giant pint-style glasses. He took the order and that was the last we saw of our ""server"". The food took too long, and was not hot.  We had to ask the food runner to bring some cutlery and napkins.  No one came over to check on us to see if we needed drink refills, fry refills, find out if out food was okay.  Nothing.  I've never seen anything like it.  Also, none of the other staff made eye contact with us.  I was trying to get someone's attention, anyone, to get a drink refill, but no one even looked our way.  Finally, my husband had to get up and ask the hostess to have someone bring us a bill. I think we fell throught the cracks at Red Robin tonight.  All I can think is that our served got phased, or he started the table for another server - I don't know, but something went wrong and we got the short end of the stick. Then, the very casually dressed manager came over, did not identify himself as a manager, and said ""It looks like you're all done here, can I get anything else for you?""  We said that we'd like the bill and a soda refill.  He brought the soda refill, apologized that I had to wait more than 15 minutes for a refill, and then said he was going to adjust the check and find out who was responsible for this.  Buddy, we don't care who is responsible, we just want to go home.  It was nice of him to take a random $13.30 amount off the check, but it took another 10 minutes to get out of there.  He dropped the check and said, ""I know you want to go, so....."" and kind of trailed off.  My husband was reaching into his pocket for his wallet as the manager was saying that, and yet he left the table and never came back.  We finally got the attention of the server who was waiting on a table next to ours and she ran our check.   This location was so good right after they remodelled the place about a year ago.  They were so on it.  The staff was smiling, upbeat, professional, following all the steps of service and they weren't raffling off the dishes when they got to the table, they just put them in front of who ordered them, which was very impressive for a casual family restaurant.  Well, that's all gone out the window now.  After tonight's lack of service and the quality of the food on our two most recent visits, we won't be back.  Next time it'll be Island's, or Five Guys, or SmashBurger, or The Counter, or one of the other MANY burger choices in the area for us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=320,2.44,2.56,3.044,2.116,2.512

We were waiting for our food to come out and bam! My mom starts sliding down below the table because she was seated on a broken booth that was being balanced on a freakin' bucket! A bucket?! Seriously?! Now my mom is a petite woman at 5'1 and the booth just slid. Imagine if it were a couple of kids sitting at the booth? Good thing my mom was able to catch herself. When the manager came out my mom told her how dangerous it was to have a broken booth like that and she simply put the seat back saying she didn't know it was broken. Oh and no apology or concern for my mom's well being was given. Awesome customer service RR. Needless to say we walked out not wanting our food anymore.

Twice they have lost our order ticket and we had to wait over an hour for our food. The first time the server would come by and say that it should be out soon and it wasn't until a manager came by and told us what happened. They ended up comping our meal but we were there for a good 3 hours. Today they lost part of our order. How does that even happen? The lost order was a simple sandwich.  For every single visit we have had to wait for fries. You would think that a place that advertises all you can eat fries would make sure that they had enough fries ready. One time we waited over 30 minutes because the kitchen was so backed up. We got 2 baskets today and one was nice and fresh and the other was stale and had what I call ""fry bits"". Just pieces of French fries from the bottom of the fry basket. I couldn't believe they would even serve that garbage.

First of all...parking here is HORRIBLE (thanks to the theatre) and wait times here are HORRIBLE (you can guess why...thanks to the theatre). The bar area here is super tiny, and the restaurant has a very odd, narrow lay out. The main dining room you get a view of the kitchen (which is SUPER loud btw). Putting all that aside, one thing Red Robin does is try to make dinner a good value. They have all sorts of cheap appetizers and most burgers are around $10 with bottomless fries. Quality isn't as good as before, but for the price you're paying, it's not a bad deal! I stick with the Royal Red Robin or Whiskey River BBQ burgers and they are usually done well! They have a bunch of dipping sauces which are good too.  Fair prices on drinks, but they aren't very generous on pours. Well drinks come in taller pint-style glasses, so you end up with a standard serving with 90% mixer. My vodka lemonade was so watered down, I complained to the manager who admitted that she has to order a double. She was nice enough to comp the drinks and give us a free speciality cocktail on the house, but I won't be drinking here anymore...unless it's a beer or something! Overall, it's too much of a hassle!

She apologized and mumbled some excuse as she went to the bar. She comes back a few minutes later and states they were out of the beer we ordered. So it takes 20 minutes to figure that out?! Uhh, no. Regardless we ordered a different kind of beer and received our drinks a few minutes later, which was after we got our dinner, which was both annoying and ridiculous. The fries were cold and the burger was not good. The buns were cold and tasted like they came straight out of a bag, which I'm sure they did, but they should at least warm them up. The BBQ sauce was insanely overwhelming and the crispy onion strings that were on the burger were a soggy flavorless mess.

288,Sara B.,"San Jose, CA",0,11,22.0,2.0,2014-10-18,"""Doggie entitlement mentality"" runs rampant around here.  We realize that.  California realizes it too, so this summer the governor signed a law that allows pet owners to bring their pets along to a restaurant as long as they remain on the patio.  It is still illegal to bring any animal inside a restaurant, unless it is a service animal. So imagine our surprise and dismay when we went to this Red Robin location a couple of nights ago and were seated in the dining room, only to discover that a woman at the table next to us had her smallish (Pomeranian?) dog under the table.  She had even put two little dishes (one filled with dog food and one with water) on the floor under the table, so this little prince (or princess?) could have its meal, too, though this did not stop the little creature from continually begging for scraps (which were occasionally given...yuck), nor from stepping in its water dish a few times as it wandered around beneath the table.  This was clearly a pampered family pet, not any kind of service animal.  WHAT was it doing in a restaurant? I should mention that the outside temperature that evening was very mild.  It would have been entirely comfortable for this lady and her doggie to sit on the patio and LEGALLY enjoy their meal.  It would even have been perfectly fine for her to leave her precious pet in the car for an hour or so...it was NOT hot and would not have posed any danger to the animal. Allowing people to bring their pets into a restaurant is just irresponsible and cowardly behavior by the restaurant's team and management.  I realize that people in this area can get pretty worked up if they are told that their precious pets cannot go everywhere and do everything that humans do...but that's just tough.  Managers can and should stand up to them and uphold the law for the benefit, health, and enjoyment of the other restaurant guests!  If a guest really believes that their dog should be treated like family, then they should either eat on the patio where their pets are legally allowed, or stay home and eat at the family (and dog) table! A disappointing and gross experience.  We expected better from Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=280,2.4,2.37,3.02,2.152,2.382

221,Clark S.,"San Jose, CA",5,13,,1.0,2014-11-29,"We love Red Robin.  We used to visit this location a lot when it first opened, and it was well worth the visit every time.  Banzai Burger.  Need I say more? But since the latest remodel, unless we just had a string of bad luck in our visits,  either the management has changed or something fundamental shifted but this is a place that needs serious help.  Service quality is seriously diminished.  Certainly there are some good people working there, but errors in orders and long waits for food shouldn't be the norm.  Food quality and presentation has also slipped.  It isn't the same experience at all. We keep telling ourselves we'll never go back, but tonight, after watching a movie at the AMC, we decided to give it another chance for dessert, and arrived to no hostess at the front station at all (waited for five minutes and even asked staff if anyone was available to no avail).  We had to leave knowing we would be stuck in there for a VERY long time.  The only folks waiting aside from us was a family who walked out with us complaining they had sat there for 30 minutes looking at a number of empty tables filled with uncleared dishes that were not being tended to. The place was a mess.    Red Robin is a repeatable concept.  It is a successful franchise. It has an established system that should be easy for any conscious manager to sustain.  I have no idea why this place has tanked, but it needs to wake up and get the fix it needs.  We'll come back when it decides to be a restaurant that cares about its customers again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=220,2.52,2.45,2.996,2.052,2.478

When there is a wait, they have a system that sends you a text when your table is ready and also allows you to see how many people are in front of you all from your own smartphone. The system was very helpful and interesting and made my experience start out on a positive note. On to the food! We ordered a bowl of clam chowder, fish and chips, and a bacon burger. The food was very good, but did take a little too long to come out.  Clam chowder 4/5: came out quickly, was almost lukewarm, but tasted very good and had a lot of clams  Fish and Chips 4/5: took a little too long to come out, but was very moist and seasoned nicely Bacon burger 5/5: again took a little too long to come out, but was a very tasty and moist burger (definitely worth the wait), came with decent fries Overall, my first time at Red Robin was better than average. We only had to wait 2-3 minutes until we were seated and our friendly waitress came and checked on us quite often. From the other reviews I read, it is true that many tables are left uncleaned for quite some time and is one of the reasons that there are long lines outside, so come earlier to prevent the wait!

Now service was way slower. It took like 15 minutes to get our drinks, and when we ordered our food it took almost an 1 hour to get. I ordered the Fish and Cod, and it was ""soggy"". I didn't want to send it back because I didn't know how long it was going to take, since we already waited an hour to eat. My mom ordered the same thing, and her's was just as soggy as mine. They messed up on my friend's order, and had to send it back. I know it wasn't just our table because the table next to us sent their food back several times due to mistakes.

Later right before we were leaving Pricilla became a puppy dog to Amanda just to keep talking to her and laughing.

Not bad, so we waited. We were finally seated at 7:05. It took about 5 minutes for the waitress to come and greet us and take our drink orders. We ordered our appetizer and our food at the same time. The appetizer came out really quick. We finished that and then the waiting began...we waited. And waited. Until I finally asked the waitress about our food. Meanwhile, I had seen my salad sitting on the line for about 15 to 20 minutes. She brings my salad out, the chicken was cold. The waitress tells us that the burger was just being put together now. They hadn't even fired it!!! The burger finally came out about 8pm and it was raw inside!!! The cheese wasn't melted, and the fries were soggy!!! I couldn't believe it. We asked for a manager immediately. She came out, offered to cook the hamburger herself and get me a fresh salad. Guess what? The burger was STILL raw! The manager was apologetic, but kept touching my boyfriend on the arm, inappropriate if you ask me. I ate a bit of my salad, but we were so turned off, we left without paying.  Needless to say, we will NEVER go back. How can a hamburger place fail so miserably and not be able to cook a damn hamburger properly!?! And by the way, the habits of the staff while pulling food from the line, is disgusting. They will touch your food, fondle your fries and be sure to touch the hamburger buns after touching everything. So gross.

First of all the hostess told me that it was a 15 minute wait for a part of two. 40 minutes later my sister and I were finally seated.  Then it once we ordered, it was another hour wait for our burgers. When I finally received my guacamole burger I was devastated when there was the tiniest smear of guacamole on my burger. I couldn't even taste the guacamole or even see it on my burger. Consequently my burger had no flavor.  When I asked for a refill in my bottomless fries it took another half hour to refill them. What is the point of saying bottomless fries if they are going to take forever. I was still waiting for my fries when everyone had finished their food. Finally my fries came and they were okay.  Before I even left the restaurant I had to run to the bathroom. I had gotten good poisoning! I don't have other digestive issues so I know that it was because of the food I had just eaten.  Finally after two hours of mostly waiting and paying to be being poisoned I will not be back to Red Robin ever again.

It's really irritating how they tried to remodel it by looking so upscale, especially with how they plate food. I ordered a BBQ chicken burger and my parents got two different salads. I bit into my chicken burger and it was COLD and RAW. My parents salads had burnt chicken and old lettuce. After that, we just decided to give everything back.

My mother went with the Patty melt with Thousand Island dressing on a bun. 28 minutes later our food was served in the tiniest portions. Mine was one burger, NOT two, with ""mixed fruit"" of mandarin slice, (ya know the one in the can), squishy strawberries and about 1/4 of a cup worth. My burger was definitely kid size at $8.49 price. For 50 cents more I could have gotten a normal size one.... My mothers was a joke. Her buns, crumpled in her hands and fell apart since it was so old and stale. I asked if there was even thousand island on it. After dissecting her food we found a thimble full. She received a handful of fries and thankfully the waitress saw our disgust and brought another handful. If we weren't going to see a movie we would have returned the food. I wrote on the receipt, this was our first time and we will never be back. With so many competing Burger Joints my suggestion is to NOT waste your money here. Bill came to $34 plus some change.

I ordered the Bleu Burger to go, which featured a delicious medium cooked patty with deep fried onions, tomato, lettuce, and cheese sandwiched between two onion-flavored buns. The quality of the meat patty was absolutely superb - juicy, flavorful, and melt-in-your-mouth fantastic and definitely so much better than I anticipated from a burger chain. I would definitely recommend this burger for first-timers! The price of the burgers here are a little bit on the higher end ($8 and up), but it's definitely worth every buck when you taste how good they are. Also, your burger comes with a side of fries of your choice, ranging from steakcut fries to sweet potato fries to garlic fries. I'm always a fan of sweet potato fries, and they are definitely delicious here as well. Love Red Robin and cannot wait till my next visit! P.S.

We were seated, and waited a very long time for our order to be taken, and another 25 minutes for water, and then 10 more minutes for drinks to arrive. The food took much longer.

We gave ourselves an hour and a half, thinking it would be enough time. I should have known it was not going to be a good experience as soon as I talked to the hostess. She just looked down and with a very passive aggressive demeanor told us the wait time. We took open bar seating since we just planned on getting a drink and some fries. Our waitress comes over with water for two of us, and says she'll be back with one more for our other diner.  So 15 minutes later there's no sign of her and we don't have a lot of time.  We spot a guy in a blue dress shirt by the bar, and naturally assume he's the manager. We wave him over and tell him our orders haven't been taken yet. He just shrugs us off and says our waitress would be right with us. Great,  thanks. She finally shows up and takes our orders.  We get our appetizers a short while later but no drinks. We finish our food and still no drinks. We look over at the bar tender who looks genuinely bewildered. She's pouring beers for people at the bar and standing around with a confused look on her face. We flag down our waitress and ask about the drinks.  She goes to the bar and asks the woman behind the counter then walks away.  They finally come. Mines got a tiny piece of ice floating in it, with a big clump of salt stuck to the side of the glass.

Red Robin has two locations near me in Sunnyvale: the Rivermark area in extreme northeast Santa Clara, or the Saratoga area next to the AMC 14. The only other location is in Eastridge mall San Jose..  Neither of these two locations is really close -about 8 miles each way.  And just try going from my house in south central Sunnyvale to either location during rush hour -it may take you half an hour or longer. There are no Red Robins west of Saratoga for 26 miles -in San Mateo! Now that I'm newly retired, I can take advantage of off times to get my free meals.   I was down in Campbell , and made plans to hit Red Robin in Saratoga, with my newly printed out free birthday meal. You can't just get a birthday meal, but have to join the Red Robin e-mail club, and bring along your 16 digit membership number.  Talk about red tape, the 16 digit number is longer than my 9 digit social security number, and 10 digits would cover every man, woman and child on earth.  They purposely make it long so that if you screw up any one of the 16 digits, you miss out on the free birthday burger.   We get there at 435pm on a Monday, park the Prius, and saunter in, me in my shorts, and my   thin, smoky white, cross strap Birki sandals contrasting against my tennis tanned legs.  And I was overdressed, judging from the clothes or lack of clothes the other guests were wearing. We are served promptly, seated at a cozy table for 2 next to the kitchen, with a view of bumper to bumper traffic on Hamilton Ave(?)  through the windows.  Good ambiance, very clean premises, with waiters all over the place, and teenagers out of school for the summer seemingly in every booth.       Have not been to a Red Robins in years, and it takes us 10 minutes to decide what to order.  All burgers come with unlimited fries.  However I'm not a fan of Red Robin's fries, as they are too chunky and lack the taste of the thin fries.   So the wife and I order our burgers with unlimited salads, at the same price. It takes 20 minutes for our orders to be prepared and served, and this is at 445pm.  Come here an hour later and you may as well use smoke signals to call in your meal!  They don't serve the salads with lettuce, cucumbers, and bits of tomatoes, until the  burgers are ready, and then serve it in a small bowl.  If you want those unlimited salads or fries, you are going to have eat it in small chunks, with long wait times between servings. The wife gets the $10 California chicken burger, complete with lettuce, tomato  and guacamole.  I get the $10 Banzai beef burger, with pineapple, lettuce, tomato.   The burger must be 6"" tall.  Nobody can eat that directly with their mouth.  OK, maybe my ex-wife could fit it into her big mouth, as she put her foot in her mouth way too many times. Messy to eat.  We would look like toddlers with food all over our faces!  Now you know why they provide a knife and fork! I love pineapple with my burgers, but this is seemingly the only place I can get them to put pineapple on my burger, except in Hawaii, where they put pineapple at Island burger in Wailea for $11, and the burger there is half the size with no fries .     So I'm in hamburger heaven here, savoring my Banzai Burger piece by piece, going through two salads.   We leave at 525pm, 50 minutes after entering, with the wallet $15 lighter, thanks to a free birthday burger.   A toddler starts screaming in the background.  Good timing, our leaving!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=60,2.12,2.29,2.632,2.128,2.2220000000000004

After being seated we waited quite a while before we saw our server. She ordered a prime rib burger with tea, and I had the chicken crisp salad with a glass of water. The server dropped the tea and water as he hurried by after a while, but there was no sugar or sweetener on our table or any unoccupied tables nearby. After trying to get the attention of any of the wait staff, it was finally resolved by a trip to the bar and bringing the sweetener back to our table. Interesting that they no longer have sugar, just sweetener. Our food finally arrived and my girlfriend was delivered a french dip sandwich, not the prime rib burger she ordered. The food runner had to go find our server. Can you say: wait another 5 minutes? Of course he said he would take it back and get the right food but by this time we had only a few minutes to get to the movie. He told the manager and when she came by she asked if we wanted the burger, we said no, we have to go to the movie now. Manager asked if we wanted to take it to go. Was she unaware that you can't take food into an AMC theater? Did she think we would leave it in a car for 2 hours to grow bacteria and get all soggy? We deferred her offer to take it to go and she said she was sorry about the mix up. Then, in a tone that came across like she was doing me a favor, she said she would take it off the bill. Duh, did she really think I was going to pay for a burger I never received?

That did not start things off well. I ordered clucks and shrimp and he got a bacon cheeseburger. His burger was underwhelming. My entrée was fine but the fries were cold and sad, do I wanted to get them replaced with fresh ones. This RR location is using ziosk table kiosks, which let you play games, order food and drinks, or call the server. I hit the button to call the server and a red light on top started blinking. And blinking. And blinking. Unfortunately it had no relation to anyone coming to check on us - in fact, several other servers walked by the blinking light and did not acknowledge it at all. We finally, after write a few minutes, saw our server, who brought me new fries. They were hot but also insanely greasy, which was kind of gross.

141,Kevin C.,"San Jose, CA",98,264,114.0,4.0,2015-09-16,"I was first introduced to the Red Robin chain when I was in college.  For a student on a budget, it really checked all the boxes: - free refills on fries - free refills on drinks - reward program (buy 9 entrees, get 1 free) ... Okay, maybe there weren't very many boxes back when my metabolism was faster and my wallet was lighter. More than a decade later, it's still a decent sit-down spot for a diet-busting burger meal.  (I don't dare look at the nutrition facts here.)  The decor got updated a few years ago, and the new chairs are an improvement. The burgers are pretty good: cooked to order, juicy, and piled high.  The Whiskey River BBQ burger is one of our favorites, featuring fried onion strings and barbecue sauce.  The guacamole bacon burger is a self-explanatory classic.  These come with bottomless steak fries (try RR's salty spice mix on them) and run about $10 each. Red Robin now also features a ""Tavern Double"" line of small double cheeseburgers (about $8 each) and a higher-end line of signature burgers on ciabatta buns (about $14 each).  These likewise let you refill fries ad infinitum. The ""freckled"" strawberry lemonade is a popular choice that's been around for years.  The newer ""poppin' purple"" prickly pear lemonade is even sweeter.  These come with free refills, so it's no big surprise that they check in around $4.50 each.  (It would be nice if the beverage menu listed the prices though.) The guest service experience can vary pretty wildly.  On our latest visit, our server Katelynne did an outstanding job and made sure we had everything we needed.  Prompt drink refills, piping-hot fry refills, the works.  She even checked whether we could combine the ""Tavern Double Tuesday"" special with a free birthday burger offer.  Really impressive service, considering she was flying around to cover many tables. On the flip side of things, in that same visit we saw vacated tables neglected for a long time before being bussed.  It honestly seems like the busboys here don't try very hard.  You'd think RR doesn't employ any busboys, but once in a great while they'll come by and bus a table...

Wtf!! All of this while Katelynne is next door chopping away while I flagged her down to check on my burger. She clearly knew my order was screwed up because she only came by to ask where my burger was previously. But with no sense of urgency taking care of the situation, she said she was tired from being up at 6am. Ok, I guess it's ok to not do your job because you're tired.  When the burger came out, I dig in to my burger to only find out that the *ucken 20 min egg that was being cooked, cooked for literally 20 min on the grill. Bit into the burger and what do I bite into? This Caramelized, plastic texture that was from the egg. Ok, at this point, not cool.

Huge onions, crispy and perfectly fried in batter, and most importantly, it tastes so fresh! Only $5 for the small tower or $9 for the large. It's so worth it.  All the burgers that we've tried here have been pretty good. The cod fish burger and whiskey river burger are among my favorites. The burgers are huge and they come with bottomless fries. I'm not a huge fan of their thick cut fries so I normally replace it with a salad.  Most of their appetizers are pretty cheap, they have ones ranging from $3 up to $9.. not bad at all!

I was going to smash burger but I wanted it to be a little more special than just a regular fast food store. We didnt wait for long until we were finally seated. I felt really good having my 2 little brothers with me in the same table. I was asking them how their school was and such. Food was good, my server was very nice too. When we were done eating our meal, I have paid using their tablet and left some tip, walked out then came right back in because I have forgotten my phone. I came back, the reception didnt have my phone so she had to look for my server. When my server came he handed me my phone and underneath it was the tip I had given him, he says ""Heres your money, I dont need it"" turned his head around mugging me. Now what seems to be the problem is that, am i being judged as a person by how much i tip'd? Am I a bad person for not being able to galantly tip like the rich folks do? I mean my sallary is not that great also, Im barely able to get by with what Im getting. I took my brothers to eat despite having a budget, i havent even paid for some of my bills yet, and yet I was made to feel sad just for not tipping him the amount his expecting. I dont think im a cheap person, sometimes when i see homeless people i give them money, or when there is boy scouts/girl scouts I buy their goodies, and sometimes when I can, i treat my family out for dinner. What am i getting at here is that I did not appreciate what my server did, I do hope he's not doing that to any other customers, Im not the type to say fire the guy since we all are in need of a job, but what he did was wrong, and hurtful. Im a nurse and customer service is a must in my profession, receiving gifts, tips or any such is not acceptable. As a nurse we get cursed at, yelled at, and sue'd, or even get our license revoke in worst case scenario, but we still smile because at the end of the day at least were making every person we care for cared for.  I will not be coming back to any other Red Robins Restaurant after this experience. It wasnt a very pleasant experience. Edit: Food was great, my brothers had a fun time. They thanked me for the treat right when I dropped them home. That is very fulfilling to me, as long as my brothers had a good dinner, it is all I could ask.

If it wasn't for the fact that I was sharing with my sister and had to cut it in half, I would not have noticed the fact that the chicken was HALF RAW. This was no little bit of pinkness, it looked as if they completely failed to cook half the chicken. I just don't know how they could have made such a huge mistake.  After discovering this, because service was so slow, it took a while to wave down our server to get this issue fixed. Our waitress was so apologetic--I don't blame her--but honestly I feel like they should have offered to waive our check for this kind of mistake. Instead, they said they would bring me out a new one--they did, but they brought fries instead of onion rings (which I had ordered). I would've let this pass since I felt bad the waitress was so busy, but honestly they were still making me pay the extra so I was going to get my moneys worth. Furthermore, we asked if it was possible to change the channel on the TV. Not a big deal if they wouldn't do it, but the problem was that they said they would and they never did. Not very happy about that either. In the end, the food was decent, and our waitress did try to make things up for us by being more attentive after the incident. However, I personally believe that there shouldn't have been this problem in the first place. Imagine if I hadn't shared with my sister, I would've just eaten the chicken raw...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=80,1.84,2.21,2.308,1.8600000000000003,2.0620000000000003

179,Alison ..,"Santa Clara, CA",5,162,6.0,2.0,2016-09-14,"I'm disappointed with this location.  Seeing my older review from 2014 on Yelp was actually helpful, a good reminder of that experience shows the place is hit or miss.  This place isn't always the best choice. Mediocre is the right label. My husband and I have gone to this location on numerous visits, but, the next time we want Red Robin, it will have to be the Rivermark location. The next time I'm near Westgate, I'll strongly consider other dining options. Our visit was tonight- Wednesday, Sept. 14th at 8:00.  We were seated in the coldest area of the restaurant- the central area near the window.  I asked if we could relocate- We normally sit near the bar, during afternoon hours.  When our waitperson (Jessica) asked what we wanted, my husband suggested that I needed a jacket. Jessica tells me the manager is busy in the kitchen, but will get to it when they get the chance.  It would have been nice if this mythical manager actually stopped by and acknowledged that there was a problem.  Our food came, and the fries were cold with my Arctic Cod burger.  My husband ordered fish and chips- the fish was soggy, and the four small pieces were buried in his cold fries.   Food would be classified as warm, but not hot.  Service was not stellar-it was okay, but, we only saw our server when she took our order and brought the food to the table.  We were near a semi-large group. It really wasn't that busy.  There were three people working at the maitre'd station, mostly having a conversation amongst themselves. It took awhile to get a refill on the drinks, and the replacement for the cold fries only came AFTER we finished our meals.  Same for drink refills. As far as observations on restaurant cleanliness, I noticed the tables outside that needed to be bussed when we came in, still needed attention as we were leaving.   As far as sitting at that cold table, I don't understand why we had to sit at that specific table other than the fact that table was in the zone for that waitperson. That situation could have been resolved in a personable fashion over the excuse of ""We'll get to it when we can"".   My guess is that the system cannot be adjusted.  My problem with this place is that I've had better experiences at this location.   Much better.  Enough that I normally ignore that the value of the food is overpriced for what is received.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=140,2.12,2.25,2.292,2.088,2.1980000000000004

Even better, you get unlimited refills. Though I don't think you'll really need more than one or two refills because the meal was really filling.

Unfortunately, it's not the burgers :( I love coming here just to scarf on those little fingers of crispy carbs. This particular location is right across from Westgate Mall and was busy, but not packed when I arrived with my daughter for a late lunch on a Saturday afternoon. We walk in and see the hostess moving at a snail's pace to get menus and escort a couple to their table. She looked at me and my first thought was, ""Wow, is she in SLOW-MO?."" Literally. She didn't greet us, didn't smile, or even say she'd be with us in a moment, she just blankly looked at us with an open mouth then very slowly turned away and started leisurely walking away. Even the couple following her to their table looked at each other befuddled at her sloth-like pace. Fortunately, at that moment another gentleman (likely a server) saw me with my jaw on the floor and said, ""Oh sorry, let me help you get seated, table for 2?"" So glad someone else came to seat us, or else we could have possibly been waiting quite some time for the hostess to slowly come back. We sat down and ordered our food. Food took a bit longer than expected to arrive.  Overall, it was the experience I expected. Good fries, OK burger, and service that you neither give kudos to nor complain about.

117,Marlina M.,"San Jose, CA",1,8,,2.0,2016-10-17,"So Red Robin is not by any means a 'new' dining experience for me, and probably most of us out there, as it is not a new restaurant. What is new to me is the overall decline of customer service that has been sadly occurring in many like places (Buffalo Wild Wings, Mimis, Chilis, etc). My review is not about the food, because the food here is greasy good - so good in fact that after three consecutive bad trips I still have voted to go back for the promise of endless seasoned steak fries.  But lets talk about that for a minute - lets talk about the 'bottomless fries' premise. Now I don't know about you but when I hear the catch phrase 'bottomless fries' I am pretty excited and really do think I am about to do some real potato damage. The best part of that aside from the taste, is the fact that it is going to not only be an endorsed process but one that is facilitated with speed and ease for my consumption pleasure. But bottomless fry seekers beware....such is not the case. Red Robin has actually found the ingenious formula of attracting customers with the sly fry claim while gently folding in some basic satiating know-how. What ever you had in mind about bottomless fries let me tell you what actually happens. Your burger will arrive to the table with your first side of fries that is usually served in a little tea cup size metal 'holder' meant to jazz up the presentation and keep the fry portion to a minimum. Keep in mind these are steak fries so they take up some room. All said and done, you get a burger with roughly the amount of fries it takes to fill up a toddler. Then your server walks away leaving you fry-less by burger bite 4 and you are in your mind thinking ""Its ok that she hasn't came back yet and Im almost done eating - they are bottomless"". Minutes will start to overlap and you are now fully done with your burger and your drink is gone (long gone if you have a man that drinks like mine does) in desperate need of a refill. Finally just before you contemplate asking another waitress if you can get help your server will return and you will ask for more fries. Five minutes later they will return with a wire basket containing 10 fries all laid out flat on the serving basket to give the appearance of being full. Now if something is such a big selling point for you, like oh I dont know.....fries, then wouldn't you have a whole lot of fry action going on in the kitchen? My point is that even with the initial disappearance of your server once you do ask for the fries shouldn't they be there in way less than 5 min? Enter the trickery of the fry catch. By intentionally making you wait for the fries by spacing out the arrival of the fries one of two things is going to happen. One, your stomach will cue the brain that the parties over and you are full or two you are just going to get tired of waiting for fries in increments of 10. And just like that they have served you one or two servings of fries, making good on that bottomless promise.  But that was a rant and not even what this review is about - ok so basically here it is quickly. The service is just plain bad. Your server really does disappear on you and often your needs are just not met. On Saturday we went in early at about 5pm and were seated within about 5 min. We then sat at our table for about 17 min watching employees walk around, make small talk by the drink machine and seat other guests who had their beverages on the table within minutes. My husband wanted to go but I wanted to see who was actually supposed to be our server. Low and behold it was someone that walked by us countless times. Now I understand  being busy, so much so that the simple ""I'll be right with you"" would have shut  me up but over 10 min? I mean come on. So our server finally approaches and I just asked if I could talk to the manager. I know - I have become that person lol.....anyways she walks away, goes up to the manager and I see her laughing a little with him cause you know, that's always cool to do, and then he comes to the table. I told him what happened and that we were just going to leave but that he should be aware of what is happening on his watch - not that he seemed to care much. He then tells me to wait a minute because he wanted to give me a coupon for 'next time'. He then comes back with two 'Free $3 or $5 appetizer coupons' which was nice of him but basically means I can get fried jalapeno coins or the chips & salsa, and if you have ever had those here can probably agree should be free as it is so.....yeah. It was just a bummer all around having to get my newborn (not the easiest task) and go to a different place.  Case in point: If you want a burger really bad that is not from a drive through, have extra time, no kids, like being ignored and don't really like fries this place will work for you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=100,2.36,2.37,2.296,1.9600000000000002,2.366

Your then seated and ignored for another 15 minutes as the crew walks by you multiple times looking but not making eye contact as if amongst themselves they are deciding who is going to get stuck with you.Its like when your in school and your picking teams for a sport and it's down to you and the other kid who is not really good and they just settle for you.If your privileged enough to be served high five yourself!!!

The second meal was sent back because gluten free was ordered due to allergies and that's not what she got.  Her new meal showed up when the rest of us were almost finished.  However, the worst thing about the meals were the fries.  They were awful, hard and dry.  We asked for a new batch of fries and was told that ""they are all that way, we are having a problem with the supplier"".  Well, the fries are why we go to Red Robin.  I don't know why they would serve fries that they knew were bad.  I think they should have told us prior to ordering that they were having problems with the fries.  We could have ordered something else, like onion rings.  So, we didn't eat much of the ""all you can eat fries"" because they were inedible.  Also, just about when we were about to leave, our server asked if we wanted refills on our drinks.  By then, we just wanted to leave.  This has to be the worst experience we've had at Red Robin.  None of us are planning to go back anytime soon.  By the way, I did send an email to the corporation regarding the awful fries.  Their response, ""we will forward the email to the manager"".  That's the last I've heard.  So, the restaurant management doesn't care and neither does the corporation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=300,2.36,2.3,2.28,1.924,2.324

Started dinner off today by missing our name being called, apparently they ""yelled it three times"" but somehow my late-twenties ears missed these clear and well-enunciated calls. The part that got to me wasn't that they didn't make an effort to find us but that there was absolutely no apology- or anything remotely resembling an apology in response. Once we were re-added to the list, we were brought in fairly quickly. We immediately met our server, Ryan, who has so far been SUPER nice, getting us multiple drink refills and checking in on us frequently. The food here is mediocre, complex flavors and seasoning being replaced by cheese and bacon. The cocktails and alcohol-containing milkshakes contain very little alcohol and a lot of sugar.  So why, you ask, would I choose to come here rather than any of the gourmet burger options offered in the Bay Area? I have a very good reason: the steak fries and freckled lemonade. For someone who mocks the addition of sugar in all of our food, I cannot stop myself from ordering a freckled lemonade. Sometimes (today) they add less sugar and it is slightly sour and delicious. Other times it is diabetes in a cup, but every single time it is exactly what I want. They make it with vodka too but I haven't tried it; why mess with perfection?  Now the steak fries: I'm pretty sure they contain recreational drugs as a seasoning (can I say crack on yelp?) Every few months I CRAVE these amazing bits of salty goodness smothered in ranch dressing (I clearly have a very refined palate) and these fries are the actual reason I will ALWAYS come back to Red Robin.

First, our order was wrong and mistakes happen but when I ask for something that was missing in my burger it shouldn't take 20 minutes to get onion slices. Also, we asked for a refill of fries and I had to ask twice and they were not even the garlic fries we ordered. This is such a disgrace for what Red Robin is suppose to represent. As I am eating I don't want to see a creepy two eyed weirdo massage multiple girls on the line. Seriously so gross. If people have cold food it's because servers are too busy not doing their job. This is the worst Red Robin ever. If I could leave no stars I would do so. It's not just our tables order that was wrong but the tAble next to ours was incorrect and they look irritated. I would like to add if there is food in the window you need to run it out!!!! Management you need to crack down and make sure people are doing their jobs correctly unless you are getting a massage from the creepy server on which that can be sexual harassment.

32,Bryan W.,"Sunnyvale, CA",1107,1018,2609.0,4.0,2017-07-26,"When you were a kid (assuming you aren't any longer), did you ever have such a dreadful experience at a restaurant that you promised yourself you wouldn't eat there again? To me, that experience was at Red Robin Gourmet Burgers. When I was in middle school (or was it high school??), I had eaten at the Red Robin near my house for the very first time; I really didn't like their burgers one bit and decided I would never visit a Red Robin ever again. The only positive thing out of that experience was that they had decent fries.  Fast forward about 10 years and I've kept up my promise to avoid Red Robin. But that all changed when I decided to give it another try since my girlfriend got a free deal through their birthday rewards (basically if it's your birthday month, you can get any free burger from ""gourmet burger"" section). We ended up going to the one in San Jose. The Red Robin Gourmet Burgers that we went to was on El Paseo de Saratoga within the Westgate shopping plaza. Since it's a huge mall, there should always be plenty of parking. Getting here is also very easy because the plaza is nearby major streets (like San Tomas Expressway and Saratoga). I recommend coming slightly before you get hungry because wait times can be long. Even though it was a Monday night around 630pm, we had to wait approximately 15 minutes before getting in. And it would also take us around 20 minutes to actually get our food.  If you have never been to Red Robin Gourmet Burgers before, this restaurant is another one of those big burger chains that you see on T.V. and everywhere you go. As the name suggests, this restaurant specializes in fat, juicy burgers with a variety of different ingredients. Their burgers are split between the classic gourmet burgers (like the guac bacon and the original), and their finest burgers (fancier burgers with ingredients like arugula). In terms of pricing, Red Robin is a bit more expensive than most burger chains for what you get (more on that later), but one reason why people keep coming is because of their unlimited steak fries (they come with each meal and you can substitute for other type of fries for more $$). I ended up getting the Burnin' Love and my girlfriend got the Guacamole Bacon. -Burnin' Love (6/10). First off, I give props to Red Robin for actually putting some spice in this burger. Usually, most restaurants are flaky with their ""spicy"" burgers, but this one packed some heat. I love the idea of frying the jalapenos and placing one right on top of the burger. However, the burger falls really short: The patty was super small and not that juicy. It looked and tasted more like a charbroiled diner style burger (something you see at In n Out), which was disappointing as it should have been bigger. Plus, they don't have a medium rare option! And furthermore, the lettuce was very, very meh. They used sliced lettuce which probably came from a giant pack. Why not use a large slice of iceberg lettuce? I mean you clearly have some if it's on your wedgie burger picture? But all in all, this wasn't a ""bad"" burger per say. I feel like it didn't meet my low expectations.  -Guac Bacon (7/10). Though the Guac Bacon burger has the same shortcomings as the above, at least they had a very large helping of guac to make up for the meh patty. I love the bacon in there, even though it wasn't crispy. All in all, I probably would've gotten this one instead. Or maybe the swiss mushroom..  -Steak Fries (9/10). To be honest, I'd probably come to Red Robin just for their steak fries. They are HUGE, super crispy, and warm. I recommend getting a refill/second batch because those are much hotter and crispier. That's because when you get your burger, the fries have been sitting since it takes longer to make a burger than fries. Thus, get the second batch!! All in all, I have to rate the food quality at Red Robin 3 stars at best. It was probably just as I'd remembered it as a kid. HOWEVER, the biggest redeeming factor of this place was the hella good service. First off, the waitress/waiter who were both serving us were super kind; they kept asking if everything was okay. They also processed our checks very fast. And second, the boss was SO HELPFUL for getting my phone out of the little crevice in the bench where I dropped it in. I was a bit distressed since I always do this to myself, but he was very kid to me. He jokingly asked for a $100 tip, and if I had that money, maybe I would. So for that, I end up giving Red Robin a ""nice-su, you can take your parents here and they'll be happy."" TBH my parents would probably be okay with this since they love good service. But if you want the creme de la creme of burgers, this Red Robin (or any for that matter) is not for you.

Came with two of my friends around 7:30-8:00, hoping for a good bite. We ordered two appetizers being the onion rings and the chips and dip. Both came out fairly quick and was super satisfying. About my meal, I had the french onion soup as well as the Garden Burger (got the veggie patty but you can opt out for the vegan boca). Can't say I remember the prices of my meal but it was phenomenal. The French onion was super creamy with the amounts of melted cheese that was on top and the veggie burger tasted healthier than I expected. Woo-hoo! I also ended up signing up for the Red Robin's rewards system which seemed to have great perks as you build up your criteria. Plus a free burger on your birthday month!

From the time we ordered to the time we were served, it took at least twenty minutes to see our server who told me the ice tea machine was having issues, it would be a few more minutes to get some tea. When she brought it to me it was like dirty water and had little to no tea flavor. But said it would get me started. I was not impressed.  Then our burgers came, the fries were ice cold and the burgers were like warm. Furthermore if you go into a place and they ask you for temp on a burger (some pink or no pink as the ask) than if you ask for some pink you should get what you order especially when the place is not busy. But instead my burger was cooked all the way through. A server there that we know got us one of the managers. They said they could remake. But we figured it took 30 minutes to get in the first place we were not going to wait another 30 minutes. Let alone pay for food we didn't order.  I mean how hard is it when you first open to not have the right food and drink ready and waiting. Is it a lack of training, lack of standards or a pure lack of leadership. That's why you have regs and checklists. If someone is running late it can mess up the whole team. Maybe schedule your crew fifteen minutes earlier to make sure things are done right. The manager gave us coupons for two apps, is that really a good standard. Besides taking care of our food for that day, he should have taken the time to get our names and take down our concern.  He invited us back but didn't give us his card. A little unpersonal if you ask me. Not a good lasting impression. 11/28/17 Went back today to give them a second chance. Huge mistake! I am not certain where the lack of training is coming from or even the pride of ownership of ones duties. But even after telling the server exactly how we wanted our meals, there was some type of breakdown either from the Manager who was in the kitchen actually cooking our burgers or the server who put in the ticket. They were not very busy so there should not have been any mistakes. My fiancé ordered a tavern burger with cheddar cheese and no sauce. Yet the burger came to us with American cheese and sauce all over the bottom bun. Her second burger can back with the bun soaked in grease, one patty that was charded to hell and back and a top bun that was all ripped up. Obviously they pitched the bottom bun and patty and did them over, scrapped the cheese off the top patty and just recheesed it. Then tried to heat the bun up on the flat top. What a fucking joke!! Plus the fries they sent out weren't even hot, and looked like ones left over from an earlier batch that had been sitting a while.  I got the Royal Red burger. The nice picture shows it with a sunny side up nice looking egg. What I got was a broken yolk chard flat egg with burn bottom and edges. Plus if a server asks you if you want some pink to the patty, you would expect some pink. Not the hockey puck that I got. I sent it back and still got a well done patty but the egg was sunny side up with a burnt bottom and edges. Which is a true indicator the cook did the egg in a hurry over high heat. I did not have the time or fortitude to wait a third time and told the server to just remove it. And I got my meal with a side salad instead of fries, but could only eat part of it because the lettuce was rusted and the green leaf was wilted. Two things you never want to see I. Your salad greens.  We got up from our table and asked to see the manager. We waited up front far too long and walked out. ""Larry"" the manager said he made our food but he was confused. Not what I would want to hear from a person who is supposed to be in charge. Told us to come back sometime for a burger on him. But not sure that's a risk I want to take again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=20,2.56,2.27,2.252,,2.386
26,Janet P.,"San Jose, CA",1,36,9.0,2.0,2017-12-02,We went at 11:20 on a Saturday to beat the rush. Very disappointed in the service. The person who seated us took her sweet time (and it was not busy) and our server acted like he was being bothered. He was even sarcastic when I asked him a question about the menu. Food - good - not great. I can't imagine what it would be like in here when busy.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose?start=20,2.6,2.28,2.252,,2.408
3,an l.,"San Jose, CA",90,188,283.0,1.0,2017-12-12,"I don't even know how this place remains opens. The staff seemed more concerned with socializing with the cooks than serving the customers. We were seated at 835pm. Had to click ask for server on their touch screen at 845. At 850 she came and said sorry. Ordered and since we were starving, we asked if we could have our fries first. It's 905 and we still have not had any food delivered to our table especially the fries that we asked for first. When our food was finally brought to us, we were given no utensils, no napkins, no ketchup. Our waitress stated she would bring it right to us and we watched her go take another order to the bar, check on two other tables before she brought us anything.  There were only four other tables in the restaurant at the time we were there. Onto the food. Our fries were cold and the burgers were soggy from too much sauce. It wasn't the burgers I was used to eating at Red Robin years ago. I've never been so disappointed in a burger ever. This was worst than a Carl's Jr. burger.  Sure enough she never checked back in on us. We paid on the little kiosk they have at the table which takes away the whole food ""service"" aspect of working in a restaurant. I guess the up side of being able to pay at the table is we didn't have to flag down the waitress who didn't do anything other than bring our food to us. She did not deserve a tip and Red Robin did not deserve us as patrons. One star is more than what this place deserves. Last but not least, I checked my email receipt and was charged 1.99 for entertainment center which we did no use for any sort of entertainment other than paying. This place is a scam.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose,2.6,2.28,2.248,,2.408
2,Brandon Y.,"San Jose, CA",827,615,1134.0,2.0,2017-12-13,"Solid 2.5 stars - went here for ma's b-day because she loves the bottomless fries, though overall nothing really stood out too much. At over $11 for a burger, even though they are 1/2 pound burgers, I expected a bit more. We got the chips and guac appetizer, which didn't really feature that many chips or that much salsa/guac, and it took a while to get more fries and pay, despite the digital menu device blinking. Overall, I feel like Red Robin has potential, but there would need to be an improvement in quantity of food and service that would make me more inclined to visit more often.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose,2.6,2.29,2.244,,2.414
7,Melissa M.,"Campbell, CA",0,30,4.0,1.0,2017-12-19,"Burgers are usually pretty good. The rest of it, not impressed. Arrived around 11:15 to an empty restaurant and a 15 minute wait. Not a good start. Was starving, so ordered quickly, and added a salad so we could have something to munch on while we waited. That was a waste, as it showed up with the rest of our meal. Couldn't get our waiter's attention to save my life. Good luck getting bottomless fries. Asked for medium well burger, it was raw.  I understand s*#! happens, but this has been the experience I've had for at least the past few visits and I'm over it. Didn't bother mentioning anything to the manager because I did during my last visit and he was defensive, rude and dismissive.

Our waiter, I forgot his name, was very attentive and patient with us and always asked if we needed anything. My review is missing a star because the food quality has went down over the years.

We had been sitting for 40 minutes and our waitress hadn't even introduced herself. They said they were busy but there was only 2 other full tables in our section. This is pretty much the worst service I've had. Waiters were on their phones, walking slowly and joking around with their employees. We were about two minutes away from walking out when we finally received our food. I like this restaurant, please get better employees though.

They provide you with these tablets for request Service and paying ect. But when you ask for service all it does is flash... like if they can't see me waving my damn hands how will they see the little red light. Other than the disappointing service the food was ok.  They got my order wrong,  also the fries where a bit cold.

S/O and I were looking for something to eat before we head into REI. Came around 2:30 and the place wasn't packed. We had to wait about 10 min to get seated. We waited another 10 minutes for someone to take our order.  Our waitress was really nice though, so that's a plus. S/O ordered the Burnin' Love Burger with onion rings. He finished his meal quick so it's safe to say that he likes it. I ordered the chicken burger with garlic fries. I liked the garlic fries more than my burger, so that says something. Each table has it's own mini tablet where you are able to order games and pay for your meal with a card. It's easy peasy to use if you will. Otherwise, bring enough cash + tip so you can walk out quick.

13,Steven S.,"Los Gatos, CA",0,6,,2.0,2018-01-01,"For a self professed gourmet burger joint with unlimited fries, this visit failed on both counts.  The first two angus burgers ordered medium rare arrived well done with a very small number of cold fries on the side.  While we waited for a redo on the burgers another order of fries arrived cold and dry again.  Second burgers were better but closer to medium and edges were crispy singed.  The final fries attempt came very hot but the potato centers were not meaty and flaky but weirdly creamy.   Dessert guys?  No thanks!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-san-jose,2.32,2.25,2.252,,2.278
0,Sparky Jr. D.,"San Jose, CA",2,42,133.0,3.0,2018-01-04,"Sorry I have to do this, Red Robin. I've been a pretty consistent fan of this restaurant for the last three years for its cheap prices and friendly staff. The food has always been okay; no complaints there. Not too long ago, the staff was very attentive and bottomless fries still existed! Now, good luck tracking down your server for napkins or a refill on those ""bottomless"" fries and root beer floats you paid for.  I appreciate the efforts our server made today to at least acknowledge our presence after 10 minutes of being seated, but the fact that it took him 20 minutes since we were seated to actually put in our order shows how understaffed this restaurant is. Our server was running around to so many other tables I couldn't even keep track. I don't blame him, but I do hope that this restaurant gets him some more help and other employees on the floor. Additional stars given for Daphne, Tiffany and Steven. I've never seen such enthusiastic workers and despite the wait time that comes frequently when dining here, I've always enjoyed their service and appreciate their hard work.
