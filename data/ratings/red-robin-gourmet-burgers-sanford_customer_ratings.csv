We were here on its second day open & it was packed. No wait, however.  Plenty of servers & bus boys to keep things moving. The food came out fresh & quick & was delicious! Hubby got the Bonzai burger ( his favorite). I got the DGB & it was awesome!  We will be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-sanford?start=40,3.124,3.124,3.124,3.124,3.124

114,Jeanne H.,"Lake Mary, FL",0,7,,5.0,2014-03-07,"We are Pacific Coasters that live here in Sanford now, so of course we love Red Robin. We were so excited to see they were opening right down the street! We sat at the bar (our usual spot) where Adrienne gave us excellent service. We just had appetizers and drinks because we wanted to get as much of ""home"" as possible. We had cheese sticks that are the best in the country, and yes, I would put money on it. The only weird thing is that they break the ice cream machine down at 3 PM so from 3 to about 4 you can't get an ice cream drink. I've never seen a restaurant do that before, it's not worth taking a star away but it's something they might to change. Overall a great place to have a bite, a drink and a little fun!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-sanford?start=100,3.124,3.124,3.124,3.124,3.124

The raspberry limeade was really good and the sweet potato fries too;) The kids menu its kid friendly and  has many choices for side items.  Definitely going back soon ti try some of their beer.  The atmosphere its nice they have a bar and special area for adults without kids. The waiting time was 30 min and the y text u to confirm your table is ready for you. The only negative point its that they didn't have any coloring pages for the kids, but the food price and quality and customer service make up for it.

I had the guac and bacon burger, my husband had the Red Robin special and my grand daughter had a bacon cheeseburger. The burger were just okay. We ordered the Berry Limeade which tasted terrible, it tasted like seltzer water, not much flavor at all. The fries tasted like the frozen steak fries that Ore-Ida makes. We thought it was kind of pricey for the kind of food they serve. Save money by going to Steak and Shake, the burgers are much better there and they cost less. The service was great though. We did not have to wait long even though it was packed. We will not be going back.

Our server Jessica went above and beyond to keeps the kids and adults happy and the bottomless fries full! We tried the BBQ chicken salad, blue cheese burger, DGB, fish and chips and a few other entrees and they were all good! For appetizers the wings are yummy and sticky, the fresh kettle chips crunchy and the pretzel bites pretty good but the onion ring stack was the best!!

85,Sarah F.,"Orlando, FL",188,101,4.0,3.0,2014-03-17,"The second time we were here we also had friendly, fast service. My food wasn't quite as good--the Banzai Burger isn't marinated in teriyaki sauce as the menu describes; instead the bottom bun is slathered in it. It tasted like a standard supermarket jarred sauce, and overwhelmed the pineapple and cheese. The patty wasn't very high quality, either; more fast food type than restaurant burger.  The water, as one other reviewer noted, is undrinkable. I guess that's one way to force your patrons to purchase a beverage but really, Red Robin, buy a filter.  Overall it was still a pleasant experience and in all likelihood we will return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-sanford?start=60,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003,2.8600000000000003

I had the RED'S TAVERN DOUBLE BURGER for the first time. It was great!! Cook perfectly!! I also had the sweet potato fries for the first time - I won't get them again. They didn't taste like sweet potato fires. That is not why this review did not get a 5 star - it mostly has to do with the waitress. She was never to be found. When it was time for more fries, could not find her. When she did come by, she asked us how we were doing as she is briskly walking by. My drink was never refilled and my girlfriend's drink was only refilled after I caught the waitress as she was running by. I understand that the restaurant has only been open a week, but I would have hoped that Red Robin would have trained their staff better than that. Hopefully the next time is better or I will be driving 45 minutes away to the only other Red Robin in the State of Florida I know of.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-sanford?start=120,2.9600000000000004,2.9600000000000004,2.9600000000000004,2.9600000000000004,2.9600000000000004

The food is okay,I had the fish (cod)sandwich with fries and coleslaw on the side. The fish slides off the bread because the bread is so soft and they put tomatoes with the fish,taste why good except for the fries which tasted like frozen French fries or over cooked. The slaw looked dry. My girl had a avocado salad that comes with eggs and black olives,avocado,tomatoes and blue cheese and offcourse your choice of dressing.The salad was good and had plenty of everything but avocados but taste wise it was delicious and huge. Service Is okay and even though we came late on a Friday. The place is cool looking inside and has lots pictures above you and around.

It's pretty new, clean, nicely decorated, friendly staff...we both ordered a gourmet cheeseburger and some of their bottomless fries. The only real complaint I have about this place is that the food took forever to come out so I highly suggest you order an appetizer while you wait. The burgers were fantastic, however! Whenever I get a burger at any other restaurant, I usually don't finish it but I ate every single last bite of this one, I definitely want to go back and try more of their items because they had a large menu.

Anyway, they first gave us a table in the ""21 and over"" area which is just dumb, so we had to wait a few more minutes for another table. Service was a little slow but the server was very friendly.  I asked for just a regular cheeseburger with usual toppings, lettuce, tomato, ketchup, pickle. I got a burger with cheese and ketchup only! I asked for medium-well but the burger was medium-rare.

The food was pretty good, but not the service.   Hate to say it got awkward-but it did.  We had one server take our drink order then disappear for a while. Then another server came over after a while and started over again with our drink order. At the same time the first server came back to our table. Our new (current server) was sharp and was making it clear to the original server that this was her table. Just a bit uncomfortable, but I guess those things happen. When I asked our new server if our drinks were still coming she said (kind of annoyed at me), ""well you can just tell me your drink order again"". Somehow I felt like we were getting blamed for the server confusion happening here? It was weird. The new server had issues with taking our order and couldn't get some menu options correct. We had to read to her from the menu and she said ""well I don't know, the menu changes so often"". Again, not really our issue, she was just getting aggravated with us for clarifying our ordered items. When I asked for silverware and napkins we again got a smirk and were told ""I'm getting them"". It was obvious this server was in a sour mood and having a bad day.  Our food was okay, but after this experience it's likely I would never go back.

It was just funny to me because the restaurant is decor is LOUD and fun, but our server was the total opposite. There was definitely a stark contrast in personalities between our server and the roaming manager who had such a warm personality! It's okay though because although quiet, our server gave us prompt service.  I forgot the name of the burger I ordered, but it had the look of a big mac and the taste of a whopper. So, I guess if the big mac and the whopper had a union, then their byproduct ended up at Red Robin? My companion ordered the bacon on bacon burger with an extra topping of a sunny side up egg. He enjoyed his choice!  I think the highlights for me were the onion rings, steak fries, and my Blue Moon milkshake.  It was the perfect drinkable dessert that reminded me of an orange creamsicle, but with a blue moon aftertaste.

It had egg, bacon and cheese on it and it was completely different than what I normally get as a burger. I upgraded to the garlic fries, I was really surprised how good they were.  We sat in the bar. The bartender was very friendly and changed the channel to the game we were hoping to see. We were served quickly and the order was correct. They have a full bar. I went with a seasonal draft, but there are also a good number of selections on their menu.  The only negative to this experience was the bathroom. It was covered in toilet paper everywhere, including the seats and floor. There was a bucket and backed up toilet in one stall. The hand towels were not in place and there was stuff all over. That certainly made me lose my appetite a bit.  Overall, a good experience. I believe it might have been much better if the place was cleaner.

I'm not much of a red meat fan but when I crave a good burger, Red Robbins is one of my top picks. I've tried their beef burgers, cod sandwiches, and vegan/vegetarian option patties. All very delicious and worth eating again. My favorite on their menu would have to be their cod sandwich. I'm a big fish fan and the crisp and buttery taste of their cod is very on point - must try if you like white meat fish. Favorite appetizer are their pretzel bites with beer cheese. Their wings are very good too. I often opt for their sweet potato fries but I've had their garlic herb fries too which are good but are thick cut, which I don't mind having but would prefer thin cut fries. Service here could be better.  Everyone is nice and does their job but here isn't anything about their service that stands them apart from other places. Every server I've encountered here seem either depressed, monotoned, or just simply does not want to be there.

Really you can't warm them up?  There was quite a bit of the lemon oil as well. Making the burger over oily. The burger was cooked medium and was flavorful.  The overall combination of ingredients aside from cold tomatoes was incredible. The cod fish was just the right amount and not greasy. The fish was tender and had a good bite to it.  The fries were tender and creamy yet crisp.  I did notice that our server was given quite a few tables and could not keep up with check backs.

It is awesome that they serve beer since I have a husband. Great place to go when you don't want to be in a sports bar environment but you would love a Burger, wings or a good salad and your husband wants beer. Lol. I had a beer with my husband and it was very cold which is a good thing. I absolutely recommend the garlic Parmesan fries they are to die for. Also if burgers and wings are not your thing. They have amazing fish and chips. This fish and chips were plentiful, fresh and crunchy yet, not overcooked. When I go to a restaurant I can always tell if their oil is too hot or if the oil is old. I can taste it in the food. I have never had this problem at this restaurant. If you have children and a husband I highly recommend this place for you. I would recommend this place for anybody.

Told him to tell his cooks to wear head cover over their long hair that wasn't put up. Even the manager working in the back cooking wasn't wearing any head cover.

3,Chantel H.,"Eustis, FL",109,133,65.0,2.0,2017-04-29,"1. Food was inconsistent. My wedge salad had virtually no crispy onion strings whilst my sister's salad had a plethora. I asked for more and was given a big portion of them at no upcharge. Unfortunately, on top of being overly greasy and somewhat soggy, they were EXTREMELY salty. I love salty things, I never complain about salt, so to say these were too salty means they were too salty. Like caked-in-salt salty tasting.  2. BBQ veggie burger was flavorful, but it came out to us warm. Not hot. Sat like a brick in my stomach. The onion strings came as a topping and were still oh soooo salty. 3. Was not offered a refill on the ""bottomless"" steak fries. Didn't ask because I kept expecting to be offered a refill? Because they ALWAYS do. But alas, never got it.  4. The side of steamed broccoli i ordered was DRY as a mother, brown and withered in some spots, and had an unpleasant flavor. Not broccoli you would expect at a RESTAURANT--maybe something you'd a leftover container you'd forgotten in the back of your fridge for 3 weeks.  5. Was not given enough silverware. Two forks and only one knife. Was not checked on enough to ask for another knife, so we shared a knife to cut our wedge salads haha  6. We waited what seemed like 15-20 minutes to be seen by a server after we'd been seated.  I haven't been to this Red Robin, or any Red Robin location for that matter, in 2 years, but I remember it being so fresh and so good.  This experience makes me think I may wait indefinitely to come back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-sanford,3.0,3.22,3.22,,3.1320000000000006

We tried Red Robin today and agree the burger was good, average at best but we found the menu overwhelming and very pricey. We are foodies and are willing to pay for food and service levels, we are not penny pinchers. The sweet potato fries were mediocre and the garlic parm steak fries dry and unappealing. Again Zinburger has fabulous sweet potato fries. I was also irritated by an add on price for something other than plain steak fries. Our server never mentioned a price difference when I asked about alternatives. The sweet tea was tasteless too.

55,Evan M.,"Sanford, FL",0,9,,2.0,2017-05-29,"Red Robin needs to step up their game to differentiate itself from many of the below average burger joints in Sanford. The service was pretty fast. We ordered a small Tavern burger and a side of macaroni. The burger was soggy and tasteless. The fries were hot and crispy as ordered. The food took 12 minutes.  The server was a bit of an airhead. We were seated up front on a table that was too small for both of us right next to the hostess podium.  Perfect for watching the servers stand around and talk. When there were customers noone to be seen. To bad we ordered another tavern burger to go earlier. Again soggy and it came with seven, yes 7, french fries. I forgot to mention the fake processed cheese on the burgers. SHAME ON YOU RED ROBIN. Why not cut down on your cutesy advertisements on tv and serve some real food that has some taste to it.

As for the service much needs to be desired, my server was pleasant but didn't get my order right i asked for broccoli and got mandarins, my daughter asked for just a couple of pieces of ice in her drink and she got mostly ice in her drink. When we tried to get a servers attention we were purposely ignored which happened with two different servers as they walked by looked at us raising our hands at a futile attempt to get their attention. I have never been so openly ignored in my face as a paying customer I have to say this was a sad day.

Last time again in back. I could see if they were busy...first time I sat at the bar you would think my service there would be amazing... guess what she was in the back chatting half the time too...today's server took about five minutes to get to my table...guess where she was?

I ordered fries as soon as I sat and I didn't get them... waitress is talking to the manager about things.... apparently the whole crew including management is very slackadaisical... food has been good but service is so horrible....oh and vet order coffee..who charges $2.99 for a cup of coffee??? today Marie was my waitress...my waitress and the hostess were all on their cell phones instead of taking care of customers..just awful.....I don't remember the last waitresses name  but this will be my last visit to this location unless someone else wants to go!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-sanford,2.76,3.12,3.12,,2.9760000000000004

For the price and what I got is fair. I'm not sure if it was due to the fact that I took it to go but the bun was a little soggy. Also for the smoky jack - I was expecting a little more kick to the burger. I think they forgot to put in the BBQ. I saw the campfire sauce on there. Overall, it was ok. The steak fries were soggy and could of used a little salt on it. Only ate a handful of them. It did satisfy the burger craving that I was having and the $6.99 price is certainly fair.

The people in the booth next to me said they had never seen anything like this & don't they care about us?  There were also 3 tables filled with dirty dishes that were not cleaned right next to us over this period.  The female manager came over and asked what the problem was & I explained that perhaps in this tough economic environment a little courtesy should be should to a customer.  I explained that I was an analyst for the industry & stated that I would probably be giving a poor review.  She stated she did not like to be threatened - I explained that I was simply stating that this was not good for her company.  She never came back to the table,the meal was fine, and the check for $55 was given with no other comment, other than to ""have a nice day"".  I paid it, and implore anyone interested in investing in Red Robin International of Colorado to not do it.  I am giving a downgrade rating of the chain to our investors.  There are many better chains whom like customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-sanford?start=40,2.64,3.09,3.09,,2.9099999999999997
