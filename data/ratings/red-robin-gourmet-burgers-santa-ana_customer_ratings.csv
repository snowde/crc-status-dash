Their Red Robin Gourmet cheeseburger, Banzai burger and the Whiskey River BBQ chicken wrap are delicious. These are a few of my favorite items. I usually only order ranch for my fries, but this time our server brought honey mustard and the other is called Campfire? Not sure, but they were yummy. I love me some dipping sauce.

Royal Red  Robin Burger ~    Mmm I do luv a burger with an egg.  It just makes it oh so yummy with the creaminess of the yolk.   Shredded lettuce, tomato, cheese and applewood smoked bacon.   This is a good decent size burger that will definitely fill you up.  Burger was cook medium well with some charring around the edges and the buns were nice and soft. Onion Rings ~   So instead of fries I decided on onion rings because I don't have them as often as I like.    These were hot, crispy and the onions were cooked perfectly.  Dunk those suckers in some kyaaaatchup and your good to go!

I love the burgers, fries, mac and cheese, raspberry limeade and the shakes. However, don't get me started on the staff. Service has been nothing but slow, it takes FOREVER to get refills on anything. Sometimes I feel like I am just being plain ignored.  When I've been, I've mentioned the service to at least two different managers but it never seems to make a difference. If there was another Red Robin closer to me, I would probably go there instead.

354,John S.,"Costa Mesa, CA",301,111,31.0,4.0,2012-03-06,"Burgers starting at just $5.99 with BOTTOMLESS FRIES!! Red Robin is great! To start, they have some pretty amazing burgers! One of my favorites is their bbq bacon burger, but they have another one with an egg in it which is growing popularity. Their burgers are big and thick like a good burger should be. They give you all of the vegetables you'd expect lettuce, tomato, pickle, onion, sauce, and choice of cheese and bun. Another great thing about Red Robin is that ANY BURGER CAN BE MADE VEGETARIAN. So if you're like me and a friend that is vegetarian but you have a huge craving for a juicy all-American burger then you can still go to Red Robin and everyone will be happy. In fact, my friends who are vegetarian love their burgers as much as everyone else so far. So it is a crowd pleaser! The burgers also come with bottomless fries so you can eat to your heart's content!  The restaurants are decorated pretty well with different memorabilia and photos/paintings from the last few decades. It's somewhat like a little museum and is actually quite interesting to look around and start conversations about it while you wait for your food. The restaurant also has a full bar. Somehow overall I would say this is a place you could take your family and kids to while keeping a good clean atmosphere that the whole family, group of friends, or just going alone could enjoy. They advertise as ""The Best Burgers in America"" and they do a pretty good job of living up to it or at least coming close.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-santa-ana?start=340,3.56,3.56,3.56,3.44,3.5600000000000005

It's located in a shopping plaza that has Ross, Sports Authority, and TJMaxx. I'd been to this shopping center before but never noticed there was a Red Robin here! It's also near DX Peruvian that I've also been to a couple of times. This is a spacious and clean restaurant. There were about a dozen in our party, and the staff were very helpful in getting our table ready and taking our drink and food orders. I haven't been to a Red Robin in a while.  Previously, I would always get Fish and Chips or Clucks and Fries, but this time I decided to try the Souper Sandwich Combo: a BLTA croissant sandwich (bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, and avocado with chicken) and a cup of French onion soup. I also got a side order of sweet potato fries. The food was so delicious! The sandwich was a good size, cut in two, and tasted fresh and healthy. The soup was so yummy, and so were the fries. Overall, I was very happy with my choice and was glad that I tried something new. I would definitely recommend this Red Robin :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-santa-ana?start=320,3.68,3.68,3.68,3.408,3.6800000000000006
391,Julie S.,"Fountain Valley, CA",0,2,,2.0,2012-04-13,"We've been frequent customers of this restaurant for years, but the last two times we've been here, the service has been terrible.  Both times, our waiter or waitress went on their break during our meal and told us someone else would ""cover"" for them and ""take good care of us"".  They didn't ask if we needed anything before they went on break as they rushed off, but told us someone would check on us shortly.  The persons scheduled to ""cover"" for them took 15 - 20 minutes to check up on us to see if we needed anything which we did.  We wanted refills on our drinks which we didn't get until long after we were finished eating, and I needed something for my meal that finally came after my dinner partner was long finished eating.   On our last visit, a man at a table next to us vented his similar frustrations to the manager and was given a discount on his meal.  I also spoke to the manager about our frustration and he apologized in a very phony manner and was rude about the whole thing saying people needed to take their breaks and he didn't understand why our service was so bad.  I agreed that it didn't make sense, but he did nothing to make up for it.  The waitress who was ""covering"" finally brought our check and ran our Red Robin card which had a $5 discount on it, and she didn't even print the slip that showed our discount.  I had to call the manager over again and ask him to re-run our card telling him I had received an email about the discount coming to us, and he first said I'd need to contact Red Robin directly and after a few minutes of me insisting that my card be re-run, he did so unenthusiastically and we got our $5 off.   Bad management at this restaurant.

I always ask for more because they tend to scrimp. The burger styles offered will make everyone happy. My husband adores the steakhouse burger with a fried egg on top. I'm a fan of the whiskey river, or anything with BBQ sauce really ...  Bonus insider tip: you can swap out any burger patty with a chicken breast or turkey patty instead, not bad if you're calorie counting.

The burger was good, and probably the cheapest burger on the menu. If you go here you are going to pay for a 10 dollar burger. I recommend asking for a basket of fries before getting your burger so while you wait you can munch on fries. Red Robin has it's own seasoning, so you sprinkle that on the fries. It helps if you have a rewards card with them. You get a free burger for every 10 burgers you buy.

We were in a bit of a rush cause we needed to catch a movie at south coast after we ate. We elected to eat in the bar area and we were seated immediately. Since being in a hurry we ordered right away and we received our order in a timely manner.  I ordered a fav of mine (Bruschetta Chicken Sandwich) besides all the delicious burgers options they have. But the reason I love going to RR is the bottomless fries! They are the fat steak type fries with I love! The only thing that kind of irked me was the amount of fries that I got with my sandwich. There was probably like six total. I instantly ordered another refill of fries for the both of us. We get a refill basket and again it was a pretty pathetic portion. I know they are bottomless. But it looked like they were skimping on the amount they used to give out. Shacking my fist at the economy!!!! I'm sure I didn't need as many fries as I would of wanted health wise so I guess they did me a favor.

I ordered the Whiskey River BBQ Chicken Salad, and asked for no chicken, with a side of fries. When I came home and opened it, I was disappointed. They didn't include any BBQ sauce, which is the dressing for this particular salad. Instead they gave me three things of ranch. It doesn't get ranch nor is it necessary for that much. Plus, the side of fries I asked for, there were maybe less then half a box full. That was no where near a full order of fries. AND they were completely unseasoned. That was the only reason I got them! I love the seasoned fries. And if they come that way, then why not ask me if I would like some seasoning on the side? So now I'm left with a naked salad, bland fries, and a ton of ranch.  I've had this salad once before and fell in love. So I was excited for it, and it sucks when you get all the way home and discovered they didn't do their job. And I paid $13 - for one salad and fries. I wont be splurging their again any time soon.

Ok...I guess. I let it go after all it's a business right? We got our drinks both Strawberry Freckled Lemonade. So waited for our dip for about 20 minutes then it arrived with some really greasy chips and lukewarm nacho sauce piled with a dollop of meat and what seemed to be cilantro but we were hungry so we didn't complain. It was about 35 minutes after getting the appetizer that we got our burger (mind you this was on a Monday at 3pm. Idk why the wait was so long there seemed to be maybe 8 more people in the restaurant) When our burgers finally came I was shocked. The basket full of fries were replaced with some idiotic napkin holder. I was pissed if I'm going to pay $1.50 extra you better bring me a basket of those fries. My sister liked her burger and I did too my only complaint about it was that my bunny was really soggy. So I'm pretty sure our order had been siting there for quite a bite of time. I finished my fries in record time (there were maybe four or six fries that were jammed into that napkin holder they use for their fries now) and flagged down our server to bring me another round. I finished my burger and my drink before she came back with my other order of fries. Thankfully it was a large plateful and I was still hungry. My only other complaint was that our server although upbeat and friendly was pretty damn slow. Took forever on our refills and on clearing the empty glasses away. I'm not picky. I know that being a server requires a lot of energy but on a slow day like that it shouldn't have been much trouble to get refills without a seven to twelve minute gap of wait time. Really kills me to write a review about Red Robin like this. I had amazing times six months ago and even years ago as well. They were fast and their meals great didn't matter if this was during their slowest or busiest times.

Food: The food is tasty and reasonably priced. There new smoke pepper burger is delicious. I recommend asking for no salt on the fries, because they tend to over salt them.  Service: Every time that I have come here, the service has been sub par. Most of my complaints seem to boil down to the servers being slow. Whether it's refilling drinks or bringing you a check, everything seems to be an ordeal.  If you have a gift card or if you are coming here for a birthday burger, expect a problem. I honestly, don't think they know how to deal with these forms of payment because myself, friends and family all have had problems when we try to pay with these methods.

I'd actually never been to a Red Robin. Well it was very crowded (are you kidding me?) and we had to wait, for a LONG time, but at least it was overpriced and the food was bad. Really bad. $32 for a meal that in all seriousness would have been better at Wendy's. Wendy's sells the exact same food for half the price and it tastes better. I had a chicken caesar wrap made with an uncooked, cold tortilla, overcooked frozen chicken breast and a tiny bit of lettuce. Really? It was so dry I had to ask for a little salad dressing on the side to even make it edible at all. And my daughter had an undercooked burger that was thin and tasteless. The burger patty looked like the cheap ones from Costco. She asked for avocado on it and they gave her guacamole with so much raw onion in it that it, too, was virtually inedible. Why was that place packed? I really don't get it. Please explain. Oh, yeah, and the manager came and asked, ""Was our food great?"" Uh, no, not really, but since he didn't ask in a way that I could actually answer him, and dashed off quickly, I didn't tell the truth. Please, people, there's Thasos Greek right there, and a good Cuban place and a fish taco place nearby. Support your local independent restaurants and don't patronize this swill.

Our usual RR is the one on Katella, but tonight, this location was closer to us. Yay for us. Starting with the positive: I actually enjoy most of the food at the other location RR, and the selections we sampled at this one generally seemed on par (except for the no-cheese mac n cheese -- bleh). It is clean and the servers are friendly. I really liked my sloppy mess of a Chophouse burger, and even the bun was pretty nice (soft, dense, with just the right hint of toastines on the edges). The outlier in our group who ordered Clucks (chicken tenders) reported satisfaction.  And the rest: Service was inexplicably slow for a non-holiday, Thursday night. The restaurant wasn't busy by any means, but gradually filled up after we had been seated and our orders taken. Then, we got to watch the same later-seated tables served their food about 15 minutes before ours appeared. The Smoke N Pepper burger (13$) was perhaps slightly better than a Carl's Jr. Six dollar burger. Our single salted caramel ""Monster"" shake didn't arrive until after most of our meal was finished, and then only after a succession of inquiries had been made of more than one passing staff. Something had mysteriously transformed all the salted caramel flavoring back to vanilla -- theoretically,  the same rift in the fabric of time and space which delayed our food at the pass, also might have triggered a magnetic field at the bar, which reverse-engineered the caramelian molecules until they had expired. And it was a *midget* monster shake at that, durnit. I'd call it 12 oz of actual shake content, tops.  Of note: when they ask if you want your burgers with ""some pink"" it means medium. We all three burger people ordered ""some pink"" and received patties that were completely browned through. Why did they bother asking in the first place? We ate them anyway because it was getting late and we were getting desperate for food. Also note that while our burgers literally came with containers of steak fries that were bottomless, these were not refilled once. In all, it wasn't a complete failure, but this visit to the Costa Mesa RR location did not make a good enough impression to prompt future visits. The birthday child was sternly warned that when Grandma and Grandpa came from out of town to take us to Birthday Dinner Part 2 on Sunday, he was to choose another restaurant.

Never the less, I ordered my whiskey bbq turkey burger...arrived fairly quickly and very tasty as usual. My issue these days with Red Robin- that although there are bottomless fries,they give you very little. I assume this is a selling tactic to not waste, but they give you about a servings' worth of fries and you almost always ask for more. The bar does leave it less for you to have a more personable dining experience, but its all relative.  I did have the red velvet cake for dessert and it was actually really good. Otherwise, this is not my best Red Robin experience, I think the one at the Spectrum boasts a better experience. The one at Tustin District is second, this one ranks third.

He likes the burgers here so we bring him every time he visits. Even without him, we sometimes come for a casual meal in the bar. The service is consistently slow even if the place is empty. Last year when we brought my dad the service was awful. We were seated without menus, we got our own, the waitress took forever to show up & seemed peeved when she took our drink orders & we indicated we wanted to place our food orders too. Once the food arrived we needed utensils & refills, but she never came back with them. We flagged down another staff member who instead of getting us what we needed offered to find us our server who took more time to bring us what we needed. We also had to wait an extended period of time for our server to appear so we could flag her down to ask for the bill & then waited again for her to take forever to bring it over. This year during my dad's visit we went in with low expectations. Once we were seated and given menus true to form we were completely ignored. After about 10 minutes of no one coming over, I asked the host if we could get a server. Another 10 minutes later the host showed up & asked if he could get us drinks. Let me add that at this point other tables were also totally being ignored. Then, a manager walked by, I hoped he was going to notice what was going on & ask if we needed anything, but he just walked right past us oblivious to our existence. That was the last straw, we decided to leave instead of waste more time waiting around for the server who clearly had zero intentions to show up. As we got up to leave the host showed up with our iced teas. (We had the first table by the host stand) As we were leaving our table and crossing the host stand announcing why we were leaving the manager walked towards us AGAIN completely oblivious to what was happening, in fact he walked out WITH US to the parking lot & jogged over clearly to what was more important than his job.

My brother wanted to get some bottomless fries, server was passing by a young lady. He caught her attention not even bothering to ask if we were doing fine! He ask if we could have a basket of fries and she seriously did not know what we were talking about like seriously? She left to talk to someone and she came back and she was like uhh I don't think your order is ready yet and just said sorry and took off. Then our food came in. For the whole time we ate no one stop by to ask how we were doing. Our server the bartender was instead talking to this guy making him drinks and not pay attention to us at all. My brother was seriously upset the way we were treated. He really wanted to talk to a maneger because this kind of service is just unacceptable but from we saw there was seem to be no manager.

The service was fine and the food was fine but then when we put the coupon on the end of the meal we were told it expired yesterday. I was super bummed.

187,Rod G.,"Costa Mesa, CA",29,52,,3.0,2014-07-12,"I have mixed feelings about Red Robin.   I would give them a 4 for their food which is usually really good. On occasion they have brought out the burgers rare on one half and medium well on the other.  Not sure how they manage that as it is cooked on a conveyor belt. The service that has problems.  Most of the waitresses have been exceptional.  The hostesses are often a problem.  When asked how long the wait is, we are told about 15 minutes.  when it was getting close to 15 minutes, I asked if we were almost up and ws told it would likely be another 20 minutes.  Really?  they've been in business long enough to figure the wait much better than that.  I also handed the girl my ""Reward"" card and asked if I had any rewards available.  She had to go get the manager who came out and explained that it was a reward card not a gift card.  Daaaah.  I know that!  That is why I asked if there were any ""Rewards"" available. I did get two rewards in my email last week.  One for a birthday burger and the other for a free desert.  The problem is that I had one week to use both of them and you can only use one at a time.  the manager said he could do nothing about that.  Guess he isn't aware that a manager always has the ability to use managers discretion.  The dessert would have cost them less than loosing a customer or have an unhappy customer go tell the story on the Internet.

That was ok, we did get seated eventually.  I noticed not only was the table sticky but all the menu pages were as well which grosses me out.  The floor looked like it hadn't been cleaned in days and there was actually a fry on the elevated shelf between the booths, right at eye level.  So I ordered one of my go-to menu items, the souper sandwich combo.  My favorite chicken tortilla soup and a caeser chicken wrap.  Took some time for the food to come.  I have eaten this soup for years and know exactly what it should taste like. This was a cup of dishwater with some vegetables in it, not much chicken, not even the right color or consistency!  I took a couple of bites and could not continue.  My caeser wrap was mostly dry greens, perhaps a tablespoon of chicken in each half.  So very sad.  I have never before left a Red Robin location hungry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-santa-ana?start=300,2.64,3.34,3.34,2.34,3.0600000000000005

160,Paul L.,"Costa Mesa, CA",2,52,62.0,2.0,2014-07-23,"I really used to love Red Robin... I'm talking eating here for lunch, dinner, several times a month. But, alas, that day has come and gone. Ever since the new menu / style revamp their service has more or less declined. Food quality and quantity have taken a dive too. Maybe caught them on a bad day? It took our waitress tonight ten minutes after being seated just to introduce herself and ask us for our drinks... I ordered chili cheese fries and my friend got fish and chips. The fish and chips was really good, a tad pricey at $12.99 though for what you get... The chili cheese fries were pathetic. I guess their ideal chili is one that has no sauce whatsoever and is basically baked on top of the fries. Also, in the menu it says it's served with a side of ranch... We had to ask for the ranch. C'mon Red Robin! Know your menu! Red Robin needs to learn from Farrel's Ice Cream Parlour, chili cheese fries means saucy, piled on, chili and cheese, not baked ground beef and cheese sprinkled with bacon on top of fries.  Thankfully the waitress didn't put up a fight when I asked her to take it off the tab. (We barely ate it)  Knit picking here, but the waitress also never really checked up on us, didn't offer to refill my water till we were basically finished.  Paying our bill took a long time too. Another ten minutes waiting for that. I also asked about their gift card promo that comes with a movie ticket and they said the gift card can't be used till six hours after purchase. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?! Since when does it ever take six hours to load a gift card?!?! Plus the hostess said we could purchase and use it the same night.  Red Robin, either serve your guests 100% or continue being like 90% of Orange County who nickel and dime / tease customers with offers. ""Free stuff! But there's a catch!""  Anyways, there really used to be wonderful waiters and waitresses here, they were all gone tonight sadly. They were awesome, they could take your order without writing anything down. Refilled your drinks without asking and checked on you regularly, but not overly much.  So the fish and chips are really good and that's how our experience went tonight.

Red Robbin is Best known for their burgers. When you walk in the you are greeted by a friendly hostess and they seat you right away. No wait time which is nice. They have a full bar with TV's all over or they have the regular dining area with comfy booths. The decor is unique they have movie poster everywhere. I don't think there are any blank spaces on the walls.  The servers are all very nice and nice looking. They have a pretty big menu with a lot of different types of burgers. I was a little disappointed that they didn't have a monster burger or some outrageous burger challenge. I mean a place best known for burgers should have some gigantic burger. I tried to order the biggest thing i could find on the menu which was the Signature burger called The Colossus for the Hercules Movie. In my opinion this was a pretty sad burger so I added a patty to beef it up so it could live up to its name. The Triple Colossus! When the burger came out i was like dude this is like a regular burger. I seriously could have ate another one. As for the flavors of it nothing special. That's the problem i have with this Burger joint. There's nothing special about them. For that amount of money Id rather eat at Slater 50/50 and be in burger heaven. My Boss said he like his burger but again nothing special. The also ordered endless french fries. They were alright. Overall the food was good but definitely not my first choice when it comes to eating burgers. They need to do something different. Spruce it up!

I haven't been to a Red Robin in a while and was pleasantly surprised when I tried this location for the first time.  I ordered the Keep It Simple burger and was very impressed by both its presentation and its taste.  The fire-grilled patty looked awesome and the presentation was pretty (see picture).  Fire-grilled with a criss-cross pattern burnt on the patty and with pink juices oozing out, this is as good as a burger could look!  One bite and I was in love with it.  Perfectly medium as I ordered, juicy, and flavorful - this was good.  I mean GOOD!  This burger completely changed my impression of Red Robin.  Haven't been to one in a while, but now I may be going there often! The fries were prefect.  Perfectly golden brown and crispy on the outside and slightly starchy inside - YUM!.  And they were fresh from the fryer!  When you pick them up with your fingers, they will slightly burn your fingertips.  If you are not careful, you'll burn your tongue.  This is exactly how French fries are supposed to be served.  And how can you not order another serving of their bottomless fries?  If there's a knockout punch, this is it.  The second serving of fries was as perfect as the first one.  That's consistent execution. Service was good.  Although the hostess was a bit robotic, my server has been really cool and upbeat and exuded enthusiasm in her work.  Service has been prompt and attentive.

I could have got a better burger from wendy's so I was very disappointed.  Im giving this three stars because the wings were good and my server was very good.  I didn't complain inside the restaurant because it was late and they were about to close, plus I don't think I should have to tell a restaurant that specializes in burgers how to make one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-santa-ana?start=240,2.88,3.21,3.21,2.3120000000000003,3.078
140,James L.,"Mission Viejo, CA",2,109,11.0,1.0,2014-11-16,"I've been to many Red Robins, but this must be the WORST RED ROBIN EVER. Context: I used to go to Red Robin all the time, because of great burgers, short wait times, and friendly and thorough service. I never gave less than 20% tip because the experiences were so phenomenal. This location may have turned me off to Red Robin altogether. There was a 20 min wait to get seated even before 6pm, even though there were empty seats. I didn't even know who my server was in the beginning because my server never showed and another server helped him out. My drinks wasn't filled, my burgers showed up before my appetizer (which I cancelled), and for 20 mins I couldn't find my server to get an extra basket full of fries or get the bill. To be fair, the server was nice in the 3 times I saw him anywhere within the vicinity of our table during the an hour and twenty minutes we were at the restaurant. Trying to proxy through another server was also difficult because they either relay back to the original server, or avoid eye contact altogether because they're not serving me (mostly the latter). We also sat in a location where two of the lights above us were broken. So the corner was kind of dark. The seat was also a little dirty. Seems like they didn't take care of their facilities very well either.

And if I'm going somewhere already you'll already know that it's because it's known for being great! But this time I'm actually going to write a good review because the customer service here was excellent! Better than anywhere I've been in awhile. I've been to Red Robin before with my family and the only thing I remembered about the experience was the onion rings tower.  But this time I had a birthday coupon so I thought why not? I went with my boyfriend and it was during the lunch rush so we ended up sitting at the bar. There was one waitress and it was a full house so it took a while before we could order. The waitress was doing an excellent job though. She was engaging and joking with customers. It was admirable the way she was handling the bar area by herself. So we ordered and we were pretty patient even though people who ordered after us were getting their food already. We ended up sitting there for 30 minutes or more but I was having a good time talking to my boyfriend so I didn't mind. (Usually I would be really mad) Also the waitress would come up to us reassuring us about the food and telling us she yelled at the cooks for us so that helped. We ended up getting our food after our waitress let one of the managers or host not sure, that her bar area wasn't getting food on time because of a technical problem with the computers and people were blaming her. And she mentioned us in the conversation. It was funny because we weren't even mad but I appreciated her showing us she genuinely did care. After that we got our food, everyone was really helpful. For example, right after we asked for more fries they would bring it over in under a minute. BRAVO TO YOU RED ROBIN. Our waitress also forgot about the birthday coupon so we asked the host and she also gave us 25% off for the wait and a birthday sundae! Normally restaurants don't give my boyfriend and I customer service this amazing and to think they were all so nice just because we had to wait a little and we weren't even mad about it! There are some reviews on yelp about bad customer service here but I really enjoyed my experience and I hope the rest of the people who come to the restaurant is greeted with the same service.

The strawberry speckled is also a must have for me! They do this cool thing where you get a rewards Card and for every 10th item you get another item free.

She said something that the cooks had a big order before us. 2 other party's sat down after us and received their food and left. I let her know we did not have silverware she said she would get.  Meanwhile I went to the restroom that had the urinals over flowing urine on floor and paper towels all over the floor. Another patron was complaining to me about the restroom mess. I sat down 60 minutes has past and our food arrived. I reminded the server we did not have any silverware! Ashley said she would be right back. The food stayed in front of my wife and granddaughter. 5 minutes went by and I went to get silverware that's when Ashley came by and she said she would get it. The manager I think his name was John came to the table and apologized and offered free desserts. We declined but said to him we appreciate him coming over and offering.

I ordered items to pick up and when I arrived the manager - Aiden - was completely rude and pawned me off to a newbie who told me that one of the items I ordered was no longer on the menu. Rather than let me know at the time I placed the order that they no longer offered this, he waited to tell me when I showed up. Well, after I explained that they did in fact have a similar salad they went off to prepare it while the rest of my food sat there getting cold. In the meantime I asked the manager how they could take my order and not let me know on the phone it wasn't offered? He looked at me and walked away from me without an answer and managed to completely avoid eye contact the whole time I waited (at least 20 minutes). Then when I get home with the food the fries were cold. There were maybe 12 fries in the order...and the chicken was rubbery. I threw most of it away.

I have no idea why, must have been the wide variety on the menu and the reasonable prices.  Now in my adult life I find myself going, not every week but every once in awhile. They have good fries and when I have a chicken finger craving it's my number one thought.  The food is decent and the service is awful, which is something I have known since I was young and remind myself of each time I choose to go to this restaurant. I typically don't complain but after this experience I feel as though I should share.  I am recently gluten and dairy free so I asked for their special menu, I learned they had online. The host didn't know what I was talking about but said that he would find out for me, which I appreciated. We were sat at the table and the waiter came over. After ordering drinks we asked for my menu and he came back showing me how to order. I was excited to learn that the selection wasn't too limited. We ordered an appetizer and got our drinks. We sat for about an hour before hearing anything about our food which was finally delivered shortly past the hour after we ordered it. I was immediately disappointed to see that I had been given a burger instead of the chicken sandwich that I had ordered. I sent it back and he said it would be fixed. My brother also ordered a kids macaroni and cheese, with extra macaroni and cheese oppose to a side which is something we had ordered for him many times and it hadn't been an issue. The waiter didn't tell us they couldn't do it until they brought his food, so we also had to ask for another order of it. I waited for my chicken sandwich and they brought it to me, this time with red onions opposed to the grilled ones I asked for, I didn't say anything though because I didn't want to wait for it. After all finishing our food we were still waiting for the other kids macaroni and cheese.  Overall we had terrible service, as we didn't get our drinks refilled and our waiter seemed unsympathetic to the fact that two out of four orders were wrong (one of them wrong twice). The food was mediocre as my brothers first order of macaroni and cheese was burnt.  Probably done going back to Red Robin.

It took about 10-15 minutes for a waited to even come to our table to take our drink order, which by that time we already knew what entrees we wanted. Our server, Matthew, came over finally and apologized for the wait time after we asked if it was really busy. He put our order in right away and close to used to check in with us the rest of the night - he brought our food out later and we could tell it was brought as soon as it was done because it was still really hot. I think the manager might have stopped by our table - but it was really just a lady came by and said ""how are you guys doing. Good? Good."" And then left. That was weird. But I really appreciate the attention that Matthew paid to our table after seeing our dissatisfaction, rather than shoving free stuff in our face to try and make up.

My kids really believe that there is one in every city that we go to, whether it's in the Bay Area or in Southern California. Our last family trip to Disneyland was no different. We're staying in a Doubletree Hotel (where my brother works at back here at home), there must be a Red Robin around too. I'm not sure if that's their full thought process on RR's, but I would bet money on my theory.  Anyways, we sought out a RR about two miles away from our hotel. It was January 1st about 3:00PM when we arrived. We had lasted in Disneyland until 2AM the night before, so we were lagging, tired and ready for some food. We were seated right away, as there weren't many people in there at the time. There were a few other tables that had customers at them. I believe there was only one waiter at the time. He came over within a few minutes of us being seated and took our drink order.  I tried handing him my rewards card, as most of the RR's ask for it right away. He said that he would take it when the check comes. We pretty much order the same thing when we come every time. Double order of cheese sticks for appetizers, two clucks and fries, kids mac and cheese with mandarin oranges, teriyaki chicken burger, no lettuce and five alarm burger with no tomatoes. He came back with our drinks, helped the other table with something they needed and then took our order. He ordered the appetizers on the kiosk screen at our table when we told him we wanted them. I'm not sure if the order gets in that much faster, but that was the first time that I've ever had a waiter put the appetizer order in at the screen instead of just placing it himself. I could understand if it was super busy and the order would get in faster, but there really was not a lot of people. Anyways, I'm assuming a manager, brought out the cheese sticks. But there wasn't any ranch with it, just marinara. My kids noticed right away that the ranch was missing and we asked for some. A weird thing to have missing, especially when a higher up is delivering them to a table. We received our food within a timely manner and everything tasted good and was correct. There's just some things that I notice or expect, I suppose when dining at a Red Robin. Drinks were not refilled without being empty and asked multiple times. We showed a coupon we had for a birthday burger. There was no singing for my twins...luckily they didn't care that there was no singing or birthday sundae. Just some things that I noticed about this visit that were overlooked or odd that it didn't happen. But it's nothing traumatic or to make me upset, just observations. I know that we'll be back at Red Robin again soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-santa-ana?start=40,2.64,2.76,3.168,2.54,2.712

It started out like any ordinary evening with the waitress being alittle busy but being attentive and bringing exactly what we ordered. The root beer floats were amazing as always and the burgers were just phenomenal this evening. We finished our meals, paid and got ready to say goodbye to our friend when my daughter asked for a balloon and unfortunately they didn't have blown up so the host, James, told us to hang out and he would go grab some and it would take just a moment. So my wife asked me if I could go grab the car and pull it up, (kinda a cool night) so of course I oblige and walk out the door on a direct path for the car but was greeted very kindly by an older homeless gentleman asking for a dollar or two so he could get something hot to eat. Unfortunately I don't carry cash but I did happen to have some dollars in the car and told him I would see what I had and I'd be right back. As I was walking to the car something struck me (I am a very observative person) although he didn't gloat it or even mention it trying to get money, I noticed he was a USMC veteran by a ring and his tattoo on his forearm. So as I drove back up I found a $20 bill. With my wife and daughter waiting for me I parked and told them to wait in the car until I got back. I walked up to the gentleman and asked him if he had served and what branch, he introduced himself as Tedd and confirmed he was a disabled USMC veteran that had served our country in Vietnam. He had fallen on hard times and with no family around he was forced into homelessness and is working on finding work so he can hopefully get a place soon. So I ask him if instead of giving him a couple of dollars if I could buy him a hot meal. He lit up like a kid on Christmas morning and excitedly thanked me at least 4 times. I asked him if he would like to come in and order and he said he felt uncomfortable since he hadn't had a shower in days so I took his order and went in. The same host asked me if everything was okay (probably since I was just there and then came back in) and if there was anything I needed. I told him I would like to get the homeless veteran a meal and gave him the order. He said he would be right back with the ticket and he would make sure the gentleman got his meal and drink. So as I was waiting the manager, Tai, walks up and asks me if I had any questions or needed anything. I said ""as a matter of fact I do have a question, there is an older homeless veteran outside and I am going to buy him a hot meal. Is there a way that he can enjoy his meal inside at a table? Ill pay the tip in advance."" He said with a shocked look ""Absolutely, I had no idea anyone was out there!"" After a few more words with Tai, James came back up with a bill and so I handed him the $20 and as he turns to go get my change, the manager stops him and says ""here let me take care of this"" at this point I'm thinking, okay cool he is gonna discount it for me but instead he hands me back my $20 and says ""this ones on us"" shocked I said "" its okay I am happy to pay for it"" and he argues saying ""no really we want to, please go ask him to come in and we will get a table ready."" I walked outside handed the guy the money that the manager told me to keep and told him the meal was paid for and to just keep his focus and he will be back on the right path soon. He thanked me with many thanks and tears in his eyes and with that I told him to enjoy his meal and sorry i had to run but if I see him again we will sit down for a meal together. He thanked me again, shook my hand and off I went.  I was truly overwhelmed with happiness with this managers gesture! If you are in the area of this Red Robin stop in and say hi to James (host) and Tai (the manager) and show them gratitude for the great people that they are! Thank you Tai and James for everything you did last night for me and Tedd, and keep up the EXCELLENT service!

Our booth had dirt, as in mud, on the seats. They said they were going to bring someone to clean it with a towel but that never happened. I had to use a lot of napkins to clean it off. We asked for a booster seat and it was super sticky and just smelled bad. At least wipe it down once in a while guys!  Our waitress was sort of nice but she made a lot of mistakes and misses. In our section, which is her section, there was only two other tables besides us. We ordered our food. I ordered a salad (Southwest sombrero) which I've never tried previously. Didn't want to get a burger because I'm over their burgers from the last time.  While waiting for our food, I noticed a foul odor that reminded me of a dirty toilet. It's not a smell you want while you eat. They started making coffee which masked most of the smell. Thank goodness! Lol. Our server was slow and kept forgetting to bring us things we asked for or things that come standard with the stuff we ordered. At the end, we noticed she had forgotten 5 things that night. Sides were missing, wrong sides were brought... Milkshakes were the wrong size and they had to make new ones because she had forgotten to bring us our shakes so it was just sitting on the counter and they threw it away not knowing which table it was. What a waste. The banana milkshake which used to be good here, now tastes like banana flavored powder instead of real bananas.  My salad was so bland in flavor but just tasted like salt, and the chicken tasted burnt. The 'sombrero' which was a tostada with cheese on it was stale, greasy, and the cheese looked like it had been microwaved on a couple times (you know what I'm talking about?) Everyone said their burger was meh. We did like the fried pickles though, so 1 star for that.  The steak fries weren't as good tonight too, which is sad because they were the only things I liked about RR with the ranch and honey mustard poppyseed sauce.

He mentioned this twice to the waitress, she said ""What would you like me to do, reheat it?"" He said no, could you bring me out some hot ones. She brought him 1 piece of chicken on a plate, sat it down on the table and walked away. He also asked for fries since those were cold also. She brought it 5 fries. My veggie burger had seen better days also. It looked like someone smashed it, their was hardly any toppings on it, the bun was smooched and I also only got 5 fries, Thank God for bottomless fries! But the bottom line is, if I am paying almost $30 for a meal/dinner. I want it hot, fresh and a good amount on my plate! Having to ask over and over for more fries since all she brought out was 5 at a time was ridiculous, She also took my ice tea to refill it and didn't bring it back for 15 minutes.

My training there made me a fabulous bartender and cocktail server that supported me for many years in school. And I owed it to the care, training, skills, courtesy and expectations I learned from Red Robin.  But this locations exhibits none of the values I learned or I received that allowed me to be proud of my serving and interpersonal skills and where I got them.  Every time I come to this location I am completely ashamed of the level of lack of care complacency and ignorance we encounter. Our servers don't know what is on burgers (say they sneak out of burger tests easily), always forget the modifications we ask for (and we have to wait while their food runners fix it while our food gets cold), don't clear piled up items of tables (say their manager is really mellow and doesn't really care if they are on top of things), never bring fry refills (always too busy with their four table section to remember) and take eons to get a drink order in or a bill (they aren't up on service times as it's pretty mellow there we are told). It's a perfect example of doing the bare and frustrating minium and offering zero apologies when it affects the guests time, food, experience and comfort.I could go on but I think you get th gist.  This is a perfect location and know it's the only reason people come back...as it cannot be the servers.

They used to do 3-6PM is happy hour, and 8PM to closing, but now it's only the 3-6PM!!!  We got there Wednesday night a little after 8PM, and the waitress sat us down. When she took our order, we asked if there was a happy hour, and she said yes that should be starting. So it was $1 off adult beverages and 1/2 off a couple of appetizers like wings and nachos which are normally $9. We each got a drink and wings to share. The drinks are good (honestly they are pretty cheap. $5.50 for a house margarita?!) and the food is fine. No complaints about that.  Then when the bill came out, we noticed that the happy hour was not included. So we asked the waitress, and she said she would go fix that for us. Then the manager came back and actually said they no longer do the happy hour, but for us, he ended up comp'ing the nachos we got, so we still got a similar discount than if we got it from the happy hour. The waitress came and apologized to us too, saying she didn't know they don't do late night happy hour anymore. She said it was her first day back from a break, and didn't know until now either.

I found the food to be a bit boring, and it was just an uncomfortable experience.  When it came time to pay the bill, he had the wrong charges, finally fixed it and then handed us the tablet type machine to pay with, wait, wait, come back, we are paying cash.  We finally had to snag another wait staff person to get our waiter so we could give him the cash and he seemed annoyed. There are so many great restaurants and burger joints around, I won't bother with Red Robin again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-santa-ana?start=40,2.84,2.86,3.072,3.24,2.852

I am always greeted by the brightest of smiles and the friendliest hellos. The staff at Red Robin is incredible and provides the most excellent customer service, comparable to that of a gourmet restaurant. The cuisine at Red Robin is unmatched by any restaurant. I have a very refined pallet and find that the food at Red Robin satisfies all six of my senses. If you are looking to impress a date, I would suggest bringing them here. The classic American and red ambiance suggests a comfortable and high class vibe that's exudes sexiness. The onion rings are the perfect starter and really set the tone for your evening. Crisped to perfection, the onion rings are amazing wether you are sitting in this fine establishment or at home in bed with your dogs. I actually credit the onion rings to curing my herpes. There truly is a spiritual aspect to this restaurant. I have never felt so close to God than I have in here. If you're looking for a fine dining experience that allows you to abandon your worries at the door, Red Robin is the establishment for you. God bless you Red Robin.

Another reason I love coming here is for their unlimited fries and their speckled lemonade. If you like honey mustard, this place has some of the best honey mustard I have ever had.

When my meal came out, the fries were hot and fresh and the burger was great.  Cooked to my liking and the bacon added gave it that extra crunch that I really enjoyed.  I appreciated Jess's suggestion.   I was checked on throughout the meal ensuring I had everything I needed and was thoroughly taken care of.  My experiences at this particular location are always great, but this time was above average.    Jessica is a very attentive and professional server and she has continued the chain of great experiences at this location to ensure that I go back whenever I want a great meal.    Well done!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-santa-ana?start=60,3.64,2.96,3.084,3.3160000000000003,3.232

You'll definitely be asking for at least another round or two of that. The speckled lemonade is fabulous! It is sweet and has lots of sliced strawberries floating at the bottom of the drink. It also comes in a cool cup that makes it look way fancier than it really is.     Before receiving my entree - the Guacamole bacon cheeseburger - we got boneless wings for an appetizer. The ""wings"" more resembled chicken tenders since they were made up of chicken breast and were super crunchy. We dipped the celery and the wings in the various sauces - bbq, ranch, buffalo - that came with it and they were al pretty good. It was a typical appetizer.  Afterward came the Guac bacon burger. Instead of regular onions, I requested for grilled and they did that without any problem. The burger was stuffed to the max and had a good amount of bacon and avocado to give the cheeseburger a little extra creaminess and crunch. A side of fries also accompanied the dish which was much appreciated.  Since I went here for a group event with 40+ ppl sitting together, I could understand why their service was a little rushed and not as attentive. They were real busy. At this location, there is plenty of parking and plenty of the room in the restaurant for big parties.

I had the Billion Dollar Baby burger and my husband had the Burnin' Love burger.   The Billion burger was very yummy, the crispy potato cake and the hint of truffle really paired well with the saltiness of the bacon and cheese. Good overall balance of flavors but the burger itself was so big, my husband ended up having to help me finish it. The Burnin' burger could have been spicier, it's good but a bit boring. He had the side of broccoli and I had the garlic herb fries which were tasty! ! Very garlicky but it's been cooked with a little soy sauce giving it an Asian twist. I had the freckled lemonade which was a touch too sweet, I would have liked a more pronounced lemon flavor - it was so faint if you told me there was no lemon in it, I'd have believed you.

When I was younger and into burgers I was okay visiting this restaurant but now I rarely visit big chains like this. However, my visit here was not so bad after all.  The food was pretty good but the service was awful, that's the only reason why I docked a star. My friend who is a vegetarian loves this place because they will switch any of their burgers to a veggie patty, which is a very nice touch. I'm not vegetarian but I do try to eat on the healthier side so I was happy to see the last page of the menu had tips to a healthier meal. For example, the menu suggested substituting the fries for a side of veggies and ordering their smaller burgers. I ended up ordering the smaller burger originally 6.99 (not bad!) and substituted the burger for a slightly larger size (8.99) just so I could have it with a chicken breast instead of red meat. The burger bun was toasted to perfection. It was definitely smaller then their other burgers. It was similar to the size of a fast-food burger only the meat was much higher quality. The waitress must have been having a bad day because we were practically the only people in the restaurant (5 o' clock on a weekday) so it's not like she was being overworked at the moment and we weren't rude or problematic at all. After the food came she never checked up on us and we had to use the little call button to get her attention so we could have a refill on our endless fries. Seems much better than it is if you eat regular portions. First they give you a tiny bit to start and then if you have to wait for the waiter to bring a few more by the time you are done with your meal you don't need any more fries. The fries are nothing special. Nothing addicting like at other restaurant chains. To summarize, lower your expectations and you will be satisfied. I may be back, it definitely replaced our rare visits to other major restaurant chains.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-santa-ana,3.36,3.12,3.044,2.7359999999999998,3.2160000000000006

We felt like we needed to say things quickly before she walked away otherwise she wouldn't take our order or our request in time. It's unfortunate because she could have easily taken a few extra seconds & we would have had a much different experience.  Manager:  the manager ended up getting involved because of how bad our Service was. But it was actually other waitress who notice our frustration, she was super kind, really nice, and apologized even tho it wasn't her fault. Once the manager got involved, he apologized, discounted our receipts but at that point the bad impression was done.  Overall experience:  when we walked it, it took about 5-10 mins for anyone to acknowledge us, then it took another 5-10 mins for us to be seated on what it looked like ""not a busy night"". Our service didn't come to our table until about another 10mins & the bad experience just escalated from there.  From being short and not listening clearly to our orders, to feeling like we needed to rush to get a word In, it was just over all. I hope she can get some training on how to be in the hospitality business because it's all about the customer and not about how you feel. I understand people go through something's but you gotta leave that outside and set into your work place with a positive winning attitude.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-santa-ana,2.88,3.17,3.0,,3.054

A nice dinner out sounded great, every time I have come fries would be offered for an appetizer, we did not get offered and didn't bring any. The waitress wasn't the brightest and we asked for our check to be spit between the two groups and it came back on the same receipt and very frustrating for us. Lastly we played trivia on the device and didn't even know it would charge us. I enjoyed the food but the waitress was very frustrating and the experience was a strange one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-santa-ana,2.84,3.16,2.992,,3.0320000000000005
0,Miguel L.,"San Jose, CA",26,204,552.0,4.0,2018-01-09,Well maintained draft beer lines and system equals  consistently good quality tasting pours. Lots of bars get this wrong so often. RR doesn't. And this is across all restaurants I've visited.  Consistency goes a long way. Also this particular branch has superb service at the bar area. I always get quick and very friendly service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-santa-ana,2.84,3.17,2.996,,3.038

We had Jesse as our waitress, and she's super funny and a great server.  Nice job Jesse!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-santa-ana,3.0,3.2,3.004,,3.1200000000000006
