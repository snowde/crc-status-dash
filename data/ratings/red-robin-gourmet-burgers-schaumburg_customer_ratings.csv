104,Mary P.,"Chicago, IL",13,34,,2.0,2012-01-30,Redddd Robin! Grubbbbb! I dunno about this place! The burger and fries meal I ordered tasted mediocre. I wouldn't go here if you want to impress someone! It's more of a lower-middle class family restaurant. Our server was nice!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schaumburg?start=100,3.56,3.56,3.56,3.1760000000000006,3.5600000000000005
74,Matt M.,"Forest Park, IL",1164,1163,27.0,2.0,2012-02-25,"I'm baffled by the good reviews. This place is mediocre on its best day. The food is subpar and reeks of defrosted flavoring. It exactly the type of restaurant you expect the movie ""Waiting"" to be based off of...  The burgers here are a 3.5/10.  The fries are a 2.25/10.  The services isnt horrible, but that doesnt make up for not-any-good food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schaumburg?start=60,3.52,3.52,3.52,3.2720000000000002,3.5200000000000005
96,Elizabeth W.,"Des Plaines, IL",276,332,179.0,3.0,2012-04-09,"Red Robin is a great place to take kids. Every time we come here, there are happy parents and their happy offspring putting away mouthfuls of food. Unlike some other Red Robin locations, though, the staff here seems to know how to organize high chairs and such to prevent a huge clog in the aisles. They even have birthday parties with balloons and other swag. I predict a lot of visits to this place in my future once my little one is big enough for a high chair herself. The staff here will not give you the stink eye because your kid drops a piece of food--they expect that and understand that your child might also leave little ketchup fingerprints on the table. It's clearly so popular with families for a reason. The food isn't bad, either. For a burgers and fries kind of place, they have pretty good selection and a fair number of healthier offerings. I love that I can opt to ""build a burger"" and get a boca vegan patty or gardenburger vegetarian patty and my choice of toppings and bun. Or, diners can opt to omit the bun and enjoy their burger ""protein style,"" wrapped in lettuce. For a small price increase, you can also get sweet potato fries here instead of regular french fries. I am always surprised by how good the sweet potato fries are here since so many places seem to screw them up somehow, usually either by not salting them at all or drowning them in brown sugar. They also offer more beer, shakes, and other beverages than you'd expect. One down side is that the service is pretty hit or miss. On some visits, I leave totally satisfied with the job our server did. Other times, we aren't offered a refill or more ""bottomless"" fries until we've finished eating and have been sitting there for a while--in other words, until it's too late. Sometimes things run smoothly, and we're in an out pretty fast, while other times we sit and wait for the check so long that we end up running late. Usually the servers are at least friendly and nice, but recently we had one who noticed my Cubs shirt and decided to rant at me about how much better the White Sox are while he had me captive. In addition to being rude and inappropriate, I was pregnant at the time and VERY HUNGRY. This guy was playing with fire--getting between a pregnant lady and her food is a dangerous game. He's lucky he didn't lose a hand. My husband was really annoyed that we had to wait for this guy to close his cakehole and give us our food, so he spoke with a manager about it, though we never heard back from the manager about whether he told the server to chill the hell out with that stuff. (Note to the server in question if you happen to read this--you might want to check out this video: And for the record, Zambrano had a no-hitter two seasons ago.) In short, sometimes we have a four or even five star experience here, but other times, Red Robin falls far short. This is a great place to go if you are looking for a burger joint that can feed a carnivore, a vegetarian, and a vegan or a group of children of various ages. For date night, go elsewhere, unless you think having to tell off a server is romantic.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schaumburg?start=80,3.6,3.6,3.6,3.468,3.6000000000000005
49,Pari P.,"Schaumburg, IL",39,400,1282.0,5.0,2012-05-01,"Red Robin, yum. It's the family friendly place where you can get an all-american burger and endless fries.  Yes, there are certainly other burger champions in Chicago but the great thing that I love about Red Robin is that there are no rules or stipulations. It's simply quality food with great service. You also won't find any French cheeses with odd pronunciations here. The burgers here have the right bun to meat ratio unlike other places where the burger comes out like the shape of the roman numeral one. For me, the Blue Ribbon Burger continues to be my favorite - blue cheese, steak sauce, and fried onion straws. It's the perfect combination of strong flavors and textures.  For this non-hipster and fellow suburbian, Red Robin is my place for burgers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schaumburg?start=40,3.68,3.68,3.68,3.7,3.6800000000000006

92,Ethan C.,"Oak Park, IL",30,14,,4.0,2012-09-05,"Red Robin's menu is basically an above average selection of burgers, sandwiches and wraps. As far as chain restaurants go, I would put it at the higher end in terms of quality. But the main reason I'm reviewing this location in Woodfield is to talk about how good the customer service is, along with the kid's meals. We've all heard that the teens and twentysomethings of today's generation are supposed to be pre-occupied with texting their friends on the Twitter and all that, but every single time I've taken my family to this location, no matter how busy and hectic this place is (and during the holiday's it's a madhouse) the hosts and servers at this location are always attentive, courteous and fast.  Also, if you have to take your kid to a chain restaurant, especially in a place like Woodfield, you really can't find a better selection of kid's meals. There's lots of healthy options for little ones, and they are tasty enough that your kid will actually want to eat them. And you might actually want to finish what they don't. I mean, I don't vulture on my kids food at all, but you might want to. Really good customer service, the best kids meals around, and they have Coke Zero in the fountain, which always gets extra credit from me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schaumburg?start=80,3.72,3.72,3.72,3.536,3.7200000000000006

72,Tortuga M.,"Las Vegas, NV",8,45,158.0,5.0,2012-10-05,"We went to RR to get a quick bite to eat.  The hosts greeted us with a smile and quickly seated us at a nice table in the middle of the restaurant.  It wasn't too busy and to me, it seemed as if she really understood that this table was exactly where she should place a small family (3 adults + a 12 yr old).  The hosted told us the waitress would be right there and within a few minutes, Ashley came and introduced herself.  She had a smile on her face and was friendly welcoming.  She asked if we had been to a RR before and for those of us who hadn't she made sure to sound especially gracious and welcoming.   We ordered the onion rings as an appetizer and they were amazing.  They were not greasy and the batter was flavored just right.  I personally didn't use the ranch dressing or the bbq-mayo dipping sauces but the rest of my family loved them.  Ashley was attentive and brought our drinks in a timely manner.  She was even nice enough to deal with my sister-in-law who is picky about her choices.  She had Ashley switch her drink from flavored tea to regular tea to sprite and Ashley never made a face or complained.  Instead she was very accommodating and insisted that it was ""no problem"".   I had the Tavern burger ""cry baby"" style.  I too am picky about what I eat so I asked Ashley to have them make mine with just lettuce, onions and the pepper ketchup.  My sister-in-law got a chicken salad and my brother got a chicken wrap.  My nephew also ate a chicken burger.  Everyone loved their meal, but I was absolutely blown away at how the burger was made exactly to my request.  From the first bite, I knew we had made a great decision.  The crunchy onions, sauteed onions and the pepper ketchup combined well to give it just the right amount of crunch and kick to the burger.  I couldn't wait to get my second bite of the burger and when I did, it was like heaven.   My family who had eaten at a RR before thought I was joking when I kept telling them how much I was enjoying the burger.  I couldn't even talk sometimes as I kept eating and eating bite after bite.  I just wanted to savor the flavors again and again.  The endless steak fries were good but they could be a little less seasoned.   The service at this RR was so great, I made it a point to talk to the manager (forgot his name, sorry) to let him know how impressed I was with the service and the quality of food.  I didn't tell him that I noticed he held a meeting with his staff, but now that I think about it; that is probably why they have great service.   Kudos to this RR and to the leadership team and staff.  I would highly recommend this Red Robin and I would definitely come back again and again.  Now, I can't wait to try the RR near my home in California.  I hope they impress me too!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schaumburg?start=60,3.76,3.76,3.76,3.668,3.76
105,Irene Z.,"Elk Grove Village, IL",71,240,2.0,4.0,2012-11-05,"My kids always love it here and it's one of their first choices for restaurants, particularly the Schaumburg Woodfield location. Great value on the kids meals, entree, side and drink and a good variety in menu choices. I like the healthy options for the sides.  My kids love veggies so the carrots (choice of raw or steamed) and the broccoli are a hit with them. For the adults - the variety in the burgers is fantastic.  Our faves are the Royal Red Robin (egg on a burger is ingenious!), Mushroom, and Banzai Burger.  Never had a burger that wasn't cooked perfectly.  I get mine medium and it always has the perfect amount of pink.  The onion rings are awesome it's a regular appetizer for us. And who doesn't love endless steak fries?  We usually put a generous helping of the Red Robin seasoning on them, but they're good plain as well.  We've  been here often enough that I tell myself I have to try the other things on the menu (fish and chips, pastas, salads), but the burgers are so good that I have to stick with them...but one of these days I'll be able to write an update review on their other entrees! Definitely have to agree with the rave reviews on customer service at the Woodfield location.  Each and every time we've been here, the service has been outstanding no matter what time it is, busy or not.  Quick, friendly, and efficient service.  The manager also almost always does rounds at each table to ensure that things are running smoothly.  Food is served quickly and they really move tables without making you feel rushed.  About half the time we've been here, there's been a line (crowds being in Woodfield), but they always give you an accurate sense of wait time...and get you in when they say they will. Easy to see why it's one of our favorite places.   Red Robin...Yummmm : )",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schaumburg?start=100,3.76,3.76,3.76,3.504,3.76

My mom and I went to Red Robin last week after spending too much time at the mall where she got to buy a lot of cute things and I was broke-as-a-joke and couldn't buy anything.   Anyway, after her spree we were both pretty hungry and didn't want to risk waiting for a table at Cheesecake Factory. I hadn't been to a Red Robin in years.  The burger section of the menu was significantly smaller than I remember, but the other items (fish & chicken sandwiches, entrees) seemed to have grown. The burger was as I remembered it (I had the one with bleu cheese, chipotle bbq, and onion strings) and my mom tasted a new menu item, the cajun salmon sandwich. Overall, everything was good.  We had to wait for refills, ketchup, and extra sauces a bit longer than I would have liked, but not a bad experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schaumburg?start=80,3.84,3.84,3.84,3.436,3.84

I'm not a fan of the ""endless fries"" here. You get a very small portion at first, and unless you really TRY to inhale the fries first, you probably won't get or need a second portion before you're finished or need a box for your burger. Of course this was me, and I felt like I did not get my money's worth. The fries are also a little too fat and mashy (?) in the middle for my tastes.  I like thinner fries that aren't as soft.

My patty was really disappointing since it was undercooked - it was very pale and mushy when it should have a good crispiness or sear on it. Next time I'll try the cod. I wish they offered non-fried fish options! You can't get your bottomless fries BEFORE your burger comes out, but they oblige afterwards. There's a $1.50 upcharge for sweet potato fries, but they're yummy! Our speedy server got us hot fry refills very quickly - both kinds, thankyouverymuch.

No sign what so whoever that says line up to the left to get sitted and line up to the right to be sitted. No structure what so ever. So we waited about 30mins just to get at the door.

So, after another 15mins of waiting. We finally got a text. Saying our table is ready. When we got the door to finally get sitted. The same exact person that took down my phone number. Told me I can't take my stroller inside. This idiot couldve just told me that when I was waiting in line for 45 mins. And cudve went some where else. I ask politely if I could talk to the manager. Manager comes out all flustered. So, after telling the manager my whole dilemma. This freaking idiot tells me   ""you, do know this is our busiest time of the year "" .

The only time he was attentive was when he was giving us the check & picking it up.... We didn't even have to ask for that. If you're gonna have bottomless items on the menu, it shouldn't take half an hour to get a new one.  My cousin got the broccoli & the first time it was steamed nicely. The second time, not so much. The server said they boil it really quick, but they were dry and raw. They seemed to have been microwaved for a few seconds. Yet, they took forever to come out. I don't understand. Also, I wanted garlic parmesan fries, thinking they'd be fresh crushed garlic & parmesan tossed with the fries... but nope, they use garlic powder! What a disappointment!  Do not order this, ever!  Other than that, the appetizers and burgers were good. We got the cheese sticks, tower of onion rings, and fried zucchini. Burgers we got were sautéed shroom and the big pig out.

I'm glad the manager eventually tried to make it up to us and made it seem like our business mattered unlike the other employee who just rolled her eyes at us.

We were given forks with lettuce stuck to them which could be easily forgiven if everything just went smoothly from there, but unfortunately they didn't. Our server forgot my water and never got my wedge of lemon which I didn't even bother asking for. We were given the wrong shake and had to flag someone else to correct it, which was fine since they corrected it after some discussion. They forgot straw so we ask. They forgot my sauce for my bottomless fries, so had to give another reminder there.  Along that note, I had asked for bottomless fries and literally was given a scant amount with my burger. So of course I had to ask for more. Our server passed over us several times without asking if we were okay. It seemed she went to everyone else's table to check on them, but ours which seemed kind of weird to us since we really weren't giving anyone issues despite what was happening. Had to get her attention and she said she'd give me refills for my water and fries . . . let's say it was a while till we got them and my friend said when she looked our way she kind of had that ""o yea. .

Also, they hadn't explained the kiosk properly to us as I hadn't ever used one before and didn't seem too keen to stick around long enough to see if we needed help with it.

The Woodfield location is a completely different story. Where should I begin? The place is filthy, possible health code violations. There was food all over the floor/seats. The bathroom was very dirty as well. There were 3 of us at the table and they brought 2 forks, 2 knives and 2 napkins. We started off by ordering 3 waters with lemon and a freckled lemonade. He brings the water with no lemon. Then it took about 15 minutes to get him to come back and ask if we were ready to order. We again asked for lemons for our water. We had also asked for another set of silverware and more napkins. He never brought them so we walked over to the bar and asked the bar tender who was able to get them to us immediately. Finally, our waiter came back with the lemon slices and we put in our orders.  When our orders arrived mine and my mom's orders were wrong. They sent them back and brought them back a second time. My order had been corrected but they still brought out the incorrect order for my mom. She had ordered broccoli as her side instead of fries. All three times they brought her order they brought fries. We finally flagged down a manager since our waiter was nowhere to be found. He said it would be right out. It took about 10 minutes and they brought it to her. Once we started eating our waiter who had been MIA for a while came and asked how things were. My boyfriend's response was ""eh, it's alright.."" so that our waiter would know we have not been too happy with the service so far. Our waiter laughed and said ""okay"" and walked away. We were all shocked that he didn't even ask what was wrong or what could be done to make the experience better.  As everyone knows RR is known for their unlimited side dishes. We had ordered fries and broccoli. Our waiter never came back to ask if we would like more. He came over to ask if we needed dessert or anything else. We put in multiple orders of our sides at that time since we knew he probably wouldn't come back to check on us for another 20 minutes if not longer. If you're going to have bottomless items on the menu, it shouldn't take half an hour to get a new one. Also, it took forever just to get a refill on our waters. We shouldn't have to flag you down or ask multiple times for more water. If you aren't going to be attentive leave a pitcher of water at our table.

I had to ask to get a refill on my fries and we were only given one refill on the fries when we asked for 3 as there was three in our party. Anytime she came to the table she would say ""everything ok?"" Rather than ""can I get you anything"" which is how a server is supposed to phrase it! Her asking if everything was ok seemed to me like her way of getting out of getting us anything.  We went for their Veterans Day special because my boyfriend is a veteran. Their new system with paying with the kiosks is annoying and hard to figure out when you have multiple people paying and you have to put in your rewards card and redeem a reward.  When we asked for the manager they came quickly which was nice however it took 3 tries for them to fix the bill which the server never fixed in the first place so we could all pay separately.

I've been here a couple times now and I'd come back. I most recently came for my husband's b-day and I tried setting up a reservation, but they don't take them. Still, when I called on a Monday to book for that Tuesday, they said they could set aside space for 15 of us. However, when we showed up, they had no record of the conversation taking place, though I am sure that I called this location and I spoke with someone who kept putting me on hold and seemed to be checking with another employee about the request. They had a suspicion that another employee who wasn't there spoke with a manager who wasn't scheduled either and they failed to notify the next day's crew. Nonetheless, the place was practically empty, they apologized profusely, and they seated us in no time. Our server Alejandro was on top of everything. He kept coming by to check on us and make sure people had what they asked for or we got to place extra orders as needed. They let us take our time and we were able to split up the bill easily with their table kiosks. With 15 people, that was greatly needed and appreciated. It really took the guess work out of separating who had what so people could pay quickly when they were ready to leave at various points throughout the evening. This isn't my favorite place for burgers and fries, but it is a top contender for large events such as this. Aside from the scheduling mix-up, which is understandable since they don't even take reservations to begin with, they've been reliable when we've come and they are affordable. I would highly recommend them for a casual party or family outing because the menu had a little something for everyone who had preferences or dietary restrictions among our friends - kids to adults, meat lovers to vegetarians or chicken-centric, and then some! I normally would get a burger here but was feeling like I wanted something lighter and went with the Marco Pollo Chicken Burger, which still finds a way to pack in the calories.

We ordered the food which tasted so bad( I can't dream of)and we were lucky they gave small quantity so we were able to finish somehow. The fries, pretzel bites and onion rings have so much of oil floating (worst).

6,Lefai K.,"Chicago, IL",282,636,421.0,4.0,2017-01-31,"I love me some burgers. I haven't been to Red Robin in awhile but this place is consistent. So many burger options, but I always gravitate to bleu cheese because bleu cheese is so delicious. This time around though, I decided to do something different andwent with the Prime Chophouse burger.  The burger had sautéed mushrooms, provolone, dijon mustard, and crispy onion straws on an onion bun... all topped with a nice and tangy, but not over-powering steak sauce. I had mine cooked ""medium"" and it was cooked perfectly. I paired it with some garlic fries and it was a lunch that hit the spot. The waitress/server was nice and attentive, although I had to ask her twice for some mustard, but overall, everything was all-good. BATHROOM REVIEW: Located near the inside mall entrance, the bathroom was in decent shape. Everything was clean and in working order. The toilet itself looked kind of sketchy, so I'd go with the good ol' squat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schaumburg,2.96,3.36,3.36,,3.2

But either time the consistency was the same, the food came out at a consistent time and it was well worth the wait(whatever it was) because the burgers were great and were cooked to specification(medium-rare I think it was my case if I remember right). This particular Red Robins honestly... Was pretty cool on the inside. Yep that's right, cool, it was cool on the inside. The wait staff was professional and friendly and the checkout experience was very easy and it was easy to include the tip on there, no complaints overall, I'm very happy with my experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schaumburg?start=20,3.0,3.36,3.36,,3.2160000000000006

12,Prabodh M.,"Wheeling, IL",21,36,20.0,2.0,2017-05-04,"This Red Robin outlet was disappointing. We went there on Sunday late afternoon. It was crowded with around 30 minute wait. That was not a problem since the Woodfield mall is an amazing place to spend time. We ordered the Spinach and Artichoke dip and Burning Love. The dip was not that great. The artichoke pieces on the bottom of the dip seemed stale.The burger was quite soggy and not like the one I am used to at other Red Robin outlets. The fried jalapeno pepper that comes on the top of the burger was soggy as well. It looked like it had been fried in the morning. Usually the pepper is crunchy and fried fresh and is why I always order that burger. The service was good none the less.

2,Phil S.,"Sauganash, Chicago, IL",127,519,3655.0,2.0,2017-07-13,"Yesterday I was out at Woodfield and saw that Red Robin had a special on their burgers for $6.99.  Too good a deal to believe so I called my sister and we made the trek out to The Woodfield Red Robin.  Her from da suburbs Vernon Hills and me from da NW side of da city.   Well as it turns out this burger was a huge disappointment absolutely nothing like the burger I ordered at the Niles Red Robin.  Where I ordered in Niles I ordered the Smoke & Pepper angus burger on a ciabatta bun w/cheddar cheese, bacon & bbque sauce cooked medium rare.  Now that was a great burger!! We can both stand to shed a few pounds me more so then her so in keeping with that we decided to split the burger and a Cobb salad.  I ordered one of the 4 pub burgers that was included in the $6.99 price range.  The picture on the ad showed a double burger w/cheese oozing out, crispy onion rings sandwiched in w/tomatoes, lettuce & Sriracha sauce.  She ordered the Cobb salad which was also equally disappointing.  Normally I'm not a fan of the thick cut steak fries, but served hot and dipped in ranch they were pretty good.  My sister also had a complimentary Oreo cookie milk shake that we split (uhh so much for the diet ).  The burger that came out was a poor representation of the burger in the photo flattened into what looked more like a McDonald's double cheeseburger.  It was tasty, but a huge disappointment.  The Cobb salad was also bland w/tiny pieces of unripened avocado, toast that were tasteless along with a piece of chicken that was actually pretty tasty, but overall the salad was very disappointing. The hostess put us in the back section away from the section with all the kids (kind of like a Chucky Cheese).  The service wasn't the greatest.  We were seated, ordered our food including the Oreo shake that we split wo/any napkins or utensils.  I told her we just bobbed for our food so we didn't need any utensils.  Well we did finally get our utensils after my sister searched out to a different server and I went to the bar to grab some napkins it was game on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schaumburg,2.88,3.32,3.32,,3.144

4,Adrian G.,"Algonquin, IL",17,29,72.0,4.0,2017-10-28,Overall my wife and I really enjoy Red Robin burgers. To be honest the size of the burgers have gone down a lot since 2010's but the flavors are the same. The meat is juicy (sometimes too greasy in my opinion depending on what you order) but overall Red Robin is a place we visit fairly frequently especially when we visit Woodfield Mall. Their nachos are very good but again the portion is pretty small in my opinion. My favorite burger is the burning love which comes with jalapeños. My wife likes their tavern double burgers. The drinks are good and tower of onion rings are always impressive. If you never have been to Red Robin you definitely should check it out and see what you think of it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schaumburg,2.92,3.31,3.31,,3.154

0,Angela S.,"Highland Park, IL",2426,776,6569.0,4.0,2018-01-06,"There was a time in my life where New Year's Eve consisted of more than a trip to the mall and dinner at a fast food chain, but our service by Danny was a top notch fancy five stars combined with some awesome family time. I'm a little embarrassed to admit that I've never been to a Red Robin before my visit to this location. I always figured it was like a Hardees or some really subpar fast food joint. I honestly had no idea it was a more ""upscale"" burger joint.  On New Year's Eve it was too cold to go to the Lincoln Park Zoo Lights, so we took the kiddos to Woodfield Mall to catch some last minute sales and find a spot to hang out. After shopping, and by the time we were about to leave, everyone was cranky hungry so we decided to stick around and eat at Red Robin. It was a nice experience, especially since the place was full with lots of other families.  Danny was our server and came immediately to our table after we pressed the call button on the machine. He was so nice and helped us navigate the menu. We came for the gourmet cheeseburger specials that consisted of two thin patties of beef and unlimited fries (ummmm, yes please). He let us make minor substitutions, and our burgers came out charbroiled with excellent flavor. I'm a thin french fry lover, but I thoroughly enjoyed the potato goodness offered here by the unlimited seasoned steak fries. We were promptly served, the atmosphere was fun, and our food and service rocked! Thanks Red Robin. I'm pretty sure we found our new stop during our random Woodfield Mall visits. Perhaps a New Year's Eve tradition?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schaumburg,3.36,3.32,3.32,,3.3360000000000003
