39,Christian K.,"Schererville, IN",408,393,3182.0,3.0,2013-04-05,"Red Robin is a decent burger joint, kinda overrated sometimes but there's nothing to complain about. When this location opened up years back it was packed all the time, now it seems that folks kinda got used to it, even when we went on a Saturday night it just seemed kinda empty.  They've got a lot of different burgers, there's was one with ghost pepper ketchup - not sure if it's there all the time or if it was just a seasonal thing, anyways though it's pretty good if your into burning your face off.  The Royal Red Robin is my go to when there's a large hunger to be satisfied. Your basic burger topped with a fried egg and bacon. The egg yolk totally brings it. If you're not too hungry, you might opt for the Tavern Double, a lot smaller than the regular burgers but definitely not as tasty since it's just your basic cheeseburger... maybe ask 'em to add some toppings or something to kick it up a notch? The Onion Tower... cool, super fried but super greasy sometimes - hit or miss here.  They have a few craft beers, Upland, Three Floyd's and Angry Orchard. Ask the server about the other two... I can't remember them.  Speaking of servers - we've usually had pretty consistent service, quick, non rushed and friendly. Again, nothing super special, but consistently good. Red Robin is good, not amazing or anything but it's consistent. When my cousin comes into town we always seem to gravitate towards this one, call it tradition? or lack of creative choices available? Both maybe? Either way... it IS on the quick choice list - the one where if you can't decide where else to go... ""this'll do"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schererville,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003,2.7960000000000003

4,Thomas G.,"Dyer, IN",0,15,,1.0,2013-10-16,"I used to love going here. Great burgers and fries. Good family restaurant. Last 2 times at this location I've experienced awful service. VERY SLOW. My last visit was so bad that after speaking with the area manager he apologized and sent me a $20 gift card. I was very appreciative of the gesture and decided to use it for this current review.  CURRENT VISIT. When the restaurant is LESS THAN HALF FULL it shouldn't take almost 30 minutes to get 2 burgers.   HERE IS WHAT HAPPENED DURING MY LAST VISIT. At the time of arrival the restaurant was a little more than half full. 4 people in the party. We ordered 2 burgers a chicken sandwich and a salad. 25 minutes later the server brings a second round of drinks and says he's going to check on the order. More than 45 minutes after placing our order he comes up and says, ""Sorry it's taking so long but they're holding the order because they don't know what kind of cheese to put on the chicken sandwich."" (Seriously?) In the meantime other customers seated after us have eaten and left. While walking out I exercised common courtesy and told the manager what had transpired and that we were leaving. She said, ""Your food is coming up now. Would you like it to go?"" I told her to throw it away. She then said, ""Well...you don't have to pay for your drinks."" (Really? Gee thanks. You compted 3 sodas & a water) I said, ""I wasn't going to."" Then we walked out. The manager never even offered to pay for the food.  Not sure what's going on at this particular Red Robin but I know from my last 2 times there that the service is ridiculously and unexplicably slow.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schererville?start=40,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006,2.6600000000000006

Well it took a little longer so we started eating and I was just telling my oldest daughter how they had most likely forgotten the pizza when the nice manager came to my daughter and said no little girl should be waiting for her food while everyone eats.

Burger was delicious.  It comes with the garlic mayo dip that goes well with the bottomless fries.  Everything was cooked well, and overall, I was satisfied with the service.  I wish the upper management didn't watch the server and guests with their giant hawk eyes and gave us more peaceful time to munch our meals.  I hope the day went well for the server and she received great accolades from her bosses.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schererville?start=20,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003,2.8640000000000003

8,Jennifer C.,"Aurora, IL",0,3,,2.0,2014-12-26,"I've been to many Red Robins and I've never had bad service at a Red Robin until today. My boyfriend and I sat in the bar area around 2:30, so not busy lunch time or busy dinner time. However, it took around 10 minutes to even get greeted by our waitress and another 5 minutes just to get menus. There were about 3 waitresses and a bartender who were working the section, yet taking care of 6 tables seemed just too overwhelming for them. When the waitresses weren't pretending to work, they were chatting with the male bartender. We ordered margaritas, not super complicated cocktails, correct? Guess what? It took us 20 minutes for us to receive our very simple and unimpressive margaritas! When we were finally able to order our food, it was north of 40 minutes before we had our food in front of us. We were very frustrated and just wanted to get it all over with. Our table neighbors ordered a lemonade and iced tea, then ordered their meals. During the whole process of us waiting and eating, all they had were their drinks! They did not arrive that long after us. They were discussing whether or not they should tell the waitress to cancel their food order because they were so upset. I really enjoy the Red Robin franchise, but was sadly disappointed on what was supposed to be an enjoyable day off.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schererville?start=40,2.504,2.504,2.504,2.504,2.504

42,Leslie L.,"Schererville, IN",64,366,371.0,3.0,2015-01-10,"We went on a slow night and my hubby and I both ordered a burger and the fries. Despite it being dead, it took quite some time for the bartender to get our drinks. I started reading yelp reviews and set a timer after our orders were taken (took about 10 min for them to take our order) It took 28 minutes for our burgers and fries. They brought my hubby the wrong fries (he wanted sweet potato) so it took time to get those. If you get cold in the winter and you are looking for warmth, DO NOT sit in the bar! I was freezing! The draft kept coming in every time a new person came in. The fries were good but they are thick. Bottomless fries, wow great right? I didn't get a refill 'cause I was stuffed! Neither did the hubby. Burgers were tasty and I did like mine. Honestly though the appetizers look good and I might come back to eat those and drink. The burgers and fries were okay in my book but nothing I would rush out to get. One thing I did notice and was a little odd was that my burger came in a basket, wrapped in foil like a fast food burger while my hubby's burger came on a nice platter. I asked the waiter/bartender and he said that it was because my hubby had gotten the higher quality burger. Very odd because my burger wasn't that much cheaper than his. Sorry Red Robin chain guys, that isn't that attractive to me. I see what you did there but it's not like my burger was 2.99 and his was 10.00. The bartender/waiter was really nice and friendly though. He was upbeat and had a good personality.

36,Nicholas D.,"Highland, IN",83,1,1.0,3.0,2015-11-16,"last weekend I went to the restaurant called ""Red Robin"". I noticed many things about Red Robin. When I first walked into the franchise, the place looked very clean. I walked into the bathroom and I was so surprised on how clean it was I didn't even see a spot of dirt anywhere. After I was seated at my booth I looked at the table.           It was kind of dirty their were little crumbs all over the table like they didn't wash it,which is very nasty. the atmosphere was pretty lively. I saw tons of family's eating together and some Groups of friends. It was loud from hearing the family's talk and the music from the speakers was loud. The bar was loud from all the drunken fans cheering for their favorite team on the tv. Red robin does take reservations but not to many people come in via reservations. The service was excellent, the waiter didn't let my soda get close to empty, he literally checked on me like every five minutes.        Red Robin is open 11 am to 11 pm at night , 7 days a week. The prices vary for all dishes, prices vary from 9 dollars to 16 dollars. Red Robin serves all kinds of American foods such as Hamburgers,chicken strips,and salads.i personally got the chicken tenders, they were really good the only thing that disappointed me about them is I only got three of them for 9.99$ which is kind of a rip off.

In a nutshell it was overpriced, overcooked, and had questionable service at best. I came here with a friend for an early dinner before we went to go see a movie at the nearby theater. I'd only been here once before, so I was looking forward to it. The commercials always make it look so amazing; I wish that's how this would have went! I ordered a pretty safe bet, the Crispy Chicken sandwich ($9.99). It's a fried chicken patty topped with pickles, onions, lettuce, tomato, and mayo. I ordered mine with no onions.  Our waitress started out nice enough, but the service was so slow. It took nearly 45 minutes for our food to come out.  And when it got to the table, it was a disaster. I checked the toppings on my sandwich and sure enough, there was onions. No big deal. It's a preference, not an allergy so I was a big girl and picked them off myself. But then I bit into the sandwich... The chicken was like a hockey puck. Not just that initial delicious crunch of a good breading, but meat and all. It was tough and nearly inedible. Our waitress wasn't interested in hearing about it, and seemed to ignore when we asked to talk to someone who *might actually* care. It wasn't worth pushing further for us, so we just paid and left. I'm not happy that I paid $10+ for a meal that I couldn't enjoy, and that wasn't even correct to the order I placed.

I had never heard of this restaurant before, so I didn't have very high expectations. Direct seating at a table with comfortable chairs. Nice selection of dishes which suited the whole family. Friendly and knowledgeable waiter. The food came quite fast and was cooked to perfection. They tried to sell us the bottomless drink fountain twice, but we were all trying to stay healthy so we had water. Yummy and huge mud pie for dessert. One order was enough for the four of us!

We were seated right away and greeted by a waitress who too our drink order. Soon after she brought our drinks and took our order. A salad, turkey sandwich and soup, Mac N cheese and tenders for my children. It took 25 minutes! I think that was way to long for what we ordered especially when the rest wasn't even busy! When we finally received our food it was good, but my daughter barely received our fries and the waitress didn't offer any more. My husband's soup was a joke. The size was ridiculously small. For what we had, the quality and the wait.....it was WAY overpriced. I really feel that since Red Robin revamped their restaurants and menus it has really gone downhill. Not sure if I'll be back.

No napkins, asked for light ice in our drinks but both glasses came to the table full of ice? The pig out burger came with no bacon???!?!?!? Lol the fries wasn't hot. The smoke and pepper burger, where do I start...first, they didn't have the burger patty for this specific burger so the server said that the manager was granting 2 6oz patties to accommodate the mishap. It was cool, received the burger, it was alright. In the description of the burger, it stated peppercorn bacon, the bacon was regular bacon. Then to top it all off, we was charge for the burger patty that the manager was supposedly to ""grant"" since they ran out of the original patty that was supposed to be served.  The server herself literally stood at one particular table and talked to the guest at the table for almost 20 minutes while she had another table that just got sat, didn't greet them or anything of that sort. Once we was done with the first round of fries, it took a another 15 minutes to receive exactly 10 fries????!?!?!?!?!?

49,Crystal K.,"Saint John, IN",0,3,,3.0,2017-03-18,"I have never been a fan of Red Robin because I know it's overpriced and the food, as I remember, was very greasy. My friend and I walked in and the host was taking names for a wait list. We asked if we could sit in the bar as there were many tables and seats open in the bar area. The host said yes and we followed him into the bar. About half way into the bar the other hostess came up and said we weren't allowed to sit there so we turned around and waited up front to be seated. They did not take our name and said it would only be about 5 minutes. After about 20 minutes of waiting another family came in and asked to sit at the bar that was empty and was angered because the host told them there was a wait list, the hostess (the one who had told us we could not be seated) told the family she could seat them. In total we waited 30 minutes to sit at the bar. The service was great however! Our waiters name was ZJ and even though he was very busy he was absolutely wonderful. He didn't make us feel rushed and was very quick and on top of it! The drink and food I ordered was actually really good to my surprise, but maybe because after such the long wait I was so hungry I could've thought anything was good!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schererville?start=20,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68

She is the most down to earth and attentive waitress you will ever have. She makes you feel VIP each and every time. We love the bottomless fries and especially with garlic added.

Red Robin's big selling point is their bottomless fries.  I got fries with my burger, but there were barely any there.  Honestly there was maybe eight fries.  After finishing these, I requested more and got eight more fries.  It was honestly a hassle and I left rather than continue to order more fries because it was just not worth my time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-schererville,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6
