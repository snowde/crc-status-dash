80,Elias A.,"Scottsdale, AZ",87,123,81.0,3.0,2012-05-09,I was here for a business dinner recently and loved their new hummus plate.  They put grilled zucchini on it and had some fresh jicama which was awesome.  I wasn't in the mood for BBQ at the time but so I ordered a turkey burger which came on a whole wheat bun and some steamed broccoli.  I love the healthy options.  Thanks to Red Robin for helping to fight the battle of the bulge.  Just make sure you bring lots of will power when come here because it's easy to blow it...especially with the desert menu!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-scottsdale?start=80,3.1480000000000006,3.1480000000000006,3.1480000000000006,3.1480000000000006,3.1480000000000006
44,Chris S.,"Tempe, AZ",298,569,1415.0,3.0,2012-05-10,"This is a safe place to eat a burger, and not wanting to be the adventurous type that night I opted to go to Red Robin. Walking in was kind of a pain as we waited for a few minutes to be seated, it was one of those where's the waitress or anybody?? front of the house. Finally a man walked out from the abyss in the back and seated us. FYI in case you have never been: bottomless root beer floats for $3 and bottomless fries with any burger. Sometimes the steak fries are too soggy as you get nearer the bottom of the basket and some of them may be way too over salted, just a warning. The thousand island dressing that came with my patty melt was great, almost felt like asking what brand it was. If you are a vegetarian, they offer either Morningstar or Boca substitutions.  It didn't appear that there were very many people in the restaurant but the service was okay despite this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-scottsdale?start=60,3.2120000000000006,3.2120000000000006,3.2120000000000006,3.2120000000000006,3.212000000000001

27,Marc T.,"Scottsdale, AZ",522,129,361.0,2.0,2012-09-01,"Well, damn. Until tonight, all of our experiences at Red Robin had been positive. Even at this location, our past meals had been enjoyable. Tonight, though...tonight left a sour taste in my mouth. That's not to say that the food was bad...it was actually pretty good. But the service was atrocious. We thought it was our lucky day when we walked right in on a Saturday night and sat right down at 7:00. We ordered our appetizer and drinks. The waiter, Cameron, came back and took our order a few moments later. Our appetizer came out in record time! We had hardly taken a few bites of our hummus plate, and then our food came out! Like I said...the food was good. So, where was the horrible service? The food was there fast, hot, and it was good. What could have bothered me so much? Well, I don't think the waiter said more than a dozen words to us. It seemed like he was late for something very important, and we were his last obstacle to overcome before he was able to free himself from the self-imposed bonds of servitude to Red Robin. Customarily, the waiter comes around after the food arrives and asks how things tasted. This guy didn't show up until our food was gone, our drinks were gone, and we were ready for the check and couple of to-go boxes. He begrudgingly gave me a refill on my drink before he dropped off the check. Now, granted, we don't ever get desert in a restaurant...but this guy didn't even give us the satisfaction of turning down his delicious sounding proposal. The whole process felt like we were imposing on this kid. We were in and out of the restaurant in less than 30 minutes.  This guy robbed us of the entire restaurant experience. If you can't enjoy the experience, then why go? It will definitely be a while (if ever) before I visit this location again. But I can promise that I'll avoid this kid like the plague if he's still ""working against his will"" at this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-scottsdale?start=40,2.9520000000000004,2.9520000000000004,2.9520000000000004,2.9520000000000004,2.952000000000001

42,Dann S.,"Phoenix, AZ",171,83,966.0,4.0,2013-04-25,"Sometimes life is a compromise. Like when my lunch buddies at work want to drag me to Applebee's or Chili's or some junk like that for lunch, I'll compromise with Red Robin. We're still talking junky food from all the same venders but at least they have bottomless steak fries and other perks.   The biggest advantage of eating here is that I can get a Royal Red Robin Burger. Basically this means a regular hamburger with an egg laid on top of it. How awesome is that? If you know anything about me, you know that I love fried eggs on top of anything; pancakes, beef, asian rice bowls, anything!  Okay so yeah, the egg, it's awesome. Let's talk about what's not awesome. Lettuce. Order this thing without lettuce and you will thank me in the morning. I mean something so beautiful is an egg on a hamburger doesn't need to be ruined by warm vegetation! The description says crisp lettuce? That is lies and we both know it. Just say no to lettuce.   Some other ideas for this sandwich are: Sprinkle some of that Red Robin seasoning on it. It's pretty good. Order it with a chocolate milkshake. That can't be bad.  Oh and Red Robin's has a pretty sweet deal where their French fries are all you can eat, or as I like to call it, the kids eat for free special. So if you have like 20 effin' kids, please take them here and feed them all these French fries, meanwhile you get to mow down on this tasty sammich.

84,Anne W.,"Phoenix, AZ",649,230,6.0,2.0,2013-11-20,"Where to begin, well the host was very friendly and sat us a booth in the bar. Our server took a while to come over to us even though there weren't hardly any people there. My dad had applied for some Red Robin's club card and he was to get a free appetizer for applying for it. They had issues getting his confirmation code to work though and instead of being helpful- like just giving the free appetizer- they said they couldn't do anything to help us and gave my dad some RR card help line to call, even though by then it was closed.. They did not offer us the appetizer and weren't very helpful.  Then we ordered drinks which took a while and then we finally got to order dinner. The dinner came out and I had a smaller burger but it still came with bottomless fries. Me, being the fry-lover that I am ate all of my (smaller portion) of fries. I asked for more. We waited for 20 mins and still no fries. I eventually had the server cancel the extra order (since they were to be bottomless) and got the check. It was poor service on their part. The server did apologize after I asked for the check. He ignored us for the most part though, which made me mad since it wasn't busy in the bar area at all.

10,David P.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,184,,2.0,2016-03-30,"I've been a Red Robin customer since the mid 80s. But, those days are done. In the last couple years, sadly, they have gone down hill dramatically. This is true for locations not only in metro Phoenix but southern CA, too. Burgers seem smaller. I won't argue with their decision to change how they serve their ""endless"" fries. You can still have all you want - it's just a lot less likely that pounds and pounds of potatoes will go to waste like they must have in the past. The service is inconsistent. When I was last at this location, late on a weeknight, the place was dead. Many tables needed to be cleaned but no one seemed to care. I was seated in the bar area despite specifically asking for dining room. The bartender himself served me. He was nice, but he had a bar to tend. No doubt he (accurately) figured his better chance for tip money was his bar customers so I was a bit ignored with dirty tables all around me. I do appreciate they use real ice cream. Mixing chocolate and raspberry is simply amazing. Sadly, not all servers understand how to make this happen. Sometimes I get one flavor in the glass cup and the other in the metal cup. I didn't want a chocolate shake AND a raspberry shake. One time I got one flavor and my companion got the other. When they blend it right, then there is nothing better in life in terms of a milkshake. I can't think of the name of the automated interactive system they've implemented. I really do not like this. I could see the system being perfect in a busy bar for faster service and table turns. But, in Red Robin? Come on, just let a server come by and take my order. Let a runner serve me. Then check in from time to time without needing to be summoned - electronically or otherwise. Oh, and that tip calculator it has? Makes it easy to short the server because they aren't really servers any more. Too bad.  Many other choices now for much better burgers at not-too-much-more prices. And, those other places have human beings as servers who are polite and friendly. Kind of like what Red Robin used to be.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-scottsdale?start=20,3.08,3.08,3.08,2.472,3.0800000000000005

60,Melvin J.,"Phoenix, AZ",8,19,26.0,5.0,2017-10-13,"RED ROBIN! YUMMMMM. I dined here today, to recieve my Free Birthday Burger. The burger I chose, was the A.1.® Peppercorn burger. My server Angelita, suggested Garlic Herbed Fries for my side. Both items were fantastic. That A.1. sauce & the onion roll, truly added to the flavor of the meal. My Royalty Membership, sure brought the price down. I'm looking forward, to returning in the near future, and trying one of their Brew Infusions. Till then, CHEERS!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-scottsdale,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004
4,Paul T.,"St. Johnsbury, VT",0,7,,1.0,2017-11-09,"Unfortunately, our party of four had an experience here that brought new meaning to the word ""pathetic"".  Upon receiving our menus, we asked for a copy of the dietary guide.  Seven minutes later, when asked when it was coming, our waitress replied, ""Oh, just a few more minutes.""  I complained to the manager that this was totally unacceptable, and he assured me it would be at the table forthwith.  The waitress showed up with her version of the dietary guide...a list of  the calories in the desserts.  She obviously had no idea what it was. Totally useless.  We had one person in the party who is extremely sensitive to salt.  That's all we needed, the sodium information.  Finally, the manager brought it to us.  The waitress seemed to have nothing but problems in taking our orders (uh, we were not that difficult a party, believe me), and we were assured that one of us could have burger and fries without the salt.  Well, three of the orders came out.  The saltless order did not.  We AGAIN spoke to the manager, who mentioned that the kitchen screwed it up, and she jumped in the line and made it herself for us...however, this was 10 minutes after the rest of the food had arrived. Let me sum up the rest of the evening...the manager again apologized and said we would not be charged for the meal.  Uh, we WERE charged for it, so we again complained.  What a horrible evening, truly.  The combined, almost concerted ineptness of the staff truly helped to ensure a negative experience.  We will never, ever set foot in a Red Robin again.  Ever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-scottsdale?start=20,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004
68,Ken M.,"Rio Verde, AZ",0,23,,1.0,2017-11-15,"Wow, talk about downhill. We went to this location years ago and it was nice.  Decided to try it 11/14/ 2017. Huge disappointment. Arrived at 4:15 to 4:30 and found the parking lot and restaurant almost empty. Clue #1. We were seated at a table. Most tables, chairs and the floor were covered with old food crumbs, etc. we were the only ones in the section until two others sat down with the purse ""service dog"" which was now on the table. There seemed to be enough staff to clean but that wasn't happening. Maybe they were waiting til closing time. The food, just average. Done with Red Robin, well at least this one. There are better restaurants out there who would love more business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-scottsdale,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004
66,Mike S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",0,7,,1.0,2017-11-18,"The one consistent theme at this location is horrible service.  We have been here at least 10 times, mostly because our little one liked their food, but I can't remember a time when the service was great or even average. Interestingly, in reading many of the other less than stellar reviews here, the common complaint is POOR SERVICE.  Get a clue RR!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-scottsdale,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004
73,Larry E.,"Fountain Hills, AZ",0,1,,1.0,2017-12-03,The food has gone from bad to worse the burger meat is gray in color which makes me wonder what it is. My last visit was raw hamburger and the manager called it a bit too pink. My family has been going to this Red Robin for over 20 years. Seems to me this is a problem everywhere charge more for less and I am willing to pay for a good product elsewhere.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-scottsdale,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004
61,MaryAnn B.,"Glendale, AZ",26,4,,1.0,2017-12-17,"Ordered Online for pick up last night.  Food was overcooked and the guy who packed up our food (from the bar) obviously did not care about what we actually ordered.    When we got home, I was upset since I had specifically ordered condiments for 2 full orders of fish & chips, so I expected to have some tartar for the fish.  Nope.  Flatware, nope.  Cocktail sauce.  nope. I guess next time I will have to double, triple check our orders before leaving.   And I was wondering why NO ONE was there.  Now I know.  I should have checked them out on Yelp first.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-scottsdale,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004
