Steaks, rare, but red ground beef makes me icky. Josh ordered his medium rare. Ours were the exact same. The burger also had no flavour at all. The manager offered to make me another, but I had no desire to wait. Our tables were uncomfortable, at weird heights. Too tall for me, 5'5 and too short for Josh, 6'1. We've never had that problem before. I have no idea what's up with those seat. Plus, there were 18 (I counted) children sitting all around us. EVERY family there had 2+ kids, SCREAMING. The manager gave me my dinner free, since I didn't eat it anyway. That was nice at least. Oh, also, the side of broccoli in place of fries is a cup the size of cough syrup dose cups.

The times that I've gone, my dining experiences have been pleasant and the servers pretty attentive when you can get their attention. I've gone recently during lunch hours in which we never had to wait for a seat, guess it depends on the day and times you come in. Just wanted to say that I ordered the Chicken Caprese Sandwich which is a tender grilled chicken breast topped with fresh Mozzarella cheese, balsamic marinated tomatoes and crisp romaine lettuce. Served on rustic ciabatta bread with pesto aioli. LOVED it! Im glad the server recommended it because it fills you up and you can split it with a friend.  I love the unlimited fries, especially adding the Red Robin spices to it.

I asked to have my burger made a certain way and also remove the seasoning from the burger. The waitress took it one step further and had an entire batch of fries made without the seasoning.

If I was them I would have assumed we were homeless and not paid us any mind.  So, in order to escape the bankruptcy inducing food prices at Six Flags, we did not eat at Six Flags. I was STARVING. My sister wanted to half a salad. Boo, you straight trippin. We have a diet thingy going on so she was just looking out, I get it. We settled on bottomless steak fries and half a salad. This appeased my conscience and stomach; I try not to eat too much beef as it is.  Cue waitress, Sarah. On top of EVERYTHING. I've done my share of waitressing back in the day, and I was blown away. Have you ever had a waitress that you had to ask to STOP giving refills of sodas, chips, bottomless fries, etc., because you were done? My glass was never empty, I was never wanting for more fries. My Nazi of a sister commanded her to take away the fries after the 3rd round, saying we'd had enough, while staring directly at me. Geez, I get it. I must add that the Twisted Caesar salad was amaaaaazing, you wouldn't understand how perfectly cooked chicken and macaroni noodles added to a Caesar salad can blow your mind until you've had this. So, we're asked if we need to-go cups as we wrap it up. No thank you, I had more than my usual share of refills of water and fries. My sister picked up the bill, but I was half tempted to throw my card in for a tip. I know my babysis took good care of her, but service like that deserves no less than 40% MINIMUM. I'm still blown away by the attentiveness of this girl. If my usual waitress Tara is absent (who is also magnificent by the way), Sarah, you are my new backup.

Shortly after sitting down there were two groups of two and a group of three seated...so I walked up to be seated and she asked how many (I know not everyone is remembered but we had literally just been infront of her and were sitting 5 ft away) so I irritatedly said-3. The hostess looked around and had the other hostess go clean off a table real quick so we could sit down. Meanwhile what looked to be the manager in a purple button up shirt, was right next to the hostess desk, drawing on a paper. We go to order food and my son wanted pizza and a side of Mac and cheese, the waitress acted confused and said I'd have to pay for another kids meal of Mac, I said I just wanted to add the side from the adult menu. She was very confused I guess so my son just said ""I'll take fries"" as he saw she was confused too...he's 9. The waitress did bring us fries before our food came which was a plus.

61,Azri G.,"Shinjuku, Japan",34,13,131.0,4.0,2014-08-18,"I have always received great service at Red Robin, but one instance especially stands out to me. I am a student, so I don't have much money, and my family is rather poor. It is thus very rare for us to have the opportunity to go out to eat at a restaurant together, or for me to be able to go to one with my boyfriend who is also a student. So I was a bit disappointed that one night when we picked up Red Robin for dinner I opened my box at home to discover the burger looking a bit out of order. It was squished, greasy, over cooked, had some things on it I had asked to have taken off, and was overall less than desired. I called Red Robin, not expecting much since we had ordered late and by the time we got home was after 9pm. I was able to speak with a manager who apologized profusely for the food's condition and requested an opportunity to make it up to us. He got my information and had vouchers sent to me in the mail for two free entrees so we would be able to have our dinner together. He had handwritten a note inside to me, and the evidence he had taken the time to take care of me was deeply appreciated. Having as little as we do, it meant so much that he cared enough to make sure we got that dinner. Unfortunately I misplaced the vouchers so I never got to go back, and it is pretty expensive so I would love the opportunity, but this is a great place. I am counting down a star because the original food was displeasing and the price is high (i.e. $5 for a shake).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-selma?start=60,3.56,3.56,3.56,2.576,3.5600000000000005

32,Mad A.,"Austin, TX",333,116,136.0,5.0,2014-12-23,"This review needs to go into my category of ""Chain Restaurants That Rock"". I have eaten at Red Robin Burger places from time to time throughout the South and Texas and have never eaten bad food at one. But I saved my review for this location because in my experience it has been the best overall in terms of service and quality of food. It's a tad pricey for a burger but so are a lot of other places.  It could be that my timing is just good because the times I have eaten here has been after the lunchtime crowd or early when they just get started before the big rush hits. Once before the lunch rush and two times afterwards. Never a problem. I always get the same thing at Red Robin. Beer, side salad, and the BURNIN' LOVE BURGER, Babeee! Hell yes! And I always get the DOUBLE! And the meat is delicious.  Here we go so stand witness!: Burnin' Love Burger: crisply fried jalapeno coins, tangy salsa and spicy pepper-jack cheese layered on top of a cayenne-seasoned burger. Lettuce and fresh tomatoes to served on a jalapeno-cornmeal kaiser roll with chipotle mayo. WHOO! Great flavors and that blend together.... like.. you know.. love. And their fries are damn tasty too. Fresh and hot ! QUICK FRENCH FRY TIP: Get them to bring you a side cup of their Chipotle Mayo to dip those fries instead of ketchup.  And while a love relationship may let you down from time to time.. the Burnin' Love Burger has never disappointed me. In fact, the Burnin' Love Burger has never tried to break into my email account, psychotically spied on my phone text messages, ripped up photos of former girlfriends from YEARS ago when they were tucked out of site in a shoebox with other photos, tried to talk shit about me to my friends, called my momma to complain about me, slashed my car tires, broken into my home, nor tried to cock block a new relationship. Just sayin'. This burger is of the Burnin' Love variety that is selfless and soul nurturing and I  actually feel calm after a late afternoon quickie lunch date. And satisfied too.  Red Robin also keeps a decent line of whiskeys and such. They are not all snobby top end types of liquor ..oh you righteous snobs of such indulgences. But remember that you did come to a burger place. Right? You did remember that? So SHADDAPP!! Please save your faux ""I'm Gordon Ramsey and just watched a cooking show"" review writer bullshit for a more appropriate review. Mmmkaay?  Red Robin gets a five star review for being good at what it does. Ya know..just being a chain burger place and doing it well. Beer, Burger, Fries. And a whiskey afterwards if you want one.

37,Tami S.,"San Antonio, TX",34,103,79.0,4.0,2015-08-14,"4 stars for consistency! great food and service!  I'll start by saying that Red robin's burgers are a little toward the pricier side, and the almost $3 drinks add up for a family of 4, but that said, the burgers are always top notch. Great flavor combos, well prepared.  I also like the healthier bun, bun free, side swap options - great if you are trying to shave off some calories. Tonight I decided to try the about-Cobb-o salad instead of a burger. My expectations weren't high - salads seem like a ""throw-away"" item at some restaurants. I end up digging out old, brown pieces of lettuce, or the salad tastes like old, bagged lettuce. it its just plain iceberg - you get the point. BUT what I GOT was a REALLY fresh, and REALLY good salad! The grilled chicken was very flavorful and not the least bit dry or rubbery. and there was a nice variety of lettuce along with generous portions of diced tomatoes, cucumbers, sliced avocado, bacon and blue cheese crumbles. The accompanying garlic toast was also yummy. NICE surprise at a ""burger"" restaurant. May be a hard choice for me next time - burger or salad!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-selma?start=20,3.4,3.4,3.4,2.384,3.4000000000000004

When we were seated, we noticed that several tables all throughout the restaurant needed to be bussed. There were at least three tables in our section that had half eaten food and drinks sitting on it. We ordered and the food came out in a reasonable amount of time. I got my spiced pumpkin pie shake first, and it was delicious! It tasted like a real pumpkin pie. Next came the food, and I laughed at the amount of turkey in my BLTA Croissant. There were three slices of turkey...just three thin, sad slices. What a rip off. I chose bottomless fruit salad instead of fries, trying to eat a little healthier, and it came drenched in a syrupy sauce. Darn. My husband's Smokin Pepper burger was great and cooked properly, so that's a plus. He was also disappointed in the sugary sweetened fruit salad. By the time we got up to leave, about 40 minutes later, every single table that needed to be bussed when we walked in was STILL dirty. It was pretty unappetizing to look at all the dirty tables while trying to enjoy our meal. Apparently no one was bussing tables; we never saw anyone do it.

The bottomless fries came out hot every time which is a rarity based on previous experiences at other locations. Speaking of locations, it's in a plaza area between two reference cities: San Antonio and Cibolo, TX.

They also have balloons for young kids which was great because my son wasn't in the most ""happy"" of moods when we visited. If you're coming to have an interview or a meeting, this is NOT the place. It gets loud when packed. If you're military, there are military discounts so make sure to pull out the ID card with your smiling face on it.

I ordered unsweet tea, which I have been informed was stupid because in the South everyone apparently wants diabetes so they put sugar in every damn thing so it's my own fault for expecting to get what I ordered, and I did get what I ordered. But then someone came by and unbeknownst to me filled my glass with syrup and I had to spit that disgusting concoction into the napkins they gave us.

The floor manager was nice but she could have removed the kids meal off the bill considering the pizza was cold. So my son refused to eat it. They tried to reheat it which never tastes the same. And usually when you order toppings on a pizza they should be cooked and not just tossed on top like a salad. What 2 yr old will eat raw mushrooms? I'll have to think long and hard before heading back there...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-selma,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004

2,Sandra V.,"San Antonio, TX",43,89,117.0,4.0,2017-11-29,"This location at the Forum is clean, friendly and fast in service. There are lots of burger choices and since we were on a low carb diet, we tried the burger with a lettuce wrap. It was a great, delicious choice and I opted for a salad instead of fries. Although, from previous trips- those fries are hard to pass up! I love how they have the seasoning salt on the table, so you can add as much as you want. They also have a wide variety of sauces- my favorite is the campfire sauce- a smoky, creamy bbq sauce. Red Robin has a fun ambiance with lots to look at and something on the menu for just about any appetite.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-selma,3.28,3.28,3.28,,3.2800000000000002
