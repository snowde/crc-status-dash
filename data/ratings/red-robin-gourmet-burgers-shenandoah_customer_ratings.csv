33,Tammy C.,"Kent, WA",118,138,89.0,2.0,2012-04-24,"First, I wonder if Red Robin management read Yelp reviews.  If so, I hope they read mine. Second, Red Robin is a Washington State staple.  We are very familiar with the product and service. Also, having been in the service industry we do know the ins and outs of service, front of house and also Red Robin service policy. We were fortunate enough to be promptly greeted and found a booth in the bar.  The bartender was also our server and when I pulled up my Yelp app to check in I showed her the low rating the Dirty Bird has.  Her immediate response was the typical Yelp is just for haters.  I informed her of my love for Yelp and how we have been relying on it since moving to a new area and actually found Yelp to be fairly accurate. Anyhooo... We ordered a promotional bacon burger and my current fave, the chicken caprese sandwich.  Soooo good and moist! Our beers were cold and our fries came out crispy like we asked. So what was the issue? Watching the front of the house. GROSS. We watched the following: * A server pull off his shoe and place his hand deeply inside said shoe. Searching deeper and deeper. A well-worked in shoe and his foot on the floor. * A waitress chatting up and completely distracting the hostesses all while she drank a milkshake from a glass. In uniform... On the clock. * Same waitress fanning her tip money.  * Hostess completely ignoring costumers. Not even a smile. Well, you get the idea. It was all just really bad form. Management needs to weed out these problems.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-shenandoah?start=40,3.1760000000000006,3.1760000000000006,3.1760000000000006,3.1760000000000006,3.176000000000001

I've frequented the Red Robin's in California, and they are a restaurant chain that always strikes me as a mediocre establishment.  The bottomless carbs, errm steak fries dusted with their Red Robin seasoning and ketchup are probably the hook that draws me in.

With his sense of humor and friendly demeanor, every visit by him to our table was pleasant and fun! My burger, the Red Robin cheeseburger, with the patty a little pink as per my request, was tasty and filling. I had to box that sucker up and take the remainder of it home; the burger was enormous!

Now, I haven't had every waiter there so I can't say everyone is not that great.  However we've had a few and they do not compare, in any shape or form, to Dan!  Now for the food, I can't say that they have the best burgers around however they are good and if you go with the Tavern Double, you can't beat the price.  Try their new cheese fries, they are delicious.  The secret sauce is what makes it. Remind us of animals fries from In-N-Out except with bacon!

When I say crave, I mean I passed up the Red Robin, drove around to see if anything else would fill my craving, then doubled back around to Red Robin. Well boy was I dissatisfied...or should I say disgusted. My BF and I both ordered Blue Moons on draft. The first thing I noticed was no orange slice... I figured ok whatever... But when I was about to take a 2nd sip of my beer I noticed something small and black floating in my beer. A bug. It was a bug... But not just any bug, to my delight it was a baby ROACH. Why I didn't get up and leave at that moment is beyond me. My BF picked it out and told the waiter and he brought me a new beer. I played it off all cool because I had really hyped this place up. Enter burger: my burger tasted good, it was a bacon cheeseburger, in which you can't really mess up. Until you find a LONG HAIR EMBEDDED IN YOUR BURGER!  Yup, that's what happened. I pulled out the longest hair imaginable out of my mouth. Disgusting.  Furthermore, my BF said his Lone Star burger had chunks of salt in it. Unbearably salty.  Oh and IF I wanted any thing more to eat from there, it would've never happened, because we never got offered bottomless fries.

Our burgers were overcooked to the point of being hard and dry. They don't want to make rare burgers anymore - I get it - but these were ridiculous. They may have started out as 1/4 pound patties but they ended up as three-ounce sawdust cakes. Seriously. My Lone Star Burger had blue cheese on it. If you're expecting pepper jack and get ambushed with a mouthful of blue cheese instead, there's no way to really recover from that. Any flavor from the guacamole and veggies was completely overpowered. Had our server checked back even once I'd have asked them to remake it. By the time we got his attention we were ready for the check. He said he would ask about taking it off the check (eventually they did) but we waited fifteen minutes for him to come back. It was obvious the chicken strips were overcooked from their dark brown color and sure enough they also were hard and dry. A basket of fries - unbelievably- had both hot fresh fries and cold ones from a different batch. Inexcusable. I ordered Dr. Pepper, my companion ordered unsweetened tea, and we both were served watery sweet tea instead. Another five minutes getting our server's attention to bring the right drinks and yet another five minutes until they came to our table. There just wasn't anything good about the meal but I'm giving two stars because, at least, everything appeared clean. That's the best I can do on this one.

The major craving was their French fries and I had three portions. Thank you Red Robin for having bottomless fries! If you aren't a huge fan of French fries they have Sweet Potato fries, a fruit salad and broccoli and all of those are bottomless as well.

I'm also a fan of having many unlimited options.  That includes some fruit, salad and even the fries. Most cool was the unlimited root beer floats for $5! Fries come in a few flavors and you can get premium sauces for dipping.  This time we ordered a Jump Starter Double...we picked the fried zucchini bites and fried jalapeno coins.  All in all, you had a decent amount of each to hit the table, and the dipping sauces provided were an adequate taste companion to the dish.  Neither the appetizer nor sauces were blow your socks off good. I ordered the Mac Tavern Burger, and all in all, the burger was a lot smaller than what I would expect for a burger.  I thought if you are offering a burger with macaroni and cheese on it, you should have mounds of it oozing off the entire burger, but there were barely any sights of it on the small patty!  In regards of taste, the burgers did have character, but nothing to truly right home about.  The menu truly is extensive. You can get salmon, burgers, chicken, under 600 calorie meals, etcetera.  Just for the record, I recommend signing up for their email club.  Had I opted to not dine in, they would have given me 35% off my bill via the email promotion.  Honestly, you have to love the concept of bottomless fries and bottomless drinks. Having unlimited options will ensure you leave full.  Come find something to eat here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-shenandoah,3.28,3.28,3.28,,3.2800000000000002
