I tried to tell him he wasn't missing much, but sometimes you have to figure it out for yourself.  We were greeted promptly and had a wonderful waitress. It was one aspect of the food that I have a bone to pick with (""surprise, surprise ... it's a chain restaurant,"" you must be saying). I ordered the bacon burger. Since this is a ""gourmet burger"" place and it stated ""applewood smoked bacon,"" I expected awesomeness. When it came out, I bit into it and was a bit shocked. Instead of having regular slices of bacon, they used the pre-cooked, microwaveable bacon that was soggy. I was disappointed. If other restaurants can use real bacon, why can't they? Also, what's up with the TVs? I guess they were going for a nostalgic vibe, as I have not seen tube televisions in restaurants in years. Even their bar area had them ... So I guess this isn't the place to hang out and watch a game? All-in-all, an ok experience.

You put that stuff on fries and you're in fried potato carb heaven!  When I go places like RR I'm not expecting some fine dining experience and when you're in suburbia where almost all of the employees are teenagers you grow to expect that most of them are more interested in what their fellow servers are doing then what customers are doing.

It was a good choice and arrived hot and in a very reasonable amount of time. My wife ordered the Teriyaki chicken sandwich, which she always loves.  We asked for french fries before the burgers arrived and our waitress brought them quickly with the sauces we requested. They were hot and fresh. The ones that arrived with the burgers were as well.  The colossus burger is something I liked seeing them add to the menu, even if only as a special. The brisket was smokey and flavorful. The onions were cooked until they were just transparent.

That came in handy because I tend to have a hard time deciding what I want or having a clue as to what different food options mean. He was also attentive to our table needs. Overall the customer service was enjoyable. My food was also excellent, I had the burger with the fried egg and bacon on it. That was darn tasty! There were four of us and three were happy with the quality of the food. One of us ordered the fish basket and he said that was a bad choice. So my advice would be to stick with burgers or salads, and also upgrade to the garlic herb fries they were delicious. The value we got from the quality of the food to the quality of the service was really hard to beat.

We stood at the hostess station for 10 minutes before we were even acknowledged. It's a Thursday at 3, I understand it's not the busiest time, but at least make an effort to see if you have customers waiting every couple minutes. After being seated a waiter takes our drink and appetizer order. A few minutes later our actual server comes by to take our entree order. I told him I wanted my egg over easy for my burger (this is my go to order, and I'm always asked by my other waiters so I just wanted to make sure it was done the way I wanted), to which he responded ""Well, if you read your menu it comes that way,"" in a very condescending tone. Not the biggest deal, but still. Our food comes out about 30 minutes later, and we still haven't received our appetizer (which were just fries that had cheese, bacon, and jalapenos and shouldn't take 40 minutes to come out). In fact, they could've used my fries from my entree for my appetizer. The only person who was apologetic about it was the guy who wasn't even our server. After take a bite of my food I wanted to wipe my hands off, but of course there are no napkins and after waiting for 5 minutes my boyfriend has to flag down another waiter to get them. Now that our entrees were almost gone and we were just now getting our appetizer, our drinks were empty and our waiter never came to refill them. I wanted a refill of my fries, and I had to flag the waiter down for that, without the chance to ask for a drink refill. After waiting another 15 minutes, I had to wave the server over to ask for a to go box for my fries and our check (we forgot that the tablets now replace the server).

1,Chris S.,"Portland, OR",227,421,2115.0,2.0,2017-08-19,"First, they don't publish accurate beer prices on the menu (one of my pet peeves), so buyer beware. The menu said ""select domestic 22 ounce drafts - $3.50"", so I figured a simple domestic IPA would either be $3.50 or a buck or two more (max) ... WRONG ... when the check arrived I was shocked to see that i had to pay $7.79 for a domestic draft beer. This is exactly why I hate restaurants that do not publish prices (drinks or otherwise) on their menu. Never again! Then, they burned my wife's Four Cheese Melt ($7.99). Gordon Ramsey would have had a shit fit, but he was not there unfortunately. By the time we got our server's attention, it was late (after 9pm) and we had no choice other than to have the kitchen prepare an unburnt one. Where the hell is their quality control? We think the server may have attempted to offer an ice cream sundae for our trouble, but it was not obviously clear, stating: ""can I bring you a sundae"", instead of ""we'd like to offer you an ice cream sundae on the house for your trouble"". In the end, there was a $1 ""Manager's Discount"" on our check, bringing the price of my overpriced beer down to $6.79, still way too much. From their special Red Tavern ($6.99) menu I ordered the Pig Out Tavern Double with smoked bacon, bacon-crumble aioli and American cheese, upgrading it to a ""gourmet"" (larger) beef patty for a $4 up-charge apparently ($10.99 total on check). I have had MANY burgers in the $5.99 to $8.99 range at other locals that were far superior to this. It came with a small portion of ""ENDLESS"" fries, which are only endless if your server happens to stop by from time to time which ours did not. Nuff said. A real bummer, we will not be going back any time soon. Overpriced, small, and mediocre in flavor, if not burnt, I was completely unimpressed. CombatCritic Gives This Red Robin 3 Out Of 10 Bombs ...

I wanted to do a petite salad which I never had an issue ordering but I was put on hold for a few minutes and was told I could be transferred to the store if I needed special assistance.

Our food was ice cold and my sweet potato fries were not fully cooked. The new plastic containers don't help either. All the steam from the hot food stays in the contains and makes the fries and food soggy. You guys are trying to rely too much on technology. Where is the real customer service these days?

7,Alan G.,"Tualatin, OR",3,26,1.0,1.0,2017-10-29,"This review unfortunately is based upon a meal experience that did not end up happening because of a silly corporate policy many chain restaurants carry. That policy is not taking reservations. We had a group of almost 20 parents and high soccer players coming after a nearby game. We called Red Robin 2-days before and asked for a reservation and they said just show up. That seemed like a big risk of not being able to get a group our size in if the restaurant was busy, especially on a weeknight. The hostess who received the call did say she would ""keep an eye out for us the night we were coming in to accommodate us as best they could"". Awhile we appreciated the comment it was still concerning on our part if we could get in.  As a backup we did get a reservation at a nearby Sherwood establishment. But we wanted Red Robin first for all the years of enjoying ourselves there.  So the night came and we brought our group down there to enjoy post game dinner and spirits. What occurred next is what we feared would happen absent of a reservation....70+ minute wait! Ugh! Red Robin ""keeping an eye out for us"" didn't exactly workout. So we took our patronage to nearby Schmizza Public House where they easily took us in on our backup reservation.
