27,Abe M.,"St Paul, MN",154,332,114.0,2.0,2012-01-18,"I went here with the family for the first time over the weekend and I am stumped as to why this place is always full. I wasn't feeling that need to pound down a burger, so I ordered some Game Day Nachos instead. I think that's where I went wrong. These had to be the worst nachos I've ever had. Fake cheese is never good on nachos. The chips were so salty, I could only eat about four before calling it quits. About the only thing half good on the nachos was the presentation. The atmosphere is very busy and loud with kids all around. It almost gives it a chaotic feel. But hey, at least they are kid friendly and the service was alright too.

I went with a group of 5 and the hostess told me the wait to be seated would be an hour. I knew that was a stretch so we decided to take the challenge. It ends up we made the right choice as we were seated in around 15 minutes! I will say that it was loud with fellow dinners but it wasn't a problem for our group. We ordered a wide variety of mainly burger dishes and everyone liked the meals they ordered. the 5 of us eat for around $60.00 so for great burgers and lots of beers, sodas and shakes for $60.00 I'd say a great value.

The only good thing about Red Robin is there refillable steak fries. They were the only part of my meal that was hot. They also told me this ""The smaller patties will tend to get colder faster."".I wish that she would have told me that sooner. The Manager tries to get me to order something else.

55,Kate M.,"Minneapolis, MN",64,162,10.0,3.0,2013-01-09,"Yesterday I felt the call of the potato. I love fries, but I have a particular soft spot for steak fries doused in salt. Red Robin has giant flippers of fries and yep, they're salty and hot.  I tend to order the fancy burgers with the garden burger or chicken since I'm not a total masochist with the bottomless fries and my cholesterol. I used to get the Banzai burger every time, but got tired of the cheese, mayo and sauce turning the burger into a mushy handful. Esp with the garden burger which just seemed to dissolve into  food fight fodder. I tried the bruschetta chicken sandwich last time and was pretty impressed. I hate tomatoes (shhh) but I love balsamic so found the glaze and ciabatta roll saved the sandwich. Last night I tried the A1 Peppercorn with the garden burger. There was a little snafu with the kitchen not getting the *keep* the bacon message, but our server quickly brought out the missing slices. It was very peppercorny (yes I know. the hint was in the name and a little saltier than I like). We went for an early dinner so the place was quieter than usual and our server pretty attentive.

58,Seppuk U.,"Eagan, MN",3,89,,2.0,2013-01-14,"I don't get it.  I don't get why so many people are raving about this place on here?  Shills?  I stopped in the other night for the first time and in a nutshell here was my experience: A.  Ordered their self proclaimed signature cheeseburger.  It was average.  I've had better burgers at a multitude of joints around the TC.  Most of those joints aren't even concentrating on burgers like this place professes.   And the kicker, the burger was EXPENSIVE.  For a mediocre burger I will not pay these prices. B.  Where was the great service so many rave about?  The menu said I got free refills on my steak fries.   The waitress did not return to my table (it was 8 pm, not busy) until I was finished eating.  That means my water didn't get refilled, nor my fries.  This is great service.  Oh, when she dropped off the food she literally returned 15 seconds later to ask how the food was.  I hadn't even tried it yet.  ""looks good"" ?? That was the last I saw of her for the next 20 minutes.  Correction, I did see her having a great chat with the apparently dreamy bartender while she neglected me, her customer, the one paying the tip.  C.  The Steak Fries.  Whats the big deal?  Could it be the four tons of salt mix they put on them?  Cuz other than that they ain't all that.  Add the salt and BOOM! you have fries you could eat that night or maybe even 6 months from now, because they've been PRESERVED!  As you can tell I was not impressed with this joint.  If I'm paying I doubt I'll be back. Overpriced mediocrity.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-shoreview?start=40,3.24,3.24,3.24,2.408,3.2400000000000007
46,Dawn S.,"St Paul, MN",0,94,,5.0,2013-03-18,"I give Red Robin 5 stars because of the vegetarian burger option. They have boca and gardenburger.  The boca burger has a smoke flavor and a nice texture, a good vessel for the ""burger"" toppings. I have never understood why all restaurants that serve burgers do not always offer a boca burger in place of beef.  You just keep them in the freezer until someone orders.  I HATE black bean burgers because of the seasonings; if I want cumin and taco flavors, I'll go to a Mexican restaurant and order tacos...   So, in my opinion, other burger joints should lose the black bean burger and just stock the boca burgers. For us, the service has always been average to above average.  Nothing to complain about. I do like their sides options.  If you don't want their bottom-less steak fries (and who wouldn't), they do have a side salad, steamed broccoli, sweet potato fries, and a bunch of others as options.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-shoreview?start=40,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.7399999999999998,3.2800000000000002
49,Kim R.,"Saint Paul, MN",91,359,298.0,3.0,2013-04-02,"I'm not huge on chain restaurants, so I had never tried Red Robin before this past weekend when some friends suggested meeting for lunch.  This place is pretty big, and the service was great. The menu is very extensive so everyone should be able to find something that suits their fancy. I'm not a red-meat eater, so I steered clear of all of the burger options. After reading a review on Yelp, I decided to try the Whiskey River Chicken wrap with a cup of chicken tortilla soup. The wrap had really nice flavor from the BBQ sauce and ranch, but the chicken was not very hot... The soup I would definitely not order again. It tasted like it was from a can and the flavor was overpowered by too much cumin. We started our meal with the pretzel bites. I was super pumped to try these, because who doesn't like a pretzel with cheese sauce?? Unfortunately, the cheese sauce was not great, it was a little thick and goupy. I  preferred the whole-grain mustard sauce. There was something different about the pretzels themselves, they almost tasted deep fried... I prefer a traditional pretzel, I don't need the extra fat and grease.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-shoreview?start=40,3.28,3.28,3.28,2.508,3.2800000000000002

48,Rick M.,"Shoreview, MN",8,60,,2.0,2013-08-14,"I'm not sure what I miss that others really appreciate about this place.  The dining room is pretty uninspiring, the wait-staff seem friendly enough but also seem like they're in training and the food is average at best, slightly below average more often than not. The bar's okay but nothing to write home about. And the prices seem high given the dining experience and the quality of the food. My three favorite places for hamburgers are Blue Door, Groveland Tap and the Nook/Shamrock. Food quality is far better, IMO. Ambience is quirkier, reflecting the independent ownership vs corporate-dictated decorating. Prices actually seem slightly lower. The wait-staff are always great and know what they're doing and what's working (or not) in the kitchen or at the tap. Yeah, it takes me 10-15 minutes longer to drive there and parking at those places isn't as convenient.

42,Annette L.,"St Paul, MN",8,24,,2.0,2013-11-18,"""Miles"" to go... While I enjoy the food here, I have to say our service this time was terrible. Miles strolled up to the table and called my fiance ""boss"" - immediate no-no. It took forever for our drinks to arrive, and my mom's sandwich didn't arrive with the correct bread because Miles neglected to tell her that they were out. Are all of these things understandable? Sure. But you see, a GOOD server will stop by your table and let you know some of these things -- ""Hey, I'm really sorry, it looks like the bar is short-staffed. Might take a little longer to get your drinks.""  Or, ""Just to let you know, we're out of the ciabatta. Is a regular bun okay, or did you want to look at ordering something else?"" He never actually stopped at our table after the food was delivered. He just breezed by and asked if everything was okay, never actually waiting for an answer before he moved on. Very unprofessional. As a person that formerly worked in the restaurant business, I thought to myself, 'Shouldn't that kind of hospitality be commonplace for a server?' Yet Miles didn't do any of these things. Hence why he ended up with a collective tip from the 3 of us, of less than 5%. Get Miles out of there, and hire quality staff please, that know how to wait tables. And if you, the reader, have the misfortune of being seated in his section, ask for a new server right away.

53,Dan P.,"Minneapolis, MN",1,58,,2.0,2013-12-20,"Hey, the bottomless steak fries are great-ask them to leave off the 'Red Robin' spice.  The server was effective in a hurried, friendly but impersonal style.  The place was very busy for early on a Thursday night.  The menu is bewildering with plenty of add ons available.  Toll:  $50 for three burger meals, one beverage (a beer) and one appetizer.  Yikes.   But what about the burgers? It's a burger place, I have to talk about the 'gourmet' burgers right?   Ok, here's my take on the burgers.  Less beef than I remember, less beef/burger flavor, more food service bun, more cheese, food service bacon-the salty transparent kind you can almost see through. My old favorite the royal red robin burger (topped with a fried egg) has declined.   The burger competition around town is tough.  Red Robin burgers are going in the wrong direction and value is questionable.  Better consider a name change to Gourmet Steak Fries....and burgers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-shoreview?start=40,3.04,3.04,3.04,2.568,3.0400000000000005

21,Scott E.,"Colorado Springs, CO",26,339,46.0,3.0,2015-04-02,"After singing the jingle for years...Yummmm!, it was time to experience Red Robin. We wondered in around 7PM on a Thursday. The place was moderately full. It is a cross between an Applebees and Upscale hotel bar. Instantly greeted by a college boy. He sat us in the bar in front of the big screens airing hockey. He said that he would be there to help us if we needed it, but that Nessa would be our server. I will divided this review into four categories: 1 - Look and feel.  Four stars for clean, modern and inviting. 2 - Service was one star. While Nessa was great, she was overworked or overwhelmed by the number of tables she had to serve. Her smile was real, her insight for first timers was spot on and her attention after the food arrived and swiftly getting our check was excellent. Once we were seated it was 14 minutes before water was brought to the table. With the wings, there were no napkins or utensils. I asked the host and he brought over some napkins and forks, and said they were ""out of knives"". This was a new reply for me. Apparently Red Robin needs to cut back a bit on advertising and invest in some cutlery. The food did arrive quickly and hot.  3 - Food was four-five stars. Excellent. Impressive. While the wings are small (where do they find chickens that tiny?), they were perfectly cooked. We had bone-in plain batter with their BBQ and spin on buffalo sauce. So yummy. The homemade potato chips that are served with the wings are delicious. We will be back just for this appetizer. We shared the Royal Red Robbin Burger with endless steak fries. This burger had the over easy egg on it. Very good. The fries were awesome. Congrats to the kitchen staff for delivering great food.  4 - Other stuff: Beer list is ok, but no Grain Belt Premium on tap or bottles.  Parking is in a large stand alone lot. Bathrooms are clean. Large full service bar.  Overall a three, but if service improves, an easy four star experience.  We will be back when we have LOTS OF TIME to wait and we will be sure to be properly hydrated before entering.

Our boys can't get enough of their bottomless root beer floats. We love the Burnin' Love Burger. Try the Ghost pepper sauce on the side if you like things heated up a notch. They give out free balloons to the kids and sing a song for you if its your birthday. If you are into a full bar and beer on tap; they have that too. Overall it's a great place for a burger.

The waiter had switched them up by mistake which I can see happening easily.  -The waiter then got our orders and had brought out the food and had brought out the wrong one for my friend. He corrected it and said he was sorry.  -We hardly got asked how the meal was or if we needed anything else. We got our refills when needed but other then that nothing.  -We paid our bills and on the way out our waiter didn't bat an eye towards us or even said have a good day or thanks for coming.

Try this: Open your burger bun, take some of the house seasoned salt on the table and generously shake it on. Now try your burger. It makes a world of difference.

My mom's pickled pear lemonade took longer but a plain vanilla shake for my five year old took over 20 minutes to get. The appetizer and the meals themselves took long enough to come out as well probably due to how busy it was at the restaurant. I was concerned since people who had arrived after us got drinks and appetizers before us. They messed us the burger my mom ordered and offered to fix it and not charge us for it. The Red Robin rewards are nice to since every so often we'll get a free burger which we did last night. The burgers are decent, gourmet...no.
