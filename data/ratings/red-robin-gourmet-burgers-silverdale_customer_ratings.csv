She was moving the whole time.  RR staff work together as a team to make sure everyone got their food while it was still hot and when the table of 12 had 4 things they still wanted.  The wait person moved swiftly to accomplish their guests desires.  It was amazing and awesome to watch.  RR staff  made sure that each table whether with one person or the twelve had everything they needed and enjoyed their meal.

Tin ceilings throughout...Really? Ceilings are supposed to absorb sound, not reflect it.  The three intoxicated teen-adults at the bar were heard by all.  The only saving grace was that they occasionally drowneded out the two screaming babies we had to listen to...while in the bar. - I only ordered two items, hot wings (clucks or something) and a salad, both with ranch dressing.  The wings used to be better; these were just winglets...no drumsticks, and the red sauce was oily and nasty.  The salad, when I eventually received it (yes, I had to ask for it after the hot wings had arrived), had wilted lettuce and the dressing was blue cheese. - The draft beer was only moderately cold, not 32 degrees like some places these days. Overall, this may be the last time I go to Red Robin...at least, this Red Robin.  I would consider going back, but only after they changed their food, upgraded their taps, hired a better staff, and totally demolished the building and rebuilt it so the bar doesn't sound like a freaking daycare center.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-silverdale?start=100,2.8,2.8,2.8,2.18,2.8

The meat on the burgers was NOT good, I think the changed their supplier...maybe? The ""fried"" egg on my burger was NOT fried.

I had an inclining that things wouldn't go well when we sat in the bar and no-one said so much as hi to us for 15 minutes.  We should have left then.  The service was abysmal, and the food was mediocre.  We were ""served"" (if that's what you dare call it) by Charles, who took a long time to greet us, a long time to take our order, never brought silverware or napkins, and didn't bring our food (which came cold and soggy) for 50 minutes.  I guess he probably had some alcohol he was serving elsewhere with expectations of higher tips.   My husband ordered a chicken wrap with a cup of chili.  The wrap had no visible chicken, and was quite small and overwhelmed with mediocre bbq sauce.  He says they must've been scraping the bottom of the chili can to come up with the three tablespoons of bad chili that came in his cup. I ordered a mushroom burger.  It came cold and soggy, and when I looked inside I found canned mushrooms.  I asked the guy who brought the food (not Charles) if they used canned mushrooms, and he adamantly denied having any canned food at the restaurant, but immediately brought out a cup (fuller than my husband's chili) of cooked mushrooms that were fresh, not canned.  The burger was tasteless, grey, and cold, the bun was mushy from sitting in (I have to assume) canned mushroom goo on the plate for who knows how long, the Swiss cheese was either non-existent or flavorless.  I made the mistake of paying for bacon, which was also pretty flavorless. We were stunned by too much Christmas shopping and made the mistake of eating the meal and paying for it.  Twenty minutes later the heartburn started. No more Red Robin for us!  We live in a place where we joke about the mediocre service and food, but Red Robin of Silverdale has the worst restaurant where we live beat for mediocrity.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-silverdale?start=120,2.72,2.72,2.72,1.956,2.72

143,Katy G.,"Silverdale, WA",1,13,,3.0,2014-05-02,"Today, our server was Katie.  My husband and I come to Red Robin quite often. We enjoy their freckled lemonade, and milkshakes. My husband likes their root beer floats, too. Today I got the Bacon burger with Cheddar, no mayo or tomato, add pickles instead. When I got my burger is was nice and hot, had a good amount of lettuce, the cheese looked nice and melted and there were plenty of pickles which really makes me happy! The fries were a little cold, but we were too hungry to even care. We ordered some of their Mozzarella sticks and got them within 15 minutes. They were alright, I've definitely had better. They were also a little cold. My husband got the A.1 Peppercorn and he really likes it. He said it was juicy and filling. My burger was a little tasteless, even adding the red robin seasoning didn't do much. But, again I was too hungry to really care, or even notice. Our waitress came to check on us about 2 or 3 times, just brought extra napkins (my husband is a messy eater). She just brought us drinks when she seen we were getting low. I really enjoyed our time here. The food could've been more hot, and better tasting... But hey I don't expect much from a chain restaurant. Our last experience was awful though! (different waitress) They lost our order and we were there for 2 hours. They kept bringing us fries to keep us from starving to death, but never gave us any discounts for the trouble or anything free. Our meals had fries already so I'm kind of wishing they would've offered something else with our meals (we ate our weight in fries, lol)  Today's experience was a different story though, we had a good time. No long waits, the waitress was fast, friendly, and helpful. She got a well deserved tip. My advice to Red Robin, is to stop spending so much money creating a new menu every few months and spend your money making your tasteless food have it's great taste back. Your food has changed since we first starting going here (years ago).

The table was greasy and sticky and pretty much ruined it for me.  They finally wiped it off right before we got our food.

109,Eric R.,"Bremerton, WA",13,5,2.0,2.0,2014-09-01,"Ok, so you can usually tell when you get the waiter or waitress that is new because of their inability to let you ask for something before they zip out of existence - or spill a drink - or make an excuse about how long the bottomless fries will take - and all of this in perhaps the first 10 minutes after being seated. What I dont get is why you wait for a table for 10-15 minutes, and then you sit down, only to have to wait another 10 minutes for horrible service. The thing is, I realize it's NOT fast food - so when I'm paying an average of 12 dollars for a burger and 3-5 dollars a drink, I do expect good service, and that's just the things on the menu. Am I right? So it's been 23 minutes an we've gotten fries, only to have devoured the measly baby portion in 2 min. Serious, how can they boast bottom less, when they come out of the gate saying ""it's a dinner crowd and excuse excuse excuse!"" I'm like, ok...hire a new cook team and bring in reserves, you should know by now, people like your food, and I as many am sacrificing service and wait time for that delicious campfire sauuuuce smothered on just about anything. Ok, ten minutes later and a second drink refill is finally here, but a server zipped away before I could ask for sugar. 101 for tips, always ask- ""is there anything else I can get you?"" ....I at this point am feeling bad and ask for more sugar. Duh, the table has none and you're bringing me tea. I robbed the table behind me (exhausted from getting up), and now the kids who ordered the 5 dollar root beer floats are being told the ice cream machine is ""running slow"". So- the food comes, still no shake for the wife- 30 min later and still no refills for kids. Sad. I don't know if I feel more sorry my family who are patiently full of sad face and disappointment or my fellow red robin employees who simply don't care. I even took a picture of my sons colossus burger...the sadness in his eyes cries why me father? What did I do to deserve this? For the love of god! And even the bun was wrong (they ran out of white). Wait! All drinks have arrived, my wife has almost finished her meal. The sadness in her eyes is compounded by unexplainable tears. The great red robin would be clucking in his grave knowing the disservice bestowed upon us. What they lack in service they make up for in food quality....but you'll wait. And you may have to ask 4 times for your shake, from several employees. Note to Red Robin, forget the birthday clapping and work on customers. Hint, the birthday people don't tip. At this point the salt and sugar has kicked in and almost all is forgotten on a weak attempt at service, now we wait for the check. A whopping $60 later, and I feel like I could have gotten the same thing from Micky Dees for 1/4 the price and 1/4 the time.

Like felt bad for our server, as he looked pretty overwhelmed.  It took probably another half hour for our food, and by that time, we were starving.  When it finally arrived, our server couldn't even properly serve us. The tables were so close together, our tiny server couldn't get through to set plates. It was literally ""take one and pass it down."" Pretty sure I wasn't getting paid to serve food. Along with you burger, you get a half dozen fries, because they're ""bottomless.""  That is, if your overworked server actually has time to bring more. If he does, let's hope you're close to the people at your table, because you'll be sharing their ""bottomless"" fries.

The line was into the parking lot for the free burger and ""bottomless"" steak fries. We sat in the bar area because we would have had to make a reservation in the lobby. No problem. We found a booth. They had just opened. Couldn't really tell who our server was. There were about six, standing near the flatware station arguing which person had which tables. As it turned out we were delivered a menu from one server, our order was taken by another, our food was delivered by another, and we had to ask another to take the order for more fries. Our burgers came pretty fast. Problem was there were only 8 fries on my plate, and 12 on my wife's. Ya, we counted them. Couldn't believe they were so tight with the fries. C'mon Red Robin. This is what you do. Put more fries on the plate. Burgers were good. My wife had the Banzai and I had the Tavern Double.  Hers had a little too much grease on the bottom bun, but otherwise she enjoyed it. We were done with the burgers and first fries about 10 minutes before a server popped up close enough to us to take an order for more fries. We weren't allowed to order them up front, or we would have. So, Red Robin, we like your burgers. Fix the fry situation. Fix the server situation.

My family and friends have celebrated countless birthdays at different Red Robin restaurants...

They seem to have a good team these days in Silverdale. My favorite server, hands down, is named Cody. We try to sit in his section whenever possible, and he seems to work a lot since we have been at many different times of day and he's nearly always there. Cody is friendly, extremely knowledgeable about the menu and options available, and attentive to no end. The matter how busy he is, he takes time to stop at your table and let you know what's going on with your order. I would say the one thing that they still need to work on is the hosting staff... They're not very warm and they often appear frustrated or frazzled. The last several times I've been there, you see them off to the side talking in hushed voices...

45,Kyle R.,"Kingston, WA",194,30,9.0,1.0,2015-06-13,Alright this is just ridiculous. My wife and I come in  all the time and order 1 burger to share and a root beer float to share. This time however our waitress informed us they were no longer allowed to cut our burger in half. Which is a little ridiculous I have literally never been to a place much less red Robin that would not cut my burger in half. It's basically standard at red Robin so I have no idea why it changed. But no my wife and I have to try and cut it our selves which you know isn't that hard but we for sure lose the aesthetics of the burger when we cut it our self.  OK so that was strike 1 Strike 2 was when we asked for a refill on our root beer float. And the waitress asked if we were sharing. When we said yes she refused to refill it. So let me get this straight if I am by myself I can order 10 if I wanted to and it would be fine and be the price of 1.  but if I want 2 to share between my wife and I cant. That is a really stupid policy and a policy I have never heard about until today and I have been coming here for YEARS.  Strike 3 is right after that she asked if we wanted more fries. So we can share bottomless fries but not a bottomless drink. ugh This visit just pissed me off,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-silverdale?start=40,2.84,2.84,2.84,1.5400000000000003,2.84

The food is pretty standard.  If you've been to Red Robin you know what to expect from the food.  If you haven't been to Red Robin, don't make this one your first experience. The service here is LOUSY, and as far as I can tell has been for years (we used to come to this location when we lived here before 5 years ago and nothing seems to have changed).   We've been in three times since we moved back (in the last few months) and the service is always slow (we know this and we NEVER come here when we are in any kind of hurry).  The last time we were in was the worst though.  First, we were not acknowledged at all when we came in, I had to walk up to the two girls ""hosting"" and wait while they finished their (not work related) conversation before they acknowledged I was there and took my name for the wait list (wait for a table was not too long).  They have changed the kids menus (they are now much like the regular menus and are not coloring pages, so there is nothing to entertain kids while you wait   for your food), our server did rustle up some old menu/coloring pages for our kids, but I don't know how long that will last.  Knowing this place is slow we always try to be ready to order the first time we see our server, so we placed our food order with our drink order.  Our drinks came relatively promptly (but were never refilled and two of us were just drinking water).  Our food took a long time (over 30 minutes), and when it came it was cold.  My chicken wrap was completely cold (the chicken should at least be warm) and it was dry (almost no BBQ sauce and almost no cheese) and my fries were cold.  My children's food was cold, COLD.  My husband's burger was cold AND overcooked and his fries were cold as well.  Also, they have changed the garlic parm fries which used to have real pieces of garlic, real shredded parm, and real parsley, they now have  some flavoring that comes out of a can, no real garlic flavor/pieces, no shredded parm, and no parsley, certainly NOT worth the extra $1 you pay for them (so, just don't).  Twice I made eye contact with the manager as he walked by but neither time did he ask how we were doing.  The server didn't even really stop to see how things were...it just feels like no one there cares if you have a good experience or if you ever return. We really like Red Robin's food (when it is cooked right and served hot) but this location is just bad, which is too bad because there aren't a ton of predictable food places in the area.   There are some non-chain options in the area, not as predictable with their food, but the service always seems better.  Like they care if they have and keep your business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-silverdale?start=60,2.88,2.88,2.88,1.6400000000000001,2.88

I can honestly say this was the worst dining out experience I've ever had!!  First we waited 35 minutes to be seated (expected to wait, no biggie) than once we were seated we waited over an hour for our food. When our food came out my daughters didn't, and only half of her friends did (9 & 10 year old hungry kids) I ordered chicken on a stick for my 10 month old and his chicken was raw, still pink in the middle!! All 3 the burgers us adults (one pregnant) had ordered were also on the raw side, we complained and explained how we had ordered them (2 ""little"" pink 1 no pink) we than waited 20 minutes for our order to be corrected... when it came back all were ""super well done"" like burnt hockey pucks!! So we have not waited 2 hours for nasty food that was uneatable... We honestly should have just walked out with out paying, but didn't. We paid and left starving!! I will never return. Who serves raw food to an infant and a pregnant woman? Here's a tip... Cook your food properly the first time, and you won't get behind having to fix orders. Also the bathrooms were NASTY!! only one stall had toilet paper, no paper towels, and a few stalls didn't lock. When we told the hostess she just rolled her eyes at me and said ""yeah! I know"" Well excuse me for letting you know.. I know there was a 20 minute gap from when my daughter and her friend went in and informed us, than I went in and found it in the same condition... if she knew than someone should have done something about it.

Be careful you don't let them play too long with the new table ziosks or you will be paying an additional 1.99$ with your meal.  This is one of my favorite places as you can get a pretty delicious vegan boca patty substituted on any burger. I also am a big fan of anything bottomless. I appreciate the move to healthier side options like broccoli and salad, but often still go for the fries. My non veg friends have many choices for food items as well. They seem to have really improved on the menu and now offer quite a bit more than just the burgers and fries they are known for. I also really love that they use a nutrition calculator on their website which gives you the freedom to play with different items on your burger if you have particular dietary requirements you are trying to meet.

This resturant is on its way out in my opionion. Sad I remember when the managers used to come to your table to make sure everything was good. I never see a manager anymore.

32,Jennifer O.,"Renton, WA",45,12,5.0,1.0,2016-01-02,"Went here for lunch today thinking it was going to be like any other usual Saturday busy experience at Red Robin.  Boy, were we wrong. Waited the usual 15 minutes to be seated which was no big deal.  Place was insanely busy which was no big deal.  Lisa, our server, checked in with us quickly to get our drink order which was fine.  Noticed the kids menu no longer offers coloring pages or crayons to keep kids occupied, which is the first negative.  But that was just the start. Ordered a rather simple food for lunch.  Butter and cheese pasta for my daughter, a cup of the French Onion soup, the Turkey BLTA sandwich with fries and the Whiskey River BBQ Burger.  Not rocket science here. 45 minutes later.....soup arrives in a square bowl the size of maybe 2"" x 2"" and maybe 2"" deep with soup that was ICE COLD AND ROCK HARD.  But here's the kicker....no other food?!  Sit waiting and waiting and waiting another 15 minutes.  Ask about our food and was told very rudely by Lisa that it would be out when it was ready and the food runners would know when it was ready.  Ummmm ok? When our food comes out 20 minutes later, fries are ice cold, and kids pasta is CRUNCHY AND ICE COLD.  I mean seriously, how hard is it to boil pasta and throw some butter and cheese on this? When we called Rick, the manager, over, he was quick to point out he knew what the issues were and seemed to know this was an ongoing issue.  Ok, so if you know these are ongoing issues, why not fix them????  The table right across from is was rather ticked off too which was pretty funny too. It will definitely be a cold day in you know what before we return to this place.  Hopefully other people will have better experiences than we did.  What a shame how downhill this restaurant has gone......",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-silverdale?start=20,1.84,2.41,2.41,2.18,2.1820000000000004

We had a toddler in our party, and this is why Red Robin was chosen, due to it usually being pretty kid friendly. It took 20 minutes to get drinks and when we ordered the server advised us that they were out of broccoli. Um, how does a restaurant run out of broccoli that it offers as a ""bottomless"" option on their menu? It then took 35 minutes to get our food. Our server came by once and when I asked for a refill, I never received any one. We never saw the server again. This wound up being a 2 hour experience, which is a long time for a 3 year old.

48,Cho D.,"Silverdale, WA",6,148,80.0,1.0,2016-02-20,"I couldn't like a location less. This has got to be the WORST Red Robin ever. We've (my husband and I) have gone three times. The first time we went we waited and waited. It was mid day on a Wednesday. Less then half of the tables were full. It took over 40 minutes to get a burger. Endless fries my a$$ the ones they brought were cold and grease laden. We ordered a second batch, and they came to the table after we paid. We got refills once on drinks. I just had water. Never got the extra napkins, or the ranch sauce we asked for. The waitress stopped by once. The other times we flagged down someone else, it was the waiter for the tables nearby. The bathroom smelled like putrid garbage. It was very dirty. Second visit. Busy as all get out. We waited, my husband wanted burgers. They sat us at a table. We were literally on top of the next table. They couldn't get out unless we moved.  We ordered a small app. The chips with ranch. We placed our order about 5 minutes later for our food. We got our drinks after about 20 minutes. After sitting there for 50 minutes we got our food, about 3 minutes later we got the ranch and chips. ARE YOU EFFING kidding me? No apology, no nothing she sat them down so fast the ranch spilled over, and she just turned around and went to talk to another table. My husband got the BBQ burger with a pineapple slice. There was so much BBQ on the burger he had to remove it with a spoon. We saw the waitress once after that. I was just a bad time. We had the wedges that night I believe, and they were the highlight. Okay so the final time. We had a 15 minutes wait. Maybe 20-30 people there. My guess is they didn't have enough staff. They sat us alone against that wall when you walk in. My husband ordered a burger again. I tried something new. I got the French dip. My husband ordered a long island. He was so grossed out by it. It tasted exactly like watered down lemonade and cheap gin. We ordered the chips with ranch again, because it's just the right size. This time we got it before our food, but it still took 20 minutes. Also they gave us about 10 chips. So we didn't even eat it. At this point I'm getting into a argument with my husband. The issue, ""Why do we keep coming back here? They ignore us, the food sucks, and the wait for everything is ridiculous."" When we finally get our food. His burger was char, and his fries were cold. I got sweet potatoes fries. They were old and tasted like they were dropped into grease for a second time. I could have rung them out. The au jus for my beef was Disgusting. It tasted like beef drippings mixed with a box of salt. The sandwich was exceptionally small. To be fare I'm from Chicago, a beef is three times as big, smothered in peppers and cheese, and dripping with au jus that taste like heaven. On a fresh French bread, with a golden crispy crust. This was gross. Again the service was so bad. Also there is a young woman (African American) or so I think. She is a hostess. Three of the waitresses had a nasty conversation about her. That my husband and I heard every word of. Save yourself the trouble. We tried out the Brewery across the parking lot. Same prices for burgers, small options but better meat, burger, taste, quality. Someone told me they were pricy. However we spend 15 on a burger at Red Robin, and the same at the Brewery, and they also have great service and bottomless fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-silverdale?start=40,2.0,2.39,2.39,2.372,2.2340000000000004
28,Cody H.,"Bremerton, WA",0,2,,1.0,2016-02-24,"I never write reviews on restaurants, I dont know if you can see it anywhere but this is my first yelp review. Yep, my experience was bad enough that I signed up for yelp so I could hopefully save others from spending money on overpriced, thrown together food.  Took my wife and 2 kids since we knew they had remodeled we figured maybe the actual restaurant part had improved as well. We were seated quickly and thats where things went south. We waited about 10 minutes to see our server, at which time we ordered 4 waters and our food. We got a ranch/chips app, 3 burgers, and a kids pizza with a fruit cup side. 10 minutes later we got the chips, and my water was empty (keep this in mind). The chips themselves were fine, as was the dip, but there were about 3 other types of fried food bits with the chips as well as splattered oil all over the bottom of the plate. As a former fry cook in my highschool days, what this translates to is the fry cook went straight from basket to plate. After 10 minutes of eating our appetizer and an additional 10 minutes of waiting, we received our food, not from our server, but from another person. My crab cake burger consisted of the following: a crabcake, 4 spinach leaves, a squirt of sauce, and 3 sun dried tomatos stacked on top of each other (yes I counted because I couldnt believe I paid 15$ for this). The side of fries was 8 steak fries and more random fried food bits, again, yes I counted.  My wife's burger, which she ordered medium, was burnt and overcooked and the bottom bun was incredibly soggy from the bottom up, as though the plate was wet. She received about the same amount of fries I did. On the note of her fries, she paid an extra 1$ for the garlic fries, this consisted of about 1/4 teaspoon of parmesan cheese and non-existant garlic seasoning.  My daughter had the kid's pizza with a side of fruit salad, which came in a 2 oz plastic dipping cup ( this was a joke right? Like, haha we're kidding, here is some more!). She finished the fruit cup in 2 bites, the pizza she enjoyed.  My son's burger was the only thing that came out ok, he had a side salad with it and it was as expected. The person that brought our food was gone too quickly for me to request my water be refilled. Our server came to our table shortly after the food arrived and we ordered another order of fries for my wife and I, and another fruit side for my daughter. I also requested more water since mine had been empty over 25 minutes at this point.  We begin eating, and while the food didnt taste bad, I couldn't help but feel as though I was paying way too much money for what we were receiving, I mean the 2 burgers we (my wife and I) ordered were supposed to be Red Robins gourmet burgers, we paid 15$ each for these and I have received better looking burgers from Burger King.  About 15 minutes later, after we were nearly done, another person (who wasn't our server) delivered the fries. Once again they had other bits of fried food in them, mine had a couple of tortilla strips and a fried jalapeno slice and my wife's had a couple of jalapeno slices, what looked to be a fried mushroom and some bits of onion ring batter. They had forgotten my daughter's fruit cup, which since we had only seen our server twice at this point, we had to flag down another server to ask for. That came about 5 minutes later in an actual square ramekin, as it probably should have come in to begin with. At this point we just finished what we had on our plates, and since we had no hope of seeing our server in the near future, walked over to the server station to get a to go box for the fries. We used the little tablet thing, paid our bill and left. Remeber earlier when I said to keep in mind when my water was empty? It was still empty. This little visit, with terrible, non existent, service and thrown together food (seriously, the burger king near my house puts together burgers better and with more effort) cost me 60$. I will not be returning to Red Robin, nor will I recommend my friends or family to this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-silverdale?start=20,1.96,2.38,2.38,2.436,2.2119999999999997
77,Rebecca H.,"Butte-Silver Bow, MT",0,1,,1.0,2016-03-08,"My granddaughter & I had lunch at this Red Robin today.  It took awhile for our order to be taken because our server was really busy.  Our food arrived and our burgers were really good.  My sweet potato fries were cold.  Our waitress checked on us and brought me some new hot fries.  So, I took the time to give her a good review on the video checkout.     While I was doing this, my 19 yr. old granddaughter went outside to have a cigarette while I paid the bill.  She calls me from the parking lot and tells me the cops pulled up and were accusing her of trying to steal a car or stuff out of a car.  You've got to be kidding was my reaction!!  I drive a non descript dark gray Kia Optima....there was the same style dark gray car parked one car away from mine with a white car in between.  She accidently went and stood next to the other dark gray car and smoked her cigarette. Then she went back into the restaurant to use the restroom while she was still waiting for me.  She went back out and realized she had been standing by the wrong dark gray car and found my dark gray KIA and stood next to it while she waited for me.  The man that owned the gray car one space away from mine, was watching all this from the restaurant and he got everyone convinced that my granddaughter was trying to steal cars or items from cars and then the Sheriff was called.  She had just had lunch at Red Robin with her grandmother!!      After the call from my granddaughter, I walked out to see two patrol cars and a Deputy standing with my granddaughter.  After hearing the accusations, I told the officer that the other gray car looked almost identical to mine and anyone could have made that mistake.  The 2nd officer came out of the restaurant and was very set on the fact that she was trying to steal something based on the overreaction of a customer(s).  That is the farthest thing from the truth!!!  She was merely waiting for me to finish my lunch and pay the bill. The older of two Deputies told my granddaughter that the manager has now band her from the Silverdale Red Robin and she will be arrested for trespassing if she ever returns.  I find this an extreme reaction to a simple misunderstanding.  Myself or my granddaughter never had a chance to speak with the manager before this decision was made.  My granddaughter is not a thief.  She is an excellent student with a clean record.  The Manager definitely should have handled this situation differently.  All he/she had to do was to ask my granddaughter if she was waiting for someone in the restaurant??? and all this could have been avoided....she was not loitering...she had just had lunch at Red Robin with her grandmother and was just waiting for me and having a cigarette. She is a typical 19 year old young lady and she was probably checking out her hair and makeup in the car window reflections, not casing the car(s).  Total misunderstanding fueled by a paranoid customer and handled poorly by management.  My granddaughter was humiliated and left with me, 'in tears' .....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-silverdale?start=60,1.92,2.35,2.35,2.5320000000000005,2.1780000000000004

We recently moved back to this area and silverdale Red Robin is the only one in this area. After the last awful experience I said I wouldn't eat there again. Today is my birthday so my husband took me to lunch. He knows Red robin is normally a favorite and convinced me to give it another try. Maybe last time was a fluke. Wrong! We ordered appetizers, our meals and asked for a basket of fries (my meal came with fries), and the server said he was going to have to charge us extra for the fries. I've never ever had that happen when I already ordered a meal with fries. We went ahead and paid extra for more fries. We also asked for lots of ranch. He brought out one little container of watery ranch and the sorriest basket of fries I've ever seen. My husbands meal was brought out incorrect. The service and food were just blah.

She was very attentive without being overbearing, extremely knowledgeable about the menu and had my kids rolling with laughter through our whole meal.  This is the type of experience I hope for when I go spend my hard earned money and makes me want to come back again sooner than later.

24,Larry L.,"Miami Beach, FL",2,61,,2.0,2017-02-04,"Overrated and Overpriced. Service is always lackluster. $15 for a burger in Kitsap County is just to expensive. Basic burgers covered in enough goop to disguise the very average burger. Red Robin is creative in having a great business model to turn a cheap burger patty into something desirable by putting enough sauces pineapple and additional crap to distract you from the fact you just paid way too much in Kitsap County for a burger with an egg on it. We tried going here after several years of avoiding the restaurant mainly due to poor service in the past. Service was mediocre at best, once your burger is dropped off they are done with you until they try to up sell the deserts. Same rating as Denny's hmmmm what does that tell you?

It made it not messy at all.  I had the freckled salad. That's a fruit salad with their freckled lemonade poured over it. It was a bit sweet but I liked it overall. Everybody knows Red Robin.
