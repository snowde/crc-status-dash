When you eat there, the food is always fresh and looks really yummy which is very important to me. BUT!!!! whenever i would do a take out (which is usually a pound of french fries, ranch and campfire sause), the food is old, the fries is not crunchy on the outside and soft on the outside. It's completely dry. I have a feeling they take old, cold fries, throw it on the pan, warm it up in the oven to give it some color for like 5 min and box it... not cool! i get home and throw it all away... I've complained one to the waiter, the second time to the manager. Then, i stopped going there for like a year.

I couldnt beleive what i just heard even with the high noise level in there. At this point, I said to myself its just her. We decided to stay because my daughter saw some of her friends and their parents. When my family and I were shown to our table, my wife and I had a feeling that our hostess, Emily, had walked straight to the kitchen. Before we had a chance to take our seats, we decided to head out the door. From here who ever is reading this post I will leave it to your imagination what could have lead if we had stayed.

And if I may say so... NEVER AGAIN! I have been to this chain in other cities before, nothing memorable one way or the other, but the one in the so called town center is dreadful. The food took forever (25 minutes+) and while the server was very polite (we knew it wash't his fault) the manager who came to our table to ""apologize"" (an older gentleman) acted as if we were the problem, not the kitchen. Yes, they were busy (it was around 12:30), but that is really no excuse for an establishment that clearly has dealt with a rush before. In a world where chintzy burger joints abound, skip this one altogether. California Pizza Kitchen is right next door and I would take that (with a wait) any day over Simi Valleys Red Robin.

Came on a Saturday night with the wife, our 2 nieces and nephew. We let them choose where to eat dinner and obviously we end up here. Was excpecting a long wait but to my suprise, we were seated right away. Looking through the menu my mouth starts watering as I read the descriptions fo the burgers. Hopefully they taste as good as they are described I say in my mind. I end up going with the chophouse burger. It comes with horseradish-sautéed mushrooms, steak sauce, Provolone cheese and crispy onion straws. It tasted as if they had taken their time cooking and assemling it. Extremely flavorful. The meat was tender and juicy, just as it should be. Plus it comes with bottomless fries so that does not hurt.  There is a full bar as well.  Had to deduct a star since our waitress hardly came to check on us. We had no drinks for at least 20 minutes. It was a slow night so there is no excuse. Other than that it was all good!

169,Michelle M.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",89,49,3.0,1.0,2012-07-28,"I'd give this restaurant no stars if it would let me!  Where do I start?  I have been to many Red Robins in the past, both locally and other cities.  Its what you'd expect.  Not great, but not usually too bad, kids usually love it because of the balloons and big desserts.  In the past year or two, I have noticed some pretty significant cuts and to some extent of course it makes sense for a business to do what's necessary to ensure they stay afloat.  From what I can tell, how they have trimmed their expenses include no more balloons at all, 1 mini crayon instead of the little crayon box that came with the kids menu.  Now you get like 5 fries in your basket and are expected to ask constantly for more to fill up your plate.   But with all these cuts what has really driven me to want to scream to the rooftops is they have decided that one waiter can sufficiently handle all the tables in the restaurant during the lunch rush hour.  If this had happened to me once, I would say it was unfortunate scheduling but since my daughter has a class near this location at the Simi Town Center I have experienced the exact scenario twice a week apart.    During today's visit my husband and I (with our other baby) decided to give this place another try since its an easy atmosphere with kids.  After we were seated the host asked for our drinks and then the visit went downhill for that.  We had to work to get the very basics like a refill, utensils and napkins.  We put in our order and waited, waited, and waited over 40 minutes for 2 burgers and a kids meal.  And the waiter was never coming.  Instead the host guy was running around picking up all the slack and trying to help where possible.   This visit was extremely frustrating and by the time the food arrived we just wanted to get the check and leave. Oh yeah and the food was cold, bland and tasted like it was sitting under the heat lamps for 40 minutes.

I dined here with my husband, daughter, and 2 young sons on Wednesday and waited at least a half hour before my server, a tall thin guy, greeted us. We waited another 15 minutes before our drinks arrived (5 waters, a lemonade, and an iced tea). When he finally emerged from the kitchen with these, he paraded them around the restaurant for a few minutes before stopping to converse at the table behind us and THEN he gave us our drinks. I ordered an onion soup to start off with but it seems he forgot it. When I asked about it, he FINALLY brought it over and seconds later, our food arrived, which had been sitting in  the window for about 10 minutes. The ranch we asked for never made it over so another server brought it. THE WORST part of all this was that he didn't even know how to hold a glass. I had to ask for a new glass for my daughter since he had grabbed hers around the rim...ewwww! Oh, and no aplogogies there! One burger, one soup, one salad, and two kids meals took 2 hours...on a school night! I will have a real hard time going back but if I do I will remember to ask for the girl with the long straight black hair (I think her name was Gina).

Flat sodas? CHECK. Dry burger buns? CHECK. Slow service? CHECK. Unhelpful hostess? CHECK. Waiting for a life time for a to-go box and check? CHECK. We visited here for a late lunch and sat down and ordered our drinks. Tick, tick, tick, tick... 10 minutes go by and still no drinks. Now there aren't that many people seated but I guess they have way too many tables being waited on one server. Finally we get our drinks and order our food. We ask for fries and it comes 5 minutes later. Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick... 20 minutes pass, food is running late and fries and drinks are long gone. 10 more minutes pass and FINALLY our mediocre food arrives. It was okay, nothing great but nothing too terrible to the point where I get food poisoning. We ask for drinks and again tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick... By the time our drinks came we were almost done so we asked for the check. TICK, TICK, TICK, TICK, TICK, TICK, TICK, MOTHA EFFING TICK... I ask one of the hostess if she could grab me a box for my sons food and she gave me the nastiest looks ever. B*tch it's not my fault your life sucks and you have to work at Red Robins but there are tons of other poor college students that can replace you.  15 minutes pass and we finally get the check and still no box so I ask our waiter to grab one...

184,Michael K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,,1.0,2013-01-19,"The food here is at best...NOT GOOD.  The management is horrible.  I say that because the service is and that's always a reflection on the management.  We unfortunately go there quite a bit because it's easy with kids after a sporting or school event and it's getting consistently worse.  We've been in on weekends and during the week and I've noticed the crowd has decreased quite a bit.  Each time I say I'm never coming back, but like an idiot I do. They are notorious for making use of their food lamps.  We're a family of four and every single time we see our food sitting under the lamps for an average of ten minutes while waiting for the rest of the order to be finished.  Sad thing is we're only talking salads and burgers...nothing complex.  Don't expect anything to be served hot here.  It's just not part of their business model.  They have the lamps so they use them.  Warm is about the best you're gonna get.

I hadn't been to a Red Robin since I was a teenager, but when we needed a place to eat in Simi Valley, our imaginations kind of flagged.  We found ourselves sipping sodas in a booth surrounded by walls of kitsch that were meant to look quirky and eclectic.  The overall effect was 100% chain restaurant chic. Service was decent and the meal was quick.  I had the aforementioned Whiskey River® BBQ Chicken Salad, which came with grilled chicken breast, avocado, and crispy onion over a mix of lettuce, corn, jicama, black beans, diced tomatoes, cheddar cheese, and tortilla strips.  I omitted the ranch but kept the BBQ sauce.  The salad was pretty lackluster, but no worse than expected.  I ate the chicken with a lot of the BBQ sauce, and picked at the rest. It might be a while until my next Red Robin meal, and I'm okay with that.  This was a strictly practical lunch, and I usually stay home for those.  Still, it wasn't bad, and it certainly served its purpose.  I'm sure it's a handy spot for a quick meal in Simi Valley.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-simi-valley?start=60,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.9880000000000004,2.44
124,Billy D.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,38,,1.0,2013-08-29,"I hope the managers and corporate read these things.  This particular Red Robin (Simi Valley, CA) is getting progressively worse with service.  Nothing is made from scratch.  It's all pre-prepared.  All they do is heat up the food, so it's hard to be non-consistent with food quality in that type of environment.  Don't get me wrong, the quality is not great, but at least that's consistent and you know what you get.  This is exactly why it's critical for them to have great service. Went there for lunch this week at a non peak time (2:00).  Service was HORRIBLE.  Server, Emily, couldn't crack a smile if she had to and doesn't grasp the concept of bottomless fries and free refills.  Not one refill.  Onion straws had more grease than a bicycle chain.  Didn't do anything about it.  They serve the food to the table all at once, but make no mistake...they don't prepare the food all at the same time.  We timed how long it took them to serve one of the burgers that had been sitting up there under the lamp.  14 minutes from the time the ""preparer"" placed it under the lamp til the time the server put it on the tray with three other entrees.  All the while the manager is nowhere to be found.  Four servers standing around laughing while the food is under the lamp, one of which has been sitting there for 14 minutes!  See pic on instagram under #poorservice.   Then the manager finally comes out and does nothing, but participate in the humorous conversation being had.  Doesn't lift one finger to help, coach or delegate. Corporate needs to evaluate their onsite leadership and decide if they want to continue to slide down hill in service and have a Denny's type reputation or pick it up and become one of the better family friendly restaurants.  When your business model calls for pre-prepared food there's not much you can do about quality and that's why service becomes key.  Service sets you apart from the other low quality family restaurants. You chains should really take a piece out of the Cheesecake Factory playback.  I don't think you hear too many complaints about their food quality and their service.  In fact, most people rave about.

I ordered fries and a coke. The coke came in a dirty glass, but no one came around again until I got my check so I could say something about it (let me say again: there were NO other patrons!

Fifteen minutes later, we were almost done eating and guess what? still awaiting for the fries and rootbeer, and I started wondering if I really ordered the bottomless fries??? I asked front-lady as she passes by and she told me a scripted-like response, like she saw the bartender busy that's why the floats aren't ready yet. WTH! do you really need a bartender for 2 glasses kid's floats? Well, they served the root beer floats right away, but HALF way full and another 10 (I think 9) pieces of cold fries! I told my wife, we not coming back to this place even it is FREE!!! I might understand the delay if the place was busy, but it wasn't, it was an ordinary Wednesday night with less than half full of customers.

137,Kathy S.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,13,,1.0,2014-04-30,"Went there today and must agree with the majority of posters here...this place sucks.  Went in around lunchtime at 12:30 and sat at the bar since I was alone.  The bartender finally walks up to his register a good 10 feet away and yells at me what I want.  Seriously, he couldn't extend the courtesy of actually walking up to me.  I have to yell back across another patron my order of a Whiskey Chicken Salad.  He also yelled at the other patron (who was 5 feet closer) what he wanted.  The other patron's order came about 15 minutes later.  I sat there patiently being totally ignored, the bartender never came back to inquire if I wanted another drink or to explain the long wait.  After 40 MINUTES I went to the front desk to ask to speak to a manager.  The woman at the front was conversing with the hostess, definitely not paying attention to her ""wait staff"".  When I told her I had a complaint about my long wait she immediately went to the kitchen and I was served about 5 minutes later with a soggy salad that had probably been sitting in dressing for at least 20 minutes.  They COMPED the meal.  Big deal, I don't go out to restaurants looking for free food, I go because I believe the food and service might be good.  The bartender only offered a cursory apology.  I think Mr. Stephen Carley ought to to look at this place and their horrible service.  I know that one bad apple doesn't spoil the entire bunch, but there are a LOT of negative reviews here for a reason.  I agree with the previous poster...go to the pizza kitchen across the sidewalk.  That place had great food and great service.  I will never patronize Red Robin again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-simi-valley?start=160,2.64,2.64,2.64,2.8520000000000003,2.64

Anyway, I asked for well-done fries at the beginning. So, the burgers arrive. The fries I got were normal (and not too warm). Waitress apologized. Fifteen minutes later she said the cook had a way of not cooking the fries well done because he had to send out the regular fries. Did not make sense to me. Ended up saying, that does not matter, there is something wrong in the operations. Her trying to rationalize made things worse. Later the manager comes and I express my disappointment why I could not get crispy or well-done fries when I order it at the outset. To remedy this, he offered to comp me that burger hoping I would give them another try in the future. Sure. Burger I had was OK, but just OK. I am, however, happy the manager did something about it. So, we came back on Memorial Day, not long after the original visit (in fact just 8 days apart). This time we both ordered the Mushroom Burger. I liked the flavor and savory taste of the burger, so did wifey. Fries ordered well done came as ordered without a fuss. Excellent effort and recovery. 4 stars.

52,Amy M.,"Oxnard, CA",1,6,,3.0,2014-06-30,"I have been here many times, with similar results during all those times. The food is always tasty, and arrives quickly. The staff is generally pretty nice. And those bottomless fries... yummy! I don't know why people complain that they ""only"" get 8-10 fries with their order. Well duh, they're huge steak fries! And you can get more for free.  They have a nice variety of American food: burgers, wraps, salads, sandwiches, milkshakes, etc. I also enjoy that they have seasonal items (such as oktoberfest or winter-themed milkshakes and food). Sometimes they'll give you a free sample of a new milkshake or item (one time got free shots!). Prices are typical, $8-$12 for your meal, and a little more for certain themed foods.  So why only 3 stars? No more happy hour : ( First, they downsized their portions, then they raised the price of appetizers and got rid of some of the good ones, then they got rid of happy hour altogether. That's a bummer because that was the best part of the restaurant. I will visit much less now that happy hour is gone (and don't try to tell me that their ""new always low price"" menu compensates for happy hour. It does not). I seriously used to go once a week and now I haven't been since they got rid of happy hour about 2 months ago. I'm in no rush to go back and pay full price for my drinks...  There was one time also where I told the waitress to keep the change and she brought it back, saying ""that's all that was left"". I think she was trying to say that we should have given a better tip. Dear waitresses: don't EVER ask for a bigger tip for just doing your job normally. That was at least 15%. Go above and beyond if you want 25%. It was very awkward and off-putting for us.   It also stinks that I have the royalty card yet have never been able to use it because I either didn't get a burger or someone else in my party wanted to use theirs.

I won't be coming back here. Ever. The hostesses in the front were extremely friendly but that didn't make up for the horrible service from our waiter. I came here on New Year's Eve around 5 and they didn't close until 7 P.M. which was more than enough time to get a quick bite and leave. Our server (who shall remain nameless) was extremely strange. We get that it was New Year's Eve and he probably wanted to leave, but still.. We got there 2 whole hours before they stopped seating people. He made it seem like he didn't want us there and when he talked to us, it sounded as if he was reading off a script. So awkward. Anyways, I love Freckled Lemonade and I think that Red Robin has one of the best, so I ordered that and the Red Robin Gourmet Cheeseburger while my boyfriend ordered the Clucks and Fries. First of all, what happened to their portions? Although the burger was still the same size, the clucks and fries only had 2 pieces of chicken and 3 pieces of baby shrimp along with a pathetic, tiny pile of fries underneath it. I understand that the fries are bottomless so you're able to order more whenever you please. We WOULD have ordered more if our waiter ever came to check up on us, but he never did. I would see him eying our table and walk the opposite direction or look away. By the time we finally got his attention, we weren't even in the mood to eat anymore. He didn't even refill my drink until I was practically waving my hands in the air. Even then, he got my drink order wrong and just gave me plain lemonade.

We decided to splurge and try their Mountain High Mudd Pie that is chocolate ice cream on top of a cookies & cream (ice cream) pie. The cleanliness of the restaurant and the restrooms was great.  The negative: The service was average - our waitress seemed a little distracted. She forgot the suger for our iced teas at first and then only checked in on us once afterwards.She was still very polite and she was very prompt when bringing our food - our wait was failry short.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-simi-valley?start=60,3.32,3.32,3.32,3.152,3.3200000000000003

Lately, however, the service has been extremely lacking at this location!  Today, for example, I was on my lunch break and decided to treat my little sister to lunch at a restaurant of her choosing. Of course, she pick Red Robin as it's a family favs. We were seated by a nice hostess, but thereafter waited nearly 10 minutes until someone asked us for a drink order. Even the nice hostess doubled check with us because we had no drinks at our table. Our drinks came staggered; receiving the fountain drinks 5 minutes after the strawberry lemonade, and a shake much later. It would be another 10 minutes until we saw our waitress again to take our order. When she finally did take our order, she skipped around the table instead of just going in a circle (I shrugged it off as everyone has their own method of working), but then as she took the orders, she said nothing to us just stared down the next person until they realized it was their turn.  By the time the food came, I ended up having to take it to-go. The worst part about this whole experience was I had all the time in the world to count the table/employee ratio and it was a mere 2:1, which I wouldn't call busy at all.  I've worked in a restaurant in the past, so I try to be very easy on restaurant workers knowing how difficult it can be. However, unfortunately, this is not the first poor service I've received at this location. I've noticed that the long-term waiters (I'm talking about you, Laurilee!) have amazing customer service, and the crop of new people over the years seem to have little training on being friendly.

Not to mention, the restaurant has absolutely terrible cell service (at least AT&T). Though, you'd figure not being not far outside the LA area, they'd not only have an allergen menu, but it'd be broken down by food group, day of the week, total calories, and phase of the moon... But apparently, everyone's so tied to the phone and an app, why do they even print menus anymore? Oh well... (FWW, I *have* been too other Red Robins that have full nutritional menus... Maybe this place has removed them to prevent people from casually browsing them, only to suddenly regret what they had ordered?) On the plus side, our server (Erin) handled things very gracefully, and was overly patient with us. Also, the manager, once he was running food, seemed pleasurable. So, a bit of a boost, there. Yes, I actually hate being a bother in restaurants... It stresses me out, and this is supposed to be an easy and pleasurable experience, right?

We said no problem and we would do 2 checks. After ordering drinks the waitress came back and said we couldn't use 2 tablets because it was busy that day and each table needed one. I kid you not, the place was at least half empty. A complete ghost town. So we asked if we could keep the extra tablet until more customers came in. The waitress informed us she had already asked the manager and the manager said absolutely not. We asked to speak to the manager and was told that the manager was in a meeting and couldn't talk to us. Of course with 4 hungry kids we couldn't up and leave so we ordered our food and stayed.

147,A M.,"Simi Valley, CA",0,15,1.0,5.0,2016-04-22,"Just to be fair, they do not deserve my 5 Stars on this Rating; it is meant to add a star to compensate for the review where they got 2 Stars because they could not (not would not) accept a Gift Card due to the system being down. I recall being there around that time, Christmas weekend, and recall the hand written apology signs clearly posted on the front door that Gift Cards can not be accepted at this time - but I chose to eat there and pay rather than NOT eat there and ding them on Yelp!. ************************************** I regularly visit this location and the one in Woodland Hills/Canoga Park, but this review is about my experience today for lunch. I walked in around 1:30 and the host was in the process of seating a young mother and her 2 children; I watched as he accomodated their comfort by removing chairs, etc. He returned and promptly seated me at a small 2 person booth in that narrow strip between the bar section and the restaurant section. I waited a little longer than I liked to have my order taken, but in the meantime anoher server asked if anyone had helped me, took my beverage order and brought it to me. My server appeared shortly after, took my order and it was on.   My 'Shroom Burger with added bacon arrived with ""some pink"" (medium) just as I'd ordered it, with a large amount of mushrooms, a decent amount of crispy bacon, and a modest portion of fries.  Both condiments I'd ordered came with the burger - Blue Cheese and Spicy Ketchup(?)  The burger was tasty, and did not oversaturate the bun with juices; The fries were hot and fresh, just a little bit crispy, but not soft - (My next order of fries were crisper! Love those bottomless fries)  During my meal I'd had both servers check in on me to ask how everything was, and if I needed anything else.  My beverage was refreshed more than once, as well.  When I informed my server that I was 'ready for the check' she waited as I produced my Royalty Club card from my wallet.  3 more to go 'til a Free Burger.  I paid cash, left a tip and I was off. **************************************  As stated, my review is inflated by 1 Star.  Not this visit, but normally that Front Counter reception area has no one there (this time, yes.)  There is a terminal right next to the entry which one of the front section servers was using; facing me but not acknowledging me in the least.  Had I just come in, and not seen the host seating the mother and her 2 kids, I would have had the impression that I was being ignored. A smile and ""someone wiill seat you shortly"" would have gone a long way to avoid that feeling. The wait for taking my order was longer than I was comfortable with, which was lessened by help from another server bringing my beverage. Finally, while the burger was tasty and had ""some pink,"" I did find it drier than normal, as in not as much of the juices as expected.  Guessing that the cook is pressing the meat as it is cooked - squeezing out the juices. Solid 3.5 to 4 Stars - plus 1 Star rounded up (like my tips.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-simi-valley?start=60,3.08,3.07,3.07,2.9000000000000004,3.074

82,Tom B.,"Simi Valley, CA",22,14,4.0,1.0,2016-09-23,"September 23, 2016 at 8:19 pm. We were seated in a booth several feet away from the bar and the two restrooms.  Ahh, the wafted plumes of an industrial chemical disinfectant work wonders with the olfactory senses and human desires of food! The good: Ordered one drink (freckled lemonade), three waters. Food: fish and chips, pretzel bites, and bbq chicken burger with lettuce wrap.  Chicken burger was excellent. The bad: ""Endless"" fries looked and felt like tepid rubber bands.  Who wants an endless supply of stale fish bait?  Pretzel bites were alternately warm and cold with a rubbery texture and ""tooth-flossing capable"" surface.  The cheese was interesting... rather mildly put... it looked melted but with a color not unlike that of the discharge from a nose-clogging sinus infection.  The texture was similar to ear wax, soft and sticky.  It was cold and unappetizing. Similar to the glacial pace of our server, the fish and chips had a few slow moments as well.  Fries lacked warmth and exuded a look of being purely artificial, as if they had been purchased from a novelty store that carries only fake food used on film sets.  We ordered another set of fries; two baskets arrived and were a bit warmer, but not fresher. The fish was cold.  The tartar sauce was warm, very warm.  I had specifically asked for the sauce to be quite cold.  It is a little after 9 pm at this moment... I will let my dear readers know of any bouts with food poisoning should it occur later this evening. The ugly: The bill came to $38.51.  I left two twenty dollar bills with no tip - eh, $1.49.  TIP is an acronym meaning ""To Insure Promptness"".  Tonight it was: ""Thoroughly Incompetent Personnel"".  The service was equally terrible: random movements of staff exhibiting molecular ""Brownian Motion"" as they rushed to and fro with furrowed brows and downcast eyes... now, I know you can point out correctly that the evening was Friday - I expected it to be busy...however; there were many empty tables near us... a few people waiting to enter the restaurant were outside.  Most likely, the others went home to watch the ceremonies involving Vin Scully at Dodgers Stadium. I will not eat here again... come on, Red Robin!  What happened to your impeccable service and willingness to make things right?  I told a hostess on the way out that ""the food was terrible"".  She shrugged her shoulders.  I was given no comment card, and no web address to advise the management/owner.  So... you will be notified in this public forum rather than a simple, albeit private, email. Conclusion: Try the pizza across the way in the next door restaurant.  The organized atmosphere there is far more conducive to permitting efficient food service with freshness as its watchword; not at Red Robin where the service emulated the confused, illogical and frenetic activity that occurs when one uses a heavy boot and stomps upon a red ant hill in the desert floor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-simi-valley?start=20,3.04,3.19,3.19,2.02,3.13

He went to the car to drop off our packages while I went into the restaurant to get a seat. Silly me. There was no hostess in sight. I paced back and forth hoping someone would think I was lost and speak to me. But no. I waited and waited and waited and waited. Then I waited some more. My husband came in and asked me what I was doing. He obviously had never seen WAITING  before. Then, from across the room, she emerged, and noticed me, covered in cobwebs. She sprinted pasted the tables and greeted me cheerfully, as if I hadn't grown another year older waiting to meet her. Our waitress Mandy was happy and efficient. She brought our drinks right away and took our order for two burgers which took 50 MINUTES TO ARRIVE AT OUR TABLE. The place wasn't busy, empty tables everywhere. My husband looked at the burgers and said 'Why did this take 50 MINUTES?' We didn't have a clue. We were clueless. As usual. I had the Southern Charm burger, which was anything but charming. I ordered it medium rare. It was well done. Really well done, dry, small-brick-like. When Maddy asked if everything was okay I showed her the tiny brick and said it should have been medium rare. She offered to take it back and bring another but I needed to be home before Valentine's Day. I slathered it in BBQ sauce and ate half. My dog enjoyed her half but she's not as picky as me. Plus she didn't have to pay for it. Oh, did I mention the onions, or lack thereof? The picture in the menu shows mounds of grilled onions. My overcooked burger showed three little strings, which were hiding under the two tiny pieces of bacon. I had a side salad with it, bleu cheese dressing was okay, bagged salad lettuce was turning brown. We left Maddy a good tip because the lousy food and slow kitchen and disappearing hostess weren't her fault.

I was in a hurry by the time I was able to pay for the meal so I didn't check the containers. That was a mistake. Our lettuce-wrapped burgers were just the contents of the burger thrown in a box with white and yellow stems of lettuce heads. It was a mess. Everything was water logged. I ended up eating a soggy, cold veggie patty and wet cheese with a fork since the $1.49 lettuce wraps didn't exist.

We normally eat at the one in Northridge since we live in east Simi.  Since we had gone to see Cars 3 at the Studio Movie Grill and it was a bit to early for dinner we thought lets use our free 10th burger and eat there. Boy was that a mistake. We got there around 6:15pm we were hungry.  I think we had a new waitress who didn't seem to know much. I asked her if the free burger would be the cheaper one or the more expensive. She went to ask came back and said the more expensive one. We knew what we wanted and ordered quickly.Than close to an hour went by and nothing. I'm diabetic and felt like I need to eat since I had lunch at noon. So I stopped her and asked her where our food was. Than a few minutes later she came by and said it's almost ready than another 5/10 minutes goes by and I complained again than she said your food is ready. Than the manger came over and said there was some computer glitch. So we said okay just glad to have food to eat. Than my husbands burger was the fancy one but looked like a McDonalds burger for $11.99. He complained and they made him another but no mention of comping anything. So my husband had the manger come back and she said she'd take a % off the bill. So when I went to pay they only took off $6.75 for the burger. I told he gal it was suppose to be $11.99. The manger came over and said it's usually the cheaper burger but I said the cheaper burger was $8.99 not $6.75. It was a big mess got some $$ off, but my husband got sick off the burger.

As usual everyone ordered their apps and food. I had the Chicken Ensenada Platter since I'm not a big burger fan. Drinks came, apps came, than the food came. Took a bite of my chicken and it felt like rubber. After checking my food I realized the CHICKEN was RAW!!! Called the waitress and she apologized and took my replacement order. Manager came and also apologized. Waitress was great, everything else except the chicken was great. Daughter got her song and sundae, she was happy! Got the check and I was sort of thrown? No free app, no free drink or no discount. Not that I expected anything, but something would have gone a long way and maybe this rating would have been a positive one after serving RAW Chicken.

4,Brian P.,"Santa Barbara, CA",187,7,2.0,1.0,2017-09-06,"I don't usually write negative reviews, especially after having worked in a restaurant for several years as a bartender and knowing how stressful it can be, but good lord... my family and I had a really embarrassing and awkward meal at this Red Robin. We came in about 7pm on a Saturday and only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. After being seated we were greeted by our server Dakota. It wasn't super busy that night but he seemed rushed. He impatiently took our drink orders and returned with waters (which no one asked for) and instead of handing them out, he put each one down and literally slid them across the table to each person as we all looked on horrified that one may fall over on us.  Whatever, he must have been busy, but come on man at least pretend that you aren't miserable and take it out on us.  Our food arrived and it was what you'd expect from a chain like this, but not more than 5 minutes later he comes over and asks us ""Do you guys want anything else?"" not ""How's your food, anyone need more fries?"" (since they're supposed to be bottomless) And since we weren't even half way through, we all just kind of shrugged and said we were good. He then proceeds to grab the little kiosk i-pad thing and and punched a few buttons taking us directly to the tipping page of the bill.  We weren't even close to done, and here he is pretty much asking us to pay without even giving us the chance to see the bill, like ""Can you guys please GTFO?""  Almost in shock, I just grab my card and swipe. Not even looking at the total. So we finish up and walk out the door really annoyed at the way we had just been treated. As we are walking through the mall, we hear Shiloh... err Dakota yelling ""Hey! Did you guys pay?!?"" We all looked back stunned, like ""WTF? Are you accusing us of dining and dashing?"" I'm already pissed about the crappy service, so I say ""Uh yeah man. On the kiosk. What's the problem?""  To which he tells us that we paid the wrong check somehow, even though he set us all up and didn't even let us see our check. Well, apparently he put the wrong check on our kiosk thing and it was for less. So, instead of admitting his mistake and apologizing, he runs back in and sends out a manager and some other big dude to talk to us. We are completely confused and embarrassed now as their are people staring at the developing scene.  The manager explains that we paid the wrong check and that we need to void that transaction and pay again, and that we would have two charges on our card and mostly likely the void wouldn't process until 4 days later because of Labor Day. So, the dude from the movie Waiting messes up, now we gotta have $200 missing out of our checking account for the next 4 days. So my wife, who doesn't take crap from anyone, and I agreed ""Hey, you guys messed up, Dakota setup the bill and didn't even let us see it before rushing us out, so you're gonna have to eat the $30 and thanks for making us all embarrassed and causing a scene."" We just walked away after another manager came out and told all the other guys to come back inside and drop it.  So, it's safe to say we'll never be coming back there. If anyone in management is reading this, then please teach your staff how to treat customer's with some respect. We were super chill the whole night and did nothing to warrant the crappy treatment. People like Dakota and the management are the reason why chain restaurants like yours are dying off. We pay top dollar for burgers and fries and get a side of attitude for free.

2,Shark G.,"Simi Valley, CA",12,15,,2.0,2017-10-02,"Red Robin used to be my go-to restaurant when I was in the mood for a burger, a shake, and table service. I would visit an average of once a month, it seemed. The Simi Valley location has disappointed me so much, however, that I hardly ever visit anymore. The food is mostly still good. I have experienced the occasional cold basket of fries but overall the food itself isn't my complaint. The main source of my frustration with this place is that ever since they placed those service kiosks at every table, server attentiveness has gone WAY DOWN. The first time I noticed this, a year or two ago, our waiter dropped off our food and never came to check on us. I needed extra napkins and a refill on my fries so I hit the button on the kiosk to summon him -- he never came. He walked right past us several times and we were ignored. In fact, our order was slightly wrong but I couldn't get anyone's attention to get it fixed. Fast forward a year or so and we decide to go against our better judgment and give this place another shot. I'll not make that mistake again for a long time. Service was unbearably slow -- once seated, it took at least ten minutes for a server to introduce themselves and get a drink order. Food took almost an hour to arrive -- so long that my wife had to leave with our kids before food arrived because it was getting past their bedtime and they were HUNGRY still. The rest of us checked with a manager and our food had seemingly just been sitting in the kitchen for some time. Never saw our server again but the manager checked on us once or twice more after that, but I was too much in a hurry to care as I needed to get my wife and kids' food in a box so I could rush home and let her eat. Red Robin used to be a fantastic place. I miss it being my go-to restaurant. But I cannot endorse this restaurant in good conscience again until they ditch the kiosks and get back to a basic understanding of what customer service looks like.
