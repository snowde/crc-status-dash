20,Ty L.,"Spencer, IA",41,23,4.0,1.0,2016-05-07,"Horrible service! Burger was made incorrectly, had to remind server several time to refill fries, was charged for a second drink and wouldn't have received it without asking repeatedly! Wont go back unless they get this fixed!

16,Gerald C.,"Harrisburg, SD",0,49,,1.0,2016-05-08,"Bottom line.....given the over-hyped food and flat out crapy service this place just ain't worth your time or money.......:and money you will spend here, a lot of it! We ordered the prime dip, bacon cheese burger and chicken fingers.......all plates came out warm at best, not hot as you would expect just coming off the grill.  I can see why the fries are unlimited.....after one serving you have gotten a years worth of salt.  Our server was slow on the draw for everything......and at the end of our meal we had to ask a passing hostess for a take home box.  UNIMPRESSED. Will not be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-sioux-falls,2.6280000000000006,2.6280000000000006,2.6280000000000006,2.6280000000000006,2.628000000000001
23,Katie D.,"Sioux Falls, SD",0,1,,4.0,2016-05-12,Very good food!! Kinda pricy but overall very good service and all of our drinks (five of us total) were constantly being refilled when they needed to be! Our waiter was wonderful! I can't wait to go back again!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-sioux-falls?start=20,,,,,
18,Lance D.,"Sioux Falls, SD",9,11,1.0,5.0,2016-05-12,"We were a group of 5... Got seated right away...

26,Krystal T.,"Sioux Falls, SD",18,5,2.0,4.0,2016-05-29,"When we walked in I was skeptical because while the host Drew (I think) was friendly enough the female host whose name I didn't see was not very welcoming. However, our server Melissa was very friendly though and made the excellent recommendation of pretzel bites for an app and when I ordered fries and a side Caesar salad she switched things around to make it the best deal financially without my asking which was appreciated. The food and drinks too quite a while but was definitely worth the wait, best burger and best Caesar salad I've had in town! The only cons were how long it took for our food and drinks and I felt bad for the servers because i saw at least two different times when the hosts at least double sat the servers. Melissa was one of these but luckily was able to manage well... I would suggest the hosts work on their job while the service itself was perfect!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-sioux-falls?start=20,,,,,
21,N S.,"Spencer, IA",18,32,55.0,4.0,2016-06-01,"Nice to see this conveniently in a mall.  Food was decent. Service was great.  Very crowded seating, so don't expect your usual Red Robin experience though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-sioux-falls?start=20,,,,,
19,Mandy C.,"Huron, SD",11,9,,2.0,2016-06-17,"When we went here in May 2016, we had a pretty good waiter. It does take awhile to get your order, and when it arrived it was nice and hot, which was much appreciated. My drink was delayed because of an ""accident"" at the bar. The atmosphere is also dreadfully noisy and if it's your birthday, they will sing you an awful rendition of the ""Sound off"" army ditty. You don't want to go here for a relaxing evening. I would not return because it's a bit pricy for a somewhat ordinary meal I could get in my hometown.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-sioux-falls,,,,,
25,Denise H.,"Mitchell, SD",0,23,3.0,3.0,2016-06-26,"My daughter and I ate lunch today (Sunday).  We arrived around 11:15 and were seated immediately.  When we left 45 minutes later, there were around 20 people waiting to be seated.  Speaking of seating, ask for a table or booth along the perimeter of the restaurant.  The tables in the center parts of each dining area are quite close together.  I commend the staff for working so efficiently within the confines of the tables and chairs.  Our service overall was great - our server was timely with taking our orders and checking back throughout our meal. My daughter ordered the kids mac 'n' cheese meal and the pretzel bites appetizer.  She devoured the mac 'n' cheese and gave it a two-thumbs up!  Upon first sight, the pretzel bites resemble mini corn dogs.  However, once you bite into them, they are soft and delicious.  I ordered the fried pickle chips as an appetizer and the southwest sombrero salad for my meal.  As a regular consumer of fried pickles, these were the most disappointing one's I've had.  The breading overwhelmed the pickle chips - both in the fact that there was just too much breading and the fact that it was so salty even I didn't like it ... and I like salty foods.  For the first time ever, I didn't eat hardly any of my pickle order.  The salad was good ... not great or exceptional, but good.  It's a unique presentation ... the salad items are all mixed together in the center of the plate, the chicken breast sits off to one side and the tostada sombrero sits off to the other side.  Again, the salad tasted good - it just wasn't anything extraordinary.  I didn't care for the jalapeno spread on the sombrero, but the chicken breast had excellent flavor. Overall, it was an OK meal.  Like I mentioned, the service was really good and other than the fried pickles, we ate all of our food.  We'll go back again and try something different next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-sioux-falls?start=20,,,,,
17,Jeremy E.,"Alpharetta, GA",39,11,3.0,1.0,2016-07-11,Problems from the hostesses that thought you could bust a table by using an iPad to waiting forever for our food.  New Management needed!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-sioux-falls,,,,,
11,Angie B.,"McMinnville, OR",37,24,28.0,5.0,2016-07-25,Pretty busy for lunch today- only waited 15 minutes. Burgers were phenomenal- my son had the black and bleu burger and loved it!!

15,Holly J.,"Sleepy Eye, MN",9,4,1.0,5.0,2016-09-03,"Loved the first visit with Aubrey our waitress Friday, we went back again today! Had Derek as our waiter but had the same great service again even after a 40 minute wait.  We will definitely make it our go to spot whenever we return! Also, loved the fact that you can check in and they text you when they have a table so you can keep shopping!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-sioux-falls,,,,,
10,Kyle J.,"Minneapolis, MN",71,8,,3.0,2016-09-22,"Went for lunch and we were able to get seated right away, but that was the only thing the happens quick. Once we were seated we waited 10-15 minutes for someone to take our drink orders, and 10 minutes later the drinks showed up and so did our waitress.  We ordered our Mac n cheese burgers with the garlic fries. The fries were absolutely delicious!!  We will probably go back just hope the service increases.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-sioux-falls,,,,,
13,Don O.,"Leesburg, FL",3,7,2.0,4.0,2016-11-18,"Finding the place was somewhat of a challenge but well worth the search. Nice sports bar atmosphere, great food and super service.

14,Christopher W.,"Sioux Falls, SD",27,4,3.0,2.0,2016-11-30,"Looked forward to trying, was seated promptly at bar.  Took about 15 minutes to get a drink and about 25 minutes after being seated was finally able to place order.  They wanted us to use little kiosk, which I find something more for fast food.  Ordered soup for appetizer which took a good 30 minutes-it came out cold.  They brought out another which also was lukewarm, after an hour of this we left and went to TC'S Referee which was very good.  Red Robin won't last long unless it ups its game.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-sioux-falls,,,,,
22,Kelly T.,"Purcellville, VA",0,1,,4.0,2016-12-31,"Went the day after Christmas, so it was packed. We had a 45 minute wait, in which we wandered around the mall, then got a text that our table was ready. Our waitress was fantastic, she came by at the right times to get drink refills. I had the Southern Charm burger, with no pink and it was perfect and delicious, but the fries were a little on the skimpy side for a serving size. But otherwise will definitely return to this Red Robin!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-sioux-falls?start=20,,,,,
12,Heather H.,"Chester, SD",0,16,2.0,3.0,2017-01-15,"We have been there 5 times since they opened here. The servers are consistently the best aspect to the place, the food and drinks are always good (never great but good). The cleanliness aspect is always noticeable, as there are always issues not being addressed on the floor and tables that have been ""cleared"" not cleaned!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-sioux-falls,,,,,
9,Donna D.,"Tea, SD",0,5,,1.0,2017-05-28,"We ordered the Irish Beer Shake (don't think there was any alcohol in it) and the mixed drink called Sand in Your Shorts (again, didn't taste any alcohol) before ordering a shrimp appetizer (the coating fell off at the first bite).  We had to ask for napkins and silverware.  The burger we ordered was supposed to be medium but was very red inside and the chicken sandwich was partially pink inside.  I ordered a second Sand in Your Shorts and my husband ordered an Old Fashioned (still couldn't tell there was a drop of alcohol in either one).  We told the waitress about the chicken being pink and the manager took the sandwich off the bill and he gave us a coupon for a free chicken sandwich the next time we come in.  Not sure we'll be back.  Go to Granite City up the street!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-sioux-falls,,,,,
0,Tina P.,"Las Vegas, NV",178,148,62.0,5.0,2017-08-14,"Our first time to this location and it won't be our last!  My daughter and I both have gluten allergies and they have a separate Frier that only prepares the steak fries so there is no risk of cross contamination. The manager, Lyle, came out to personally go through the ingredients to make sure that the food would be ok.  Our food came out and Lyle made sure everything was ok, actually before it even came out he had sent back one meal because it wasn't up to standards. He then comped my daughter's burger since it took so long to come out. He also made sure that any refills of fries came out gluten free.  Our server made sure our drinks were always full and checked on us often.  Thanks, Lyle and Red Robin for taking good care of us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-sioux-falls,,,,,
4,Walt P.,"Las Vegas, NV",77,263,58.0,5.0,2017-08-21,Management here is wonderful. My wife has a gluten allergy and not only did they have a gluten free menu the manager came out and discussed menus options. He even said they have a separate fryer for non gluten items. This was so cool because when traveling in the upper Midwest this is usually unheard of.  The food was great and fresh I had the whiskey chicken BBQ salad and it was huge and made perfectly. My kids had burgers and the manager observed that one was over cooked before it left the kitchen and he had it remade without waiting for a customer complaint. Talk about being proactive and great customer service he even apologized and comped a burger.   I don't know where they found this manager but Red Robin is extremely fortunate to have him because with his skills he should be working at a 5 star restaurant not at a chain restaurant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-sioux-falls,,,,,
8,Rick H.,"Sioux Falls, SD",0,46,2.0,1.0,2017-09-03,"Took an hour to get our food.   Complained to the waiter who thought we had already eaten.  Had to ask for drink refills.  Manager brought our food, put it down and said, ""No bill today."" and walked away...No apologies etc.  Fries cold and soggy...Asked for refill that never came.  Got up and left... Not going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-sioux-falls,,,,,

7,Sara P.,"Monroe, SD",0,9,4.0,1.0,2017-09-24,"My favorite was the French Onion soup this visit it came to me with mostly burnt onions.  They did take it off my final bill.  My daughter had to wait a very long time for her burger sauce, fry and drink refills.  Our server was stressed and busy she ignored our table after the soup went back and a table of 11 arrived in her section.  Had to wait about 15 minutes upon arriving to be seated.  Not happy at all!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-sioux-falls,,,,,
6,Alison H.,"Sioux Falls, SD",0,14,,4.0,2017-10-27,"I was really excited when I first learned that Red Robin was coming to Sioux Falls.  I love the food here.  The Banzai Burger and Whiskey River Wrap are two of my favorites.  The mud pie is also delicious if you save room for dessert.  The service here is not good.  I've probably had good service 3 times.  It's sometimes slow or the server never returns to see how the food is.  I still go here because I like the food, but I would enjoy it even more if the service were better!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-sioux-falls,,,,,
1,Pilar G.,"Columbia, SC",3,97,4.0,1.0,2017-12-08,"This was the worst dining experience I have had in an extremely long time. We sat for 15 minutes before being greeted and another ten before drinks. The waitress was extremely LOUD. I winced each time she came to the table. The appetizer arrived 25 minutes after ordering. They were boneless chicken wings and they were cold and barely tossed in sauce. They were dropped unceremoniously on the table and not served with the ranch they were supposed to come with. I was not expecting a five star meal. Just a decent meal at a chain restaurant. We waited ten minutes for water refills.  After an hour, our burgers arrived. They were also cold and the orders were wrong. The managers were sweet and did what they could to rectify the disaster of a meal with some comps but we will not be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-sioux-falls,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006

2,James N.,"Sioux Falls, SD",19,2,1.0,1.0,2018-01-13,This was one of the worst dining experiences of my life. First of all no hostess in the front to seat us. Then the place is filthy we sat right next to what I can only call the employees pic trough for them to walk by and eat and drink right next to us. How unprofessional. Also if you advertise endless fries you shouldn't have to wait 15 min. I will never eat here again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-sioux-falls,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004
