213,Gayle R.,"Forest Park, IL",0,20,,1.0,2012-02-17,"My daughter and I went to Red Robin last Sunday, we just had to have a burger!!!  Our previous experience at this restaurant was a rude and inattentive waiter, but we decided to give it another try.  We walked in just after they opened, we were the first people seated on the restaurant side of the restaurant.  Our waitress came she was nice, friendly attentive (unlike last time) we received our drinks, and placed our order.  While waiting for our food, a single lady came in and was seated 2 booths over, and then a few minutes later and the family with 4 children under the age of 5 came in.  Can you guess where they seated them???  If you guessed RIGHT ACROSS THE AISLE FROM US, you are correct!!!!!!  There must be at least 20-25 other tables, and the hostess insisted on seating them across the aisle from us, even when the Mom asked to be seated near the windows the hostess said here would be fine.  Now I do not blame the parents, nor the kids, for being kids, I blame the hostess and the management.  Within 3 minutes the kids started screaming, and shrieking.  I got up walked toward the kitchen area and asked the gentleman there if he was the manager.  He indicated he was, I explained the situation, and he said he would talk with the hostess.  When I went to sit down the shrieks were continuing and we grabbed our coats and left.   When I got home I emailed the customer service department about our experience, and received 2 phone calls this week from management, which proceeded to eat my voice mail.  Today I got an email from the Customer Service Manager stating the management was trying to contact me, I feel at this point WHY BOTHER???  There is nothing they can do or say at this point that would change my mind about ever going near the restaurant in this lifetime. To say this was a dismal experience would be an understatement.  Does it not occur to businesses that sometimes adults want to eat a meal in peace and quiet without kids screaming in their ears?    I can see at 3:00 in the afternoon, but at 11AM on a Sunday?  We go at that time TO AVOID THE KIDS CHAOS! So I will take my ADULT DOLLARS to another business who's staff knows about respectful seating arrangements.

95,Lupe D.,"Chicago, IL",158,431,432.0,3.0,2012-03-26,"I was craving a burger in the worst way, and decided to try Red Robin.  It wasn't great, it wasn't awful, it just was.  I was more impressed with the appetizers and the bottomless steak fried fries than I was with the burger itself.   I don't know why I was expecting a thicker patty...maybe I built up this place in my mind, maybe my craving in mind also imagined that the burger it was going to get would resemble a Kuma's type burger.  Well, I got a Red Robin Burger..to be exact, I got the Whiskey BBQ burger, with ceddar cheese and I paid extra for some bacon.  You know, it was just ok.  I was looking for that smokey, BBQ burger flavor, and all I tasted was the bun, mayo,veggies and a little bit of the burger.  Like I said, it wasn't bad, and I DID eat it, but I just kept thinking that for the same money, I could have had the burger I really wanted at that OTHER place I mentioned previosly...but let's stay on subject.  I mean, the meat itself could have used some of that famous Red Robin Seasoning they had on all the tables.   We also had some appetizers which I have to say I really really liked, and is what will probably bring me back.  Their onion rings are really good, as are their mushrooms.  Despite what everyone says, not everything that is fried is good...but these babies are!  Nice and crispy, seasoned perfectly.  I also really liked their dipping sauces, and I usually never dip my onion rings..this time, I couldn't get enough of that stuff!! One more thing I noticed, other than milkshakes, they only have like 3 dessert choices??  What's up with that?  I gave up chocolate for lent so that left me with 1 choice.  So we skipped dessert.  hmmmm, not good. Wait time?  Well, we got really lucky, we waited about 10 minutes before we got seated, when we left people were waiting inside and out.  YIKES, I don't think it's worth more that a 15 minute wait.  Sorry, but it's not.  Once we were seated we had no issues whatsoever, our waitress was very nice and attentive.

Sorry, the burger was soggy, limp, and tasteless.  Since I don't eat pickles, I asked for no pickles.  I also read they're famous for their pickle relish, so I asked for it on the side so I could apply liberally myself if I wanted.  What I received was a burger with 6 giant slices of pickles inside and a side of salsa.  I lost.  For $3-4 extra dollars, I could've had a decent burger from Three Aces or even Kuma's.

Well, we must have been on a roll because we had an equally lousy meal. The sticky menu did nothing to set a positive tone, nor did the screaming child, but I was still willing to give it a shot. Christopher liked the cole slaw that came with his disappointing burger. I liked the glass my margarita came in. The margarita itself was ok, but nothing special. I had a cup of French onion soup that was tasteless. I also had their riblet appetizer which was awful. I got a side of broccoli with it instead of fries. It was totally unseasoned rabbit food.

185,Hanna D.,"Chicago, IL",14,24,6.0,2.0,2012-04-11,"Gross, gross and more gross.  The appetizer - Cheeseburger Queso or something like that was some stale velvetta with ground beef nibblettes that had more grease then actual meat.  When we let it sit for a bit all the grease rose to the top of the bowl! Nasty!!!  After seeing the grease in that I decided against a burger, and opted for mac & cheese with a side salad. the mac wasnt hot, and the cheese was still in its shredded state on the top.  I think the pasta gets shipped in with butter on it because there was an odd white-ish non-cheese substance on my noodles. My friend that got the burger was sorely disatisfied too.  The company in the restaurant was somewhat confusing, screaming children mixed with an old-timer hick dive-bar crowd.... I felt bad for the waitress - Amanda - because she knew the food she was serving was crap. She was super nice & was over at our table with refills & to make small talk a few times.

I've had many things of the menu, but my favorite is their Guacamole Burger and Garlic Fries.  The Wings are not bad, but if I want some wings, I'll go next door to Buffalo Wile Wings. When I need to eat healthy, I have a Turkey Burger.  The meat is still pretty good.  The prices are not bad at all.  I enjoy the burgers so much, I lick my fingers afterwards.   The only thing I don't like about this place is that they got rid of several of my favorite burgers, including the Santa Fe.  Sigh.  Bring it back please?

It is a happy environment to be in for some reason because you know you are about to stuff your face with an awesome tasting burger. Honestly, there are many good burger joints out there, but what brings me back here is the bottomless fries and freckled lemonade. The beauty about their lemonade is that you can switch to other flavors, so for the price of one, you can try the others. Also, if you have enough people, definitely get the towering onion rings! I have tried many of the sandwiches here before, but my favorite is the A1 Peppercorn Burger. I substitute the regular fries for the garlic fries, which is 10x better in my opinion.

I'm also trying to figure out if our server was passive-aggressively racist. My friend and I got out of a movie, and she likes fries so I thought ""endless bottom refills"" would be great. I typically like Red Robin when tried in other states, but the restaurant chain was new to her. The server only talked to my friend when taking her order. After that, she blatantly only talked to me, or actually waited to talk to my friend when her mouth was completely full as if to make her look dumb or socially awkward. I actually asked, ""Would you like to talk to her? She's sitting right there,"" in a calm, personable voice when the server was asking me about her food before my friend had taken a bite and long before she finally turned to ask. The server completely ignored us while nearing the end of everyone else in her section being cleared.  That wasn't the biggest thing noticed, though. I'm Caucasian and my friend is African American. Neither of us drink alcohol, and I wondered if that was the issue. We were sitting in the bar area (faster time for being seated), waiting for service while a table within a foot of us with two Asian American gentlemen who were seated after us got waited on faster and finished first, leaving first, with the same or more food.  At first, the server was almost in our faces every two seconds asking how the food was when we hadn't had a chance to take a bite yet. My friend's food was cold and they got her order wrong twice. The first time, I thought that maybe they tried correcting it, but there were other issues that made her unhappy like the food not being what I should be, and then items that looked like they were leftover from other people's orders. I wasn't sure what was happening, but afterward my friend pointed out that every non-""white"" person she served (and yes, there were plenty in the section), she took a long time doing it while the white tables changed out rapidly and received food earlier.  I have friends of every nationality and ethnicity and haven't seen this before moving to Chicago although I've lived around the country.

135,Alex M.,"Chicago, IL",1,28,,2.0,2014-07-10,"I generally like and go to this Red Robin because it was better than the one at the Hip. I like it because they typically seperated the adult couples with the teenages and families. This being said, they need to train their hostess' better.  I went there last week at around 7pm during a weekday. They had a few but not alot of customers. There was no one standing in line. I don't think this is their closing time. The hostess greeted my wife and I, and sat us next to 4 teenage girls and walked away. The family section was open with a few groups. Plenty of space everywhere. I am guessing the adult section was full and this why we were placed in the family section. I asked to be reseated so she sat us next to the changing/dish station. Was this out of spite? I asked to be reseated again. She gave me this attitude like ""just sit, I've got things to get done.""  Restaurants need to understand that we dont care which server is next in line for customers. We dont care that you are trying to close a section for the night. 7pm is not late. The cleaning/ dish station, the seat by the kitchen door, next to spoiled brats, and by the restrooms are the last locations an adult couple would like to be seated. So unless the place is packed, don't sit us there. The preference is not yours, but should be the customers. If there are seats open, please seat us in the booth on the big wall. The food and server were good but the attitude of the hostess spoiled everything.

We got to our table and I noticed there was only one waitress working on the bar side.  It took a while for her to come to our table, we were actually just about to get up and leave because we had such a bad taste in our mouth about them making us wait for no reason.  We put our order in and had no issues with the waitress she was nice but why was she the only one?  She brought out our silverware which looked disgusting!

When I asked the host why were the other people seated before us she said that the 21+ area was full and the ""family"" area was freeing up which I think it's a bunch of BS since she wasn't asking anyone's age nor did she asked if we had a preference as of where to be seated; she just took names and called names.

By the time we sat down was still a decent crowd. My buddy ordered the spinach artichoke dip. Always a favorite, right? It would have been good if they gave us enough chips. Seriously it was about a handful of chips. The waiter said he'd come back with more but by the time the chips came the dip had cooled down. Kind of annoyed by that. Strike 1.  We ordered everything at once and by the time we received the appetizer it was pretty empty in the dining room. So we'd probably get our food quickly, right? Wrong!  At other locations during busy times, food would come out in like 10 minutes. It was probably closer to 25 minutes. And we would have asked our waiter but he was nowhere to be found during that time. Strike 2.  Instead of bottomless fries I wanted the broccoli with my French dip meal. Did I get broccoli? Nope. Gave me fries and had to wait for him to bring the broccoli. Strike 3.  Since it took so long to get the food it was practically cold by the time I ate it. Strike 4.

98,Dennis D.,"Lincolnwood, IL",1,12,,2.0,2015-05-06,Really. The burgers here are varied and quite good. You get endless fries or veggies or fruit with most burgers.    This location  is clean and well kept up but the seating area outside of the bar area does not give you a feeling of being in a decent restaurant. Feels more like Denny's in the dining room areas.     I would have rated this location higher because the service is very good from the waitresses and bartender but the staff at the front desk is downright rude. Instead of being welcoming to people they act like antagonists. This isn't just one incident nor is  it just our personal opinion. Others were also grumbling at the many times we have visited.     I don't know where their training and manners came from but it wasn't Emily Post or Dear Abbey.     Too bad because the food is decent and the options are many. There are different size burgers and chicken dishes too.     How do the burgers stack up with other places? A little better than some well known burger emporiums but the fall short of the best ones. That said. The prices are reasonable and the bill won't kill you. It's comfortable and really family friendly.     Ask for more fries at anytime. The good waitresses will start you off with some fries. Thick cut steak fries properly done.     They also have  some bottomless drinks like root beer floats.     It is recommended by me if you sit in bar area and can avoid the combat onslaught at the front door. You will like the food.   I added this tag because now they have automated reorder machines on the table where you order from or call the waiter. So much for personal service.  This isn't a drive through fast food place. This makes the service more inattentive than before. With this new feature you do not feel cared for or even wanted.

My daughter ordered a patty melt on marble rye, medium, with sweet potato fries, and the burger was cooked perfectly and very tasty. The downside was the dirty table on one side of us, which stayed that way the whole time we were there. The family on the other side of us left and their table remained dirty as well. There were many workers there, including what looked to be a manager walking around, yet no one seemed to notice these tables. This was very unappetizing. Unfortunately our main complaint was the service. Our server was very nice, but very inattentive. He took our order, brought our drinks and food, and we didn't see him again for a long time. He only checked on us once the entire time we were there. We had to look for him for salad dressing, extra napkins, refills on drinks, and worst of all, our check. We had finished eating and sat waiting for the check for a long while so we could leave. Mind you it was late afternoon and he had a few tables, but I couldn't imagine having him serve us at night when it's busier.

Two were eating over the food they were cooking. One continued to wipe his nose and keep cooking. One repeatedly threw fries at other staff. The waitresses were at their service bar eating over the sauces they were dishing up. I watched one waitress cash out a customer who paid cash, clear a table, put her hands on the back of a customer and then went behind the counter and took shredded cheese from the bin WITH HER BARE HAND and sprinkled it on two salad plates. She then served them to customers. The manager was standing beside these people and never said a word. Never again!!! Someone from Red Robin did write and apologized. She sent me a $20 gift card. That wS enough to get me back to the chain again but not the Skokie store.  Three of us ate dinner tonight and two out of three were disappointed. The fried fish was probably slightly frozen when fried, which caused a textural issue and made the coating fall off. The batter was soggy and the liquid from the fish had run into the basket and soaked the fries.  My Banzai dinner salad was written up on the menu as having fresh grilled pineapple, mandarin oranges, almonds, greens, and chicken. The pineapple was canned and fried which was disappointing. The greens included beet greens which have such a strong flavor by themselves and they didn't blend with the other flavors. The salad came with ""garlic bread"" but it was closer to a large Garlic crouton soaked in butter.  Not my favorite meal.  My daughter ordered the Royal Red Burger and she was delighted. It was cooked as ordered and very tasty.  The service was delightful, friendly, attentive, and most enjoyable. Thank you Travis!

38,Jon D.,"Hurlburt Field, FL",4,30,20.0,2.0,2015-10-22,This should be my second review of this place. Not sure if I posted the last one. But this place is going to hell. Second time we were served cold breadsticks and lukewarm spinach dip. After talking with a manager the first time you'd think they would keep an eye on it. Last time our waiter explicitly stated that the bread was kept under a heat lamp after being baked in the AM. Gross. Entrees were good. But the service degrades the place and the unfriendly atmosphere is rancid. Fool me once... Fool me twice...

82,Consumer A.,"Chicago, IL",0,24,,4.0,2015-11-09,"When I arrived there, I thought just another burger chain and it was a busy weekend.  I ordered a teriyaki glaze burger with pineapple, to my surprise, the hamburger was pretty good. I enjoyed it very much with unlimited steak fries.  Price was fair for what I ordered.  I had passed up this place so many times thinking over hyped burgers, but it turned out to be one of my favorites now due to this one burger experience.  There are other burgers on the menu that I will want to try.  My companions had burger, chicken and fish, they also enjoyed them.  Although service was good, the waiter looked tired and bored, just going through the motions, and forgot to give me silverware, so I used the plastic pick that came with the burger to pickup pieces of food. I will go back to Red Robin again hopefully this next time I have silverware :).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-skokie-2?start=120,1.84,2.5,2.5,2.544,2.236

18,AJ K.,"Highland Park, IL",77,185,875.0,3.0,2016-01-03,"Here's what you need to know: This particular location is the least enjoyable Red Robin I've ever been to: it's DIRTY and the service is extremely slow and just plain mediocre. The staff needs a lot of motivation and training. However, the restaurant manager called me, asked me about the issues, listened keenly to my feedback, and vowed to make the problems right. As such, I am upping the rating from 2 stars to 3. We had to move tables because the smell was so pungent and nasty - in one of the 2 main sections of the restaurant (the third section is the bar and I kids are allowed) - that we almost lost our appetite. Thereafter it took our server over 15 minutes to come get our order... all this while our 2 year old was desperate to eat. Finally we order our burgers and drinks, and the food tasted very good (kudos to the kitchen), but the fried egg we requested be added to the sandwich was - not unexpectedly - left off. Moreover, we bought a gift card from the bar, and he transaction was done incorrectly. We ended up waiting for an additional 15 minutes to get that corrected after our meal was done and paid for. To her credit, the bartender/server who made the error was very sweet and apologetic. Overall, I would say that as enjoyable as the food is, I would avoid this location and visit some other RR restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-skokie-2,2.04,2.48,2.48,2.1239999999999997,2.3040000000000003

I went to dinner last night with my friend and his 14 month old daughter. Our server took way too long to come to our table and once she finally arrived she left because she forgot something another table had asked for. She eventually came back and we put our drink orders in (1 water, a kid's juice and a beer). Those took forever to come to our table. She brought the water immediately but forgot about the juice and beer. Once our food arrived we had to ask for ketchup and napkins from the guy who brought the food to the table. Our server came by the table once during our meal so it was hard to ask for more fries since she wasn't around. She was nowhere to be seen during our meal. Food overall was good but wish I was able to enjoy more fries!  To add on to the bad service, my biggest disappointment was the lack of a changing table in the men's restroom. My friend tried to go change his daughter but had to come back to the table and ask me to help him. I had no problem doing it but what would have happened if I wasn't there?!

Our waitress must've been working through a New Year's Eve hangover because she wasn't cognizant of her job expectations. I know waiting tables is not easy, but still...she brought the food out at room temperature, and late. Items kept falling out of her apron. She'd walk past our table, speak to us about our order, and then continue talking as she walked away. She wasn't rude per se, just odd. Furthermore, for as long as we waited for our cool (as in temperature) food, we still had to ask for forks, napkins, etc. Then, she couldn't figure out our bill and even confused ours with another party's. And she only had 3 tables. We sat, and sat....and sat some more... And then came Ron, and he helped us eventhough he wasn't assigned to our table. We even cash tipped him individually because he was awesome. Thank you, Ron! Our waitress, who looked wasted, even watched him bust his hump as he did her job.

31,Lindsey S.,"Chicago, IL",0,14,,2.0,2017-02-12,"The food was between okay and good.  My biggest issue was the service, specifically as it relates to the bottomless fries.  I went on a Saturday around 1:30pm.  It was busy but not full.  There were several empty tables in my section.  The serving of fries I got with my burger was very small.  Maybe 8 french fries.  Our waitress didn't come to check on us for about 10 min.  I tried getting her attention but she didn't look over and I didn't want to yell across the bar area.  I was finally able to order more fries but they took close to another 10 minutes.  I tried to eat my burger slowly to wait for the fries but also didn't want it to get cold.  I ended up finishing my burger right when the second round of fries arrived.  I don't understand why it takes so long if they're bottomless.  Shouldn't they be making fries on a regular basis rather than to order?  Bottomless is pointless if it takes 10-15 minutes to get your next order. We then waited to try to get a check.  We finally figured out, when we saw another table use it, that we could pay our bill on our own at this little computer at the table.  That would have been nice to know.  We thought it was just a menu and games so we set it off to the side. There are much better places to get burgers.  The fries may not be bottomless but you get enough that you won't need more.   The one thing I like is that the menu shows what you can substitute, if the sub is extra, and if the sub is bottomless.  I also like the page of the menu that shows ways to make your meal a little healthier. Our waitress was nice but it seemed like she was assigned to the entire bar area.  No one was helping her by refilling drinks, etc.  It seems a manager could go around the entire restaurant refilling fries, drinks, etc.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-skokie-2?start=40,2.12,2.29,2.29,2.248,2.2220000000000004

I ordered the Smoke & Pepper angus burger on a ciabatta bun w/cheddar cheese, bacon & bbque sauce.  The angus burger cooked medium rare the way I like my meat.  It was exquisite, great quality meat blended with cheddar (because everything is better w/cheddar)  bacon & bbque sauce.  The ciabatta bun gave the burger the slightly chewy texture that I really like.   My wife ordered a basic Red Robin burger cooked medium and that in itself took out a lot of the flavor in what I consider an over cooked burger (NEVER OVER COOK YOUR MEAT).  Both burgers came with unlimited steak fries, but for me it's not a huge selling point because I don't eat fries very often.  Still it is a nice selling feature Red Robin holds its burger ingredients to very strict standards; the beef is always fresh and never frozen, all-natural, domestic, and free of preservatives and added ingredients; and the produce is GMO-free.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-skokie-2,2.36,2.27,2.27,2.448,2.306

The unlimited fries are a big draw, too. The service has been good at this location, even though we usually come on Saturday nights when they are packed. The last time I came however, I had an all-around terrible experience that really soured me on this location. With our one-year-old in tow, my wife and I were seated relatively quickly, but there was a bitterly cold draft emanating from the ceiling above us  We asked no less than four times--the hostess twice and our server twice--to get it turned down or reseat us. Nothing changed throughout the course of the meal, despite the waitress' insistence that she was doing something about it. In addition, we don't really see our waitress much once the food arrived, so I spent most of my meal with an empty Come and the unlimited fries are decidedly more limited when no one shows up to refill them. Thankfully another server took pity on me and made it happen. Beyond the service, the restaurant was filthy. There was salt from a giant pretzel all over the floor under our table. As we were leaving, my wife noticed broken glass mixed in to the mess under our table as well. Before leaving, I went to the men's room  On my way in, I noted a giant pile and trail of salt or sugar on the floor leading to the men's room. Yum! My final experience took the cake though. As I stood at the urinal, an employee--who had delivered our food--emerged from the stall, walked to the sink, quickly rinsed his hands without using soap, and left. I talked to the manager after this because I couldn't take it anymore and she said that I should have told her what was going on during our meal, not afterward. She also thankfully asked me to point out the guy with the potty hands. She gave me a coupon for a free appetizer, but I'm pretty sure I won't be using it at this location.

Convenient location.  The Skokie restaurant is in a strip mall just around the corner from a multiplex cinema and has ample parking. 2. Extensive menu.  The burger selection features a mind-boggling array of combos and toppings, but the menu also offers other sandwiches and wraps, apps, entrées, and entrée-size salads.  Our faves include the Shrimp & Cod Duo and the BBQ Chicken Wrap. 3.  Service.  Consistently friendly and considerate.  Due to the enormity of menu options, mistakes happen.  On our most recent visit, the kitchen botched a sandwich.  While it was being remade (and without our asking or complaining), the server whisked a plate of fries to our table and then the manager stopped by to apologize.  She also comped the sandwich. 4. Walls.  That's right, this restaurant is divided into 3 rooms:  Families with children, teens and millennials, and the 21+ bar crowd.  Brilliant!  I sure wish more restaurants would do this. 5.  Bottomless fries.  'Nuff said. 6.  Red Robin Royalty. This is one of the better incentive programs out there.  You get a free Gourmet Burger during your birthday month, and freebies and discounts by email all year long.  The cost to sign up is free. 7.  Ziosk.  The interactive touchscreens found on each table are fun.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-skokie-2,2.56,2.23,2.23,,2.362

The fries are also awesome but will be better if you get the campfire sauce. As for this location, I've never had issues with the service. Everyone's always nice!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-skokie-2,2.6,2.25,2.25,,2.39
