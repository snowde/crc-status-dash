Is it a chain? Yes. Is it the best-est burger you've evar had!!!1? Probably not. Â But they are really darn consistent when it comes to providing you with just what you like, complete with bottomless fries and a friendly waitperson.  Also, the Red Robin Rewards program is pretty darn good if you come here a few times a year. Plus: Free Birthday Burger!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-smyrna,,,,,
