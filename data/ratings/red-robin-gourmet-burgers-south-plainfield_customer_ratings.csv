94,Erica L.,"Manhattan, NY",193,184,975.0,5.0,2012-03-31,"I LOVE RED ROBIN. I don't care that it is a chain; it is delicious. It is one thing that I really wish New York City had, so I wouldn't have to wait to go home to New Jersey just to have it again. When I was in college and visited my friends at Rutgers, we would always go to Red Robin. It would instantly put me in a good mood. I'm getting excited just writing this review.  In addition to a burger, you must always get a freckled lemonade and garlic parm fries. They are both BOTTOMLESS. The freckled lemonade comes with strawberries in it, and it is the perfect combo of sweet and tangy. The garlic parm fries are big steak fries stuffed with potatoes and topped with shredded parmesan and drizzled with garlicky goodness. I came here with my best friend for the first time several years ago. We both wanted freckled lemonade but figured that we would share one since it was bottomless. The waiter was so nice and just brought us out two freckled lemonades but only charged us for one, which was so thoughtful and actually makes a lot of sense. This would prevent him from having to refill our glasses more often. We tried to do this in future visits, but the waiters refused and were actually confused. If only we had that waiter that first time ... My favorite burger is the whiskey river bbq burger: whiskey river bbq sauce, cheddar cheese, cripsy onion straws, lettuce, and mayo. It is always cooked to perfection and is oozing with flavor. The crispy onion straws give it texture, and the the barbecue sauce just adds the icing to the cake. It is a safe choice for a yummy meal. I have a tried a few of the others as well: - the sauteed shroom burger (sauteed mushrooms, garlic parmesan butter, melted swiss): pretty standard burger. No complaints here. - A.1. peppercorn burger (applewood smoked bacon, melted pepper-jack cheese, A.1. peppercorn spread, crispy onion straws on an onion bun): very flavorful. I was surprised how tasty this actually was. - royal red robin burger (applewood smoked bacon, american cheese, lettuce, mayo, and a fried egg): surprisingly disappointing considering it features the name of the restaurant, so it should be a classic burger that everyone would enjoy. I love fried eggs and adding them to sandwiches, but this burger actually tasted like something you could get at any boring burger joint. I was not impressed at all. I often see other tables order the towering onion rings and long to order it as well, but I know it would be way too much food. I want to try everything on the menu because it looks and sounds so good (whoever does the photography for their menus does an excellent job because the pictures of the food all make me salivate), but I need to have my burger, fries, and freckled lemonade every time. The only complaint I have is that when it is busy (which is often), the service can be somewhat slow. I always leave here with food coma, but at least my tummy is super satisfied. Prices are reasonable, and that's why I come here time and time again. I cannot use enough superlatives to describe Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-south-plainfield?start=60,3.3800000000000003,3.3800000000000003,3.3800000000000003,3.3800000000000003,3.380000000000001

Every burger comes with bottomless fries but they are kind of bland and unremarkable so I've never ordered more and they are the thick steak fries that I've never been a fan of. they just scream ""Eat as much as you can we are just filler"".

102,Jessica H.,"East Brunswick, NJ",205,384,1.0,4.0,2012-07-14,"Red Robin is a favorite among my friends.  It's more than just a burger joint- they always have new items such as fried jalapeno coins (delicious!) and balsamic cream sauce.  I've enjoyed their burgers, onion rings and chicken sandwiches.  The last time I went, it took a long time to get our food even though it was on the emptier side, but our waitress was very attentive and friendly.  I still want to try their newest milkshakes and list of fun cocktails.  I'll continue to go back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-south-plainfield?start=100,3.152,3.152,3.152,3.152,3.152

Everybody was happy with the burgers and the most important one my daughter was happy with her burger and pickles so that was a good thing so far.

96,Kevin H.,"Union, NJ",13,84,28.0,3.0,2013-01-25,"Imo, it's a decent burger place if it's fast food and no waitresses.  Because it's a sit down place, I thought the price were a bit high for just better dressed Johnny Rocket burgers.  A lot of burgers are just too much addons and not much flavor in the patty. As a purist I prefer a nice medium-well patty slightly pink, smoke flavored, and a nice burger sauce.  Toasted buns.  Their patty was just ok, very greasy not juicy enough because they cook them well done.

104,Arielle M.,"Hackettstown, NJ",15,52,,4.0,2013-03-04,"Unlimited fries is a dangerous thing. My boyfriend's got a real love affair with Red Robin restaurants that started long before I ever met him.  When he found out there was one within 15 minutes of us, we headed there right away.  The restaurant is usually crowded for dinner, especially when you go on a weekend.  This past Friday we were seated at a table that shared a wall with the bar, sandwiched between two large tables with kids--one of which had calm, behaving kids, and the other had screamers who darted between the table and the small video arcade at the front of the restaurant. In addition to this noise, the bar's ice-crushing margarita machine was right behind my head, giving me a headache and making it impossible to have a conversation. This is definitely not the place for a conventional date night. But I really can't complain for the tasty, relatively cheap burgers you get here.  There's such a variety that I'm sure you'll find something to fit your taste.  I like the Bleu Ribbon Burger, which has steak sauce and bleu cheese crumbles, and my boyfriend satisfied his RR craving with a Banzai Burger, which has pineapple slices and teriyaki sauce.  There are other options besides burgers, but just like you don't go to a seafood restaurant and order the chicken, you don't come to Red Robin for their salads.  Each burger comes with unlimited French fries, seasoned with their spicy ""Cajun"" seasoning.  We each got two orders of fries and felt like they had to roll us out of the restaurant, Violet Beauregard-style.  BF's a fan of their onion ring tower with the three different dipping sauces, and it's fun and kitschy, but I don't think their onion rings are anything to write home about, and if I'm getting another deep-fried side dish for free (the unlimited fries), I don't see ordering something extra as well. This place only gets a star off because of the noise level (which is understandable since it's a family restaurant, but I couldn't even hear myself think).  Red Robin definitely satisfies burger cravings but good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-south-plainfield?start=100,3.8,3.8,3.8,2.8960000000000004,3.8

120,Rose C.,"Manhattan, NY",21,98,1.0,2.0,2013-05-02,"My introduction to Red Robin came in Southern California and I was very pleasantly surprised. I used to have abhorrence for all things chain restaurant but Red Robin provided a delectable meal and that's the truth. I became hooked on the Bleu Cheese burger, the perfect combination of succulent charbroiled meat and zesty cheese. Oh my God, don't get me started - it was that good. So we checked out this Red Robin on impulse. My spouse had the Prime Chophouse and wasn't as into it as I expected, said mine was better (of course, I ordered the Bleu again). The fries are good and crispy and you can't lose with them being bottomless. I thought $2.99 was too expensive for a small kid's milkshake (and it was quite small) but aside from that, I think their menu prices are fair. The problem is this particular Red Robin really fell short in the service department. We stood around waiting for a table for almost 15 minutes while the majority of the place was empty, literally empty tables all around. Also, we requested a booth and were told we could not have one because that waitress would be leaving soon. What difference does it make? The booth we wanted was literally 10 feet away from where we wound up sitting. Go figure. Then it took a very long while to take our orders and then an even longer while to get our food. Once the food arrived, we realized we had not been given any napkins or silverware (we had ordered sides of cole slaw, etc. so we needed forks). We sat there unnoticed until I got up to speak to someone who happened by (she didn't look too happy either). I asked for water and the waitress brought me just that - one water. Seemed to me that she should have just brought waters for the three of us, but ok, fine. Our waitress was a young, blonde girl and it didn't seem like she was new. Then when we asked for additional sodas (right after we ordered dessert for everyone), she brought us new sodas but left the old empty glasses sitting there crowding up the table. This just seemed very unprofessional to me. I got fed up and grabbed the dirty glasses and just stuck them on a nearby table. Whatever. I could understand if the place was packed but it wasn't. So I'm giving this Red Robin experience two stars even though I love their food. The service was so poor it came very close to ruining the meal even with that incredible chocolate cake with the vanilla icecream and strawberry syrup and that's saying a lot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-south-plainfield?start=120,3.72,3.72,3.72,2.6000000000000005,3.7200000000000006

We waited, someone asked if we were being helped, after I said no he said ok let me get someone. Another 5 minutes goes by. Are you being helped. No. Ok let me get someone. a few minutes later someone finally showed up, walked us to the back and sat us. On that walk there was a table of 3 waiters/waitresses sitting and playing on their phones.

Now for the good - The waitress was friendly, attentive, and made sure that we got to our movie on time, which more than made up for the rudeness of the hostess.  She came to the table multiple times to take orders for the two that arrived later, and to make sure we had enough drinks and fries.  The food was hot and tasty, and came out fast.  No mistakes were made by the waitress or the kitchen, and we were all happy with our meal, plus the pricing is very reasonable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-south-plainfield?start=80,3.16,3.16,3.16,2.7359999999999998,3.1600000000000006

49,Felix S.,"Flushing, NY",220,203,981.0,3.0,2015-04-09,"The only thing you know about Red Robin is their bottomless fries. Burger is not really your thing cause it's too greasy neither are fries. Only reason you go to chain restaurants is because your party is too big for a regular normal restaurant. And you don't want to be a party pooper so you tag along. If you answer YES to the above statements, please proceed ahead- To be quite honest- I'm really not a big fan of burgers and fries- maybe it's because I had a bad food poisoning experience at a burger joint a couple of years back but I think it's mainly because my tummy have PTS and can't handle things that are too greasy (PTS- Princess Tummy Syndrome) so when my church decided to head over to Red Robin for lunch, I so wanted to say NO I'm not going (again PTS kicked in hard) but in the end I decided to join. Really the only thing I know about Red Robin is for their fries and I never though too much about their burgers until this visit in NJ. ( I usually go to the one in Westbury) Our group of about 25 people came on a Sunday afternoon at around 2:00pm and since we had a large party, we waited for about 40 mins to get seated. Decor and Ambiance: very similar to the other Red Robins, sports bar style, you see LCD tv everywhere in the restaurant, there's a big bar right in the front along with some arcade machines for the kids.  Restaurant is filled with many sport memorabilia and pictures of famous sports players.  Very casual and loud but nothing crazy that you can't hear the person next to you. However, cleanness is questionable as the floor was a bit sticky and the bathroom definitely needed some cleaning.  Restaurant seating are mostly booth with some high tables by the sports bar.  Very spacious and the place can easily accommodate 100+ people.  I think Red Robin really upped their game since my last visit because I do not remember seeing so many gourmet burgers the last time I was around.  There are so many choices on the menu that I don't know where to start. Actually I do know since I'm such a big egg head, the one burger that caught my attention right away is the Royal Red Robin (BLT cheeseburger with an egg on top), who wouldn't like that??  There were so many options to choose from but in the end, my favorites are: Towering Onion Rings- Served with Campfire sauce and ranch dressing. Onion Rings are really nothing extraordinary but these are GOOD, FRESHLY GOOD! Definitely made to order because I burnt my lips biting into one of these things! They are crispy and crunchy on the outside and onion is soft on the inside (unlike some places where their onion is still hard and un-chewable), fried to golden brown and the campfire sauce (kinda taste like chipotle sauce) was a great compliment to the onion rings.  The presentation reminded us why we don't play ring toss with our food (had a few onion rings causalities)  Royal Red Robin- Of course I have to go there, I said it before and I'll say it again: EGG MAKES EVERYTHING BETTER! To my surprise, the burger was perfectly cooked, medium, juice blasting and flavorful just the way I like it, bacon was well executed, crispy yet still have some chewiness to it but the EGG was money, it is the binder of it all, what a beautiful sight to watch as the yolk slowly infuses the burger with it's juicy, creamy goodness. Your first bite was WOA, flavor texture overload! You got the juicy burger, crunch from bacon, coolness from the lettuce and tomato and finish it off with the creaminess of the yolk... DANG EXCELLENT and DELICIOUS!! MUST TRY!! Chili Chili Cheeseburger-  If you don't the mess and are into super big flavor then you can't go wrong with the Chili Chili Cheeseburger.  Cheeseburger with double chili on top, yes it's going to be messy but dang it's so flavorful, kinda makes you question how much beef do you need in a cheeseburger but whatever! You have the cheeseburger, topped with Chili- not too salty, got a good kick in the end with bits and pieces of raw onion plus the chipotle sauce.  What more do you want on your burger? DEFINITELY MUST TRY! Service: Decent service, the bottomless fries came out pretty slow and at the end, we were only able to get about 2 rounds of fries but our server was friendly and on top of things! Price: Average: Most gourmet burgers will run you around $10- $12 dollar plus drink you are looking at around $15 for a complete meal but it's pretty good consider their burgers definitely hit the spot and you might even get two meal out of it (remember bottomless fries). Overall: I had a much better experience at Red Robin this time around, the food was fresh and delicious, service was good and price was reasonable.  They definitely upped their game since the last time I was here and if you haven't been to Red Robin for a while, now it's a good time to give it another shot!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-south-plainfield?start=20,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.444,3.0000000000000004

44,Bill M.,"Highland Park, NJ",185,110,82.0,1.0,2015-06-22,"I came here for dinner with my gf who had a gift card that was credited to her as a result of previously poor service. I believe in 2nd food chances and I really like burgers from Red Robin so I was hopeful that our local iteration could redeem itself. If they could even be half as good as the fantastic Hershey, Penna Red Robin, I would have been pleased.  After eating here yesterday, I'm shocked that this particular Red Robin is still in business.  The first issue I had with this Red Robin smacked me right in the face when I walked in. There wasn't a hostess. We were milling around for 5 mins before someone came out and offered us a table. There were plenty of servers and even the manager was there. It was Sunday ~6pm. There is no reason to have the front of the place totally unmanned.  Then I sit down in a greasy sticky table. There were plenty of open seats. I don't know why the hostess decided I needed to sit in the dirty booth.  Our waitress came over and took our drink order and our food order without a hitch. Unfortunately after that,  things really went off the rails. I checked in to Red Robin as soon as I got seated. I took a screen shot of my check in while I was sitting there, without food 45 minutes later. It took over an hour for the waitress to come back and tell us that our food would be out shortly.  Eventually the food came out, delivered by another staff member. This is fine but the waitress should really come over and check on us when the food comes out. My fries were cold. Maybe they were waiting over an hour for my cheeseburger as well.  Also, I ordered my burger well done. If my burger were a new born it would have been a girl, because it was pink! Is it really that hard to cook and serve burgers and fries? Red Robin isn't a place that I'm accustomed to waiting a long time for food to come out. The entire menu is burgers and fries.  There is no earthly reason there should be over an hour wait sitting for food at your table.  The icing on the cake was that our waitress didn't check on us until I finished my food. No refills at all. What a shame, since Red Robin can be great if it is run by someone who knows how to run a restaurant.  Luckily there are plenty of other better burger options virtually right next door. Smashburger and Five guys are better tasting, cheaper, and faster and both down the street.

You can place an order off the online menu (includes pictures), request your server, play games, AND pay your bill. At chains like Red Robin,  I always find myself waiting around to place an additional order or to get my waiter to bring my check... So this feature is a dream come true!! You can even split your bill based on specific items right on the tablet, which is great for large parties.  I ordered a Banzai Burger and subbed the classic steak fries for the garlic herb fries (an extra .99). I've ordered a Banzai Burger at other Red Robin locations and I liked it better elsewhere. My burger was slightly overcooked and could have used more teriyaki sauce. However, I definitely recommend the Banzai Burger if you're dining at Red Robin. Your life will be changed after trying pineapple on your burger! The garlic herb fries weren't amazing, BUT the extra flavor was definitely worth the money. The location was super clean, and as always.. I love the Red Robin décor!  My boyfriend and I only paid about $25 for two burgers AND bottomless garlic herb fries.

28,Pete C.,"Piscataway Township, NJ",0,32,7.0,1.0,2016-01-21,"When they first opened 5yrs ago it was a good addition to the neighborhood.  There were some kinks in the service but they were new and we kept going back.  Over the past few years the menu has changed and the prices have nearly doubled.  And while their burgers still come with bottomless fries, the introduction (a few years ago) of the silver ring to hold the fries cut the original fry serving that comes with your burger in half.   So the $6-$7 burger that is now $10-$15 comes with less and the service is now being replaced with Electronic Tablets at the table.  Not to mention they don't put silverware or napkins at the table (last 5 visits its been the same this is not isolated) so you usually get your food and then have to catch a bus boy or someone to get forks and napkins which they will slap on your table in a pile and you can hand them out yourself. So now Red Robin wants you to place your own order, flag someone down for the essential napkins and cutlery, if you have any leftovers you will again have to flag someone down and box it up yourself, then you check out with your credit card and if you're lucky enough to even catch the name of the person that delivered your food, you're encouraged to tip 20% when you finalize your bill using the touch pad. Let's review that - you are placing your own order, there is no napkins or silverware on your table or delivered with your food, you are boxing up your own leftovers, then you are closing your order when you finish eating.  What is the wait staff doing?  And are they still only being paid waiters wages?   After swiping your credit card, there is a tip screen with a slider that defaults to 20% of the total bill.  That's 20% of the bill after tax not before tax. Seriously?  I am very generous tipper and I eat out all the time.  But what Red Robin is essentially doing is removing any personal service that you would receive when you go to a restaurant, charging a generous amount for the food and then expecting you to leave a gratuity for the service that they removed?  FAIL You got my last $100 meal for onion rings, burger with fries and softdrinks.  Call me stupid for hanging in this long but the next time the kids ask to go to red robin we'll go somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-south-plainfield?start=40,2.8,2.8,2.8,2.404,2.8

It was pretty quiet tonight so my family and I didn't have to use it for that but it was great for paying when we were all finished, and the receipt even prints out the bottom right in front of you! Fast and easy so I liked it a lot.  Anywho, for appetizers I got a cup of the chicken tortilla soup and it was DELICIOUS. Nice and warm, and had so much flavor. Usually when I get this at restaurants it's too salty but this one was great. I wish I had ordered more. We also got the smaller onion ring tower, which comes with 6 large pieces and is great to share amongst two or three people. The dipping sauces are awesome. My dad got some southwest wrap and he said he liked it a lot but I didn't try it. I did try my mom's bruschetta chicken sandwich on ciabatta, which had a lot of flavor in just the one bite I took of it. I ordered their new southwest sombrero salad which was pretty good.

My friend had a tavern burger, but the larger one. I had the Ghost Pepper burger and added an egg. They were average. I've also had the Ghost Pepper burger at Quakersteak and while I like Quakersteak's food better, I liked the Ghost Pepper burger better at Red Robin because it was spicier. We also had Nachos. They were alright, but not worth the $9 price tag. The burgers were too small for the price. A few weeks ago they had a deal where it was two burgers (limited to certain burgers) and a small appetizer for $15. Upgrade to a full appetizer for like $2 more or something. That would have been a good deal. They have bottomless fries, but the amount they give you per serving is too small. You're done in a few minutes and need to ask for more, only the waitress is nowhere around. Service was poor. The waitress did not ask if we needed any drink refills. There's a tablet computer on the table which we could order from, call the waitress and pay our bill. When we first sat down the waitress said ""Oh you can order Nachos in the tablet"" and she went ahead and did it for us, but the rest of the tablet was not explained to us.

I never would have returned if not for coworkers taking me there. One ordered a fancy limited time burger that was so bad he only ate a bite.

Good came out really fast and fresh. Even though there was a mistake with my fries (I ordered sweet potato and they brought out steak fries), they fixed the mistake with absolutely no headache at all. She showed us the suggestions to entertain the 3 year old we were dining with. The location had chalk boards on the wall that you can take to your table and draw on. Hailey took the time to teach us how to use the pay machine on the table which was a super fast way to pay.

But the good taste does not justify the HUGE PLASTIC CONTAINERS they give you for takeout orders. The red plastic box containing my burger was the biggest container I'd ever seen, easily enough to fit a layer cake. Within it was a smaller plastic container with my broccoli inside. The amount of plastic used prevented me from enjoying my lunch. Please take a cue from Panera or Chipotle and use sensible, recyclable packaging.

She recommended the bottomless fries and my friend and I got milkshakes to match. The service was impeccable and the food was given to us very quickly.

Burned to a crisp. Not what I asked for and I am far from picky. My food was burned so bad I couldn't even eat it. I dissected it just for fun instead.  I mean does this look like a medium burger to you? Should we talk about the burned cheese fries? Or nah? I mean really? Even the bun is burned. Nothing about this has been a good experience, except the staff being nice. It used to be one of my favorite places. Now it is a place to avoid. HORRIBLE food. The staff is super friendly & always work hard. Maybe if they were paid a liveable wage, (so typical of large chain establishments), the food would be better.

Last night's visit proved to be a dining debacle of epic proportions. Our 15-minute wait after giving our name to the hostess confirmed a sad fact: understaffed and ill-prepared for the holiday shopping dinner onslaught, confirmed by all the empty tables when we were seated. Burgers were dry, overdressed and falling apart, and for a burger that has a starting price tag of roughly $9, unacceptable. Our full view into the kitchen where we were seated showed a filthy mess of overflowing garbage and debris all over the floor. The capper was an erroneous charge on the bill for something we didn't have, which due to the fact that they were understaffed, added an additional 20 minutes to our ""experience"" until it was finally rectified. Shame...I used to love their burgers.
