132,Kevin O.,"Surprise, AZ",48,227,390.0,2.0,2012-02-26,"Well...I just paid a little over $27 for two sandwiches that just may have been the worst burgers I've ever had in my 32 years.  After seeing the promo pictures for the ""Big Bacon Burger"" I figured I was in for a delicious meal!  Perhaps it is just me, but when I spend $10 for a low quality beef, burger and only taste BBQ sauce, I'm left a bit one on the unhappy side.  I could have spent 1/10 of the money and been more satisfied at McDonald's.  I'm not sure I have to mention the annoying service you get, but unless your nation CHAIN has just opened, you don't need to ask if I have ever dinned here before.  I think I can figure out how a lazy, uninspired burger joint works on my own.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-surprise?start=100,2.7600000000000007,2.7600000000000007,2.7600000000000007,2.7600000000000007,2.7600000000000007

The food isn't above average or really anything to write home about.  The service is a big deal for me and I was impressed with the service.  Our waitress and two others were very friendly and actually kept us giggling through out the meal.

We waited about 20 mins or so.  The server was pretty good, but swamped but made every effort to get us what we needed quickly :)  I didn't realize fries were basically unlimited when we ordered a basket of fries and he kept apologizing that he couldn't get us them, and I couldn't understand why until someone told me haha. Any how the burger I got, the Big Melt Bacon burger, was pretty good but not as tender as I would have liked.  It was a bit overcooked but still decent.   The tower of onion rings is always great and we had strawberry lemonade that had a bunch of real strawberries in it!  It was soooo good with unlimited refills, they even made us a take home cup so we could have more on the way home!  Well worth the money to get that lemonade!

Sure the burgers, fries and whatever are tasty but this is 2012. Once McDonald's starts a healthy menu that is a good sign you should too. On a rare occasion I am fine with pigging out and eating 3500 calories. But this place does not give you an option. Your only choice is to enjoy a meal and take a year off your life. The Red Robin I went to had very friendly staff, they even made the kids balloons. However on a corporate level you have to take some responsibility and either change out the tables for treadmills you can sprint on while you eat or add a healthy menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-surprise?start=100,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006,2.6640000000000006
131,Mia G.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,6,,4.0,2012-06-19,"We've had few issues at this location 1. We were looking for late night food. Online, the hours were listed until 12a, the door said 11p. I wrote an e-mail to the manager, who offered free food, that I didn't take him up on, but they did correct the door to 12a, which we noted on our next visit. I really wasn't complaining for free food, I just wanted the issue fixed.  2. One time (out of at least a dozen we've been) around 10pm, we waited at least 15 minutes to have a waiter come to our table. We finally got a manger who immediately brought out an appetizer and put a discount on our bill for the issue. Beyond that, everything has been spectacular. My son loves going for balloons. The food is decent, hot and as pictured. We love the unlimited refills on root beer floats.

The prices keep going up (Whiskey River Burger is now $9.59), the burgers get smaller and the food gets worse.  I can't say the burger is bad it just isn't good. It is mediocre at best and they charge $10 for it. Personally I think it is insane for what they offer. I would rather have a $6 burger at Carls Jr or better yet - and by far - go to Five Guys and get a great burger that makes this place look like McDonalds.  Unless someone drags me here - last time.

81,George F.,"Surprise, AZ",4,11,3.0,3.0,2013-08-05,"We eat at Red Robin at least 12 times per year - and celebrate every birthday in my 7 person family here as well. Personally, I LOVE RR burgers. The food is always excellent - never a complaint from me. I have to say that in all the years I've been eating at RR (in Massachusetts and the last 2 years in Surprise) I cannot understand why the prices keep increasing and the portions seem to be dwindling. Probably the most obvious is this silly ""Gladiator Cuff) that they just started using for the fries... it hold about 15 fries and is a perfect way to make it so that you get less. The Surprise location seems to have an incredible employee turn-over. When we live in MA, we had the same server for almost 1-year. Here in Surprise, we have had a different server every time we've gone. The service struggles desperately at the Surprise location. We always visit with 7-8 people in our party, and that in-itself is an undertaking for any server, I know. But I'm constantly amazed at how many times we have to ask for refills, or ask for more baskets of fries, or long waits for shakes, or long waits for napkins. Two months ago, our server was so bad that I had to complain to the manager that we had been seated for 45 mins and hadn't received our meals - he then took on the role of our server. It really is kind of sad when we all say ""Let's go to Red Robin"" and the conversation then goes into the bad service experiences we've had in the past 2-years. I hope they get a handle on this because we really are loyal customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-surprise?start=80,2.476,2.476,2.476,2.476,2.476

122,Marylou J.,"Surprise, AZ",1,31,6.0,5.0,2014-02-23,"My Mom, BF and I went to Red Robin for lunch today.  It is one of our favorite places!  Michael and I usually order the Red Robin Tavern Double - protein style - which means it comes in a lettuce wrap instead of on a bun. He does so because he is a recently diagnosed Diabetic.  I do so because I am newly Gluten Free.       Today, I happened to overhear a customer place an order at the bar for a burger on the Gluten Free bun.  RED ROBIN HAS A GLUTEN FREE BUN???!!! I asked our server, Bree, about this and she said they've had it on their menu for a few months now.  She asked if I wanted her to bring one out to try but I didn't want her to go to any trouble and declined and said that I may try it next visit.  But she brought one out anyway.      It was warm and the small piece I tried was soft and had a wonderful, 'real' bread texture! It was great!!! But, unfortunately, within a few minutes, I started coughing. When she came back to ask what I thought about it, I told her that, as good as it was, I had an allergic reaction. Poor thing had to deal with me coughing as we spoke and she felt terrible.  I told her not to feel bad - that I truly appreciated being able to try the GF bun. She kept apologizing and said she would go back to check the ingredients.        A few minutes later, the manager on duty, Rick - if I remember correctly - showed up at our table.  He said he heard about my allergic reaction and wanted to make sure I was okay and didn't need any medical attention. He told us that he checked the box the bun came in and did not see any wheat on it. We assured him that I was fine.       Bree stopped by again and said the only thing she could think of was that she didn't call out 'ALLERGY ALERT' when she ordered the bun and that the cook would not have changed gloves as he would have if she did announce that first.  Again, we told her not to stress about this. But that maybe we'll try it again, on the side, next visit and to remind our server to call out 'ALLERGY ALERT'.  Can I be that sensitive?    My point is, my allergic reaction aside, we had a great experience at Red Robin.

However, the company recently decided to do a calm renovation with color changes, seating updates, and new pictures on the wall, etc. Someone decided it was a good idea to pile eight to ten good sized tables in an area entirely too small for this endeavor. Red Robin has perfected the art of herding cattle. Their customers are moved in like cattle and are as close to one another as possible without actually having someone sitting on a stranger's lap. From the moment you order, until you pay your bill, someone is bumping into your chair and knocking that gourmet burger out of your hands. The waitstaff is either bumping into your table or apologizing for doing it earlier. Seriously? I get they need to make money but would two less tables kill you?

Pretzel Bites-  Eh...they were ok.  They were only $5.00, so the price was right.  They give you about 15 small pretzel nuggets and a little shot glass full of cheese.  The pretzels were nice and hot, but they were a bit wet, and the salt didn't really stick to the bites.  The beer cheese was tasty.  They were alright but I don't think I would get them again. Patty Melt-  This was good!  It was cooked a perfect medium, had a nice amount of onions and cheese and it was placed between some marbled rye bread.  It was a tad small, but still filled me up. Fries-  They provide you with all you can eat fries.  They are thick cut steak fries and come with some magic dust seasoning.  They were alright.  My son mowed down a bunch of fries.  That doesn't say much though as far as the quality since he will pretty much enjoy ANY french fry you give him. Service was just ok.  Friendly at first, but then lacking throughout the meal.  Our waitress did acquire a large party about midway through our meal, so she was tending to them most of the time.  We did have to ask another waitress for a refill on soda and for more fries since our waitress was busy.   Total for everything with tax and tip was $40.00!  A little bit high if you ask me.  The burgers were good, but not $40.00 good. They do have a cool tablet on your table where you can pay for your bill.  We used that, and were on our way.  We passed a bunch of people on the way out of the restaurant and nobody thanked us for coming in or wished us a good rest of our day.  Not too big of a deal, but some smiles or acknowledgement would have made me feel better as we were walking out.  Not too sure how soon we will be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-surprise,2.72,2.72,2.72,2.604,2.72

Our server was right there to take our drink orders and she returned in a few minutes with them. Gave us enough time to decide on what we wanted and if I was given anymore time, I would have changed my mind again. I think between our drinks getting there until us ordering our food, I changed what I wanted to eat 4 or 5 different times. I decided on the fish sandwich. The sandwich was ok, but the great thing is the endless fries.

When waiter came he said that's what I ordered, I said no, my husband ordered for me and I heard him say Royal Red Robin burger! The waiter seemed annoyed, never apologized but said he would put in replacement order! Okay I'm waiting even longer now!!! When it came, I tried to cut it in half to pick it up and the bun fell apart everywhere! He never asked me how I wanted the egg cooked, it was sunny side up and the white was not done! It spilled out and made the bottom bun soggy, never have I eaten a hamburger with knife and fork but I was forced too! The burger had no seasoning and a half slice o bacon was on one side! Then the tomato was mush! All in all it was bad! Now I have eaten this burger for many years in lots of places and other states even, it was my favourite, but I probably will never go back to this Red Robin again!

Not only is this a ruthless and condescending act on mankind, but this member was not just any member. She was also pregnant. In due time, her fries, as well as her husband's drink was given to us but the apologies that met our ears were nothing compared to what was about to occur.

We were greeted by a fellow nerd who enjoyed PHX Comicon as much as we did, and he hooked us up with the comfy red chair table. I love sitting in those chairs. SBL ordered the fish and chips and I ordered the Southern Comfort burger. I may be making the name of that burger up, but it was so good it was stupid! Was it because we worked so hard and we're thirsty like walking through the Sahara with a Dixie sized cup of water? I'm gonna go with no because everything we ordered was made with love. We also ordered the chips, salsa and guacamole for an appetizer. Super good, but the only thing was it came with like a chip. So for future reference just order the feee extra refill when you put in your initial order. (Then you will have 2 chips, one for you and one to share;) Our service was lovely and our tummies were satisfied. Overall it was a happy dining experience.

These are the 2 reasons for giving only 4 stars,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-surprise?start=20,2.32,2.75,2.75,,2.5780000000000003

10,Stephani P.,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",231,31,15.0,5.0,2017-08-12,We had an absolute wonderful experience. Taylor was so sweet and our server Omar was so amazing! Best server we have had including some up scale restaurants. He took the time to listen to my gluten allergy and helped me make proper choices! They have a dedicated fryer for the gluten free fries only! As well as a fryer dedicated to seafood only. This helps eliminate cross contamination which is super important for me. They have gluten free buns too. I opted for the gluten free bun with the guacamole bacon burger and gluten free fries! Perfect! My husband ordered fish and chips. My 5 year old had mac and cheese and 6 year old son had grilled chicken. We all enjoyed the service and the food! The manager ( I forgot to get his name) was amazing! We will be coming back to this location!  Side note: If you come here with kids not only can you play games on the little screen on the table but you can also have them grab a small chalk board and chalk located towards the restrooms.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-surprise,2.6,2.77,2.77,,2.702
18,Josh N Rebecca R.,"Peoria, AZ",302,24,5.0,5.0,2017-08-13,Omar was amazing today. We always love coming here. But Omar was great. The manager was good watching him work in the kitchen to helping other staff. I also noticed other staff asking others if they needed help. I asked Omar as I was leaving for a to go cup. And he was kind in getting it even though he was busy. As I was waiting for the drink near the bar. I had I think 3 members of the staff ask if I needed anything. Just well ran here. We own our family business Rusk Lock & Key and we know how it is to run a business and a lot of times things are not ran well in the community. And I can say they have a good team here and management.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-surprise,2.64,2.78,2.78,,2.724
5,Juan M.,"Chandler, AZ",1419,1110,17446.0,4.0,2017-08-20,"Huge restaurant with a nice bar that has a lot of drink choices. Menu is expansive. Great choice of appetizers and desserts in addition to their lunch/dinner menu. My favorite burger is the Red Robin Royal as it's a 6 ounce patty topped with cheese, bacon, sunny side up egg, and their special sauce. It's awesome! The fried fish sandwich is one of my go tos as well. The French fries are tasty but I enjoy their onion rings more. Fried pickles as an appetizer is a good way to start your Red Robin experience and the mud pie is a good way to end it. Friendly and fast service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-surprise,2.76,2.81,2.81,,2.79

26,Fuzzy O.,"Peoria, AZ",1,34,,1.0,2017-08-28,"We went here on Friday evening around 5 p.m. There was only a five minute wait. We were seated and after a few minutes the server came over. He had our drinks back in a timely manner. We ordered the boneless chicken wings as an appetizer. Then, our server disappeared... We waited and waited... We even hit the ""Call Server"" button on the kiosk at the table thinking that would help. Nope. Our server finally came over and we placed our orders for two burgers. Someone else delivered the boneless wings. They were overcooked and chewy. Our burgers were OK and the french fries were cold. I had to wait for the ranch I requested. At the end of our meal, we used the kiosk to pay. I needed a box, but the server still didn't come around. He finally came over after we waived at him. Not once did I see a manager.  Overall, this experience was terrible. And, this isn't the first time. As, we sat there waiting... We looked at each other and said, this is why we don't come here... I'm noticing this is a pattern with the Red Robin locations that I visit. With so many restaurant choices out there, they have lost my business. I won't be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-surprise?start=20,2.64,2.76,2.76,,2.712

My previous Red Robin experience in Northridge, CA was not the best (see separate Yelp review). However, this was enjoyable. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is we were not offered more fries. Not that we would have said yes because we could hardly finish our entrees after eating a tall onion ring appetizer. A picture of my plate is provided after I had already eaten a few fries. The meal was delicious. I normally go with a chicken sandwich but selected the cod and sweet potato fries. The restroom was clean and the manager stopped by to check in. Two pluses. We will definitely visit again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-surprise,2.72,2.75,2.75,,2.7380000000000004

She didn't ask if we wanted a refill, which we did, obviously, our server was not very smiling either, it was like she wanted us to eat and get going. And forgot to say at the entrance we were greeted by the manager I guess, and his stained shirt, not a tiny stain, trust me.

14,David B.,"Peoria, AZ",0,2,1.0,1.0,2017-09-19,"The only thing that saved this review was the food. The service is HORRIBLE! We sat down, put in the order for our kids. They got their food quick. Our food on the other hand took over 25 mins - we only ordered 2 burgers with fries.Our kids were done way before us(if you're a parent then you know that ain't good). We never got offered a refill, the waitress was all over the place and had other busboys & busgirls bring us our sides. And the sides took forever to bring over. It took another 15-20 mins just to leave because AGAIN no waitress or manager to be found. I had to ask someone walking by. Side note, the family next to us, originally got sat down in an area with NO WAITER. Like i said, service is HORRIBLE. FOOD - that is the only thing that was good about this place.

35,Cindi H.,"Surprise, AZ",0,5,,1.0,2017-09-29,"The Burgers are fine. It isn't the food why I gave it one star. Here is the reason. I had my two sons with me and my ones son's girl friend with. It was my son's birthday on a Wednesday wanted to stay close to home. Food came out fairly quick. So I finally get the bill and go for the little pay box on the table. OMG I found out I forget my phone the holder has credit card ETC... in it. My son offered his card. I said no I have my checkbook in my purse. I kept hitting the light for the waitress to come back. She was a no show after 20 minutes I left the check on the table and left. About an hour later I get a call from the manager She said "" You left a check"" yes I did. She said ""No Restaurant in Arizona takes checks. I said well I'm new around here so I'll just pay you with a credit card. She told me I had to come down to the restaurant and pay. I said you can't take it over the phone??? Her response was NO because you never know who is listening. I was like you have to be kidding, Im not coming back in tonight. She said well I'll have to call my GM. Seriously you shouldn't be the manager if you can't resolve this.

There's one page roughly on the menu for salad or such. Tonight I ordered the fish and chips, hubby got a burger, my boys had a kids meatball meal and shrimp and chicken. They really have shrunk their plates and offer endless fries etc, but your getting so much less than they use to make for a higher price. The kids meal looked like frozen meat out of a bag and by the end of the meal everyone was still hungry. Our fries were cold. I will say they did bring out more fries that were just cooked and my fish was excellent.
