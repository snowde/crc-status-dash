30,Jeff G.,"Tallahassee, FL",57,42,41.0,3.0,2015-07-02,"I went on the 2nd day that they were open during lunch with some friends. I had the Wiskey River Burger with (no pink as they put it). The burger was very juicy and the bun was toasted. The wiskey BBQ sauce was realy good and the onion straws topped it off. The little container of fries on the plate turned out to be the tipping point between full and stuffed. I did not partake in the bottomless fries or desert, as I could not eat another bite. The food I give 4 stars to but due to the servers being so green and the mass confusion when receiving the orders at the table and paying the bill between seperate checks I give an overall 3 stars. I am SURE this will improve as the servers get more seasoned. I will definately be going back as there is a whole lot more on the menu for me to try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tallahassee?start=40,2.38,2.38,2.38,2.38,2.38
1,Michael B.,"Tallahassee, FL",44,40,233.0,3.0,2015-07-04,"The good: I went during their soft opening when they were providing free lunches. I got the Prime Rib Dip (sandwich) with fries. The sandwich was good. The au jus was good as well. The fries were okay, but putting Red Robin seasoning on them made them quite good. Everybody was very attentive, and the atmosphere was interesting. The negative: Our table was a little two-seater by the bar and in front of the kitchen, so there was a narrow opening between us and the people sitting at the bar that EVERY waiter had to walk through, so it wasn't exactly a relaxing meal. Also, the sandwiches were good, but in a town with so many great sandwich/burger restaurants they weren't anything to write home about. Will I go back? I'm definitely going back at least once to give the Blue Moon shake a try (I was on lunch break), but that's the only thing I think this place has that nearby competition doesn't offer or doesn't do better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tallahassee?start=20,2.348,2.348,2.348,2.348,2.348
64,Melissa H.,"Tallahassee, FL",50,1,,2.0,2015-07-07,"There were several things that we liked about the new RR in Tally, but a pretty significant mishap that led to the lower rating.  We visited for lunch on a Tuesday.   1st- liked the atmosphere and extensive menu.  2nd-Our server was great, very knowledgeable and patient.  3rd- The food was pretty good, I had my go-to burger with avocado and jalapenos, and hubby had his go-to with a fried egg and bacon.   The garlic fries were okay, but I think we'll stick with regular fries if we return.   We did have one problem that I'm still a bit unsettled about.  As the food runner brought our food to the table she splashed the red dipping sauce on the table and on my bran new white blouse (took the tags off this morning).  It was an accident, and the visiting manager came over and was very nice and apologetic; she offered to pay for dry-cleaning. What's not sitting well with us is that when we received our bill, it had a 20% off for my husbands burger(about $2.75), but full price for mine.  Although it was an honest mistake, I do feel it was worthy of some further compensation as I will now have to take time to attempt to get my blouse cleaned and hope that the stain comes out.   I will have to take further time to get compensated back from RR (for cleaning) or discuss the next step if the blouse is ruined.  Bummer that our first experience at a RR ended in this way.  As we have experience in food service, we feel that the meal(at least mine) should have been discounted further or fully for the inconvenience of having to attempt to get the stains from the shirt as well as having to walk around with a stained shirt for the remainder of the work day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tallahassee?start=60,2.216,2.216,2.216,2.216,2.216
31,Brianne T.,"Tallahassee, FL",0,3,,1.0,2015-07-12,Disappointed. The beer was good but it was typical craft beer you would find anywhere. I ordered the Royal Red Robin and asked for some pink. It came out extra well done and my substitutions were wrong. Very disappointed in the flavor and temperature of the burger. The fries were good but very small portion.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tallahassee?start=40,2.084,2.084,2.084,2.084,2.0840000000000005
3,Danielle A.,"Tallahassee, FL",73,19,21.0,4.0,2015-07-15,"I came on a Wednesday at around 5:20pm. I had been advised to go early because it can still get crowded here since it just opened a few weeks ago. It was mostly an old crowd inside and my boyfriend and I did not have to wait to be seated.  The interior is smaller than I expected. We were seated in the area that had a majority of the 2 seat tables at a table where one person would be sitting along a cushioned bench and the other would be sitting at a chair. If you have ever been to Cheesecake Factory, it was similar to their tables that have two sides, one bench and one chairs. My boyfriend felt very uncomfortable and noted that he was so close to the people sitting next to us where he could hear their conversations.  I ordered a bacon cheeseburger and my boyfriend ordered the burger with an egg. They ask you if you want some pink or no pink and we both got some pink. If you order burgers from I believe the classic menu, your fries are bottomless! I got herb parmesan fries and my boyfriend just got plain fries.  Our order came very quickly, maybe 10-15 minutes. They do give you a small amount of fries but, like I said, they are bottomless so you can just keep asking for more. Our burgers were not cooked pink but I don't think it took away from the burger. The burgers were larger than I expected. The only downside was that the egg on my boyfriend's burger was not cooked fully so his stomach was upset after. He was asked if it was ok that the egg was cooked sunny side up and he said fine, but he recalls after eating that there was still some uncooked egg white around his yolk. I enjoyed the herb Parmesan fries and we both asked for more fries after our first plate. Their fries are thick cut steak fries. We also ordered an alcoholic milkshake to share which was fine. Because, like I said, we were so close to our neighbors, I overheard one couple saying they enjoyed a lemon cake they ordered but another couple saying their chocolate cake was not moist and they asked to take it off their bill with no problem.  By 6:15pm we were out of the restaurant. I did notice that there were two tables in my area that were never filled with guests while we were there but as we were leaving the lobby looked crowded, probably with bigger parties than the two people seating area could hold.  There were moments where you could tell the restaurant just opened because there was some confusion from servers at times but it's ok! It should get better, right?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tallahassee?start=20,2.416,2.416,2.416,2.416,2.416

25,Jay W.,"Tallahassee, FL",106,60,13.0,3.0,2015-07-23,"The ""gourmet"" is really what gets me. It's a pretty good burger with a LOT of options, but it's a little on the thin side and the burger cooks haven't quite gotten down what it means to cook ""medium rare"" or even medium well for that matter. That just doesn't get ""gourmet"" for me especially with Vertigo across the street. Nonetheless, not a bad place for a $12 burger, but not the best either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tallahassee?start=40,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998,2.2199999999999998
22,Art W.,"Tallahassee, FL",1,3,,2.0,2015-07-26,"I had the Black and Bleu Turkey Burger with bottomless garlic fries. The burger was ok, but definitely not exceptional. It was for sure a frozen pattie out of a box...again, I buy these at the grocery store, they are fine, not great. I'd only buy a box of these if they were bogo and I had coupons. It was sort of spongy, like the meat was offset with some filler. It was your garden variety mass produced frozen turkey burger. Toppings were fine, tasty, again, not exceptional.  I was expecting a mound of grilled mushrooms and onions...I got a scoopful.  The ciabatta bun is a good idea, but, again, it just wasn't the best ciabatta bread I've tasted. The steak fries are decent, but (notice the theme) not exceptional.  I paid up and got the garlic version...which, for $0.99 extra, got a few dashes of some garlic salt seasoning and a sprinkling of some hard, less than fresh parmesan cheese.  In other words, nothing really special was done for one version vs the other. I've definitely had much better garlic parmesan fries. And, again, it seems like they are out of a bag from the freezer. Nothing special.  I had the American Mule at the bar.  Again, nothing exceptional. Got to the bottom of it and discovered most of whatever syrup was used to sweeten it was still there...as if it wasn't properly shaken in order to well combine all ingredients. Bottom line...nothing exceptional here!  Maybe the angus burgers are great, but I'm not that confident. The boozy shakes sound tempting, and hopefully aren't just overly sweet.  This restaurant suffers from a good idea being mass produced and turned into a chain. If the bread was locally sourced and prepared, the meat was made into patties by hand, and real potatoes were cut into fries, it could rightfully claim to be gourmet. As is, it's all sex appeal with little substance.  That's all many people are looking for, so it might be successful.  I'll only go if dragged in a group. Locally owned restaurants and bars will give you a much better experience!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tallahassee?start=40,2.184,2.184,2.184,2.184,2.184

And Luke warm.  I'm a bit forgiving on (lack of) food temperature when I'm starving, but my companions sent theirs back.  The server was very gracious - we let her know they were over cooked as well.  They came out well done and warmish.  The buns looked as if they had been toasted at some point, but we're cold.  The kitchen staff aren't doing much for the place.  A manager came to check on us and my companions are very polite and we're going to ""deal with it"", so I let him know the kitchen couldn't get the burgers right (that all were well done).  The manager generously offered to give us 50% off - and we let him.  Even though they were wonderful, the food wasn't.  It's been over 10 years since I've eaten at a Red Robin, I was excited to see it open...

28,Dee B.,"Tallahassee, FL",0,8,,2.0,2015-07-31,"I usually give a place three tries before I decide whether I add them to my list.  Red Robin I went twice.  The service was good to exceptional, too bad the food doesn't live up to the hype. I went the second week after grand opening, and was not surprised to have to wait.  I tried the patty melt on my first visit with cole slaw and a chocolate shake.  I hate the idea of paying so much for a burger and not being able to get it the way I like, medium-rare, but settled for the ""little pink"".  Dry, not hot.  Cole slaw was thickly grated cabbage and didn't appeal to me at all.  Unfortunately the chocolate milkshake was just sweet, not very chocolatey. The second visit I was told the wait was 10 minutes ONLY because the staff was changing.  There were MANY empty tables and no one else in the lobby area.  I could accept that and my server was outstanding! I ordered a Smoke and Pepper burger that was so dry, I should have sent it back but I was too hungry.  Soon salty! Could not eat the bun.  I tried the fries, and a short order of the onion rings both as an indulgence.  Both were hot and fresh but the onion rings' batter got old after the third one.  I would not order them again. I may go back the third time just to try something other than their ""gourmet"" burgers.

If you're 21+ you can skip the line and sit at the bar (if it's not a weekend), on the weekend you should expect to wait to get seated.  Friendly staff, if not a little spread thin. Wait time for food is a little long but you could always get an appetizer while you wait. Pretzel bites are delicious and great with a tall glass of beer. They've got limited draft options BUT they have Proof on tap, so props to them for at least trying to support a local business. Looks like they have a full bar so if beer isn't your thing, you could get a Blue Long Island or some other liquory drink. Not sure if they're light or heavy on the pouring though so this might not be a good happy hour spot.

15,Cobra C.,"Goldsboro, NC",2,8,24.0,1.0,2015-08-01,"Tl;dr: steak and shake quality food at gourmet burger price.  Went for lunch not knowing anything more than its directly across from vertigo burgers, so thought it must have some competition going on to pick a spot directly across from a local favorite.   Immediately confronted by milling people with no place to stand, all waiting to get seated, and the entrance being very crowded since there wasn't enough room for the amount of people waiting. There were lots of tables empty, so not sure what the holdup was to get seated. The hostess was giving estimates of 35-40 minutes no matter how small or large the party, lots of groups of twos left even though there was space at the bar and at tables, bc the hostess kept stating the long wait time and the crowd of people with no place to sit.  Our party of 5 was seated in under 20 minutes, but it took almost two hours to finish the meal due to the wait staff and kitchen turnout.   There were a lot of variety to choose from, which was interesting. I chose the original that they stated was what made them famous, and asked for as rare as possible.  The food took over 30 minutes to come out, and burgers were thin and dry and tasted frozen, nothing compared to some of the great local places like vertigo or burgerfi. Lettuces were wilted and not fresh, nothing about the burger had flavor. The fries were from a bag as well, and tasted frozen. Everything tasted like a run of the mill fast food like hardys or steak and shake. Which is ridiculous for the $10 plus price point and extremely slow service.  Wait staff and kitchen were extremely slow and unorganized, many orders going back to the kitchen and waitresses spilling drinks, and dropping food.  My own burger was cooked well done, instead of rare, but it would have been impossible to cook rare since it looked like a thin frozen patty from a box.  Overall an overpriced and extremely disappointed burger place. If you're looking for a good burger, Tallahassee has many more local burger joints that that have quicker and better service, with fresh food that isn't frozen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tallahassee?start=20,2.212,2.212,2.212,2.212,2.212

The first couple of weeks were PACKED, which is what usually happens when something new opens up here. Nowadays, it's much less crowded, depending on the time of day of course. Anyways, I was pleasantly surprised. I was under the impression that this was a regular burger joint. Not at all. Restaurant style with a wide selection of gourmet burgers as well as other things. They a small selections of things like salads, wraps, fish, pasta, etc. I LOVE the pretzel bites with beer cheese and their mozzarella sticks are good too. The burgers are flame broiled I'm guessing from the smokey flavor and they're cooked to order. I enjoy my visit every time. The last time I went the bartender made me the wrong spiked milkshake and I are my whole meal and then didn't want the milkshake. Apparently it was sitting at the bar the entire time.

49,Kevin F.,"Tallahassee, FL",113,360,212.0,3.0,2015-08-11,"Went for a couple of burgers and to check the place out. The restaurant was hectic and when we went in, we stood awkwardly waiting to be addressed by one of the two hostesses as one of them dealt with the only other party waiting at the time, a three top that came in with us. We were finally asked how many in our party, and then asked to have a seat as they got our table ready.  One thing I have a had time with is being seated at a table that is wet from being wiped down. It really ruins the moment. The menus are laid down on the wet surface, you end up resting your hands or arms in it too. When you go to dry the table, you never quite get it off your menus and other items on the table. I wish restaurants would focus as much on delivering a dry table as they do wiping them down.  The server was great. She was very kind and personable. She offered some suggestions and was attentive throughout the meal.  The food was good, but not worthy of the prices listed in the menu. The patties were overcooked, but the food was presented well and was visually appealing.  As the adults had already eaten, we let the kids order from the adult menu so they could try new things. Both said the burgers were good, but they aren't as good as other places in town.  The server only charges us for two drinks, even though we ordered four (guess she gave the kids theirs for free). We had two burgers on the bill as well for a total of $32 and change. Pretty steep! Glad for the experience of trying Red Robin.

The system with the server and the electronic order system is a bit odd. My eleven year old nephew thinks touch screens are the best thing ever so he was thrilled to navigate the system to order our shakes and pretzel bites appetizer. At one point, a server mistakenly delivered a beer to our table. Our entrees arrived before our appetizer. I had asked for the dijon sauce on the side rather than on my burger. Regrettably, that request was not honored. My sweet potato fries, though tasty, were not fully cooked and also almost cold.  My nephew enjoyed the pretzel bites once they finally arrived. I would likely not order them again. My burger was decent. Aidan liked his macaroni and cheese.  Our server was friendly and helpful.  The kitchen issues are another matter altogether.  She mentioned the kitchen being ""backed up"".  Well, if Red Robin cannot handle a rainy Sunday afternoon post church rush woe to them when football season hits. I also was not thrilled with the $1.99 entertainment charge Aidan incurred playing the games on the table console. Really, Red Robin, that sort of charge is really nickel and diming customers.

56,Daniel P.,"Tallahassee, FL",254,714,4083.0,2.0,2015-09-21,"(I had to prune out about 700 characters.  Yelp only allows 5,000 character reviews.  Red Robin - this is a victory for you.  I saved it though. Bottomline:  I didn't know it was going to be this bad.  I should have heeded the warnings of the many yelp reviews preceding this one.  It's not ONE-STAR material overall.  There were some redeeming qualities that brought this up to a two star. (the place was clean, well lit.  there were no broken light bulbs.  no vagrants in the restrooms.  you get the picture). Some reviews are meant to be drafted while still at the scene of the crime.  This is such a review.  Walking in, we instantly knew we were entering what appeared as a  Truck Stop.  Nothing against trucking.  The vast majority of our land-freight is handled by the men and women of this nation's great 18-wheeler sector, and I salute them! However, I can anticipate a truck stop in advance. This was a cheap shot. I'll comment, in chronological order (At this point, I'm no longer there - but in the safety of the New Leaf parking lot while wife gets stuff for kiddo lunch pails tomorrow).  1. Arrived to be greeted by a threesome at the hostess desk.  We were led to table 24. A 4-top with a kindle thingy attached to a base - colorful/shiny stuff on its still-new screen.  No explanation of the kindle thingy (I know I can figure it out - but what if I couldn't?) 2. Server comes.  Somewhat affable yet also unsure all at once.  Prompted us for an appetizer order (way to upsell) and we said ""sure"", ordering cheese sticks and jalapeño fritters of some sort.  Also, the drinks. 3.  We ordered - and after a period of time (in which a single-table and a two-top whose orders were entered after ours received their meals before ours), the platters were delivered.  I ordered one from the top tier of burgers (they admit to having a good, better, best caste system for the burgers.  More like Coach, 3rd Class and Cargo).  Mine was the DBG (or some three letter clever name).  It had arugula, aioli, and sundried tomatoes.  Sounds like it should have been good, right?  Wife/daughter ordered garden burgers.  When I ordered, I asked for it to be ""medium rare"".  After all, this is billed as a ""Gourmet Burgers"" joint.  Well, this ""Gourmet Burgers"" doesn't use the conventional scale from rare-to-well. Instead, our server said ""we can leave SOME pink. By the look of the delivered patty, I wouldn't be surprised if the patties are par-cooked prior to delivery here.  There was the faintest trace of pink in what was billed as a 1/2 lb (pre cooked) burger.  That was not the case.  If an establishment refers to itself as the source of gourmet burgers, it should speak the universal language of carnivores.   3a/4. (Sorry, my numeration here is getting sloppy.  Contagious, it would seem). The plates came - and I recognized there was an abundance of grease in this burger.  Applying light pressure, I estimate I reduced its fighting weight by 25%.  No exaggeration.  Look at the picture once I post it.   4-something... The burger itself had near-zero levels of flavor.  There was a hint of arugula's distinct flavor-presence, but anyone familiar with this leafy goodness knows that it's not shy.  Arugula jumps on scene and is no fly on the wall.  This was a mystery.  There was a ""melange"" of sautéed onions on the burger.  Again - no flavor, just oversauced & over cooked texture.  wife/daughter's garden burgers were mushy and quite over-valued. (OK - I'm now in the comfort of my home office.  this will go faster now.) - p.s., I've hit up against the 5,000 character max, so I had to prune paragraphs out...  final suggestion - because I believe Red Robin wants to do better: 1. the team at this restaurant didn't seem to have any sort of common identity with one another.  no apparent team cohesion.  I suspect this is because of a weak corporate culture.  2. Train your folks to better address the requests for burgers cooked less than well-done.  Having the server say ""we can leave a little pink in there for you"" doesn't sound like a ""Gourmet Burger"" place.  3. There's got to be something you can do to introduce flavor into that D.G.B. burger.  I mean, c'mon now.  That was $13! - It'd be one thing if I were at one of the awesome burger joints in town (Shout out to Wells/Caboose, Vertigo, Merv's, Canopy Road, Jenny's, Gordo's) but it's not.  Those guys know how to put some awesome burgers together (hey, sorry awesome-local-burger-places if I forgot one of you - I'm just trying to help the folks at Red Robin, and I might have inadvertently omitted one of you - sorry).  And, I'm not hating on chains.  Grub,  BurgerFi and Smashburger are great!. Red Robin, I'm not trying to hurt feelings.  I just want you to do better.  And, the good news is that there's nowhere for you (Red Robin) to go, but UP! - So, there's the silver lining!!! (o.k., you ""could"" go down to one-star, but I have confidence in you - and I know you won't let that happen.)

As we walked in it had a very cute design however, the music was blaring loud and they were not that busy to justify such loud music.

We sat there enduring the blasting music and waited for our food.

33,Lee K.,"Tallahassee, FL",0,27,,2.0,2015-09-25,"My wife and I took our daughters to Red Robin last night for dinner.  We were celebrating our older daughter's birthday, and Red Robin was her choice.  When we arrived the restaurant was about 1/3 full, and we were greeted promptly.  After about 10 minutes were were taken to our table, and our waitress arrived to take our drink order.  She was pleasant and helpful, so we were off to a good start.  We also ordered the $7 hummus appetizer with our drinks.   The hummus was average, but what was really strange was the quantity and presentation.  The hummus was served in a wedge of lettuce, with VERY little actual hummus.  It was a very skimpy portion for $7, and I'd recommend that you consider a different appetizer if you eat at this restaurant. We then placed our dinner order:  Two grilled chicken sandwiches, 1 bacon cheese burger, and a soup and salad.  It seemed like it took a long time for our food to arrive, and when it did it was warm at best.  Not cold, but it appears everything had been sitting in the window for a while before delivery to our table.  Of particular concern, the fries were nearly cold and were somewhat hard.  They were well past their prime, and as one of the two things on my plate, they really needed to be great.  My burger was also only warm, and it was overcooked.  As others have stated, a gourmet burger place should be able to offer a medium rare burger, or at least take the Five Guys route and say that all burgers are cooked well done.  Don't ask me how I would like my burger prepared only to deliver a well-done patty. When our waitress returned I mentioned that the fries were cold, and asked to have them replaced.  I told her that we would gladly wait for the kitchen to cook a fresh batch, and that we were more concerned with quality than having the fries delivered quickly.  Shortly thereafter we received three new orders.  One was piping hot, fresh, and delicious.  The other two were old and cold!  We sent them back again and the following refill was great.  Even though the issue was resolved, the kitchen needs better quality control for the food leaving the restaurant. Another oddity is the on-table table / ordering system.  My kids tried to play the games, but first we had to order our drinks and have the system activated.  Then it was going to cost $2 for access to the system.  Not much money, but I found having to pay anything offensive, so we did not play the games. We then tried to order our dessert using the touch pad system because our waitress had disappeared.  We were able to complete the transaction, and when we accessed our bill on the tablet it had been updated to include the cost for our dessert.  But it never came!  When our waitress finally appeared, we asked about our dessert.  She explained that you can order on the tablet, but the system does not alert the kitchen or waitstaff!  That is confusing, and useless.  I will say that the mud pie was the highlight of the meal.  It was pretty darn good. To summarize, Red Robin offers up very average, generic food at an inflated price.  My burger and fries were not bad, but not gourmet or exceptional.  Unfortunately they charge an exceptional price for average food!   I would recommend that others take the advice offered in previous reviews.  Go to a locally owned burger joint like Vertigo Burgers (great!), Voodoo Dog, or even a chain like Grub Burger, Burger Fi, etc.  They offer much better food at a lower cost.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tallahassee?start=40,2.52,2.52,2.52,2.6320000000000006,2.52

Beyond the slow service, the food was excellent as always, which is why I go here.  I was getting a headache from two screaming toddlers/infants, but that is not the fault of Red Robin.  It's a kid friendly environment, and I get it, kids do scream from time to time.  But when you combine the screaming kids with poor service you result in having a higher stress level after you left the restaurant then you did when you entered it.  Again, the kids are not Red Robin's fault, but it didn't help the experience whatsoever.  If we had received better service I wouldn't have cared. I'm on the fence as to whether I return honestly.  The food is great here, but on a Tuesday night your servers need to step up their game or it will cost you business.  And I eat out at least once a week, so take that for what it's worth.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tallahassee?start=20,2.64,2.64,2.64,2.636,2.64

7,Jerry A.,"Tallahassee, FL",0,1,,4.0,2016-12-11,"I think as a burger on it's own, a 3 star might be more appropriate. Meat was good, but nothing special. I had the simple burger ( just the basics) and my husband's was dresses up with cheese, mushrooms etc, that had him giving 4 stars on flavor alone. However, the 4 stars, and maybe even 5 is because as someone who is gluten free I could enjoy myself without having to do without much of what makes going out for a burger fun. Had just been to 2 pizza places that carry gluten free crust, both out at the time. Red Robin was across the street so went in there. Not only could I get a gluten free bun, but a gluten removed beer, and fries, as they have fryer without gluten contaminated items used in it. Fun evening. The waiter was also very helpful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tallahassee?start=20,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005
47,Jennifer I.,"Tallahassee, FL",107,648,62.0,3.0,2016-12-21,"I've had inconsistent experiences at this Red Robin. One time it was great, and the other, not so much. I'll give it 3 stars because my first experience was wonderful, but my most recent one was not. I think the determining factor was the attitude of the waitress. On our most recent visit, one of my friends asked her for a milkshake as dessert, and she told him to place the order himself on the tablet that sits on the table. I don't understand the tablets...are they slowly phasing out waitstaff? Does this upset the waitstaff? Do they take it out on the guests? I used to be a waitress, and am very courteous (please, thank you, if it's not much trouble, etc.) because I know how much it sucks. However, unjustified attitude pisses me off as a guest.  Some general tips: 1) service is slow. Our food took at least 30 minutes to come out. Drinks and milkshakes came out very fast. 2) Bathrooms were not stocked [yikes!] with toilet paper. 3) Waitstaff attitude is everything. Smile. Treat your guests like guests, not burdens. 4) California Chicken sandwich is supposed to have guacamole...where, exactly? It looked as though maybe 1/4 tsp of guacamole was put on my sandwich.  I'm sure we will be back because...well, bottomless steak fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tallahassee,3.08,3.08,3.08,,3.0800000000000005
43,Kimberly A.,"Tallahassee, FL",112,69,402.0,3.0,2016-12-22,"Finally decided to give Red Robin a go with my husband. We've been wanting to try their burgers for years but just never made it in there.  Unfortunately, this was a 2 star meal experience for me. The only reason I am rating 3 stars is because our server was just as sweet as she could be and was very attentive.  When we arrived at 8:30 tonight the restaurant was pretty dead. Only a few tables were sat. We waited for a couple of minutes for the hostess and asked to be seated in a booth. She asked us to give her a few minutes to wipe down a table. I thought this was quite odd considering all tables in the restaurant were empty with the exception of maybe 5.  We were sat in a booth in the bar area and after a couple of minutes we asked to move as there was an air vent blowing directly on us. I like air conditioning like all Floridians but it's December and I'd rather not eat my meal in the path of a wind turbine. We were then placed at one of the high top tables in the bar. Much more comfortable and warm there.  I ordered the A1 Peppercorn burger and my husband chose the Smoke & Pepper burger.  While my husband enjoyed his burger (he'll eat anything folks), I only managed to get down about 1/3 of mine. The flavors were just a complete miss for me. It certainly wasn't the worst burger I've had but considering the prices they charge here, I felt like I was being robbed. The burger itself lacked flavor while the ""crispy onion straws"" were more like a soggy stuck together mess.  I'd be lying if I didn't acknowledge that I had major buyers remorse after spending $38 bucks on two burgers and 2 Cokes.  For me, I'll stick to Burger Fi or the Bj's Brewhouse burger. A much better burger for half the cost.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tallahassee,3.16,3.16,3.16,,3.1600000000000006

M not sure if this is new to RR or she's just goes the extra mile, but I'm giving her credit. Now add in refills without asking. Good conversation. Best RR experience ever. I am long term restaurant manager. So I know the subtle little things that make a difference.

45,Richard A.,"Tallahassee, FL",36,78,27.0,3.0,2017-03-03,"Did take out for lunch for my office so this review speaks more to the take out experience versus eating in, which I have done on a couple of occasions. Had a fairly large order, and was expecting a little delay when I went to pick it up. Nope, it was ready and packaged up perfectly. In fact, everyone's order came out exactly like they wanted. I had the Smoke and Pepper burger, and it was very good. I wanted it pink in the middle and it was perfect. The pepper and bacon really stood out and the sharp cheddar made for a great burger. The fries were great, and that has been my experience dining in as well. To be fair my dine in experiences have been hit or miss for one reason or another, but this trip was good. As far as chain burger places go, this isn't bad, Tallahassee has many better options. That said, I'll likely come back due to convenience if anything, and I will likely be fine with what I get.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tallahassee,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006

The food was good and up to Red Robin standards. But our waiter, Eric, made the trip amazing. He saw that we had a coupon from the birthday club, so he just entered it without being asked. He never required us to ask him to freshen our drinks or to get more of the bottomless fries. He was friendly without hovering or aloof. Easily, it was some of the best service I have ever enjoyed.

This is a good burger chain to go to for kids, and their bottomless drinks are definitely things to check out on the menu. The burgers are decent, but nothing to write home about.

It was gross, drank it anyway. I then Asked for a blend and yes, after 6, asked for another class of regular priced wine. So, yes I'm writing this review with three glasses of wine in me... Anyway, when we went to pay the check there was a charge for 8.99, 4.90, and 3.50. When I asked my server, I was told that the wasn't a house cab, but she thought I really wanted the cab. I was like 'no, it was gross and that's why I asked for a blend the next time.' And added that she should have told me there wasn't a house cab. She said she would send a manager, who seemed nonplussed and who responded 'okay.' I said I only wanted to pay what I thought I was going to pay - 3.50$ for the drink.

6,Melissa W.,"Valdosta, GA",0,20,35.0,2.0,2017-05-30,"Red Robin is one of my all time favorite places. This was not our first trip to this location but might be our last. The food would have been amazing if we would have had a waitress that put it in correctly and knew what she was doing. Not sure what happened but it was the service that made our visit bad. The waitress kept blaming everyone else for the amount of time it took and the wrong items coming out. It took us about 15 minutes or so to get our bar drinks and every 4 minutes she would come by and blame the bartender for the wait. Then the completely wrong burgers came out and she blamed the kitchen. She said she rang the burger in correct but when we received the check, we could clearly see the wrong burger was entered in on the servers end. It just got really annoying after a while. To the point where we were afraid to ask for a box to take the food that did come out right fearing she would take forever and blame the box company for the wait, haha, it was ridiculous. As a matter of fact,  the table that was sat next to us experienced the same issues. I could hear the waitress blaming the kitchen and the bartender for the mess ups at their table as well.  Very dissapointing experience.  We actually went to BJ's Brewhouse later on in the day.

40,Ralph S.,"Miramar Beach, FL",33,342,542.0,3.0,2018-01-12,"This is only my second trip to a Red Robin and the first in about five years. It was a good experience. The burger I ordered was cooked perfectly. Apparently the meal comes with all the french fries one cars to eat. They were good but one serving was plenty. It is also possible to substitute something healthier such as broccoli but, since I was eating a hamburger, fries seemed like the way to go. The decor is attractive, the restaurant is clean and neat and the menu is extensive. As one would expect, hamburgers are the main attraction. There are a variety of options. I felt somewhat guilty getting just a hamburger on a bun with just lettuce and tomato. But the waiter gladly delivered what I ordered and it came quickly. There is also an extensive beer listing and a few fairly inexpensive wine selections. Red Robin is more comfortable than restaurants like McDonalds or Burger King with a greater variety. There is also ""sit-down"" service.  Payment was through a small computer screen at the table. It was convenient and better than waiting for a server to come back to the table when it is very busy.  I spent about 45 minutes in the bar area nursing a glass of red wine and watching a Duke basketball game while waiting to travel to the Tucker Center for the Florida State game with Louisville. The bartender was working hard and there were a number of people eating in the bar. The atmosphere was pleasant, the TV reception was good and the glass of wine was not bad either. Overall, a good experience at the Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tallahassee,3.12,3.12,3.12,,3.1200000000000006
