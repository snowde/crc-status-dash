He said hey we are ordering from Red Robin, what do you want, and before everyone gets happy, the burger did come with a meeting that had to be attended too, haha  So this time I picked the Whiskey River BBQ burger, it had cheddar cheese, onion straws, lettuce, tomatoes and mayo and it was cooked to perfection but it was lacking that whiskey river bbq sauce I was craving, the bbq sauce was the reason why I ordered it :( but overall the burger tasted great. It also came with their french fries and I have to tell yall, those fries are my favorite, man they are soo dang good.

You can get a better burger, with exactly what you want on it, for a little less money at Fuddruckers a half mile west of here.

88,Preston S.,"Oklahoma City, OK",162,178,32.0,4.0,2013-03-14,"Red Robin is so good. Great burgers and so many different kinds. Are they the best in the world? No but they are really good. Awesome fries too. You can have all you want but I think I have only ordered a fry refill once. Great fish and chips too. Yes a burger place that has other stuff too. Don't forget the milkshakes either. They bring you the metal mixing tumbler as well so you get a refill. Good selection of beers as well. Of course, you can't really have a beer when you  are on a lunch break from work. Staff is friendly. Service is good. Food comes out pretty quick. One complaint about this location is they don't participate. All commercials say at participating restaurants and you think they all participate. Well guess what this one doesn't. So not all of the corporate promotions are available here. The big one is the rewards card. Which wouldn't be a big deal but when I want my free burger on my Birthday I can't go to this location I have to go to the one by the Chandler Mall. Just a minor annoyance. On a side note Red Robin is one of the places you can still get free food on your Birthday. You just have to sign up for their rewards card. Not a big deal for free food. I do remember a while ago they had this new burger that I just loved the first time I tired it. I think it has pastrami on it and some other stuff, details have faded from memory, but it was really good and I was so sad when they took it away. Darn those limited time teases. Sure it is a little more than your fast food drive thru burger but it is worth it. I will always go back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tempe?start=80,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997,2.6719999999999997

The wings were good, but the onion rings are sliced too thick so the breading fell off.  Burgers were cheeseburger-bacon and guacamole-bacon.

67,Brittany J.,"Scottsdale, AZ",328,170,20.0,2.0,2013-06-13,"One thing that I really like about chain restaurants is that they're generally safe bets and you can come in knowing what to expect in terms of food, service, and cleanliness. As soon as we walked in we were seated at a table that had a few crumbs left behind and was a bit sticky. The server asked us what he could get us before we even had a chance to really sit down, and when we received our drinks the straws were already in the drinks - this is a huge pet peeve of mine since I generally like my straw wrapped and I don't have to worry about cross-contamination between server and patron. Okay, whatever. We ordered the fried zucchini that cost $2 during Happy Hour which was a nice little deal, but I didn't care for them since they tasted mostly like a slice of zucchini that wasn't even cooked long enough with a sad excuse of breading over it. The burgers were tasty and predictable of what you could expect from this chain, and cost about $10 each.  Overall, skip this location and head to the Chandler location if you can. This spot definitely draws in a certain (Wally Word/hick) crowd, and it can definitely feel a tad uncomfortable if you're not used to it. The McDonalds in the Wal Mart across the street must have had a short line tonight.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tempe?start=60,2.408,2.408,2.408,2.408,2.4080000000000004
97,Nathaniel P.,"Tempe, AZ",0,12,,1.0,2013-09-22,"Not worth the bother. I had a hankering for a veggie burger that I didn't want to cook. I'm vegan but not in people's faces about it. I can't eat dairy, but eggs and meat are my choice. Anyway I combed the website to make sure about what to order to go so I don't drive them crazy. They were really helpful on the phone and I told them exactly to the T, just a vegan boca burger without dijon or red robin seasoning, how the website said it. I had to take it back because it was obviously a garden burger (cheese) with some cream sauce on it. Had to wait another 10 mins, looked good so left. It sucks they don't offer any condiments for their boca burger and even the sweet potato fries didn't come with the sweet sour sauce they say it does... Top it all off with, I got through almost the whole burger (with my own condiments) the whole last half edge of the thing was so freezer dehydrated, I couldn't bite into it. I just hope it was stored properly so I don't get sick. So I wouldn't recommend this place to any vegans or especially someone with allergies, sorry but they're kind of ditzy about this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tempe?start=80,2.308,2.308,2.308,2.308,2.308

63,Giselle R.,"Maricopa, AZ",269,1,1.0,1.0,2014-04-19,"I have been a loyal customer to Red Robin for quite some time (as evident by my Red Robin Loyalty Card). My family and I enjoy the atmosphere, the food, and the memories we have formed throughout the years (as evident in our countless family pictures at their establishments). However, I have to review my last dining encounter at their restaurant as a complete and utter disaster. I should start by saying that on this particular day, both of my boys and myself were celebrating the fact that I had completed my Bachelor's degree. So once again, we chose Red Robin to celebrate this occasion (we had previously been to another Red Robin restaurant to celebrate my son's 10th birthday only 13 days prior). It started out like a normal experience, the hostess sat us down and our drink order was taken. On a side note, the freckled lemonade was delicious. My boys ordered their usual mac and cheese and chicken strips. I finally ordered the D.B.G. burger (new item). Long story short, our food came, we started eating and after several checkups from our server and a refill of fries and drinks things took a turn. I had eaten my burger about ¾ of the way when I noticed something different. I thought for a moment that it could have been a thin piece of grilled onions, then I realized my burger didn't have grilled onions. I opened my burger and there it was. . . .a cricket.  From that point, I took a picture, notified our server which notified the manager on duty. He was very apologetic, mentioned that this had never happened before. He asked me if I was okay and I told him that I had no words. He followed up by saying that we did not have to pay for our meals that afternoon. There was no exchange of anything, they didn't know my name and they certainly did not ask for my number. After everything was said and done, I emailed corporate and sent them the pictures along with my side of the story. I was contacted by the senior manager from the store and was assured that they had taken steps to make sure this situation would never happen again. He mentioned how he wanted to make everything better and wanted to invite my whole family back to his establishment. I told him that what I wanted was to be acknowledged and to not have this happen to anybody else. He insisted that we needed to come back and told me that he was to send a gift card so my WHOLE could have a better dining experience.  I received a $30 gift card with no note.  Again, I have no words. Thank you for making me feel like a valued customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tempe?start=60,2.5320000000000005,2.5320000000000005,2.5320000000000005,2.5320000000000005,2.5320000000000005

We had a waiter who was very friendly and never had us feeling forgotten about or less important than the other customers. The food was great and orders were correct, so nothing to complain about there. The waiter doubled up as the bartender and he had the friendly persona to go with it. I'm updating my 1 star review to a 4 star since 3 would be stingy with an all around good experience. (& glad I didn't get the waitress we got last time!) -----EDIT----- 1 Star I'm used to great food and service with Red Robin, but this location was very disappointing. The waitress brought us drinks with no ice, and when I asked if we could get some, she mentioned they were running low. The issue with this, is every other drink that came out of the kitchen had a normal and decent amount of ice. This was inconsistent and bothersome.  The waitress approached our table initially, and she would only interact with my husband. This followed through when she had brought more ice back in her pitcher of water, and managed to only give him ice while she managed to give me none during the next refill.  Just bad service. I love the food for the price, but I won't be going back to this particular location.

Our server, who was a taller, bigger guy with glasses in the bar was very rude and even laughed when we asked for bottomless fries before the food came out. He even shook his head when we sat down and could hear him talking smack about us to another employee. Worst service we have had anywhere at any point in time while dining out. HOWEVER!!! this last time we decided to give this location another shot and went in around 7 pm on wednesday march 18th. We were greeted by the very nice girls at the front and were sat in the bar promptly, again. Needless to say we were very skeptical because it was the same exact booth we sat in at our previous experience. This place was packed and everything was shaping up to be yet again another bust. Well when the bartender, Mike, came up to us and greeted us we knew things would be different. Mike was so awesome right from the get go. He took the time to ask if we've ever been in before, eventhough it was really busy, and proceeded to go through happy hour specials and made some really sweet recommendations on drinks, appetizers, and entrees. He was very fast and extremely attentive. We could see how busy he was making all of those shakes! It did not even come close to altering the level of service provided to us. Mike made us feel like we were regulars and that we weren't customers but rather friends at his home. It was amazing to see him be so polite and respectful to all of the guests around us. He talked me into getting the smokin burger and boy was he right when he said it was like a bacon cheeseburger on steroids. BEST BURGER EVER!!! We will definitely be back and will most definitely ask for Mike again, although he told us that he had confidence that if we sat with anyone we would have the same service.

We always sit in the bar because we are over 21 and we love how they changed that rule so that we don't have to worry about sitting next to children. The bartenders are always on point and gives us great service. We always come in at night and the bartenders are usually either a man named Adrian or a man named Mike. They are both outstanding at their jobs but Mike is the best bartender or server that we've experienced at any restaurant. He is so friendly and so quick and to watch him make all those drinks and serve all the tables that he is serving is really something to watch. We were in this last Wednesday and he seemed to have a pretty big group of regulars that was sitting next to the window that were drinking pretty heavily and while sometimes one specific guy that was in the group was getting pretty loud and obnoxious he was hilarious and very entertaining. The whole bar was filled up and we still never had to ask for anything ever. Mike even noticed that we had stopped eating and brought us boxes and kids for the sauces to take home. It's very impressive that he notices the little things like that and is one of the many reasons we continue to done at this location. I love drinking the mai tai while I'm in there because it is not too strong and not too weak. it's always just so perfect and comes in that cool little glass. We will continue to come into this location because it is by far better than the other locations that we've been into for Red Robin and the service is just always so great. Again Mike is so awesome and we look forward to date night every week at this location and hope to see him when we're in the next time but to know we'll still get great service if he is not there is a pretty big bonus.

The fries are okay but the seasoning isn't quite like I remember and just tastes more salty than flavourful.

I got a diet coke and the waitress seemed to forget about us after we paid our bill I was dying of thirst due to all the salt. My bill was like 17 something (plus a tip) and I kind of feel like that was highway robbery. I just feel you can get a better lunch deal elsewhere...

Came here for my wife's free birthday burger and to try their version of the ramen burger, the Red Ramen. It's fine.  The ramen bun is too hard and crunchy.  It's not chewy and cooked through like other ramen burger buns.  Makes it really tough to eat since you can't press it down and it cuts the roof of your mouth.  The balance of ingredients in it was mediocre, in relation to the meat.  With how bland the bun was and how much of the thing was actually ramen bun, they could have beefed up the flavors in the burger itself. Also had the prime chophouse burger which has cheese, steak sauce, and fried onions in it.  This was a pretty tasty burger.  Much better balanced than the ramen burger here. I get it.  Red Robin can't compare to the best in the country, but like Yelp says for 3-star joints, it's A-OK.  Bottomless steak fries.  Lots of dipping sauces (like the bacon aioli, addictive but bad for you I'm sure.)  Decent burger that they will leave a little pink.  You come for value and time to hang out, not because it's the best burger out there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tempe,3.36,3.36,3.36,2.444,3.3600000000000003

You used to be my legit favorite restaurant (in my college days) but after a few too many poor experiences, tonight you put the final nail in the coffin.  I arrived with my husband and 1-year-old son at 6:30 on a Saturday night. 15 minute wait- that's fine, to be expected for a weekend evening. We were seated and things were busy, but not packed. We made our orders (two bacon cheeseburgers, nothing complicated) and requested some fries before our meals to keep our son happy. Our waiter said he'd try, but that the kitchen was barely keeping up with fries that evening so he didn't know how long it would be. (I saw several other tables with fries laid out before their meals.) But assuming he only meant a few more minutes, we said no problem and pulled out some graham crackers for him.  45 minutes and an embarrassing amount of graham crackers later, there was still nothing at our table. Our waiter stopped by 30 minutes into it and said it would just be ""a few more moments"". After another 15 minutes my husband convinced me that it was time to go. We left a couple of bucks for his soda and left.  There never seemed to be any sort of hurry, our waiter rarely checked on us, and we were most frustrated because our son was doing really well for the first half hour. As he became hungrier and impatient, so did we. We were two hours from home and still needed to get on the road so we settled for fast food.

They only brought two plates with our appetizers then asked us if we needed a third plate for three people.  The food was so horrible that could not eat my sandwich and requested a refill of fries but the waitress didn't care enough to ask us how our food was and only threw down the basket of fries on the table.  I don't recommend this place to anyone.  Worst place in town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tempe?start=40,2.92,2.92,2.92,2.052,2.92

Their bottomless fries.  Tasty.  And if your don't want ff's you can substitute steamed brocolli, coleslaw, and a couple other things are an even exchange.  They will also substitute sweet potato fries for like $1.50 but it's bottomless too.  They also have a bottomless root beer float for $3.19 that's made with Barqs. Now you might want to clarify this with the server cuz I think that only the root beer is bottomless, not the ice cream too. A soda is $2.79!   Eegad, if that's not a reason to order a cocktail or beer I don't know what is. I really like the California Chicken burger.  Chicken breast, avocado, bacon, lettuce, tomato, etc. P oMy son almost always gets a burger.  Funny how that is, I come here to get away from a hamburger. I think their happy hour is lame to mediocre so I'll steer clear of going here ever again just for that. Our server, Carol, below par.  We waited to be approached long enough that we had made up our minds about what we're going to order. When she did come for our drink order we choose to order our entire meal.  I had questions about a menu item and she was not aware or informed.  While placing our order she walked away to attend another table.  I thought that could have waited.  After our meal had been delivered she was apparently done serving our table.   We had to ask the bartender for a refill on the bottomless items we ordered and when Carol delivered one of the items I asked for a soda refill. She topped my drink with a different beverage.  Had to wait, again, for her to come by so that could be rectified.   No ""sorry about that"". She's just one server here so that shouldn't be a reason to avoid dining here.  It was a reason to lower the number of stars I'll give for my experience.   Come if you're hungry, like French fries, and a free reign diet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tempe,2.96,2.96,2.96,2.284,2.96

We should have immediately took this as a sign and left. However, since we are both in the food industry, we decided they were probably just overreacting. Once we were finally sat, which was a whole process in itself , it took our server Jessica over  5 minutes  before finally greeting us and offering us something to drink. By this time we had already known what to order. Our appetizer had a strange aftertaste and wasn't a good start. The food that came out was delivered to us by the manager, I ordered a ""banzai"" burger and my girlfriend ordered the ""blta croissant"" both meals came out cold, including our fries and onion rings. The fries were literally the last of the batch, the cold stale tiny bits, as the table next to us had just ordered another round, and they had to wait for fresh ones to be made. The burger was missing one of the signature ingredients, the pineapple. Naturally we were both upset considering we came here to celebrate an anniversary. I flagged down the waiter and explained to her our situation. She was very self-absorbed and had no empathy. I explained to her that while I understand you can't control what comes out of the kitchen, but for the cooks, the expo and the manager all to neglect the product and serve cold food was upsetting. She rude fully commented that ""we are busy, sorry. If it was me bringing the food out I would have caught the mistake."" Also told us that she couldn't tell the expo anything because they used to be a manager and was scared too. She didn't offer anything for the inconvenience, nor did she offer to have the manager come over to discuss. Very displeased with the service and food.

This restaurant has not been updated yet. We sat down right away and although there were plenty of tables open they put us a half booth next to the kitchen and the table top and menus were super sticky. It took almost 10 minutes for the server to take our order, so by then we were ready to place our food and drink order at the same time. Then we sat and waited. And waited. And waited. They rest had barely any guests (I should have realized just by that) 30 min later still no food. The waitress never came over once to say the food was almost ready. She did bring us napkins and knives, no forks. Since the food was taking so long she brought over a thing of fries, which none of us ate, we don't like RR Fries, and she might have figured that out since none of us ordered fries with our meals. Finally the food came out. My husband's medium-rare burger was charcoal. My 9 year old daughter found a hair in her mandarin oranges (pubic hair size, BARF), and my Cobb salad was brought out with tartar sauce instead of blue cheese dressing. Who does that?! We all lost our appetites by the very site of the food, and couldn't wait to pay and leave.  This whole restaurant needs a makeover along with the staff. I did observe (since I was facing the kitchen) that none of the cooks where hair nets on their head or beards (so frickin nasty). I would never on God's green earth ever eat here again.
