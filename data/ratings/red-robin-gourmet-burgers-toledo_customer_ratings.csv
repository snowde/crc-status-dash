21,Billy L.,"Monroe, MI",0,247,2.0,4.0,2012-06-27,I really like the turkey burger at Red Robin. It's got a good taste to it and it's a fairly decent size. The fries are a little meh. This store has a nice atmosphere to it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-toledo?start=20,,,,,
25,Todd E.,"Toledo, OH",3,6,2.0,4.0,2012-07-27,"Good food, decent prices. The staff is usually fairly attentive to your table. Can be a little loud and is often busy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-toledo?start=20,,,,,
16,Long P.,"Toledo, OH",162,49,11.0,4.0,2012-12-13,Welcome to the Bird!  So much better than Burger Bar 419. The burger patty has a great amount of flavor that you can savor. I got the guacamole bacon burger. The bottomless steak fries are tastiy and you can add the seasoning salt to make it even better. They also have great ranch dressing to dip your fries (also try Campfire sauce). The only thing I was disappointed in was that my burger wasn't the temperature I would have liked to eat it at (a little colder; I did order it medium though..also maybe the guacamole and lettuce cooled it down...). I left feeling satisfied and the right amount of full (not bloated). Waitress was really nice too.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-toledo,,,,,
19,Niket A.,"Toledo, OH",2,2,,5.0,2014-03-28,Friendly place...excellent staff...variety of burgers to choose from. Reasonably priced and the yukon chips are a must order appetizer,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-toledo,,,,,
5,Razoun R.,"Perrysburg, OH",40,108,736.0,2.0,2014-04-03,"The service. The service. The service!! The service is just constantly an issue. Whyyyyyyyyyyy. Why is it so hard to be cordial? Polite? Friendly? Happy? It's a customer service JOB. It's ok. I've done it and I know what it is like. Greeted by a grumpy hostess. Then comes our waiter. Where do I start. Kid was completely out of it. He mixed up my side, so instead of taking my plate back. He actually says why don't you grab your appetizer plate and slide your burger off of here. I'll bring you another side. He just stood there as I clumsily destroyed my burger as I was trying I reach into the tray that he held. Fast forward ten minutes or so. Was on the last couple of bites of burger and here comes my side. A big clump of cheesy fries that looked (and tasted) like it's been sitting under the heat lamp.  Anywhoooo. The manager was really nice. Kept trying to ask what is wrong. Was having one of those days where I didn't want to complain about the staff and have them get in trouble. But by the time the bill came I was done.  Used to come here often. Don't see that happening anymore. For about $15 a person, I'd rather have a burger somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-toledo,,,,,
20,Austin W.,"Valparaiso, IN",0,7,1.0,1.0,2014-06-30,"First off. Our server did the best she could. Secondly we went there and told them we had dairy allergies. When we got home all of us felt terrible. Our food was incorrect for half of our orders. And we had to send them back. Multiple times. Food was mediocre at best and in the end we regretted eating there. We also realized when we felt ill, that would mean that the allergy menu was inaccurate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-toledo?start=20,,,,,
11,Paul G.,"Toledo, OH",0,22,2.0,2.0,2014-07-06,Food was adequately presented even though service was slow.  Hamburger was dry but no complaints about fish. The problem with this Toledo Red Robin is that the food is very mediocre. I only eat there when others insist.  I guess some people like the food but this is not for me. Ten dollars was taken off Neal by manager for slow service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-toledo,,,,,
22,Thomas S.,"Toledo, OH",0,36,,2.0,2014-07-12,"Not on my list of favorites. Go there once a year, grandkids birthday choice. Never satisfied. Place makes me nervous somehow, acoustics are bad and it seems like a mad house, so much rushing around...can't seem to relax. Grandkids like it, they sing to them, that's all that matters, I can tolerate it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-toledo?start=20,,,,,

14,Scott M.,"Van Wert, OH",20,63,1.0,4.0,2015-05-09,"Have eaten here several times, never had a problem.  Last time had an excellent salad with chicken and a good vinaigrette dressing.  Beer on draft is a little pricey but was great.  Service has always been prompt and pleasant.  Bottomless fries are awesome.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-toledo,,,,,
8,Matt M.,"Toledo, OH",28,5,,1.0,2015-08-15,"Horrible, horrible service. Three different visits, three instances of mixed up orders, inattentive staff and slow service. Will never step in this restaurant again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-toledo,,,,,
6,James M.,"Newport, MI",57,709,347.0,4.0,2015-08-20,"Never been a Red Robin fan. However, with the exception of the slooow service, everything was spot on with my most recent visit. Menu has changed a bit, but in a good way. LOVED the buzzard wings, all of our burgers were GREAT, & dessert was OUTSTANDING! Everything was fresh & our server was very attentive. Thus far this is my favorite RR location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-toledo,,,,,
7,Pete F.,"Toledo, OH",1,22,,2.0,2015-12-29,Well...........we went for my Birthday and it was......ok. Best thing was the fries. My burger was a little dry and the wife said her Prime rib sandwich was medicore. Her salad was nasty and the onion rings were way to greasy. My son got his usual plain cheeseburger. When he got his burger it didn't have cheese on it. She took it back and they threw a cold piece of cheese on a burger that was already cooked.......surprise! Not melted! His favorite was the milkshake. I guess I will stick to 5 guys.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-toledo,,,,,
15,Collin G.,"Tuscaloosa, AL",0,7,,2.0,2016-02-16,Red Robin is past its prime. The burgers use to be think and juicy. Now they feel like they came out of a freezer. The fries and burgers came to the table cold. There seems to be a ton of staff here but everyone is just milling around.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-toledo,,,,,
10,Robin M.,"Fayette, OH",11,6,3.0,5.0,2016-03-30,"Well just ate at red robins for the 2nd time. Our experience was the same as last time. Food was great and our server was Kenzie this time.

3,Jeffrey B.,"Bowling Green, OH",0,2,,5.0,2016-09-20,I am a legit reviewer as any of the characters in that one South Park episode about Yelp reviewers were as well. I've only been to this Red Robin once but was very comfortable as usual!

4,Tiffany W.,"San Angelo, TX",0,10,6.0,2.0,2017-01-28,"I'm a lover of Red Robin but I was extremely disappointed by my last visit. I went with friends and ordered the teriyaki chicken sandwich (which is one of my favorites) with a side of teriyaki sauce because I love to dip my fries in it too!!! When my sandwich arrived there was no teriyaki sauce on it and no side. When I asked about it, the food runner said ""yeah they ran out of that sauce"" I was slightly stunned because isn't that the entire point of the sandwich  she apologized but just walked away and offered no solution. When our waitress came to see if everything was ""tasting ok"" I let her know that NO it wasn't ok that I got a plain chicken sandwich. I didn't want to order anything new because it was a busy Friday night and my friends had already received their food and been eating it. Thankfully she agreed with me that a plain sandwich was not ok and she at least went to get the managers attention. The manager then arrived at the table and brought me a cup of the teriyaki sauce and apologized. So all was right in the end BUT I'm still wondering if they were OUT then were did that sauce come from and why wasn't it originally on my sandwich??? My speculation is they were running low and were just trying to conserve and to pull a fast one on me.... but it caused a lot of hassle and I'm just not pleased :/",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-toledo,3.4,3.4,3.4,,3.4000000000000004
1,Kelsey S.,"Toledo, OH",83,16,,3.0,2017-07-27,"Red Robin as a chain isn't too bad. The food is fresh and hot, but isn't anything particularly distinct from any other burger joint. Their drinks are pretty tasty, the staff is pretty great.   However, unless we're going while it's dead and not busy, a lot of times there's quite a bit of a wait to get seated to eat. Depending on who the cook is for the day, sometimes the food isn't as good as it should be with some of their other staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-toledo,3.4,3.4,3.4,,3.4000000000000004
