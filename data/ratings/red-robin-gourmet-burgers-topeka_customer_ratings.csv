31,Sherri G.,"Topeka, KS",1,9,,1.0,2012-02-04,"Ate there last night and it was not good on so many levels.   we waited several minutes for the server  to take our drink order, several more to take our meal order and we asked several times for fries. Our soups  came out after the meal was served.  The mac and cheese for the kids came out of a bag, the burger was rare to the point of being nearly raw. ""grilled' onions were not grilled but tasted more boiled and the bun was soaking wet.  Very disappointing to spend $50 on a meal most of us didn't or couldn't eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-topeka?start=20,2.436,2.436,2.436,2.436,2.436
21,Carol G.,"Topeka, KS",33,303,486.0,4.0,2012-05-20,"I've been here for meals a couple of times and it's always been great.  Love the burgers and the salads are good too. The latest trip was after a movie with a couple of friends. We went for dessert only, to cap off the night. It was about 45 minutes before they were closing. So, no one noticed when we walked in. The couple we were with boldly stepped forward and seated themselves - which embarrassed me to death, but has absolutely nothing to do with the restaurant, beyond their lack of attention. The booth they choose, had a seat was completely unconnected to the rest of the booth - and could be a disaster if it slipped while trying to sit down on it.  The server was pleasant and did his best. Again, the couple we were with, embarrassed us by trying to be coy and witty with their comments. Didn't really work at the end of a day for the waiter. He kinda had the ""deer in the headlights"" look from the off the cuff comments coming from our dinner companions. I'm sure he was exhausted and wanted to go home. He got our orders correct and did his best to stay up beat. No complaints there.  The dessert selection is slim but when you order one of their meals I can't imagine holding dessert too, so in all reality, it's adequate. We got the Mountain High Mud Pie and split it. Chocolate ice cream on some kind of creamy base. it was okay, but nothing spectacular. The two with us ordered a Salted Caramel Malt and some kind of cookie with ice cream on top... nothing terribly unique, but I didn't hear any complaints out of either of them, and both finished off their selections in record time, so I imagine they enjoyed it. Ultimately our friends made up for their obnoxiousness with a very, very generous tip.  My opinion: go for the food, enjoy the plethora of fries and skip the dessert.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-topeka?start=20,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.736

We wanted to find a place we could visit with our large family on every trip & make it a sorta tradition! We have found our place Red Robin! Such a warm & friendly place! There is so much open floor chatter that when we r talking or the kids r loud it doesn't seem to matter or make a difference! & yet some how we could talk to each other in a normal tone & hear each other perfectly! Has to be the open dinner thing they have going on!?!  Makes life less stressful for me after a long day! Waitress was great! Very attentive, very friendly, brought us fries to hold us over, appetizer was great (pretzels), & everyone's meals came out great! Managers we seen were very hands on & very involved!

24,Chris B.,"Shawnee, KS",12,50,3.0,2.0,2013-05-02,"It's the Applebee's of burger joints.  I had not been in a while and was somewhat craving it since I was in Topeka and well, not familiar with local fare.  We got there during the May Day blizzard, snowing like a crazy winter storm on May 2nd.  We were sat immediately in the bar section and treated to fries and some dip - which was a new experience to me, like chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant. After about 5 minutes, I realized that there was a puddle of water on the bench next to me after it rolled across the bench and drenched my butt.  Thinking it was just water from a previous spill, I wiped it up and moved onto munching the fries.  about a minute later, I realized that the ceiling was leaking and brought it up to our water - Corey.  He immediately moved us, no big deal but in the process he mentioned that he couldnt believe that the hostess sat us there.  Um hello?  You started serving us there, you could have easily addressed it before it was an issue for us.  Not to moan and groan but it's a juvenile service issue. I ordered the Five Alarm burger without a bun - trying to watch my figure.  It came highly over-cooked and with fresh Jalapeno's, my favorite vegetable.  I washed it down, I am not one to complain at corporate chains, the rollover is atrocious, there is no way you can manage that mess.  The meat was dry, I didn't get the salsa mix that my partner got and by the time I was done eating, we saw Corey again and it was too late. I would say the fries and the fry dip are the best parts of this place.  I thought the fries and dip for a pre-meal appetizer was brilliant until they brought out more fries with our meal.  I would suggest to Red Robin that they just keep that basket full and forget adding fries to the meals.  I would imagine that they would save a lot of money and eliminate a lot of waste.  I was done with fries by the time we got our burgers so the fries with the meal, neither one of us didn't even touch them.   Maybe it was a monumentally bad day for chef Robin, maybe it was just what it was but I know the next time I am in Topeka for business, I will look elsewhere for a good burger.  Any suggestions?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-topeka?start=20,2.568,2.568,2.568,2.568,2.5680000000000005

19,Eddie V.,"Hammond, LA",7,55,49.0,2.0,2014-05-19,"I came here with a party of ten people on sunday evening. When i called a few days ahead they told me that they do not take reservations, and in fact we should not even come in because it will be too busy because it is graduation. Uuum weird. I then asked the girl on the phone how long she expected the wait time to be. She told me at least a half hour to get a table on that particular day she was guessing. I said 'no problem' and that some members of my party would just arrive 30 min early. Then she said once again not to even bother trying cause it would be an hour wait.  So i showed up at 5 30 on sunday may 18th to be safe, and a couple members of my party were already seated. There werent that many people in the dining room either. The whole party had arrived by a little after 6 pm. Our waitress was slow and didnt seem to make us much of a priority. It took her till about 7 pm to get us our drinks and take our orders. The food took a while to get to us, but not longer than you would expect.  When the food did arrive several members of the group were very unhappy that their food was incorrect not only once, but twice. One of our party members ordered buffalo clucks. The first time they came out they came with hard, brown, dry fries. Very unlike the fries that were brought out to our table previous to our orders. Her first order of buffalo clucks also did not look like the buffalo version, as they had no sauce on them. They were however buffalo clucks, as you could taste the hint of ""spice"", but they were dry and cold. They also came with the most disgusting blue cheese and honey mustard (?) ever! She flagged down a manager and sent the food back. When the second order of buffalo clucks came out you could see the obvious difference. There was actually sauce on them, and they looked warm and not like they were bordering on buffalo jerky. My party member also asked for extra buzz sauce (and had a hell of a time getting any) because the first  order was so dry. Which arrived much later, and at that point was un-needed. They kept bringing more ranch instead. When the buzz sauce finally arrived it was really chunky...like it had onion (?!) chunks in it. I used to work at red robin so i dont know how the hell this was possible.  Anyhow, the only person to save this entire red robin experience was the manager, Ross Whorton. He was very accommodating, kind, helpful and seemed like he cared. He comped one of our members their burger which was much appreciated as well. He gave my party comrade his business card when she asked his name so she could find a way to put in a good word for him. As for the rest of the wait staff....well, thats another story. P.s. Not sure where this fits in, but the staff has a major ketchup problem. ALL of the ketchup bottles on the table were empty pretty much. We handed one of the empty bottles to a staff member and asked for a full one. I guess he didnt get it because he just removed the bottle and never returned with a new one. We asked several other staff members, and never got our ketchup.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-topeka,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006,2.6320000000000006

I guess I expected more friendliness towards then since it is a family restaurant. My husband and I's hamburgers tasted pretty good. Nothing over the top though. I can't say I'm a huge fan of their fries. They aren't crispy enough for my liking. My oldest ordered a pizza because she doesn't eat meat, she only took one bite. It had no flavor. The sauce was like straight tomato sauce. We told the waitress and we wanted to order a grilled cheese. She acted like she didn't want to do it. We ended up paying for both of her meals.

When the meal arrived an hour later, they informed me that they dropped my sons burger and we're starting a new one. Another 20 min and my sons food arrived.

22,Marie V.,"Charlotte, NC",17,39,5.0,1.0,2015-09-13,"Haven't felt this unwelcome in a restaurant in a long time. I'm driving from St. Louis to Denver today... Long drive with many fast food options. I stopped at Red Robin hoping for a semi-quick lunch that doesn't come in a paper bag. It's two in the afternoon, admittedly toward the end of a lunch shift, but the Chiefs are playing and I'm sitting at the bar. And sitting, and sitting, and sitting. Ten minutes later.. Carlos half walks up to the table, standing about five feet away, like if he comes too close he has to claim the table. Doesn't say anything. I tell him I haven't been helped and would he clean the table. He asks if I got sat there, I say no, because every Red Robin I've ever been too I am told to seat myself at the bar. He points to another table, presumably one not in his section, and asks why don't I go sit there. I don't want to sit there, I want to watch the game if the Chiefs lose (sorry, Bronco fan). Carlos leaves and I sit there for a minute while I watch Carlos (rag in hand) talking to two managers at the bar. Okay Buddy, you don't want me, I don't want you either.  I get up and go to the hostess and am seated at the less desirable table. It is then that I see Carlos wiping off the other table. He looks at me and I ask if I can sit there. He says if you want. I thought we went through this before.. So I moved back to my original table and he walks away. Sigh. Carlos, you need a different job. Along comes a smiling young lady who introduces herself as Brianna. Asks what I'd like to drink and I let her know I'm ready to order and am in a bit of a hurry (at this point Carlos has wasted fifteen minutes of my short shop). She offers to bring my fries while I wait and returns quickly with my tea. Five minutes later I have my burger and my check (because I'm in a hurry and she thought I might like it.. I did). Way to go Brianna, you get 5 stars. Carlos gets negative 3. Average out to 1 star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-topeka?start=20,,,,,

Also most places you go the managers are starting to go around and talk to the customers which is nice but one I noticed is that he kept on checking on the same couple over and over and no one else.
