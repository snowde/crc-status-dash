104,Dave G.,"Warrington, PA",1,10,,2.0,2012-01-15,Service at times was good I got 4 refills but at other times when you needed something while you were eating the server was not around. The one sandwich was wrong and my burger wasn't hot. Someone on yelp said to ask for spicy ketchup when I did I got mustard. I guess they don't have it or the server didn't know what it was. I've been hear maybe 10 times and most of the time the service is below average.

I ordered my burger medium and it came well done. In fact, everyone's burgers were overcooked and dry.  Other than the fries, none of the kids liked any of the food.  One other peave.

Service was perfectly fine with our server being friendly and quick to check in without being overbearing.  Food is decent. Not my favorite burger place in the general area, but it's never been bad. Burgers are usually a bit overcooked, so don't expect to get a perfectly medium here. Well done is about all they do. Fries are probably the highlight here. They have those large ""Steak fries"" and they are usually pretty crispy. They come with little to no salt, so you can season it to taste. Soups are decent. Nothing that stands out from the crowd, but serviceable.  For a chain, it's above average.

The staff is hit or miss, but they do employ a lot of high school students, and that's to be expected. It's a good first experience for them so I typically take this into consideration when service isn't 100%.

Really, people have nothing much else to do at night than go out and crowd every restaurant in the area, but for some reason, even week nights, this palce is packed to the gills.  Their food is good considering it is a chain. Usually I hate getting burgers at chains because they're often devoid of flavor, but their bacon guacamole burger is awesome. However, their bottomless fries are a joke. They bring out maybe ten fries tops in these baskets and then you have to ask repeatedly to have them refilled, and the second time they come with maybe five fries in them. Also, I substituted fries with my meal for black beans and was given the tinest container of black beans, barely enough to count as a side and more of just a garnish.

52,Gerald S.,"Newtown, PA",1012,2191,6425.0,4.0,2013-05-25,"I stop in on occasion when in the area and feeling the ""burger lust"" hit me.  Red Robin offers a cool semi-roadhouse environment and sliders on the high side of the scale.  My preference was the Onion Burger with sauteed onions, red onion and onion roll for the bun.  Not sure it is still on the menu, but the First Bite Experience was so very pleasurable. Endless French Fries are also a plus for the hungry.  I know there are other things on the menu, but I have never gotten beyond the ground beef disks, fries or rings.  It compares well with Cheeburger Cheeburger, although it may lack a little something side by side with a 5 Guys.  As Grease Palaces go, Red Robin is a solid alternative, and scores well on the comfort scale and as a family activity destination. 08.12.13 - Returned after a movie at Neshaminy AMC. Same roadhouse atmosphere and friendly service. The special Berzerker Burger was nicely spicy and medium pink. Son was way happy with his basic Bacon Cheeseburger.  His thing is to put the fries inside the bun, and he relishes that first bite confirming his sound judgment. We split a Van Shake. It was pretty good, but not at the level of Nifty Fifty, or Chick Fil A.  Still a 4 Star experience.

I guess since there was no tip in it for her she blew me off and decided not to come back with the sauce. That would have been OK except for our waitress also went MIA. So now my onion rings are getting cold and no sauce. I finally had to physically get up and walk over to our waitress when she came to the table next to us and asked if they needed anything and proceeded to walk away in the opposite direction from our table. It was either that or wait another 30 minutes for her to meander back around. So yeah... that was pretty annoying. It was very busy and maybe she was overwhelmed but I expect better service than what we received. I'm giving this place 3 stars for the food but could have easily given 2 stars because of the crappy service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-trevose?start=80,3.68,3.68,3.68,3.0520000000000005,3.6800000000000006

Within 6 minutes our table was ready. The beer selection lacked, the noise level was over the top, literally. It was chuckie cheese with   a good burger. Enter those bottomless fries, a nice twist for the burger side kick, however by the time we refilled, it was time to go. (Thank goodness). We chugged our beers, grabbed a box & left.

The fries were good especially with the sweet Thai sauce. Mhmmm .  I've never been to a full service burger place and I was pleasantly surprised and impressed.  The service was great. Very good server she was super attentive and helped me so much when ordering.  She actually helped me pick out my burger; so the fact I loved it made it even better. It wasn't very busy at lunch but I think it's because it was more of a sit down deal. I was lucky to have an hour lunch :-) . They seemed to have a great selection of craft beers, however I was on lunch break. I don't think it would have been a good idea seeing I love craft beer. Anyways it was great. Definitely give it a shot. I think you will enjoy it. Very very impressed and I hope I come across another one again.

64,Adam E.,"Bensalem, PA",3,16,,1.0,2015-09-24,"Went to this location on a whim with my boyfriend for a date that we barely had time for. I had been here about 2 weeks prior and I was in love with the bottomless fries but when the waitresses came she didn't mention them at all. So when she came back I asked about them and she said they come with any burgers we order and we got the short onion ring tower. Then she comes 10 minutes later with the rings and i ask her again and she finally says oh you can get them before your meal. So I'm like... ""ok yes please that's what I wanted 25mins ago."" After 10 more minutes she brings them and takes our orders. My boyfriend got the guac burger and I got the nacho crunch. The wait for the food wasn't bad but another waitress brought our food out. She called my burger the fiery ghost and i thought about it for a second and remembered i ordered the nacho crunch. So i ask her what she said it was and i told her i ordered the nacho crunch and now that I think back to it she treated my like i was a complete idiot. ""Oh you know you're right it is the nacho crunch im sorry it's been a long day!"" So the burger was nacholess and my boyfriend could tell i was getting upset so he googled the menu for me to make sure nachos were supposed to be on it. And they are otherwise it's not a nacho crunch burger it's just a burger.... So i press the button on the little electronic menu to call the waiter and about 20 minutes go by and nothing so I get up to find one and these two waitresses are sitting in the booth looking at me like I'm crazy. Apparently the call server button just flashes on and off... Or so they told me. I tell them my issue and they send a different waiter to fix it and he seems familiar. Honestly he tried hitting on me before on a dating app so it was super awkward seeing him. He seemed a little grumpy too. At this point i had stuffed my face in bottomless fries, soda, and onion rings so i was stuffed and after he went to fix it i asked him to cancel it. I didnt feel bad at all either my boyfriend was already half way through his burger. Im surprised no one came out to apologize to me it's so unprofessional. I had had a great experience with my parents and it was ruined in one night. I'll never recommend this place to anyone in the future.

I've been to several Red Robin locations over the years and have experienced consistently great food and service. The Neshaminy location is my go to for sure. I've tried most burgers and chicken sandwiches on the menu and they are ALL delicious. No exaggeration. They cook the food perfectly, the fries and dipping sauces are great, and the onion rings are incredible. My favorite is the Royal burger but I switch it up pretty often. The service at this location always stands out. The servers are seriously on top of their tables and the manager always stops by. Everyone is super friendly and helpful. I absolutely love the freckled lemonade and margaritas as well.  I'm also impressed at how clean it is--including the bathroom--for a chain restaurant in such a busy area. The prices are fair and the fries are bottomless! I don't think I will ever get tired of Red Robin. It's great getting a free meal and ice cream every birthday too!

60,Jack C.,"Philadelphia, PA",7,25,,4.0,2015-10-17,"Had a gift card to use so I came down here on a Saturday Night, got some burgers to go and it was a pleasant experience. It was packed when I got there. In order to take out you have to go up to the end of the bar area and make your way around a mob full of people waiting to be seated (some impatiently), the overworked servers, and people that are seated in the bar area. A woman took my order (I'm assuming she was the manager at that moment) and let me know she would call my cell when my food was ready. I waited outside to get fresh air rather than stand around in that packed waiting area. I came in a little early and got the women's attention as she was calling my cell to where I could say, ""Hey, I'm waving at you!"" as she was on the phone with me. She and the servers got a laugh anyway, and my order went smoothly from there. I got a Bacon Cheeseburger for my dad which he loved, and I got a Whiskey River BBQ Burger and a Banzai Burger. The Whiskey BBQ was great as the BBQ Sauce, Onion Straws, Cheddar, and Mayo flavors all went very well together. The Banzai Burger was more average. The pineapple slices did not mix well with the tomato slice as far as flavor goes in my opinion. They kind of offset each other when eating together, because in order to get the sweetness of the pineapple slices you have to bite into the very middle of them to get the juices out of it. And by the time they come out you really can't taste the sweetness of it at all. I was better off just taking the pineapple slices off and eating them separate from the burger. The Steak Fries that come with the burgers were very good. The food was cooked perfectly and the servers/manager were nice so can't complain about that. 4 stars for this experience because getting to pick up is a bit of a hassle on Saturday Nights (certainly not their fault as things would have been much smoother on an off night I'm sure) and the Banzai Burger as I said is average. The service itself was great though as were the Whiskey River BBQ and Bacon Cheeseburgers so me and my dad are fans. I will be coming back to try different burgers next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-trevose?start=60,3.88,3.88,3.88,3.3760000000000003,3.88

I'll be honest, I have a long history of eating spicy foods and have a pretty decent tolerance.  I have former experience with ghost peppers and had my butt kicked several times by them.  This burger...was embarrassingly not hot at all.  I mean with all the peppers they jammed on it, I never broke a sweat.  Lacked flavor too and the burger tasted like a Burger King Patty.  The famous bottomless steak fries were a shadow of what they used to be...soggy, limp and a very small portion.   I guess they are in the midst of rebuilding their identity and menu but I think they took a step backwards, or even sideways because it's nothing like it used to be.  I was really bummed because of how much I love this place.  Maybe it was an off night, maybe not.  I'd say I'll give it another go but this was not the RR I was used to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-trevose?start=20,3.8,3.8,3.8,3.1440000000000006,3.8

It was my first time and my server answered all my questions. I got chips with salsa and guac because I was sold on it by my server. The salsa was your average salsa but the guac had a kick of lime which I love so I wish there was more of that. They gave it to you in little plastic condiment cups so I guess it makes sense for the price but I wished there was a bigger size option. The burgers are good. I have the prime chophouse and my BF got the big fiery ghost style tavern  burger. This one was pretty spicy but still enjoyable.

It was about 8 wings served on a platter of chips and fried onions. The sauce was on the sweet side and the wings were served hot and saucey. The burgers here are pretty good for around $10. They were filling, fresh, and creative. For the patties, I've noticed that lately, it's not as well-seasoned as it used to be so it was lacking some flavor for me.

63,Sahil J.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,3,,2.0,2016-02-21,"This was my third and maybe last visit to this place within a year and how about if I just give everyone a overview of the first two times and a summary of the third. First visit: Sat in the bar area, mediocre service from the sever but wasn't bad. But exceptional service from the bartender who is still the same guy still. Burgers were great! Second visit: Sat in the second(middle) dining area. Food was great again and I was able to customize the heck out of one of their signature burger. Our server was great but we did have our first bad experience during that visit where we had to TWICE ask one of the guys who was cleaning around us to stop sweeping the carpet while we were having our dinner. He acknowledged our concern and moved about a foot away and continued doing it. So that left a sour taste in my mouth. Third visit:(tbl 51)Upon entering the restaurant we can see that is was pretty busy and it was around 9:20 in the evening on a Saturday so that was expected. We walked up to the greeter and were greeted and this is when it all went South. Our host who was standing right behind our greeter. He went to grab a couple of menus for us when he accidentally knocked a few them down to the ground and proceeded to kick them under the table while the greeter in a very playful manner kept yelling at him to stop. He did not listen and continued doing it and then turned to us and said ""You can follow me"". Then we walked about five steps and for some reason he went back to the greeter and started chatting and fooling around with her again. At this point we were very confused and a bit aggravated because we were just standing in the middle of the walkway with no one leading us to a table. Then my partner said ""are we suppose to seat ourself"" when a few seconds later he ran up in front of us again like nothing ever happened and looked around the dining area and stated ""everything looks full, where would you guys like to sit?"". We had no idea what to tell him so I pointed to the only open table and said ""I guess that one right there is fine"". He sat us there, gave us our menus and wished us a good meal and left. About 8 minutes after we were seated, our server walked up to us, very pleasantly introduced herself as ""Angela"" to us and offered us drinks. Upon questioning her about any specials, she stated ""we don't really have any specials, but we do have some special beers which are listed in the front near the bar"". At this point we were already a bit annoyed so we asked her to come back in a couple of minutes while we looked through our menus and also picked a drink. Then she came back and we ordered a 22oz Yuengling Lager and a Blue Moon. Then she had to leave and come back twice because we weren't ready with our orders yet. Before walking away the second time she instructed us to push the ""CALL SERVER"" button on the remote ordering pad when we are ready and she'll come right over. Within about 5 minutes of her leaving we pushed that button and waited for her to come take our orders. About 10 minutes later another server came over and disappointedly asked if somebody had taken our orders and we told her no and that we were waiting on our server after pushing the button. As she completed our orders, Angela reproached our table and said ""sorry about that guys, your food will be up shortly"". We waited another 20 minutes roughly and our food came out. Upon inspection of the burgers, they looked well made but were not ""right off the grill hot"". Mine was ordered to be cooked ""medium"" and my partner's was ordered to be cooked ""well"". They both were about the same temperature to touch and the fries seemed to have had been sitting for a bit also. While indulging in our meals, we had all kinds of unprofessional and distracting playfulness happening all around us. Granted that our table was right by the kitchen, so we probably saw and heard more than we needed to. When Angela came back to our table and asked if we wanted another round of beers, we told her no but maybe later. Then we asked her for a box to put our leftovers in that was pretty much the last time we saw her before we asked her for our check about 25 minutes later. Between that we did want to place an order for dessert but again couldn't locate her for a bit but luckily a manager by the name of Justin was standing right by our table and overheard us talking about ordering dessert. He approached and asked if he could help us with anything and we told him that we just wanted to order dessert and couldn't find our server.He proceeded to tap on the kiosk on the corner of the table and without showing me and having me do it it myself he just placed the order of the Gooey chocolate brownie cake with ice cream and berry sauce. At this point I don't know if you guys think I'm being petty but his way of helping me made me feel foolish. I didn't place the order myself because I had no idea, I was able to order it without berry sauce.It was all very childish & poorly managed",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-trevose?start=60,3.4,3.4,3.4,3.3040000000000003,3.4000000000000004

I then for entree I got the feiry ghost double burger. Was good and really spicy. But that's the way I like most of my food. Back in the day it was always the 5 alarmer burger I got. As a place that are known for burgers they have many to choose from. And the burgers are packed well. And come out fresh as any burger should. The steak fries that come with it are also good.

Then the server came over and just asked us if we were ready. I ordered a medium burger and my friend ordered a well done burger both orders were completely different orders and our burgers came out with the opposite temperatures. My friend also asked for no sauce on his and got the sauce. It also took over 10 minutes each time we asked for refills on our bottomless fries.  The server didn't seem overwhelmed because their was plenty of staff just didn't seem to care very much. Hope he was new or just having a bad day.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-trevose?start=20,3.48,3.48,3.48,3.2720000000000002,3.4800000000000004

8,Marlyn V.,"Morrisville, PA",935,681,873.0,5.0,2016-05-09,"It is very hard to be a good chain restaurant, because you are almost set up for Yelp failure as soon as you open.  This is simply because it's almost like you're a sellout for not being a mom & pop place. Well, I am here to tell you, that for a chain, Red Robin as really won my vote despite all that.  Pros:  1. Reasonable prices for a full meal of burger and fries (around $10) 2. Bottomless Steak fries - uhh where else does this happen? 3. A variety of fun burgers and chicken sandwiches 4. Reasonably priced drinks 5. Short wait time during busy times Cons: 1. It's a chain. Ok, now with that out of the way, I just want to say that living in Bensalem, you can't avoid chain restaurants, and not the terrible kind either, considering in this same mall there is a Crackle Barrel and a Chik fila, which for a North Jersey girl - these are high commodities. As for Red Robin, we came to have a cheap and quick meal after spending $18 on a burger and fries in a local micro brewery - which was delicious, but just way too much for a meal that consisted of a burger and fries. So here are my three favorite burgers that will make you beleive you are NOT in a chain restaurant.  1. Bonzai Burger if you like something sweet and tangy. A little more on the adventurous side since it does have pineapple slices in it, but completely delicious and will make you wish you always put pineapple in your burgers.  2. Guacmole Burger - this is messy and delicious, and I am a bit bias, because you could put guacomole on roadkill and I would probably love it. 3. Chili Cheeseburger - this is my favorite burger, it is a disaster to eat - get utensils! The chili is very tasty and it is one hearty meal, so make sure you come in starved. As for sides, I'm not much of a steak fries girl, but with their fancy dipping sauces I am! I like the spicy ketchup and some fancy creamy bbq sauce one they have for free. But most of the time I go for the onion rings, because these are some of the BEST onion rings I've ever had. They are crispy and flavorful, I only wish these too were bottomless! Overall, I would definitely come back, they are also very family friend, they give balloons to the kids, they have milkshakes (and adult versions too) and the decor inside is actually  really cute.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-trevose,3.56,3.56,3.56,3.508,3.5600000000000005
54,Kathleen M.,"Philadelphia, PA",26,90,65.0,3.0,2016-06-17,"Since I started dating my boyfriend in March, we have been here 3 times. The first time we were here, the service was really good. The waitress was very friendly (we are still trying to figure if she remembered My bf, they went to school together). The 2nd time we went here it was somewhat busy but they ask you for your cellphone number and it sends you a message when your table is available. They asked us if we wanted to sit in the bar area (if not we would wait a bit longer). The only problem with a bar area is that people are louder in that area. It was hard to hear and i was slightly grouchy that evening. The food again was really good. During these two visits, I ordered the strawberry freckled lemonade to drink. They were really delicious. The waiters/waitresses were very l, they always brought more when you were nearly down to the bottom. The second time there, we ordered the onions rings. They were greasy (not in a bad way). The third time we were here, I tried the Mint Brownie Shake (i even shared it with my boyfriend). The shake cannot beat nifty fifties shakes but it was different. Out of the three visits, I ordered two different burgers: the Whiskey River BBQ burger and the bleu ribbon burger. The best part about the Whiskey River BBQ burger was the sauce, it wasn't too sweet. The best part about the bleu ribbon burger was the chipotle aioli.  Reason for 4 out 5 stars: the third time we went, we were out in the back area with 3 other tables. One had about 7-8 people and the other two tables had 2-3 people. Once seated, it took between 5-10 minutes before they acknowledged us. I watched the same three servers walking by us. Also the chair that I almost sat on was wet. I switched the chair because I definitely did not want my dress to get wet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-trevose?start=20,3.48,3.48,3.48,3.2760000000000007,3.4800000000000004

I am a vegetarian and I'm super pleased that they offer both a Boca and a Garden burger option.

We loved the atmosphere. We loved the variety of the kid's menu, including the healthy sides. The menu was awesome. There were a lot of different burger choices for my husband. I appreciated that I had the choice between a Boca Burger and a Gardenburger. I HATE Boca Burgers, but it's a nice option for those who are Vegan. I had the Gardenburger, and it was great, because I love Gardenburgers. So, that was a win. My husband loved his burger as well. The bottomless fries were mediocre at best, but everything was so filling that there really wasn't any need to ask for another helping. The staff was friendly. There were tablets on the table which let you play games, pay your bill or examine the items on the menu, and my husband accidentally opened an app which added a charge to our bill. We asked three times to have the charge removed, as we didn't use the app, and we were reassured that it had been. It never was.

Get home, my pub mac and cheese is the exact same size as the child mac and cheese we ordered except with different cheese sauce at twice the price.
