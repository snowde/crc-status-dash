44,Meredith E.,"Portland, OR",169,501,175.0,2.0,2012-06-05,"I got sat at a comfortable booth with a fantastic view of the dish room. Instead of reading my book during my meal, I watched the servers pre bus their tables and throw away leftover burgers and fries. The manager also had some entertaining discussions while rushing around next to my table.  I ordered the bleu burger. Like the photo in the menu, I was expecting large crumbles of bleu cheese covering my burger with a spicy chipolte mayo and fried onions. The burger itself was delicious. However, the kosher salt like sprinkling of bleu cheese was disappointing. Why even call it a bleu burger? Service started out great with an immediate water refill. As soon as my burger arrived, the server handed me the bill and I never saw him again.  I noticed they now have a bar in this location. In fact, I saw my neighbor enjoying himself with a few brews.  Word on the street is the happy hour is a good time. I may be back for that, but not for a burger in the restaurant area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-troy?start=40,2.408,2.408,2.408,2.408,2.4080000000000004
43,Nikki C.,"Detroit, MI",134,348,24.0,3.0,2012-08-14,"My co-worker and I ate in here with an hour for lunch. Granted, we went at noon (not our choice), so it was bound to be busy. But we sat at the bar (cut out the middle man, went straight to the bartender for ordering), but it took quite a while for our entire process, anyway. Apparently, someone called off (that's what I could gather from the chatter between the staff) during a heavy lunch time.  We scarfed our food down very quickly, but from what I could tell, it was tasty, as expected from Red Robin! I had the turkey burger and added avacado slices. It was hot and ready and so was I (for the food!) The seasoned fries were as good as they usually are, as well.  I definitely wouldn't go during lunch rush hour again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-troy?start=40,2.508,2.508,2.508,2.508,2.508
51,Carolyn C.,"Morris, MN",2,106,,2.0,2012-12-21,Let me start this review by saying that I love Red Robin. My fiance and I met at Red Robin and whenever we want to have a fun inexpensive date we find the nearest Red Robin eat until we're in a burger coma. So why the low review? This particular Red Robin is definitely sub par. The fries were mushy and over salted. The burgers were cooked well but if you top a piping hot burger with FROZEN vegetables and cold condiments it ruins the whole thing. The server was attentive and it was actually quiet when we went. If you want delicious Red Robin Burgers I suggest going to another location.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-troy?start=40,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44

31,Jim E.,"Belleville, Canada",455,286,1086.0,3.0,2013-04-21,"It took us a while to try Red Robin but when we did we were pleasantly surprised.  After a long day in the D we wanted something fast with a fun atmosphere, inside it is decorated nicely and lively.   The service was average, and the food was pretty good.  I like the Steak fires (most places do not have then) and the Blue Cheese Cheeseburger with an Onio bun was good to and better then I have had other places for sure (Logans, TGI Fridays).  The Mile High Pie dessert was pretty good, I find most desserts do not compare to the Olive Garden and Cheesecake Factory and Red Robin is no exception.

33,Richard F.,"Bloomfield Hills, MI",85,512,10.0,3.0,2013-05-02,"I was to meet a buddy for lunch and he gave me the wrong address.  I am lost if I can't use my GPS, so when the address turned out to be useless, I called him on the phone and asked him where I really should be.  He realized his mistake and he offered to meet me at this great place he knows and gave me that address.  So I ended up at the same Red Robin I visited last time. Well it was better and it was worse.  The burger was a bit rarer than the medium rare I ordered.  But I guess that is better than the other way around. I had a Royal Burger that includes a fried Egg, bacon cheese and more.  That too was tasty.  I tried a different kind of bun that I have not had at this chain before.  It was a Jalapeno Kaiser bun and I really liked it.  I also appreciated the frequent refills on our beverages and the offer and delivery of more nice hot fries.  We sat and munched them as we chatted. What was a bit hard to take was the cost of the meal.  We each had a burger and fires and nothing to drink other than water.  Yet the tab with tip and tax was over $ 13.00 each.  I don't mind spending that amount for a great meal at a fine place, but for a burger an fries?  I think Red Robin has drifted out of control. Yeah, I would go back, but I certainly am not rushing back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-troy?start=20,2.604,2.604,2.604,2.604,2.604

The staff at this Red Robin is wonderful, and I am very happy with the service and the food.. The burgers are always good, and I am very picky about my burgers.

Nowadays I will go a few times a year, mostly with family. I really like all of the bun and patty options available for their burgers. You can customize your sandwich with a wide variety of buns, including wheat and a lettuce wrap. You can also select your type of patty, from beef to turkey to veggie. Combined with various side options, along with the standard bottomless fries, Red Robin is usually a fine place for an easy dinner. Are their burgers mind-blowing and awesome? No. But they're consistent at what they do.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-troy?start=40,2.7039999999999997,2.7039999999999997,2.7039999999999997,2.7039999999999997,2.7039999999999997

Food came out as ordered.  The meat was ordered well-done and was a tad undercooked, but still tasted fine - so no biggie.  Love the low carb food options here -- including the lettuce wrapped burgers and bottomless broccoli.  These options keep me coming back! This Red Robin is very clean and wasn't very busy during our visit.  The waitress was very attentive and kept the drinks refilled.  This is by far my favorite Red Robin location in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-troy,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.7359999999999998,2.736
38,Lori D.,"Huntington Woods, MI",7,92,1.0,5.0,2014-09-13,"My husband and I are regulars at the Red Robin in Madison Heights. The food is always good, but the noise level of the restaurant kept us from going more frequently. A friend told us to try the Troy location. We are SO glad we did. We visited last night and arrived at about 8:30. HAPPY HOUR! A pitcher of beer is $5 and 20 0z glasses are $2. With $3,$5, and $7 appetizers, you can't go wrong! Our server, Ashley, was wonderful! She was warm, friendly and pleasant. She took our drink order right away and we got our yummy onion tower appy with 2 side sauces very quickly. We both ordered burgers. Mine was the Shroom Burger and I added onion straws at no extra charge. The burger was cooked perfectly, as was my husband's, the Whiskey River BBQ burger, his favorite.  What we love about RR is their sides. Bottomless steak fries or salad or fruit or even broccoli. As much as you want, why, you can eat sides until you fall over! I love their iced tea, too, and let me tell you, they have a wedge salad as an appy that will blow your mind! F or $3 it is such a deal!! Sometimes, I order a bowl of French onion soup and the wedge salad. For $8, it is more than a bargain!! Ask about their burger club. If you order 9 burgers, your 10th is free. They add up fast and you get to choose any burger on the menu for free! Also, you get a free burger on your birthday! How can you go wrong!  In addition, we sat on the bar side of the restaurant. It is way more quiet than the other side. We had a wonderfully relaxing evening, drank good beer, ate great food and watched the Tiger ball game! A slice of Heaven, for sure!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-troy?start=20,2.804,2.804,2.804,2.804,2.804

She said she's get me a refill, then took care of two other tables, someone else brought our meal, and I had to share my dates drink at one point. It was a really long wait to order, to get the bill, everything. My date got a burger with the extra 1.50 for onion rings, his whole plate had 5, not good portions. My cod was bland, but the steak fries were good in my fish and chips meal. I also got a berry lemonade, which was really good, but the way the glass is shaped and all the ice packed in it was nothing for $5.

Had the Banzai Burger and it was decent, although impossible to eat without a fork and knife.  Upgraded to the sweet potato fries and they were underwhelming.  Beer selection could use a boost to keep up with the popularity of craft beers.  Servers were friendly and attentive.   The one negative thing that sticks out is their menu -- it is the most confusing spiral bound collection of laminated pages I have ever seen.  Be prepared to spend 10 minutes trying to figure out what your options are!

Red Robin, you GOT RID OF YOUR GARLIC PARMESAN FRIES. They were SO good. And then you tricked me by including ""garlic fries"" on the menu, which tasted like fries sprinkled with garlic powder and some cheese haphazardly thrown in. I asked my waitress if RR still makes the garlic parmesan one, and she said no, because they don't have the garlic butter that was on the fries anymore.  So I've only been to this RR once even though it's right by me, and there's good reasons for that. Last time I went I gave it 4/5 stars, which was 2 years ago, but I don't remember it being remarkable at all. This time, some out-of-town friends were here who like RR and I had a free birthday sandwich too, so I figured, why not. I ordered the teriyaki chicken sandwich with no lettuce, mayo, or cheese. (therefore, it still has the pineapple, teriyaki sauce, and tomato) My sandwich came out with cheese, sans tomato. I picked off the cheese. The ""new"" garlic fries are meh. To be fair, I'm not a steak fries fan in general (bottomless fries would be pretty cool at RR otherwise) but I used to LOVE their garlic parmesan fries. The new ones taste like they have a sprinkling of garlic and that's it.  It was happy hour and the waitress went over some specials with me. My table ordered the short stack of onion rings, which on the menu said $5, and I swear she said that it was on sale during HH ... but on the bill, it came up as $5. I asked about it and she said that was the HH price ... um, okay. The only reason I'm giving this RR 3 stars instead of 2 is that my sandwich was still tasty, and overall the service was good - my water glass was always refilled.

12,Jim O.,"Sterling Heights, MI",138,664,,3.0,2016-11-07,Lunchtime today!  Was ok. Friend had a chicken sandwich and a coke. I opted for lunch value burger with endless fries and a draft beer. Now I know why they offer endless fries. Not very good at all. Burger was good.

20,C C.,"Detroit, MI",0,145,16.0,2.0,2017-01-17,"We often meet for lunch or early supper here because of the great location off I75 and Crooks in Troy. I don't usually review chain restaurants because most diners know them well. But at this location the table and food service are inconsistent quality for a chain. This means sometimes the burgers are not cooked as requested. Sometimes they don't ask. The burgers are always different. Sometimes they aren't as described on the menu. Sometimes the fries are soggy. Sometimes the fried cod fish is raw in center. Sometimes your server is MIA. Once we were seated at the bar and had to make a big deal because the bartender was supposed to be our server and no one told her that. Then again, sometimes all is acceptable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-troy?start=20,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
10,Laura D.,"Utica, MI",187,192,13.0,3.0,2017-01-22,My first time at red robin. It was really good but I guess I was expecting... more? The burger was in fact delicious and the service was great. The fries were particularly good with their campfire sauce. I ordered the irish shake and it was just ok... not great. Probably wouldn't get it again. Over it's just fine. I'd rather go to steak and shake.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-troy,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8
14,Petra J.,"Saint Clair Shores, MI",0,19,6.0,5.0,2017-04-05,"I'm giving 5 stars because of our server, Jake.  Friendly, professional, knowledgeable and funny!  He had a huge smile and seemed genuine. Too many servers are just phoning it in but he was definitely engaged in the service experience.    He introduced himself, pointed out features and didn't seemed disappointed when we ordered water but rather offered lemon.  Jake made sure to tell us everything that comes on the burger to make sure we wanted it all ... I heard him do the same at other tables.  The food was fine, the same as all the other RR I've been to so I feel the difference is the people.   The hostesses were friendly on the way in and the way out.   Not one complaint for the entire experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-troy,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92

1,Robert P.,"Detroit, MI",310,136,1507.0,2.0,2017-07-02,"So I decided to come in here as they offer a free burger any day during the month of your birthday. They don't allow you to choose from the specialty burgers but the selection is pretty wide so there are a lot of things to fit your taste. I went with the Blue Ribbon which comes with blue cheese crumbles, onion straws, chipotle aioli, steak sauce and on an onion bun. I did like the burger as it was something that I had never tried before. I wouldn't say it was a knock out burger but for my first time at Red Robin and for free I couldn't complain. One cool feature is that the fries are refillable which is nice if your hungry and lite on cash but overall I wouldn't recommend Red Robin the food quality is very subpar and for the price you may as well go to another chain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-troy,2.92,2.92,2.92,,2.92

The restaurant had looked to have been remodeled and was very bright and clean. Our waitress was great! She was on top of everything, making sure we never had empty drinks (which is huge to us). But most importantly they cooked my husbands burger correctly! He is very particular in the way he likes it cooked and no matter where we go (even burger joints) they never seem to get it quiet right. Definitely earned 5 stars in my book, they saved me from listening to him complain all night! Lol",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-troy,3.36,3.36,3.36,,3.3600000000000003

So when they fail to promptly replenish the fries, it takes away any reason this place should exist. We have really tried to like this place.  First visit several months ago: Order burgers, which come out with a few fries. We immediately ask for more fries, but they don't appear until after we are already done with our burgers.
