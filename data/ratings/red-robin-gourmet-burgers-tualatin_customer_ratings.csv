Clam Strips, Cod fillets, Shrimp and of course fries... with some cole slaw as well.  Service was great.  It appears to be a smaller footprint restaurant than I've seen for Red Robin but that was good. We sat in the Bar, which would not have been my first choice but it felt really nice... I'll ask for it next time... a nice booth in the back. Mud Pie was... well... mud pie... YUM..

Located at the old ""Jiggles"" location a Tualatin landmark, this historical site is perfect to host this new establishment rich in such history for the locals. The burgers and service are similar to that of other Red Robin chain establishments, but what makes this location special is its legendary history of ""Jiggles"" one of the State's very first strip clubs and oldest around.

The hostess didn't even look up at us when our party of 6 walked in, just asked how many were eating. While waiting 10 minutes for our table a disabled elderly man walked through the doors and literally fell in the entry way and the hostess did NOTHING! I couldn't even believe it! She just told him where his wife was and let him walk by her incredibly embarrassed. Our server was nice but did not remember some of the things we ordered. After getting our food with cold fries I literally waited a good 15 minutes for him to come back and check on us before asking again for sauce. There didn't seem to be any management walking around, as you wood expect at a new restaurant, and they were severely understaffed. Needless to say we will not be back!! Update***  The GM contacted me and apologized up and down for our experience. She let me know that they handled the situation with the man who fell and the hostesses attitude as well. She let me know she appreciated my feedback and was very kind to send me a gift card and coupon for our experience. We will be back to see if we have a better experience and it's great to see that they care about their customers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tualatin?start=20,1.9280000000000002,1.9280000000000002,1.9280000000000002,1.9280000000000002,1.9280000000000004

We didn't wait long for our burgers, which were delicious and made just right. I would give 5 stars, but I had an issue with the tortilla chips we got. Some were very chewy (as if they got wet or something and then reheated) and we found one chip that had guac  on it. We know it wasn't us because it was about in the middle of the stack.

The comfortable booths and tables on different levels with old, funky pictures and certain Hollywood relics?

25,Jennifer S.,"Portland, OR",670,562,1975.0,3.0,2016-11-07,"FOOD: We ordered a kid's meal and an entree. The food was good. I love the fact that they have bottomless sides. I think they have pretty decent sweet potato fries, and the fact that I can have as much as I want is fantastic! I seem to always order one of two entrees and sweet potato fries. My son always asks for the grilled cheese and fruit. He loves the fruit, and the kid's sides are bottomless, too! ATMOSPHERE: It's a regular chain restaurant. It has random stuff hanging all around. There are some cool pieces. It is definitely a place you can play ""I Spy"" with your older kids. It was clean. The place wasn't too busy. SERVICE: One of the employees seemed to be going around and giving stickers to the kids. My son really enjoyed that, and he wore the sticker for the rest of the day. Our server was nice and friendly, but I have to say that he was overly attentive. Weird, right? Usually, it's the opposite! I have never had a server come to my table as much as this guy.

29,Rachel D.,"Portland, OR",17,120,116.0,2.0,2017-02-28,"I really feel like Red Robins has consistent bad service at every location. It seems to take way longer than normal to get food, its 50% the time cold when it comes out, and service seems to just be bad in general. Which is sad because red robins food is always delicious and fries (heart eyes) which is why I keep coming back- when will I learn!? I was very disappointed in my service I received. We meet my aunt and uncle for lunch around 1pm here and it seemed like it might have been pretty slow. The server was very nice, however service was bad. My uncle ordered a monster milkshake and they only brought us out a small one, which we corrected and the server argued about what he really ordered, but then brought out the extra later. My husband ordered a small beer (I think was the 12 or 16 oz?) They brought him out the huge 20 oz (which really who cares more beer, right?) but he didnt end up bring it out until we were about half way done with our food and charged us for the big guy.  Then there is the food.. I get the same thing every time I go to red robin. Whiskey river BBQ chicken wrap. Thats what I ordered, but im not sure what I got? It was chicken and cheese wrapped in a tortilla. THATS IT! No sauce or anything else on it at all! I think I just got the wrong order possibly? But the server never came back after he gave us our food- just to drop off the beer in a hurry and not stop to let me say anything.  My aunt got a Wedge salad and they forgot to bring her out a knife to cut it- and it was like every single server disappeared because there was no one to ask for one for the rest of our meal, we just got up and got it ourselves after a while (which is fine) but still you know? I ended up just eating my food because no one ever came back for me to correct it and felt weird saying anything when he brought up the check since I did eat it all. Also I had a free burger on my rewards but the server didnt put any of my information in since our table was the only one without the handheld device on it. And then it was too late since he ran the card already? ugh I just wanted to leave so I didnt make it a big deal  But never any refills on water or fries or sauces. Just wanted to have a good time while my relatives were in town but it was just stressful more than anything.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tualatin,,,,,

Service was bad, food was awful, restaurant was dirty...and why do they all smell like a sticky daycare center? My biggest complaint was that we were abandoned without silverware until our food was cold - if it was busy I could understand.

My family and I visited this location for the first time tonight. The food was cold and took forever to arrive. We asked for more fries and they came out undercooked. We asked for another round. Before they were handed to us the server said they were still undercooked. I feel like it's not the servers fault. Obviously they weren't running the food out fast enough and not cooking it right.

12,Brian Z.,"Tigard, OR",0,1,,1.0,2017-05-14,"By far the worst Red Robin location I have ever been to. Started off with being told it would be a half an hour wait. That's fine it's Sunday and Mother's Day. Then an hour later we finally get seated... next we ordered our drinks and appetizers. They brought out the wrong drink for my son. Then our appetizers came out, chips and salsa and fried pickles. There was only enough chips on the plate for about 2 people, the bowl wasn't even half full and the fried pickles looked as tasted like they were in the Fryer for way too long. They tasted like grease. We ordered our food and an hour later it came out cold and looked like it had been sitting under the heat lamp for a long time. My wife burger looked like a piece of charcoal and everyone else's food was lukewarm. They asked if my wife wanted a new burger? No she wants to eat this dried piece or charcoal on her plate. Of course she does. 20 minutes later she finally got her food. After everyone else had eaten. I decided not to eat since my food was cold and I was already disgusted by our service and food. To top it off, not once was I or anyone else asked if we wanted another drink. They actually charged us $75.10 to sit and eat that crap. On my way out I told the manager what had happened and he just looked at me in amazement, like he couldn't believe what I was saying. I don't expect much from chain restaurants but at least have some consistency for crying out loud. I wish I could put no stars or negative stars as a rating.

She ordered a chicken burger that normally has a tomato style sauce on it and asked to sub it for a garlic sauce. I ordered my burger with no tomatoes as well as I just don't normally like them. My daughter ordered a 9 piece corn dog nuggets meal. The time to get our food was normal for a lunch time.  My wife's meal came out with the tomato sauce on it and missing the bacon. My daughter was given only 5 corn dog nuggets vice 9 and my meal also had tomatoes on it as well. When we noticed this we called the waitress and she was shocked that this happened. She took my wife's meal back to fix it and said they would bring more corn dogs. I wasn't really worried about mine and just tossed the tomatoes to the side. I did have to ask for silverware and napkins to be brought to our table.  About 5 min went by and then the manager came to our table and said that he was going to discount our meal 50% off due to the problem in which they did discount our final bill. I asked for my wife's meal to go and we left when it arrived.  I'm more upset about the allergy not being recognized and the possibility of spending the rest of our weekend in the emergency room had we not looked at her meal first. Our final receipt even stated allergy alert on it. I will not recommend this restaurant to anyone I know nor will I be returning myself.

The manager was less than sympathetic. He did bring over fries right away when we were (finally) seated. That didn't impress us too much since all the meals come with unlimited fries. Food was ok.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tualatin,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6
22,David F.,"Woodburn, OR",62,25,39.0,5.0,2018-01-03,"Eaten at this location about 6 times and I've never had a bad experience. It is a little smaller than most other locations, I've seen. Clean, music selection is good and the service is great. The employees have always been accommodating and happy and the food is on par with other locations, no complaints. Normally, I would probably give this restaurant a 4-star review, but I can't believe some of the negative reviews I've seen here! Especially a certain food allergy review written in November.. Their food came out with the tomato on it, but the server apologized and got it fixed as quickly as possible PLUS the manager apologized and took 50% off! That's called good customer service.. mistakes happen everywhere. It's simply what they do about it...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tualatin,2.76,2.76,2.76,,2.76
19,Teri C.,"Salem, OR",29,75,23.0,4.0,2018-01-13,"I am not a fan of Red Robin; but, my family is. The food was good and the service today was amazing.  Our server was attentive, responsive, and prompt. She kept us apprised of our food preparedness and any delays. She also was great with our children. My daughter devoured the Mac n Cheese and my son had a burger and fries. My spouse has the Wedgie Burger and it was too large for her to finish. The food was good, but the service made the rating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tualatin,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88
