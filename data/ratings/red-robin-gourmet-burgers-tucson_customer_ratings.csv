98,Julia R.,"Tucson, AZ",49,128,1.0,5.0,2012-04-04,"Sadly, I no longer live in this part of town, but every time we end up heading to the Tucson Mall, Husband and I stop at Red Robin. As far as we know, it's the only place  in town where you can get a ""Royal Burger,"" which is topped with bacon and a fried egg. Sounds weird, tastes YUMMY! (Make sure to ask for the egg to be a bit runny, otherwise it will be fried hard and lack the awesome ooziness that makes the burger so great.) The fry seasoning is also to die for on the regular fries, and the sweet potato fries with sea salt are unique and delicious. Burgers are huge, I can usually eat only half, so skip the appetizer! The service has always been just fine, even when things are a bit busy. Frequent enough to refill your lemonade when it's empty, but not enough to get annoying. Advice: rather than coming in directly through the entrance in the middle of the mall, head towards the exterior doors and come in the ""back."" That section is WAY quieter and you'll actually be able to hear your conversation! Overall, well worth the 30 minute drive from the SE side of town. Maybe we'll get lucky and they'll build one near Park Place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tucson?start=60,2.9960000000000004,2.9960000000000004,2.9960000000000004,2.9960000000000004,2.9960000000000004

I saw their pic for the new bacon melt burger and it looked heavenly....then when it came it looked not so heavenly:( Only if they can make a burger like how the picture it looks.  Our server had an off day so I'm not going to bash the restaurant for the service. We have been there off and on for a quick bite during football season to see a little football and had great service. Seems like you always have to be at the bar to get the service you need. My wifes salad was the worst she has ever had. The lettuce was sad and the dressing was garbage.  Come on Red Robin...get your act together!

I also got a bottomless rootbeer float, which was exactly what they said it was and more....it was so delicious I got a second one. And it was late and there were turning off the machines and our server gave us a third one (which he let me take home)! He also gave us two orders more of the bottomless steak fries, which we also had to take home because who can eat that much incredible food!!

BRENT SMITH was friendly, informative and  made no gluten mistakes at all. My meal was great, Chef's full gluten meal was also excellent. We later discussed each step of the meal and between us, we could find NOTHING even slightly questionable. Chef and I both agreed it was one of the best meals ever.

We showed up on a Thursday night at 5:30 and totally expected to wait but we were told the wait would be 10 minutes. 30 minutes later we got seated and we waited another 10 minutes for someone to come to our table. We were then informed when the waiter brought our drinks that they were out of ice so we were stuck with luke warm tap water. He seemed unapologetic. I ordered chili and my husband ordered a burger, we waited about another 30 minutes for our food. When the food arrived, they forgot his side of bbq sauce he requested and since our waiter disappeared, we had to ask another server for the bbq sauce. Nobody returned to our table and we had to waive down our waiter for the check. It was not until that moment that he offered to refill our empty water glasses. We saw that he was serving 4 other (small party) tables but then would disappear into the back. Normally I'd chalk it up to a bad waiter but the entire staff appeared to be unorganized and uninterested in being there.

Flavor: It was ok, if not a little plain. I took a bite without any condiments or extras and it was just ok. With the fresh sides, it definitely brightened but the patty wasn't the star.  3. Meat to bun ratio: Perfect, everything was finished at the same time. Also, each bite featured a proportional amount.  4. Included extras (veggies / condiments): lettuce, tomato, dill pickles, red onion.  5. Price: $8.99 (comes with fries).  Grade: B = Really good.

30,Shelly T.,"Tucson, AZ",15,59,19.0,4.0,2016-07-01,"This is my first time eating here ever. Red Robin was open until 10 which is cool because I work late.  I like the idea of bottomless fries. I tried the garlic Parmesan fries. They were so good! Super garlicky and buttery and delicious! The potatoes were very good quality so I'll give them that. Get these fries they are worth the dollar! There was options for extra dipping sauces. I tried the Thai sauce......it was just sweet chili sauce and the cup was really small. Certain menu options (like their alcohol portions, I'll get to that) are misleading to the size. The sauce cup was smaller than a ketchup cup. And it was a dollar. Not worth it.  Let me be the first to congratulate you on being the first business in Tucson that legit made a mushroom Swiss burger correctly. Those mushrooms were packed on and cooked perfectly and best of all, not from a can! I can't believe how hard it has been to find a mushroom burger with real mushrooms or at least more than like 3 with some cheese. So I was excited. They have a gluten free bun option for $.49 more as well and that is always a plus for me.  I ordered the Chile Chile Cheese Fries as an appetizer and those were also cooked to perfection! They had thick slices of jalapeno peppers but they weren't too hot and it had bacon and just yum! The only reason I gave it a 4 star was the service. It was about 9 when we went in and service was slow. I'd agree with the other reviews that the bottomless fries were not offered as well which made me sad because that really seems like a selling point to me.  I also asked if they had a house margarita and they served me the most expensive one on the menu. The picture advertised a tall margarita that looked delicious and I got a tiny glass. Maybe 6 ounces after all the ice. And it tasted like the margarita that is left over after you drank the whole thing and the ice watered down the last sip. This is mainly due to who ever mixed our drinks because my fiance's mixed tea was super watered down too. It wasn't worth $8. Not even in a bar. The second round of tea was much better though.  Also the waitress was really nice but there were no suggestions made and I was kind of mad that she just ordered me the most expensive margarita they had when ""house margarita"" generally means cheap. I felt a bit rushed but I won't let it ruin my review. I'll give it another shot.  I was more impressed by the food than anything though I did like the decor. Pictures of famous people on the walls and interesting art.  And finally the tea! (Couldn't leave that out). Their glasses were gigantic! Free refills and ice cold. The tea did need some sweeter because it wasnt super fresh but it was nice and strong like I like it. My cup was never empty so all in all 4 stars for me.

57,Steve P.,"Tucson, AZ",0,6,1.0,1.0,2016-07-30,"Took my family to Red Robin for lunch, at the Tucson Mall, this past Friday (July 29, 2016). There is a mall entrance and a parking lot entrance. We entered the mall entrance as we prefer the ambiance in that dinning area. We were told there was a wait and we'd have to go to the parking lot entrance to put our name in. However, no less than 40% of the tables were unoccupied. I asked how long the wait was and the mall entrance hostess couldn't say. I was again told to ask at the rear of the restaurant. I then asked for the Manager. After waiting some time, I was informed that Brent, the Manager, was in the kitchen and said he's not coming out. We then went to the rear of the restaurant. The hostess there, Karlie, had a smart mouth. Although I saw several parties waiting for a table ahead of us. Karlie told me no one was waiting for a table. (It felt like a scene out of ""The Emperor's New Clothes"".). We put our name in, and were seated about five minutes thereafter. It took about 40 minutes before our food arrived. With a Manager who can't be bothered to come speak to a customer, and a Hostess who tells you the sky is colored Orange - I for one can think of many other restaurants that seem more interested in their customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tucson?start=40,3.48,3.48,3.48,2.244,3.4800000000000004

I'm definitely glad that we did!  I hadn't been to Red Robin in a few years, and I've since gone vegan so I was interested to try out their veg-friendly options. My boyfriend and I both had the gardenburger with the boca patty, with sides of black beans and steak fries. We also split the Sweet Potato Fries as an appetizer. I got a freckled lemonade as well, and the total only came up to about $25 after tax which is a pretty good deal, in my opinion.  The food was phenomenal, and I would definitely say it was one of the best veggie burgers I've had in a restaurant. The servings were a little on the bigger side (even though I feel like they used to be larger back in the day) and neither of us could finish all of our food.  The place wasn't too busy because it had just finished pouring rain, and we were seated right away. It took a little bit for us to get our food, but it wasn't an issue for us. The server was very helpful and even explained all of the different vegan options we could try next time, which I appreciated.

First of all I had my baby in a stroller and when it was our time to be seated instead of the hostess taking us around to the main entrance to be seated she made me get through the stairs with my stroller to only sit us right in front of the big main opening. It was a struggle to move around peoples tables and I kept bumping into people while they where eating just to get my stroller through and she just stared at me when she could have walked us around to save the hassle!  2) The bathrooms where disgusting!! I went to change my baby and there was wet toilet paper all over the floor, trash was over flowing and the toilet seat was filthy and had a wet toilet cover cover hanging off of it.  3) Where we sat at it smelled like really old urine. We could not enjoy our dinner because it smelled so terrible near us like it was coming from the floor. 4) I asked the waitress for water and she gave me tap water and I nearly threw up once I drank it.  5) Pictures where falling from the wall!! If a picture would have fallen and hurt me or my daughter I would have sued red robin!  6) and lastly, our waitress sucked! She really seemed to not want to be there.

We've been going to Red Robin for about 16 years and have never received such terrible service as we did on this last visit! We checked with a hostess about sitting in the bar area and were told that it was open seating.  Once at the bar a young waitress disrespectfully told us that we couldn't sit there as it's an adult area.  I asked why's that as we've always sat there before?  The waitress then actually opened her eyes and shut her mouth to see that my wife of 37 years was not a child.    I requested the bartender over to explain the rudeness of the young waitress and received no satisfaction of correcting the waitress on conduct. We then ordered two hamburgers, one medium and one well done.  Evidently even that was too much for them as they both came out rare.   We returned one hamburger to the kitchen and then the manager delivered the replacement hamburger.  She asked us to cut it at the table so she could INSPECT it?? After talking with the unresponsive manager, we left disappointed.   Red Robin's quality of service and food has declined so bad that we won't be returning.   What a disappointing lunch and experience!  After talking with 3 of the 4 people we dealt with I felt that they were all unaware how bad their quality of service and food has become.  Save your money and do yourself a favor and find a different restaurant!

Well I don't usually write reviews unless I've had a bad experience or a really awesome experience. Today was a bad experience. First and foremost, I'm pregnant & these cravings are insane!!  I was craving garlic fries from RR so we drove 40 minutes just so I can be happy lol (my poor husband!) Anyways, the host sat us down at our table & the waitress (Candice) comes by, introduces herself & that she'll be right back...maybe 7-9 minutes later she takes our order. Good job on the wait time  We start to order our food, I go first: Me: Can I have a Whiskey Bbq Burger with garlic fries please. Oh and also on a lettuce wrap (need to save room for them carbs).  Her: How do you want it cooked? Pink or no pink? Me: No pink & can I also have malt vinegar? & try the Buzzard sauce. (which btw was not a good sauce to try) Her: Vinegar?! **gives a disgusting look** Well alright. Me: haha, its my cravings. (But in actuality I love malt vinegar with my fries, it's like having salt & vinegar chips) *atm I'm feeling uncomfortable but able to joke around about what I ordered* My husband tells her what he wants & she says ""at least you didn't order your meal with vinegar"". I laughed because maybe she was just joking.  NOOOPE!!! I was wrong. Here's what went down...food arrives --it wasn't a very long wait, so yay for fast service -- and we started eating. Halfway through our food and the waitress comes by to check on how we are doing. & this woman, THIS FRICKEN WOMAN!!! had the audacity to act like she's gagging in front of my husband and I while we were eating & saying ""ugh! That smell!"" I actually looked at her and rolled my eyes because I found that very disrespectful. You guys don't know how pissed off I was & how I can really get when I'm being disrespected. After she left my husband said that was uncalled for. I totally agreed. The whole night at the table, no refills on water, mistaken order on fries I was really furious at her action. I didn't want to touch my fries because I felt uncomfortable about other people's thoughts on the malt vinegar smell. It didn't seem to bother anyone but her. Got our check & I wanted to pay for it because if my husband did he'd probably leave her tip she doesn't deserve. We usually tip 15%. NOT TODAY! She's lucky I even tipped (only $2) she doesn't deserve shit for the way she acted today. I wasn't gonna give her shit but people need to make a living somehow.  Anyways, got the receipt & spoke to the manager privately because I'm not the type to complain or make a big deal in front of people. He kept trying to give me a refund, but I told him it's alright, I'm here a lot. Just please talk to her about her actions. She can't be doing that in front of customers. I teared up because I was pissed.   Tip:  DON'T get Candice as a waitress if you like malt vinegar with your food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tucson,2.8,2.8,2.8,,2.8

Our waitress comes by to take our order, and at no point mentions that the kitchen is over an hour behind on orders.  We expect to be in and out at a hamburger joint.  We have to repeat our order about three times each, because she cannot hear us.  During the next 1 hour and 15 minutes, she only comes by twice to ask if we want refills.  On the second visit, we ask how we have not yet gotten our food.  We did not get an appetizer because we were in a hurry.  At that point she checks with the kitchen and says they are about to START cooking our food.  10 minutes later she says they had to remake ours because they forgot to add the tomato aioli, which we never wanted; she wrote it down wrong.  She goes to the kitchen to inform them of this, so they have to remake a third time.  It was over 1.5 hours by time we got our food.  When it was time to pay she asked why WE were giving her attitude.  We told her this is the worst service we've ever gotten at a Red Robin.  Instead of apologizing, getting her manager, or crediting our bill, she argued back that HER service was fine and that she has no control over how busy they are.  It's not that they are busy, but rather that this entire establishment is poorly run, hires rude employees, and makes no effort to provide quality customer service.  I will not be returning and recommend you do the same.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tucson?start=40,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56

We paid the bill, and it had included my wife's incorrect burger.  I asked to speak to both a manager and Doris on our way out.  I explained how long we have loved Red Robin, our first bad experience at that location, and why I felt this experience was sub-par.  The manager never identified himself as a manager and then told me he was working front and back of the house, said sorry he wasn't wearing his sleeves, and that he was too busy to remember to take the burger off the bill, even though he meant to.  I asked if I could write a review that would help ID issues to corporate, and he said no since every location is franchised.  He said he was short staffed so needing to work both front and back of the house.   With the amount of food choices available in Tucson, with sub-par experiences like these two it makes it difficult for me to ever return to this location.  I don't want free offers or enticements to return, I honestly just would love for the Red Robin experience to be made available at this location.  How can we make this right?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tucson?start=20,2.68,3.18,3.18,,2.9800000000000004

29,Patrick M.,"Sahuarita, AZ",0,2,,1.0,2017-06-04,The bottomless fries were stale and old even the new set they brought back for us after we complained no manager ever came to the table our waitress could not be found so we had to have other people help us all I can say is very disappointed in the place that is supposed to be corporate and Gourmet Burgers won't be going back,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tucson,2.84,3.2,3.2,,3.0560000000000005
39,MIke L.,"Corpus Christi, TX",0,5,,4.0,2017-06-18,Was not disappointed!  Wait was less than 10 min and our server was great.  Fed 8 people and the food was perfect.  The wedge was fantastic as well as the cowboy.  Kids enjoyed with leftovers to spare.  Will stop again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tucson,2.88,3.19,3.19,,3.066
38,Lana T.,"Tucson, AZ",2,88,29.0,4.0,2017-06-18,The burgers are delish at red Ro in a nd their fries are tasty.   The smell of the restaurant can be better with the carpeted area in the mall side but the food is good.   The alcoholic drinks are made well and not watered down as u would expect.   All good and go there often.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tucson,2.92,3.19,3.19,,3.082
33,Jonathan T.,"Tucson, AZ",2,23,37.0,3.0,2017-06-19,"Me and my date waited about 20 to be seated. Not a big deal this location has recently announced its closing so we thought we'd go one last time. The waitress was very good and attentive considering there were people everywhere. She was great. The fries and mozzarella sticks were delicious as ever. I had to give 3 stars because although I didn't mind the wait we were told 10 mins and waited about 20, and my burger didn't have a lot of flavor to it. I ended up dipping it in ranch to get a different taste to it. The staff were great, and I love the Red Robin signature spice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tucson,2.92,3.17,3.17,,3.07
26,Steven L.,"Tucson, AZ",0,46,,1.0,2017-07-31,The only reason for bad review is that they CLOSED the Tucson Location.  Red Robbin had some great burgers for the price. R.I.P Red Robbin I hope you open a new location in Tucson.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-tucson,2.8,3.16,3.16,,3.0160000000000005
