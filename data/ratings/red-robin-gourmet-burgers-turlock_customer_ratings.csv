This is definitely not the staff's fault, they all serve you with courtesy and a smile, no matter how stressed they are, but employing two or three more waiters during rush hour sure wouldn't hurt. The worst part though is that it's insanely noisy, it's hard work to have a conversation there. Plus, the flat screen TVs hanging in every corner are really distracting, usually showing some sports.

I think I will be ordering one of the gourmet burgers every trip now because they are just so delicious and cure my craving for a juicy dose of red meat and fries :D The one downside during this trip is they had a very large birthday party seated near us when we came in, who left about 10 minutes later. The 4-5 tables for that group were left messy and unattended for the duration of our meal and it was just not very nice to see it all sitting there for so long without at least an attempt to clean it up.

Speaking of salt...Seriously? A salt grinder in a burger joint. The fries seemed like they had been in a heating drawer since morning. Soggy and tough skinned.

90,Jacob N.,"Sacramento, CA",22,41,4.0,4.0,2014-08-23,"I really enjoy Red Robin, it's hard not to. I've never ever left hungry due to their bottomless steak fries and gargantuan burgers.  It's not that I usually receive bad service, the Turlock branch usually does very well, but last night was the best service I've had at Red Robin, anywhere. Our server John was always accessible without hovering and whenever we needed campfire sauce or more fries they were brought to the table within a minute. I've never had service so fast. If any manager is checking Yelp, and they'd be foolish not to, they need to make sure they hold on to that man. The burger selection is huge, and I appreciate they offer most in a chicken version. But they are a bit pricey. And I don't know if it's me, but the patties are so thick that most burgers taste the same. I appreciate a smaller burger so I can actually taste what else is on there. My burger was so thick and had so many onion straws that I could hardly taste the Bleu cheese. Great job with the redesign, somehow it all looks bigger, and I especially like the partition separating the dining section from the waiting area.

This time I requested to speak with the manager to explain to her my current experience,  and past experiences. The thing that pushed me to write a bad review was the managers response.

My colleagues and I used to go to red robin so often and stopped for a few months. Just recently I've gone twice and each time was so bad. We usually don't complain but it was difficult not to! The fries were cold AND disgusting...The new version of garlic fries is a cheap version of the previous with garlic POWDER instead of actual garlic. They got my co-worker's order wrong twice and I had to ask for sauce 3 times before I got it. On top of that we were sitting in the bar area (as we usually do) and they normally play music which isn't a big deal. However, this time they were playing this really obnoxious wannabe rock type of music. That isn't the bad part, I can sit through bad music, the fact that I was watching this woman lying naked with Hershey kisses all over her body was what was disturbing to me. The channel they were using for the music was absolutely inappropriate for any restaurant. I think the bartender heard complaints so he turned of the music BUT he still kept the music videos up. Then we asked the waitress for a cake of some sort because we always go to red robin for birthdays or departing co-workers (our coworker was leaving us) and she said oh I don't know I have to ask...UMM HELLO WE DIDNT ASK FOR FREE CAKE NOW GIVE ME A DAMN CAKE.

In response, they sent me an email suggesting I check my rewards before before dining. There was no mention of the issue I had nor the server telling me the wrong information and charging me for something she said was free. This is NOT good customer service and I will NOT go to this Turlock restaurant again. In my opinion, don't bother filling out a survey or contacting customer service if you have an issue because they don't care.  ""Hello, I visited the Turlock Red Robin today. My waitress, Kristin, saw that I had a Red Card and told me that I qualify for a free shake. I normally don't order shakes but since my server said it was free if I spent $10, I ordered one to split with my friend. As the server dropped off my bill, she informed me that one of my sandwiches would be free since I was about to reach my 10th item. After leaving the restaurant, I examined my bill and noticed that I was charged for the free shake my server said I qualify for. One of my sandwiches was free, like Kristin stated, but I was charged $3.99 for my shake. I would not have ordered a shake if it was not free. I am not happy about ordering a ""free"" shake and then being charged for it. If it was not free, then my server should not have told me it was.

When we get shown back to the dining area we discover the dining room is one half full. Yes they're empty tables everywhere. The waitress comes and takes our drink orders and our appetizer order. Drinks and the appetizer come in a reasonable amount of time. We wait 20 minutes for the waitress to return to take our meal order. It takes almost 45 minutes for 3 hamburgers and fries to arrive. At the time that we ordered I had requested a side of ranch dressing for my fries. The ranch comes after we complete our meal. Throughout the entire meal we received no drink refills even though we flag down the waitress and requested refills. Another waitress comes with the ranch dressing and asked if we had ordered a side of ranch. I politely told her I had finished my meal already and no longer need the ranch dressing and that we were waiting for our check. The manager shows up at our table asking for feedback and she has heard we were unhappy with our meal. I politely explain to the manager our meal was fine it was the lack of service we take exception with. I then again politely ask for the check.

My family and I have been to Red Robin quite a few times over the years, but today was the first time in a long while. And it will be the absolute last.  First, we arrived to the restraunt, and there was no hostess at the front desk. We stood there for a minimum of five minutes with bartenders and servers walking by and smiling at us, but not one said they would get someone, or asked of they could help. Eventually a young man came, he told us the wait would be 15 minutes. It was 20, but hey things happen and we get that it's an estimate.  However, when we were seated, we were astonished to see that the dining room was less an 40% full. We sat down with our menus, and it was 7 minutes before anyone acknowledged us. Finally, our server came and took our drink, appetizer, and dinner order,as we had plenty of time to peruse the menu before she greeted us. After taking our order she told us we had to put the appetizer order in on the Ziosk, little IPad thing. While I'm pretty young, the women who were behind us were in there 60's and we're having a rough go of it! Finally our appetizer arrived after 15 minutes, but with no silverware? Because they didn't have any clean? But the restraunt, wasn't anywhere near capcity, hold on, what?  Could the dishes have been overlooked in the same manner that cleanliness of the floor was? So upsetting. So after we finished our appetizer, during which no silverware arrived, it took another 20 minutes for our three burgers to arrive. Which to our surprise, came with silverware. The food was fair to good in quality, but definitely did not make up for the service. I generally am a very very generous tipper, as I served tables through college, and know what a difference a couple extra bucks can make. But I left no tip. We all have our bad days, but unfortunately, I think the servers here always have bad days. I mean who could take pride in working for this sort of an establishment.  Please please save yourself the time and dissapointment. Very disatisfied! And for the record I read yelp anytime I'm out of town and am looking for a place to eat.

First let me explain to yelp users my experience. Red robins looks like Red robins, red, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ . The hosts were ok. They put yours formation down on the tablet and call your name when the tables ready. There's no pager or text or anything like that just a shout.  When we were sat, our server took our drink order when she arrived to the table and tells us if we want to order appetizers go ahead and order on the tablet at your table. So we did. She returned and took our main meal orders. On this tablet there are games you can play, like trivia, plants vs. zombies, just the apple/android games you can download on your tablet/phone. You can also check your bill and order dessert on the table.  I ordered the whiskey river BBQ chicken sandwich with sautéed mushrooms and fried jalapeño. Keep in mind it's $1.49 added to your tab.  The fried jalapeño, eh I should have gotten fresh jalapeño. The chicken sandwich was ok, i couldn't really taste the BBQ. The side of garlic aioli dressing I got was very good and garlicky.  Overall the food was ok.3 stars. But the issue with the tip was. I take my own appetizer order and/or dessert. She takes our main meal order. Brings drinks refills and someone else drops off the food (xpo) she brought our dipping sauces, napkins. And we check our own bill and pay with card at table, of we pay for cash, we hit the server button and she's on her way to pick up the cash. What else does she do? Basically I'm tipping out the bussers, food runners, and the little things our servers do.

54,The Bottomless Pi T.,"San Francisco, CA",104,413,696.0,3.0,2015-11-06,"Today I went to Red Robin for lunch.  I was in the mood for something besides a burger or a chicken burger.  I didn't want to graze on a salad, so that narrowed down my choices tremendously.  The one laminated page had some specials that were awfully pricey. I narrowed it down to a wrap, or the Crispy Arctic Cod Sandwich.  I opted for the sandwich.  For some reason it seems that the kitchen is always understaffed at the beginning of the lunch rush.  It took a really long time for our food to arrive, but the restaurant wasn't very full when we got our orders in.  From where I sat, I couldn't tell how many cooks were in the kitchen. My sandwich was excellent.  The cod wasn't overly breaded, and the fish didn't taste greasy either.  In fact it was so good I didn't notice the pickles in my sandwich.  I think it was because there were bits of pickles already in the tartar sauce.  I don't like pickles and normally take them out before I start eating.  I didn't notice this time, until a pickle fell out of my sandwich after I took a big bite. The only disappointing aspect of my meal was the fries.  The initial helping of bottomless fries was neither not nor fresh, and they were not crispy either.  They were rather mushy.  So I just put in an order for more fries the second after I bit into the first fry.  The second basket was hot and fresh, so I didn't touch my first helping of fries until I was done with the fresh ones. I really like how easy it is to split checks with the wireless tablets at the tables.  Just select your meal, swipe your credit card, add the tip, sign, and away you go!  I am sure the restrooms were cleaned before I entered, because there was strong smell of bleach in the air when I was washing my hands.  Service was not terrible and not great, just good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-turlock?start=40,2.04,2.84,2.84,2.444,2.52

Anyways terrible service and mediocre food.  They tried to make up by giving us fries to go. In a huge box. Why would I want them to go? My family and I wanted them with the meal.  It's not the first time I come here. But first time with horrible service.

However, Red Robin has gone way downhill, especially at this location. After giving them a last chance after a long time away after a bad experience, I think our family is finally giving up on the RR brand. *Hit or Miss Service. Sometimes we'd get a good server, but then there were servers like the one who brought out our child's mac n' cheese meal in the heating pack. She tore it open and poured it into the dish at the table. Sigh. *Miserly Portion Sizes -- yes you can get ""bottomless fries"". However, during our last visit, our server told us that  they aren't allowed to bring out fries before the meal is served, and the fries that come with the meal are roughly equivalent size to a small at McD's. Either you have to have Job's patience or a bird's appetite to enjoy the bottomless feature.  Whatever you do, don't get the chips & salsa. A total rip-off. Our kids were hungry, and we couldn't get fries before the meal (according to the server), so we ordered the $5 chips and salsa. We were served about 8 oz of chips in a teeny tiny cup and about 2-3 oz. of salsa in a teenier-tinier cup. *OK food. It's just that. OK. Habit's burgers are better.   They don't even stir the kid's chocolate milk. When you're shelling out $50 for a family meal, couldn't you even stir the milk?  *Noise Level: Bring your earplugs. It is way too loud in there. If you have kids, they'll almost certainly herd you into the insanely loud room in the back. If you don't have kids, you may have a shot at getting in the moderately loud room in the middle. or in the bar. *Wait Time: We usually had to wait a long time just to get a table.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-turlock?start=40,2.48,2.81,2.81,2.568,2.678

It's the little video device they casually drop at your table without telling you what it is, what it does and that it costs you $1.99. Kids can activate it without any restriction or parental approval. This little device that customers pay $1.99 clearly benefits RR. It not only generates a customer receipt right at the table which the server does not have to take time preparing and delivering it also advertises RR's various menu and dessert items. I think it is unconscionable that Red Robin charges its customers a $1.99 for the device. Gives the kids some free entertainment.  Just like crayons and paper.

I told the waitress and sent the food back. What really bothered me was that she didn't even seem surprised! She just said, ""Oh, sorry about that"" in a very bored and monotonous tone.

So we waited to be seated at the dinning area. I order a lettuce wrap with a gluten free bun and there was no lettuce in my burger. We order extra fries and it took a very long time to get them (15 min), but the couple that got to the restaurant after us got the fries right away. We asked to talk to the manager and he came to apologize for the experience and that he was sorry we where having a bad day, we never mentioned we were having a bad day, it had nothing to do with our day. It was the bad service and the long wait time that did it for us. He even said that some days are better than other and that the customer service sometimes is not as good as other days, what kind of business is he running.

4,Hai N.,"Turlock, CA",0,3,,1.0,2017-11-15,The service at this place is terrible. Every time we come here there are plenty of tables open and yet they make customers wait. Last time I come here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-turlock?start=20,2.48,2.61,2.61,,2.558
41,No T.,"Turlock, CA",1,15,,1.0,2017-11-15,"What a terrible place to eat. I went to Red Robin for the first time several years ago in AZ. I ordered a burger. It was dry and overcooked. Yuck! I said I would never go back. I am a veteran, and heard Red Robin was giving Veterans a free ""plain burger"" on veterans day. I figured I would take my family there(different state different restaurant)and get my free burger. We got to the hostess desk at 610pm. We put our name on the list and was told it would be ""at least an hour"". We went across the street to run an errand and was back in about 35 minutes. We were told that our name was called and we went to the bottom of the list. She was rude. I said to her I should be able to leave and come back if I'm told it would be over an hour. We ended up waiting almost 2 hours for a seat. It was terrible service. The food was mediocre at best. I definitely wont be back again. What a waste of time. They should get a phone number or something in case a table becomes available a half an hour earlier than what they are telling people. I actually asked the girl when we gave our name if they would call our name on the speaker outside or whatever and she said, No we will just come outside and look for you."" That's ridiculous. The Place was a madhouse. So, to add insult to injury...When we got to Red Robin, there were 4 cop cars. I asked what happened and was told that a customer attacked the server, and a fight ensued. I should have taken the hint that the service was bad. I don't think a fight was warranted, but it was bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-turlock?start=40,2.48,2.61,2.61,,2.558
22,Steven G.,"Merced, CA",65,203,1025.0,5.0,2017-11-18,"Arrived here 6:30pm Saturday night and it was a measely 5minute wait. They work fast here. Service is par excellence. The hostess was very welcoming. The burgers are definitely gourmet burgers. They serve unlimited sweet potato fries here! Kids pizza is hot and freshly made. Their onion ring tower is monstrous (see my photo) and it makes a great family appetizer.   They have lots of sauces here for your burgers but I personally like their ""campfire"" sauce. I forget the ingredients (ketchup, barbecue and something else?) but man alive is it delicious.  I easily recommend this restaurant location for family and friends who are looking for a great burger joint with great quality food and great service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-turlock,2.64,2.63,2.63,,2.6340000000000003
7,Hammy C.,"Atwater, CA",0,15,,3.0,2017-11-30,"The first time I went, the hostest seemed like a moody teenager. She seemed botherd just by our existence and her eyes looked as if they were rolling around every time someone stepped in. our servers name was Larry. He was AMAZING. He never let our drinks get even half empty and was friendly and very accommodating. He had our app out promptly and our food as well.The second time however, we were severely disappointed. Our first waitress was very pregnant, so we sympathized. The second one that came, since the first ones shift was over, was horrid. She took 15 minutes to check on us after the first one left. Her name was Brianna, I think. When she eventually brought our food there were hardly any fries. So we obviously finished them quick and repeatedly called for her. She never once asked if we wanted fry refils or drink refils  She passed us by 3 times. She looked to busy chatting it up with her coworkers. So  about 30 minutes after our food arrived when we were done  she finally showed up. So if we do go back, we'll be sure to go back during Larry's shift.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-turlock?start=20,2.72,2.65,2.65,,2.678
21,Ralph S.,"Modesto, CA",0,5,,4.0,2017-12-07,This place is actually really good. I always get the chicken wrap and it is always great.  One thing people may not know is that they have unlimited french fries. You just have to ask for them. I always do. The waiters/waitresses have always been friendly in the 10 years+ that I have been visiting. Most of them know me by name. Just a good local place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-turlock,2.84,2.67,2.67,,2.7379999999999995
3,Kai D.,"Kailua, HI",414,1,,5.0,2017-12-20,Excellent service by Angelina. She was an excellent server and made the experience at Red Robin very enjoyable. Really enjoyed our food.

27,Lydia L.,"Curtis Park, Sacramento, CA",21,5,2.0,1.0,2017-12-30,"The wait time is ridiculous. Waited for 50 minutes when we were told 25-30 min. At the 45 min mark we were told we were ""still waiting on one group to finish..."" they were rude, unapologetic and seated multiple groups of the same size that had arrived after us. Super disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-turlock,3.0,2.67,2.67,,2.8020000000000005
28,Tanya E.,"Sacramento, CA",0,1,,1.0,2018-01-05,"Horrible wait times. If you're hungry don't come here. It took us an hour to be seated and another 30 minutes for the waitress to take our drink order. People that came after us, had eaten and left and we were never helped. Such a waste of time spent here. This one is a disgrace to the armed Robin franchise... save your money and eat somewhere else.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-turlock,3.0,2.67,2.67,,2.8020000000000005
20,Rick P.,"Merced, CA",2,18,1.0,3.0,2018-01-06,I used to love this place. Food was good but service wasn't. Didn't look super busy but it took 5 minutes after we were seated to get any service.  Every time we wanted anything we had to ask more than once.  One waitress was pretty decent.

26,Melanie I.,"Tracy, CA",2,2,,4.0,2018-01-10,I can honestly say the Gordon blue burger is the very tasty. I give this a 4 star restaurant only because their food is a bit on the salty side.
