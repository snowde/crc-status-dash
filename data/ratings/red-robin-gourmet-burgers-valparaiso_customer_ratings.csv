We usually eat at the Merrillville location, but since we saw a movie nearby we decided to eat at this one. Once we told our server we wanted our burgers wrapped in lettuce and wanted a salad instead of fries, she let us know we can also have broccoli or carrots. She is the only server to tell us that so we came back again and we had the same server, who recognized us from the week before which I thought was nice.

Well after awhile we gave in ,even though at least the last 3 times we were disappointed, we went back again unfortunately. The staff is always friendly and attentive.  The problem is that the burgers are HORRIBLE ! TOTAL RIPOFF AGAIN.. I got my Burning Love burger and it was soggy and cold . I sent it back to be microwaved also the burger was maybe a quarter inch thick .the fries had so much salt on them they were not edible. My wife's wasn't any better but she didn't complain..we actually never complain we just don't go back..once again we walked out after paying $42 . On the walk through the parking lot I was telling her that was the worst meal I've ever had. .that we would have been more satisfied by going to Wendy's or even White castle..Never again Red Robin !

Restaurant looks very clean and busy enough for a Monday afternoon. Tower of onions rings are delicious. Ordered precisely as we asked, a little crispy. Pretzel bites have beer cheese filling. Though I didn't try them the others seemed to enjoy them. Food ordered Basic Cheeseburger, Blt croissant with fruit salad side instead of fries,  cluck and shrimp, bacon cheeseburger and.  Everything was perfectly cooked. Not a complaint at the table.  Endless fries with the burgers but the burgers are so filling no one asked for 2nd on the fries! Fruit salad was too sweet for my liking but the apple was nice and crisp. Blt turkey croissant was very good and the avacodo slices on it gave it just a little bit more flavor.  Croissant was fresh too. Our family of 6 is very happy with our visit today.
