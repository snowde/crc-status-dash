I have only been once since I moved to Van and me and my friend were haggard as shit after a hard night of being fabulous. We wanted something greasy and good and I hadnt had a burger in months! We ventured in here and ate till out hearts content, everything was delicious and even had a mint chocolate milkshake to top it off, yum, yum. after a solid meal and a few drinks my hangover magically disappeared. Not that its only good for hangovers, im sure burger and fries lovers would enjoy the quality food anytime. I just only happen to eat food like this when im hungover so thats my story and im stickin to it....like the onion rings in my stomach.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vancouver?start=100,3.732,3.732,3.732,3.732,3.732

It sits in a niche that I'm more comfortable with - not trying to be all hip & happening like Cactus Club, Earls, etc. The atmosphere is warm and friendly, and it serves a good burger - what's not to like? A surprise winner on the menu is..... *drum roll please* French Onion Soup!!! It's a strong competitor to FOS served at fancy shmancy French restaurants, and in fact, better than some.

53,Theresa W.,"Mississauga, Canada",114,546,395.0,4.0,2012-03-12,"Oh man, if you knew how many calories were in a burger, you'd be sad-faced too. But if you can look past that, Red Robin is a delicious burger joint and well worth the $10 meal.  Located in the busy area of Robson & Thurlow, this place is great for people watching - especially with a bottomless freckled lemonade if you're up for the $5 splurge. And for a share starter, nothing brings more delight to the eyes of old and young alike as the onion ring tower (campside bbq sauce is the best!).  Burgers here are DELISH. The menu has several staples (including the Royal Robin burger with a fried egg), but my favourites are the bonzai, california, or whiskey river burger. Service here is awesome as well, they add onion straws to my burger at no extra charge and they can bring it out on a plate and cut in half for you if you know you'll be taking some of it home. Bottomless fries (the fatty kind though, I'm more a fan of thin fries), or a side salad (not bottomless) completes your meal. Those not looking for beef can also choose from the veggie patty options, or the chicken or salmon burgers. Or if you're really not feeling burgers, they've got salads, fajitas, chicken fingers, and more.  The place is big, roomy, but really busy during lunch on the weekends. I recommend this place to visitors who are looking for some regular burgers or fast food. :) It's a safe option every time, and good value for a filling meal in downtown.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vancouver?start=60,3.4,3.4,3.4,3.3120000000000003,3.4000000000000004

So much to choose from and you always get bottomless fries with it. By the way the fries are great too. :-). You get your Burger in a little red basket which is really lovely. My favorite is the Burger with a beef patty, sautéed mushrooms and onions. Delicious! You can make all the Burgers a Monster by adding another beef patty.

It's consistently delicious and an absolute must if you're craving the chicken fingers/burger and fries sort of meal. All meals with fries come with ENDLESS FRIES. That's right, ENDLESS FRIES. Be prepared to take in billions of calories, but I'm telling you that it's worth it.

49,Carol L.,"Vancouver, Canada",118,344,8.0,4.0,2012-11-02,"Red Robin calls for no occasion. Could you ever go wrong with burgers, Steak cut fries and smoothies? Probably not.  Up a flight of stairs, tucked away in a dodgy corner from a fast take-out White Spot is our downtown Red Robin. Despite it's unimpressive entrance, the interior makes every adult feel like a not-so-grown-up adult again! All the times we've been there, the service has been quite fast. Even during rush hours and special holidays, the seating moves reasonably quickly. A new discovery made here during my last visit is that reservations are welcome. The no-reservations impression must have come from somewhere, but it is gladly mistaken.  The most impressive burger by far, in my opinion, has to be the Whiskey River BBQ Burger. That is with the exception that your taste buds agree completely with BBQ sauce. Loaded with onion straws -- my favourite! -- and smothered with smokey, sweet BBQ sauce, the Whiskey River is the burger to try if you have not! The rest of the burgers on the menu are probably exceptionally delightful in their own way, but I can only tell so much about the one burger because I am boring like that; I get the same burger every time.  The next highlight is bottomless fries. Not just any fries... Steak cut fries! They have this Red Robin house seasoning on every table that is to kill for. The seasoning is a red-ish colour, contained in a Red Robin shaker bottle. Some may disagree with my verdict, because the smell and taste of the added spices are quite strong. Here's another tip: Honey Mustard with Poppy Seeds!!! I am a sucker for sauce. I love sauce. Very much. This has got to be the best honey mustard I've ever tasted! Be it the poppy seeds or simply my sauce addiction, we can all agree that you have GOT TO TRY IT!  It's a shame they stopped giving away the humongous slice of dessert for birthdays now. It was a treat for everyone to visit on their birthdays and be humiliated, standing on a chair while they announce your age to the entire restaurant, all in the spirit of knowing that there's a huge slice of dessert at the end of the tunnel.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vancouver?start=60,3.64,3.64,3.64,3.12,3.6400000000000006

Our usual waiter, Arlo, had been promoted to a manager, so we ended up with someone different this time. Arlo saw us and came by to say hello. He noticed that we were a bit upset (nothing to do with Red Robin), and after our meal, he brought us something to cheer us up.

A few min lator he came back, took my money and said it'd be a few minutes. He then went back to doing whatever he was doing.

It helped dilute the drink a bit which i very much appreciated. When we ordered our food our server was very keen to give us suggestions and was helping me decide what to eat, he was very knowledgeable about the menu. And the food came out SO quick! He was very attentive too. When our fries were looking a bit empty he offered to go get us some more and came back very shortly with a big basket of the bottomless fries.

The fries are still good and their tartar sauce is amazingly good. It tastes pretty close to McDonald's tartar sauce. The cheesecake is fabulous though they are stingy with the fruit topping. We also ordered the mud pie, which was not good. They've changed it. It no longer has peanut butter on it.  It's just icecream and chocolate.

27,Evan K.,"Vancouver, Canada",129,128,135.0,3.0,2015-08-28,"Thank you to Simon S for the heads up on RR's birthday club.  I came for a meal this week before the Whitecaps game with coupon in hand for my free b-day burger. This was my first visit to any Red Robin, and I found the place filled with families.  You have to walk up some steps to get to the restaurant, but it is quite visible from Robson street.  As you crest the steps you'll be in their patio area, which is quite large, and just through the doors takes you into the main dining area. Service was a little cold to start as there wasn't anyone to greet me, and I had to wait a few minutes before someone came over.  They have several TV screens inside but they are all small and not viewing friendly.  As much as I wanted to watch the Jays game, I opted for a seat on the patio instead.   My server came over quickly to introduce herself and detail the drink specials.  Of note, the $4 Shocktop cocktail sounded particularly good.  She took my coupon and showed me which burgers on the menu were eligible for the promotion.  I appreciated her genuinely helpful suggestions to help make up my mind.   No more than ten minutes after I'd ordered, my salmon burger arrived.  I liked the presentation of the meal.  The two burger halves were separated and on one of the buns there was a large dollop of coleslaw and red onion.  It's supposed to have tartar sauce and cilantro-lime dressing, but I couldn't really taste them. I wished the burger had more of a distinct flavour, as the plain salmon was what shone through - the burger was just OK..  As for the fries, they were aesthetically pleasing and nicely salted but strangely they were not all the same temperature nor were they all that fresh.  It was a small serving of fries, maybe only  fifteen or twenty at the very most,.  I would have ordered more had the waitress come to ask as they do advertise ""bottomless steak fries"" with their meals. The waitress was wholly absent after serving the meal.  My coupon might explain that, or perhaps it was getting busier inside.  I was a little surprised given how warm and friendly she was before I'd placed my order.  I found the patio nice and quiet, but for the 'safe/inoffensive' music playing quietly on the speakers and the traffic driving past. I'll admit - I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants to begin with.  Overall, I found Red Robin to be nothing fancy.  I probably wouldn't take a date there for anything other than a drink or two, and certainly it wouldn't be my first choice to impress.  It seems like a safe choice for families looking for a decent sit-down meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vancouver?start=20,3.24,3.24,3.24,3.0520000000000005,3.2400000000000007

As a single, I was asked if I wanted to sit at the bar which was fine by me. Little did I know it would take 10 minutes for the bartender to even get to me to take my order. A little too much chatting up the waitresses.  Finally came and took my drink order. I have a a think for salted caramel so I couldn't resist their salted caramel shake. I wish I had. They've got the salted part down a little too well, but if I hadn't seen the drizzle for caramel colored syrup on the top, I would never have guessed this was supposed to be a caramel shake.  My burger took another 15 minutes to arrive and it was pretty good. The place is well located (off Robson) although it takes a little work to find the stairs that lead to the second floor venue.

Our food did take a bit long but it tasted better than the last and possibly better than the first time I tried RB. We came for the Tavern Tuesday which is buy two beverages and a burger, entree or entree salad and get a double double tavern burger free.  We ordered: Popping purple lemonade (3/5-$4.69): They use their famous tornado glass to serve this drink and it was pretty. I'm not a huge lemonade fan but it'll do. It's more on the sweet side than sour. Raspberry syrup is used, hence the purple. Raspberry cream soda (3.5/5-$4.69): A bit sweet but it liked that they actually add some whipped cream with a cherry on top.  The big sky (4/5-$17.69): A bit pricey but it tasted   was served in a ciabatta bun, had an onion ring, bacon, the patty and goat cheese. Not sure if I missed anything else that was in there. It's a bit smaller than I expected too.  Bleu Ribbon (4/5-$12.69): My go to burger at RB. Didn't know blue cheese would go so well in a burger. But I remember requesting for blue cheese in my burger elsewhere and it was awful so RB it is if I want this kinda burger.  Double Double Tavern (3/5): Reminds of a McD cheeseburger but then again I haven't had McD since I was a kid so.....this is how far my memory goes. Not a bad burger. You do get double patties. Not sure if it's worth the deal though. You might as well get this if you plan to order drinks and you don't mind simplicity.  --- First time: Onion Ring Tower (3/5): I know a lot of people raved about this but other than it's served in a tower, I didn't see or taste anything different from the onion rings at another place.  Mad Love Burger (2.5/5): Can't quite remember what was in this but it was limited edition and my friend decided to get this. All I remember was it didn't taste good and was on the dry side.

The fajitas came and they were over 60% onions ! The green peppers were actually grey, and the steak was awful. I could totally tell this came out of some sort of frozen package, it was defiantly not fresh - I guess this is the reason they couldn't take the onions out. When I told the server, she asked I I wanted to order something else. I did - and that too contained onions as well ! I was so mad at this point. A manager came over.

As I was feeling like I had had too much meat recently, I went for the Garden Burger which, sad to say, is just OK, and that's if you immediately take out the pickles so you don't just taste pickles. Do NOT come to Red Robin for their veggie burger even if you do a patty swap. For approximately the same price (sometimes LESS) you can get a way more interesting and tasty burger (but with a meat patty). Contrary to my way-back-when experience, to redeem my birthday burger all I needed to do was give them the phone number attached to my account and confirm which burgers were part of the promo. No fuss at all. However, my friend got the Veggie Fajita, and OMG it was totally not what we were expecting -- in a good way. Generous almost for-two portion for $14.99, and although they start you off with about 4 wraps, it is clearly not enough and you can get free refills. Veggies are cheap (it looked like mostly onions) and clearly they don't skimp on it maybe because they can. NON-alcoholic drinks are big-portioned and cheap! My Coconut Pineapple Smoothie was just $4.69 and pretty tall. Heck, even the water is jumbo sized so they don't even have to come around and refill it because you are unlikely to drink it down to even half. Cronuts are OK, though sweet and a bit oily-feeling so personally I don't like them much. The main thing about them though is they are light and airy. If you are thinking of trying them but feeling full, just get the short 4-stack and you'll be fine as there's no way they are gonna fill you up.

We just moved here from the Seattle area and are used to our local RR (in Redmond, WA). I was skeptical that this downtown site would be as good as our old hometown site that we know and love. We were pleasantly surprised: this RR was definitely as good or perhaps even better than our old hang-out in the States! We opted to walk the stairs to the outdoor patio deck, as it was a hot and sunny day. What a great outdoor venue up here! And our server was the nicest guy EVER (damn if I can remember his name, though. He was from Bellingham, WA, though, so we chatted a bit about  Seattle and Washington state).  We loved how our American RR rewards card (and all our points) were transferable/usable here in Canada, too. Much of the menu was the same (which is a good thing!), including their bottomless fries and refillable freckled lemonade. There was a lovely girl who kept bringing my kid more fries and lemonade before we even asked her. The server staff here was incredibly on the ball. (The only difference I recall on the menu was the addition of poutine here. My kids thought that SO cool! We didn't order it, though; it will have to wait for next time). Love the fact that they still offer the free birthday burgers here. Oh, and I opted to have a salad which was definitely larger and, dare I say it, better than the RR salads back in the States. (Our American RR restaurants ""updated"" their interiors and their menus the past few years and the salads were changed - not for the better, IMO.

18,Hadas G.,"Central, Vancouver, Canada",0,1,,1.0,2017-09-15,Sorry to say that but it was a horrible experience. One of the worst burgers I've ever had. We couldn't even finish it. It didn't taste like burger but like the toppings on it which had a very strong tastes. If you're looking for a good place for burgers do not try that one. Service was very nice though.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vancouver,3.48,3.53,3.53,,3.5100000000000002
4,Sammy Y.,"North Vancouver, Canada",53,42,98.0,4.0,2017-09-22,"#BringBackChainRestaurants!!!! Considering VanCity is very hippie-dippie with its obsession with organic, 'gluten-free', picture-friendly foods, good chain restaurants like RedRobin is dying out. Their burgers are great! The bottomless fries are thick & well-done! The bottomless FreckledLemonade is a classic! This used to be THE spot to go... now their burgers seem slightly smaller with an interior that's not properly maintained... sticky tables & unclean cutlery etc... But I have hope! The SriRachaDouble was excellent!!!! The service was friendly & the price is always decent!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vancouver,3.52,3.55,3.55,,3.5380000000000003
1,Vitor L.,"New Haven, CT",7,52,17.0,3.0,2017-11-04,"We've been here two times, the good was good in one of them and quite bad in the other.  Service and the atmosphere were always good. I really enjoyed the Smoke and pepper burger. On the other hand, the mushroom burger was very soggy and unappealing. My wife ate the gluten-free burger, which was just ok. Their GF bun is not too bad, but it's difficult to find a GF burger sauce.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-vancouver,3.48,3.53,3.53,,3.5100000000000002
