The food was cold; my burger wasn't made as i'd ordered it, and we had to wait way too long for refills on our drinks. Let's put it this way: there's a problem when your favorite part of the meal is the view from your booth (we did get a pretty great seat, at least).

143,Scott G.,"Fillmore, CA",0,38,,1.0,2012-07-05,"Usually the Red Robin Restaurants are a great place to have a quick lunch and a good hamburger.  This place is no exception as far as good food and quick service.  The problem yesterday was having to be seated in the bar even as there were tables available in the restaurant area adjacent to the bar.  The patrons in the bar had obviously been overserved alcohol and were loud and rowdy and quite vulgar.  We took about as much as we could take and asked to be reseated somewhere else.  The staff and the bartenders seemed to know these people quite welll and were taking part in making quite a few off color comments as welll as adding to the obnoxious noise factor.  We surmised that the loud and rowdy group might be off duty employees of the restaurant.   No manager around, no one seeming to care that these folks were over served and sloppy drunk.  This was at 4 PM in the afternoon.

It is a lot smaller than other Red Robin locations, but they do have a decent bar. The service is 50/50 and most times I come here, I feel like the servers are very childish and not very cordial. Food is good, tried their new ""tavern burgers"" which are two patties, but they are thinner than their normal size. Endless fries are always a delicious treat. We went around 9pm on a Sunday and they were already closing.

75,Liset B.,"Moreno Valley, CA",572,259,3587.0,3.0,2012-07-30,"This Red Robin is located inside the huge Ventura Mall, making it even busier due to the relentless foot traffic there. When we initially walked in, I asked for the booth that's right next to the huge carousel horse (for picture purposes - yes, I am a picture freak), but they gave me this complicated story as to why we couldn't be seated there blah blah blah. I didn't see what the big deal was, the table was BOTH vacant and clean. That was kinda weird. Oh, well! I tried not to take that personally though. OK, now for the FOOOOOOD... We ordered the towering onion rings   - yummy and very crispy! It is the thing to get here b/c it was EVERYWHERE!! The table next to us had it, the table behind us had it, the table across from us had it, well... you get the idea! Description: 13 rings in all ~ Sweet yellow onions -- breaded & crisply fried. Served with tangy Campfire Sauce and ranch dressing for dippin'. By the way, the campfire sauce was like music to my taste buds! I got the spicy BURNIN' LOVE burger b/c a fellow Yelper recently posted a review about this particular burger, and it seem to have my name all over it - I thrive on anything HOT & SPICY. It did not disappoint. Here's the description: crisply fried jalapeño coins, tangy salsa and spicy Pepper-Jack cheese layered on top of our cayenne-seasoned burger, served on a jalapeño-cornmeal kaiser roll with chipotle mayo My spouse ordered a chicken sandwich. I thought that was not such a good choice b/c this place is mainly known for their gourmet beef burgers. When in doubt, order the thing that dominates the menu (beef burgers in this case).  My 9 year old boy got an item from the kids menu - a pretty plain cheeseburger. I'm still waiting for the day when he'll eat a burger with more than just the meat, cheese and bun! I ordered the new salted caramel shake (available for a limited time) and that was a yum within a yum Mmmm. The sweet & salty combination made for a nice caramel shake. I love the shakes here. Service was good overall. We had like 3 waitresses (including the hostess), so I could not really tell who the main server was. One of the girls (hostess) brought some complimentary apple slices for my son... funny how my boy was craving their apple slices when he won't even bother to eat the organic apples I have at home! Anyway, the hostess and all the others were very nice and attentive. Casual joint w/ a fun vibe, family-friendly, and good w/ kids (very important to me).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ventura?start=60,3.36,3.36,3.36,2.604,3.3600000000000003

Their bottomless steak fries come with every order so pour their seasoning all over it and enjoy. I had the Bacon Tavern Double for $7.99 and the burger was smaller than expected, but tasted very good. Amazingly, the calories for that burger were under 600 calories, but the fries for each order was 400+.

105,Lesley H.,"Elk Grove, CA",270,161,65.0,1.0,2012-09-14,"Red Robin Breakdown: THE FOOD: Red Robin is a chain and has pretty much standardized its food.  It's very heavy burgers with steak fries.  Mine were greasier than usual though at this location. THE VALUE:  About $8-10/burger, $3-7 drinks THE EXPERIENCE:  I moved to Ventura about two months ago.  I used to frequent the Red Robin in Santa Clara in NorCal.   **However,  at this location I had a terrible server.  Her name was SANDY.  She was rude and actually made fun of me.  We were seated at the booths near the bar.  I ordered a turkey burger and made sure there was no cheese on it (I can't eat cheese) and a rootbeer float.  When she came to take the order, I was reading the nutrition facts (this information will become relevant later). Sandy went to the bar to ask for my rootbeer float.  While there, she chatted with the bartender (another girl).  She mocked me and said ""I'll have a turkey burger, with no cheese, sauce on the side, and no bun....make it really healthy and then order a FATTENING rootbeer float.""  She was so loud and laughed, while having the audacity to call me ""stupid"" and ""picky."" I was really appalled by this behavior and lack of respect.  I understand the irony of ordering a healthier choice and adding a rootbeer float, but I feel that it is my five-ten extra minutes of cardio that I have the right to decide on.  It is certainly not appropriate to mock or openly complain about customers, especially with them present. For the record, I have enjoyed Red Robin in the past at other locations.  This was my first time at this location.  I enjoy the atmosphere and most of the food.  I might return to this location, but I'd be sure to request any server OTHER THAN SANDY.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ventura?start=100,3.32,3.32,3.32,2.404,3.3200000000000003

The food is consistent across the board, really. For my pre-birthday dinner I ordered a vegan burger, which came out a little dry. Nothing too bad, though. The server was really nice, so that made up for it a little bit. When I came back about three weeks later, I ordered the onion ring tower and a basket of zucchini sticks and mozzarella sticks. The zucchini sticks were sub par, I'd say, since they were really watery, and the batter kept falling off. Meh. The mozzarella sticks were standard, pretty good. And the onion rings, yum.  Honestly, the only reason I've gone to this location those two times is that nothing else is really open late in Ventura. -_- Lame.

And that's a recipe for some service nightmares. Thankfully they seemed pretty on top of things. Kudos for them keeping their cool and keeping the drinks fresh and the plates cleared. That's not to say there weren't a few issues--you're never going to have all the meals come out at the same time, so it's probably safe to say not everyone's meal was hot. Mine wasn't, but I'm not too picky. And at the end of the day, it's a Red Robin. The burgers are always a little soggy and formulaic. But it's reliable and dependable, and you do get those fries that keep on coming. There are undoubtedly more fancy options in the area and you would do well to explore the scene, but if it's just something reliable and easy you want, you could also do a lot worse than the Red Robin at the mall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ventura?start=60,3.48,3.48,3.48,2.732,3.4800000000000004

The bartending has slumped over the last year. Tasting watered down mixed drinks or missing two inches of beer is unsettling.  In addition to seeing your drink waiting to be brought to you as your thirst increases as the drink continues to get warm, the food temperature sometimes feels as if it might fall into the danager zone. The overall consistency is less than one would expect and often will leave someone with the question ""is it really worth dinning here"".

92,R C.,"Oxnard, CA",1,2,,1.0,2015-10-30,MUST READ!!! Today 10/30/15 about 3pm I went to Red robin in Ventura at the pacific view mall along with 5 other family members. Our sever name was Sandy n she was a terrible waiter!(btw I was going to leave her name out but this is unacceptable) We waited about 25 mins just for our drinks n when we finally did get to place our drink orders it wasn't even Sandy our waiter who took them down it was another lady! Sandy our waitress seemed to be helping everyone else but us it wasn't that busy either for us to be waiting so long just to place our DRINK orders! It was almost like she was avoiding our table! When she finally came to get our food order she had a bad attitude with us for no reason. We asked for napkins probably about 3 other times n each time she brought us about 4 napkins we were a group of 6 really?! Everytime we asked for something she made it seem as if we were bugging I'm sorry we are a big group we do need stuff. So once we got home 4 out of 6 of us got really sick from the food we were all throwing up. We called and complain to talk to a manger n we were told it takes 24hrs for Bactria to get to your system so it couldn't have been them who had made us sick! Basically saying they didn't care! We have all had red robin plenty of times n have never had this reaction before so we have reason to believe our waiter put something in our food! I WILL NEVER EVER EAT HERE AGAIN! N I will let everyone know my experience here! So thank you Sandy!  I gave you guys one star but only because I couldn't post it without marking one but I give you guys zero stars!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ventura?start=80,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5000000000000004,3.0000000000000004

Arrived shortly after 3pm and didn't get out until after 5:30pm not because we were visiting, because that's how long RR was this time. Service from our waitress sandy was incredibly horrible, she came to our table maybe 4 or 5 times throughout our meal, other team members had to assist our dinner party. Whenever sandy did come to our table she brought a very big attitude, and major unnecessary sarcasm. My family comes to this RR quite often but after this visit may just make the trip out to Thousand Oaks from now on, love RR's food but service here has been habitually terrible. To top off our bad experience at RR a few of us were almost immediately sick with vomiting etc. called to report to management and they could of cared less, putting blame else where, we were not asking for any handouts or compensation but the manager kept shining us on, they could of at least acted like they cared and noted the incident.

I was glad and ordered a little more than usual, because, why not, I had 20% off.  At the end of the meal, rat weasel, aka the manager approached my table and said how was everything. I replied good. He continued to say""  what is that slip of paper on your table is it okay if I look at it."" Of course I agreed, and then he continued to say you can only use this at lunch time. I responded that I asked the waitress prior to placing my order and she said that I had a 20% off. Rat weasel decided to just run off into the kitchen with plates  which is probably a better position for him as a busboy than a manager seeing as he has zero customer service skills. I have been a member since 2011 and I don't plan on coming back here anytime in the near future.

He then went on to say how amazing the food was and reminisced on all the memories he had when coming to a Red Robin throughout High School and as a child. With this said, I said...why the hell not, let's go there for dinner...which was perfect because we went right after the gym.  RR is located on the west side of the Pacific View Mall (next to CPK) with entrances from the parking lot and or the mall itself. The hostesses put your name and party count into their iPad and then the waiting begins; we waited about 15 minutes-which wasn't too bad because there was already a line when we arrived.  We were seated next to the FULL BAR which was nice because there were multiple TVs playing the football game, plus we were seated away from all the parties with smaller (rowdy) children. Our server, Amy ""Christine"" was fine. She always seemed busy but still had time/remembered to attend to us. They have these iPad looking things at each table. Using this mini iPads you can order appe's, dessert, and non-alcoholic drinks. At the end of your meal, you can also pay your bill using these iPads on the table. After ordering our food was out within 15-20 minutes or so. Feel free to check out /like my pics from tonight's dinner. The burgers are pretty big and juicy. Highly recommend getting your bigger with some pink (medium cooked) and ask for shredded lettuce. I had the Fiery Ghost Burger, which was not spicy at all. It was fresh and had deep fried jalapeños inside. My hubs order the BBQ burger. His was just as juicy and messy to eat, all very tasty good stuff. Best thing about our dinner was the bottomless, thick cut fries. Okay, so what you do is...when the fresh fries arrive... You grab the RR Red Seasoning and just shake it all over your fries and Boom.

We recently decided to try other menu options and tried the Chicken Caesar Wrap. It was terrible. The chicken had obviously been microwaved and tasted like rubber without any flavor at all.

With so many other restaurant options, it will be simple to choose an establishment that values it's customers. I ordered the Simply Grilled Chicken Salad, which is essentially a garden salad with a few quartered cucumbers and a sliced grilled chicken patty. I usually like this salad, but the size keeps shrinking. It went from being served in a bowl to being served on a plate. Hardly an entree salad and at its current size is not worth the entree price. I recommend the salads at The Habit. At several dollars cheaper they are a very good value.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ventura?start=40,3.08,3.12,3.12,2.152,3.1040000000000005

94,Amber K.,"Port Hueneme, CA",0,50,,2.0,2016-07-01,"First off, let me start by saying that our waitress was FABULOUS. The service was definitely not an issue, and she did everything in her power to make things as good as she could for us. But unfortunately, what's going on back in the kitchen is another story... One of the main issues we had, is that I ordered a burger, and substituted a vegan patty in place of the meat patty, and then obviously ordered it with no bacon. I knew what I wanted, the waitress knew what I wanted (she repeated our order to us as she was taking it), but for some reason, the kitchen staff didn't get it. Why on earth would they think that I would want a vegan patty on my burger WITH BACON?!?! The waitress was super apologetic, and took it back to have it remade right away, but unfortunately it took them so long to make a replacement, that by the time mine came out, my husbands food was getting cold and soggy. Aside from that, everything was completely drenched in grease. I always get the garlic fries at every Red Robin I go to, and yes, they are always a little on the greasy side, but these were just ridiculous! We also ordered the fried pickles, which were so super salty we were both chugging water all day, and they were actually dripping with grease! Both my husband and I felt super sick for hours after eating there, just because we're not accustomed to eating that much grease. Once again, nothing against the serving staff (which is why I gave two stars instead of just one), but the kitchen needs to get it together!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ventura?start=80,3.12,3.14,3.14,2.12,3.1320000000000006

31,Debbie G.,"Oxnard, CA",75,21,10.0,1.0,2016-07-23,"We are regulars at Red Robin, not just this location but whenever we travel outside of town. To start we were seated quickly by the hostess and told our server would be with us shortly.. Uh yeah almost 10 minutes later no one came by to even introduce themselves or get our drink order.. Finally our server came and to start she is not in the right line of work, she seemed lost and out of place. Well 5-7 minutes passed no drinks and no server, we had been sitting there for at least 15-20 minutes at this point from when we first arrived and we were all starving and had not even placed or been asked for our food order! I pushed the ""call server"" button on the table kiosk so we could order our food, it took her another 5 minutes to come and still no drinks. Finally another server came by to drop our drinks off at our table, we didn't even have water at this point. I'm not sure if our server was new or just not a good day for her as I could see other tables around us getting served and attended too before us with other servers. Anyway our food finally came and at that point not once did our server come back to check on us, nothing I again had to push the call server button to get a refill on the bottomless fries as well as I placed my own drink order via the kiosk (since she never came back) she passed quickly glanced over and didn't stop! At this point we (table of 6) were practically done with our food and had not received not even one refill the so called bottomless fries! We waited and waited and at this point I was timing it, it took her 14 minutes to finally come to our table after I pushed the call server button! We were all done with our food by the time she brought more fries.. Horrible service! I'm not one to complain as I know it's a hard job I get it, I have worked in customer service over 20 years but we looked and counted and timed and to be honest she had at most 3 tables, and she would disappear into the back, kitchen area for what? I don't know but looking around the other servers had no problem keeping up with their tables and customers we saw them constantly rushing and hustling back and forth when ours was no where to be found!

29,Hooper C.,"Antioch, CA",17,6,4.0,2.0,2016-09-06,"I haven't been here in 4 years, sad to say service is just as bad as I remember it.  Went in on Sunday, during a rush, which is understandable why service is a stretch. But it seems that this chain, which when it first opened was fun and roomy, became a money crunching machine. Four years ago, the atmosphere was hectic, you're lucky to get one refill of fries or a drink.  Going back to my experience on Sunday, wait time to be seated was around 10 minutes, no issue there.  We were sat at a two person booth, given our menus and told our hostess would be with us in a minute.  She came sniffling and rubbing her nose with the back of her arm, careful to not be too obvious that she was obviously sick.  She took our order, but it felt rushed, in the end we ordered a drink that they didn't have an ingredient for and while we were deciding she told us to order on the little screen on the table. Which by the way, are both a interesting and impersonal device. But we didn't finish our order, and when we told her what else we wanted she picked up the screen and told us if we wanted anything else to order on the screen.  I didn't think much of that at the moment, I was enjoying myself with my partner and we were conversing and playing a game, which goes back to how the little screen was interesting. At 1.99, if you want to have a few rounds with your friends it's a great idea. But it is an impersonal way to order drinks and food, which we wished there was an option to take it easy on the ice, we felt that this took away the appeal of a fun funky atmosphere into just a glorified fast food joint, where you don't really need a host to really take an order, and might as well go to the front to get your food.  We got our drinks, mine a freckled lemonade was filled to the top with ice. Which made it taste like lemon water, and my partners drink was also to the brim with ice, and with a small swirl of whip cream to make your own orange cream drink.  Bad drinks were not a big deal, on occasion drinks can be pretty off so we just requested low ice on the refills. We ordered the Poutine, but were given no cutlery besides two knives and napkins. It was pretty bothersome to have to request forks and wait even after we were served our appetizer and left without being asked if we needed anything. The Poutine was pretty good, we requested no gravy, the mushrooms were soft and well seasoned, fries are regular house fries, and the sauce had a nice low spice to it.  We got our meals, I ordered the waffle bun and my partner ordered the Mac and cheese burger.  We both shared half of our burgers since we were curious about the new meals.  The waffle burger was this sticky mushy sloppy mess of a thing. It tasted like orange chicken, and reeked of honey, it mushed together and fell apart easily. It was probably the most unenjoyable burger I have ever had. While the chicken was perfectly cooked, the smell was so distracting you couldn't enjoy the taste of the burger. The waffle bun was nonexistent, smashed, soggy, and really was a disappointing waste. The thing that I wished was changed was the red pepper syrup, it just wasn't appealing and really made the burger turn into a mess.  The Mac and cheese burger was lazy and underwhelming. The Mac and cheese had a bitter mellow taste, really nothing special there, it also spilled out and wasn't properly set. The meat was meat, normally I don't eat red meat, but I couldn't taste anything complex about it. It wasn't seasoned, unless the char on it is considered seasoning.  Other than that nothing about our meal was particularly good, we are members of red robin, and we ate at a few locations- and this was by far the worst location I have ever been to. But maybe it's the lack of hands that really throws this location off, they need more people. They need to be a bit more personal. I did tip the girl $5 which was more so than the suggested amount.  I didn't mind it since she didn't bring us our food while she was sick, I figure if your sick and working you must need the money. And I'm not employed right now, so I know how it is. She tried her hardest, and her service was more an issue with how the restaurant is ran rather than her personal work ethic.  If you want to try this place out avoid rush hour or dinner, unless you're absolutely craving it of course.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ventura?start=20,3.16,3.05,3.05,2.3760000000000003,3.094

2,Mikey C.,"San Buenaventura, CA",145,297,3874.0,4.0,2016-12-07,"Even though I have lived nearby for over ten years, this was my first time trying a Red Robin.  I love their commercials and every time I see one I tell my wife, ""Maybe we should try that place."" She always says, ""You know you're not going to like it.  It's not your kind of place.""  She has a valid point.  This is definitely not my kind of restaurant.  They probably have 40 or 50 different varieties of hamburgers on the menu and none of them appeal to me.  I don't need a lot of weird stuff on my burger and if there's going to be sauce added, I want to be the one applying it. Yeah, I know they have a straight up hamburger with none of the extraneous toppings.  OK, that might work.  But hold up, what is the fries situation here? Steak fries?  Oh hell no.  Not with a burger!  With a steak, maybe.  We'll talk.  But steak fries don't work for me in a burger situation. OK, maybe my wife is right (she always is). At first glance, it's not my kind of place. But then I discover that Red Robin has a customer loyalty program, and they give you a free burger on your birthday.   I thought to myself, ""Hey, I have a birthday!  I bet I could qualify for one of those free burgers!""   Suddenly Red Robin is becoming more and more like my kind of place.  I went to their website and signed up lickety split! Then, while I'm on their website, I check out their menu.  Pages and pages and pages of the most beautiful hamburgers imaginable.  Beautiful, I'll admit,  but to me, unappealing.  I was almost ready to give up.  But then I noticed they serve patty melts.  I love patty melts!  And what's this? They have French Onion soup, too?  Hey, I now I'm getting into this. So I drop by today to enjoy my free birthday patty melt.  I requested a booth and Dolores, the hostess, led me to the back of the restaurant where they have small two person booths.  I'm only five foot one, but I was a little cramped in that tiny booth.  I asked for a table change and Dolores cheerfully accommodated my request. My waitress, Monica, was at my table moments later.  I mentioned it was my first visit to Red Robin and she explained what I needed to know and answered all my questions.  After my meal was delivered she kept an eye on my table, ready to bring anything I needed. I started with a cup of French Onion soup, because I love the stuff!  As it does everywhere, it came with a cheese topped crouton and that had been passed under a broiler.  The crouton here was very good.  Toasted and buttered on each side, it's covered with just the right amount of bubbly melted cheese.  The crouton was the best part of the soup.  That's not optimal, of course.  But it is not surprising, either.  In restaurants that don't specialize in French Onion soup, its's quite common.  Not necessarily a deal breaker.. As for the soup itself, the broth was good.  But the onions in the soup were wayyy undercooked.  You would expect them to be so limp they almost melt into the broth.  These onions still had the same shape they did when they were cut. I couldn't tell if I had a bowl of C's or U's. Undercooked onions in French Onion soup?  That's a deal breaker. But, did I mention the broth was tasty?  Yes, because check this out: right when I finished off the delicious crouton, the hostess brings over an additional two slices of toasted bread.   OK, I was just about to give up on the soup.  But with back up bread I was able to take care of all that broth.  Still had to work around the undercooked onion pieces to get at the broth, but it was worth it. I have to say I liked the patty melt, despite the fact that it was totally over cooked. Monica asked if I wanted it a little pink, and of course I said Yes!  So, I was a little disappointed, but it was still hella tasty.  The grilled onions were undercooked (again? WTH?) and you can barely taste the rye in the marble rye the sandwich is served on.  Nevertheless, it was still a tasty sandwich.  Did I finish it off?  Pretty close! I ordered my steak fries well done.  That was stupid.  I should have just left them alone.  You live, you learn.  LOL. Washed it all down with a Strawberry Lemonade.  OK, first time trying one of these and I liked it.  I liked it a lot!  Polished off one, they brought me another.  God bless this country! Will I go back to Red Robin?  Definitely!  I'm scheduled for another birthday next year. I kid, I kid.  Of course I'm coming back.  I just found out they have bottomless root beer floats.   I almost wish I hadn't found out about that!   I accept your challenge, Red Robin!  (evil laugh) I'll tell you what: this is a fun place to eat, and I had great, really great service.  The employees clearly take pride in their jobs.   Mikey C says: thank you for the free birthday burger, Red Robin!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ventura,2.92,3.05,3.05,,2.9979999999999998

And worse off all the fries were all over cooked hard ends. All 7 of the fries on my plate. Ordered another batch and yet again, burnt, ends and again only about 7 in the basket. Now for a place that offers bottomless fries I don't get why they're being so stingy with them, or why they're all burnt ends. Maybe to cut costs?  Not sure, but I'm hoping this gets fixed ASAP!!!  I'd like to keep RR as my ""go to"" place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ventura?start=20,2.44,3.02,3.02,,2.7880000000000003
20,Sabrina N.,"Ventura, CA",4,4,,2.0,2017-04-15,"Food is great. Pick up service not so much. No fries. Paid for 'em, didn't get them. This seems to be a common theme with the listed complaints. I'll check better next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ventura?start=20,2.44,3.02,3.02,,2.7880000000000003
24,Mack N.,"Ventura, CA",0,36,,4.0,2017-04-25,"Great burgers, especially the Whiskey River bbq burger or chicken sandwich. Add Tavern Fries or a tower of onion rings.

33,L A.,"Ventura, CA",0,6,2.0,3.0,2017-06-23,"I ordered the whiskey bbq hamburger, lettus wrapped a little pink inside when I received it it was cold the waitress said let me bring you another one she did. It was cold and really pink onside.  I have ordered it this way before it was amazing. I do not know what's changed. I was looking forward to coming to Red Robin and getting an amazing hamburger like always and it's just not the same.  The service is amazing",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ventura?start=20,2.44,3.03,3.03,,2.7939999999999996
4,Crystal C.,"Oxnard, CA",3,58,64.0,4.0,2017-07-25,I visit this Red Robin very often. My favorite dish is the buzzard wings which are on a special menu for $5! I am a buffalo wing fanatic and can truly say these are some great wings ! Their burgers are always what the picture depicts which is usually rare. The only downfall I have seen with visiting this place is the amount of fries they give you with a bottomless fries order. I have on most occasions gotten less than half of a basket full of fries. I would appreciate more fries since they are bottomless. Otherwise the service is great.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ventura,2.48,3.02,3.02,,2.8040000000000003

12,Amelia C.,"Ventura, CA",24,4,,1.0,2017-08-17,"Jess was our server, to put it completely frank- she had a horrible attitude. I like red robin but they need to fire her if they want returning customers. She was curt, interrupted constantly, and hardly smiled. I'm in the restaurant business myself and attitude like that would get me fired ASAP",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ventura,2.6,2.98,2.98,,2.8280000000000003
10,Carol G.,"Oxnard, CA",0,17,20.0,4.0,2017-08-28,Stopped at red Robin today for dinner. We always enjoy the California burger and a small order of onion rings. Misha was our server and made our meal very special with her personality and conversation. We were very disappointed in the remodelling going on in the restaurant. It no longer has the happy go lucky fun pictures on the wall. The wine bottles hanging by a string  over the bar is extremely tacky. Removing the carrousel horse is losing the whole atmosphere of the restaurant. Don't know what someone was thinking to make any of these changes! Please bring us back the old Red Robin we love!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ventura,2.72,2.97,2.97,,2.87

1,Stephanie K.,"Ventura, CA",4,39,,2.0,2017-10-10,"The last time I went here, about a month ago, I was shocked. We went in and made our way to the hostess. 3 girls stood looking at us and then 2 walked away and the 3rd ignored us like we were invisible. Still standing there, patiently waiting. Waiting, waiting.....Suddenly the 3rd girl asks us if we had been helped!!!!!! What! You were standing right in front of us, ignoring us and pretend not to know we were not helped? This is totally unacceptable. My hubs looks straight at her and says ,"" you stood right there and ignored us as though we didn't exist, I will spend my hard earned money elsewhere! ""We quickly walked out and went to always dependable Yolanda's.  Really people? What has happened to customer service? We did complain to their headquarters. They said they would handle it. Of course they had to say they were sorry. A meaningless sorry. Our complaint fell on deaf ears. We never heard a peep from anyone at Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ventura,2.88,2.99,2.99,,2.9459999999999997

( near Levi Stadium).  We ate there twice in our 2 day stay.  I had fish and chips( 1st) meal my son had the burger  with bacon and egg on it. He said it was delicious. It was huuuge. Bottomless fries way cool   We also had the ""Tower of Onion ringsThat would have been a meal in itself.

0,Michelle F.,"Studio City, CA",28,139,161.0,5.0,2017-12-24,Immediately greeted. Small amount of guest already for Christmas Eve at 11 am.  Our waitress Jess (jessica) on the receipt provided phenomenal service. We have a 10 month old baby. She assisted and provided high chair. She asked what we like to drink. We ordered water and coffee and Jess offered us baby water. Thank you for thinking of the baby. Ordered our food and we ordered a side turkey patty for the baby which Jess brought that out a short time later before our food and it was appreciated. Jess was attentive to us & provided excellent customer service with a smile. Thank you Highly recommend this place & ask for Jess. Just noticed $1.99 entertainment fee. I am assuming that tablet on the table which we didn't use.  Not really sure what that is but I will call after Christmas.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-ventura,3.28,3.02,3.02,,3.1240000000000006
