It has walnuts, apples, Dijon flavored mustard, and mixed greens. He really loved it, and he's not too fond of salads. I ordered the margarita, which was only five bucks and it was perfectly made. The server, Mark, was attentive and really nice. He was waiting on quite a few tables and yet was able to check in with us frequently to make sure we had what we needed. If I was his boss I would definitely give him a raise. I highly recommend this location and will definitely be coming back.

43,Victoria O.,"New York, NY",684,721,322.0,4.0,2013-10-09,"First time at a Red Robin as the SB location se fue ages ago and my FB friends were right: it's a very good burger! I loved my cole slaw, so much so I am thinking we should hit RR and bring home a pint or something for me to eat on the way home.  I read the other reviews so was prepared for terrible service but our server was outstanding. Not good but great. When we walked in, it wasn't that crowded but the host told us we might want to sit in the bar because there were a ton of kids in the main dining area.  An excellent--and insightful--suggestion as I had a horrible hormone headache and I like other people's kids in public places but in moderate quantities. I have no desire for a Chuck E Cheese experience, at least if it is half as bad as my parent friends who pretty much associate with all that is evil about public places or children.  Our server doubles as bartender and still, he was efficient and friendly running his a** between the two jobs. He struck me as smarter than the average kid in college working at a casual eatery to make some extra money and I would not be surprised if he intends to get out of Visalia ASAP and go to a metropolitan area to do something interesting and fun with his life.  (We went to Foster's Freeze after dinner and while the sundae was perfect--just what I wanted--my stomach turned both at the smell and the sadness both of employees and customers. Those kids broke my heart, seeming destined for very little else by Foster's Freeze on Mooney Blvd. The sad vibe and smell made my boyfriend and me eat on the little stone edge outside before hopping back in the car to the Marriott.)  J ordered a bacon burger and the steak fries with the Thai dipping sauce. I thought the sauce was weird but he enjoyed it. My cheeseburger was great and as I was sick, I didn't drink alcohol so the tab for two including tip was only 26. Pretty great for the quality of the food.  (They do have a wide range of specialty cocktails in the 8 dollar range: big fruity tropical things. They also have ""beer shakes""--a combination of beer, whiskey and ice cream. Too weird for me but I thought I'd mention it)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-visalia?start=60,2.384,2.384,2.384,2.384,2.384

They're generous with the fried items and lemonade, etc. sometimes, that's what you want. No need to go highbrow or gastropub all the time. Still, wtf? Really not good. Chicken burger was cold in the center and not fully cooked. Broccoli was microwaved to destruction. Apple was past it's prime.

No refills or second order of fries.  Ordering milkshakes was probably the hardest  task ever at a restaurant. The staff messed up the order by bring wrong milkshakes. Then second time they brought one less than we ordered. The third time they brought the wrong type of milkshake so we finally gave up.  Lastly they messed up our bills.

We finally get seated my girlfriend orders a water as do I and thats when the claws come out, the waitress gives us a look and says ""thats all you want to drink?"" I simply ignore it assuming thats just how she is. So the reason we stopped by here is for a free birthday burger for I and the girlfriend ordered her own burger. I order the burger and the waitress comes back moments later saying I cant have that burger since its considered a ""fine"" burger. No where on the RR App does it mention of any restrictions. I speak to the manager who also has no power to do anything about it so I order a regular burger one ""approved"" for the free birthday burger meal. Same thing, now the computer wont allow it to be inputed. We finally get the burgers and I dont want to even eat it till I clarify if it will be free or not. The manager comes over says she was able to fix it somewhat I just simply thank her for her ""help"" and proceed to eating the burger which wasn't the best I ever had. The fries were cold at first but after we gave a few more complaints they came out piping hot. Overall I would say the service here definitely needs working on. The manager needs to retrain many of her employees who are immature and severely lack customer service skills.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-visalia?start=100,2.4,2.4,2.4,1.7320000000000002,2.4

So I ate those and started to eat my burger while waiting for them to bring the right fries. The burger was not at all warm and had very little flavor.

I've had it numerous times before at other Red Robin locations and it was fantastic. My mom's salad sucked. The chicken was dry, there were a measly TWO fried jalapeño coins, and there was about one teaspoon of dressing in one small spot of the plate. We never received an apology or an explanation for the terribly slow service. The place wasn't even busy. It was like 30% full.

You certainly go through a lot with shitty inconsiderate customers and I'm sorry you have to go through that. Working in customer service I feel for you brother! Will keep tipping big for you!  Now on to the review. The four is because the wife and I haven't given up on R.R. Yet. When you choose the right thing you have the most amazing meal! Who would've known you can get so much joy for your tummy when eating a burger lol. But when you don't choose the right thing your stuck being unfulfilled and your tummy hates you cause you're still hungry! I love that they do bottomless fries and beverages ""certain beverages mainly your main sodas plus now root beer floats"", yum! Oh also Lemonade. I had the Southern Charm burger last time we came here a few days ago. It was good but wasn't great. Spent 14 dollars on the burger and I could've gotten a better one for a few dollars less; bigger too. But overall it was good, would definitely would try something else instead of this one. You can get a better one of these at Carl's JR lol it's the same burger just bigger and on a different bun. Customer Service Advice- don't be an ass to your server. Unless they're rude or deserve it, don't do it! If you just placed your order then turn around and ask him five minutes later ""where's my burger at? Everyone else is getting theirs!?"" First off.. this was an old lady doing this so ""I get it"" but still it was not cool and very disrespectful to the server. She didn't know we were waiting for 10 minutes before they even showed up to get our food and the other couples that came before her as well. Victor held is own and stayed cool about it. The 2nd incident- the couple behind us barely sits down and right after dealing with The bitty our server asks them ""hi folks what can I get you started with today?"" The guys first response is ""we'd like to get some drinks first!"" In the most condescending asshole voice ever! Again without missing a beat Victor overcame and took their drink order.

3,Brian T.,"Tulare, CA",172,89,121.0,4.0,2017-11-08,Red Robin is always strong - particularly in value. The quality of he food is good- but the value is great. Unlimited fries is a always a nice touch. Ample TVs and a friendly family atmosphere. This one on Visalia is frequently packed- today I got right in which was nice. I had the A1 perper corn burger which was decent. No complaints.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-visalia,2.48,2.37,2.37,,2.414
13,Shorty '.,"Sacramento, CA",16,48,2.0,5.0,2017-11-13,"This has got to be the best ""big party"" restaurant service I have EVER had!!! In a large party, typically the servers have a hard time keeping up with the many demands or it's hard to get everything correct. Our server was so attentive, and with so many demands, kept up with our many requests the whole time and with a smile! I would definitely come back to this RR!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-visalia,2.64,2.41,2.41,,2.5020000000000002

My family and I love eating here, however this locations is just dirty, the booth we were sitting in was sticky and the walls were dirty. We definitely won't be comming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-visalia,2.48,2.4,2.4,,2.432
20,H A.,"Visalia, CA",0,21,2.0,3.0,2017-11-20,Red Robin has improved a bit. Good food. Nothing out of the ordinary. It's the place to go when you can't decide where to go and it has something for everyone.  I like the chicken Caesar salad.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-visalia?start=20,2.56,2.4,2.4,,2.464
12,Alyssa H.,"Dinuba, CA",34,73,128.0,4.0,2017-11-25,The food is always good when I go. Always a packed place so if your not big on ppl....I would suggest somewhere else but there's a variety of food to choose from. So that's a plus. The waiters/waitresses are pretty attentive.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-visalia,2.64,2.41,2.41,,2.5020000000000002
8,Devin B.,"Long Beach, CA",0,10,2.0,1.0,2017-12-18,This was by far the worse Red Robin ever. It's very confusing when you walk in. The menus are missing items. I even asked for another one and it also was missing stuff. The food was not typical of what I have had at other Red Robin's. The places has more seats then it can handle. The waitress didn't even listen to the order on the drinks. What more can I say not a good representation of other Red Robin's!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-visalia,2.56,2.39,2.39,,2.458
7,Stephanie B.,"Los Gatos, CA",167,2,,5.0,2017-12-27,"I have lived here in Visalia since birth and I have always had A great experience while dining at this location.  Tonight we had a party of 12 and a few complicated orders. Our waiter was enthusiastic, funny, and very polite. His name is Michael and he told us he has only been working here 2 Weeks. This guy needs a New Years Bonus if you ask me for putting up with the crowd we had in the party room.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-visalia,2.56,2.41,2.41,,2.47
2,Dara R.,"Exeter, CA",52,287,224.0,5.0,2018-01-01,"My pervious review of Red Robin being a mediocre chain restaurant is no longer the case. My husband is a big lover of their burgers so after a full morning of shopping, I let him have his way and we came in here for lunch. Let me just say that the remodel isn't the only improvements recently made here. Our server was on top of his game. Fast, friendly and efficent. We never waited for refills, or our check. I decided to try the ghost pepper tavern burger. My burger was out of this world delicious! Perfectly cooked, seasoned and very spicy as I'd hoped. The fries were so fresh! Piping hot and damn good. I don't remember the name of the burger that my husband ordered but he was also happy as a clam with his meal. Prices are great, seating is cozy and comfortable, and the service was stellar. Looking forward to coming back again sometime.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-visalia,2.72,2.43,2.43,,2.5460000000000003
5,Alondra S.,"Chino, CA",160,15,21.0,5.0,2018-01-04,"I came in tonight with a party of 9, we were greeted with a great attitude by our server Stevie. He got us drinks, and complementary fries right away. As appetizers we got the onion rings which were crispy and delicious. For meals most of us did the sir acha tavern double which was delicious as well. We devoured it so rapidly we became full so quick. Stevie did a great job on keeping an eye on refilling and offering more drinks. The bottomless French fries kept coming as well, my family and I definitely enjoyed our experience there. Overall food was really good and having Stevie as our server made our experience 10xx better. I would say it is better than our Chino Hills location. Next time when we come up for vacation, we will be requesting Stevie as our server my family enjoyed him serving us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-visalia,2.76,2.46,2.46,,2.58
1,Monica P.,"Visalia, CA",96,90,232.0,5.0,2018-01-05,"As far as burger joints in Visalia go, this is probably as popular as in n out. Never a dull time at this place! I usually opt for the classic fav, the clucks and fries, but I decided to live a little and got the Taco Tavern double. Man o man I was not let down! It tastes just like a GOOD taco truck taco in a burger. And of course the bottomless fries are a plus. I also got this new drink that is called Titos cream soda. It's Tito's vodka and your choice or orange or raspberry cream soda. Trinity, our waitress, makes the best ones! She was also great with asking if we needed more fries or another round of those delicious cream sodas! My hubby always gets the clucks and fries and he's rated them the best in town in his book. Plus if you sign up for their rewards program, every 10th burger or entree is free.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-visalia,2.76,2.5,2.5,,2.604
