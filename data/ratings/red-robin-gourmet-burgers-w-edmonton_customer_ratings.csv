31,Matthew L.,"Port Moody, Canada",130,581,32.0,3.0,2012-04-05,"Red Robin is a great compromise when you're dining with somebody else who isn't  the most adventurous when it comes to dining out. This location is close to my office and the West Edmonton Mall. I've been here twice - the food is on par with all of the other locations, but I've found that the service at this location has been friendly, if a little clumsy sometimes. But they still understand that you're under a time crunch when you're lunching and the food comes out pretty quickly. And oddly, I think I enjoy the chicken sandwiches here more than I enjoy the actual burgers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-w-edmonton?start=20,2.38,2.38,2.38,2.38,2.38
18,Jenn T.,"Edmonton, Canada",38,277,463.0,1.0,2012-05-05,"1st time at this location; My friend and I went to this location for dinner on a Friday night; it was fairly busy. Upon entering, the interior looks pretty awesome and bright. There were 5 teens (I'm assuming all around 14 or 15) all standing around the hostess stand fooling around, as we approached to be acknowledged for a table a few of them sighed, rolled their eyes and scattered in different directions while one of them actually took down our name and told us the wait time. After about 10 minutes of waiting, we were seated by someone else. The waiter came in a timely manner and over the night was consistent with refilling our drinks, checking up on us and bringing out our food.  We really appreciated the attentiveness he took with us on a fairly busy night. Surprisingly portion sizes were quite small, Overall; the waiter was amazing and the food was okay. 2nd time at this location; My co-workers and I went to this location for a congratulatory lunch. The hostess argued with us because we did not want to be sat in the lounge area. The person who seated us (around the age of 15 or 16) smelled strongly of marijuana and looked like he might have been under the influence. We all assume that the waitress was extremely new; like first day new but we have no clue as she never mentioned it and we hardly saw her. - She took out drink orders almost 10 - 15 minutes after being sat which came about 10 minutes later. - She never came back for us to order our appetizers; we had to flag down a passing waitress (who happened to be the supervisor) to actually place our order for appetizers.  Which came out about 45 minutes later. - She came by about 20 minutes later and asked if all we wanted were appetizers; which we didn't because we wanted to also order our actual meals. - We received our food after about a half hour by another person who apologized for it being a bit of a wait and were almost completely done before she came by again asking us how our ""first bites"" were and that may only be because we all voiced a consensus as to whether she was purposely ignoring us and she potentially overheard. - The waitress had passed by our table multiple times without even a glance or any heed to our voiced requests for refills, etc.  We had to continually get passing waiters and waitresses to get our orders. - We noticed that she stood around a lot of the time talking to other employees and it wasn't busy at all. - It took us about 10 minutes just to flag her down for the bill. Due to her poor service we did not tip her although we did tip the food server as we appreciated his service.  Upon leaving, the waitress was noticeably upset and voiced it loudly to her co-workers. Overall; the food was okay, the service was really poor, the wait times were ridiculous and to be honest we would never go to this location again, ever. *We did send in a complaint to their head office with no response yet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-w-edmonton,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116,2.116

32,Eryn S.,"Edmonton, Canada",10,28,,1.0,2013-12-12,"I want to start my review by saying i LOVE red robins! We usually have good service, and leave full and satisfied! Now... on to my review... So my sister and i drove to Edmonton to do some serious Christmas shopping a few weeks ago. The freezing rain started to fall so we figured hey! Red Robins, have a beer give the sanders some time to get on to the highway. At 2 pm we were seated.  We sat there for a good 15 minutes before we were acknowledged- but that's okay we were happy to be sitting down inside. I ordered my draft Canadian and my sister ordered her draft Coors.  Since we sat for a while we were ready to order, i asked for the Cluck and fries with gravy - my sister got one of the burgers.  We sat there for 25 minutes without seeing our waitress - OR getting our beers. i finally told her i was just going to go to the bar and grab our own drinks- i could see our drinks just sitting there. Our waitress had 6 tables in her section... not one of us had gotten our drinks yet. SO I went up to the bar and asked the girl if she would be able to deliver our drinks - I was very nice... i used to be a waitress i know how it can get! - i told her our waitress must be really busy and we were just thirsty.  So anyways bartender got a different girl to bring our drinks... when we were half done our beers our waitress finally comes back and slowly makes her way through her neglected section... she stops at our table and asks how our beers taste... i said fine and we would like two more when she gets a chance.  I'm going to wrap this up... because i could seriously write i novel.   We never got our other beers. We finally got our food... it was cold - i sent my gravy back asking if she would just heat it up- she never came back. 4 of her tables ( then us) were trying to wave her down for our bill's. Finally i seen the manager and asked her to help this waitress out... by that time we were there for 2 1/2 - 3 hours, ate shitty food and didn't even get to enjoy another beer ( i know... first world problems ). The waitress came back and said and i quote...  ""Umm, like my manager wanted me to give these to you, i don't know why but like there for you guys ""  She didn't know why? Love... your not blind.. just a bad waitress... She gave us Red Robin gift cards... she gave us FIVE 25$ gift cards.  i wanted to scream at her ""let me help you for the love of god!""   After we paid ( first time i EVER paid with NO tip! i had the guilty s for a bit)  she ran off... and i made sure to give a 25$ gift card to EACH of the tables that were still waiting for there bill... like she was supposed to do.  ...I'll be back to eat there... but ill just make sure that a long blonde haired girl names Jessica is NOT our waitress.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-w-edmonton?start=20,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18,2.18

However, they do offer tasty gluten-free buns (French Meadow - USA brand) or lettuce-wrapped burgers.  I haven't ever had an experience that made me ill here, but frequently the orders are not quite as requested.  Sauce on the side, no pickles... attention to detail seems sometimes missed.  I have had my chicken burger arrive at the table a little more cooked/over-charred on more than a few occasions at this location, and sometimes it can be cold.  I feel badly that I have had to send it back, but that's part of the business. If you are arriving, and a large group is here, you may want to sit in the lounge/bar area to get prompt service. Oh, and don't order the hot chocolate unless you like it watery.

16,Jeff G.,"Edmonton, Canada",41,214,117.0,2.0,2014-04-24,"I still love Red Robin's burgers but I've got to say that the quality of service at the 171 St location has become deplorable. My biggest heartache? The French Fry situation. Red Robin used to serve their ""bottomless"" fries in a basket and whenever you were starting to get low, your attentive server would approach and ask if you wanted more. This was back in the olden days when Red Robin still believed that keeping customers happy was a good business move. They now put your fries in an impossibly small silver cylinder that holds about ten fries (I'm not kidding). It takes about three minutes and change to consume them all. I understand that this is a corporate decision and that this location isn't too blame for that stupid move. However, when I ask for the fries to be replenished it shouldn't take 20-25 minutes to bring them to the table, which is what happened the last few times that I've eaten here. I didn't have to wait that long for the meal in the first place. This happened again last night. After I'm waiting for about 15 minutes, the server comes by and asks, ""Have you gotten your French Fries yet?"" Uh, isn't your job to bring them? Who the hell else is going to do it? After another 5-10 minutes she returns and drops the fries on the table (they're in a basket this time so they do still have those kicking around) and continues about her business. She didn't apologize for the unreasonable wait nor did she even acknowledge that it took such a long time for them to materialize. By that time I had already finished my meal.  French Fries are a fast-moving item at Red Robin and there's no excuse for making customers wait that long. They're obviously cheaping out by giving smaller portions at the start and apparently refills are the restaurant's lowest priority. If this had been a one time only isolated incident, that would be one thing, but this paying no mind to customers and taking them for granted is the norm at this Red Robin now. When you read the most recent reviews of this location you'll see the common thread - this place treats customers like panhandlers asking for spare change. If I enjoyed that sort of treatment I'd  become a Jehova's Witness and start going door-to-door. I really like Red Robin's food, but not enough to endure being treated as persona non grata. I'm done going to this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-w-edmonton,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003,2.3760000000000003

There didn't seem to be anyone working there who was over the age of 18 (not dissing young adults, but they didn't really seem to know how to cope).  We were seated by a bus boy.  The table was sticky and the booth seat had crumbs on it.  Generally, the place looked dirty.  My burger was fine, but my husband was very disappointed with his meal.  The fries are now served in some strange metal rim and the look very sparing on the plate.   I hope the manager takes control of this location, as Red Robin used to be one of my favorite burger places.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-w-edmonton?start=20,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44,2.44

The food's okay, don't get me wrong. They serve a tasty burger. But the place is always crawling with kids. And after this experience, I won't be back. My husband and I happened to be in the West End on an errand, and were hungry when we were done. I was throwing options out, and hubs wanted a burger, so Red Robin it was.  When we got there at around 4:30 PM midweek, the hostess told us there was a booth in the bar. Before I could say no, that I'd like a table in the restaurant, my husband took her up on that. I was annoyed. And it turned out with good reason. The previous poster who mentioned the unsupervised staff was right on. They put us at the booth RIGHT NEXT to the bar. These servers were gabbing at full volume so loud I could barely hear myself think. Completely unprofessional.  So whether they liked it or not, we told them we were moving, and headed down the stairs and into the restaurant. And then were even more annoyed because there were plenty of tables. The hostess had just been really lazy and hadn't wanted to walk a little further to take us to a table.  Then the fun really began.  A child's birthday party arrived, first gathering in the lobby area right behind us, then moving to a table, also right behind us. Turned out moving had only made things worse. That was the last straw for me. The parents didn't control their kids, who were yelling full volume, so the rest of my meal was extremely unpleasant.

24,Aleksander E.,"Edmonton, Canada",119,30,,4.0,2015-06-24,"Sadly, like many other posters, this is not my favourite location. The downtown location is by far the one I prefer. Time of day also makes a difference. Don't bother between 12-1:30pm. It's packed and bustling. Same with 5-7pm. Brunch and Lupper are your best times to get great service and hot/edible meals.  There was a Chris (male) server at this location that was down to one shift per week as he was back at post-secondary full-time. Amazing service, on the ball, I always had a full cherry lime flip at my table (and boy can I drink 8-10 of those in one visit to Red Robin's. No diabetes yet!) The parking lot is not being overblown by other users. However, it is quite large and merges with Superstore's parking lot, so there is never a shortage of space. Unless you're driving a tank or the typical Albertan truck, it's not difficult to park, it's getting out during high traffic times that will be your issue.  Other posters are not exaggerating about the socializing of servers impacting customer service quality. Due to the location, clientel will never be an issue for this location, as it's near the densely populated west end. However, Red Robin's seems to be the Chuck E Cheese of Edmonton (and perhaps Canada). Screaming kids galore, especially weekend afternoons, Friday and Saturday night. If you enjoy your hearing to remain intact, avoid these times. That being said, this is not Red Robin's fault, merely head office marketing strategy to aim at the youth demographic and presenting themselves as a family friendly restaurant. The bathrooms are also hit and miss for cleanliness. Busy times: disaster. Empty soap dispensers, no more paper towel, low to no toilet paper. Otherwise, clean, stocked, but a bit musty and outdated. As for the food, I have never had a bad burger at this location. I must have tried at least 20 different burgers across my torrid love affair with Red Robin's and he keeps seducing me back without fail. I have not had an issue with bottomless fries here, but I do tend to attend on Monday-Thursday night when it isn't busy. Prices are extremely affordable and only slightly more than what one would pay for a fast food combo these days. I look forward to returning on the slow days.

17,Jamie F.,"Edmonton, Canada",11,35,5.0,4.0,2015-06-26,"As a young'n back in the day, I used to go to the downtown Red Robin's all the time after a movie at Eaton Centre (dating myself here). I haven't been any Red Robins in a long time (probably five years I'd guess), but I have to say our visit to the west end location a couple weeks ago was great.  The first thing that struck me was that it hasn't changed one bit and I loved that. It was like a wonderful trip down memory lane. The best part was the arcade that they have located beside the lobby. Inside, there were lots of old games I remember playing as I grew up - and they are still just a quarter each!  We got there just before the supper rush, say about 4:30 or so, and even though our waitress was busy with several other tables, she was friendly, quick and professional.  The kids had fun and their menu offered a lot of different options. My kids aren't too picky, but for those that are, the menu is great because it offers a variety of entrees and sides that you can pick and choose from. It also offers two different portion sizes on some items to accommodate kid's differing appetites. After scanning the menu and seeing that they didn't have the Chimichanga any more (although they may not have had it the last time I went either, I can't remember), I ordered the Whisky River Chicken burger, which was just as delicious as it was in the past. My wife ordered the Five Alarm burger (I think that's what it is called) and thought it was great too. As always, Red Robins offers not only bottomless drinks but fries too, so we had a couple orders of their awesome thick cut steak fries.  What really surprised me was the dessert menu though - that has gotten an upgrade. They still have the old stand-bys like cheesecake and Mudd Pie, but have a couple newer up-to-date items you might see in trendier places. We got the Fruffles, which are fudge brownies dipped in dark chocolate and sprinkled with sea salt and sugar crystals, served with strawberry sauce and whipped cream for dipping.  Even though they are sweeter than I like, they were one of the best restaurant desserts I've ever had (Chocolate Lava cake is probably at the top of that list). The only thing that would make them better would be raspberry sauce instead of strawberry (to cut the sweetness level a tad).  I've got to say that it was a really great time and the fact that they haven't gutted the inside and painted the walls black or dark brown is refreshing IMHO. Everyone is constantly renovating and updating their decor but the fact is people come for the food, not the artwork on the wall. If you ask me, the only thing that should ever change is the menu and even then fan favourites should stay as long as they remain popular.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-w-edmonton,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64

My salad with chicken, apples and candied pecans has always been served in a deep bowl, and was always satisfying enough to be a full meal. Today it arrived served on a plate and appeared to be hardly more than 1/2 of its usual portion, although the price seemed unchanged. The waitress explained that the salad now included ""3 kinds of lettuce, so since it's more expensive to make (probably costs them about 75 cents more now), they had to cut on the amount they served to save money.

The burger was well prepared, and the toppings were plentiful and deliciously messy...and the fries...endless and YUM with a sprinkle of their in house seasoning salt!! We were able to dine on 2 giant burgers and endless fries for less than $30 which is pretty average I suppose. The washroom has touch free faucets and paper towel dispensers, and has a trash can placed near the exit to discard the towel when opening the door...all of these touches very much appreciated for a slight germ-a-phobe like me hehe but the washroom did smell like urine which was not fun...but it is a washroom after all.

The last time I was at a Red Robins was for a birthday last year so it seems I average one visit annually.  So anyone who has lived in Canada has probably been to Red Robins. Their pricing is very good for a decent burger and endless fries. I can usually only eat one to two servings of the fries so it being endless isn't really a selling point for me. I guess others can put back 3-4 servings so it's more valuable for them. Be aware that there will be a lot of children and probably on their birthday's which means you'll hear the song many many times throughout the night.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-w-edmonton,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6
8,Jason B.,"Edmonton, Canada",25,23,6.0,1.0,2016-06-22,"Disappointing. Haven't been here in a while, but had a hankering for a burger so stopped in.  For the record, the burgers are really good. Great taste.  That's said, I had the guacamole bacon burger. And by guacamole, I actually thought it would have some on it! I think i saw something resembling green, but would have been less than the remnants on a spreader whipped off on the bun.  Really too bad.  Fries here used to be fantastic. My 2 batches tasted like they were freezer burned or something similar.  Finding staff here is a challenge too. Oh well, is what it is. Will probably be another long time before I come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-w-edmonton,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
23,Nikki M.,"Edmonton, Canada",0,14,,2.0,2016-08-26,"Red robin is a solid burger joint, this location has gotten worse in the last few years. My husband, daughter and I waited an unusually long time for our food, which isn't all that unusual to be honest. I ordered the whiskey river BBQ chicken wrap with fries and everything came out ice cold, like it had just come out of the fridge. I spoke to the waitress who was very apologetic about the situation and brought the manager over, who wasn't very concerned. She told us she was standing and watching and all the food was coming out in a reasonable amount of time so there was no reason for it to be cold, and also the wrap is made with an ""ice cold sauce."" I understand, wraps are occasionally served cold but that was a little absurd. She kind of made us feel like this was all our fault. They offered to remake our meal but at this point we had already been there well over an hour so we asked for something to be done about the bill. They took both mine and my husbands meal off the bill, so that was a nice surprise. The waitress was super nice about the whole thing, the manager could be less snarky towards customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-w-edmonton?start=20,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56
6,Ashley B.,"Halifax, Canada",37,106,31.0,5.0,2016-10-24,"For some odd reason i've never heard of this restaurant. I'm a burger fan too so I'm a little disappointing in myself really.. We dropped in here after a long day of shopping. First off, give yourself a good half hour to even decided on what to eat, the menu is small but SO much items to choose from! May i add, this is the ONLY restaurant ive seen that offers lettuce wraps for their burgers. (Instead of a bun they use lettuce) I was so happy! As i rather have lettuce so i don't get to full from the bun. I believe i ordered one of the BBQ burgers (sorry i can't remember!!) and it was everything i excepted, delicious, juicy and very smokey!  Also tried one of the maui cocktails, very good, was a double too so i wasn't complaining! Really looking forward to coming back to this place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-w-edmonton,2.64,2.64,2.64,,2.64
15,Chrystal M.,"Calgary, Canada",0,7,,2.0,2016-12-02,We are from Calgary and were excited to see a Red Robin's as the last location in Calgary left years ago. The hostess was beyond rude dropping our menus on the table and walking away. Front end staff seemed more interested in flirting with the guys in the arcade than serving customers. Food was left sitting on tables for the whole time we were there even though the restaurant is dead. There are 3 tables with dirty dishes and half eaten food left on them which is less than appetizing when you are trying to eat. Our server was very good and attentive but overall staff are spending their time chasing each other around the restaurant giggling acting like they are in high school which they probably are. I'm sure there are much better places in the area.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-w-edmonton,2.6,2.6,2.6,,2.6
20,Jazlynn R.,"Stony Plain, Canada",0,1,,5.0,2016-12-16,"Me & my boyfriend probably eat here at least once a month & it's our favourite restaurant! Definitely recommend the bruschetta chicken burger! The bottomless fries are great & I usually always get a cherry lime flip drink with my meal which is bottomless as well! 9/10 we have wonderful service, & are always welcomed with a smile. However I have never been with a large group & plan on going for my birthday this month so I hope it goes well so I can continue to rave about this place.

11,Barry M.,"Bridgeville, PA",0,5,,2.0,2017-01-14,Nothing special. Burgers tasted ok but had sat under the warmer and fries were on the cold side. Service below average. Messed up 2 orders and it was not that busy.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-w-edmonton,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72
4,Phil J.,"Edmonton, Canada",10,108,,3.0,2017-02-20,"Red Robin is a busy place At suppertime's its fastest pace. Though burgers are their tour de force . I preferred  a low carb course. To get it, first we needed seating;  It took time for the hostess's  greeting. Then there was an interlude, 'Fore  an approach by the serving dude.  Orders there  are made in stages, Drinks, then food; that would take ages. Drink with food,  we gave our order Hoping for  a wait that's  shorter. Alas, another intermission, I think the problem's in the kitchen. My  avocado chicken dish Was wrapped in lettuce, per my wish.  Yes,  the service wasn't hasty,   But the  wrap itself was  tasty,  Although the iceberg - lettuce wrapping Made a messy meal trapping.  As for leave - offs, dude got it right, And so my meal was also  light. The food was good, but just the same, We were malnourished when it came.  The server did apologize (They often do  in this franchise. ) Eighteen dollars was the cost, Without  the value of  time we  lost.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-w-edmonton,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72

The burgers were hot and delicious, and bottomless fries were awesome.  The only critique I would give is that while the staff are very nice they were not always the most attentive, as we ended up waiting half an hour to pay and the restaurant itself wasn't exactly busy.

7,Kevin C.,"Winnipeg, Canada",33,55,,5.0,2017-10-06,"I live in Winnipeg and anytime I make a trip to BC or Edmonton, I always try to get to Red Robin as soon as I can. On my first night in town, I pulled into the parking lot about 15 minutes to close. I sat in the car for a second and thought ""Do I really want to be the guy who comes in right before close"" and I decided I was already there, so I'd feel it out. When I came in, I think there might have been one other table in the place. I immediately asked the girl at the bar if it was too late for me to get an order in. She replied in a happy tone ""We've always got time for you!"" so I pulled up a stool. Alyssa stopped what she was doing once I sat down and took the time to chat with me for a bit. I instantly forgot about the fact that I was coming in just before close and was happy I could get my visit to Red Robin in early this trip. She told me about the new menu, told me what the drink special was and recommended me a burger (Chophouse I think it was called). While I waited for my food (which didn't take long at all), instead of going back to what she was doing to get ready for her close, she still entertained me even though I was her only guest. She told me in the midst of our conversation that she has a position as a shift leader and how much she enjoys working for the company. Usually when a company takes good care of their staff, that gets passed along to the guests, and it shows in this case. The food - as always - was great too. I know we are in a time where it can be hard to find good staff, but that night I was definitely served by someone who understands what this business is about. I will definitely be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-w-edmonton,3.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0000000000000004

1,Randy S.,"Edmonton, Canada",56,149,45.0,2.0,2018-01-04,"So maybe it was a mistake to arrive right @ 6p on a Thursday between Christmas and New Years.  The huge number of people waiting should have been a clue.  But stupidly we followed along and we were told it would only be about 5-10 min wait.  To the credit of the young gal working the host position she was pretty accurate.   We have been here before and usually you can just seat yourself in the bar area.  Today, no.  Today we were seated in the bar area, like it was part of the restaurant area.  A gal came up to us, said that she wasn't our server and that our server would be over shortly to take our order.  However, she would take a drink order.  Ok great.  About 2 mins later the same gal came back and asked if she could take our food order (wait, didn't you just say someone else would be by ???  I'm confused).  We knew what we wanted so we gave her our order.  I had indicated that this part of the restaurant was exceptionally cold.  I was abruptly told that if I wanted to we could request another table, but we'd have to go back out to the host area and put our names in again.  That's ok, I have my coat, I'll just wear my winter parka in your restaurant (cuz that doesn't look bad).   Side note:  A guy at the other table physically went over to the thermostat, and when he came back he said to us that the thermostat had not been switched off from AC mode.  Note, being -25c outside, me thinks you don't need AC on.  He told one of the staff, and they switched it to heat mode.  Eventually the area began to warm up.  Back to the review...  We waited for what appeared to be a very long time for our food (in excess of 45 mins).  Granted they were busy, but really it shouldn't take that long to pump out a burger and fries.  Once we got our food, I noticed that there was a skim across the gravy.  My fries were not warm, in fact bordering on cold.  My wife's fries were at least warm (not hot).  The burgers, well, they were good, but again not piping hot like you think they should be.  Clearly our food sat under the heat lamps for a while.  I would have told the server that, but wasn't given the opportunity to.  Not once was she back to refill drinks, to ask how the food was, or even provide the bill.   Yes, once we were done, I along with the other tables in our area, were forced to go to the bar and request the bill.   I indicated that the food was cold, and was told that the manager was right at the kitchen and there is no way it could have waited to be served... well, the temperature of the fries and the skim on the gravy don't lie.   The gal was nice enough to completely comp us the meal.  Which I appreciate, but would have appreciated better service and a hot meal instead.   Overall, the only saving grace on this, a comp'd meal and an apology from our server.  Sadly, not enough to make me think I should go back.  Sorry Purple Chicken (aka: Red Robin), a customer has been lost.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-w-edmonton,3.04,3.04,3.04,,3.0400000000000005
