The menu offers moderate variety.  My daughter loves this place for the Mac and cheese.  I've enjoyed the fish and chips and nachos on previous visits. My wife seems to like the chicken sandwich. The fries are pretty good. Sadly, the burgers are a disappointment. The meat lacks true beef flavor. I had the bacon guac burger and I was unable to differentiate any of the favors of any ingredients in the burger. The meat was by itself, dry.  The bacon by itself lacked any smokiness or salt.  The bread is fairly dry and waxy.  Dry bread is generally welcome when mixed with a juicy burger. This is a corporate restaurant and as such, the food is ""sterile"" and leaves your stomach and body full but not enriched as a good meal should.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-waldorf?start=60,3.1160000000000005,3.1160000000000005,3.1160000000000005,3.1160000000000005,3.116000000000001

68,Cindy T.,"Waldorf, MD",1,20,1.0,2.0,2014-04-06,"I had lunch here on Saturday, April 5th. I had a taste for a Red Robin burger, since my last experience hit the spot. Yum! Well, I did something I don't normally do, which is stray from what I know works best for me. I tried a new menu option. The DGB. It had my favorites...arugula, roasted tomatoes with Angus meat. I requested my usual well done option. I also ordered the freckled lemonade too. Don't bother unless you don't mind sweetening it yourself. Well my yummy burger came back and I was already to dive in after putting some fixings on it. I cut it in half and I have a medium cooked burger. Now, I knew something was up when it arrived because it was more burnt on the outside which indicates it was cooked too fast. That's BBQ/GRILLING 101. I had it sent back and about 15 min. later it arrived. Better than the first, but I just ate around the pink and took the other 1/2 home to doctor it up. So, this was not my best experience with the food. The service was great until the end. When the young lady returned my card, she was waiting on another table and just turned around and placed it on my table. No have a good day, nothing. Needless to say she did not get my usual 20% tip. I chuck this up to the luck of the draw for the day. Just wasn't my day.

I got the burger well done and it was so juicy.  After you bit into the burger it literally melts away in your mouth like butter baby.  Ooooh Oooooh Oooooh ... just reminiscing on this burger makes me want to do the happy dance.  The burger also came with a fried egg, bacon, lettuce, a tomato on a burger bun.  They all stood in the shadows when it came to the taste of the burger.  Don't get me wrong, they were all delicious compliments, however the main attraction (the burger) stole the show.

Employees are always friendly and they have great servers. I don't ask for Kiera, but I am always happy when they seat us in her section! (I only remember her name because we were going to name our daughter that- no such luck, 3 boys. I'm done!) And, she is great with the kids.  Unlimited fries? What! Drinks are good. I have a Red Robin loyalty card so every now and then I'm surprised that the bill is low because a burger was free.  This place must have a really good manager because they have been going strong for years. Most places go downhill in this area after awhile. It seems simple...hire good workers, they will make good, consistent food and give good service = success!

They have excellent burgers and sandwiches, the fries are great, and they have other meals, soup and veggies. I like the onion rings and the fish and chips. It has a separate sports bar area as well as open family seating. It's one of those places where they celebrate birthdays and are upbeat. Has interesting decor and stuff to grab the attention of both adults and children.

I didn't sample any of the sandwiches, but everyone voiced satisfaction for their choice. My salmon entree was cooked perfectly!

7,Nicholas A.,"White Plains, MD",100,200,94.0,5.0,2016-08-31,"It may be a bit hard to categorize Red Robin. Is it a ""better burger"" chain like BGR or Five Guys? Or is it best thought of as a casual sit down place like Friday's or Ruby Tuesday? Either way, this location in particular is proabably the best Red Robin I've ever been too.  The service is friendly and competent if not always as speedy as it could be. So far, all the burger I've ate are all great. They seem to create new sandwiches from time to time, which is an A+ in my book.  The unlimited refills on many sides are great of you are hungry. The donut tower and onion ring towers are great appetizers before any meals.  All-in-all a GREAT place to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-waldorf,3.92,3.92,3.92,,3.92
