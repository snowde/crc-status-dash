By the time the bartender returned with a napkin and a knife, my food was cold. I don't need to be waited on hand and foot, but basic set-up is somewhat necessary. Afterwards she put the check in front of me (I guess I didn't want dessert after all) and didn't return to get me change for at least 10 mins. Beware the bar.

The services was absolutely horrendous.  It took 10 minutes to get drinks and luckily we ordered right when our drinks were served because it took another half hour for our food to be delivered.  Then when we had no silverware our waitress said she would get some, but did not.  We had to go find another waitress in the restaurant to ask for napkins and silverware.

The one star rating goes to a server who wasn't even ours, and literally said to my husband ""Wow, if I were you I wouldn't come back here either.""  That's how bad the service was here tonight. My husband and I came in about 7:15 on a Sunday evening.  We had two small children with us and the host neglected to ask if we needed a high chair or booster seat.  No biggie-we asked for a booster and he got one right out. We waited 5-10 minutes before our server came over, but she seemed nice enough and we put our order in-one kid's chicken finger meal, one ""BLTA"" sandwich (a cold turkey sandwich), and a plain bacon cheeseburger.  The hubs said twice that he didn't want mayo or tomatoes on his burger.   Twenty-five minutes later, our food still hadn't arrived.  I started turning to look toward the kitchen to see if our food was up, where I spied the server on her phone at a computer kiosk.  The manager walked by plates under warming lights several times, but must have been on another mission, since he never touched them. We finally asked a nearby server to get our waitress, as we'd been waiting a long time and needed to get our food to go.  His response?  ""Wow, you've been here a while-I don't know why your food isn't up yet!  I""ll go get her right now.""   The manager came over with the food wrapped up...but no sides with the child's meal, and one container of fries for the 2 adult meals.  His apology was lackluster at best, and he seemed annoyed when I commented that we wanted the fruit that was supposed to come with my son's chicken fingers.  Once we arrived home, we sat down to eat, and my husband discovered that his burger (the ""plain"" bacon cheeseburger) was covered in lettuce, tomato, and mayo.  Huge fail, Red Robin.  We won't be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wareham,1.956,1.956,1.956,1.956,1.956

There was a big glob of soggy disgusting onion straws on the bottom half of the bun that I had to scrape off. The bottom bun was also soggy from the BBQ sauce.

1,Amy G.,"Acushnet, MA",7,37,22.0,3.0,2015-10-21,"We'd been hanging on to a gift card for this establishment for some time now and decided to use it tonight. My expectations were set a bit low due to the dismal reviews I read - and due to previously eating here in the past and being underwhelmed. Upon entering the restaurant we noticed it had quite the face lift - with trendy decorations and a very modern art atmosphere. My family was promptly seated at one of the comfortable booths along the perimeter of the main dinning area. The tables each had what appeared to be tablet / kiosk device. Our waiter came promptly to our booth and upon noticing that we were taking interest in the device - explained its use. Beyond playing trivia and games ( group trivia was interesting) you could order your appetizer, desserts, refills for soda or fries and pay your bill! You can even flag your waiter if you needed them through the device. We thought that this was a really cool and useful idea.  We used it to buy the onion ring stacker appetizers and it was super easy and we got our order in less than 10 min. We played trivia on it while waiting for our meal and it was a great way to pass time - but our meal arrived very promptly - no more than 15 min after we had finished our appetizer!!! Delightful surprise. Unfortunately the check out option on the tablet would not work. When we were ready to go We attempted to use our gift card and it would not accept it. The waiter was more than happy to ring up our check at his station and even commented he had no idea why it wasn't working. You would think that with these devices on the table, service would be lacking - not true at all. Our waiter promptly brought over refills on our drinks and was close by monitoring our table throughout the meal which was very much appreciated. Service was fantastic!!!! Our food was mediocre at best - for a hamburger joint that toots its own horn about their burgers - we didn't find them that special. Maybe we ordered the wrong items - since most of the signature burgers had all sorts of unique toppings. We ordered a plain bacon and cheese burger and a mushroom and cheese burger. They were cooked appropriately however the mushroom burger was extra greasy. I'm starting to wonder if they hope the extra toppings makes up for the lackluster taste of the hamburger ?? Aaaaand yes - I agree with the other reviews - this place is a bit pricey - burgers that cost this much better come close to knocking off my socks - and I regret to say - my socks were securely on when I left.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wareham?start=20,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16

This particular location did not offer that kind of experience.  Our server was attentive in terms of coming over every single minute and asking if we needed anything. LITERALLY EVERY MINUTE. It was beyond annoying and disruptive of our conversations and peace. Although it seemed she was quite interested in being present, she mixed up our order big time, forgetting to ring in the substitutions and bringing only half the meal and not realizing. The kitchen's order ticket was still placed on my meal, so I was served a nice burger and a piece of greasy paper with my order printed on it (which is how I know she didn't ring it in correctly). Even so, she blamed it on the kitchen.  The mozzarella sticks were not melted whatsoever and still had the consistency of a refrigerated cheese stick.

We decided that since there isn't much in the area for quality atmosphere and food we would make a point to come once a month. We went in tonight and as the atmosphere hasn't changed much, actually getting a little better with the festive Christina's theme, the drinks went way down hill.  It's obvious the bartenders are not actually trained bar tenders but simply very nice people they recruited to sling booze.

When I ask for a less ""RR"" version and just a regular Long Island, I was then given after a 10 minute wait, a glass of ice and flat soda. She didn't know how to make a LI and had to google it. I drank that with my burger, that was OK, nothing special and then ordered and a Mai Tai as my dinner mate also ordered one earlier and it tastes rather good. I got what clearly was a different version of the common drink and tasted what was pretty much ice and grenadine. After that I gave up on getting a good tasting cocktail and finished the night off with a beer. I will be going back again as the first experience was great and I have no plan on judging the whole place based off of my last experience. Give it a try, not a bad spot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wareham?start=20,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16
20,Paul X.,"Boston, MA",47,45,1.0,4.0,2016-01-09,"I have to say, I was really quite surprised to see the bad reviews to this place.  We just came back from here and the hubby and I really enjoyed it.  Why? Love the fun decor and atmosphere.  There are a lot of nice choices for burgers and toppings/condiments A good, and rotating beer menu, better than some of the finer establishments I've walked into before. Bottomless fries.  Nice gimmick to bring in the Murica crowd.  :) An attentive and friendly server  A cute table ziosk with games to keep the kids entertained if you need a break from them after all that shopping (as this place is in the center of all the mall stores) And you can do a survey after on the ziosk.  Always enjoy doing those surveys.  You can also pay your bill through it.  Cool.   We'd both like a bit more pink in the burger.  (They don't do rare/medium rare/medium, etc., but instead ""pink or no pink""). Is it the best burger we've ever had?  Nope.  But it's certainly not the worst burger by any means.   It's the choices would bring me back here again easily.  Vegetarians clearly don't belong here.  Fans of cholesterol and calories do.  Don't eat here often if you value your health, but more for a once in a while indulgence. This place left a much better impression than the Longhorn Steakhouse which is across from here in the same mall area, which we tried and didn't care for the quality.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wareham,2.2,2.2,2.2,,2.2
32,Notso H.,"Brockton, MA",2,169,,3.0,2016-01-11,"I did go here around Christmas and it was busy and ok. Just visited again this past weekend and again OK. Met some friends and the best thing is for this area they have a decent beer selection. Better than average for the area and prices about average. I've only ever had a burger here and they do seem a little pricey for what you get but quality is on average for frozen burgers. One thing I didn't like was we were shown how to use the things on the table and ordered some of our food that way, then it just suddenly appears from the kitchen! But the waitress still is supposed to be tipped and she had no part in this transaction? Also the table next to us there was a child about 7 or 8 maybe that wanted to play with the electronic thing and his parent wouldn't let him so he threw a fit for about 2 minutes. I'm there to eat not play games, and I pay the server to take my order and serve me, so they may seem trendy but ditch the electronic crap. Also it must be one of the things that adds to the overhead driving the cost of the food up. Ditch the electronic devices!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wareham,2.24,2.24,2.24,,2.24

I found a new favorite there this weekend, the Chicken tortilla soup. I would never say a chain is going to have gourmet burgers, but they are pretty good. We don't have kids so we always ask to sit in the bar side as it is 21+. Some places still let kids in the bar area.  Wish these places would stop putting in the screens on the table. I don't work at a restaurant so I don't want to have to order my food on a machine at my table. Just like I don't work at the grocery store and I do not want to cash myself out.

When it arrived, there was a piece of French fry floating in it. Took it out and didn't say anything. Then I ordered the BBQ wrap. Food took forever to arrive. Manager apologized twice. When the food finally got there, it was a burger, not a wrap. Sent it back and the manager got the wrap for me. It still didn't taste right and made me sick to my stomach. My friend got the fish and chips and could not finish it, the fish tasted so off. Not coming here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wareham,2.16,2.16,2.16,,2.16

She took our cups away and we had to stop her and ask her if we could have refills. We also weren't asked if we wanted desert. Now I know most of you are probably thinking ""well why don't you just ask the waitress yourself?"" Well all of this is basic stuff your waiter/waitress should be asking you anyway, and if they're not, they need to up their game.

I absolutely love the Southern charm burger.  My daughter gets one burger and I get different one we cut and each eat 1/2 so we can try others but still get our favorite.  Same with the fries.  Then we get the HUGE mile high mudd pie.  Yummy. We ate almost 1/2 before we gave up.  So sad to leave it uneaten.   As usual this Wareham location was delicious.  Not one issue.  I can see why it is so busy.  Management is great. Waitstaff is very competent.  Someone is making sure the orders are correct before they get to the table.  No need to apologized for orders being wrong.  Very well run location.

I asked for a knife to cut my burger was told none were clean and the waitress never came back. Borrowed a knife from a nearby table. We have yet to be offered refill on endless fries to date. I keep trying but this place is just not good all around. I later reviewed my bill and was charged for a nearby tables children to play on the table console which they mixed up table numbers on. I called and they refunded that but it was crazy. Pay attention to ur bill. I do like honey mustard sauce here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wareham,2.28,2.28,2.28,,2.28

I myself prefer shoestrings but that's just me . I also ordered the onion rings which I thought were lacking flavor. Ten to fifteen dollars for a burger  you would think the place would be outstanding. I definitely will not be in a hurry to go back.
