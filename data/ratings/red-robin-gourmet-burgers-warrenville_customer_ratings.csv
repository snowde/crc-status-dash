47,Justine M.,"Chicago, IL",31,512,140.0,3.0,2012-02-15,"Like most, this location is clean and friendly staff. I've been to red robin for years but it's not my first choice. Standard chain food. They have endless fries which are kinda pointless cuz people fill up with one basket.  I do like that they have healthy alternatives. I got the salmon sandwich wrapped in a lettuce wrap and substituted fries with a salad. No charge. Bad thing about their lettuce wrap was it was too thick - too much lettuce. I tore off some peices but then ended up eating my sandwich in a mess, coudln't even hold it up. It's healthier but not as easy to eat...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warrenville?start=40,3.64,3.64,3.64,3.1160000000000005,3.6400000000000006
70,Tessa G.,"Naperville, IL",91,95,48.0,4.0,2012-02-20,"I have always been a fan of Red Robin. In High School, which isn't too far behind, I visited this location NUMEROUS times before and after movies. It is one of my favourite chain restaurants and I have always been satisfied. For some odd reason, I went without Red Robin for a good 4 years. I have recently changed that. This location is always clean, fast paced, and friendly. I went here two times within two weeks about a month ago. GUILTY. The two times were on weekend night (Fri/Sat). The first Friday visit had a very short wait and we were given fast and friendly service. I tend to get the Crispy chicken tender salad, which should always be accompanied by the sweet poppyseed honey mustard dressing. This salad is effing huge. It's like, excessive. I remember back in the day when they were little sweetie pies and had half sizes available for this salad. This was righteous; I consumed just as much, more was gone from my plate, and I was paying less. Oh well, now I'm forced with a true battle each time it arrives. Me versus 'THE SALAD!. You could split anyone of their salads. I am head over heels for the little bread squares they give you along side of the salad. Of course, the biggest downside to this is that you don't get those delicious bottomless steak fries that come with numerous menu items, you will have to order these separately. PLEASE, ORDER THEM, then pick up that cute little bottle called ""house seasonings"" and sprinkle a bit on top. You will dig it. Their burgers are good, but I've only had bites of the burgers that belonged to the past people I have gone with. Blue Ribbon Burger and Whiskey River BBQ stand out most to me and would be the ones I'd order for myself. I love their clucks and fries and they are often my next choice if I don't get my salad. If I get the clucks and fries, I get a cup of their tortilla soup which is delicious. Oh, that huge onion ring stack? Are there three people at your table? Good talk, ORDER THEM.  Their freckled lemonade is also a divine option, along with most other drinks on their menu that includes some sort of pureed deliciousness at the bottom of the beverage. The problem? That it is like $5...I don't know, that's just too much for me to pay for something like that. Knock that down to $2.50 and you've got yourself a deal. Overall, I end up throwing Red Robin into the mix here and there when trying to conjure up restaurant ideas. If you're in the area before a movie and want some American Fanfare, snag a bite. You better not forget your balloon on the way out. Common, there is no age limit on balloons, don't feel sheepish, grab your favourite colour and get outta there! OH and writing this review, totally is making me crave some Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warrenville?start=60,3.64,3.64,3.64,3.184,3.6400000000000006

The Mac and cheese was warm around the edges and ice cold and very watery in the center. She only took one bite. My wife's burger was fine but half of my fish was raw. I spoke to the manager and asked if they put a piece of ice in the Mac and cheese to cool it off as I explained our problem. He said they would never do that on purpose then got very defensive and kept repeating that it would never happen ""on purpose.""  No replacement or remedy was offered. RR used to be great about correcting any issues, especially with kids meals. Very disappointed with this location and it's management. Our server, Fonzie, yes Fonzie, was nice but couldn't find the manager after the food came out and we noticed the floating macaroni in ice water.

I went during lunch and just stuck to the lunch menu, trying to keep my costs down, but still ended up paying 19 bucks. So be weary that there are cheaper options out there. On this occasion I got the chicken caesar wrap with clam chowder soup. Clam chowder was the one recommended by my server. I can't believe I'm complaining about this, but I thought it had too much clam. My other friend works at a different Red Robin and she said the chicken tortilla is their best one so I must try that next time. The wrap was good, had a burger the night before which is why I didn't get one this time and that was probably a dumb choice but oh well. Got the freckled lemonade which is why my total was bumped up to 19 but I think I got my moneys worth.

69,Rick F.,"Naperville, IL",0,27,,1.0,2015-06-24,Absolute worst experience ever. I ordered food at 9:40 I showed up at 9:50 and the doors were locked so I started knocking as employees walked past and stared at me. The door said open until 10pm. I reached in my pocket to call and realized my phone was in the car. So now I walked back to my car got my phone and my first call was at 9:55 there phones were turned off. Hmmm so now I have two choices leave with out the food or stand and knock on the door that should be opened. Finally some one opened the door with an attitude like a what do you want attitude? I got my food and and asked for a manager. I asked why you would lock the doors before close when you knew someone was picking up their food. His reply was I just locked the door and our phone was not off. I called him on speaker and the phones were certainly off. He also said I knew you where coming because I made the food myself. Which was a direct indication he was unhappy with my late order. I did not know what time they closed and if it was such a nuisance they shouldn't take the order and close earlier. I wasn't planning on complaining about my experience until I got home and realized the order was not right probably because they cleaned up the kitchen early and did not want to get things dirty.

Food - 3 stars  Service - 2 stars  When teens ask for burgers and fries after a long day of shopping, Red Robin was on the brain so we made a beeline to the closest one. Needless to say, they knew their order before we sat down or before we pulled into the parking lot. So, we ordered quickly.  One of them was relatively thirsty which means the lemonade was drank in no time. Our server said she bring another and never did. And we never received any water. The burgers arrived and I then noticed we were without a knife and napkins. Additionally, the person who dropped off the food noticed my sweet potato fries looked as if someone had eaten most before they were dropped off.  It took a bit longer for the lemonade refill, a while for a normal serving of fries. I ultimately walked over to the bar to get napkins and silverware on my own. After all, the food was getting cold.  You can use the screen at your table to pay for your meal which explains why service is sort of DIY. ....

My husband always orders a burger and is usually happy with his order but I like to try something new each time--which I guess is a mistake since I rarely ever have anything good (their poutine was godawful when they had it). The only consistent thing has been their onion rings. But on several occasions we have ended up scoping out other tables for condiments because the one we had was empty and our waitress is nowhere to be found. The last time we were there we were given no utensils or napkins, and again the waitress was MIA. Another bothersome thing is that they always try to sit us at the bar and when we ask to sit in a booth the hostess always gives us the dirtiest look.

40,Jonathan S.,"Naperville, IL",0,1,,1.0,2016-04-12,"I went to this place in the January of 2015. My experience was so bad that I felt compelled to come here and post it as a review over a year after the actual experience. Here's what happened: 2 friends and I (~26 years old) show up for lunch on a Sunday to get some burgers, drinks and watch a Blackhawks game. When we arrive, we are seated in the closest booth to the door despite a mostly vacant atmosphere (two or three 40-50 year old groups). Like I mentioned, it is January so we have quite the draft coming through and are very uncomfortable. The server comes over and we all place our drinks order (3 beers and 3 waters) and an order for an onion appetizer, as well as ask for them to put the Blackhawks game on. Our server says they will comply to the hockey request and process the order.  15 minutes pass and we have received no drinks or food. We contact the server again and repeat the order, as well as the TV request. About 5 minutes following this re-order and subsequent apology, we are served our appetizer. We start to eat, but quickly all get thirsty and realize we have no drinks. Also, the Blackhawks game has started while SportsCenter remains the viewing program on all TVs. The server comes back around for round 3 and this time we start asking questions: 'where are our drinks?' (we are so thirsty) 'what happened to the Blackhawks game?' (score of game scrolls by on bottom line). As we are asking questions, another server comes up to our current server and asks if current server needs help. He insists everything is all and well and that he needs no help. He leaves the table without saying anything to us.  Somehow the bartender gets the message to make the beers, pours all 3, and leaves them on the counter to be served. The next 10 minutes are brutal, mainly due to our extreme thirst. We still have not received waters or beers, and we can actually see the beers sitting on the counter across the restaurant. Our server is just bouncing between the other 2-3 tables and has completely forgot about us, for the third time. While this is going on, the bartender realizes these beers have been poured for 8 minutes but not served. The head of the beer has dissipated and the beer glasses look 2-3 oz empty as a result. I will never forget what happens next; the bartender puts straws in the beers and stirs them so that foam will be reproduced, and to make the beers look full once again! Quite hilariously terrible actually. I tell this part of the story all the time because this is such a heinous act - destroying a poor beer to make it look full again.  We flag down our server for the 4th and final meeting. He arrives and asks, ""Can I take your order?"" We almost burst out laughing. ""No thanks. We will just take a check for the onion."" He now realizes that we have been there for 30 minutes and have received no drinks (waters are nowhere to be seen... at least we saw the beers). He looks back at the stirred beers and asks if we want them. We kindly suggest that we do not want the beers any longer. He goes through apology round #2, we tell him its OK, he gets the check, and we leave to go to Chipotle on the way home. I've never bought a drink from Chipotle for a to-go order before but I did on this occasion due to the whole thirst situation from the Red Robin. The Chipotle was great per usual, but just could not make up for the extreme thirst, lack of entertainment, and overall poor experience that I received going here. I give this one star instead of 0 because it made for funny restaurant horror stories over the past year. Never again going to a Red Robin.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warrenville?start=40,3.24,3.24,3.24,,3.2400000000000007

Nothing like having a nice sweet expectation and biting into onion. Upon leaving we discovered that my son had sat in something and the seat of his pants were covered and we don't know what. In following up with the manager we were given his business card and told we could come back with the receipt for the dry cleaning. I don't know what world he lives in or what kind of restaurants he's managed but that's not exactly the best method of dealing with this want to customers was food sucked and his clothes have been so oiled. While it was a nice gesture to pay for the clothes to be cleaned three Audi is certainly could've given something else such as a credit for our current meal and we would just take care of the dry cleaning.
