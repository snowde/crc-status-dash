Gps got us lost and never found the address. Seems to be because it is a brand new shopping center it isn't on gps. Stopped to ask for directions and finally found it. We were ten min late for our reservation and our family of 3 that drove there after work from Newtown was turned away. I could see turning away someone after 30 min or so, not 10. They didn't care whatsoever when we explained the situation.

59,Lizann D.,"Warrington, PA",4,20,4.0,4.0,2015-06-12,"Finally got a chance to try Red Robin after hearing great things about their burgers. And mine was great!  But at $14.99 one should expect a fabulous burger. My first time there was a Wednesday evening and there was a 40 minute wait. Spotted two empty spots at the bar so we grabbed those and ate much sooner. Two HUGE flaws; First issue, the place is too cramped on the bar side. The back of my bar chair constantly got bumped by staff and patrons walking by.  Second issue was how hot it was in there. We were melting. The staff behind the bar was sweating like crazy. They asked the manager to turn up the air to no avail. Staff relayed to me that the dining area is always freezing and the bar area is always hot because of a design flaw.  They work on tips behind the bar. What kind of tips can you expect when the place is too small so people eat at the bar and because it's hot they order water instead of a cocktail.   Second time we went for a late lunch, around 3:00 because I wanted to try again and see how the place felt when not cramped. It was much cooler. Service was fast. Much more enjoyable. I will come back here for a burger for sure but probably take-out or late afternoon meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warrington?start=40,2.544,2.544,2.544,2.544,2.544

We've been to Red Robin at other locations a couple of times before and weren't too impressed.  But it's right down the street from us at this location, so we decided to give it a try.  We were pleasantly surprised. I had the Genisys burger and hubby had some kind of burger patty melt.  He also had a cup of chicken tortilla soup.  Our waiter, Stephen, was perfect and the food was hot and tasted very good.  All of it.  Even the fries.  I had forgotten that the fries really are both figuratively and literally bottomless.  As in don't pick up the cool little circular container they come in.  It's truly bottomless so the fries fall out. We liked everything about this visit, and will definitely return.  Hope the quality of the food stays consistent once the restaurant is no longer so new.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warrington?start=20,2.548,2.548,2.548,2.548,2.548

They took it back put bacon on it and now the burger was cold. The server was nice but soooo slow. A manager had to get my partner another beer and more fries.

The endless pit of fries came with very little and when asked for more they didn't come out until we were finished our burgers.

21,Samuel C.,"Glenside, PA",1,13,37.0,4.0,2015-07-18,"We can't complain, we had great service and the burgers were well made. It was interesting being divided into people who were 21 and older, but it felt nice in a way. We ate the $5 Red's Boneless Wings in Teriyaki Sauce, Fiery Ghost Style Tavern Double and the BLTA Croissant. All three were delicious and we had no complaints. We also had a free dessert, because we are part of Red Robin Royalty, which you should definitely be a part of. The Fiery Ghost Style Tavern Double is definitely a burger for those who can handle some heat and the BLTA Croissant is for those who enjoy something less greasy than a burger. Other than this, the fries were good and so were the sweet potato fries. You really can't argue too much about a Red Robin. It's just a typical Red Robin chain restaurant. There is a lot of parking available and lunch time is a nice peaceful time to go. The service was good when we went, but I guess that depends on the server and day.

We sat at the bar, bartender was nice, the general manager (the Asian lady) was around and spoke with all the guests and the food was pretty good.  But the last experience I had with my friend was absolute shit. I mean enough to ruin it to the point where we will never come back. To any red robin for that matter. I would give negative stars if I could.  For a burger and fries joint, those are THE two things you really can't afford to mess up. Yet they did. Cold burgers. Cold fries. I asked for no salt. Of course it was extra salted. Like COME ON. I emphasized it over and over. and why the hell does it take 30 mins for my ""bottomless"" round of fries to come. We were finished with our burgers before the second round even came. Is that how they try to skimp you out?

And no one in that restaurant has any idea of what customer service is. I hope they didn't have a night manager it didn't look like they did. Being a manger I would never let anyone treat customers like that. You help till the end even 5 min before closing.

My son also played two games on the store tablet , which where clearly marked as free. However, we where surprised when we received our check that our waitress Alexa had charged us for an extra milkshake for 4.99 and an extra 1.99 for entertainment. I would NEVER recommend going to this red robin. Our waitress Alexa was misleading and scammed us of our money. When asking for a refill on our milkshake, Alexa told us we should order from the store tablet, later telling us that in order to get an unlimited refill, we would have to ask for a tin. We had no idea why Alexa charged us for extra, when we ordered an unlimited milkshake and she had never mentioned an extra charge. When asking about the extra charge, she said we had ordered two milkshakes, rather than one unlimted milkshake  which was outragous when she knew we had ordered ONE unlimited milkshake. Be aware when ordering at red robines.

Fairly easy to find coupons online & they have always been accepted. It would have got a 5 star if it was not for those annoying terminals - touch the thing to check your order or anything and it seems to charge you a $3 usage fee.  The staff are always fine to take it off but it also kills conversation at the table when kids are playing games that did not require parent authorization to add to the bill,",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warrington?start=20,2.68,2.68,2.68,,2.68

When the waitress finally came over, I reminded her that she forgot about my napkins and she rolled her eyes! This place gets a meh two stars at best.

The appetizers were brought out quickly and were delicious. I ordered the burnin' love chicken burger with a gluten free bun - I simply ordered the gluten free bun because I like it, not because I actually have an issue with gluten, however, they took it very seriously as if it were an allergy and also did not batter the jalapenos inside the burger.

We're busy, so we don't get to eat out very often, and my hubs and I were both restaurant people for many years- so we know what goes on in the industry, standard expectations and reality alike. We had a bad first experience at our first visit to any RR when we went to one local to us. We had just about decided that we were never going again, but we were in PA visiting friends and this location was by a wal*mart where we stopped to pick up a few things. We were in about 2:30 pm yesterday- way after the lunch rush. In many restaurants, this is a time when service and food can be less than stellar. However, that was not the case at this RR.  Amy F. was our server, and she was fantastic, friendly, and very attentive. We didn't have to ask for a thing. She did a great job of explaining the menu and specials, since it was our first time at RR in a long time, and only our second visit ever.  The food was prompt and fantastically delicious.

I noticed other servers in action. All seemed very patient, professional and attentive to their customers. If there had been poor service in the past, that issue clearly has been addressed, at least when I was there. The food was okay for a chain place. It in no way compares to the local independent pub in the area. The burger had a better quality, pre-prepared, fast-food quality, unlike the fresh-made type of burger I am used to getting.  However, for a chain place, it will do. I give the food 3 stars based on what I ate, which was a burger and fries. Not bad but not exceptional compared to what I have access to at the same price.

While frank helped and was nice the waitress really put us in a horrible mood, the last thing that should happen going into a restaurant.

It was super greasy, you could actually see grease puddles on the burger when the roll & rest of the toppings fell apart, which was before I was able to take my first bite. Not what I expected from a restaurant burger. It was served with a very slim handful of fries that were soggy & not good at all.  The spinach / artichoke dip wasn't too bad but not great. Also it was only served with a small amount of nachos (not enough) & some celery -? Interesting. Red onion was chopped on top which was unusual. I didn't mind but luckily the rest of the family wasn't with us because they would NOT want anything served with onions.   The kids menu doesn't offer mac & cheese as a side so we ordered that as my daughters entree & the portion size was only that of a side.

The patties aren't very thick, and there was something odd/cheap about the lettuce and tomato. My burger fell apart, like the patty was broken in half when I received it.  Service is great.

I think the service was far above and beyond. Just wanted to say thank you Alex.  The food today was great. I got my usual choice of the Bleu burger and it came out fantastic today.
