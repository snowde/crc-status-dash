105,Aly K.,"New York, NY",56,186,1.0,4.0,2012-01-03,"Went in because the commercials finally got to me! It was PACKED for a Monday night, but it was a holiday, so it makes sense. We opted for the bar where we could sit down right away and were instantly asked for our drink order.  Let's stop and talk about something for a minute. Most places have unlimited soda refills. Red Robin has unlimited Root Beer float refills. For real? Too bad I only saw them after I ordered, but the guy next to us was sucking them back like he was Edward Cullen and they were a Grizzly Bear, so they must be good. I ordered the Guacamole Bacon Burger, but opted for the turkey patty instead of beef. My main squeeze ordered the Prime Chophouse Burger. Both were delicious and cooked just the way we wanted them. He got a salad with his and it was big for a side salad.  The bar staff was friendly, and while busy, on top of their game. I will definitely go back and try some other items off of the menu...::cough:: root beer float ::cough::",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warwick-2?start=100,2.416,2.416,2.416,2.416,2.416

There was no I'll be right with you, no can I help you, nothing. When she came back without so much as looking at me, I actually had to ask her if this was where I would place my take out order, if only to remind her to do her job. The food was good, but portions were kinda small for the price.  We enjoyed our burger, salad, and sweet potato fries, but my son's grilled cheese was way below average.  I had a delicious drink while I waited for the food to come out, freckled lemonade. The bartender was nice, not very attentive though since I sat for awhile and had to ask for a drink instead of being offered service.

Did I get a sandwich at Walt's Roast beef for half the price that was more filling just 12 days prior? Yes. That's where the problem is. I had never been to a Red Robin before but it was practically right there upon leaving the Warwick Mall cinema. If you like a snack, but want to feel like you cheated your stomach out of a better deal this seems like the ideal place. The burger my friend got did not seem any different than the chicken sandwich I got... besides the obvious.  Service was great, place was busy, food was done right.

130,Ted D.,"Elmhurst, Providence, RI",37,79,3.0,2.0,2012-04-06,"Very disappointed! Our server was quite nice; but appeared overwhelmed on her 2nd night. While it wasn't her fault, felt rushed & ignored while we were here. No silverware when we sat down, she relayed kitchen was working to remedy. Took drink and food order. App arrived before drinks delivered by a runner. A manager stopped by to ask how the apps were before we had even had a chance to taste and it was more of a walkby because was already asking another table before I had chance to answer. The waitress arrived and apologized for delay, explaining someone behind us had an allergic reaction and she had to report it to a manager for a report to be filled out. She had just moved on to next table she had drink order for when another runner had our entrees, less than 4 minutes later. I HATE that! The waitress came by again to apologize, check that we were ok, ask if we'd like another drink and would be back with them & was gone until I was done with entree and actually set for check.  The food-for all the commercials & money in other advertising, I have had better burger at mom & pop places around town for far less cost.

We got seated within 5 minutes of arriving though which wasn't bad. Our waitress came right over and took our drink order and since we knew what we wanted we placed our burger order too. Although the service was a bit slow the staff was very friendly and the burgers were very good. I was stuffed when I left and definitely had no room for dessert. I don't know why the reviews are so terrible - it's a burger place and much better than any fast food joints around.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warwick-2?start=140,2.6,2.6,2.6,2.444,2.6

100,Lisa D.,"El Dorado, AR",61,38,,2.0,2012-06-15,"I just finished my second visit to Red Robin. I think it will be the last. It's not good enough for an adult night out, and too expensive for a kids-level meal.  The service is average, while the decor is equivalent to a rough collection of mismatched treasures amassed by the weird older brother of your middle school crush.  Trappings aside, the food is just not that good. The fries are bottomless, but who wants more pale, dry steak fries? The toppings have mild flavor, but the most painful taste offender is the burger. There is something unsavory about the meat... It has very little/ no beef flavor, and the texture is a sponge-like, as though it were a firmish cake rather than a beef patty. I'm not sure it's 100% beef, honestly.  At about $10 for the burger and $2.50 for a soda, this felt like a rip off.  And now for a phrase that has never before crossed my lips: ""Go to Applebee's instead.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warwick-2?start=100,2.48,2.48,2.48,2.2800000000000002,2.48

Well, it's mall food. If you accept that going in, it's decent food. I had a burger with an egg on top, pretty good but nothing exceptional.

(I personally would go to TED's Montana grill or 5 Guys for a burger.) This last time not only was the last for even my nephew. His burger came to him RAW, my friends prime rib sandwich was a joke filled with tough meat and grizzle. The garlic fries were soggy and had that fake minced garlic from a jar. We sent back the burger and the prime rib sandwich ( I sent back the fries because I do not wast my time on bad food) telling them the problem.  Now they don't comp anything but they bring another burger for my nephew and friend ask for a burger instead, plus give us some more of there all you can eat fries.

And I was hungry. Red Robin was right there, its so damn convenient.  Well, the Red Robin Tavern Double is only available ""well done"".  So I get the Red Robin Gourmet Cheeseburger, medium please. With a name like that, I am expecting something special.  What i get is an overcooked, still juicy but flavorless burger served on a stale bun.  Its garnished with a bit too much ""Tavern Sauce"", instead of the advertised Mayo and Pickle Relish, which wasn't too bad, but couldn't save this burger.   We also ordered a Tavern Double, which came out the first time cold.  A second attempt was brought to us promptly, without any fuss, and was quite a bit warmer but certainly not hot.  It was not anything special. The best thing on the plate were the seasoned Steak Fries.

89,Tony S.,"North Smithfield, RI",4,7,,1.0,2012-08-18,"Let me start off by saying this rating applies to this location in Warwick RI only as I have had good experiences at other Red Robin locations... I was originally going to review this Red Robin after my first visit which was a very disappointing experience, however I figured they were newly open at the time, new staff so screw it give them another chance or two to win me over, well they haven't. I went in with my family yesterday late afternoon approximately 4pm and the place was slow, very very slow. We were greeted at the front door immediately by the hostess however we had to have her repeat herself a couple of times because the music was so loud we couldn't hear her over it. She seated us promptly and that is where the problems began, I ordered a diet coke and it tasted bad, not like diet coke at all, but I figured OK their mix must be off no biggie happens all the time, any way we placed our order and my son need to use the restroom, so we walked to the restroom, as we rounded the corner we were greeted by a staff member sprawled out in a booth sleeping and continued on our way to the restroom. The restroom was clean however just before traditional dinner time on a Friday evening you should probably ensure your restrooms have paper towels to dry your hands with, as both machines were completely empty. as we walk back to our booth past the sleeping staff member I remember looking at the table thinking wow still no food, considering the place was empty and  our order consisted of 2 burgers, a corn dog for my son and chicken fingers and ribs for my daughter.  When the food arrived the disappointment really set in, Myself, my wife's, and my daughters fries were cold... not warm, cold to the touch cold. Both mine and my wife's burgers were also cold, actually the only thing that was close to hot was my sons corn dog which was actually over cooked but at least it was warm for him to eat.  When the server came back to ask how we were doing we told her of the issues and she went to get her manager, I will give the manager credit as she was very apologetic didn't charge us for anything (not for nothing if she didn't waive the prices, except my my sons corn dog, I would have flipped out as nothing was eaten) But anyway she showed concern, apologized, offered to re cook our meals, and gave us a coupon for 2 free entrees and 2 free kids meals, which we will probably never use. I don't know how this location is so bad and the others I have visited are vastly better but the lack of quality control, and staff control at this establishment reflects poorly on their management.... remember management you can't get away with having to comp food all the time",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warwick-2?start=80,2.32,2.32,2.32,2.34,2.32

The restaurant was able to accommodate a party of 4 at 12:30 on a Sunday afternoon fairly easily, which I attribute to the newness of Red Robin finally wearing off.  We were seated at a very clean booth, and what I appreciated most was the lack of clutter that's seen typically at chain restaurants: various drink promotion cards, the drink/dessert menu, gift card promo cards, salt/pepper, ketchup, malt vinegar...the list goes on. Our waiter was quick to come to the table and get our drink orders, and was attentive without being overbearing. For lunch, I opted for the Souper Sandwich Combo - for roughly $11 you get a full sized sandwich and a side soup. The BLTA (BLT plus avocado on a croissant) was surprisingly tasty. Like really tasty. The bacon was crispy, the lettuce was very green and fresh, tomatoes were sweet and juicy. I was in total shock over how good this sandwich was.

86,Kristin P.,"North Kingstown, RI",0,4,,5.0,2013-04-14,"I've read a lot of bad reviews for this Red Robin so I felt the need to leave an awesome review.  First off, we have always enjoyed great service whether in the bar (awesome if there's a wait for the dining room) or in the dining room. Our favorite waitress is Emily and she has an amazing memory - she remembers us and our order every time! She also is one step ahead of everything you need like drinks, dipping sauces or fry refills. Recently we started getting their new spinach dip (which is amazing) but beforehand we got the fried zucchini and mushrooms (also very good). I am a fan of their royal burger (no pink due to digestion issues). The one time it was accidentally served with pink, they took it back no fuss and replaced it in no time with a hot, juicy, perfectly cooked burger. I also love their whiskey river BBQ chicken wrap. It's always the perfect combination of crunchy tortillas, hot chicken and cold lettuce and tomato with just the right amount of sauce. My fiancé loves the bonzai burger and the royal burger. Their fries are always hot and seasoned very well.  We actually don't go that often due to traffic around the mall, but I'd say we go at least twice a month. Sometimes we just want takeout burgers and go to Five Guys which is closer. However, we still love Red Robin.

However it would  not be wise for a company not to piss off a former service woman..definitely not  a good look but the  meal and service was great. Though the place was busy as hell,the waiter was attentive and friendly.  Yesterday I was starving before I wanted to stroll over to Macy's so I stopped by.( Getting my free birthday burger is another plus) I was greeted with a smile by a really sweet hostess. We talked for a little bit and waited for the waiter. My waiter came over...yea wow....tall, killer smile, hot (and hopefully single lol )..he would have been flawless  but for the Red Sox shirt he was wearing,but everyone working there was wearing one so maybe there is hope. Anyway when I was done drooling over my waiter, I believe the manager came over and sat down at my table. He was so adorable. So nice.  We chatted for a bit. He took my order and I waited for my Banzai burger to be made. I used to frequent the Wareham location and even the one in Milford CT. Cooking a burger is pretty simple. I like my well done which is simply leave on the grill until it's fully cooked. For some reason the other two locations can't figure that out, my burger yesterday was on point. Everything was awesome . Seriously, I felt like they rolled out the red carpet for me yesterday. It was crazy. I've been to some high priced places and I can say not one place has treated me like they did yesterday at a burger joint. A really hot waiter was the perfect touch too. In all seriousness, I was more than taken care of and I really do appreciate it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warwick-2?start=140,2.6,2.6,2.6,2.9320000000000004,2.6
55,Kris W.,"Westerly, RI",63,359,1557.0,4.0,2013-07-23,Red Robin is definitely worth the hype.  I'm only deducting 1 star because I'm not sure how their burgers are gourmet. I didn't know Red Robin was a sit down restaurant until we entered.  There's a full bar & flat screens all around so it's easy to catch a sporting event.   I opted for the special Berserker burger which is available for a limited time.  It came cooked medium as I had ordered & had a little kick.  I was expecting it to be a little bit larger than it came but it was enough to satisfy without making me feel like I had gorged myself.  I washed it down with an awesome vanilla malt milkshake & the other half of my wife's burger. All the employees we encountered were extremely friendly & my son walked away with a Red Robin balloon.  I will definitely be back to try more burgers & can't wait for the fall & the return of their Sam Adams Octoberfest milkshake!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warwick-2?start=20,2.68,2.68,2.68,2.7359999999999998,2.68

Well, I do. Red Robin passed that test, but it was just ok. The food is truly mediocre at best. The service also leaves a lot to be desired. The waitress was nice however it took awhile to seat us in the almost empty restaurant, the food also came after a prolonged wait and our drinks were not refilled until we were just about to leave.

We both ordered burgers and fries.  I could have dined at a five star restaurant and got my food faster.  Once again, the waitress apologized and stated that they messed up on one of our hamburgers??  Oh and my friend asked for her hamburger to be well done and it came back pink.  I am guessing that her hamburger was the one they messed up and after we asked when we would be receiving our order, they rushed it through. Believe me, we did not even make a fuss, but it was so apparently bad that the waitress sent the manager over to apologize.  He wanted to give us a hamburger to take home which we declined.  They ended up taking 10% off the bill.

In any case, things went much better this time.  The food was hot and delicious, the waiter was friendly and attentive, and when the fries took longer than anticipated coming from the kitchen he popped by to let us know that they were on the way and he hadn't forgotten them.  Really, that's all it takes to keep us happy.  We don't abuse our wait staff and don't ask for much- we had one refill each on beverages and fries.  Even if we hadn't had the gift card, we would have left much more satisfied this time, and chafed less at the price, since we really felt like we got our money's worth this time.

It took us about 2 minutes to be seated. Our waiter Chuck was Great. He was very friendly and very accommodating.  We ordered onion rings for appetizers they were delicious, wife ordered a burger and I ordered a bacon burger with bacon. While looking at the menu, I noticed they sell those cool glass cups, I ask chuck if I can buy a few for the house? How much are they? Chuck replies "" $ 3 or $ 4 let me ask my manager. Chuck comes back states they dont have those glasses in stock, they have the coors light cans. I ask him to show them to me. He does, I say what the heck their $4 bucks let me buy a couple.

So I lift the bun, I look and guess what NO BACON!!! So I ask Chuck did I order a Bacon Cheesburger he says yeah. I lift the top of the burger wheres the BACON??? Again here comes the Manager, I know what he was thinking half the burger is gone this guys trying to pull a fast one. Manager says do you want BACON, I say no its ok not a big deal, he says well I will only charge you for a Cheesburger.  So after getting home and jumping on my laptop, I am thinking.

For starters, I asked for a blended margarita and they brought it to me on the rocks. Not a big deal, I can get over that. Then, it took about fifteen minutes for me to get my appetizer while there were servers standing all around us gossiping which made me feel like no one was concerned about my food. The bartender sink was filled with trash and dirty napkins while the bartenders stood there talking about things I didn't care to hear. When my burger finally arrived after waiting for twenty minutes, it had a hair in it. So I had to send it back and wait another ten minutes before I could eat. My girlfriend ordered the French onion soup and it was literally all cheese and hardly any soup. Very disappointing.

But from experience, I'd rather sit in the bar area, where there are less errors! This was our first time in the dining room. During my most recent visit my server was new and was polite.  However, it took 3 tries to get an actual seltzer for my boyfriend (she always brought over different ones - first time it was tonic). When I advised that tonic was different she explained she didn't know the difference.  Then, I asked if they had the wings with the bone-in, not boneless. She explained they only have boneless. I then pointed out wings and chips and asked what the difference was. She explained that there wasn't any. Then I questioned her on that it seemed different...and she advised that she was mistaken and they do have the wings with the bone-in but you only get 4 of them. My boyfriend really wanted to get them so I did so.  She only charged us $5, meaning we could had done the actual one that I requested for $9 and probably would had more wings.   She also questioned me when I told her it was my birthday and she pretty much doubted me. She explained it would had automatically popped up in the system if it was my birthday. I advised her with the email and my birthdate. She also had to get her manager to figure it out. Her manager advised I was unable to get a free black angus order and just took off the most she could on a burger. I advised that it was okay. Our waitress never apologized nor wished me a happy birthday. She was argumentative when it came to the wings.  The service there was very slow and it was a Sunday and quiet. We waited over an hour and a half for just our food to come and never any updates besides one; because of the burger you ordered it takes longer. There were never any updates. A request for another seltzer took at least a half hour for one seltzer.   Also, when the wings came I requested blue cheese - which never ever came. This place can certainly improve as I know they have some new employees. Every table served I heard the manager apologizing for a number of errors from their wait staff.

We ordered an appetizer & meals for ourselves too. About 15 minutes later, our appetizer came out... but our waitress still hadn't brought our drinks over. We flagged her down & she brought them over, then informed me that the kitchen was out of broccoli, so I asked what other vegetables they had & she said carrots so I got those instead. When our meals FINALLY came out, she dropped cold carrot sticks off at my table as my side, when I was thinking they were at least going to be steamed or seasoned or SOMETHING. It's not like I ordered a kid's meal. She never checked on us to see how our food was, & it took her forever to drop off our bill.

Everything was a bad experience and ultimately a waste of my time and money. The menu looks great, but the food that actually got delivered and the quality of service of those waiting on us was horrible.  First, we were seated in the bar area and our waitresses were the team of bartenders, so they were already in a position of disadvantage having two areas to tend to, but that was no excuse for the piss-poor service. Both waitresses conveyed an attitude that we were interrupting their day by being seated away from the bar. They rushed us through our order and missed a couple things in the process.  The beverages came out with foodstuff stuck to the straws as if someone bussed a table and then made my drink. When we asked for a new one, that's where things really turned: we were completely ignored for the rest of the time. Every table around us was checked on but once we raised a concern we were blacklisted.  When the food came out it was well over cooked, sloppy in presentation and took forever. We actually debated walking out a few moments before it arrived. When we got it, it was incorrect and missing anything we added - but they were sure to put it on the check! We stared at the culinary embarrassment placed in front of us for about twenty minutes before the manager (Dave) finally came over.

81,Danielle A.,"West Warwick, RI",0,4,,1.0,2016-02-14,"Before even being sat, my friend and I were asked if we were both 21. I've never been asked this before ordering a drink and it was slightly embarrassing. We were sat in a very small booth directly in front of the door which made it extremely chilly for us, and near the entrances to the kitchen even though there were several available tables. Throughout the meal, I overheard who appeared to be managers complaining to one another about the employees.  It doesn't make me feel good about eating somewhere when I hear that the hostess has been seating guests at tables that were not wiped down. First we ordered pretzel bites, which were extremely greasy. I didn't like the taste of the beer cheese dip but was unable to ask our server for another dipping sauce because the next time we saw her was when she brought out our entrees.  I ordered the crispy chicken tender salad which sounded great. ""...Hard-boiled eggs, hardwood-smoked bacon, tomatoes and Cheddar over mixed greens."" The ingredients in my salad that were NOT listed on the menu were the ones that ruined it. Usually in a tossed salad, you don't notice the cabbage and carrots. At least one fourth of my plate was cabbage. I picked out much of it out and was able to see just how much there really was. After I ate most of the lettuce and toppings, I realized that the entire bottom layer was shredded carrots. At least a third of my salad was carrots. My friend insisted on buying me the chocolate fruffles for dessert even though I was ready to go. The fruffles were not soft as advertised in the menu, but came straight from the freezer. They had far too much salt and the berry dipping sauce was sour.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warwick-2?start=80,2.36,2.52,2.52,1.7640000000000002,2.456
46,Robert F.,"Lincoln, RI",27,8,,1.0,2016-02-14,"I would choose zero stars if that were an option.  We went to the location next to the Warwick Mall complex and it was one of the most disappointing dining experiences that we have ever had the displeasure of enduring.  It took over 45 minutes for our food to arrive, even though it wasn't busy.  Really?  Forty-five minutes for burgers and fries?   The other negative aspect of our visit is that I went out of my way to specifically ask for a PLAIN cheeseburger with just bacon on it.  Forty-five minutes later, my meal arrived and when I bit into it, there were mushrooms, which I am very allergic to.   When I brought this to the attention of our server, she aggressively tried to place the onus on us by maintaining that my sister-in-law must have taken my order by mistake.  My sister-in-law had, in fact, ordered a mushroom cheeseburger and that was what she got.  To summarize, even though only one cheeseburger with mushrooms was ordered, two of them were delivered to our table.  So either this overly contentious waitress messed up the order, or the kitchen did.   Also, not once during this interaction did the waitress ask how I was or express any concern that a customer had been erroneously served a meal with ingredients that he/she was allergic to.  Fortunately, there were no ill effects, but this should not be the attitude and reaction when something like this occurs. Furthermore, arguing with customers, especially when you are in the wrong, is not only bad form, but it is also bad business.  To her credit, once the waitress realized that a mistake had been made, she said a corrected order would be expedited within a ""few"" minutes, but it took another 25 minutes.  Apparently, in Red Robin world, it normally takes 45 minutes to cook a hamburger, but in a pinch, they can expedite it in only 25 minutes. Lastly, they did not even have the business acumen and/or public relations sense to take the offending burger off our bill.  Perhaps I should have pressed the issue, but by that point, I just wanted to get out of there as fast as I could, rather than prolonging the agony. I blame most of this on poor management.  We will not be returning to this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warwick-2?start=20,2.24,2.49,2.49,1.7640000000000002,2.3900000000000006

First, we waited to be seated, and then we waited over 30 mins for food to arrive. My clucks were gummy inside and the mac n cheese was old, cold pasta under hot reheated cheese.. I sent that back and got soggy fries as a trade. I was also disappointed that neither myself or my daughter got offered a refill on our drinks or sides, since we are supposed to get free refills. In previous visits, the refills would arrive without being asked. I noticed the table next to ours received their apps after their main course arrived, and i could tell they had waited quite a while as well.

40,Serge H.,"Providence, RI",0,30,,2.0,2016-06-04,"Red Robin creates quite an illusion in their advertisements. What appears to be big, hearty pub style burgers in their slick commercials, ended up having more in common with chains like SONIC. The Pig Out Style bacon burger I ordered was somewhat small, and average. Nothing to write home about there.  The endless fries gimmick was quite a disappointment too. I'd rather have one decent batch of fries, than get a scant 10 French fries, and then, wonder when I might catch the wait staff's attention to bring me another dose. I did ask for a second helping, and they eventually arrived. Of course, by that point I was long since done with my meal, and ready to pay the bill.   In summation, the food isn't terrible, more akin to a middling fast food burger joint.  Essentially you are paying more for the ambience of the restaurant chain, than a great burger. If I'm going to do that, I'd probably go with a place like JOHNNY ROCKETS, and be much more satisfied with the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warwick-2?start=20,2.12,2.48,2.48,2.3120000000000003,2.3360000000000003

Then after browsing the menu, we ordered some drinks. For a place with only 5 tables, we expected quick service but that was not the case. After finally ordering and another long wait, we received our food-yay? Too bad the pineapple wasn't grilled and the bacon was cold on my friend's undercooked burgers. I ordered some doughnuts, as I just wanted dessert. They were out of berry dipping sauce, and my server told me someone was making more. It tasted like jelly mixed with water, and it was far from appetizing.

44,Josh C.,"Johnston, RI",3,13,1.0,1.0,2016-08-01,"A short preface by saying I have worked food service before so I tend to be more lenient when it comes to restaurants. Tonight's service is definitely up there with poor quality. I've been to this location before and it wasn't nearly as bad as it was tonight. We got there about 7:07p and, for a Monday, waited about ten minutes before being seated in the bar area. I had ordered the red sangria, I generally will only get one drink if I go out for dinner but when this arrived it tasted like watered down red wine. Long story short on the sangria the waitress informed me that it was box sangria. As I mentioned ""when"" the waitress came over to take our order was twenty minutes after we got there.    Despite my best attempts I try not to be terribly picky, especially when something is on the menu, my wife ordered a ""Pig out Tavern Double"" burger with cheddar cheese and fries and myself had requested a ""Southern Charm"" burger in a lettuce wrap with sweet potato fries. Halfway through the wait on our meal, the wait was about another twenty minutes, the waitress came over to inform me that they ran out of lettuce for the lettuce wrap.... yes... they ran out of lettuce. So I told her she could just put it on a plate and that would be fine.   All the while my wife and I are sitting there waiting and our waitress and the other servers are texting, cleaning up for the night it seemed and overall not checking in with us for any reason. By the time our food arrived we had cold fries, and a burger with some iceburg lettuce stacked on top and bottom, where my wife's meal looked like something we could have ordered from McDonald's and it had American cheese that looked like someone just opened up a few slices of Kraft singles. This is far from what I would justify to anyone as a ""gourmet"" burger being part of their slogan.   Around 7:58 our plates had been empty for a while, and yet the waitstaff just keeps walking by us, there are three of them now and not a single one looked over or said anything as small as "" let me get those out of the way for you"". Eight o'clock rolls around and still nothing, finally our waitress comes over to see if we would like a refill on the fries, so we indulge and say sure. Another ten minutes later fries arrive, also cold to luke warm and covered in oil. I could not get out of there fast enough. We paid and picked up to leave. The real kick was on our way out, the hostess was looking down at her phone the whole time and never said anything as simple as ""Have a good night"" or ""Thanks for coming"".  All in all, a ""gourmet"" dinner for two took over an hour and a half to ""enjoy"" with some of the worst service I've had in a long time. I would have bet there were no more than twenty or so customers inside at any given point during my ordeal.  Advice: Go to Long horn right next door, may be a little more expensive but the quality and service is better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warwick-2?start=20,1.92,2.44,2.44,2.436,2.232

Our orders came out about 10 mins later - when it was placed down, the server said ok clucks and shrimp and a burger. I said I'm sorry I didn't order a burger - he said oh I'm so sorry - I see burgers all day so I just said burger, but yes this is a chicken sandwich. Umm ....ok? Is it chicken or is it tuna? =) All in all, the food wasn't bad - chicken sandwich had a nice flavor to it and my niece enjoyed her meal, didn't go for seconds on the fries but what we did get was hot and crispy.

45,Amanda P.,"Providence, RI",0,10,,2.0,2017-03-07,"Just got home from the Warwick, RI Red Robin location. Walked in and as we were being seated I almost fell down because the floor was so slippery. I'm not sure if the floor was wet or just washed, but there were no wet floor signs so I'm assuming that the cleaning products used just made the floor slippery. I ended up pulling a muscle in my back and in my arm from trying to catch my fall. The hostess asked me if I was okay right after, I replied yes because I was pretty much embarrassed that I was falling in the first place. When I sat down, is when I felt the discomfort in my back and arm from the potential fall. The waitress came over (which I'm sure she saw my fall because she was in the kitchen, which we were seated near) and didn't ask me if I was okay, she just wanted to take me and my friends order immediately. I could tell she was a little annoyed. We had no idea the kitchen closed at 10 pm we walked in at 9:05 pm, we also asked the hostess prior to being seated if we were too late to come in because we could have gone somewhere else that was open close-by. ANYWAY, I wanted to order a vegetarian/vegan burger, but didn't see anything listed on the menu because I felt so rushed (and the menu's design is super confusing and clustered). So I had to go with a salad and fries. I am lactose intolerant so when I received my order I saw cheese on the garlic fries I was a little surprised (again because I felt rushed and didn't read the menu thoroughly), and also found 2 pieces of mac and cheese in my HOUSE SALAD. I pushed the shredded cheese off of my fries, but I wasn't totally positive all of the cheese was off. I didn't want to make a big stink because my friend and I wanted to get out of there and as I said earlier the waitress was annoyed. Towards the second half of our experience the waitress was nicer than she was (most likely because a family of 3 came in at 9:43 pm and she didn't have a reason to be annoyed with us anymore). Moreover, I'm glad I have a couple of Lactaid pills at home so I don't feel sick tonight, and a heating pad/ice.  Sorry for the bad review, but I had to be honest.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warwick-2?start=20,2.08,2.45,2.45,,2.3020000000000005
43,Cuitlahuac G.,"Woonsocket, RI",1,25,,1.0,2017-03-19,"This was our first time at Red Robin, and I wasn't impressed and will never go back. The burgers are ok, what do you expect from a chain. They are over priced for no reason, the endless fries are a joke. The unlimited refills on drinks is a joke. The service in this location is horrible, and I know it because I watched people get up and go look for food and drinks so it wasn't only my experience. I received 6 fries with my burger, 6. I ordered lemonade with my drink and I got a cup of ice with some lemonade. I asked for a order of fries and a refill of my drink and the waitress went to go clean the booths that were already clean and walk around. At the time we had about 4 empty booths around us and that's what everyone was concerned about. About 10 minutes after I was done eating 7 fries and a drink magically appeared and we just wanted to leave. At several points of the evening all of the waiters and waitresses just disappeared somewhere. That's when several tables went looking for food. We received our food before other tables that had already been sitting for a while. So I wasn't impressed at all I will stick with my usual spots for burgers, I can get better quality for a third of the price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warwick-2?start=20,2.08,2.44,2.44,,2.2960000000000003

He was always checking on us and giving us drink refills and getting us more bottomless fries. The food was very good as well.

76,Jenelle L.,"Warwick, RI",2,8,13.0,4.0,2017-05-02,5-2-17 went again today. Giving cheeseburgers from a chain restaurant 4 stars feels weird. But  I have to give credit where credit is due. Big Tavern cheeseburger is my go to along w/ spicy ketchup for the bottomless french fries (I have never actually wanted more than I was originally given) Ok so it's no Kobe beef. But for an average of $8 or so you can't go wrong. Never had an issue w/service. You can do everything from you table if you'd like (ea table equipped w/those order/pay devices) Bar area has multiple TV's showing more sports shows than I knew were on in the afternoon on a Tuesday.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warwick-2,2.28,2.47,2.47,,2.394

73,Mike C.,"Rumford, East Providence, RI",2,44,,4.0,2017-07-15,"My family and I first encountered a Red Robins while vacationing in PA, circa early 2000s; so we were quite excited when they opened a location at Patriot's Place, especially the more proximate Warwick location. Their menu is just as good as we had remembered, with numerous choices, at a really good price. My favorite is the Blue Ribbon burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warwick-2,2.16,2.46,2.46,,2.34
65,Kelly F.,"North Providence, RI",170,309,45.0,5.0,2017-08-13,They always cater to ours son's allergies and keep him safe. The customer service is top notch at this location. The fries and chips are always endless. We usually get the wings (so tasty....) and split a burger because how does one eat a whole one? The manager and servers are super friendly and attentive.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warwick-2,2.32,2.47,2.47,,2.41

63,Colleen M.,"Providence, RI",23,180,20.0,3.0,2017-08-25,I had to revise this review after a very positive experience we had today. My older son loves burgers and has been dying to try the place. Our server was so friendly and accommodating. I loved the fact that they were able to make changes to the menu and didn't charge for every little thing which in my experience is common at chain restaurants. My husband and I were able to have our burgers with a side salad for no extra charge. I guess we could have even gotten a refill but we didn't need it. My younger son got a kids burger   with extra toppings and there was just a small charge for bacon. The other one had soup on the side of his burger for an extra $1.59. The onion rings were terrific and we all loved our burgers. So unlike my last review I thought it was a good value and the food quality was better since my last visit.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warwick-2,2.52,2.48,2.48,,2.496
60,Robert G.,"Newport, RI",76,470,673.0,4.0,2017-08-28,"OK, I usually hate chains..., I came here because we needed lunch and we were going to watch a movie nearby and I wanted a burger... Red Robin has a really catchy ad program right now and I went after the Siracha burger. I got the Bigger tavern patty, with an order of onion rings to split with the wife. Wife wasn't too hungry and only went with chili cheese fries... 1st, the onion rings are awesome, served with ranch and a chipotle ranch or something like that that should be called ""crack sauce"". The waitress was nice enough to bring me another cup of it for my fries... The place was really clean, table was nice sized, and the little trivia game was pretty fun for me and the wife to play while we waited...  I hate to admit that I really enjoyed this place. The burger was actually decent, as good as a burger from Five Guy's, in all honesty, cheaper too... The wife's fries were huge, and she only ate about half..., I had unlimited fries with my burger, but I barely made it through half mine as well... Service was good, place was clean, meal was cheaper than Smash Burger and Five Guy's, you get a fun little game, and great service. I hate to admit that this chain is pretty good...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warwick-2,2.64,2.51,2.51,,2.5620000000000003
69,Antia P.,"Warwick, RI",294,41,23.0,5.0,2017-09-16,"If you go, I'm telling you, you NEED to ask for Justina as your server. She works weekends. Justin's was very knowledgeable of the menu/deals, professional and attentive. Literally, the best service I've had in a long time. They didn't have what I wanted in the menu but the chef still made it for me. I wanted a BBQ pulled pork sandwich with cheddar cheese and jalapeños. Only place that makes it the best is Umelt but literally this sandwich was better than any I've had in a long time. The tangy BBQ accompanied with the fresh jalapeños really did it for me. If you go during the week, as for Erika she is great too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warwick-2,2.76,2.54,2.54,,2.628

61,Amir S.,"Boston, MA",282,21,12.0,2.0,2017-10-02,"My wife and I decided to eat out on a Sunday evening and we've been wanting Red Robin for quite sometime.We all know that the photos and videos are never the same as the real thing, so we weren't looking for anything like a 5 Guys. I ordered the double and the meat just didn't have that beef umph to it. Could have been the burger I ordered.  Little things make me tip waiters. I wanted ""lots of lemons"" in my water. He didn't bring back lemons. I never said a word. I also told him I was super hungry and really wanted some endless fries and a beer while we waited. He brought the beer but no fries - and we still waited. No fries. Our infant daughter was with us and we asked for steamed carrots in place of the fries with her fish stick meal. Her plate came out with - FRIES. No carrots. My meal finally came out. After we ate our dinner, I let the waiter know about the fries, lemons, and steamed carrots for the baby. His reply? ""Awwww. Okay."" It sucks that we tip 20% no matter where we go. It's like throwing away money for not-so-good service. In actuality, it's the establishment that my wife and I patronize, not necessarily the waiters. However, I wish all waiters and workers at these established companies would represent their companies a little better than they do.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-warwick-2,2.96,2.52,2.52,,2.696
