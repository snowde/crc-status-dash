What makes this particular location above average is the service. I popped in here on a drive to Vegas with my mom and sister for a lunch that would give us some time to eat and relax, but not keep us long. Our server was fantastic. She took my 10% off check in deal with no problem and was super friendly, and made sure she had everything right. She checked in the perfect amount, making sure we had what we needed and that everything tasted OK. She was even nice enough to get my mom a club soda for the road. I really like the food here, and the service was top notch.

I thought I'd try the southwest chili burger they had been advertising as a special.  It didn't come looking like the picture, it was smaller, and didn't look appealing, but the burger was juicy. It came with never ending fries and well, one serving was enough.  Overall, service was good, I enjoyed the burger, not the additions.  Perhaps I need to try a different burger?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-washington-2?start=40,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000003,2.8320000000000007

But our service was a joke. Nicky or server seemed to have no interest in helping us she refilled or drinks but we had to ask another server for more fries. We got those refilled once and I was threw.

We chose it last minute and were in our wedding attire (yes, I was in my Dress). They Promptly seated us, made sure my booth was clean, and gave us a nice corner that fit our large group. They were so helpful and kind to us during our meal. The staff was friendly and on top of things. Our Burgers were absolutely delicious! I got the mushroom burger and my husband got the guacamole burger. Both were very well made.  To top off our amazing service, they brought us out dessert and had beautifully written congrats on the plate with chocolate and strawberry sauce. It was so thoughtful and we were excited!

72,Christie L.,"Las Vegas, NV",1070,859,6639.0,4.0,2013-09-17,"We dropped our car off at Discount Tire and it wouldn't be ready for an hour, so hubby and I decided to see what was nearby to grub on. This Red Robin is right next to Discount Tire so we decided to just eat here. Walking in we were greeted and taken to a booth, menus were brought and drink orders were taken.   Looking over the menu there was a lot of options at reasonable prices. I ordered a cup of ""French Onion Soup"" priced at $3 and a ""Mini Wedge Salad"" priced at $3 as well. I asked for the salad first and the soup for my meal. The salad came pretty quick and looked great. The mini wedge salad had a chunk of crisp lettuce that made the perfect bed for the blue cheese crumbles, bacon, tomatoes, crispy onion straws and dressing. For $3 this salad is a winner. The French onion soup was a whole other story. When our server, Angela, brought out hubbys burger she didn't have my soup. She said that they had to make a new batch of soup and it should be right out. Well, hubby ate his whole meal and I still had no soup. I watched as Angela waited at the kitchen and kept asking them if it was ready yet. Finally I saw someone walk over and pull my soup down from under what appeared to be a heated lamp. The cheese on top of the soup appeared to be overcooked (probably from sitting under a light for too long) and the cheese was so melted/hardened to the cup that is just wasn't good. The soup however did taste good. It was filled with many onions and the broth has a good flavor. They had the usual bread in the soup (that bread was good) and a rock hard piece of bread on the side of my cup was not necessary. Hubby enjoyed his burger. Many of the burgers come with bottomless fries! So, with your first check-in on yelp this location offers 10% off your total bill. Just make sure and check your receipt to make sure you get it! I showed the offer to our server, who then took my phone over to her manager for approval. She came back to the table with my phone and said it would be applied before she brought the bill. Because of the issue with how long it took to get my french onion soup they said the soup would be taken off of the bill. They still put it on the bill, but as a substitute for the bottomless french fries that came with hubbys burger and charged $ 1.79 for it! WTH?!?!?! I was told that since it was already rung up they couldn't do anything. Really?? I really enjoyed our server and a majority of my meal, but with the soup fiasco and not honoring the discount, I could not give this place any higher of a rating and feel generous giving 3. The total w/o discount and being charged for the soup was $15.42 so I couldn't see arguing about a 10% discount. Not too many times can you to go into a restaurant where 2 people eat for that cheap. ***UPDATE*** After receiving my e-mail as well reading my review on yelp, Dan, the manager for this Red Robin location reached out to me by phone (gave my number in the e-mail) immediately. He remembered my husband and myself and said that the server should have told him about the yelp discount not being on the check as well the french onion soup. He said that my soup wasn't to his standard or mine. He said he appreciated my honest review and that he really cared about us coming back in the future. I let Dan know that it meant a lot to me that he would reach out and talk to me about my experience and that hubby and I would for sure be back when passing through town again.  I want to leave my original review because it was still an experience that did happen, but wanted to make the immediate update about why I changed my rating to 4 stars and that the manager did reach out to make things right. I hope everyone will give this Red Robin location a try!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-washington-2?start=60,2.544,2.544,2.544,2.544,2.544
71,Marc S.,"Las Vegas, NV",199,292,4099.0,4.0,2013-09-26,"I'm surprised I haven't eaten at Red Robin until now. If you love burgers this a good spot. I ordered the Burnin' Love burger that cost just over $10 and came with bottomless fries. The burger had fried jalapeno, salsa, pepper jack cheese, tomatoes and chipotle aioli on a jalapeno-cornmeal kaiser roll. This burger had awesome flavor and was a good size. The fires were huge and cooked just right. I did go for another round of fries and think it is a cool deal how you can keep them coming fresh and hot. My wife had a salad that was presented well and she enjoyed it very much. When it came time for her main course that was different. I finished my whole meal before she got hers and when she did it was overcooked. We also noticed when checking in on yelp that you can get 10 percent off your meal. Our server said it wouldn't be a problem yet we weren't given the discount. The server said since it was already rung up it can't be changed. My wife's meal was also supposed to be removed from the bill for it being overcooked and served so late yet it was on the bill. After writing her review the manager reached out to her and said our visit wasn't up to his standard and intended to make things right. I was hesitant to come back to this Red Robin because of feeling like I was getting taken by them when it comes to the bill, but because the manager reached out and seemed sincere, I would give this location another shot.

Try the Royal Red Robin, Guacamole they are great. Seafood - we are actually known to have great fish. Ive tried it and I really like it. We have people come in ALL THE TIME for fish and chips!

I can't eat to,auto products and the relish they use has it in it! Who knew! But they figured it out and fixed it by totally redoing the order so it was fresh and hot. We asked for more fries and received two large orders, not the one old stale thing we expected and it was there Johnny on the spot! The other staff was friendly also.

I had it emptied completely even before finishing our appetizer and asked for a refill.

This location absolutely ruined the experience for us. We arrived at 6:57pm and waited at least 40 minutes before being seated, the greeter apparently forgot about us when we were sitting in front of him the whole time. At least 4 other groups that came in after us were seated before us. When we were walking towards our table we noticed that there were more than 8 other tables available. Once seated we ordered right away and waited another 15 minutes for our drinks. Our server was nice and brought us our bottomless fries while we waited for our food, and thats the last time we saw her, even after asking for ketchup and her saying she would be back with it. We waited up until 8:45 and my pregnant wife decided it was time to go because of the ridiculous wait time and noticing everyone that had came in before and after us had food on their tables and the horrible service at this location. My family left outside and i waited at the front to at least pay for the drinks and fries. Even after that whole fiasco i was made to wait another 10 minutes for a different server to come out and tell me they'll take care of the drinks and had the audacity to say that our food wasn't even on the grill anyways so they wouldn't make me pay for the food and when i asked where our server was she magically disappeared and wasn't there. In total we were there a little over 2 hours. We don't like causing problems and certainly don't want anything for free when We're able to pay for it, but our first and only experience at this location was a joke.

17,Coleman S.,"Saint George, UT",4,4,17.0,1.0,2017-03-04,"Here's the short version of my review; if your party is higher than the fingers you have on your hands, don't bother coming here. I don't remember the specific time we checked in, lets say around 6 PM, but our party of 16 were told it would be a half hour to forty five minute wait. This is understandable and acceptable, it isn't often we get to have this much family here in St George and we always love going out on these rare nights so this wasn't our first rodeo. A half an hour goes by and the other table of 16 seated were still eating dinner, so we were told it was another wait. Possibly an hour total. Again, understandable as this is a busy Saturday night in St George. Listening to the host in between talking among ourselves I'd hear ""party of 4"" ""party of 5"" etc. They can probably sit in a booth and aren't going to be in a huge table like ours. Again, understandable. Then I noticed a table of nine being called. Then the BAR TENDER, not even the host, decided to come on up and let a party of 11 take the table we had been waiting for this entire time. More high party tables were being seated before us. This was close to the two hour mark. They finally got to seat our party... Of about 6 people. I'm glad we managed to whittle it down for them because I know counting can be very tough when you have the mind of a child in an adult body. Speaking of children it was sad to see my young niece and nephew be so good and wait patiently to get to eat with us be turned away because it was just getting too late for them to stay up. I decided to leave because I wondered if they couldn't even seat our party like any other restaurant is capable of (which we've done many times) how can I trust them to get my order right, to have good service?

38,Edie T.,"St. George, UT",6,6,,5.0,2017-05-06,"Red Robin is our go to date night, every Friday, unless we're out of town. Best restaurant ever! For those complaining about waiting? Yes, because it's great! That's the reason for large parties, hands on Managers and Servers! As soon as you walk in the door, you are greeted by friendly hosts, placed on list. They ask for your phone number to notify you when your table is available, and seated accordingly--size of party, area...they accommodate your seating wishes, and also need to set up tables to accommodate larger parties, including all the sports teams that frequent this area.  The service is excellent, as well as the extensive menu variety, full bar, balloons for kids, chalkboard which kids and parents love to write on while waiting for tables.  Management is full on track, as well as the servers! The food is freshly cooked, great burgers, salads, fish, full bar varieties.   Seriously, we don't understand the lower than Five-star rating. You won't find any other A-typical restaurant in this popular area, St. George, Washington City. We are regulars, because of very impressive first class service, cleanliness, food and bar service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-washington-2?start=20,2.96,2.96,2.96,,2.96

Our server was friendly and when we placed our order I told him I was using my Yelp check in 10% off coupon.   He did come around to check on our orders but we had a hard time tracking him down for our check.  When he showed it to me on the screen on our table, there was no discount.  He said he would come back and fix it.  After 15 minutes and no waiter, we paid the full amount and reduced his tip.  Service is so important these days and he didn't live up to easy service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-washington-2,2.72,2.72,2.72,,2.72

The way the burger came was perfectly grilled and the bun was broiled made the place suck so much.

1,Doro P.,"St. George, UT",0,81,17.0,2.0,2017-10-10,"We'll, I think as far as the competition, this Restaurant may have a leg up. But that's not saying much, given the lack of quality burger restaurants in the area. Our service this week was okay, but we were told the crew was short-handed on the particular evening we visited. Folks! Get rid of the Ziosk consoles at the tables!!! People prefer good quality service, versus interfacing with a tablet or electronic device. Give it up already! I'm trying to give this place some love, but it's hard to do when your burgers are served raw, the replacements take forever to arrive and the dessert you ordered is stale.  Wait! The tower of onion rings were good.

0,Betty W.,"Saint George, UT",0,41,,4.0,2017-11-08,"Have it your way doesn't always exist! Having lived here for many years I have heard every excuse under the sun to keep me from getting a burger the way I WANT. Red Robin is flexible. Vegans are welcome. They have turkey burgers, they also have fish! Being so particular I have learned to be courteous and nice before I order. I try to get everyone on my side about how I want my burger (responsibility all mine...triconous too!) cooked. Manager, waitstaff, cook...only if they can do it. If they can't do it my way I will order something else. Amazing when everyone is vested on getting it right.  Praise, smile, and tip when they get it right. We have had a few mediums end up well done (oh boy) and a begged for rare end up too pink (oh no). I give Red Robin 4 stars for stepping up to the challenge and getting it right more often than not. Reading complaints always interest me. Particular, specific diners need to accept some responsibility when ordering...do you want bun toasted? No cold or soggy fries? Want your waitstaff to smile and be good humored? Give a smile. Think through your order before you place it. Be specific. Want something left off? Tell them they are not mind readers. Give staff every opportunity to get it right. Yesterday kids were out of school...this is a very family centered restaurant. No complaint from me. I opted to sit at the bar. Had a great Cod on a bun. Waited with a coffee and basket of fries (endless) while my order was completed.  Cost lunch under $20 (hate the billing, entertainment machine that in reality puts someone out if work under the guise of speeding service...if I wanted speedy service I would fast food it or eat at home...diners are not fooled). The establishment is clean as are servers and restrooms. The plating of food orders is enticing to the taste buds. I was alone, however multiple parties had little or no wait at 1in the afternoon for tables. Noise level was contained with children's voices on the other side of the restaurant. I could still hear the TV and other patrons on the bar side could talk without raising their voices. My bartender server was attentive while still fulfilling drinks for the waitstaff. There were also other patrons eating at the bar. She kept her poise and her smile.  Do join their loyalty club if you enjoy Red Robin. Be a good guest where ever you go. Speak up before hand to get what you want the way you want. If substitutions can be made good...if not you know ahead of time and can decide whether to stay or leave. Everyone should have an enjoyable dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-washington-2,2.88,2.88,2.88,,2.88

This is the 3rd time that I've been and they sat me right away but after I order it always takes 40+ minutes to get my food. Look it can't take that longer to throw on some extra burger patty's.

3,Dustin N.,"Logan, UT",47,25,5.0,4.0,2018-01-01,"Went in to Red Robin for a little bite to eat for lunch. When we got there we were greeted by the host Vince. He said it would be about 20 minutes. After about 35 minutes we were finally called and after following him back at same time as a family that just got there with the same name, he just looked at us surprised and seated them and said we will be soon. We returned to the waiting area for another 14 minutes and were taken to our seats. We first were taken to a booth when we asked to be seated at table originally. The correction was made and we were seated at a table. Our waitress came and took our drink order and when she returned we all started small talk.  Our waitress, Teresa, did an amazing job and really helped us and requested the right entrees for us. We ate and the cod was really tender and good and the Red Robin burger was perfect with the over hard egg and the camp fire sauce for the burger and fries.  By the end of dinner the day was really good and the food was worth it. On the way out the young man Vince made an effort to apologize to the females of our party and what a mistake it was.  This was my first time eating here and the one place I chose going through town and I will come back again.
