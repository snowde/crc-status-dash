24,Travis T.,"St Marys, WV",1,1,1.0,4.0,2012-01-30,"Great food great service, if stopping here it's in the same plaza as Walmart not the address listed so don't follow gps!! Drove all the way across town to end up at someone's house, but when we called they gave us good directions to the restaurant",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-washington?start=20,3.152,3.152,3.152,3.152,3.152
21,Troy F.,"Canonsburg, PA",16,31,9.0,2.0,2012-10-15,"Very average.  Unfortunately the service was awful; and the food was not up to par.  I am going to attribute this to the Washington location only, as I have had much better service at the South Hills Village location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-washington?start=20,,,,,
25,Don K.,"Washington, PA",1,15,,1.0,2013-08-08,"How can a chain put ""gourmet burgers"" right there in the name of their concept and serve those compressed frozen beef pucks is beyond me.  I don't care if they do have fifty million combinations of slop to top them, the burgers are weak.  This is everything that is unappealing about the ""chain mentality"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-washington?start=20,,,,,
19,Eric M.,"Follansbee, WV",0,57,,2.0,2013-08-12,"Went here with 5 other adults and my son on Sunday.  Your typical good Red Robin burgers but our waitress seemed mad that we were there disturbing her day.  She gave my son a cracked glass (albeit, plastic) that leaked.  When I told her about it, she just grabbed the glass and walked away.  At least give me a hollow apology.  She gave us refills without us needing to ask, though several of us hadn't even gotten halfway through our current glass and then didn't take the empty glasses away.  I will definitely go back to Red Robin, just probably not this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-washington,,,,,
22,Tom G.,"St. Clairsville, OH",1,2,,4.0,2013-08-16,I love there burgers. They recently changed there unlimited fries to smaller portions. Love there salads too.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-washington?start=20,,,,,
13,Funtime P.,"Pittsburgh, PA",42,307,1031.0,5.0,2013-10-01,"These are some of the best burgers I have ever had. It's always busy and you get endless fries with different types of sauces to pick from ! They also have delicious seasonal sides like Pouting Fries. I tried their new Mac and cheeseburger,  it was good! They fried donuts are also a treat!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-washington,,,,,
20,Rezin H.,"St. Clairsville, OH",4,9,1.0,3.0,2013-12-18,We have always had good food here.  Campfire sauce is the best.  Kids menu selection is limited and somewhat tasteless.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-washington?start=20,,,,,
17,Scott W.,"Washington, PA",3,3,,5.0,2014-11-02,"Very clean,great service. They get your orders right an in a timely manner. I'm a frequent visitor. So the staff remembers my name. The food is great. If you happen to order something, an go back an get the same thing. It'll taste just like it did the first time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-washington,,,,,
15,Brennon O.,"Bozeman, MT",2,76,44.0,4.0,2015-04-11,Always good food and service.  So happy we KNOW what to expect and....actually get it.  Only drawback is the noise level.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-washington,,,,,
18,Courtney K.,"Morgantown, WV",1,7,1.0,4.0,2015-05-09,Noise level is crazy loud even when there was hardly anyone inside. We were seated at a table near the kitchen... Next time will asked to be moved... Would have gotten 5 stars but we really disliked the fact that almost every waitress was complaining and making fun of their customers. Food and service was good and something we always expect from this location. Just disliked the 'chatty-ness' of wait staff.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-washington,,,,,
16,Michele K.,"Dublin, OH",2,12,,1.0,2015-07-11,I just ordered fish and chips to go. The fish was slightly over cooked. The fries tasted like onion rings. I had to ask the server for condiments. Forget to ask her for napkins and silverware. Not a good carry out experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-washington,,,,,
7,Drew M.,"Tulsa, OK",56,136,75.0,5.0,2015-12-13,"This Red Robin is officially my benchmark comparison for all Red Robins.  Food was good, service was attentive, and the place seemed clean. *My benchmark for this chain is now this one!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-washington,,,,,
12,Natasha S.,"North Bethesda, MD",5,23,20.0,5.0,2015-12-26,"The food was amazing here! We have eaten at a Red Robin before, but this one just seemed better.  Our server was probably the best server we have ever had.

10,Aisha W.,"Pittsburgh, PA",55,21,25.0,4.0,2016-02-15,"Found a 2 for $15 deal online & had to place an order for pick-up after some late night shopping! Went to pick up my order, but arrived a little early. I got 2 burgers, 1 for me & 1 for my fiancé. By time I got home I had to heat them up a little,but I expected that from the car ride home. I still enjoyed my tasty burger though. The only thing I didn't like, was that it came with chips instead of fries. The description of the burger on the menu did not say that it came with chips, so it was a little misleading. Before I heated my burger up, is tasted a couple chips & they were very soggy. That was disappointing since I couldn't eat them at all. Other than the soggy chips, the burger was amazing! I will be back for more & next time I'll dine in!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-washington,,,,,
5,Dene D.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,17,56.0,4.0,2016-03-03,"Agree with Drew M. Excellent franchise location. Friendly staff... Awesome burgers. I like sitting in the bar at this locale... Just a comment about some of the other reviews - 1) if you come to a burger joint and order fish, wtf is your problem?!? and 2) of you order take out and then have a significant drive home, are you shocked that you'll have to heat up the food?? Again, wtf is your problem!?! Also, I think EVERYTHING comes with fries, not chips... Never had a chip here what so ever.. Sure you reviewed the right place? Trust me, if you come to Red Robin wanting a burger, which is what they do, you will not be disappointed at this Washington PA location..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-washington,,,,,
6,Jason L.,"Powell, OH",0,8,1.0,2.0,2016-04-19,"Gourmet Burgers and Brew- they say!     First off- Brews are all standard Chain beers, nothing local      Burger- was OK , if you like buns and condiments. "" where's the beef?""      fries- where very disappointing, reminded me of the old Wendy's fries.    Server was very nice and energetic.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-washington,,,,,
11,Nate C.,"Prosperity, PA",0,13,,4.0,2016-05-06,"Great food, and prices that aren't actually much more than you'd end up spending for a family at a fast food joint. The waits are consistently long, so don't go if you need to get anywhere right after. Still, it's a fun place, and everyone is excited whenever we decide to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-washington,,,,,
14,Kamron S.,"Moundsville, WV",0,29,8.0,3.0,2016-06-10,I stopped in on a trip with my family the staff was nice and reasonably attentive the atmosphere was fun with interesting pictures and things on the wall the food was average not bad but not great the desserts and milkshakes were really good though and if your more of a burger fan than me this is a good spot it was clean and well kept and I enjoyed the experience,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-washington,,,,,

3,Matthew U.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2086,1447,650.0,3.0,2016-09-26,"Weird thing about this place is that I had excellent service here, but my family had some of the worst service they ever have had at a restaurant, and we were all in the same party.  After a day of shopping we decided to stop in here for a bite to eat.  We were seated rather quickly, but things went downhill I suppose after that.  First, the table they sat us at was just awkward.  Five adults and one child at a table that could have sat twelve or more.  The square tables that have the drop leafs to make it a round that also make you feel further away from your family while having a conversation in a loud space.  It was kind of like wasted space that could have better served a larger party. I decided to have myself an appetizer that does not appear to offered anymore.  It was broccoli that was lightly breaded and flash fried.  Turns out to be a rather oily mess, but quite delicious with having ranch dressing as a dipping sauce.  For my main fare I just get what I usually get, a Royal Red Robin burger. Here is where the service differed, everything that I ordered I received and within a good time frame.  However the rest of my family would have to ask multiple times for their items, or have to send back because they got the wrong things.  That then ended up with me finishing my meal extra early and put in that awkward position where you're not trying to stare at other people's food as they eat, but you just end up staring and building a short live relationship with someone else's fries.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-washington,,,,,
8,Tina F.,"Wheeling, WV",0,25,3.0,2.0,2016-10-15,"We have been to this Red Robin many times. But tonight, I turned to my husband as soon as we stepped in the door and said ""let's go somewhere else"". The noise was unbelievable high. We were both really hungry and decided to stay. We did not have a long wait and were seated in a small booth. Immediately, my husband and I had trouble talking to each other due to the extreme volume of the noise. And to top it off, the short time we were there, there were 4 outburst of singing and clapping happy birthday. The food: spinach dip was as usual.... yummy!!! Although, we have notice they have down graded the size of it as they have done with the fries. Our burgers were... meh.... My husband said his was the driest burger he has ever that there and mine had dry spots around the edge. Our waitress, was not what I call friendly. Even she had trouble hearing our order due to the noise.  She was not attentive and never did smile at us... Ok, maybe she was tired, but being pleasant to your customers is imperative to me. I doubt if we go back, strictly because the noise made this a not so pleasant dining experience. In fact, when we got outside, even with traffic noise, it was quieter than inside the restaurant!!! I told my husband, next time we wanna go out and eat, we should go to Sonic and eat in the quietness of our car!!!!!  Sorry Red Robin... Ya lost 2 customers tonight.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-washington,,,,,
1,Misti M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",116,182,133.0,2.0,2017-03-29,"While out in Washington we were looking for a place to grab a quick dinner and drink and ended up at Red Robin. The bar area was pretty full but after a few minutes the bar tender took our orders and was very friendly. It did take a while for him to come back with our beer and margarita, but again, there were several people he was waiting on. The front / hostess staff seemed to have quite a few people standing around, but not really pitching in to help the bar area manage the customer load. The food was decent. A california chicken sandwich with fries and a burger with avocado rounded out our order. Both were ok - nothing great but not horrible. I'd say they were both on par for a chain restaurant, but didn't really have anything that stood out about them that would make me want to go back to have it. After eating we waited for a very long time for someone to return but ended up just walking up to the bar to get the bill / pay the tab.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-washington,,,,,

0,Rachel O.,"Morgantown, WV",47,27,24.0,5.0,2017-08-04,"Every time we are in the area, we love to stop at Red Robin! From great burgers to crispy fries to cheesy mac and cheese, they have got you covered. On this particular trip, we started off with the voodoo fries. These are their classic steak fries covered with nacho cheese, bacon, and a spicy ghost pepper sauce sprinkled with fried jalapeno pieces and it is BOMB. Now I wouldn't go as far as to say that these beat Wendys ghost pepper fries (come on, Wendy, BRING THEM BACK!) but they are still a might fine craving killer. Super crispy fries, creamy cheesy goodness, spicy, and crunchy all at the same time? I promise you aren't dreaming. And to top it all off, the side of ranch is great too! Moving onto the main course, I got the prime rib dip and the man got some type of burger.  The prime rib was finely shaved and the sandwich also had carmelized onions, cheese, and was served on a cheesy onion bread that was out of this world. The coleslaw was super crisp and fresh with not too much mayo and the mac and cheese was alright but kind of bland... A sprinkling of the fry seasoning on top made a world of difference! The salad was fresh, and again we got the delicious ranch dressing, and he said the burger was great. If you love root beer floats, GET ONE. That sucker is huge and do I really have to say how delicious it was?  The waitress was awesome, the food was delicious, and we will be stopping back in the next time we are in town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-washington,3.44,3.44,3.44,,3.4400000000000004
