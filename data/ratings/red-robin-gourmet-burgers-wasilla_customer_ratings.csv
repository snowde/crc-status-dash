36,Shawnna B.,"Anchorage, AK",21,19,,2.0,2012-03-29,"I love Red Robin in Anchorage (and most every where else for that matter), but this one leaves A LOT to be desired.  We were seated in the bar without being asked, and I don't mind sitting in the bar, but I would like to be asked first.  The server had maybe 5 other tables and acted as though it were rush hour on opening night.  She was definitely frazzled and it took her about 15 minutes to get our drink order.  As for the food, I ordered a burger and was asked if I wanted it cooked well, or if a little pink was okay.  I said a little pink would be okay, but when it arrived I was only able to eat about 3/4 of it because the rest of it was raw, and once I hit the ""little"" pink, I was done.  I will go again, because I believe in 2nd chances, but from the other reviews, looks like it's more than just a fluke!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wasilla?start=20,2.504,2.504,2.504,2.504,2.504
44,Scott S.,"Wasilla, AK",0,23,,1.0,2012-04-11,The first time I went to this place it was on opening night and the food was served as expected from my experience at other red robin's restaurants.  Service was alright they seemed to be keeping up with the over crowded place.  But my friends and wife have managed to drag me to this place against my will 4 times now.    The first time was amazing then straight down hill we take the slide to going out of business gulley.  The second time i went in we waited for over an hour asked 2 different waiters for a menu or glass of water and finally after an hour we got menu's even on opening night we got menu's right when we walked in.  There were 3 hostess' in the front.  We put in our orders (just the wife and I) and they brought us fries right away I thought ok great.  Well we ate them in a hurry we were hungry and no on came back after 40 minutes they brought my burger and the wife's salad.  She had the nastiest lettuce i have ever seen someone cut in the bottom of her bowl and she said i'm done I'm not eating it.  I ate my burger seemed to be fine.  My soda had been empty and we asked for another of the fries (that are supposed to be bottomless) but they never came finally after I finished my burger we waited an additional 30 minutes and I finally went up to a waiter and said I have been waiting a half an hour and our waiter never came back i want to pay and leave right now.  So we paid left no tip and left never seen our waiter.  The third time i went with my mother.  Told her the service is terrible but let's just get burgers I figured it was a different day different time they wouldn't be busy.  We got menu's right away drinks and fries right away. I was happy.  My mother got her food and I ordered the same burger I always do.  Everything seemed to be ok but after finishing my soda before my burger and my mother doing the same the waiter never came back finally we sat there talking i didn't realize it had been over 30 minutes so i waived at another waiter and they came and helped us right away i left him a cash tip.  My 4th time at this place was my last.  Not only was the service awful but i finally had to get a manager over to our table because my friends burger was so over cooked it was like black carbon and the meat was crunchy.  I wanted it comped and the waiter was no were to be seen.  The manager took it off and was very friendly I left a cash tip for the manager who actually helped us and we left.  If i could get consistent service and food I would be so happy this place seems to be the most inconsistent restaurant in the valley .,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wasilla?start=40,2.436,2.436,2.436,2.436,2.436

34,Michelle P.,"Wasilla, AK",0,3,,4.0,2013-03-29,"Initially skeptical since the majority gave below standard ratings. Walked in with a bias opinion & expected to walk out telling myself ""WTH was I thinking!"" However, I was pleasantly surprised. Being from Cali I've been to several Red Robin locations & this by far was the best customer service experience (I know.. shocking, right?) As soon as we entered we were greeted & seated by the hostess. We asked for a couple of balloons to keep my 2 & 3 year olds busy for a few mins. He asked if we had a color preference, which I found considerate (I'm a stickler for detail & appreciate when its expressed). Soon after he returned with balloons & asked if he should tie loops (again, stickler for detail). Once he left the waiter introduced himself & asked for our drink order. So far everything was good...no potential issues. However, the negative ""voice"" was still lingering on. I scanned the area for cleanliness (tables, chairs/booths, floors...) & everything checked out well. Our drinks & food arrived in a timely manner. The waiter was attentive & polite. He was on top of drink refills & checked in a couple of times to ask how everything was. He neglected to offer more fries, but that wasn't a big deal. The meals were filling as is and it all taste fine. After the bill was paid, he offered new to go drink cups for my boys. Usually, once the bill is paid the waiter is MIA!  Perhaps timing is an important factor; arrived at 11:30'ish with 15-20 other diners already there. Glad the experience exceeded my expectations. Hopefully, it continues for others as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wasilla?start=20,2.512,2.512,2.512,2.512,2.5120000000000005

Fun food, fun atmosphere, fun servers. We've been on the road RVing for over a month now so we've beaten out A LOT lately. And this was the ONLY restaurant that my 1 year old son did not want to touch everything on the table! Which was awesome! He wasn't bored at all! There were lots of colors and lights and other kids to keep his attention. My 1 year old isn't an average 1 year old, he acts like he's 3 so keeping his mind engaged isn't always as easy as one would expect.

32,J W.,"Bayern, Germany",15,5,9.0,1.0,2014-12-16,"I love Red Robins food. shitty service though. The worst thing red robin could have done was put in those little computers. Not a very busy night but our waiter ignored us, never even looked our way. Had to order the majority of our food via the little table kiosk. The folks in the back making the food were far better than our waiter since they were the only ones bringing us anything! Got the appetizers but no plates and only four knives. Hit the kiosk to call our server over, 15 minutes went by before he even noticed it flashing. Saw the server exactly 3 times and the kitchen staff bringing the food would get the napkins we asked for, the forks and plates we needed and of course refills. So riddle me this? When I get the check, why would I leave any kind of tip for the server when everyone else was doing his job. Pretty pointless to have waiters with the table kiosk. All you need is two people to seat folks and point at the kiosk thingy. The people in back bringing the food out can handle it. What a loss.

19,Jeralynn M.,"Wasilla, AK",13,6,,2.0,2015-05-16,"just an update I forgot to post. We received only 3 free sandwich coupons. I was not to impressed with that. When I decided to use it, I went to the bar and gave them to the Bar Tender. She immediately flipped them over and started feverishly reading them. Then she actually smiled and told me I can't use them all at once. I informed her that I received them from an awful experience and was told I may use them all at once. She had the gull to argue with me for a few minutes before she said "" hey look, I can call a manager over if that's what you want, but I really don't think it's gonna help ya"" I stated yes, Please get the manager. After she ROLLED HER EYES, she started yelling across the room asking someone to get the manager "" for this chick"". Enter the Manager I don't remember his name, but he was great. I was only half way threw telling him my predicament when he told me it was fine, asked me if I knew what I wanted, took the order himself, and offered me a free drink to have while I waited. I was very appreciative and he was back quickly with the drink, and food not long after. When I got home, I noticed he had given me the complete meals, not just the sandwiches, Also they had given us a coupon for a free appetizer. I had figured I would have to get the cheapest one. WHen I told him Ill just have the onion rings he told me to get the full order, not the half rack because "" hey its free right?"" He even got me a drink to go.  I wish I knew his name to tell him thank you. Although he was very nice and helpful, I just won't be back. And you can blame the bartender for that one. You have to have an issue to be treated like a guest. The management needs to know what is happening on their floor. Servers need to SERVE, not stand around and gossip. Run the food when it's hot.

I stopped in at 11:15 am on a Sunday morning, so I was one of only two tables. The deciding factor on coming here instead of the nicely reviewed thai restaurant was the desire to have a salted caramel shake. My server was friendly, but that's the only redeeming quality of everything about this place. I asked for a shake and was told the machine was broken, so second choice was a orange cream soda, all out! So I decided on water which thankfully they had. I then ordered and asked for a side of fries before my burger, but no dice. I also asked for extra relish, got none. Later I asked for a side of ranch, never came. My water ran dry, not to be filled up for 10 minutes. It was SO slow! They had people standing around! All of this I could put up with ok if only the service rocked. That is the one thing that the server is always in control of, but he failed today.  Please if you are deciding between here and anywhere else, go somewhere else!

All she was doing was getting up to go ask for crayons. Granted we talked to her about looking before getting up and explained she too was in the wrong but the server's reaction was beyond me.

They had a deer in the head lights look on their faces and I said, ""She (my daughter) was just getting up to ask for crayons.""

Bon Apetit' Red Robin - Wasilla:  **REVISITED TO REVIEW AGAIN** Well, it's been a while since I visited Red Robin Wasilla, so I thought I would try them again to see if I could add a few stars.  Unfortunately the place only reinforced my original rating of one star.  While they did seat us faster, it took 12 minutes for our waiter to arrive at the table. We ordered an appetizer of pretzel bites with beer cheese dip. It took 15 minutes for it to arrive after which, biting into one it was still frozen in the middle. I guess the 'fresh made' pretzel bites didn't hang out in the microwave long enough.  Additionally the cheese whiz cup was about 1/4 full. Of the 12 'bites,' there was only enough cheese for 3-4 of them.  Our dinner order - a cobb salad for me and a peppercorn burger for my guest- took 39 minutes to arrive from the moment our order was taken and was delivered by a busboy.  The burger arrived incorrectly prepared.   This is a 1-star restaurant, and my return visit only underscored the consistency of its poor service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wasilla,2.4,2.4,2.4,,2.4
6,David D.,"Wasilla, AK",25,32,26.0,4.0,2017-09-07,I came when they were training new cooks. My food was sloppy. The burger was greasy and was falling apart. The onion rings were not fully cooked and the root beer float was minimal on ice cream and root beer. I like having extra root beer on the side to fill in the rest of the mug. The floats were not even served in mugs. Thank God they are bottomless,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wasilla,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44

1,B Y.,"Wasilla, AK",1,22,15.0,1.0,2017-10-24,"Ordered food for pickup.   $11.49 for Pub Mac and Cheese.  Looks like a side Mac and cheese to me.  So I call to ask if they got it wrong.   I was informed they only have one size of Mac and Cheese.  Someone can order a side Mac and Cheese for $3.99.   Apparently if you dine in the Mac and Cheese can be ""refilled.""   Their phone person who takes orders should let people know that if you order Mac and Cheese to go you should order the side Mac and cheese.    Won't ever patronize Red Robyn again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wasilla,2.44,2.44,2.44,,2.44
0,Kristen D.,"Anchorage, AK",340,124,128.0,4.0,2017-10-27,"I was never a fan of chain restaurants until I moved to the Frozen North aka Wasilla aka the good food wasteland.  Red Robin is something that I love the consistency of here in Wasilla!  I don't come expecting to be totally wowed, but the consistency of great wait staff ensures that I always leave satisfied. I've had cold food, undercooked food, and food that was totally not what I ordered, but the waiter staff always rectified the situation. So first off kudos to you guys!!  The only real complaint/issue I have with Red Robin in Alaska is the fact that they allow children to sit anywhere. I'm from Washington which has strict laws as to where and when minors can be places, it was always a sacred thing getting dinner in the bar. It makes me upset that the host staff will seat children in the bar...but I guess it's an Alaska thing. It's it because I really dislike kids either, it's because the parents don't work to keep their children quiet and they don't care if their kids are ruining others dining experiences. Anyway, rant over.... I love the bottomless root beer floats and I love the onion rings. As always, I will keep coming back Red Robin, just keep the root beer flowing and the onion rings hot!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wasilla,2.56,2.56,2.56,,2.56

5,Paul B.,"Palmer, AK",65,42,31.0,1.0,2017-12-05,"I usually try this place once or twice a year, but this may be my last time visiting this location. The positives on this visit was the wings, kettle chips and sauce were good. We were seated quickly at a table. The downside was we sat down around 2:10 and it took about 20 minutes to get our fountain drinks and water and about 30 minutes after ordering to get the appetizers and kids meal. Then 35 minutes from the time I ordered a beer to receive it.  An hour and 15 minutes after ordering our burgers come out cold and mine shows some pink and I asked for it with no pink (just a personal preference if it isn't ground at the restaurant) and I can't fault the restaurant on something I didn't send back but I was hungry and wanted to leave. The other order came out on a sesame bun and due to an allergy, we asked that the top bun be switched out. As usually with most waiters he was more than happy to ask the kitchen to switch the bun but that was the end of the world for the kitchen staff member. Our table was one table over from the prep station and it was very clear what was said. ""I can't just switch out the *ucking bun, I have to cook the whole *ucking thing over again. What kind of retard orders a sesame bun with an allergy?"" Red Robin's own Gordan Ramsay continued his tirade for a while. It wasn't clear on the menu which bun went with that burger and we should have specified a sesame allergy. And to top it off none of the requested refills on drinks were received, to include water.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wasilla,2.52,2.52,2.52,,2.52
3,Ariel W.,"Wasilla, AK",0,8,5.0,1.0,2017-12-16,"This is the dirtiest location I have ever been to. I had to walk carefully in my converse shoes to get to my seat, and then the restroom. I almost slipped three times due to how slimy and slippery the floor was. An accident waiting to happen. Then When I got to the restroom while my husband ordered our beer the disgusting theme continued. I went into two separatist stalls before finishing one sanitary enough to utilize. After I got in the one I felt was the cleanest... I stepped in puke. It was brownish red so it blended in( hence why I didn't go to another stall). I used the bathroom stepped on a few wet towels and washed my hands then headed out to the bar seating. Our beers awaited and each of our glasses had hairs on the outside. I had a nice black looking curly hair and my husband had a red one. We showed bartender and she was perplexed on ""who's is could be?""  We left. Staff was not very clean looking. Here was a table behind us full of workers who were on their break, talking heavily about their horrible customer's during their shift. It was horrible. Will not be back!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-wasilla,2.48,2.48,2.48,,2.48
