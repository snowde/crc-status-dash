15,April M.,"Watertown, NY",30,3,3.0,5.0,2017-04-06,We were able to be there for a preview night. The location is small for a Red Robin but it looked like there's plans for expansion.  There's limited parking but there's an overflow parking lot right next to it. We had burgers & hard cider. We loved the bottomless fries & they surprised us with a mint brownie shake. Win! The service was good & food was fabulous. We'll definitely eat there again & recommend them to friends. Management was very friendly & staff was helpful. Bathrooms were clean & had a shorter sink.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-watertown-2,3.604,3.604,3.604,3.604,3.6040000000000005
21,Kelcie F.,"Watertown, NY",0,1,1.0,5.0,2017-04-06,This is honestly my new most favorite burger place of all time. My husband and I were lucky enough to be able to come in and eat for free as part of a training exercise and everything was delicious! I seriously recommend this place to EVERYONE! It'll be fairly inexpensive and it's soooo worth it! Five stars a hundred times over!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-watertown-2?start=20,3.54,3.54,3.54,3.54,3.5400000000000005
26,Paul J.,"Syracuse, NY",1,12,19.0,3.0,2017-04-08,"Lucky to get a preview of the new Red ROBIN (RR) . Full disclosure: I've been to RRs plenty of times and I am not enthusiastic about the place (I have a 7yr old who's a fussy eater but eats off the RR kids menu). Wayback Burger or Five Guys beat out RR burgers any day of the week IMO.  But anyway... Ordering went very smooth. Staff and servers were on top of their game which made the dining experience nothing but pleasurable. Our app choice was the poutine.  It came out first and was very good and I daresay the highlight of the meal (my wife agreed). Gravy is savory and bring together the fries, cheese curds and sautéed mushrooms in a pallette pleasing way. My entree was a bunless Royal Red Robin Burger (RRRB) pink w/Mac N cheese while wife ordered the sautéed Shroom Burger w/ tortilla soup side. After ordering we we offered a complimentary root beer float which was nice. When entrees arrived both orders were as requested. My burger was definitely decent. The egg on the RRRB was perfect for me and you can't get an egg on your burger at Wayback or 5 Guys so have to give RR a point for a more diverse burger menu and overall entree selections. Wife did not like her burger with no real pinpointed reason. Bottomline I like RR enough to come here for the free preview and while I don't regret it I won't be coming back to this or any other RR unless it's just for drinks and apps.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-watertown-2?start=20,3.2760000000000007,3.2760000000000007,3.2760000000000007,3.2760000000000007,3.276000000000001

19,Rayvon N.,"Watertown, NY",1,1,1.0,5.0,2017-04-10,"I would highly recommend this restaurant! The food was amazing and the staff went above and beyond to make sure we were happy with our meals. I had the bacon cheeseburger and it was soooooo good. It was my first time ever eating at a Red Robin and must say, I was pretty impressed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-watertown-2,3.4120000000000004,3.4120000000000004,3.4120000000000004,3.4120000000000004,3.412000000000001
14,Jasmine S.,"San Jose, CA",157,15,11.0,4.0,2017-04-15,"Being from California, there are plenty of Red Robin's to dine at. Coming here, I was excited to see one open because I haven't had it in so long. When I came in, I was greeted and seated very friendly and fast. There wasn't a long wait but I did go on a Thursday afternoon so it wasn't that crowded. Me and 4 others went.  Our server Matt was very friendly and nice when taking our orders. I got the Whisky River BBQ with no tomatoes and when my burger came out, it had no tomatoes AND no crispy onion strings which is one of the burgers special toppings. I didn't care this time because I was starving and wanted to chow down. Red Robin's is known for bottomless fries and I know that when the burgers come out, they come with a couple fries. Me and my friends, went through our fries and asked our server for more. It took a while for the fries to come out and when they did, we basically finished out burger. Now, me and my friends were sitting at a table with about 8 baskets of fries.  All in all the food was good.  The one thing that kind of made me a little annoyed was the woman that kept on coming around trying to get us to sign up for the rewards program. I understand that you are a new business and want to promote but she literally came around 7 times (I counted) to tell us to sign up.  And my friends were adamant that they were going to opt out of signing up but every time she came around, she would get the little Ziosk thing and push it at them encouraging them to sign up.  I would come again but that's only because this is the only Red Robin that's not hella hours away.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-watertown-2,3.248,3.248,3.248,3.248,3.248
27,Chris O.,"Watertown, NY",20,3,,4.0,2017-04-23,"Great food. The place was really busy so svc was a little slow,  but understandable.  Only issue was that apps and main dinner came out at about the same time. But no complaints. Plenty of food for everyone and kids loved it. Will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-watertown-2?start=20,3.248,3.248,3.248,3.248,3.248
13,Ryan D.,"Glen Park, NY",1,1,9.0,4.0,2017-04-29,Good burgers.  Read great reviews on clam chowder- they were wrong.  Wife's fish was fantastic.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-watertown-2,,,,,
8,Holly G.,"Watertown, NY",3,40,26.0,3.0,2017-05-07,"This review is based on two separate visits I made to Red Robin, with two different friends. The first visit was at lunchtime, a couple weeks after the restaurant opened. We were a bit worried that the place might be packed with patrons eager to try out the newest dining establishment in town. But we were seated right away and our meals came quickly. I had the turkey burger, which was perfectly cooked, and served on a whole grain bun, with a zesty chipotle. My friend opted for the Bruschetta chicken, a hearty sandwich that featured a grilled chicken breast, salsa, Provolone cheese and other toppings, served on a ciabatta roll. The ""bottomless"" fries that came with the meals were bland, I thought.  My second visit to Red Robin was for an early dinner on a Saturday. We got seated right away, but the restaurant was packed and service took forever. Even the Lagunitas (an IPA beer) took a good ten minutes to make it to the table. The beer was a notch below average. My friend ordered the Smoke & Pepper burger: a  1/2 lb. of angus beef with cheddar, peppered bacon and  what they call a ""smoke and pepper ketchup."" He told me the burger was okay, cooked as requested, and he could definitely taste the pepper. He did not, however taste the advertised ""smoke"" flavor.  I learned why I'd found the steak fries so bland last visit. They are supposed to be served with a dipping sauce, which wasn't offered last time. Our server's thumb slipped into the cup of sauce as he was serving it. (Ew!) It took awhile for them to bring a fresh one. The tangy Thai sauce DID make the fries palatable. I had the Ensenada chicken, and I was over-the-moon crazy about it! It's two, thin, grilled chicken breasts, drizzled with a salsa-ranch sauce, and served with a side salad. I had a honey poppyseed dressing on the salad, and I devoured every bite of food on my plate! I'd give that entree alone five stars, but because of the inconsistent service, and ""just okay""-ness of the rest of the meals (and ""meh"" ambience)  bring my overall rating for Red Robin down to a 3.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-watertown-2,,,,,
24,Belle E.,"Sackets Harbor, NY",0,24,1.0,5.0,2017-05-30,We HATED this place I'd only been twice in my life before now and it was TRASH. My husband took his kids recently and said it had gotten better so we tried it again. It helped we had been having good experiences since moving to sackets Harbor/ Watertown area. We were not disappointed our server was great the food was a 100% improvement so we will be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-watertown-2?start=20,,,,,

I have nothing to complain about at all. Our waitress was very friendly and assisted us in all ways that she had to. Some of the burgers are very high in price though.

22,Edward W.,"Cape Vincent, NY",0,18,,3.0,2017-06-09,"Went last night,after movie. Food was good,service was excellent. Ordered sweet tea, pretty bland, but $3.00 for a glass of tea seemed exorbitant. Food is ok .prices seem too high. 2 drinks,2 simple burgers...$24.00 Five Guys. 2 burgers 2 drinks fries $ 16.50 just as good with better fries.

10,Andrew L.,"Freehold, NJ",175,117,102.0,4.0,2017-06-17,"A very interesting burger restaurant. First time here and I'm pretty impressed. Greeted by friendly staff, great ambient environment, packed with TVs for entertainment, I truly enjoyed this restaurant.  As a first timer, I ordered the Voodoo fries and the class Red Robin burger. Ordered the burger with slight pink and it was definitely an amazing burger.  I was also a take out customer and the waitress would ask me if I needed any water while I wait, which shows good professional staffing. Really appreciated that kind gesture.  Even though I didn't get to dine in, I waited a few minutes waiting for my order so I got a chance to look around the place. Great modern decor with a separate bar area, this restaurant is perfect for family and friends for a casual meal. There's plenty of parking space, the only thing I would let new comers know if you're planning on doing a take out, go to the bar area to order take out food. I was a little confused at first where and who to talk to for to go orders, so I had to ask around.  Overall great place to go in Watertown! Please do check it out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-watertown-2,,,,,
2,Jonathan C.,"Watertown, NY",1,7,8.0,3.0,2017-07-13,"It was my first time eating at Red Robin today and my experience was average. The restaurant has a very relaxing atmosphere and the servers are respectful. My only gripes were that it took very long to get served and there wasn't a lot of people there either. The food was good, my burger was better than your average burger at McDonald's or burger King. The price is a little up there for what I ate. So just to recap, good service, respectful servers, long wait times, just above average food. 3.7 star rating out of 5. -1 star because ordering can take pretty long. I did not see my drink until about 20 minutes arriving. Appetizer came out about 40 minutes later. (Also they forgot)   -1 star because food was just above average taste, not as good as the hype says. Still is a good place to eat but I don't think I'll be choosing Red Robin over my other favorite local restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-watertown-2,,,,,

I ordered the Raspberry Creamsicle Soda and the Purple Pazazz Lemonade!! Both delicious. Burgers are flame grilled and delicious. Their fries and drinks are bottomless!

6,Bill S.,"Litchfield, CT",155,540,1.0,4.0,2017-08-25,"The burgers and sides at Red Robin are consistently good, and that was the case here, too. But what made this location notable for us was the quality of service: really bright, fun, efficient servers who so comfortably and engagingly dealt with us and a big crowd. We got our order taken quickly and food brought to us right away, and the entire experience was excellent. Red Robin sells beer and mixed drinks, of course, but we like the monster milk shakes, seemingly a bottomless sweet concoction. Add to that crunchy fries, tasty salads and those yummy cheeseburgers. Very nice.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-watertown-2,,,,,

25,Sarah R.,"Watertown, NY",0,2,,1.0,2017-09-30,I've been here two times. The first time I came the food wasn't great but the waitress with the pink and purple hair was super friendly. The second time I got a waitress with dark brown hair who was super obnoxious and rude. A few people in my group ordered drinks from the bar and after 20 minutes of waiting we still didn't receive the drinks. I went to see what was taking so long and found our waitress and a bleach blond waitress being served drinks by the bartender. When she finally came to our table you could smell the alcohol on her breath. The managers are super rude and yell at their wait staff in front of the dining area so everyone can hear. Was a terrible experience I will never come back!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-watertown-2?start=20,,,,,
11,Amber L.,"Clarksville, TN",0,12,2.0,3.0,2017-10-07,"It was ok, but it wasn't worth the price. First, I ordered the veggie burger that was $10 with avocado slices and mushrooms. Only thing, it came with neither the fresh avocado or the mushrooms. So I paid $1 extra for salsa on the burger. It was very disappointing. My husband ordered the royal burger with egg on top. He said it was good, however the patty was thin and tasted liked and looked like a frozen one. The onion rings was super delicious. I am thinking this location has no fresh ingredients other than the lettuce and bread. Gave it 3 stars because for the area it's decent.

This last time I was fortunate enough to be able to enjoy a free Birthday burger! On a busy Saturday night, service was still pretty reasonable.

18,Jacquelyn And Austin F.,"Carthage, NY",1,67,15.0,3.0,2017-11-12,"The food was good but the service was not. We had to wait 40 minutes before being seated which normally wouldn't pose a problem but I ponder why Red Robin did not think to make a larger waiting area. My mother has a broken foot and since all the chairs were taken, we ended up sitting outside on the curb in 20 degree weather. Seriously, there's only about 10 seats to choose from in a room the size of a cubicle. When seats finally opened up, 20 minutes into our wait, we quickly ran to take them before being put out in the cold again. I felt like a packed sardine, smelling the child's dirty diaper next to me whilst listening to the hostesses's hushed conversation. We might as well have been sitting on each other's laps, all 50 of us. I'm pretty sure the amount of people they had signing in for a table who were blocking the door mind you, posed as a fire hazard to the MAX. It was packed beyond belief. I am not complaining about the wait, I am complaining about the size of the waiting area which overlapped with the hostess station and the front door. Our waitress, Jennifer was very attentive and friendly. However the server who brought our food out forgot our order for garlic fries and then brought out the wrong fries altogether. Overall it was an ok restaurant. I'd recommend coming here on a week night for better service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-watertown-2,3.72,3.72,3.72,,3.7200000000000006
