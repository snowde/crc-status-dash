24,Kevin W.,"Enumclaw, WA",0,25,13.0,5.0,2012-07-21,"I went here years ago, but I still remember the visit.  I noticed that everyone working there seemed enthusiastic about being there and were intent on providing good food and service.  The general atmosphere of the restaurant seemed to be friendly and energetic.  Everyone just seemed to be having a nice time.  As for the food, I had a burger and a milkshake, and both were good.  I liked that the milkshake was made out of real milk, unlike some fast food restaurants which have shakes that don't even melt. Anyway, I had a pleasant time, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place to anyone looking for somewhere where the food is good, the ambiance is pleasant, and the staff seem to truly care about doing a good job.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-webster?start=20,2.9320000000000004,2.9320000000000004,2.9320000000000004,2.9320000000000004,2.932000000000001
25,Janice A.,"West Sacramento, CA",65,225,143.0,3.0,2013-05-07,"We were out shopping nearby and my husband was too impatient to stop somewhere else on the way home and so, because Red Robin has never been a disappointment in the past, I caved. I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants, they often ""phone it in"" because they can. People will continue to patronize them simply because they are familiar with the name. As long as they don't get food poisoning, people will return. Which is fine, I just prefer to find the hole-in-the-walls and the local gems.  Red Robin is typically better than most when it comes to quality of food. I'm not a fan of steak fries, but theirs are a decent representation. Their burgers (I gravitate toward the bonzai with pineapple - $9.50) are always fine and definitely filling. Portions aren't out of control but they're a burger joint, so expect a good sized plate of food. Those aforementioned fries are endless, and our waitress was on top of getting us more when we ran low. Which we never actually did, but she was on top of it either way. I ordered a raspberry limeade and for $4 I was expecting more slushy-juice-drink less 7-up. Yeah, they're endless refills, but not worth the cost. Or the calories because I'm sure each glass was a solid 100 sugar only calories but I guess we don't really come to Red Robin thinking about calories now do we. My burger was fine, but nothing spectacular. I was underwhelmed with the flavor, it was very one-dimensional (sweet from the pineapple, nothing to balance it). My husband said his burger (something with blue cheese, which was about $10) was actually quite good but when I asked him if it was better than a few other places, he admitted it was just ok. Which Red Robin is. It's A-OK. Nothing wrong with it, clean facilities, friendly service, over the top decor, convenient location, consistent quality. When you're in the suburbs and too hungry to drive the 10 measly minutes to a much better burger, fine. Whatever. But we're sitting on the sunny patio.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-webster?start=20,2.668,2.668,2.668,2.668,2.668
23,Cat C.,"Dallas, TX",127,213,2.0,3.0,2013-05-29,"Typical chain restaurant, I suppose.  They got parts of my order wrong the second time I ate here, but they gave me some extra fries while I waited, at least, and were really polite about it.

21,James Roswell Q.,"Davis, IL",308,37,26.0,4.0,2013-08-11,"Best burger by far, of all the fast-food franchises. I don't expect perfection.

I have to say that I have NEVER felt so welcome and well taken care of in a chain restaurant. Kate was my server and I made note of her name because she seemed to know EVERYONE and made sure to be friendly to not only every single customer that came in, but the other employees as they showed up. It seemed more like they were friends that worked well as a team then employees. The chicken wings were awesome and the salad was very fresh.  My glass was never empty and I felt like the waitress sincerely cared that I enjoyed my lunch. I will definitely go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-webster?start=20,2.772,2.772,2.772,2.772,2.7720000000000002
28,Nicole C.,"Webster, NY",222,180,18.0,1.0,2014-03-06,"I called today around 12:30PM to place an order for takeout. The first person I spoke with rushed through and seemed very frustrated right off the get go and transferred me over to the person who takes the orders. The next person I talked to, was so condescending. I have NEVER experienced such horrible customer service when I actually go to the restaurant to eat. It's such a shame, I will NEVER order from them again for take out. I had to actually ask the girl, ""Why are you being so rude to me?!"" She started to laugh and say ""I'm not rude"". I'm still in shock. When my boyfriend went to pick up the order, he said that girl there, threw the receipt at him. Unbelievable. I asked for a supervisor but she clearly didn't want me to speak to him so hopefully he is reading this and can speak to his employees about their customer service. Horrible. I need to state that the food was good, but the service was shameful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-webster?start=20,,,,,
22,Matthew D.,"Rochester, NY",79,39,140.0,4.0,2014-05-27,"One of my favorite restaurants. Great steak fries that are bottomless. They add new burgers often and have great shakes too. They are very busy when I go and usually have great service. My favorite burger is the ""burnin' love"" burger.

13,Sarah G.,"Raleigh, NC",70,433,279.0,4.0,2014-05-30,"I just finished a review for the Greece location and visited this Webster location soon after. I'll begin the same, during pregnancy the smell of burgers sent me running to the nearest loo. I never thought I'd be able to eat them again. LUCKILY, I decided to give them another chance after the babe was born and boy, I'm glad I did!  Food: Red Robin has a fantastic burger! So many choices, it's hard to decide on one. Since I chose the ""Burning Love"" burger at the Greece location, I went with the Guacamole burger at the Webster location. Sooooo good! Though, I ordered it ""bunless"" which, the menu says the burger will be wrapped in lettuce and it came just laying there on the plate. No big deal, just ate it with a knife and fork. Not about to send it back to the kitchen. Haha. Of course, got the bottomless fries again. I did notice that you can get bottomless sweet potato fries OR bottomless steamed broccoli. Interesting. I wonder how many people get more than one serving of broccoli. I'm going to ask the next time I go there. This location didn't have the fancy metal ring which held my fries like at the Greece store but the serving seemed to be bigger.  My husband asked to have an order of fries sent out with our drink order. The girl looked at us like we were crazy. She said she usually couldn't put in an order until food was ordered (not just drinks) but soon a basket of piping hot fries were brought out to our table!! Atmosphere: Eh, not too keen on the atmosphere at this location. Seems a bit ""hokey"" compared to the super classy Greece one. We did choose to eat OUTSIDE because it was so nice out! Love outdoor seating when the weather is warm and sunny! This place always seems to be packed. I remember once we were GOING to eat here but it was waaaaaay too busy so we went to elsewhere. But we'll definitely visit here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-webster,,,,,

26,Renee H.,"Webster, NY",0,1,,5.0,2014-11-19,"For my 10 year anniversary my boyfriend took me to the Webster location. It's been over a year sense I have been to red Robin due to my last experience being so awful. Tonight on the other had, I felt so welcome and my waitress was amazing. Even the manager came over to say hi. I work in customer service as a supervisor and I had to share this with everyone. When someone takes time out to talk to their clients and just be so sweet that really stands out to me. Because of the waitress and how she just went above and beyond for me and my boyfriend to make sure we had a great time, I will come back more often. That's true customer service. So to her I say thank you for being great at her job and giving me great customer service. Thank you De!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-webster?start=20,,,,,
14,Jennifer B.,"Rochester, NY",1,45,12.0,2.0,2015-03-22,"Over priced. Mediocre. Chain food.  I got a Plain cheeseburger with their steak fries.  Husband got a ""gourmet"" black and bleu burger.  Daughter got a cheese pizza.  It was all mediocre. ...  Sweet potato fries were cold. Not sit out cold, but cold. Regular fries were soggy. Cheese pizza was typical kid fare with coagulated cheese and crap sauce.  The blue cheese dressing that came on my husbands burger was very off putting in texture especially with its creamy off-white color... (think deep here). And it was far from being worth $14.xx ... The place was busy. Every once in awhile it's nice to go to a chain restaurant and support corporate America with the rest of the masses to remind yourself to never do it again. ... How could the masses enjoy this over priced lousy food?  Support local. Come here and find out why I say that.  Find a LOCALLY owned restaurant near you.... Skip these dumps.

Delicious mouth watering burgers with some pretty cool flair and design to them. Outstanding apps and seafood as well.  You got to watch out for the bottomless Garlic french fries.  I love them, they are addictive, but too many trips to this place and you will need to hire Omar the tent maker as your tailor.   Grab the family and hit this place up when you are out in Webster.  It is well worth the trip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-webster,,,,,

4,Janelle S.,"Fairport, NY",20,52,34.0,2.0,2017-02-13,"Service here was sub-par. They seemed short-staffed on a Friday evening. The waiter barely made it to our table. We ordered two burgers, mine was the Wedgie burger. It took 30+ minutes for us to get our food. It was marginal. Really no flavor. The guacamole isn't the best guac I've ever had. The side salad was meh. Underwhelming presentation. Not hot, only slightly warm. The waiter came back to check on us immediately after food was served and then not again until 15 minutes after we were done. My boyfriend has ordered fries and wanted more (since they're bottomless but they give you about five at a time), so we were annoyed that the waiter wasn't checking in more frequently or at least being present so we could get his attention.  I don't think we will be back here. I can get a more desirable, HOT burger at Bill Grays, with better and quicker service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-webster,,,,,

We both love the Campfire sauce, and something was off about it this time.  It was sweeter than it usually is.  I don't like their fries without dip, and the dip was not as good as usual, so I didn't truly enjoy anything I ate.  If this had been my first time here, I probably wouldn't be back, but since it wasn't I will give it another chance.  I will probably stick to my Boca burger next time, or a salad.

I got the chicken cesear wrap, boneless buffalo wings with honey sauce and a coffee. The cesear wrap tasted fresh and the boneless wings were coated perfectly in wing sauce. The coffee was standard and woke me up for the movie following dinner.   This restaurant stands out to me because the service is top notch. Our servers here are always super friendly and attentive to our refills (bottomless fries, anyone?). I also noticed the manager mingling around the dining room. He seems like a friendly manager and it shows in how his restaurant is run. A final note: this is a family restaurant so there are kids laughing, crying, and being adorable at every turn.
